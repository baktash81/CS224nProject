00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:47,953
<i>A long time ago,
Britain was ruled</i>

3
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,692
<i>by King Uther Pendragon.</i>

4
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:55,261
<i>But when Uther died
without an heir,</i>

5
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>the land was
torn apart by war.</i>

6
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,535
<i>Many tried to claim the throne</i>

7
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:05,572
<i>and fought bitterly
and endlessly.</i>

8
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:09,376
<i>People's hearts
grew hopeless and hollow.</i>

9
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,614
<i>The country became
lost and leaderless.</i>

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,948
<i>So the wizard Merlin</i>

11
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,388
<i>conjured a magical sword
in a stone called Excalibur</i>

12
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:24,856
<i>and declared that only
Uther's true heir</i>

13
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:26,358
<i>could pull it free.</i>

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,962
<i>Many tried,</i>

15
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,565
<i>but only one succeeded.</i>

16
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:32,831
<i>A boy named Arthur,</i>

17
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:37,137
<i>who had no idea he was
Uther's long-lost son.</i>

18
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:40,706
<i>Arthur grew into a great king.</i>

19
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,674
<i>He turned his enemies
into allies</i>

20
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:47,613
<i>and ruled at a round table,
so that all were equal.</i>

21
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:51,650
<i>He and his knights lived
by a code of chivalry,</i>

22
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:54,151
<i>their hearts pure and noble.</i>

23
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:55,853
<i>But their greatest foe</i>

24
00:01:55,855 --> 00:02:00,126
<i>was Arthur's own
half-sister, Morgana.</i>

25
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:03,261
<i>Convinced she was
the rightful heir,</i>

26
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:06,097
<i>and desperate
to possess Excalibur,</i>

27
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,736
<i>she turned to dark sorcery.</i>

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,473
<i>Arthur fought a fearsome
battle against her,</i>

29
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:16,473
<i>and bound her into
the bowels of the earth.</i>

30
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:20,912
<i>But not before
she swore dark vengeance.</i>

31
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,914
When you are long gone,

32
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,783
when hearts are hollow

33
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:29,623
and the land is lost
and leaderless again,

34
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:33,124
I will return.

35
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:36,096
<i>And so will the sword.</i>

36
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,437
<i>Alex, you're gonna be late.</i>

37
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,874
Okay, okay!

38
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:50,977
I'm coming as fast as I can.

39
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,711
Your homework's
all over the kitchen table.

40
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:00,152
You know, every time you
sleep in

41
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,486
and skip breakfast,
it's like...

42
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:03,822
...starting the day
on an empty battery.

43
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:04,791
I know.

44
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,290
Maybe if you hadn't
left that

45
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,129
till last thing
the night before...

46
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:09,663
Damn.

47
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,399
Here.

48
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:17,902
It's not exactly
the right color, but...

49
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,945
Maybe you can say
it's a solar flare.

50
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,146
Thanks, Mum.

51
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,812
<i>You're listening to the BBC.</i>

52
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,784
<i>It's 7:30am,
it's time for the news.</i>

53
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,927
<i>BBC News at 7:30.</i>

54
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,260
<i>Experts are warning that</i>

55
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:43,729
<i>the world is becoming
more unstable</i>

56
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,462
<i>than it has been
for centuries.</i>

57
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,231
<i>With dictators and strongmen</i>

58
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,400
<i>gaining power
in more countries</i>

59
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,568
<i>than ever before,</i>

60
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,968
<i>global divisions
are increasing</i>

61
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,069
<i>at an alarming rate.</i>

62
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,414
Oh, no.

63
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:05,586
Excuse me.

64
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:08,155
Sorry.

65
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,496
'Scuse me.

66
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:25,872
Bedders!

67
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:27,941
Has anyone seen Bedders?

68
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,345
Bedders! Where are you?

69
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:34,846
Let go of me! Leave me alone!

70
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,949
Put me down!

71
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,885
No, no, and no.

72
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,020
You wanna survive
in this school,

73
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,653
you gotta pay
for the privilege.

74
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,487
You're cutting off
my circulation.

75
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:45,290
I am going to pass out.

76
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:46,692
Keep your voice down

77
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,595
or I'll punch my PIN number
into your legs.

78
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,564
My head's filling up
with blood.

79
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,363
It's going to explode!

80
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,534
I feel weird.

81
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,867
Help!

82
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:58,939
- Somebody help me.
- Hey! Let him go.

83
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,946
Oh, look.
It's the Lego Minifigure boy.

84
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,748
I said, leave him alone.

85
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,519
- Ooh.
- Why should we?

86
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,387
Because there's two of you,

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,456
he's half your size,
and he's my friend.

88
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,093
- Aw.
- Mm.

89
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:29,003
How many times
do I have to tell you?

90
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,372
Don't be a hero.
It's not worth it.

91
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,008
I'm the king around here.

92
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,309
Careful not to drown
in that puddle.

93
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,614
See you later, girls.

94
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,389
Off me!
Get off me, shrimp!

95
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,622
Break it up! Break it up!

96
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:53,326
Move aside, move aside!

97
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:55,362
Alexander Elliot!

98
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,329
I'll give you
one last chance,

99
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:00,064
or I'll just have to give
all three of you detention.

100
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,302
Who started it?

101
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,171
No one.

102
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,004
Your behavior here

103
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,743
directly affects
the rest of your life.

104
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:10,877
You know that, don't you?

105
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,579
It's a tough world out there

106
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,116
and it's getting tougher
all the time.

107
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,483
There's millions of kids
in this country

108
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:20,487
with a better start in life
than you.

109
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:24,158
And the world
is not going to change.

110
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,661
It's you that has to change.

111
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,497
Alex, you saved my life,

112
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:36,266
and now I owe you
my undying loyalty.

113
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:38,136
Like Frodo and Samwise

114
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,603
or Chewbacca and Han

115
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,173
or Donkey and Shrek.

116
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,509
We'll make sure we're on
the same bus every morning.

117
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,045
And I'll wait for you
at lunch break

118
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,112
and after school,

119
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,314
so if they ever dare
try anything...

120
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,984
We already do that, Bedders.

121
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:53,654
Lance and Kaye
rule the school.

122
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:55,756
There's nothing you can do.

123
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,358
There's nothing
either of us can do.

124
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,362
This isn't
junior school anymore.

125
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:03,663
We're nothings now.

126
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,797
We're the most insignificant,

127
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,735
powerless people
in the school.

128
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:12,639
Hey.

129
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,405
Hey!

130
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:15,843
I learnt a new trick.

131
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,311
Hold out your hand.

132
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:23,083
Now squeeze
as hard as you can.

133
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:25,182
Abracadabra!

134
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:26,319
Alakazam!

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,155
Open your hand.

136
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:32,994
Wait, that's not right.

137
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,261
You're supposed to have
both of them.

138
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:39,030
It's a duplication illusion.

139
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:41,135
It's really good
when it works.

140
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,804
Don't worry about it, Bedders.

141
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,174
I'm not in the mood
for magic anymore.

142
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:57,650
<i>Alex, are you okay?</i>

143
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,285
It's not true, is it?

144
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,351
What would make you
jump on someone

145
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:03,089
and start punching them?

146
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:04,458
Alex.

147
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:06,759
They were bullying Bedders.

148
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,428
I tried to stop them.

149
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:11,032
No one said
anything about that.

150
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,001
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you tell someone?

151
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:20,273
Alex, look at you.

152
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,240
Because it would just
make everything worse.

153
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,146
How could telling the truth
make everything worse?

154
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,015
You wouldn't understand.

155
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,054
Dad would understand.

156
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,021
Well...

157
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:37,290
he's not here.

158
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:42,929
But if he was,
I know exactly what he'd say.

159
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:44,898
He'd say that
telling the truth

160
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:48,468
and doing the right thing
never makes anything worse.

161
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:52,039
You always used to
believe that, Alex.

162
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:53,908
Yeah.

163
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:56,276
Well, not anymore.

164
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:06,284
- <i>I can taste it...</i>
- <i>Taste.</i>

165
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,155
<i>...in the rain.</i>

166
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:12,992
- <i>Sense it in the soil.</i>
- <i>Sense it.</i>

167
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,829
<i>What they once had...</i>

168
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,897
<i>is long lost.</i>

169
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,131
<i>Long lost.</i>

170
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,902
- <i>They are divided.</i>
- <i>Divided.</i>

171
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:26,404
- <i>Fearful.</i>
- <i>Fearful.</i>

172
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,907
- <i>Leaderless.</i>
- <i>Leaderless.</i>

173
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,908
<i>Leaderless. Leaderless...</i>

174
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,077
<i>As they grow weaker...</i>

175
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:34,678
<i>Weaker... Weaker...</i>

176
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,414
<i>...I grow stronger.</i>

177
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,283
<i>Stronger.</i>

178
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:43,022
<i>Soon, darkness will dawn.</i>

179
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:48,295
<i>My time will come.</i>

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,302
Come on, no doodling.

181
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:58,439
This is detention,
not art class.

182
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:01,975
Concentrate.

183
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,817
Oi! Alex Elliot!

184
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,820
Wait for us.
We wanna talk to you.

185
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,389
Where are you going?
Don't run away.

186
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,657
What's the matter?
What are you frightened of?

187
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,432
Go, go! Run, get him!

188
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,434
That fast as you can go?

189
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:30,902
We're right behind you!

190
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,573
You're dead now,
you little snitch!

191
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,740
Alex Elliot!

192
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:38,509
Oi! Come here!
Here, boy!

193
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,467
Hey, Lance! I've got him.

194
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,436
Oi. What you running for?

195
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,005
You and me have got
a fight to finish.

196
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,422
We'd better leave.

197
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:12,473
Hello? Is anybody here?

198
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,413
Bedders, tell your dad
we've got homework together.

199
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,384
Come across the garden walls.
You've gotta see what I found.

200
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,155
<i>The sword has returned.</i>

201
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:07,991
<i>Has returned.
Returned. The sword.</i>

202
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:10,861
<i>The sword has been drawn.</i>

203
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:15,600
Let the roots be my senses.

204
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,868
<i>Senses.</i>

205
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,871
Let the land
be my eyes and ears.

206
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,273
<i>Eyes and ears.</i>

207
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:25,245
Find the one who drew it.

208
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:29,413
Find the new king.

209
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:31,749
<i>Find the new king.</i>

210
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:35,320
The sword must be mine.

211
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:38,923
The king must die.

212
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:42,894
<i>The king.
The new king. Find the new king.</i>

213
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:45,397
<i>Find the new king.</i>

214
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,307
Maybe it's a prank.

215
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,480
A YouTube thing.
A social experiment.

216
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,182
Maybe there were
hidden cameras.

217
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:04,550
Look.

218
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:07,820
There's something written
on the guard.

219
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,124
Put it into Google Translate.

220
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:12,492
<i>"Gladius...</i>

221
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,761
<i>Arturi...</i>

222
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,697
<i>filius Tintageli."</i>

223
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:22,468
It's Latin.

224
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:28,375
It means, "Sword of Arthur,
son of Tinta-gel."

225
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:30,743
Who's Tinta-gel?

226
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,246
What are you doing?

227
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:38,117
My dad gave me
a book once, years ago...

228
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:40,884
about the Knights
of the Round Table.

229
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,655
I used to know it
off by heart.

230
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,800
It's not "Tinta-gel,"
it's Tintagel.

231
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:58,304
And Tintagel's not a person,
it's a place...

232
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,874
an island off the coast
of Cornwall.

233
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,208
There's an old
ruined castle there.

234
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:06,011
Some people say it's where
King Arthur was born.

235
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:09,583
I went there once
when I was five.

236
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,018
It's where my dad lived.

237
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,254
The last time I ever saw him.

238
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,224
That's where I was
when he gave me this book.

239
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,825
He even signed it.

240
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,093
Look.

241
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:26,333
"To Alex, my once
and future king. Dad."

242
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,670
Alex, what if
this is a message?

243
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,303
What if you're the only person

244
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,406
who could have pulled
that sword out?

245
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,541
What if it's...

246
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:38,342
- Go on.
- But you'll laugh at me.

247
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:39,779
I won't, I promise.

248
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,583
What if it's
the Sword in the Stone?

249
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:55,495
Behold, Excalibur.

250
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:57,895
Kneel before your king.

251
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,432
Yes, my lord.

252
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,272
You're my closest and oldest
and very best friend.

253
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,242
I knight thee...

254
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:13,579
Sir Beddersvere.

255
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,480
<i>Alex, is your light still on?</i>

256
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,819
- <i>You better be in bed.</i>
- Quick, go.

257
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,254
- Alex.
- What?

258
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,655
You don't really think

259
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:27,393
that's the real
Sword in the Stone, do you?

260
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:30,364
Of course not.

261
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,438
Morning.

262
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:13,239
Bloody hell.

263
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,205
Oh. Forgive me.

264
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,075
I completely forgot
to include clothing

265
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,311
in my Vivifica
Transubtantiatio.

266
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,512
Do you by any chance
have any beetle blood,

267
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:24,914
ground animal bone,
or beaver urine?

268
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:25,883
What?

269
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:27,319
Very well.

270
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:30,590
In that case,
I require your smock.

271
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:42,601
<i>Surely, Officers,</i>

272
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,539
it's not against the law to
take a morning constitutional.

273
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,771
Or to wear
loose-fitting garments

274
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:48,641
that permit fresh air

275
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,043
to circulate around
one's crevices and furrows.

276
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,415
Now, your carriage
seems warm and dry.

277
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:59,050
Take me east at once,
posthaste.

278
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,374
<i>Romeo Charlie zero one,</i>

279
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:24,474
<i>what is your location?</i>

280
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,012
What just happened?

281
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,685
<i>Pay attention,
everybody.</i>

282
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:37,688
We have a new pupil
joining the class today.

283
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,760
Why don't you
introduce yourself?

284
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,498
Greetings, young academicians.
My name is...

285
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:46,065
Mertin.

286
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,632
Yes, that's right.

287
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:50,237
Mertin Ambrosius Caledonensis.

288
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:52,303
And I am a perfectly normal

289
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:54,441
contemporary
British schoolboy.

290
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,676
Quiet down, please.

291
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:02,211
No, Bedders. Absolutely not.

292
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:03,950
We cannot talk to that boy.

293
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:05,583
But he looks cool.

294
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:08,051
At the very least
I bet he's into magic,

295
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,821
and role-playing games,
and <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

296
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:13,324
Listen to me.
For the first time ever,

297
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,560
there's someone in this school
who's more bullyable than us.

298
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,162
We have to stay away from him.

299
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:20,701
As far away as possible.

300
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,833
Some metals are common,

301
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:25,105
like copper,
and are called base metals.

302
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,605
Others are rare and valuable,
like gold,

303
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,474
and are called
precious metals.

304
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:33,277
Now, a long time ago,
people called "alchemists"

305
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,011
believed that you could
change base metals

306
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,446
to precious metals.

307
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:39,316
These sections of
the Earth's crust

308
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:41,484
contain a wealth of history.

309
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:43,554
Ruins, dead bodies,

310
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,823
evidence of past
civilizations.

311
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:50,394
And slowly move your
moons across, between the two.

312
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,762
You will start to see
how these two planets,

313
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:54,632
when their orbits intersect,

314
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:58,403
will cause the upcoming
total solar eclipse.

315
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,838
"Upcoming"?

316
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:01,573
What do you mean, "upcoming"?

317
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,843
When exactly is this
total solar eclipse due?

318
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,846
- Four days' time.
- Four days?

319
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:10,316
God's socks.
This is a catastrophe.

320
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:13,652
A disaster.
I thought it was four years.

321
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,186
Get out of my way!
I need air, space to think!

322
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,195
Alexander Elliot!

323
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,532
It was you who drew the sword.

324
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:29,599
In four moons there will be
darkness in daylight,

325
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,102
the dual realms
will be bridged,

326
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:34,607
and Morgana will return.

327
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,841
Oh, no.

328
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:40,111
You must saddle your steeds,
gird up your armor,

329
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,548
gather your allies!

330
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,948
Go away.

331
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,482
We don't know you,
and we don't want to know you.

332
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,619
Leave us alone!

333
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:51,189
Good people,

334
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:54,291
this realm faces
mortal danger!

335
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:57,562
And this boy among you
drew Excalibur.

336
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:01,902
Who will kneel at his feet
and swear allegiance?

337
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,108
Stop it! Stop that!

338
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:18,016
But Rokas saw it
with his own eyes.

339
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,884
Danielle said they tried
to catch it for two hours,

340
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:21,818
but it escaped.

341
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,023
He did not turn into
an owl, Bedders.

342
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,289
But he said we're
in mortal danger.

343
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,525
And he knew about the sword.

344
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,026
How could he know
about the sword?

345
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:31,764
I don't know.
It's a coincidence.

346
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,034
It doesn't matter,
I've made up my mind.

347
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:36,767
I'm putting it back.

348
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,604
Tomorrow night, after school.

349
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,508
It's stolen property,
and it's a weapon.

350
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:45,278
And it's making everything
go... weird.

351
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:47,813
- But what if...
- But what if what?

352
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:50,582
Nothing.

353
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:52,251
Good night, Bedders.

354
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:27,981
Mum!

355
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:29,848
Mum?

356
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,319
Mum.

357
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:36,856
The sword must be mine.

358
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:51,036
The king must die.

359
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,760
Mertin?

360
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:17,795
What are you doing here?

361
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:21,201
Saving your life, boy.
From that thing.

362
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:22,835
Don't you realize,

363
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,803
appearing in the mortal realm
after sundown

364
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:27,674
is lethal for me?

365
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:33,146
Find me here tomorrow.

366
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:35,781
Without fail.

367
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:39,351
Open the window. Hurry.

368
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:20,156
<i>He was a child, my Lady.</i>

369
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:22,893
<i>A child, a child.</i>

370
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,363
<i>A boy.</i>

371
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:27,434
<i>No more than 12 winters.</i>

372
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:31,102
<i>There was another.</i>

373
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:34,907
<i>Hardly older than
the chosen king.</i>

374
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:37,540
<i>He destroyed our sentinel</i>

375
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:40,280
<i>with an elemental
manipulation.</i>

376
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:42,848
Merlin.

377
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:45,385
A child too.

378
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:49,655
Have I waited so long?

379
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,320
<i>So long.</i>

380
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:54,826
Have I grown so old...

381
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:59,866
that he has grown so young?

382
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:12,875
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

383
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:14,744
Nightfall will be ours.

384
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:16,913
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

385
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:18,080
Nightfall will be ours.

386
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:20,450
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

387
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:21,884
Nightfall will be ours.

388
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:24,020
Awake, my warriors,
cease your slumber.

389
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:25,689
Nightfall will be ours.

390
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:27,657
<i>Nightfall will be ours.</i>

391
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,526
<i>Nightfall will be ours.</i>

392
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:32,265
<i>Nightfall will be ours.</i>

393
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:40,306
Come on, Alex. It's time to
join the land of the living.

394
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,777
<i>That is not Excalibur.</i>

395
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:48,878
Tell me the truth.
Where did you get that thing?

396
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,147
I told you,
on a building site.

397
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:52,782
Then we're taking it
back there. Right now.

398
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:54,651
No. You can't take it away.

399
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:55,788
And you can't keep it.

400
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,689
Alex, it's a dangerous weapon,
and it doesn't belong to you.

401
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,126
Yes, it does.

402
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,326
I pulled it out of a stone

403
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:05,295
and something came
and tried to take it back.

404
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:08,097
Something old and evil
that came out of the ground.

405
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,902
And a boy from school came
and he saved me.

406
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:12,470
And then he turned
into an owl.

407
00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:15,474
And I was wide awake
the whole time, I promise.

408
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:19,244
Did you get that
out of the attic?

409
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:23,749
Alex, I know you're
having a tough time.

410
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:26,152
And I know you miss your dad.

411
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:28,420
But he gave you that book

412
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:32,124
because he wanted you to
grow up to be a good person.

413
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:35,126
Not the kind of person
who gets into fights,

414
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,928
not the kind of person
who believes in fairy tales,

415
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,266
and not the kind of person
who carries...

416
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:44,099
giant, medieval
weapons around.

417
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:45,971
Then why did he write this?

418
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,477
Because he loved you.

419
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,314
Then why did he leave?

420
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:01,753
Maybe I haven't told you
as much as I should about him.

421
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:06,125
He had his battles.
His demons.

422
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,029
But he loved you.

423
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,530
And this has to stop.

424
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:15,298
Now, we're taking that sword
to the police station

425
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,203
and then I'm taking
you to school.

426
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:18,736
Alex!

427
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,403
Put that down. Now.

428
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:21,438
No. It's mine.

429
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,807
- I need it.
- I'm not telling you again.

430
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,709
I have to go,
and I'm taking it with me.

431
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:28,778
Alexander Elliot, don't you
dare leave this house.

432
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,351
Alex.

433
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:33,919
Sorry, Mum.

434
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:41,961
Alex!

435
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:44,463
Alex!

436
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,199
<i>I feel sick, Alex.</i>

437
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:51,067
I've never been outside school
on a weekday

438
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,171
in term time before.

439
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:55,473
Not without adult supervision
and a hi-vis vest.

440
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:58,977
It's just, I'm used to reading
about this kind of thing.

441
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:01,547
I'm not used to it
actually happening.

442
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:03,582
Just calm down, Bedders.

443
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:05,351
Let me do the talking.

444
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:10,656
Ah!

445
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:12,625
Finally.

446
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,194
Take these, follow me.

447
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:20,433
Come! I've taken temporary
lodging above.

448
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:25,268
As I tried to explain
last night,

449
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,203
appearing in the mortal realm
after dark

450
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,908
drains my life force
extremely fast,

451
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,242
let alone contending
with a Mortes Milles.

452
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:36,280
It takes a very particular
potion to restore my strength.

453
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:39,583
Beetle blood, ground bone
and beaver urine.

454
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:42,184
I thought I'd have trouble
finding the ingredients,

455
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:44,954
but Lip Smackin' Chicken
had it all.

456
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:45,925
Really?

457
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,727
The red in this cherryade
derives from beetle blood.

458
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:53,098
The vanilla in this ice cream,
from beaver urine.

459
00:29:54,332 --> 00:29:55,865
And these nuggets
are largely gristle

460
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:57,134
and ground animal bone.

461
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:59,171
Altogether... mm...

462
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,273
utterly invigorating.

463
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:05,508
Mm.

464
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:08,513
Your name isn't Mertin, is it?

465
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:11,114
It's Merlin.

466
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:13,048
An ingenious alias,
don't you think?

467
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,184
Came up with it
on the spur of the moment

468
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:17,322
in order to monitor you
incognito.

469
00:30:18,557 --> 00:30:20,559
I thought Merlin
was supposed to be an old man.

470
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,025
You look about 16.

471
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,394
That's because I live
backwards in time.

472
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:27,029
The older I grow,
the younger I become.

473
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:27,933
Honestly, boy,

474
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,136
do they teach you nothing
in that so-called school?

475
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,203
From now on,

476
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,739
nighttime will be dangerous
for you too, Alexander.

477
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:39,145
At night the penumbra between
light and dark weakens.

478
00:30:39,444 --> 00:30:41,914
The Mortes Milles
will rise again.

479
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:46,182
Mortes Milles? Is that what
came to get me last night?

480
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:48,786
Fallen warriors
from battles of old.

481
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:51,121
Their souls enslaved by evil.

482
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:54,594
For now, they can only
enter this realm after dark.

483
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,662
But...

484
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:02,635
when they rise, time freezes

485
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:05,335
and every mortal
soul disappears,

486
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:07,938
save for the one
who drew the sword

487
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,775
and those who have
been knighted.

488
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:12,644
Their spell is only
broken at sunrise.

489
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,181
Or when every risen warrior...

490
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:17,883
is destroyed.

491
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,319
That's why my mum disappeared.

492
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:24,253
That's why everything went
back to normal after you left.

493
00:31:24,255 --> 00:31:26,891
There are three moons
until the solar eclipse

494
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:29,058
when Morgana will seize
her opportunity

495
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,827
to enter the realm
of the living

496
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:34,367
and retake
what she lost long ago.

497
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:36,066
Excalibur.

498
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,403
Who's Morgana?

499
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:40,403
She was King Arthur's
half-sister.

500
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:43,608
She is greed, entitlement,

501
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,444
vengefulness.

502
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:47,978
And she has awoken.

503
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,247
But why? After all this time.

504
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:52,785
Have you seen the world
outside your window?

505
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:56,452
This land is divided.
Lost and leaderless.

506
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:58,221
Men's hearts have
grown hollow.

507
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:00,091
That's why
her strength returns.

508
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:03,026
And that is why
the sword has returned.

509
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:04,695
And I'm supposed to stop her?

510
00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:07,198
That's ridiculous. I'm 12.

511
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:09,900
I'm not even old enough
to do a paper round.

512
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:11,401
You'll have to find
someone else.

513
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:13,606
It's too dangerous, we'll die.

514
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:17,874
So, there's your sword back.

515
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:21,213
It's been great to meet you,
and good luck with everything.

516
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,523
Your quest has been decided.

517
00:32:31,924 --> 00:32:34,193
There is no turning back.

518
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:56,913
You must find the
entrance to the Underworld.

519
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:59,583
Defeat Morgana
in her own realm

520
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:02,219
before the moon masks the sun,

521
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:05,623
or you, your people,

522
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,590
and the land
on which you live,

523
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:08,827
are doomed.

524
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,032
You have been chosen

525
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:20,438
to save your kingdom
from slavery!

526
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,181
Christmas Day,
that was exhausting.

527
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:35,250
If I have to transform
into my adult self

528
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:37,487
every time I need to
drive a point home,

529
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:39,722
I'll be dead
before the day is done.

530
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:46,296
Oh!

531
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:48,565
Are there no unglazed windows

532
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:52,402
or unblocked chimneys left
in this godforsaken country?

533
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:53,938
Mertin... Merlin, wait.

534
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,271
How do we find the entrance
to the Underworld?

535
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:59,175
- Where do we go?
- You're a king, boy.

536
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:02,211
The path you choose
must be your own.

537
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:07,416
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

538
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:09,352
This is the worst and best

539
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:12,388
and most terrible
and brilliant and frightening

540
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,658
and excellent thing
that's ever happened to me.

541
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,694
We need to go somewhere
no one can find us.

542
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,197
Somewhere we can think.

543
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:21,767
Come on, Bedders.
It's this way.

544
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:32,778
Look.

545
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,379
The inscription.

546
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:38,950
It's just like in the book.

547
00:34:39,218 --> 00:34:40,886
It's all just like
in the book.

548
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:42,622
You were right.

549
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:46,891
He knew.

550
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,261
It's exactly the same
in every story we ever read.

551
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:54,766
King Arthur, Luke Skywalker,
Harry Potter.

552
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,799
None of them
know their fathers,

553
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:58,734
and then something
amazing happens.

554
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:01,138
And they find out they're
descended from powerful,

555
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,641
magical families.

556
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,444
That's me, Bedders. That's me!

557
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:09,649
My mum said he had his battles
and his demons.

558
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:11,816
And now I know what she meant.

559
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:15,655
My dad's a hero.
He's the key to all of this.

560
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:20,191
We have to go to Cornwall.
To Tintagel.

561
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:21,658
We have to find him.

562
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,096
But Cornwall's
hundreds of miles away.

563
00:35:24,662 --> 00:35:26,497
And you haven't seen him
for years.

564
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,066
He'll know where the entrance
to the Underworld is.

565
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:30,935
He'll know
how to defeat Morgana.

566
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,071
He's the only one
who can help us.

567
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,508
Look, Alex.

568
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:37,742
It's already dark.

569
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,410
Merlin said nighttime
would be dangerous.

570
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:44,449
He said the penumbra between
light and dark weakens.

571
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,250
He said...

572
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:48,321
The Mortes Milles
will rise again.

573
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:51,323
Hello, boys.

574
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,958
Nice sword. Looks real.

575
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:55,894
Yeah. Real valuable.

576
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:57,828
Playing little games, are we?

577
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,765
Having fun
with our imaginations?

578
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:01,900
We like games. Can we join in?

579
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:05,438
Give us a quick go with that.
We'll give it back, I promise.

580
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:09,008
Sure. Help yourself.

581
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:15,211
All you have to do
is pull it out of that stone.

582
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:16,214
Easy.

583
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,017
Excuse me, ladies.

584
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,419
Come on.

585
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:25,055
Stay here. Find something
to defend yourself with.

586
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,457
Why? What are you gonna do?

587
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:30,058
What Merlin said.
Gather some allies.

588
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,497
Let me try again.

589
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,365
Okay, ready.

590
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:36,367
One, two, three.

591
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:39,201
I'm the only one who can
pull the sword from the stone.

592
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:40,803
I'm the once and future king.

593
00:36:40,805 --> 00:36:42,705
I'll pull it out
and you can hold it

594
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:44,707
if you both kneel
and let me knight you.

595
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,642
Oh, my God,
you're such a nerd.

596
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,879
You're a king, are you?
Really?

597
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:50,479
Well, you're not royal.

598
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,147
So what kind of a king
are you?

599
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:53,383
Maybe he's a Burger King.

600
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,084
He's too small
to be King Kong.

601
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:56,320
He could be the Lion King.

602
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:59,091
Come on, then, Simba.
Let's see you pull it out.

603
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:04,063
You swear, if I do,
you'll let me knight you both?

604
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:05,498
We swear.

605
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,167
Excuse me.

606
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:15,372
Now, kneel.

607
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:17,774
No way. I don't kneel.
Not for anybody.

608
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:19,712
Do it. Then we get to play.

609
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:25,147
I knight thee,
Lady Kaye.

610
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:28,986
Come on, then. Get on with it.

611
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:31,723
I knight thee,
Sir Lance.

612
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:38,328
What are you gonna
do now, Percy Jockstrap?

613
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,598
Cast a spell? Summon a dragon?

614
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,435
Sort of.

615
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,986
Nightfall will be ours.

616
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:05,057
Move! Hide!

617
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,028
Lance! Run!

618
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:25,844
Lance! Get up! Move!

619
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,752
There's another one.

620
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:41,227
Come on, Lance!

621
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:43,459
Run!

622
00:38:43,461 --> 00:38:44,528
Faster! Go, go!

623
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,265
- Move!
- Hurry!

624
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,604
Tell me I'm dreaming this!

625
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,006
Help me!

626
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,747
They're still coming!

627
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:05,881
- Go!
- Run!

628
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:07,885
Faster!
Out of the way!

629
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:11,757
- Run! Hurry!
- Wait! Wait!

630
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:20,830
Help!
They're right behind me!

631
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,299
Come on, Bedders!

632
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,435
Help!

633
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,000
- Run!
- Bedders!

634
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:26,836
- Don't leave me behind!
- Quickly!

635
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:28,640
- Help!
- Help!

636
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:30,439
Somebody help us!

637
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:31,941
Help!

638
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:34,979
There's no one here!
Everyone's vanished!

639
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:37,649
What the flip's happened?

640
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:40,383
Where's everyone gone?
Why are all these cars empty?

641
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:43,486
It's just like Merlin
said! Everyone's disappeared!

642
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:49,491
Alex, what are you doing?

643
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:52,664
Alex! Run! Alex!

644
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:57,168
They're just made of bones!
We can kill them!

645
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:02,738
- There's two more!
- We can't outrun them.

646
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,207
What are we gonna do?

647
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:05,944
Hey, can anybody drive?

648
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:10,613
- Hurry up, Bedders!
- Come on!

649
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:11,716
Get in!

650
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:14,086
Get off me!

651
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:25,898
We lost one!

652
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:29,301
It's catching up!
On the left! On the left!

653
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,308
Wait for it.

654
00:40:39,077 --> 00:40:40,243
Whoa!

655
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:42,181
Oh!

656
00:40:44,448 --> 00:40:45,682
Get the last one,

657
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:47,785
and everything
will go back to normal!

658
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:50,886
Hold on!

659
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,895
Where did you learn
how to drive?

660
00:40:57,294 --> 00:40:58,664
Mario Kart.

661
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:11,777
What?

662
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,716
- The traffic!
- Stop! Stop!

663
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:41,372
Kaye, thanks.

664
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
You saved us.

665
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:45,310
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

666
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:47,212
Yeah, me too.

667
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:48,781
Until I remembered

668
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:51,015
you tricked us into this
in the first place.

669
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:54,049
You're coming back to my house

670
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:56,084
and you're not leaving
until you explain

671
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:58,089
exactly what just happened.

672
00:41:59,223 --> 00:42:00,857
<i>Now, rewind.</i>

673
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,727
First. You want me
not to smash your faces in?

674
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,926
Yes, please.

675
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:07,631
Then you want us to skip
school tomorrow morning,

676
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,832
go to Cornwall
with this freak new boy,

677
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,801
find your long-lost dad,
kill some demon sorceress,

678
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:15,303
- and save Britain from slavery?
- Yes.

679
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:17,674
And out of all the people
in the entire world,

680
00:42:17,676 --> 00:42:19,808
even though there's already
a royal family,

681
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,877
you're actually
the real, true king?

682
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:24,546
Trust me,
I'm as shocked as you.

683
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:25,948
Well, there's one thing
I don't get.

684
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,352
Why would people like us...
help people like you?

685
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:32,957
Yeah. Why would we, like,
even be seen with you?

686
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,760
Because you're
the strongest people I know.

687
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,296
In the heat of battle
we had each other's backs.

688
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,863
We just saved
each other's lives

689
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:42,633
without even
thinking about it.

690
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,136
And that's exactly
what King Arthur did.

691
00:42:46,205 --> 00:42:49,074
He made his enemies
his allies.

692
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:52,008
He united the warring
tribes of Britain

693
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,276
and formed a band
of loyal knights.

694
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:55,278
And together,

695
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,649
they defeated an enemy
bigger than all of them.

696
00:42:57,982 --> 00:42:59,249
And think about it.

697
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,915
King Arthur's
most loyal knights

698
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:04,687
were called Lancelot,
Kay and Bedivere.

699
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:05,754
So?

700
00:43:05,756 --> 00:43:07,358
So that's your names.

701
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,129
Oh, my God. He's right.

702
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,861
The legend says

703
00:43:11,863 --> 00:43:14,129
Arthur's knights gathered
at a round table

704
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:15,900
so that they were all equal.

705
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,536
And look...

706
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:23,841
Quick, Bedders.
Lift up the flaps.

707
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:31,015
See? None of this
happened by accident.

708
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:33,351
This is destiny.

709
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:35,154
This was meant to be.

710
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:41,225
<i>So they
think themselves knights?</i>

711
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:43,024
<i>How deluded they are.</i>

712
00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:44,225
<i>Deluded.</i>

713
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:47,095
<i>The boy,
Beddersvere, is meek.</i>

714
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:48,230
<i>Meek.</i>

715
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:50,866
<i>Nothing
without his friend.</i>

716
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:52,301
<i>Nothing.</i>

717
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:54,404
<i>The boy, Lance,
is greedy.</i>

718
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:55,106
<i>Greedy.</i>

719
00:43:55,472 --> 00:43:57,640
<i>He plans to take
the sword for himself.</i>

720
00:43:57,642 --> 00:43:59,276
<i>Take the sword.</i>

721
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:02,645
<i>The girl, Kaye,
is clever but callow.</i>

722
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:03,812
<i>Callow.</i>

723
00:44:03,814 --> 00:44:06,017
<i>Beholden to the boy.</i>

724
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:16,128
<i>And the boy himself,
he clings to myth.</i>

725
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:20,198
<i>Trusts in lies.</i>

726
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:24,767
<i>I will prey
on their weaknesses.</i>

727
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:26,102
<i>Weaknesses.</i>

728
00:44:26,104 --> 00:44:28,604
<i>Their faith
will crumble.</i>

729
00:44:28,606 --> 00:44:29,540
<i>Crumble.</i>

730
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,109
<i>Their hope
will turn to hate.</i>

731
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:34,343
<i>Hate.</i>

732
00:44:34,345 --> 00:44:39,147
<i>Their quest
will be their doom!</i>

733
00:45:25,162 --> 00:45:27,095
Oi! What do you think
you're doing?

734
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:31,033
Bravo, Alexander.

735
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:32,567
You've survived the night
unscathed,

736
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,203
emerged with two new allies,

737
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:36,104
and formulated
an excellent plan.

738
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:39,174
To journey to Tintagel,
find your long-lost father,

739
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:41,877
who will then help you find
the entrance to the Underworld

740
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:43,714
and destroy Morgana.

741
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:46,582
You think it's
an excellent plan? Really?

742
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:47,385
Of course it is.

743
00:45:47,618 --> 00:45:50,687
Tintagel Island
is King Arthur's birthplace.

744
00:45:50,955 --> 00:45:52,723
It is strong in magic.

745
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:55,559
The Mortes Milles
cannot touch you there.

746
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,563
Sir Lance, Lady Kaye.

747
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:00,962
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

748
00:46:00,964 --> 00:46:02,497
Do us a favor, Mertin.

749
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:05,069
Don't talk to us. We're only
here for the fights.

750
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:08,404
That's hardly the attitude
of a knight, young man.

751
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:10,609
Where's your respect
for the Chivalric Code?

752
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:14,946
Don't tell me you've never
heard of the Chivalric Code.

753
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,482
Driver!
Stop this coach at once!

754
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:24,720
The Code is the cornerstone
of a civilized society,

755
00:46:24,722 --> 00:46:27,524
the very credo upon which
this nation was built.

756
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:30,091
If you don't know the Code,
then this entire enterprise

757
00:46:30,093 --> 00:46:31,227
is utterly hopeless!

758
00:46:31,229 --> 00:46:32,495
What the hell
is he on about?

759
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:34,897
Excuse me, but why are we
getting off the coach?

760
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:35,897
Shortcut.

761
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:38,667
Follow me. Quickly.
No slacking.

762
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:43,040
Halt!

763
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:45,810
Now, pay close attention.

764
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,944
The Chivalric Code
is the set of rules

765
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:51,116
by which
all noble knights live.

766
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:54,785
Obeying the Code from
the moment the sword is drawn

767
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,022
is what makes you
pure of heart.

768
00:46:57,488 --> 00:47:01,124
And only a knight of
pure heart can slay Morgana.

769
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:03,528
You must commit
the following to memory.

770
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:07,365
Rule one.
Honor those you love.

771
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:08,665
Easy.

772
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:10,399
Yeah, because
you love yourself.

773
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:14,035
Rule two.
Refrain from wanton offense.

774
00:47:14,037 --> 00:47:15,240
What's "wanton"?

775
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:19,077
- It's Chinese food, I think.
- It is not Chinese food.

776
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,678
"Wanton" means deliberate
or unprovoked.

777
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,216
It means don't be rude or
swear or be nasty to people.

778
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:28,920
All right. Don't look at me.

779
00:47:29,254 --> 00:47:30,555
Rule three.

780
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:33,323
Speak the truth at all times.

781
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,624
Easy, again.

782
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,058
That's a lie.

783
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,828
And finally, rule four.

784
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,700
Persevere in any enterprise
until the end.

785
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:45,301
Break any of these rules

786
00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:47,602
from the moment
the sword was drawn,

787
00:47:47,604 --> 00:47:50,608
and your quest is lost
before it has even begun.

788
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:53,779
I trust that is not a problem.

789
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:01,450
Oi! Mini Merlin!
What are you doing?

790
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:03,353
We're not walking to Cornwall!

791
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:05,556
Indeed, we are not.

792
00:48:06,022 --> 00:48:07,390
<i>And for centuries,</i>

793
00:48:07,392 --> 00:48:10,359
<i>historians have puzzled over
the purpose of Stonehenge.</i>

794
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:12,864
Was it a temple?
A burial ground?

795
00:48:13,231 --> 00:48:14,663
Some sort of
astrological clock?

796
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:17,265
No, it is not,
you ignorant buffoon!

797
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:19,502
Stonehenge is
a transport hub.

798
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:21,671
And just because the Romans
knocked half of it down,

799
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:22,772
does not mean it's broken.

800
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,207
Uh, excuse me!

801
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:26,642
The general public's
not permitted

802
00:48:26,644 --> 00:48:29,745
to approach the stones without
the correct authorization!

803
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:38,187
Hey, wait!
Security! Security!

804
00:48:38,189 --> 00:48:39,391
Come on!

805
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:45,694
You see? They're all linked.

806
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:48,665
All the Paleolithic standing
stones in the country.

807
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:51,332
Built as a magical
conveyance system,

808
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:53,537
designed by yours truly.

809
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:56,004
We are now on Bodmin Moor,

810
00:48:56,006 --> 00:48:58,406
140 miles from Stonehenge

811
00:48:58,408 --> 00:49:00,075
and a mere, invigorating

812
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:03,881
20-mile walk due west
to Tintagel Island!

813
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:06,482
Ah...

814
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:09,353
- What did he just say?
- Did he say a 20-mile walk?

815
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,857
The most worthwhile path,
my young friends,

816
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:15,059
is seldom the easiest.

817
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:17,995
- Come on, Bedders.
- I'm coming.

818
00:49:18,828 --> 00:49:21,499
- Come on, Lance!
- I hate this already.

819
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,540
This is further than
I've ever walked in my life.

820
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:34,713
If I could get a signal,
I'd be in an Uber, right now.

821
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:36,847
Perfect.

822
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:39,781
- Let us stop here awhile.
- Oh, thank God!

823
00:49:42,118 --> 00:49:43,588
Not to rest.

824
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:45,555
- To train!
- What?

825
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:47,892
Alexander, hand me the sword.

826
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,026
To learn the basics
of swordcraft,

827
00:49:51,028 --> 00:49:52,861
you will need a weapon, each.

828
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:54,462
A simple duplication spell

829
00:49:54,464 --> 00:49:56,667
for metallic objects
should suffice.

830
00:49:57,935 --> 00:49:59,134
What are you doing, boy?

831
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:01,102
I do magic tricks for a hobby,

832
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:02,971
but I'm no good
at duplication illusions.

833
00:50:02,973 --> 00:50:06,042
So, I'm gonna video what
you do and try and copy it.

834
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,312
I'll be most impressed
if you succeed.

835
00:50:15,986 --> 00:50:17,453
Wow!

836
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:20,057
Now, you have
an army to fight,

837
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,760
a demon to slay,
a country to save.

838
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:25,230
So, let us begin.

839
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:28,066
Your weapons are heavy
and cumbersome,

840
00:50:28,332 --> 00:50:30,167
but you are light and agile.

841
00:50:30,568 --> 00:50:32,303
Use this to your advantage.

842
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:34,035
A grown warrior cannot block

843
00:50:34,037 --> 00:50:35,770
their whole body
with their blade.

844
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:39,243
Nor can they use its weight
to hasten their speed.

845
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:41,142
Use your wits.

846
00:50:41,144 --> 00:50:43,280
Be brave and resolute.

847
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:46,050
And... good luck.

848
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,618
Good luck with what?

849
00:50:56,026 --> 00:50:57,325
What's he doing?

850
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:16,513
I'll fetch some food.

851
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:20,085
A reward for once you've
vanquished your foes.

852
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:22,183
I'm not
vanquishing anything.

853
00:51:22,185 --> 00:51:24,555
That's it for me.
I'm off.

854
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:30,294
Oi! Get off me!

855
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:36,001
Hey!

856
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:45,542
Block the branches.

857
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:50,749
- They're teaching us.
- I know.

858
00:51:58,789 --> 00:51:59,823
Come on then!

859
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,361
You want it?

860
00:52:05,995 --> 00:52:06,962
Try some of this!

861
00:52:06,964 --> 00:52:08,033
Ah!

862
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:13,570
Look what it's doing.

863
00:52:38,328 --> 00:52:39,497
Gotcha!

864
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:53,478
<i>Their quest
will be their doom.</i>

865
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:03,551
<i>The sword must be mine.</i>

866
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:06,187
<i>Must be mine.</i>

867
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:12,763
Help! Something's got me.

868
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,066
Bedders, watch out!

869
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:18,133
<i>Meek.</i>

870
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:22,740
Lance! Kaye! Help!

871
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:25,443
Help! Quickly!

872
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:30,279
It's gonna get the sword.
I'm suffocating! Help!

873
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:32,046
- Help!
- Hold them off.

874
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:35,051
Help! Help us!

875
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:36,588
Lance, help.

876
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:39,824
<i>Take the sword and push.</i>

877
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:41,057
Help me.

878
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,058
If you're
the once and future king,

879
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,128
you can help yourself.

880
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:47,164
No. Lance! No!

881
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,401
Lance!

882
00:53:51,702 --> 00:53:53,734
Lance!
What are you doing?

883
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:54,803
Help!

884
00:53:54,805 --> 00:53:56,772
They'll kill you.
They'll kill us all.

885
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:59,877
- Lance, help! Help!
- No!

886
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:06,182
Come on, then!
Come and get it.

887
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,549
Let's see what you've got,
you stupid twigs.

888
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:17,258
Help me!
I can't breathe! Help!

889
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,394
It's pulling me under!

890
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:21,397
- Help! I can't breathe!
- Bedders! Lance!

891
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:23,535
- Help me!
- Kaye!

892
00:54:24,702 --> 00:54:25,602
Help!

893
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:28,371
Merlin!

894
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:30,538
Merlin! Merlin!

895
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,843
Merlin! Help us!

896
00:54:33,142 --> 00:54:34,508
I can't breathe!

897
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,778
Merlin! Merlin!

898
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,149
Help us!

899
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:42,687
Merlin!
Help us!

900
00:54:43,053 --> 00:54:43,919
Merlin!

901
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:45,723
Help us!
I can't breathe!

902
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:00,638
Merlin. Look.

903
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:02,506
Quickly!

904
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:04,776
Merlin!

905
00:55:05,709 --> 00:55:08,046
Merlin.
Are you okay?

906
00:55:08,479 --> 00:55:11,082
She's even stronger
than I feared.

907
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:13,149
We need beetle blood.

908
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,920
Ground animal bone.
Something to revive him.

909
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,823
It's no use. I'm finished.

910
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:24,493
Until sunrise, you are alone.

911
00:55:30,401 --> 00:55:33,035
Merlin. Don't go.

912
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:34,138
Merlin.

913
00:55:38,642 --> 00:55:41,646
If you'd helped me,
we could've fought them off.

914
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:44,048
You nearly got us all killed.

915
00:55:44,414 --> 00:55:45,716
Give me the sword.

916
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:47,217
No chance.

917
00:55:48,218 --> 00:55:49,553
Like I told you...

918
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:51,689
I'm the king around here.

919
00:55:59,162 --> 00:56:00,764
Kaye, please.

920
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,736
What are we
gonna do, Alex?

921
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:09,906
Merlin's not coming
back till sunrise.

922
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,674
The Mortes Milles
will come for us at sunset.

923
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:13,642
And we haven't even

924
00:56:13,644 --> 00:56:14,879
- got the sword.
- Bedders.

925
00:56:15,713 --> 00:56:17,247
Please, I'm trying to think.

926
00:56:18,149 --> 00:56:19,150
Stop talking.

927
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:25,321
No.

928
00:56:25,656 --> 00:56:27,488
You always tell me
to stop talking,

929
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,259
and what I'm saying
is always right.

930
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,095
And this time...

931
00:56:31,528 --> 00:56:33,630
This time I'm gonna do
something about it.

932
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,569
Bedders, wait!

933
00:56:39,002 --> 00:56:40,669
The water's
getting deeper.

934
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:42,138
I don't care.

935
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:44,175
Give him back the sword.

936
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:51,182
It's not yours. Alex drew it.
It chose him. It's his.

937
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:54,718
Here we go again.

938
00:56:59,455 --> 00:57:00,658
That'll teach him.

939
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,194
Leave him alone!

940
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:07,598
I said, leave him alone.

941
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,698
Why should we?

942
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,635
Because you always
ruin everything.

943
00:57:11,968 --> 00:57:14,303
Because you're a liar
and a cheat and a bully.

944
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,073
You're a bad person.

945
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:22,711
I wish I'd never
asked you to join in.

946
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:24,580
All you ever cared about
is yourself.

947
00:57:24,582 --> 00:57:26,381
Yeah? So what if I do?

948
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:28,149
I know why
you're a bully

949
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,618
and a cheat and a liar.

950
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,356
I know why both of you are.

951
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:34,122
It's because you're scared.

952
00:57:34,124 --> 00:57:36,857
You're scared
you're a nothing. A nobody.

953
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:39,361
You're scared you're not gonna
get anywhere or be anyone.

954
00:57:39,363 --> 00:57:41,663
You think all that matters
is how strong you are

955
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:42,765
and how much money you've got.

956
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:44,499
Why don't you
shut up and fight?

957
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:47,903
But it shouldn't be like that.
That's why the sword came.

958
00:57:47,905 --> 00:57:49,437
That's what we're
trying to change.

959
00:57:49,439 --> 00:57:51,841
Yeah? Well, who made you
better than everyone else?

960
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,408
Who made you king?

961
00:58:08,124 --> 00:58:09,424
Lance, no!

962
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,904
You broke it.

963
00:58:22,906 --> 00:58:24,374
You broke Excalibur.

964
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:27,412
You broke everything.

965
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,123
That's right.
Walk away.

966
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:43,094
Look after yourself,
just like you always do.

967
00:58:44,194 --> 00:58:45,263
Maybe you're right.

968
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:50,166
Maybe he is a liar
and a cheat and a bully.

969
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,836
Maybe he is scared
and selfish.

970
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:54,805
Maybe we both are.

971
00:58:55,738 --> 00:58:57,007
But why wouldn't we be?

972
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,142
That is how the world works.

973
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:02,914
Nothing you or anyone does
is ever gonna change that.

974
00:59:03,613 --> 00:59:05,215
I'm sorry we picked on you.

975
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:07,851
I'm sorry he broke the sword.

976
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,020
But we're not knights.

977
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:12,890
We never were,
and we never will be.

978
00:59:13,723 --> 00:59:15,292
You're better off without us.

979
00:59:15,691 --> 00:59:18,261
No. You're wrong.

980
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,565
We can't do this without you.

981
00:59:20,897 --> 00:59:23,066
You're Sir Lancelot
and Lady Kaye.

982
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,868
We need you!

983
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,905
It's too late.

984
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:30,274
No, it's not.

985
00:59:31,209 --> 00:59:32,276
Give me my book.

986
00:59:33,142 --> 00:59:35,112
The book always knows
what to do.

987
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:41,953
The Lady of the Lake,
Excalibur's guardian.

988
00:59:43,553 --> 00:59:47,225
She's in every body of water.
So maybe she's in this one.

989
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,627
If I'm the once
and future king...

990
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,696
if Lance and Kaye and Bedders

991
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:57,566
are my loyal and brave
and worthy knights,

992
00:59:57,568 --> 00:59:59,535
and if this is our destiny...

993
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:01,472
then, Lady of the Lake...

994
01:00:02,439 --> 01:00:04,040
return Excalibur.

995
01:00:16,986 --> 01:00:19,389
I thought something
magic was gonna happen.

996
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:21,224
Oh, well.

997
01:00:22,026 --> 01:00:23,528
It was worth a try.

998
01:00:40,077 --> 01:00:40,977
Hey.

999
01:00:41,477 --> 01:00:43,377
- Hey!
- Alex!

1000
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:44,281
Bedders!

1001
01:00:53,823 --> 01:00:55,026
Wow.

1002
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,835
I think that's yours.

1003
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:09,039
And this is yours.

1004
01:01:34,097 --> 01:01:35,663
We're dry.

1005
01:01:35,665 --> 01:01:38,301
From now on,
we stick together.

1006
01:01:38,702 --> 01:01:40,000
As equals.

1007
01:01:40,002 --> 01:01:42,805
No dishonor. No lying.

1008
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:46,209
No wanton offense.
And no giving up.

1009
01:01:46,676 --> 01:01:47,944
Swear it.

1010
01:01:48,812 --> 01:01:50,114
I swear.

1011
01:01:52,182 --> 01:01:53,384
I swear.

1012
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,752
I thought we weren't
supposed to swear.

1013
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,955
Lance.

1014
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:11,468
Hey.

1015
01:02:13,002 --> 01:02:14,939
Are you kids okay?

1016
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:18,641
Thank you. Thank you, God.

1017
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:21,444
You look like
you've been through the wars.

1018
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:25,748
What was it, then?
Activity day? School trip?

1019
01:02:26,182 --> 01:02:28,251
Did you get separated
or something?

1020
01:02:28,685 --> 01:02:29,687
Listen...

1021
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:32,088
this is gonna sound
really weird,

1022
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:35,357
but if all four of us
and these ponies disappear,

1023
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,390
don't worry.

1024
01:02:36,392 --> 01:02:38,528
I promise we'll
get them back to you.

1025
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:40,431
I beg your pardon?

1026
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:49,537
Whoa.
They just vanished.

1027
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,441
Alex, the sword.

1028
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:56,245
Guys, I think we're gonna
have to learn how to ride.

1029
01:02:56,979 --> 01:02:58,712
These ponies
are way too small.

1030
01:02:58,714 --> 01:02:59,913
They're for little girls.

1031
01:02:59,915 --> 01:03:01,915
Those dead things
were double the size.

1032
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:04,051
Do it like
show jumpers on TV.

1033
01:03:04,053 --> 01:03:06,087
Left rein to go left,
right rein to go right,

1034
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:07,790
bounce up and down
in the saddle.

1035
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:11,127
They're coming. I can feel it.

1036
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:17,265
Meek.

1037
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:20,071
They're here!

1038
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,571
They're right
behind us.

1039
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:25,076
Go, go, gallop!

1040
01:03:27,477 --> 01:03:28,944
I don't know what
I'm doing.

1041
01:03:28,946 --> 01:03:30,479
I can't do this!

1042
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:31,615
I'm gonna fall off!

1043
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:38,388
Greedy. Greedy.

1044
01:03:40,723 --> 01:03:41,689
Callow.

1045
01:03:42,926 --> 01:03:45,227
This way, into the forest!

1046
01:03:45,229 --> 01:03:47,397
The trees will slow them down!

1047
01:03:53,636 --> 01:03:56,272
Come on,
my little pony. Go faster!

1048
01:03:56,606 --> 01:03:57,707
They're catching up!

1049
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:09,753
His quest will be his doom.

1050
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:17,294
I got one!

1051
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,630
He got one!

1052
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,066
Bedders has fallen off!

1053
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:27,267
Go get him.
We'll distract them.

1054
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:29,072
They'll follow the sword.

1055
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,675
Bedders, I'm coming for you!

1056
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,281
Meek.

1057
01:04:42,852 --> 01:04:45,488
Faster, Alex! Faster.

1058
01:04:46,022 --> 01:04:47,522
Nothing.

1059
01:04:52,127 --> 01:04:53,530
Come on, Bedders.

1060
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,435
Go, go!

1061
01:05:07,243 --> 01:05:09,280
Bedders, you made it.

1062
01:05:13,684 --> 01:05:14,584
Oh, no.

1063
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:21,859
Jump!

1064
01:05:33,035 --> 01:05:35,303
I did it! I did it!

1065
01:05:35,305 --> 01:05:37,675
Ride!
As fast as you can.

1066
01:06:04,066 --> 01:06:05,401
I've got an idea.

1067
01:06:05,736 --> 01:06:07,504
Get off. Follow me.

1068
01:06:11,341 --> 01:06:13,577
- What's he doing?
- Alex!

1069
01:06:19,015 --> 01:06:20,316
Let's go!

1070
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:56,520
There it is.
Tintagel Island.

1071
01:07:05,694 --> 01:07:06,729
You know...

1072
01:07:07,597 --> 01:07:10,233
we really should
huddle together for warmth.

1073
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,703
No way. I'm not huddling
with anyone.

1074
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:15,973
I don't huddle.

1075
01:07:51,975 --> 01:07:53,544
Good luck, Alex.

1076
01:08:27,977 --> 01:08:29,512
Stay. Stay.

1077
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:33,915
Hello.

1078
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,718
I wonder if you can help me.

1079
01:08:36,986 --> 01:08:38,555
My name's Alexander Elliot.

1080
01:08:39,088 --> 01:08:40,857
I'm looking for my father.

1081
01:08:43,325 --> 01:08:45,127
You don't remember me,
do you?

1082
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:46,594
I'm Sophie.

1083
01:08:46,596 --> 01:08:48,964
I'm your aunt.
I'm your dad's sister.

1084
01:08:49,998 --> 01:08:53,835
Sorry if I'm staring,
but you look just like him.

1085
01:08:53,837 --> 01:08:56,807
I have to talk to him.
It's important.

1086
01:08:57,641 --> 01:08:59,941
More important than anything
in the world.

1087
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:03,814
You came all the way here
from London by yourself?

1088
01:09:04,213 --> 01:09:05,915
Does your mum even know
you're here?

1089
01:09:07,617 --> 01:09:09,250
All right,
then we have to call her.

1090
01:09:09,252 --> 01:09:11,455
No, this is nothing
to do with her.

1091
01:09:12,955 --> 01:09:13,923
Please don't.

1092
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,526
This is something
I have to do on my own.

1093
01:09:17,293 --> 01:09:20,328
Well, what did your mum
tell you about him?

1094
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,533
She said they were too young
when they had me.

1095
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,968
He had other things
going on in his life.

1096
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:28,305
She said he was
battling demons.

1097
01:09:28,638 --> 01:09:30,406
I didn't know what
she meant...

1098
01:09:30,873 --> 01:09:31,841
but I do now.

1099
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:33,273
You do?

1100
01:09:33,275 --> 01:09:35,745
It's okay. You don't
have to lie to me.

1101
01:09:36,245 --> 01:09:37,713
I know who he really was.

1102
01:09:37,948 --> 01:09:40,017
Then why would you
want to find him?

1103
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:41,952
What do you mean?

1104
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:45,622
He drank.

1105
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:49,493
He was angry at everything
and everyone.

1106
01:09:50,226 --> 01:09:52,363
He wasn't a good man, Alex.

1107
01:09:53,629 --> 01:09:56,266
He lived here
for a while, years back.

1108
01:09:56,867 --> 01:09:59,867
That's when your mum
brought you to see him.

1109
01:09:59,869 --> 01:10:03,540
She thought he might've
changed, but he hadn't.

1110
01:10:04,274 --> 01:10:06,443
I don't even know
where he is anymore.

1111
01:10:07,377 --> 01:10:10,481
Like you said,
he had his demons.

1112
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:13,717
But I meant real demons.

1113
01:10:13,984 --> 01:10:15,517
Magical demons,

1114
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:17,550
like King Arthur fought.

1115
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:19,422
Like in the book he gave me.

1116
01:10:22,992 --> 01:10:26,729
You don't understand.
I'm the once and future king,

1117
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:28,130
and he knew.

1118
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:32,136
He wrote me this message
and he's waiting for me.

1119
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,475
But, Alex...

1120
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:40,977
your mum bought you this book.

1121
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:43,846
This is her writing.

1122
01:10:46,615 --> 01:10:48,148
- I want it!
- Mine!

1123
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,617
- I wanna be king.
- I wanna be queen.

1124
01:10:50,619 --> 01:10:52,252
I wanna be a king.

1125
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:54,022
Alex, what happened?

1126
01:10:54,024 --> 01:10:55,926
- Did you find him?
- What did he say?

1127
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:17,047
My dad's not here.

1128
01:11:18,248 --> 01:11:19,783
And he's not a hero.

1129
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:22,586
He didn't care about me.

1130
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,788
And he didn't want to know me.

1131
01:11:25,888 --> 01:11:28,091
He didn't even
give me the book.

1132
01:11:32,361 --> 01:11:33,997
My mum lied to me.

1133
01:11:34,964 --> 01:11:36,165
It's all a lie.

1134
01:11:38,368 --> 01:11:39,736
I hate her!

1135
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:50,379
Hey, Alex.

1136
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:52,748
I have to show you something.

1137
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,885
Hold out your hand.

1138
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,625
Now squeeze
as hard as you can.

1139
01:12:14,637 --> 01:12:16,239
And open your hand.

1140
01:12:20,976 --> 01:12:25,313
I did it. I couldn't sleep,
so I practiced and practiced,

1141
01:12:25,315 --> 01:12:26,781
and now I can do it.

1142
01:12:26,783 --> 01:12:28,852
I can do real magic.

1143
01:12:31,486 --> 01:12:34,024
You can't give up,
it's not allowed.

1144
01:12:34,457 --> 01:12:37,427
We're Han and Chewie,
Frodo and Samwise.

1145
01:12:37,627 --> 01:12:41,097
We can't give up because...
look how far we've come.

1146
01:12:42,598 --> 01:12:43,632
He's right.

1147
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,102
You've survived three nights
against the Mortes Milles.

1148
01:12:47,104 --> 01:12:48,435
Hundreds of them.

1149
01:12:48,437 --> 01:12:50,371
All leathery and on fire,

1150
01:12:50,373 --> 01:12:53,076
with their faces half
falling off and everything.

1151
01:12:53,342 --> 01:12:54,577
You got us here.

1152
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,412
You turned us from enemies
into allies,

1153
01:12:57,646 --> 01:13:00,316
just like King Arthur did,
just like in the legend.

1154
01:13:01,717 --> 01:13:05,788
You drew Excalibur, Alex.
Nothing else matters.

1155
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:10,227
This book
you covet, Alexander...

1156
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:11,962
Not bad.

1157
01:13:12,628 --> 01:13:15,497
Pretty illustrations, but...

1158
01:13:16,132 --> 01:13:20,070
...not entirely accurate.

1159
01:13:20,637 --> 01:13:24,738
Remember, legends
are mere rumors

1160
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,341
whispered down the centuries.

1161
01:13:26,676 --> 01:13:29,643
Written and rewritten,
told and retold.

1162
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:32,013
Sometimes by
the rich and powerful

1163
01:13:32,015 --> 01:13:34,717
so they can hold on to power.

1164
01:13:35,051 --> 01:13:38,219
The sword doesn't care
who your parents are.

1165
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:42,456
It doesn't choose
by birth or blood, Alexander,

1166
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,128
but by heart and mind.

1167
01:13:45,662 --> 01:13:50,734
If your legends say different,
then perhaps...

1168
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:53,803
you must write them anew.

1169
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,745
But we're right back
where we started.

1170
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:05,481
We don't know where the
entrance to the Underworld is

1171
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:07,751
and there's only one more
night until the eclipse.

1172
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,283
You're a king, Alexander.

1173
01:14:10,285 --> 01:14:12,387
A leader, not a follower.

1174
01:14:12,654 --> 01:14:14,456
You need nothing

1175
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:17,694
but that which
you already have.

1176
01:14:27,235 --> 01:14:28,238
I've got it.

1177
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,407
I know. I know where it is.

1178
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:34,608
That's lovely.

1179
01:14:37,046 --> 01:14:39,682
Excuse me, please.
Sorry, this is an emergency.

1180
01:14:40,048 --> 01:14:40,749
Sorry.

1181
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,349
Stand back, please.
We're on a mission.

1182
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:44,921
Clear some space,
quick as you can. Thank you.

1183
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:47,356
It's the same place.

1184
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,160
Glastonbury Tor.

1185
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,930
That's where
Arthur fought Morgana.

1186
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:57,630
Lance, Kaye,
go along the cliff,

1187
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:59,133
find the horses
and tie them up

1188
01:14:59,135 --> 01:15:00,867
at the top of the high street,
then meet us

1189
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,270
at the amusement arcade.

1190
01:15:02,605 --> 01:15:05,042
Bedders, you come with me.

1191
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:08,812
We're knights.

1192
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,082
We've got a quest to finish.

1193
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:34,203
All clear.
Do it, Bedders. Go.

1194
01:15:44,146 --> 01:15:45,246
It's working.

1195
01:15:45,248 --> 01:15:48,085
Bedders, you're a genius.

1196
01:16:04,534 --> 01:16:05,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

1197
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:06,502
Hello.

1198
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:07,902
We'd like to buy
some armor, please.

1199
01:16:07,904 --> 01:16:09,372
Do you take 50p pieces?

1200
01:16:56,919 --> 01:17:00,054
The sun sets.
And if you do not defeat her,

1201
01:17:00,056 --> 01:17:01,825
then it sets
for the last time.

1202
01:17:02,324 --> 01:17:05,995
For tomorrow, the moon masks
the sun and all is lost.

1203
01:17:06,895 --> 01:17:09,498
<i>This battle is yours, not mine.</i>

1204
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,269
<i>Journey with care...</i>

1205
01:17:13,369 --> 01:17:15,971
<i>be brave, chivalrous...</i>

1206
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:19,141
<i>and remember the Code.</i>

1207
01:17:49,338 --> 01:17:50,506
There's no doorway.

1208
01:17:50,905 --> 01:17:52,374
There's nothing here.

1209
01:17:52,976 --> 01:17:54,474
I don't understand.

1210
01:17:56,312 --> 01:17:57,980
Alex, look.

1211
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:06,355
Let me try something.

1212
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:31,614
This is too creepy.

1213
01:18:32,382 --> 01:18:35,285
It's like no one's
been down here for centuries.

1214
01:18:35,552 --> 01:18:37,320
Not since the Dark Ages,

1215
01:18:37,852 --> 01:18:39,556
when Arthur trapped Morgana.

1216
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:42,124
We're the very first.

1217
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:45,127
Four doorways.

1218
01:18:45,628 --> 01:18:46,893
Maybe we take one each.

1219
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:48,327
What if it's a trick?

1220
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:50,296
What if she's trying
to separate us?

1221
01:18:50,298 --> 01:18:53,569
Right. We should stick
together, whatever happens.

1222
01:18:53,869 --> 01:18:56,338
But... which door?

1223
01:18:59,941 --> 01:19:02,511
Wait. The sword will tell us.

1224
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:14,023
It's this way,
behind the vines.

1225
01:19:52,794 --> 01:19:54,562
Look at the walls.

1226
01:19:54,564 --> 01:19:56,066
They're moving.

1227
01:19:56,832 --> 01:19:58,535
They're coming for us.

1228
01:20:03,873 --> 01:20:05,473
They're everywhere!

1229
01:20:08,144 --> 01:20:10,512
Stay close. Form a circle.

1230
01:20:16,084 --> 01:20:17,518
There's too many!

1231
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,723
Lance!

1232
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,662
Kaye!

1233
01:20:27,129 --> 01:20:28,765
Alex!

1234
01:20:29,531 --> 01:20:31,101
They've got me!

1235
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:35,768
Alex, look!

1236
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:39,273
You have to go. Now.

1237
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:40,744
I'll hold them off.

1238
01:20:41,578 --> 01:20:42,479
Now!

1239
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:44,748
Go get her!

1240
01:21:29,225 --> 01:21:31,727
Alex! Alex, we're up here!

1241
01:21:31,927 --> 01:21:33,063
Alex!

1242
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:35,732
She's here! Be careful!

1243
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:38,802
Let them go!

1244
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,991
Welcome, boy.

1245
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:06,794
<i>Boy.</i>

1246
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,496
I've been watching you.

1247
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:10,863
<i>You.</i>

1248
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:14,068
You've traveled so far.

1249
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,001
<i>So far.</i>

1250
01:22:16,003 --> 01:22:18,839
Fought so bravely.

1251
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:20,340
<i>Bravely.</i>

1252
01:22:20,342 --> 01:22:22,812
I've seen your world.

1253
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:25,447
How you live.

1254
01:22:25,981 --> 01:22:27,716
The myths you believe.

1255
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:30,386
Who you trust.

1256
01:22:31,721 --> 01:22:35,859
It's all lies.

1257
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:40,429
Merlin lied to you.

1258
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:42,932
Your mother lied to you.

1259
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:48,137
You have no noble blood,
you have no army.

1260
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:51,505
You can't win.

1261
01:22:55,977 --> 01:22:59,481
The world is rotten,
Alexander.

1262
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:01,383
That's not true!

1263
01:23:01,617 --> 01:23:03,218
Oh, but it is.

1264
01:23:06,622 --> 01:23:09,723
You sought the truth, child,

1265
01:23:09,725 --> 01:23:11,260
and you have found it.

1266
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:14,495
- You are nothing...
- <i>Nothing.</i>

1267
01:23:14,497 --> 01:23:17,197
- ...but a lowborn serf.
- <i>Serf.</i>

1268
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,399
- Know your place.
- Place.

1269
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:25,440
I am
the last living Pendragon.

1270
01:24:02,244 --> 01:24:04,714
The land is mine.

1271
01:24:05,047 --> 01:24:07,883
The sword is mine.

1272
01:24:08,284 --> 01:24:10,853
You are mine.

1273
01:24:14,824 --> 01:24:15,857
You're right.

1274
01:24:18,827 --> 01:24:19,896
I'm nothing.

1275
01:24:26,502 --> 01:24:27,537
Take it.

1276
01:24:51,526 --> 01:24:55,464
Lance, Bedders, Kaye, quickly!
This way! Hurry!

1277
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:24,993
I think we did it.

1278
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:27,030
That was amazing.

1279
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:30,732
All hail the once
and future king.

1280
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:37,906
No, please don't.

1281
01:25:38,406 --> 01:25:40,909
Really, it's embarrassing.

1282
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:46,446
If they catch us
with Excalibur,

1283
01:25:46,448 --> 01:25:47,846
they'll take it away.

1284
01:25:47,848 --> 01:25:49,950
- We can't risk it.
- You're right.

1285
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:53,252
Is the Lady of the Lake
really in every body of water

1286
01:25:53,254 --> 01:25:54,720
in the whole of Britain?

1287
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:56,723
Like, even
in a swimming pool?

1288
01:25:56,725 --> 01:25:58,895
- Or a bucket of water?
- Or a puddle?

1289
01:25:59,762 --> 01:26:00,797
Stand back.

1290
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,708
Guess that's a "yes," then.

1291
01:26:18,012 --> 01:26:19,414
See you, sword.

1292
01:26:20,281 --> 01:26:21,818
See you when we see you.

1293
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,830
Where are you going, Alex?

1294
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:37,531
Aren't you going home?

1295
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:41,367
I'm going over the walls.
Then through the back window.

1296
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:42,570
Why?

1297
01:26:43,004 --> 01:26:44,673
I can't face her, Bedders.

1298
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,176
Not tonight. I'm too tired.

1299
01:26:48,677 --> 01:26:50,279
What are you going
to tell her?

1300
01:26:50,678 --> 01:26:53,147
The same as you.
The truth.

1301
01:26:53,582 --> 01:26:55,985
They won't believe us.
No one will.

1302
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,521
So what?

1303
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:00,856
It's over now.

1304
01:27:02,257 --> 01:27:03,926
Good night, Sir Beddersvere.

1305
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:09,464
That was a great adventure.

1306
01:27:09,966 --> 01:27:12,702
Yeah, it really was.

1307
01:27:13,503 --> 01:27:15,171
Good night,
Your Highness-ness.

1308
01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:35,048
It didn't work.
She's not dead.

1309
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:35,952
No.

1310
01:28:36,985 --> 01:28:38,518
You merely wounded her.

1311
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,386
Her fury and resolve
are doubled

1312
01:28:40,388 --> 01:28:42,087
and the eclipse
is in six hours.

1313
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:45,326
But why? I did everything
you told me to do.

1314
01:28:45,328 --> 01:28:47,530
Think, boy. Think!

1315
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:49,832
The Code.

1316
01:28:50,732 --> 01:28:52,601
It must be the Code.

1317
01:28:53,502 --> 01:28:56,873
But... I refrained
from wanton offense.

1318
01:28:57,739 --> 01:28:59,908
I spoke the truth
at all times.

1319
01:29:00,508 --> 01:29:01,843
I persevered...

1320
01:29:05,513 --> 01:29:07,048
"Honor those you love."

1321
01:29:17,193 --> 01:29:18,194
Mum.

1322
01:29:22,797 --> 01:29:23,798
Alex.

1323
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:29,370
How could you do this?

1324
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,836
The police have been
looking for you.

1325
01:29:30,838 --> 01:29:32,237
I've been worried sick.

1326
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:35,211
Oh, thank God you're back.

1327
01:29:37,846 --> 01:29:40,883
Mum, I've got something
to tell you.

1328
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,619
We went on a quest
to Tintagel.

1329
01:29:45,387 --> 01:29:46,856
I met my Aunt Sophie.

1330
01:29:47,256 --> 01:29:49,124
I know. She called.

1331
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:51,327
I know you lied to me
about the book.

1332
01:29:52,394 --> 01:29:53,296
I know...

1333
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:56,265
he didn't even sign it.

1334
01:29:57,431 --> 01:29:58,700
You did.

1335
01:30:00,168 --> 01:30:04,272
I know Dad didn't care
about neither of us.

1336
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:07,610
I'm so sorry, Alex.

1337
01:30:08,243 --> 01:30:10,346
I'm sorry I lied, I just...

1338
01:30:11,713 --> 01:30:16,584
I... I just... I wanted you
to believe he was good.

1339
01:30:16,952 --> 01:30:19,252
I thought that if you
knew the truth,

1340
01:30:19,254 --> 01:30:22,056
it would hurt you, change you.

1341
01:30:22,324 --> 01:30:24,860
No, I'm sorry.

1342
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,796
I'm sorry I was
angry with you.

1343
01:30:29,498 --> 01:30:30,967
Nothing's your fault.

1344
01:30:31,967 --> 01:30:32,868
Nothing.

1345
01:30:36,437 --> 01:30:38,339
You were just trying
to protect me.

1346
01:30:38,606 --> 01:30:40,810
But you don't need to anymore.

1347
01:30:46,882 --> 01:30:48,651
There's something
I have to do.

1348
01:30:50,119 --> 01:30:51,287
I have to go to school.

1349
01:30:52,419 --> 01:30:53,888
And I have to take the sword.

1350
01:31:05,467 --> 01:31:06,469
Alex...

1351
01:31:06,968 --> 01:31:09,102
we have to have a serious talk
about that sword

1352
01:31:09,104 --> 01:31:11,404
and this whole
King Arthur thing.

1353
01:31:11,406 --> 01:31:14,275
We will. But I have to
show you something first.

1354
01:31:17,245 --> 01:31:19,815
Everything I said
about the sword is true.

1355
01:31:20,348 --> 01:31:21,283
I can prove it.

1356
01:31:21,516 --> 01:31:23,049
But first, we have to promise

1357
01:31:23,051 --> 01:31:24,720
never to lie to each other
ever again.

1358
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,190
To always trust each other,
whatever happens.

1359
01:31:28,656 --> 01:31:29,990
Do you promise?

1360
01:31:29,992 --> 01:31:31,060
I promise.

1361
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:32,928
I promise, too.

1362
01:31:33,561 --> 01:31:35,163
Now, don't freak out, okay?

1363
01:31:38,766 --> 01:31:39,968
Lady of the Lake...

1364
01:31:40,769 --> 01:31:42,404
this is Alexander Elliot.

1365
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:45,306
If my quest is noble and true,

1366
01:31:46,341 --> 01:31:47,943
please return Excalibur.

1367
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:12,266
All the time I was
telling you to obey the Code,

1368
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:14,202
I'd broken it myself.

1369
01:32:14,636 --> 01:32:15,935
Morgana's not dead.

1370
01:32:15,937 --> 01:32:17,469
- Oh, no.
- You're kidding.

1371
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:18,773
She's coming back...

1372
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,709
into the real world.

1373
01:32:21,443 --> 01:32:23,044
That's why we need defenses.

1374
01:32:24,312 --> 01:32:26,612
A fortress, a castle.

1375
01:32:26,614 --> 01:32:28,147
The Mortes Milles will rise

1376
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:30,386
from the land
across the roadway.

1377
01:32:30,619 --> 01:32:32,054
They'll attack head-on

1378
01:32:32,488 --> 01:32:34,821
in a great and terrible
multitude.

1379
01:32:34,823 --> 01:32:37,092
The eclipse gives us
one advantage.

1380
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:38,894
It's not night or day.

1381
01:32:39,261 --> 01:32:42,330
So this time,
Merlin can fight beside us.

1382
01:32:43,766 --> 01:32:46,502
But the five of us won't stand
a chance on our own.

1383
01:32:47,002 --> 01:32:48,803
We need to raise an army.

1384
01:32:50,672 --> 01:32:53,206
I'm relying on you
three to set a good example.

1385
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:55,407
So when the entire school's
out in the playground

1386
01:32:55,409 --> 01:32:58,678
watching the eclipse,
everyone behaves themselves.

1387
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,813
Is that clear?

1388
01:32:59,815 --> 01:33:01,415
- Yes, Miss.
- Okay, Miss.

1389
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:04,954
Why are all these
children walking towards us?

1390
01:33:09,891 --> 01:33:13,395
And what on earth
are you children doing,

1391
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:17,331
turning up to school
in the middle of the morning

1392
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,734
dressed like that?

1393
01:33:19,234 --> 01:33:21,268
Saving Britain
from eternal slavery

1394
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,439
by an ancient,
undead evil, Miss.

1395
01:33:29,077 --> 01:33:33,214
Break is over. Quickly
and quietly fall in line.

1396
01:33:36,385 --> 01:33:39,221
Get in line. Break is over.

1397
01:33:45,627 --> 01:33:48,964
Everyone, gather round.

1398
01:33:49,396 --> 01:33:50,533
Quickly now.

1399
01:33:52,734 --> 01:33:55,805
This boy has
a very important announcement.

1400
01:33:57,638 --> 01:34:00,008
My name is Alexander Elliot.

1401
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:04,446
A few days ago,
I found a sword in a stone.

1402
01:34:05,114 --> 01:34:07,915
Then I found out it wasn't
just any sword in a stone,

1403
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:10,352
it was the Sword
in the Stone...

1404
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:12,721
Excalibur.

1405
01:34:14,323 --> 01:34:18,426
I know, I know,
I know it sounds ridiculous,

1406
01:34:18,793 --> 01:34:21,530
but it's true,
and I can prove it.

1407
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:24,300
This boy, Mertin,

1408
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,334
is really the wizard, Merlin.

1409
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:29,271
And if you don't believe me,

1410
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:30,605
then just watch.

1411
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,522
How humiliating.

1412
01:34:48,789 --> 01:34:51,292
Quiet. Quiet. Listen.

1413
01:34:52,427 --> 01:34:55,163
This country is in danger.

1414
01:34:55,663 --> 01:34:57,565
A sorceress called Morgana

1415
01:34:57,999 --> 01:35:00,868
has been sleeping
under our soil for centuries,

1416
01:35:01,535 --> 01:35:06,341
waiting for her moment
to return and enslave us.

1417
01:35:06,675 --> 01:35:08,476
And that moment has come.

1418
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:12,147
In two hours,
there will be an eclipse.

1419
01:35:12,913 --> 01:35:15,782
Morgana and her army
of undead knights

1420
01:35:15,784 --> 01:35:17,286
will attack the school.

1421
01:35:17,985 --> 01:35:21,355
We need you
to help us defeat her.

1422
01:35:21,623 --> 01:35:25,427
All you have to do is kneel
and let Alex knight you.

1423
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:30,330
Everyone who does
gets a sword and armor.

1424
01:35:30,597 --> 01:35:32,066
This isn't a game.

1425
01:35:32,534 --> 01:35:34,302
This is 100% for real.

1426
01:35:34,869 --> 01:35:37,838
Flaming swords,
fire-breathing horses.

1427
01:35:38,105 --> 01:35:40,441
So, don't step up
unless you're ready.

1428
01:35:40,876 --> 01:35:43,412
Me and Bedders
used to hate Lance and Kaye.

1429
01:35:44,012 --> 01:35:47,382
And they hated us.
We were sworn enemies.

1430
01:35:47,882 --> 01:35:50,218
But now we know
that's how evil tricks you.

1431
01:35:51,253 --> 01:35:53,752
It turns people
against each other

1432
01:35:53,754 --> 01:35:55,489
to distract them from itself.

1433
01:35:56,123 --> 01:35:59,591
Because it knows
that if we fight together,

1434
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:01,596
it doesn't stand a chance.

1435
01:36:02,263 --> 01:36:04,298
So, who will stand
with us today?

1436
01:36:05,065 --> 01:36:07,733
Who will stand up
to save their friends,

1437
01:36:07,735 --> 01:36:10,439
their future, their country?

1438
01:36:11,105 --> 01:36:12,607
Who will join us?

1439
01:36:14,309 --> 01:36:17,111
Nah.

1440
01:36:18,145 --> 01:36:20,048
<i>Activa.</i>

1441
01:36:20,682 --> 01:36:22,117
And, by the way,

1442
01:36:22,484 --> 01:36:25,520
this is instead of
lessons today.

1443
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:36,529
Excuse me, Pam, forgive us
if we're speaking out of turn.

1444
01:36:36,531 --> 01:36:38,598
I thought we were taking an
hour out to watch the eclipse.

1445
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,901
No one said anything about any
kind of historical reenactment.

1446
01:36:40,903 --> 01:36:42,301
My Year 11's are meant to be
off-timetable

1447
01:36:42,303 --> 01:36:44,804
for intensive revision.

1448
01:36:44,806 --> 01:36:46,104
I just had all of these
made up.

1449
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:47,376
Ladies and gentlemen!

1450
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:49,511
If I could have your attention
for a moment...

1451
01:36:56,784 --> 01:36:57,850
What's your name?

1452
01:36:57,852 --> 01:36:58,753
Hector.

1453
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:02,455
I knight thee, Sir Hector.

1454
01:37:02,457 --> 01:37:03,258
Take a shield.

1455
01:37:03,591 --> 01:37:05,694
Take a shield,
move on to the next table.

1456
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,170
Take a sword. Good.

1457
01:37:17,172 --> 01:37:18,507
Take a sword.

1458
01:37:19,807 --> 01:37:22,376
Set the barricades!
Lay the ropes!

1459
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,577
Go, go, go!

1460
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:26,411
Tie two ropes
on each vaulting horse.

1461
01:37:26,413 --> 01:37:29,684
Quick as you can,
then get ready to hoist!

1462
01:37:36,525 --> 01:37:38,425
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,

1463
01:37:38,427 --> 01:37:41,027
I don't suppose
I could possibly borrow

1464
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:42,698
everyone's car keys, could I?

1465
01:37:44,466 --> 01:37:46,733
Come on.
First car on the left.

1466
01:37:46,735 --> 01:37:48,100
You guys, first on the right.

1467
01:37:48,102 --> 01:37:49,770
Keep it moving. Well done.

1468
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,507
One set of keys each. Go.

1469
01:37:53,275 --> 01:37:54,209
Good.

1470
01:37:54,409 --> 01:37:57,210
Go. Go.

1471
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:58,547
And one!

1472
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,145
Left block.

1473
01:38:00,147 --> 01:38:01,583
And two!

1474
01:38:01,982 --> 01:38:03,116
Upper block.

1475
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:04,453
And three!

1476
01:38:04,852 --> 01:38:06,051
Right block.

1477
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:07,286
And four!

1478
01:38:07,288 --> 01:38:08,688
Legs wide.

1479
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:09,889
And five!

1480
01:38:09,891 --> 01:38:11,460
Use the weight
of the sword.

1481
01:38:13,026 --> 01:38:15,830
You must lure her.
Trap her.

1482
01:38:16,131 --> 01:38:18,232
Give me time to open a portal.

1483
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:20,168
Create a vortex.

1484
01:38:20,735 --> 01:38:24,705
Then you must destroy her
so that she can never return.

1485
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:28,077
It won't be easy, Alex.

1486
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:30,145
We can do it, Merlin.

1487
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:32,381
We don't have any choice.

1488
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,415
We have to do it.

1489
01:40:04,472 --> 01:40:06,507
All battalions, stand by.

1490
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,707
This is it. Good luck.

1491
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:10,876
- Prepare for battle!
- Prepare for battle!

1492
01:40:23,324 --> 01:40:25,057
They're through the gates.

1493
01:40:25,059 --> 01:40:27,195
Wait for it. Wait for it.

1494
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:29,497
Now! Go! Go! Go!

1495
01:40:29,864 --> 01:40:30,830
Go! Go!

1496
01:40:43,444 --> 01:40:45,577
Reverse! Reset!
Reposition!

1497
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:47,716
I've never driven
backwards before!

1498
01:40:50,217 --> 01:40:51,283
No!

1499
01:40:51,285 --> 01:40:52,654
Damn!

1500
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:58,427
Warn Bedders' battalion!
They're coming through!

1501
01:41:08,936 --> 01:41:11,506
- Pull! Pull!
- Pull!

1502
01:41:14,775 --> 01:41:16,642
Pull!

1503
01:41:16,644 --> 01:41:18,143
Charge!

1504
01:41:36,431 --> 01:41:38,967
Drop the horses! One!

1505
01:41:41,503 --> 01:41:42,437
Two!

1506
01:41:43,605 --> 01:41:44,573
Three!

1507
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:47,776
Four!

1508
01:41:50,512 --> 01:41:51,777
Charge!

1509
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,051
We need more men!

1510
01:42:52,406 --> 01:42:53,872
Get back!

1511
01:42:53,874 --> 01:42:56,408
- Hold the line!
- Retreat!

1512
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:58,643
Sir Lance and Lady Kaye
are overwhelmed!

1513
01:42:58,645 --> 01:43:01,613
Sir Beddersvere fights
man-to-man!

1514
01:43:03,717 --> 01:43:06,118
Sound the retreat! Fall back!

1515
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,420
Meet on the roof!

1516
01:43:07,422 --> 01:43:09,220
There's too many of them.

1517
01:43:12,092 --> 01:43:14,993
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Retreat now! Now!

1518
01:43:21,802 --> 01:43:22,803
Move!

1519
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:24,373
Quicker!

1520
01:43:24,838 --> 01:43:25,841
Come on!

1521
01:43:30,177 --> 01:43:32,310
- Barricade!
- Barricade!

1522
01:43:32,312 --> 01:43:34,712
- Barricade!
- Barricade!

1523
01:43:34,714 --> 01:43:36,849
- Barricade!
- Barricade!

1524
01:43:36,851 --> 01:43:38,854
- Build the barricade!
- Quickly!

1525
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:42,156
Quickly!

1526
01:43:42,356 --> 01:43:43,822
My battalion,
to the far corner.

1527
01:43:43,824 --> 01:43:46,425
- Come on. Take cover.
- Come on. Take cover.

1528
01:43:48,428 --> 01:43:51,565
Keep moving!
Good work! Go!

1529
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,700
- Quickly.
- Over there! Run!

1530
01:43:54,702 --> 01:43:56,471
Good work! Go!

1531
01:44:00,842 --> 01:44:02,273
There's thousands
of them.

1532
01:44:02,275 --> 01:44:03,710
Where's Morgana?

1533
01:44:03,712 --> 01:44:05,478
<i>The barricade
won't hold for long.</i>

1534
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:08,014
Maybe she's not coming.
Maybe it's over.

1535
01:44:09,818 --> 01:44:10,851
Where's Merlin?

1536
01:44:14,422 --> 01:44:16,458
Hello, Merlin.

1537
01:44:19,561 --> 01:44:21,763
You've hardly aged a day.

1538
01:44:28,436 --> 01:44:30,605
An army of children.

1539
01:44:31,638 --> 01:44:33,740
Did you think I might
take pity on them?

1540
01:44:34,408 --> 01:44:39,580
After all these years,
this is your plan?

1541
01:44:45,186 --> 01:44:46,921
There you are.

1542
01:44:47,122 --> 01:44:49,089
You have no pity.

1543
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:52,390
These children have
more goodness and nobility

1544
01:44:52,392 --> 01:44:54,462
than you can ever comprehend.

1545
01:44:54,895 --> 01:44:56,196
But, Merlin,

1546
01:44:56,730 --> 01:45:01,168
I have seen them
in their heated hovels,

1547
01:45:01,836 --> 01:45:04,972
with their toys
and trivialities,

1548
01:45:05,673 --> 01:45:08,208
with their ignorance
of nature,

1549
01:45:08,441 --> 01:45:10,177
of magic.

1550
01:45:10,712 --> 01:45:14,549
Do you think these little rats
are worthy of this land?

1551
01:45:14,815 --> 01:45:18,651
Of that sword?
Of my inheritance?

1552
01:45:18,653 --> 01:45:20,088
- Merlin.
- Merlin!

1553
01:45:21,422 --> 01:45:22,591
Yes, I do.

1554
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:26,661
You and I are history,
Morgana.

1555
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:30,198
The future is theirs,
not ours.

1556
01:45:31,865 --> 01:45:35,067
They have no future.

1557
01:45:48,415 --> 01:45:49,848
Let's go!
Ready your ropes!

1558
01:45:57,124 --> 01:45:59,694
Alex, don't die.

1559
01:46:00,095 --> 01:46:01,260
I'll do my best.

1560
01:46:07,769 --> 01:46:09,971
Hey, come and get it!

1561
01:46:11,204 --> 01:46:13,574
Over here! Come and get it!

1562
01:46:16,177 --> 01:46:17,712
Bedders! Now!

1563
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,572
Help me!

1564
01:46:47,574 --> 01:46:48,573
Go!

1565
01:46:51,779 --> 01:46:53,949
Pull it!

1566
01:46:54,981 --> 01:46:57,250
Pull! Pull!

1567
01:47:01,623 --> 01:47:02,824
Take cover!

1568
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:07,227
Come on!

1569
01:47:09,963 --> 01:47:10,966
Hey!

1570
01:47:19,473 --> 01:47:20,374
Hey!

1571
01:47:27,382 --> 01:47:28,383
Hey!

1572
01:47:32,653 --> 01:47:34,387
Lance, Kaye, now!

1573
01:47:34,821 --> 01:47:37,324
Choke her.
Stop her breathing fire!

1574
01:47:39,827 --> 01:47:41,997
- Ready?
- Do it!

1575
01:47:57,610 --> 01:47:59,310
Grab the rope!
Back me up!

1576
01:47:59,312 --> 01:48:00,912
Hurry! Come on!

1577
01:48:00,914 --> 01:48:04,685
Pull! Harder! Pull!

1578
01:48:07,922 --> 01:48:11,226
Don't let go!

1579
01:48:15,596 --> 01:48:18,531
Merlin, we've got her!
We're ready!

1580
01:48:21,267 --> 01:48:22,404
Merlin!

1581
01:48:27,475 --> 01:48:29,744
Someone throw me a jacket!

1582
01:48:30,244 --> 01:48:31,680
Get him a jacket!

1583
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:39,020
Merlin, speak to me!
Are you okay?

1584
01:48:42,323 --> 01:48:43,388
I'm sorry.

1585
01:48:44,825 --> 01:48:46,358
I've nothing left.

1586
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,695
I've failed you.

1587
01:48:48,995 --> 01:48:51,266
No, not yet, you haven't.

1588
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:53,934
Magic potion. Quickly.

1589
01:48:56,369 --> 01:48:59,471
Ice cream, cherryade
and chicken nuggets...

1590
01:48:59,473 --> 01:49:00,572
liquidized.

1591
01:49:10,851 --> 01:49:13,751
Alex, we can't hold her
for much longer!

1592
01:51:08,235 --> 01:51:10,100
So great!
You were so good.

1593
01:51:10,102 --> 01:51:12,103
Well done! Well done!

1594
01:51:12,105 --> 01:51:14,740
Congratulations,
we did it. You did it.

1595
01:51:14,742 --> 01:51:18,344
Well fought. We did it.
Well done!

1596
01:51:18,346 --> 01:51:19,911
- Bravo! Congratulations.
- Yes!

1597
01:51:19,913 --> 01:51:22,246
Heroes! Heroes all!

1598
01:51:22,248 --> 01:51:24,716
- Yes, yes! Heroes!
- Woo!

1599
01:51:24,718 --> 01:51:28,152
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1600
01:51:28,154 --> 01:51:30,290
Well done! Well fought!

1601
01:51:31,257 --> 01:51:32,392
Well fought!

1602
01:51:38,266 --> 01:51:41,302
I've seen
many great battles in my time.

1603
01:51:42,035 --> 01:51:44,437
The siege of Guinnion Fort,

1604
01:51:44,704 --> 01:51:47,341
the Saxons halted
on Badon Hill.

1605
01:51:47,941 --> 01:51:51,343
But believe me,
none were fought as bravely

1606
01:51:51,345 --> 01:51:55,346
as yours against Morgana
and the Mortes Milles.

1607
01:51:55,348 --> 01:51:59,087
You have truly surpassed
my every expectation.

1608
01:51:59,486 --> 01:52:01,254
Merlin, we won the battle,

1609
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:04,322
but Britain's still the same
place it was before.

1610
01:52:04,324 --> 01:52:07,091
Yeah, how can we ever
change anything else?

1611
01:52:07,093 --> 01:52:10,828
And, even with the sword,
who's ever gonna listen to us?

1612
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:13,130
It's true. We're just kids.

1613
01:52:13,132 --> 01:52:15,936
That may be so.
Yet know this.

1614
01:52:16,637 --> 01:52:20,140
There is a wise, old soul
within every child.

1615
01:52:24,378 --> 01:52:27,247
And a foolish child
in every old soul.

1616
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:31,051
Perhaps you have
more battles yet to fight.

1617
01:52:31,418 --> 01:52:35,353
They may not be against demons
or undead knights,

1618
01:52:35,355 --> 01:52:37,724
or won with swords or armies.

1619
01:52:38,258 --> 01:52:41,462
But even if you do not
wield Excalibur,

1620
01:52:42,495 --> 01:52:45,266
you will still know
what it stands for...

1621
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,236
what you stand for.

1622
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:50,969
Sir Beddersvere,

1623
01:52:50,971 --> 01:52:53,906
I gave you the power
of metal duplication.

1624
01:52:53,908 --> 01:52:56,907
I was going to take
it away, but now,

1625
01:52:56,909 --> 01:52:59,345
I believe you can be
trusted with it.

1626
01:52:59,747 --> 01:53:02,182
Really? Seriously?

1627
01:53:04,083 --> 01:53:05,419
Thank you, Merlin!

1628
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:09,323
I promise I'll never use it
for anything but good.

1629
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:13,328
Sir Lance, Lady Kaye,

1630
01:53:14,829 --> 01:53:17,098
you are brave,
loyal and noble.

1631
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:20,165
You have learned
to fight for others,

1632
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:22,102
not just fight for yourselves.

1633
01:53:23,003 --> 01:53:25,973
You are truly Knights
of the Round Table.

1634
01:53:27,007 --> 01:53:28,209
Thank you, Merlin.

1635
01:53:30,511 --> 01:53:31,412
Thank you, Merlin.

1636
01:53:33,312 --> 01:53:36,715
Alexander, I borrowed
this book of yours,

1637
01:53:36,717 --> 01:53:38,586
made a few alterations.

1638
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:00,274
Thanks, Merlin.

1639
01:54:02,575 --> 01:54:05,546
A land is only as good
as its leaders.

1640
01:54:06,846 --> 01:54:09,684
And you will make
excellent leaders.

1641
