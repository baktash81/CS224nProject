1
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,036
-Good morning, Warden.
-Tom.

2
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,073
Is that Elwood Blues?

3
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,437
Yes, sir. Released yesterday.

4
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,513
Did you tell him about Jake?

5
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,996
No, sir. I thought you told him.

6
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,834
I'm sorry.

7
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,235
Listen...

8
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,393
...I work for a friend of yours.

9
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,510
Who's that?

10
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,075
Your old drummer, Willie.

11
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,154
I dance at his club.

12
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,954
He heard you were out
and asked me to get you.

13
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,310
He said he'd give you a job.

14
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,315
Matara, could you drop me off here?

15
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,071
What can I do for you?

16
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,956
Sir, how much would that full-sized...

17
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,310
...Ford police package run me?

18
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,391
Get yourself $500...

19
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,872
...and come back to see me.

20
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,638
Okay, sir.

21
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,271
That's a nice car.

22
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,838
I'll save it for you.

23
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,513
Thanks.

24
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,389
I wasn't sure you would come, Elwood.

25
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,150
A letter from you is like a command, sister.
You know that.

26
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,279
Actually, it's Mother Mary now.

27
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,916
That's a promotion, isn't it?

28
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,437
I was sorry to hear about Jake.

29
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,550
Yeah, well I guess
he's in a much better place.

30
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,472
Where is Curtis?

31
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,597
Curtis has gone on as well, Elwood.
I'm sorry.

32
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,429
So that's why he stopped writing me.

33
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,957
He was very upset
when the orphanage closed.

34
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,996
Curtis was the closest thing to a dad
Jake and I ever had.

35
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,232
He gave us the music.

36
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,352
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
Elwood.

37
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,040
We must go on and fight the good fight.

38
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,157
The orphanage is gone, Jake's gone,
Curtis is gone.

39
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,676
I got no brother, no roots, no life.
I got nothing!

40
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,479
Young man...

41
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,270
...you were not taught and raised by me...

42
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,830
...to fold at the slightest whiff
of adverse circumstances.

43
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,670
Now quit your silly moping,
pull yourself together and snap out of it!

44
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,954
But--

45
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,912
But nothing! Wise up!
Turn your heart to the Creator.

46
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,912
You are so quick to despair.

47
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,754
You are not the only person in the world
who has had tragedy in their lives.

48
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,308
Did you know that Curtis had a son?

49
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,874
Curtis had a son?

50
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,635
Before Curtis came to us
at St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud...

51
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,232
...he had a musical group
that toured juke joints in the Midwest.

52
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,359
In one town, Curtis had an affair
with a married woman.

53
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,233
Go, Curtis.

54
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,839
I mean, that's terrible.

55
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,912
That's what I thought you meant.

56
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,312
The woman became pregnant
and decided to stay with her husband...

57
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,836
...never telling him
that the boy child wasn't his.

58
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,632
Curtis was devastated.

59
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,990
He came to us as a custodian...

60
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,551
...and spent the rest of his life
caring for little orphans like you.

61
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,750
That's a beautiful story.

62
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,879
Wait a minute. If Curtis had a son...

63
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,838
...that guy would be kind of like
my stepbrother.

64
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,193
I have a family.

65
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,198
Curtis stayed in touch
with the boy's mother.

66
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,555
He sent his paycheck every week.

67
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,631
Where is this boy now?

68
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,190
He's a grown man now,
and doing quite well.

69
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,669
He's in the city.
His name is Cabel Chamberlain.

70
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,110
Cabel Chamberlain.

71
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,237
He knows nothing about Curtis.
You are not to tell him.

72
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,033
I wouldn't say anything.

73
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,595
Do you know anything about mentoring?

74
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,833
No. What about it?

75
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,150
I'd like you to meet someone.

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,394
Sister, would you send Buster in here?

77
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,039
Wait a minute.

78
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,235
Thank you.

79
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,349
Come in, Buster, and sit down.

80
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,637
Elwood, say hello to Buster.

81
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,434
Hi. How ya doin'?

82
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,710
Buster, say hello to Elwood.

83
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,308
Hi. How ya doin'?

84
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,111
The kid's a wiseass.

85
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,634
Shit!

86
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,635
What did you say?

87
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,712
I said, what a sweet kid.

88
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,392
That's more like it.
Now, here's my proposal.

89
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,596
Buster is a ward of the State.

90
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,797
Due to lack of space, the archdiocese...

91
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,792
...is housing homeless children
here at the hospital.

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,195
What's that got to do with me?

93
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,272
I thought you could come
and spend time with Buster.

94
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,439
Why don't you take Buster to the library?

95
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,718
You know, I've been jacked around--

96
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,959
The library. No problem.

97
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,950
See you in two hours, boys.

98
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,079
Here's the deal. You wait here.
I'll come back for you with the car.

99
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,914
Do you have a car?

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,992
I'm working on it.

101
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,797
Chicago. Cabel Chamberlain.

102
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,392
Thanks for the ride.

103
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,718
Kid, are you stalking me?

104
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,630
What are you, fifteen? Seventeen?

105
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,395
I'm ten.

106
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,194
Ten?

107
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,353
I know what that's like.

108
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,989
You're lonely, searching for a place in life.

109
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,678
Don't blow it like I did.

110
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,834
Stay away from drugs, gangs, cyber porn
and you could be President some day.

111
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,072
But I don't want to be President.

112
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,075
I'm busy. I got kind of a brother in there.
He must be in trouble.

113
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,279
Besides, you don't want to hang around
with some over-forty recidivist.

114
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,313
Now scram.

115
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,677
A Mr. Elwood J. Blues is here to see you.

116
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,154
Yes, sir.

117
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,313
Commander Chamberlain's office
is on the 12th floor. He's expecting you.

118
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,118
"Commander" Chamberlain?

119
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,710
How can I help you, Mr....

120
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,310
Blues. Elwood J. Blues.

121
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,157
Could you take off your hat
and glasses in my office?

122
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,909
Okay, you can put your glasses back on.

123
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,955
What exactly is the nature
of your visit here, Mr. Blues?

124
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,598
Well, it's like this.

125
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,434
I used to be in a band called
The Blues Brothers.

126
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,230
So?

127
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,517
With a partner whose name was
Jake Blues.

128
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,269
Go on.

129
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,275
And you are our long-lost brother.

130
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,759
Mr. Blues...

131
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,318
...I am an only child.

132
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,758
But your real father
was like a real father to me, too.

133
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,349
-My real father?
-Yeah, Curtis.

134
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,429
Have you noticed
that I am African-American?

135
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,870
That's okay. So was Curtis.

136
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,670
See, your mother and Curtis had an affair...

137
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,990
...which produced a little boy. That's you.

138
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,514
My father...

139
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,918
...passed away 14 years ago.

140
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,192
He was a full-bird colonel
in the U.S. Air Force.

141
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,269
My mother...

142
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,149
...now lives in Phoenix, Arizona
and a more...

143
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,990
...honorable, sweet-tempered
and goodly woman does not exist.

144
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,554
I'm not making any moral judgments.

145
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,074
But one can project
what might have happened.

146
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,072
Your mom, young...

147
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,432
...her husband in the military.
Often away from home...

148
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,953
...which may have pushed her
to reach out...

149
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,231
-...stray from the nest.
-That's enough.

150
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,639
Just a minute...

151
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,154
...please.

152
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,155
Hi, Ma. It's me, Cab.

153
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,512
Listen, I have a...

154
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,152
...gentleman here who's telling me
some story about a man named Curtis.

155
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,869
What?

156
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,995
Right.

157
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,349
So, what precisely do you want from me?

158
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,353
Seeing as we're kind of stepbrothers...

159
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,431
...I thought you could help me out.

160
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,790
How?

161
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,791
I need $500 for this car.

162
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,835
I thought maybe you could loan me
the money. Or--

163
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,353
Or what?

164
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,870
I want to put the band back together.

165
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,518
You could join us.

166
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,874
I am a commander...

167
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,796
...in the lllinois State Police.

168
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,632
I enjoy my job.

169
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,360
You waltz in here...

170
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,311
...telling me that I have a dead...

171
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,395
...white criminal brother,
who was in a band, which...

172
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,870
...the last time they played anywhere
were charged with...

173
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,391
...grand larceny...

174
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,197
...reckless endangerment,
felonious motor vehicle assault...

175
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,592
...over 700 violations
of the Highway Traffic Act...

176
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,717
...and damages, both public and private...

177
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,031
...in excess of $24 million.

178
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,874
And you are asking me
if I want to join this band?

179
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,916
I could show you all the moves.

180
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,276
Get the hell out of my office, right now!

181
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,072
I thinkyou need a hug.

182
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,875
And don't ever come back here again!

183
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,756
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

184
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,391
He dropped this.

185
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,717
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

186
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,794
Four...

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,911
...five hundred dollars.

188
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,358
Thank you, sir.

189
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,513
This your boy?

190
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,474
He's....

191
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,154
I'm his associate.

192
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,631
Yeah, that's who he is.

193
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,996
Lucky you came today.
I'm selling the place tomorrow.

194
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,396
Why?

195
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,189
I'm going to New Orleans
to try out a new career.

196
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,559
Good luck, Mr. Gasperon.

197
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,711
Good luck to you, Mr. Blues.

198
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,839
Mother Mary, we've done two bed checks...

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,798
...searched the grounds
and we can't find him.

200
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,789
Who?

201
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,350
Buster. He's missing.

202
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,674
Elwood!

203
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,032
Have you seen my wallet?

204
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,032
It smells like dog shit in here.

205
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,112
Don't say "shit," kid.

206
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,111
You don't need that shit, kid.

207
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,834
Elwood.

208
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,949
It's me.

209
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,712
Matara.

210
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,915
Yeah, right.

211
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,315
Mack.

212
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,395
Look who's here. Elwood Blues.

213
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,915
From Willie's old band.

214
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,749
Is this your son?

215
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Well, he's....

216
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,349
I'm hungry.

217
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,958
Come on, let's get you something to eat.
Willie's in the office.

218
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,271
What would you say
to my putting the band back together?

219
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,872
I'd say I've got a good business here
and I'm not going back to jail.

220
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,350
You're saying you don't miss it?

221
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,233
That's right.

222
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,749
You know you miss the music.

223
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,279
No pharmaceutical could equal the rush
you get when the band grooves.

224
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,836
People are dancing and shouting.
The house is rocking.

225
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,795
Sir?

226
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,919
Yes, Elizondo?

227
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,553
Found your wallet.

228
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,919
Let's see...

229
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,510
...badge, license, credit cards.

230
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,711
Just the cash is missing. Where was it?

231
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,553
Turned in to lost-and-found
in a paper bag...

232
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,995
...with this note.

233
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,313
I want a felony theft warrant
put out on Elwood Blues.

234
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,158
I want this guy. Now.

235
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,277
What did he mean,
calling you his "little brother"?

236
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,269
Right away, sir.

237
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,593
Good evening, welcome to Willie's.

238
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,912
Illinois' most elegant establishment
for entertainment, erotica and ecdysia.

239
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,238
Now, four young women
currently studying medicine...

240
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,033
...and paleontology
at Northwestern University.

241
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,156
Tia, Sandrah, Devon and Carla.

242
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,276
Here they are, The Roommates!

243
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,473
The band, the girls and I,
want to do a song for you.

244
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,312
A little Mack Rice cover.

245
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,914
You married men...

246
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,152
...better stay tied up,
because it's cheaper to keep her.

247
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,395
"It's cheaper to keep her

248
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,477
"It's cheaper to keep her

249
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,479
"When your little girl makes you mad

250
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,072
"You get an attitude and pack your bag

251
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,072
"Five little children
that you're leaving behind

252
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,112
"You're gonna pay some alimony
or do some time

253
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,519
"It's cheaper to keep her

254
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,668
"Too much to leave that little girl

255
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,118
"It's cheaper, it's cheaper

256
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,909
"If you decide to roam

257
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,031
"And leave your happy home

258
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,588
"You got to pay the house note

259
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,672
"The child support, your insurance

260
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,955
"Alimony, mortgage one, mortgage two

261
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,913
"It's cheaper to keep her"

262
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,594
What was that?

263
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,037
Strong-arm shit.
Protection payment. You know.

264
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,194
This time it's Russians.
But if I pay them, they leave me alone.

265
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,509
That's not right.

266
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,713
No shit.

267
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,434
If I could only figure out
what Elwood's game is.

268
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,950
Why did he come to see you?

269
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,437
To borrow $500
and ask me to join his band.

270
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,951
Well, he got his $500.

271
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,636
What instrument do you play?

272
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,432
How about a big hand for our gorgeous,
professional lady dancers?

273
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,829
Where's Willie?

274
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,912
Visiting his ailing stepfather. Why?

275
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,429
The Russians are here to see him.

276
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,392
I'll handle it. Where's Buster?

277
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,398
In the office, sleeping.

278
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,153
Good evening, gentlemen.

279
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,630
Mr. Hall has been unavoidably detained.
He may be a trifle late.

280
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,438
May I buy you a drink?

281
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,035
Mack.

282
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,955
Got a minute?

283
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,950
Don't forget our deal now, Elwood.

284
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,757
You can stop worrying.
Those Russians won't be back.

285
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,994
Those guys are bad mothers, Elwood.
Serious shit. They kill people.

286
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,553
They kill people?

287
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,639
Try to understand.

288
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,673
Those goons are orphan remnants of
the post-perestroika Soviet secret police...

289
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,880
...who twisted the well-intentioned,
original Marxist-Leninist doctrine...

290
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,635
...using state security, which was
corrupted by Beria in the '30s.

291
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,439
Once a mass populace
is coerced into such behavior...

292
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,514
...a radical shift, like glasnost,
produces guys like...

293
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,718
...headless automata who continue
the brutish measures...

294
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,998
...to which their genes were programmed
since the fall of the Romanovs.

295
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,277
That's great. I feel much better.

296
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,470
"Stay away from Willie's.
Signed, the Masked Avenger."

297
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,394
Now, a very special treat, our own...

298
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,195
...bartender, Mack McTeer,
will perform for you tonight.

299
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,752
Now, come on.

300
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,754
Elwood.

301
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,594
What are you doing?

302
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,156
I'm sorry. I promised the guy.
It'll never happen again.

303
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,517
"I'm all alone and fancy-free

304
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,598
"But that ain't the way I want to be

305
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,357
"Now girls, get your game up tight

306
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,837
"We're gonna have
a wing-ding-doodle tonight

307
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,718
"For right now I'm lookin' for a fox

308
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,349
"I'm lookin' for a fox

309
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,388
"Tonight the sky's the limit

310
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,790
"I got some money and I'm gonna spend it

311
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,709
"It's Saturday night and I wanna play

312
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,353
"I'm gonna groove

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,036

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,953
"Not a brand new pinstripe suit of clothes

"Big wide polka-dot tie

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,836
"Wanna see somethin ' else here?

319
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,876
"I'm ripe and ready and I'm hot to trot

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,919

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,993

"I'm lookin' for a fox"

324
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,078
Mack, you know something?

325
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,750
You can sing, man.

326
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,635
Everyone please leave now!

327
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,269
-Where's Buster?
-I don't know.

328
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,675
Gas!

329
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,199
Come on! Hurry!

330
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,829
Elwood!

331
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,709
You okay?

332
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,153
The girls get out?

333
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,198
Yeah, everyone's fine.

334
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,911
Matara, thanks for everything.

335
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,679
Time to go.

336
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,871
They have automatic weapons.

337
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,871
Look in the glove compartment.

338
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,989
Carpet tacks.
They have guns and we have carpet tacks.

339
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,793
They're not carpet tacks.
They're dry-wall nails.

340
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,679
Roll down the window. Dump the nails.

341
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,279
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Mack.

342
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,033
What do you mean?

343
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,874
If not for those Russian gangsters
and you helping me...

344
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,879
...I wouldn't have seen you sing.
You're good.

345
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,109
Thank you, Elwood.

346
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,354
Since the Russians torched Willie's club,
he'll need a job.

347
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,069
You'll need a job. I'll need a job.

348
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,231
So, you'll join the band,
then we'll all have jobs.

349
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,992
-Follow me?
-Sure.

350
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,193
What band?

351
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,999
Lieutenant.

352
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,031
-Elizondo.
-Find anything?

353
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,310
No bodies, but lots of gunfire.

354
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,719
Find the club owner?

355
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,353
Not yet.

356
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,715
Wait.

357
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,312
You better see this.

358
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,796
Matt.

359
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,237
You finally sell that demonstrator?

360
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,717
Check this funky car coming in.
I got a weird vibe.

361
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,718
The suit's real neat,
but do I have to wear the hat?

362
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,110
These are unsophisticated men. They only
respond to fear and the draw of lucre.

363
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,749
We elicit this by using
iconographic symbols...

364
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,751
...and psychological intimidation.

365
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,478
The way we look together...

366
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,393
...presents a uniform image
of strength and organization.

367
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,670
Don't say anything.
Look mean. No smiling.

368
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,994
Good to see you.

369
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,636
Even though that last gig was a nightmare.

370
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,956
Boys, meet my new partner in the act,
Mighty Mack.

371
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,032
Mack, "Blue Lou" Marini,
Matt "Guitar" Murphy.

372
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,394
Mighty Mack.

373
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,993
So, what's this about?

374
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,432
Putting the band back together.

375
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,676
You can't mention that here.

376
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,878
She's back from lunch.

377
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,549
Elwood.

378
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,035
Ma'am.

379
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,238
Sorry to hear about Jake.

380
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,034
Thank you, ma'am.

381
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,435
Who's this?

382
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,550
My new partner, Mack McTeer.

383
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,875
Pleased to meet you.

384
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,469
Matt, can I speak to you privately?

385
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,755
Sure, baby.

386
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,475
When you got out of prison,
you said, "No more Blues Brothers."

387
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,113
Yes, I did.

388
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,320
We've built up a good business using
the cash from the sale of the coffee shop...

389
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,228
...to start this Mercedes dealership.
What's wrong with you?

390
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,993
And I keep your pathetic friend on...

391
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,232
...even though he hasn't sold a car
in over two years.

392
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,755
Yes, you have, and no, he hasn't.

393
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,592
You talk straight with me.

394
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,874
I always do.

395
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,554
And treat me with respect at all times.

396
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,715
I do, baby.

397
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,958
You know what I mean when I say respect?

398
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,471
"What you want, baby I got it

399
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,149
"What you need

400
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,117

"l deserve respect"

436
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,157
Listen, Matt. You ain't all of that, cat.

437
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,118
And Elwood, you ain't no good.

438
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,868
Matt, this is something
I really don't want you to do.

439
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,830
For heaven's sake, if this is what
you'll be like to live with, go ahead.

440
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,989
Thanks, baby.

441
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,434
Let's go.

442
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,954
Elwood...

443
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,229
...you boys,
please stay out of trouble this time.

444
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,198
Dunn and Cropper, WEXR.

445
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,359
Chicagoland talk radio.

446
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,715
-This is Dunn and Cropper.
-Cropper and Dunn.

447
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,792
On WEXR, 103.7 talk radio.

448
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,629
Today's topic: Automatic life terms
for three-time felony offenders.

449
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,279
Let us hear your opinion.

450
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,199
You're on the air.

451
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,115
I am not in favor
of this triple felony legislation.

452
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,150
Why?

453
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,028
I'm a recently released inmate,
starting a new life...

454
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,595
...but with a five-felony record--

455
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,830
I think I know that voice.

456
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,197
What chance do I have
if I make one more mistake?

457
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,432
One more time, I could go down for life.
It's not fair.

458
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,237
My question is, how can you goddamn...

459
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,555
...shit-spewing media sluts--

460
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,713
Thank you. Now a commercial.

461
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,030
Steve, that sounded a lot like--

462
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,469
Elwood J. Blues.

463
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,754
No place to run.

464
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,592
And no place to hide.

465
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,876
I know your trumpet player's
a funeral director now.

466
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,309
But cemeteries give me the creeps.

467
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,756
He'll be the most difficult. Follow my lead.

468
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,997
Lay to rest Nicholas Tsetsevkaya.

469
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,434
A young man cut down too soon...

470
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,918
...by violent enemies.

471
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,550
Will you get lost?
Do you know who these people are?

472
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,474
Who's he?

473
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,959
What's with the monkey?

474
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,918
That's my associate, Buster Blues.

475
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,600
This is Mighty Mack, my new lead singer.

476
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,511
So, that's what this is about?

477
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,757
Forget it. Goodbye.

478
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,909
Mr. Fabulous...

479
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,276
...when should we come back for the rings
and watch off the corpse?

480
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,393
And is the medical school buying his dick?

481
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,868
We're dead now.

482
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,030
Since I've been working for Ed
and Mr. Pickett, I haven't looked back.

483
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,712
These guys are amazing.

484
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,792
What do you want, Elwood?

485
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,476
I'm putting the band back together.

486
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,149
We need Murph on the keyboards.

487
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,475
I see.

488
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,790
I won't go without your say-so.

489
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,152
Murph says you're in publishing,
telephone sales and matrimonial services?

490
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,475
Yes, we are.

491
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,839
Just what is it that you do exactly?

492
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,910
I'm 18 years old. I'm blonde.

493
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,512
I'm 36-24-36, and my name is Bambi.

Charlie, take it easy. That's all in the past.

530
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,075
He hung up on me.
A lot of burnt bridges, Mr. Blues.

531
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,633
I know you can book us somewhere.
You're still the best.

532
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,712
Ever hear of Queen Moussette?

533
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,394
The Louisiana witch, Queen Moussette?

534
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,116
That's her. She has a "Battle of the Bands"
going on at her club.

535
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,352
Big cash prize. Your band wins,
I get 15 percent of the take.

536
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,353
I'll book you a couple of gigs
on the way to Louisiana.

537
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,472
Golly, thanks, Mr. Sline.

538
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,394
Let go of me.

539
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,675
Sorry.

540
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,077
One more thing. You'll have to audition
for Queen Moussette.

541
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,912
Don't tell the boys about this.

542
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,959
We'll call to find out where our first gig is.

543
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,832
Just be careful, Elwood.

544
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,073
Alan Rubin.

545
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,312
Mr. Fabulous.

546
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,993
Mr. Fabulous.

547
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,150
The Blues Brothers Band.

548
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,036
You're going to love them.
They're absolutely sensational.

549
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,118
Really sensational.
They're a great blues band.

550
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,553
Yeah, blues band.
No, blues, not bluegrass.

551
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,351
You don't want a blues band?

552
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,515
Bluegrass.

553
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,912
They're the Bluegrass Brothers.
They're wonderful.

554
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,719
They absolutely pulverize an audience.

555
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,874
You're going to call and thank me.
The Bluegrass Brothers.

556
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,358
Our first date is at the county fair...

557
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,870
...in Cynthiana, Kentucky...

558
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,313
...and then we have this mystery gig
in Louisiana.

559
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,714
Mystery gig?

560
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,315
Elwood, you got the keys to the trunk?

561
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,469
It's full.

562
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,240
I haven't played a county fair since '68.

563
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,590
Sounds like a lot of laughs.

564
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,237
We're back on the road again.

565
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,072
Who are you, Willie Nelson?

566
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,195
I'll ride with Elwood.

567
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,350
Go right ahead, Mr. Thrill-Seeker.

568
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,639
Excuse me, sir.

569
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,350
Didn't you used to be Elwood Blues?

570
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,835
Who's asking?

571
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,195
I've listened to your stuff since I was a kid.

572
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,713
Yeah, so?

573
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,628
My friends and I have a band.
We're rehearsing nearby.

574
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,396
It would be so cool, and mean so much
to me, if you'd come listen to us play.

575
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,516
Sure. Go get started
and I'll be there in a minute.

576
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,433
Great.

577
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,919
Let's highball!

578
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,273
Mr. Blues?

579
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,477
-It's been almost seven days, Mother Mary.
-We must call the police.

580
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,677
Kidnapping is a federal offence.

581
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,798
I suppose you're right.

582
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,997
We should call the police.

583
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,070
Sir.

584
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,512
We just received a call.
Elwood Blues has kidnapped a child.

585
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,749
Roachdale 31.

586
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,957
-Wait.
-I got a cheeseburger cooling, man.

587
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,875
Buster, I'm sorry,
you'll have to see a bad side of me.

588
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,030
Mack, your shaving cream.

589
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,550
So none of you are driving that Ford?

590
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,268
No.

591
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,469
And whose dry white toast is that?

592
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,310
Run for your lives!

593
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,351
My God, help us! Somebody help us!

594
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,439
He's having an attack!
It's puffball bacteria!

595
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,478
It's extremely contagious!

596
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,152
What in Sam Hill?

597
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,880
Run away! Oh, God!

598
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,598
It's puffball bacteria! It's contagious!

599
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,353
Save yourselves!

600
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,072
Save yourselves!

601
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,960
Save yourselves! Save yourselves!

602
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,639
Hot damn. That's quite a trick.

603
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,710
That white trash ex-con
invented criminally evasive driving.

604
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,792
He kidnapped a little--

605
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,239
Get after him!

606
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,190
Murph?

607
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,635
Go ahead.

608
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,672
See you at the gig.

609
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,830
Where is the gig?

610
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,876
County fairgrounds, off Route 107,
Cynthiana, Kentucky, 11 PM tomorrow.

611
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,709
See you there.

612
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,715
How will he get there
with all the cops after him?

613
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,634
Wait a minute.

614
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,198
Don't I know you boys from somewhere?

615
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,034
Check, please.

616
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,997
We have to get off this road.
They've called ahead by now.

617
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,278
Two miles down, get off this
and on County Road 245 to Mariah Hill.

618
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,669
That'll get us close to the State line.

619
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,718
We have to lose them first.

620
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,313
You passed the turn.

621
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,355
I know.

622
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,110
You're hoping they lost interest?

623
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,028
This is Agent Peters
and Agent Bowman, FBl.

624
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,513
Good to have you here.

625
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,514
Elwood Blues is a menace
to decent people.

626
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,068
We'll get him, sir. That's a promise.

627
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,514
Every lawman in two states
is on this border.

628
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,160
Let him try to get past this roadblock.

629
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,233
Roll up your windows.

630
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,196
How long can we stay down here?

631
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,630
How long can you hold your breath?

632
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,276
Am I right?

633
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,634
Yes, sir.

634
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,039
I said, am I right?

635
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,109
Yes, sir.

636
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,111
I can't hear you!

637
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,555
Yes, sir!

638
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,796
You may think we're just a group
of sorry son-bitches...

639
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,110
...out here jerking each other off.

640
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,236
Or you may just think
that we know something.

641
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,757
I'll tell you something else.

642
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,795
The federal government has a computer.

643
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,999
This computer is wired...

644
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,517
...to a computer in Jerusalem...

645
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,711
...and Moscow.

646
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,511
There's something in the river.

647
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,630
Where?

648
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,189
I saw something under the water, sir.

649
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,675
Son...

650
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,675
...it's okay to be nervous.

651
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,554
There are enough explosives in that boat...

652
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,399
...to blow up every post office
in the country.

653
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,713
But nobody knows we're here.
Nobody knows our plans.

654
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,592
You guys having a picnic?

655
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,030
Don't shoot! You might hit the boat!

656
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,914
What boat?

657
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,240
That's the international Jewish,
communist conspiracy in action, people.

658
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,558
One of their spy satellites
picked up our location.

659
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,709
Kill them!

660
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,516
-Did you hear something?
-Nope.

661
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,591
-You sure they'll come?
-They're booked here. They'll come.

662
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,236
More stunts coming up...

663
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,678
...and only 20 minutes
until the wonderful Bluegrass Brothers.

664
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,758
These will make us look
a lot more bluegrass.

665
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,915
I'll fake some fiddle on my keyboard.

666
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,394
We go on after the last car stunt.

667
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,198
How will Elwood, Mack and the kid...

668
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,557
...get to the stage
with all the police around?

669
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,918
I like the car this color.

670
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,515
It's temporary camouflage, that's all.

671
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,039
All right. Go on.

672
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,193
Lots of heat here.
Maybe we ought to skip this gig.

673
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,909
That would be unprofessional.
Park it somewhere dark.

674
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,475
Now...

675
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,120
...the Devil Drivers' star, Rick Avery...

676
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,230
...does the triple-ramp loop
through the ring of fire!

677
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,110
Now the county fair is proud to present
tonight's musical entertainment...

678
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,079
...the Kentucky Bluegrass Brothers!

679
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,231
What's with the hats and beards?

680
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,594
You look like ZZ Top.

681
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,638
Sline booked us in here
as a bluegrass band.

682
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,440
Thank you so much, and howdy.

683
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,671
Howdy!

684
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,636
Howdy.

685
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,312
Howdy!

686
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:46,237
Good to see your smiling faces.
We'd like to see you a little bit closer.

687
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,231
Come on down out of the stands.

688
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,311
Come close to the stage.

689
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,309
Bluegrass?

690
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,355
Riders.

691
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,988
Duck, mountain tempo in A minor.

692
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,519
"That old cowpoke went ridin' out
one dark and windy day

693
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,720
"Upon a ridge he rested
as he went along his way

694
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,315
"When all at once a mighty herd
of red-eyed cows he saw

695
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,676
"A plowin ' through the ragged skies

696
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,672
"And up a cloudy draw

697
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:55,153
"The ghost herd in the sky

698
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,631
"Their brands were still on fire
and their hooves were made of steel"

699
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,397
Excuse me. Step aside.

700
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,675
Take your men behind the stage.

701
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,032
"A bolt of fear went through 'em
as they thundered through the sky

702
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,715
"For they saw the riders comin' hard

703
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,236
"And they heard their mournful cry

704
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:30,276
"Ghost riders in the sky

705
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,476
"Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
their shirts all soaked with sweat

706
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,310
"They're ridin ' hard to catch that herd
but they ain 't caught 'em yet

707
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,995
"'Cause they got to ride forever
