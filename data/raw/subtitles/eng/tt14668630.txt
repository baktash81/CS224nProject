1
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,070
{\an8}Ten tiny typists
tripped through the tunnel.

2
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,072
{\an8}Ten tiny typists
tripped through the tunnel.

3
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,323
{\an8}Ten tiny typists...

4
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,868
{\an8}- You can't be in here.
- Compliments of the house. Enjoy it.

5
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,369
{\an8}- Sir.
- It's delicious.

6
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,081
{\an8}Tell him callbacks are next week
and he'll know when he knows.

7
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:21,999
{\an8}Okay.

8
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,671
<i>Okay,</i> Show Us What You Got.

9
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>Contestant 318, you are up next.</i>

10
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,259
He wasn't next.

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,720
{\an8}- Where's your number?
- I have no time to waste.

12
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,054
{\an8}Magical magic.

13
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,931
Wait a minute, man.

14
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,601
{\an8}No, no, no.

15
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,312
{\an8}Hector, we told you after last time,
no more.

16
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:48,108
That was just my song-and-dance routine.
My new act will blow your minds.

17
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:52,237
{\an8}Prepare yourself
for the Dance of a Thousand Pigeons.

18
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,948
Yes.

19
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,492
{\an8}That's enough.

20
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,161
Thank you.

21
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,246
Maybe...

22
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,540
{\an8}Maybe go back to singing.

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,792
Security.

24
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,466
Seriously, dude?

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,134
Ditch the birds.

26
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,553
Show them something
they've never seen before.

27
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,681
{\an8}Because whatever that was, ain't working.

28
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,855
{\an8}Hi, I'm looking for something...

29
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,064
{\an8}Something...

30
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,400
{\an8}Something unusual.

31
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,693
{\an8}But cute.

32
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,862
{\an8}Really, really cute.

33
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,196
Also affordable.

34
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,075
{\an8}That I can fit under my hat,

35
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,077
{\an8}while I am dancing.

36
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,539
{\an8}We got a special on bird-eating spiders.

37
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,834
{\an8}Okay, let's try this again.

38
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,169
{\an8}Boa constrictor.

39
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,129
Vampire bat.

40
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,131
Might have a lemur in the back.

41
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,345
A lemur.

42
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,105
<i>I like it like that</i>

43
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,029
<i>I like it like that</i>

44
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,323
<i>Like that, baby</i>

45
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,245
<i>Oh, I said I like it like that</i>

46
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,956
<i>I like it like that</i>

47
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,834
<i>Yeah, I like it like</i>

48
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,338
<i>Stomp your feet
If you think I'm neat</i>

49
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,925
<i>Clap your hands
If you want some more</i>

50
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,719
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

51
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,138
<i>Like it Like it</i>

52
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,139
<i>Like it like</i>

53
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,724
<i>I like it like that</i>

54
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,686
<i>Yeah, I really like it like that...</i>

55
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,940
A singing crocodile.

56
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,568
<i>Baby, I like it like that</i>

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,866
LYLE

58
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,409
"Lyle." Lyle.

59
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:57,130
Hector P. Valenti,
star of stage and screen, at your service.

60
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,615
My reptilian friend, welcome home.

61
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,200
We're family now.

62
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,202
Come.

63
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,588
Okay, let's go.

64
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,065
Come on, Lyle.

65
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,693
I know you don't talk, but you can sing.

66
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:37,189
<i>You can pack your bags
And start skipping town</i>

67
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,734
<i>Hang up that hat
When the show shuts down</i>

68
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,948
<i>But when the world says
You ain't quite world-renowned</i>

69
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,617
<i>Don't count yourself out yet</i>

70
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,496
<i>When you hit that lonely and lowest low</i>

71
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,541
<i>Well, up's the only way left to go</i>

72
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,544
<i>You're meant to reinvent the show</i>

73
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,338
<i>So ain't you glad we met?</i>

74
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,550
<i>Turn that dull and dusty solo</i>

75
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,469
<i>To a dazzling duet</i>

76
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,810
<i>Maybe we started pretty small</i>

77
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,478
<i>But take a look at us now</i>

78
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,397
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

79
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,191
<i>Suddenly standing 10 feet tall</i>

80
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,651
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

81
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,820
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

82
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,906
<i>Though we had no way
To stay afloat</i>

83
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,326
<i>We were scared they'd say
It was all she wrote</i>

84
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,665
<i>We're ending on a sky-high note
Somehow</i>

85
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,668
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

86
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,753
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

87
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,506
You already owe me for the last show.

88
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,799
Yes, but this one's special.

89
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,010
Then you pay me up-front. In cash.

90
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,262
Cash might be a problem.

91
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,057
But I have something far more valuable.

92
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,822
<i>When that perfect plan's
Going off the rails</i>

93
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,700
<i>A heap of trouble is on our tails</i>

94
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,870
<i>It's time to polish up those scales</i>

95
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,955
<i>And give it all you got</i>

96
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,874
<i>If you're out of step</i>

97
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,334
<i>If you're out of sync</i>

98
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,420
<i>And you care too much
What those critics think</i>

99
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,340
<i>Well, when you find your missing link</i>

100
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,759
<i>They don't get a second thought</i>

101
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,929
<i>'Cause in the center of the spotlight</i>

102
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,765
<i>We just might have found our spot</i>

103
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,392
<i>Trying our luck with every leap</i>

104
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,936
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

105
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,895
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

106
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,398
<i>The road could be steady
Could be steep</i>

107
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,858
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

108
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,860
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

109
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,738
<i>Thought we might be sunk
Upon first glance</i>

110
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,450
<i>Well, who'd have thunk
That we had a chance?</i>

111
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:58,997
<i>And life could be
A song and dance somehow</i>

112
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,791
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

113
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,418
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

114
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,844
Thirty seconds to curtain.

115
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,304
Got a full house out there. Break a leg.

116
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,766
<i>So even when you're terrified</i>

117
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,353
<i>Just smile a smile a mile wide</i>

118
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,273
<i>'Cause, bud, when you and I collide</i>

119
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,233
<i>Standing side by side</i>

120
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:32,322
<i>We're gonna take a great big bow</i>

121
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:37,953
<i>Won't you take a look at us now</i>

122
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,959
<i>Give us a spotlight and a crowd</i>

123
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,003
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

124
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,631
<i>Ready to sing our song out loud</i>

125
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,550
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

126
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,677
Lyle.

127
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,852
Lyle.

128
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,769
Lyle, sing.

129
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,563
Sing, Lyle.

130
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,480
Please.

131
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,445
<i>Won't you take a look at us</i>

132
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,823
<i>Take a look at us</i>

133
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,826
<i>Take a look at us</i>

134
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:44,770
Drop the curtain.

135
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,438
Come on.

136
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,176
What's that look for?

137
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,805
We've had a minor setback, nothing more.

138
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,265
Yes.

139
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,352
I'll go on the road for a bit,
and make some cash.

140
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,730
Here, take this.

141
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,109
It's got every song you'll ever need.

142
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,902
The best companion there is.

143
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,114
Okay.

144
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,556
Okay, I'll be back
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

145
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:07,936
And remember, if anyone asks,
tell them you are stuffed.

146
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,773
Okay.

147
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,639
- You got it?
- Yeah, I'm good.

148
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,518
- Couple more.
- Straight to the living room, brother.

149
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,230
Are we actually gonna be living here?

150
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,982
I think we are.

151
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,901
This is a really bad idea.

152
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,947
Do you realize Manhattan crime statistics
have seen a year-on-year increase

153
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,490
of over 18 percent?

154
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,868
Most people move out of the city
when they have kids, not into it.

155
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,662
Ready?

156
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,792
And you must be the Primms.

157
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,546
I am so pleased to meet you.
I'm Carol from Liberty Day School.

158
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,297
We're so excited to be here.

159
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,216
Your new Math Department chair.

160
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,926
We are very pleased to have you.

161
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,137
If you can just sign these
when you get the chance.

162
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,557
Oh, and this is our son Josh.

163
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,519
Plus we haven't even talked about
the widespread use of lead paint.

164
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,938
- New city. Little nervous.
- Sure.

165
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,567
Oh, can I tell you
how much of a fan I am of your cookbooks?

166
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,152
- Right?
- I can't wait to see what you do next.

167
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,573
You know, I'm actually
scaling it back a bit work-wise,

168
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,867
so I could spend more time with Josh.

169
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,829
And this is Mr. Grumps,
your downstairs neighbor.

170
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:49,913
Hey, how's it going?

171
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:54,293
The local housing administration has
established strict noise abatement rules.

172
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,671
- Make sure you read them.
- Yeah, of course.

173
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,966
- We certainly will, won't we, darling?
- Of course.

174
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,719
That is the most beautiful cat
I've ever seen.

175
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,513
Loretta is not a cat.

176
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,808
She's a Silver Shaded Persian
with an extremely delicate constitution.

177
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,269
Do not feed her
or let her out of the building.

178
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,730
Why don't we go upstairs? Yeah, come on.

179
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,192
I'll be watching them.
My lawyers will be watching them too.

180
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,820
One foot out of place, and they'll be out,
and you'll be forced to sell.

181
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:22,738
Okay?

182
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,489
I'd say his bark's worse than his bite,

183
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,117
but to be honest,
his bite's pretty unpleasant too.

184
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,828
Amazing cat, though. Can we have a pet?

185
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,872
Josh, allergies.

186
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,956
I know.

187
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,171
FYI, there's a few leftovers
from a previous owner in the attic.

188
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,839
Hopefully they won't get in your way.

189
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,508
Welcome home.

190
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,263
Babe, can I put this here?

191
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,181
You hate it.

192
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,098
No.

193
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,435
New York City.

194
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,064
- Did we just move here?
- I think we did.

195
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,902
You think Josh is gonna be okay?

196
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,738
Are you kidding me?
He's got his own floor up there.

197
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,949
He's probably having the time of his life.

198
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,704
What was that?

199
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,206
<i>That is an ambulance.</i>

200
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,168
What was that?

201
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,711
<i>That was a car tire.</i>

202
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,715
What was that?

203
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,262
<i>I have no idea what that was.</i>

204
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,040
"This is my crocodile.
Please, take good care of him.

205
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,126
Cordially yours, Hector P. Valenti."

206
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:44,755
"Lyle."

207
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,779
Tofu kale breakfast bowl.

208
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,406
Swiss chard chickpea scramble.

209
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,535
- Vegan turmeric latte.
- I thought it was in...

210
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,162
Three different recipes
from three different books.

211
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,372
It's perfect.

212
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,750
Oh, honey,
this looks amazing, and healthy.

213
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,627
But I gotta go. I can't be late.
Where's Josh?

214
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,255
I'm taking Josh, remember?

215
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,964
Right.

216
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:28,966
Grab something.

217
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,885
Have you seen my glasses?

218
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:34,888
- Thank you.
- Hey.

219
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,014
Yeah?

220
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,767
You got this, okay?
They're lucky to have you.

221
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,936
I'm lucky to have you.

222
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,481
- Don't forget to sign up for wrestling.
- Okay.

223
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,985
- We gotta go.
- Josh, there's time for breakfast.

224
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,655
No, it's an 11-minute ride on the subway
from East 86th to West Farms Square,

225
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,783
plus a four-minute walk at this end
and a seven-minute walk at the other.

226
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,326
Assuming everything goes right.

227
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:02,291
Keep up, Mom. All the way down to the end.
Then we just cross this little avenue.

228
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,226
<i>This is 86th Street Station.</i>

229
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:25,731
Excuse me.

230
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,567
- Watch it.
- Wrong side, kid.

231
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,484
Excuse me.

232
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,153
Move, move.

233
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,754
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

234
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,219
Don't worry, you got this.

235
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,845
"You got this."

236
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,315
Seriously?

237
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,983
What are you doing?

238
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,903
- Do you not see us filming here?
- Come on, man.

239
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,113
- Do you mind?
- Dude, are you serious?

240
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,573
He's literally filming.

241
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,575
Let's go, guys.

242
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,286
Watch it on Sweep
like everyone else, pumpkin.

243
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,788
- Whatever.
- Weirdo.

244
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,888
Featherweights, you're up.

245
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,683
And wrestle.

246
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,184
Look for the single leg.

247
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,437
Come on.

248
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,406
<i>I'm Trudy, and I'm auditioning
for </i>Show Us What You Got<i>.</i>

249
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,681
Loretta.

250
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,434
Go ahead. That milk's for you.

251
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,188
Hey.

252
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,030
<i>Hey, remember me</i>

253
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,410
<i>Hey, remember me</i>

254
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,792
<i>You'll always remember me</i>

255
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,016
Okay. Stay close.

256
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,097
No!

257
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,730
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

258
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,169
Wait. No, you have to give her back.

259
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,785
Did you see that?

260
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,119
Dude, that was crazy.

261
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:33,497
Wait.

262
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,961
Hey, watch where you're going!

263
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,004
Hey!

264
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,231
Hey, kid.

265
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,361
You gonna give me that phone,
or am I gonna have to take it from you?

266
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,684
That was totally awesome.

267
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,366
Wait, you gotta show me how to get back.

268
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,546
Okay, last box.

269
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,467
Why did we even bring all this stuff?

270
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,888
Don't eat those. They're horrible.

271
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,641
What? You love these things.

272
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,269
You used to bake with cherries.
You made us put them on our wedding cake.

273
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,898
I know I did, but that was
before I found out what's in them.

274
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:27,027
They're full of hydrogenated palm oil,
and sugar, and corn syrup.

275
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,988
We wanna set a good example for Josh.
We should throw them out.

276
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,665
Outside in the garbage.

277
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,351
Hey.

278
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,062
Those are my trash cans,
not your trash cans.

279
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,105
Yours are in the back.

280
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,648
Oh, right. I'm so sorry.

281
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,649
Sorry is right.

282
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,778
Don't come around scattering
suburban mediocrity all over my trash.

283
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,822
- I didn't know.
- Someone's been feeding my cat.

284
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:12,906
I wanna know who.

285
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,993
Do you have any idea how dangerous
irritable bowel syndrome can be

286
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,703
in a cat as valuable as Loretta?

287
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,205
If I catch you,
or your wife, or your horrible son

288
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,750
so much as looking at Loretta,
my lawyers will be all over you.

289
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,335
Do I make myself clear?

290
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,837
Now, hold on a minute.

291
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,255
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

292
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,132
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Great.

293
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:34,011
Oh, please, use more of the hot water.
Help yourself.

294
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,389
- There's plenty to go around.
- What? Hot water?

295
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,690
Hey, hi.

296
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:47,858
You awake yet?

297
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:50,152
Here.

298
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:54,615
This is my Plus Four Strength card.

299
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,453
It's the most valuable card in my deck,
and I want you to have it.

300
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,250
Josh, where are you?

301
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,710
Okay, I gotta go.

302
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,754
And I'll be back after 3, okay?

303
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,216
An actual pet.

304
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,766
Hey, Josh, let's go.

305
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,267
Taking a shortcut.

306
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,228
What?

307
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,147
Josh.

308
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,109
Wait.

309
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:41,954
Josh?

310
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:42,871
This way.

311
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,173
Josh.

312
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,008
Hey.

313
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:03,851
Josh.

314
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:05,227
What's up?

315
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,819
Don't worry. I got this.

316
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,538
<i>I wanna stop</i>

317
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,957
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

318
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,959
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

319
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,837
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

320
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,005
<i>Oh, yes</i>

321
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:19,676
<i>How sweet it is to be loved by you</i>

322
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,597
<i>It's just like sugar sometimes</i>

323
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,308
<i>How sweet it is</i>

324
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,643
<i>Oh, your book.</i>

325
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,478
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

326
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,813
<i>That cake's gonna make you famous.</i>

327
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:40,822
<i>- That was a modest bite.
- Wait, wait. No, no, no.</i>

328
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,786
<i>How about another taste?</i>

329
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,663
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

330
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,498
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

331
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,292
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

332
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:31,915
Hey, Animal Planet.

333
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,168
What's with all the books?

334
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,380
You won't believe me.

335
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,386
I kind of have a...

336
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,972
pet crocodile.

337
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,058
Nobody has a pet crocodile.

338
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,143
Told you.

339
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,979
And absolutely nobody
has a pet crocodile in the city.

340
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,064
My dad had to do free dental work
for the mayor

341
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,901
just to get my pet rattlesnake
allowed in our building.

342
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:01,737
I saw you on Sweep.

343
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,947
I mean, like, not...

344
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,282
I didn't... It was...

345
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,374
You're kind of a weirdo, aren't you?

346
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:16,835
Yeah.

347
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,897
I've always approached our life
like one of my recipes.

348
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,609
When things get hard,
we stick with the ingredients that work.

349
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,112
But now it's all different,
and I still feel bad.

350
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:45,781
About what?

351
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,909
Josh growing up.

352
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,118
Oh, honey.

353
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,704
I know that I should feel happy, but...

354
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,543
I wish I just didn't feel so left out.

355
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:58,460
Hey.

356
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:03,006
You're a huge part of Josh's life,
and an amazing mother.

357
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:04,842
All right?

358
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,552
Hey.

359
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,429
We were lost until you found us.

360
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:43,839
What...?

361
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,690
You want me to...?

362
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:06,361
Okay, okay. See, the thing is
I've never dumpster dived before, so...

363
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,030
Okay.

364
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:09,406
Okay.

365
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:13,535
What...?

366
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,331
So gross.

367
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,175
Let's see.

368
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,427
You like noodles?

369
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,203
Oh, my God.

370
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,783
No, that's okay.

371
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,536
I have sort of quite a specific diet,

372
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,455
which is mostly Bagel Bites, so I'm...

373
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,793
I'm not sure if that's gonna taste...

374
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:53,092
Wow, that's actually amazing.

375
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,181
I've never had anything like that before.

376
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,309
Where are you from?

377
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,728
My mom's family is from Taiwan.

378
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,230
Well, she's actually my stepmom.

379
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,608
My mom died when I was 2.

380
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,403
My dad says I got her nose.

381
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,866
I can do this really,
like, crazy thing with my knuckles

382
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:20,037
where if I, like, go like that,
I can, like, crack them all.

383
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,081
Do you have knuckles?

384
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,584
What is that?

385
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,721
You don't talk, do you?

386
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:58,283
<i>In the shadow of the city</i>

387
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,870
<i>When the days have disappeared</i>

388
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,916
<i>Some might say it's sort of gritty</i>

389
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:10,254
<i>Full of faces to be feared</i>

390
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:14,633
<i>But there are wonders that are waiting</i>

391
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,553
<i>Underneath the midnight sky</i>

392
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:22,140
<i>We got the stars illuminating</i>

393
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:25,602
<i>It's a place for you and I</i>

394
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:30,232
<i>A little space for you and I</i>

395
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,986
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

396
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:37,656
<i>Where no one ever has to hide</i>

397
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,742
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

398
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,122
<i>You're sitting safe and starry-eyed</i>

399
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,666
<i>There is treasure you can find</i>

400
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,627
<i>In something someone left behind</i>

401
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,215
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

402
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,259
<i>It can stay this way</i>

403
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,137
<i>At least until the morning light</i>

404
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,778
<i>Through the dark
There's someone singing</i>

405
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:20,449
<i>Like an old familiar song</i>

406
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,660
<i>Like you fell
Into a melody that's bringing</i>

407
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:28,040
<i>You right here
Where you can belong</i>

408
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:32,461
<i>And there are wonders that are waiting</i>

409
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,589
<i>Underneath the midnight sky</i>

410
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:39,927
<i>And by the stars we're navigating</i>

411
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,598
<i>To a place for you and I</i>

412
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:47,935
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

413
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,813
<i>Where no one ever has to hide</i>

414
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,983
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

415
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,987
<i>You're sitting safe and starry-eyed</i>

416
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,032
<i>There is treasure you can find</i>

417
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:05,536
<i>In something someone left behind</i>

418
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:09,498
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

419
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,500
<i>It can stay this way</i>

420
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,169
<i>At least until the morning light</i>

421
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,511
<i>At the top of the world</i>

422
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:26,056
<i>The top of the world</i>

423
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,976
<i>The top of the world tonight</i>

424
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,149
Yeah!

425
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,916
Yes, it's an emergency.

426
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,795
The city must do something
about these double-wide strollers.

427
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:02,593
You know, just because somebody
made the mistake of having a second child

428
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:06,597
doesn't mean that
I should be forced off the sidewalk,

429
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,514
into the...

430
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:09,808
streets.

431
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,063
Mumsykins?

432
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,738
Have a great day.

433
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,031
You too, honey.

434
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,699
Josh, time to wake up.

435
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,617
Come on.

436
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,493
Josh?

437
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,543
All right, Josh, come on.

438
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:37,461
Let's go.

439
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:44,551
Mom, no, hold on.

440
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:45,636
Oh, my God.

441
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,553
He's safe.

442
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,646
No, Mom, it's okay.

443
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:00,817
<i>I wanna stop</i>

444
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,779
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

445
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,406
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

446
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,618
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

447
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,578
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

448
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:16,041
<i>How sweet it is to be loved by you</i>

449
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,126
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

450
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,257
<i>How sweet it is to be loved by you</i>

451
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,887
Mom, I swear, he's not dangerous.

452
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:32,224
- He's a crocodile.
- Okay, yes, crocodiles are dangerous.

453
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,643
They bite through bone
and have a taste for human flesh.

454
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,728
But he's not like that. He wears a scarf.

455
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,438
I have to tell your father.

456
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:41,441
- No, he'll have him taken away.
- I'll agree with him.

457
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:44,069
- No.
- <i>Thanks for calling. Leave a message.</i>

458
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:47,364
Lyle is a good crocodile.
He's just lonely, like I was.

459
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,533
And he cares about me.

460
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,369
Do you realize how different
things have been since I met him?

461
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,246
I made a friend.

462
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:57,124
Mom, I feel like I belong here,
because of Lyle.

463
00:40:57,207 --> 00:41:00,085
- Josh.
- You won't even see him. He's nocturnal.

464
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:01,378
And he can sing.

465
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,463
It's, like, how he talks.

466
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,842
Don't do anything
until I get home tonight.

467
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,803
That's all I'm asking. Please.

468
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,182
- <i>Hey.
</i>- Hey, honey, sorry.

469
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,266
Did you call?

470
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:17,436
I just...

471
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,149
wanted to wish you a great day.

472
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:24,443
<i>Thanks.</i>

473
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:27,487
I could use that.
These city kids have a lot of energy.

474
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,990
I'll see you at home. I love you.

475
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:33,619
I can't believe I just did that.

476
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,920
Everyone. Yeah, that's nice.
Can we sit down, though, please?

477
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,005
Hey, guys, let's not throw stuff.

478
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:48,300
Can we just settle down?
Just a little bit, okay?

479
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:29,591
<i>Just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove</i>

480
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:30,676
<i>Come on</i>

481
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:34,221
<i>When the people start to move</i>

482
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:39,726
<i>They can feel it all over</i>

483
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,896
<i>They can feel it all over</i>

484
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,274
<i>People, yeah</i>

485
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,277
<i>Over</i>

486
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:51,864
<i>Over</i>

487
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:52,948
<i>People...</i>

488
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:14,720
This isn't happening.
Crocodiles don't belong in houses.

489
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,485
<i>When you're cooking something up</i>

490
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,571
<i>And only trying the tried-and-true</i>

491
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:36,408
<i>You stick to the predictable you've known</i>

492
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,453
<i>Measure out the same amounts</i>

493
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,663
<i>Every teaspoon Every ounce</i>

494
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:45,459
<i>No surprises
When the rules are set in stone</i>

495
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,295
<i>But when the sugar hits the fan</i>

496
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,506
<i>You make a mess of your perfect plan</i>

497
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:54,134
<i>And you're facing the face
Of something strange and new</i>

498
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:57,221
<i>If it's not what you had prepared</i>

499
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:59,681
<i>In the scramble
You can't get scared</i>

500
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:04,144
<i>Let something wild
And wonderful break through</i>

501
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,231
<i>Start ripping up the recipe</i>

503
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:17,449

505

<i>Safe and simple By the book</i>

509

510
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,399
<i>But an unfamiliar spice</i>

511
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:52,818
<i>Might bring something extra nice</i>

512
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,570
<i>Something twice as good</i>

513
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:56,822

514
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,366

518
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,544
<i>You can pray that it goes away</i>

519
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:15,382

00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:31,792
{\an8}- Lyle?
- Lyle, all right.

535
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:38,882
Three cameras,
all mounted on the roof's perimeter.

536
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:41,802
No one's getting in or out
without you knowing about it.

537
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,887
Perfect. I know they're up to something.

538
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:48,851
No one's ever putting anything nasty
in Mummy's tummy ever again.

539
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,561
Are they, Mumsykins?

540
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,563
No. No.

541
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:53,939
N-O.

542
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,484
That's how we spell "no, no, no."

543
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:58,402
I'm just gonna...

544
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:00,112
Yeah.

545
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:15,419
Try that.

546
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:16,336
Really?

547
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:19,256
We should save some for Lyle.

548
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,465
Hey, guys.

549
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,468
Good morning, sweetheart.

550
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:24,386
Hey, Dad.

551
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,471
Pizza. For breakfast.

552
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:29,266
And where'd you get caviar?

553
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:31,560
Can I have a...?

554
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:32,561
- No.
- Sorry.

555
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:34,813
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- It's more like...

556
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,573
- See you.
- Let's not get any food...

557
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:50,078
Honey?

558
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:52,289
Yeah?

559
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,083
I've noticed that you've been...

560
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:59,338
happy recently.

561
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:01,882
Which is great.

562
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,384
And I wondered if that,

563
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:08,055
you know, hasn't been because of me.

564
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,224
I mean, is...?

565
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,019
Is there something I need to know?

566
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,437
Oh, sweet pea.

567
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,688
I mean, is there...

568
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:19,441
someone else?

569
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:23,779
Not exactly.

570
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:30,619
It's time to tell your father.

571
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:31,870
Tell me what?

572
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:42,172
- Go, go, go...
- Hey, Dad, wait, it's fine.

573
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,507
It's not what you think.

574
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,217
All right, this way.

575
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,301
Hide in here.

576
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:47,553
Dad, it's okay.

577
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:48,637
It is not okay.

578
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,973
There's a crocodile in the house.

579
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,101
That's what I thought too,
but he's not a normal crocodile.

580
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,811
What are you talking about?

581
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:57,980
Everybody, get out of here!

582
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,461
Follow me! Let's go!

583
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,510
There's a crocodile...

584
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,970
May I wish you good day, sir.

585
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,724
- Hector P. Valenti, at your service.
- What?

586
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,559
Where should I put my bags?

587
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,394
I'm not sure I...

588
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,479
Oh, dear. You didn't know I was coming?

589
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:40,898
No worries.

590
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:44,693
While you call the school authorities,
I'll make myself at home.

591
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,989
But you're... I'm...

592
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,782
Please, please, be my guest.

593
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,327
It's been a very long and difficult trip.

594
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,287
I'd hate to put my back out
in a moment of...

595
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,455
Oh, my.

596
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,124
Oh, Lyle.

597
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,835
Look at the size of you.

598
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:08,634
Lyle.

599
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:27,819
Yes.

600
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,352
I missed you too.

601
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:03,146
Lyle.

602
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,360
Oh, no, no, no.
We had no idea. Nobody told us anything.

603
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:12,239
Yeah.

604
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:15,367
Okay, yeah.

605
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,328
Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Bye.

606
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:19,788
What did they say?

607
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:22,207
Well, this was his family's brownstone,

608
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,502
but he somehow lost it
in some kind of a business deal.

609
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,797
He's figuring out some kind of new show,

610
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:34,219
and there's a clause that says somehow
he can stay here 15 days out of the year.

611
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:35,137
What?

612
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:38,682
This cannot be happening.

613
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:43,478
We have a crocodile, and now
David Copperfield, living in our attic.

614
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,607
This is definitely not okay.

615
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:50,194
And can you please stop drawing him?

616
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,697
It's weird.

617
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:02,164
Yes.

618
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:03,832
Yes.

619
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,361
I hate you.

620
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,782
I hate them so much.

621
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,964
<i>Express yourself</i>

622
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:56,969
<i>Express yourself</i>

623
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:01,223
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

624
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:03,559
If there's any breakfast, I'll take eggs.

625
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:07,145
Any way you wanna make them.
But not scrambled. Or fried.

626
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:08,063
Thank you.

627
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,776
<i>Whatever you do</i>

628
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:18,031
<i>Do it good</i>

629
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,911
<i>Whatever you do</i>

630
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,372
<i>Do, do, do, do, yeah</i>

631
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,500
<i>Express yourself</i>

632
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:30,794
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

633
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:33,463
<i>Oh, do it</i>

634
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:36,008
<i>Oh, do it</i>

635
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:39,469
<i>Do it to it, yeah</i>

636
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:44,266
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

637
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:50,272
Okay, family day.
What do you think, history museum?

638
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:52,274
- Go there?
- Sure.

639
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:54,234
There he is.

640
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:55,819
I'm just gonna...

641
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,158
So, Dad's not coming.

642
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,368
Dad needs to let off a little steam.

643
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,330
He doesn't like Hector, does he?

644
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:12,336
Oh, well,
Hector is a very colorful character.

645
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:16,006
I don't know about you, but I could
eat a horse if you spread butter on it.

646
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,592
- You're a Gators fan?
- Don't be ridiculous.

647
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,970
Smoke and mirrors, my friend.
Smoke and mirrors.

648
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:24,848
How else do you think Lyle can join us?

649
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,022
Shall we?

650
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:36,568
- Are you sure this is safe?
- Who wants to be safe?

651
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:40,447
No, "safe" is a repellent little word.
Expunge it from your mind.

652
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:42,324
We are here to live, yes?

653
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,493
And living is a dangerous business.

654
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:48,872
You're not worried that some people
might think he's a real crocodile?

655
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:52,584
Nothing could be of less importance
than what other people think.

656
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,002
Let people stare.

657
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:57,881
For once in their dreary lives,
they have something wonderful to look at.

658
00:54:57,965 --> 00:54:59,675
Look, look.

659
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,221
Here it is.

660
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,352
- Brain freeze.
- Another one.

661
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,029
Oh, no, you're going down!

662
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:23,323
- You're going down!
- Yeah!

663
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,660
- Let's go, Dawgs!
- What the...?

664
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:07,826
Oh, perfect timing.
You could be on my team.

665
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,870
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm okay.

666
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:13,040
I'm exhausted.
I'll go upstairs and take a shower.

667
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,751
Hector thinks the hot water might be out.

668
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:17,085
My bad.

669
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:20,881
Okay, right hand, red.

670
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:49,326
Lyle.

671
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:54,331
I was just checking the boiler.

672
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:57,543
Because it's cold, right?

673
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,925
Where'd you get that at?

674
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:08,470
Lyle, why would you do that?

675
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:43,964
Oh, no.

676
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:45,090
Not today.

677
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,361
One, two, three.

678
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:07,863
Yeah!

679
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:13,285
All-league champion!

680
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,746
I'm back, I'm back!

681
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,247
I still got it.

682
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:20,000
Twenty years. State champs, '99.

683
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:27,549
Come on, one more round.

684
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:36,308
Stay down.

685
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:49,446
Good morning.

686
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:57,913
Let's try that again.

687
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:00,832
Good morning, Mr. Primm.

688
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,297
Dad, you have to come see this.

689
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,883
- Is that a white rabbit?
- We can start the show of magic.

690
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,718
Can you please pass me those?

691
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:14,388
- This?
- Thank you. Yes, I need those.

692
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:15,681
Thank you very much.

693
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:20,060
Now, now that we have the bunny,
we can start our magic show.

694
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:22,855
Front row for you, sir.

695
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:27,401
Behold, the power of illusion.

696
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,862
Okay? Nothing here, nothing over there.

697
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:32,239
Follow the card carefully.

698
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:38,203
Magical magic.

699
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,298
Where are they? Here they are.

700
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:53,427
You have a nine, and you have a two.

701
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,271
Thank you. Thank you very much.

702
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,900
Hey, play us one of your songs.

703
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:11,153
- Yeah, play something.
- That would be amazing. Please?

704
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,005
<i>Maybe we started pretty small</i>

705
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:33,884
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

706
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,350
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

707
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:45,270
<i>Suddenly standing 10 feet tall</i>

708
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:46,772
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

709
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,107
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

710
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,818
<i>Though we had no way to stay afloat</i>

711
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:55,489
<i>We were scared
They'd say it was all she wrote</i>

712
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:58,742
<i>We're ending on a sky-high note</i>

713
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:01,161
<i>Somehow</i>

714
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,830
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

715
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:08,919
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

716
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:20,389
Don't you see what that means, Lyle?

717
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:23,058
That was an audience,

718
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:25,018
and you performed.

719
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:28,814
You performed, Lyle.

720
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:30,524
Yes.

721
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:33,819
Lyle. Lyle?

722
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:35,821
We can do it.

723
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,950
We can do it.
We can take our show on the road.

724
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:42,160
You and me, like we always planned.

725
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:50,335
<i>So I made a couple mistakes</i>

726
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:52,462
<i>Got a few things wrong</i>

727
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,256
<i>We can claw right back</i>

728
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:56,592
<i>To where we belong</i>

729
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:58,552
<i>It's just us two</i>

730
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:01,638
<i>And a soaring song</i>

731
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:04,683
<i>Redoing our debut</i>

732
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:09,062
<i>We get to finish what we started</i>

733
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:11,607
<i>It's a brand-new me and you</i>

734
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:14,943
<i>A brand-new me and you</i>

735
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:16,612
<i>Thought we might be sunk</i>

736
01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:18,322
<i>Upon first glance</i>

737
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:21,158
<i>Well, who'd have thunk?
Here's a second chance</i>

738
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:26,205
<i>And life could be
A song and dance somehow</i>

739
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:29,166
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

740
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,127
Let's go. Let's go.

741
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,426
Where are you going?
Why is he all dressed up?

742
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43,138
When the world sees
Lyle sing and dance, we're gonna be rich.

743
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:44,306
- Rich.
- What?

744
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:48,352
But he doesn't need money.
He needs a family and a home.

745
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,854
This is the business of show, Josh.

746
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:53,398
Because Lyle is not just a crocodile.

747
01:02:53,482 --> 01:02:54,483
He's a showman.

748
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,276
Bye.

749
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,529
Does he even want that?

750
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,447
Josh, tonight is our big night.

751
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:01,698
The night for what?

752
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:05,494
The preview
for potential investors in our new show.

753
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,914
Evangelyne will get us there just in time.

754
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:10,499
Who's Evangelyne?

755
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:14,461
Hector?

756
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,094
Wish us luck.

757
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:27,391
Take a look at us now.

758
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,376
Hey, how'd it go?

759
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:57,504
The stage can be a cruel mistress.

760
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:01,175
I thought Lyle had changed, but he hasn't.

761
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:02,551
He froze.

762
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,720
Stage fright.

763
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,599
He still won't sing for an audience.

764
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:35,083
Just so you know,

765
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:38,629
I don't care if you sing or not.

766
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:41,340
Either way, I think you're awesome.

767
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:59,024
Just give him a little time, okay?

768
01:04:59,816 --> 01:05:00,943
He's gonna be okay.

769
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:15,499
<i>Thought we would make a perfect pair</i>

770
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,876
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

771
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:23,632
<i>Thought there was a spotlight
We could share</i>

772
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:26,844
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

773
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:31,640
I won't pretend this
isn't something of a blow, my old friend.

774
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:36,186
One or two loans will now require

775
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,940
a radical renegotiation, you know?

776
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:44,820
But nothing I can't smooth over
with a little Valenti charm.

777
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:59,209
<i>Take a look at us</i>

778
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:02,921
<i>Now</i>

779
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:13,682
It's the school's brownstone, not yours.

780
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:16,476
I'm done. I did not sign up for this.

781
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:20,022
Mr. Primm, for you.

782
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:23,192
Oh, good, it's the man of the hour.

783
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:26,528
You're a member of the neighborhood?
Time to earn your spot.

784
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:28,447
Okay, great.

785
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:35,537
Get the money.

786
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:44,630
Show business.

787
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:54,932
Oh, please, sit.

788
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:56,892
Come in.

789
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:01,855
I don't wanna be unneighborly.

790
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:02,898
Really, I don't.

791
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:08,487
And no one loves music and singing
and dancing more than me, you know.

792
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:10,948
Just not at 3:00 in the morning.

793
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,742
So if you could find it in your hearts

794
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:15,494
to sign the petition,

795
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:19,289
and override the school's power
to allow awful families like this...

796
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:21,625
- Okay, now hold on just a second...
- No.

797
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:24,211
- Well...
- That's just Josh.

798
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,838
- Practicing wrestling.
- Trampoline.

799
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:27,089
On a trampoline.

800
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,258
He wrestles on a trampoline
that we'll get rid of.

801
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:32,344
Sure, but if it's not that,
and it's something else,

802
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,721
something that you're hiding from us,

803
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:37,558
something that
you think you'll get in trouble for,

804
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:40,227
well, I believe
now is the time to share it.

805
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:43,856
Do you mind if I join you?

806
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:46,233
- Valenti.
- Alistair Grumps.

807
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:47,818
Alistair Grumps.

808
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,862
How in the world are you?

809
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:55,909
Is that the same sofa?

810
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:58,328
You literally have not changed a thing.

811
01:07:59,496 --> 01:08:02,791
You see, Alistair and I grew up together.

812
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:05,502
- Have you been drinking?
- Yes, I have.

813
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,755
I always feel like the world
looks better with a glass of champagne.

814
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:10,465
A glass of champagne.

815
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:12,217
Get out. This is none of your business.

816
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:15,304
It is, it is,
because if the Primms are the problem,

817
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:19,683
then I, as their houseguest,
I'm part of the problem too, am I not?

818
01:08:19,765 --> 01:08:20,600
A large part.

819
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:24,188
With your permission, I'd like
to be part of the solution as well.

820
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,647
Would you mind, please?

821
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:26,773
Thank you.

822
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,986
- Delicious.
- Per usual, Hector, you're overstepping.

823
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:33,863
We are not the only ones
who overstepped the mark.

824
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:37,033
We, for instance,
haven't mounted security cameras

825
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,911
throughout the neighborhood,

826
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:41,662
filming other residents
without their consent.

827
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:50,546
No permission asked?

828
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,631
None.

829
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:53,759
- No.
- No. Were releases signed?

830
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:55,051
- No.
- No.

831
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:58,889
Well, if it was me,
I'd go straight to the police.

832
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,019
Out, all of you.

833
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:05,645
Everyone, get out of here.

834
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:07,773
Come on.

835
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:10,317
This meeting
will be reconvened at a later date.

836
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,109
Thank you so much for coming.

837
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:13,654
Excuse me.

838
01:09:15,154 --> 01:09:16,073
Not you.

839
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:21,745
I can assure you, Alistair,
we have absolutely nothing to talk about.

840
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:25,666
Why don't we see about that?

841
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:31,921
- Hector had this whole performance.
- Even Marjory was miffed.

842
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:34,131
- Mr. Grumps's jaw was...
- She was so upset.

843
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:35,384
- Hector.
- Hector.

844
01:09:35,466 --> 01:09:37,219
Oh, thank you.

845
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,389
- Thank you so much.
- That was incredible.

846
01:09:40,471 --> 01:09:43,015
No, no, no.
You have all been extraordinary.

847
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,977
It was the least I could do.

848
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,185
Thank you, really.

849
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:49,189
So I have to make myself presentable.

850
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:52,734
I'll be back
in two shakes of a lamb's tail, okay?

851
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:10,669
Hide him.

852
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,754
Now.

853
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:14,131
Go.

854
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:21,096
Stay here.

855
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:25,934
Hector, Hector.

856
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:30,230
Where is he?

857
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:34,359
I'm gonna look around back.
Just in case. Could be a big one.

858
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:37,321
Stay back, stay back.

859
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,908
- No, no.
- Josh.

860
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:42,409
He won't hurt you.

861
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,413
Lyle.

862
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,001
You have to sing.

863
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:55,130
Now.

864
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:57,799
No.

865
01:10:57,883 --> 01:10:58,717
No.

866
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,856
- Watch your step there.
- Easy.

867
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:14,566
No.

868
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:21,114
{\an8}You're clear.

869
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,337
- Josh.
- I'll talk to him.

870
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,380
I knew it.

871
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,799
I knew you were up to no good.

872
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:41,802
Hiding a crocodile.
You've broken so many rules.

873
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:44,930
Wait till I tell your school.
They'll throw you out of the city.

874
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:48,183
You'll be gone,
all of you, by Thanksgiving.

875
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:38,192
Lyle.

876
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,194
Hey, hey, buddy.

877
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:41,570
Hey, are you okay?

878
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:44,698
I came as soon as it opened.

879
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,575
- Lyle.
- Hey, buddy.

880
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:55,918
Hey, no hands through the bars.

881
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:57,169
Thank you.

882
01:12:57,252 --> 01:12:58,545
You, get back.

883
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:11,266
We have to do something.
He must hate it here.

884
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:15,354
Look, Josh, they understand crocodiles.
They're gonna look after him.

885
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:18,065
Then why aren't they giving him
pork-and-rosemary vol-au-vents,

886
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:20,859
or chicken Milanese
with a dash of salsa verde?

887
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:22,653
He's a crocodile, sweetheart.

888
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,864
He's a very special crocodile,
but he is still a crocodile.

889
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,867
He has to learn
to live with the other crocodiles.

890
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:31,078
- No, no. We can break him out.
- Josh.

891
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,455
It's not a bank.
It's a zoo. How hard can it be?

892
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:34,748
Josh, stop.

893
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:38,085
Okay? We'll come visit Lyle
every day, I promise.

894
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:42,005
We'll speak to the zoo, and ask them
to let us bring Lyle his favorite treats.

895
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:43,924
There's only so much we can do.

896
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:47,469
Not all problems have a solution, Josh.

897
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:51,974
No, you don't get to decide that.

898
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:53,767
Not for me. Not anymore.

899
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:57,020
My whole life, I've been scared,

900
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,730
because you've been scared.

901
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,525
But I'm not scared anymore.

902
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:03,068
Because of Lyle.

903
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:06,280
He changed everything for me.

904
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:07,698
And not just for me.

905
01:14:07,781 --> 01:14:09,116
For you too. So...

906
01:14:10,242 --> 01:14:11,785
I'm not gonna leave here.

907
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:14,913
I'm not just gonna leave here without...

908
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,707
- Leave here without...
- Josh?

909
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:20,460
- Wait, Josh, Josh, Josh.
- Oh, my God.

910
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:22,504
Josh, are you okay?

911
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:25,132
- Josh. Get his inhaler.
- It's in his jacket.

912
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,258
Call 911.

913
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:34,224
He had a panic attack
that triggered his asthma.

914
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:36,059
It's good he had his inhaler.

915
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,104
He's gonna be fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

916
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,105
Thank you, sir.

917
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:45,319
- You okay, bud?
- Yeah.

918
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:46,820
- You sure?
- Yeah.

919
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,506
<i>We had nights of endless music</i>

920
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:11,887
<i>We were dizzy dancing till the dawn</i>

921
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:18,060
<i>We were free
Singing sweet harmonies with the city</i>

922
01:15:20,062 --> 01:15:23,774
<i>But maybe that was someone else's song</i>

923
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:28,487
<i>Back to earth again</i>

924
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:32,533
<i>You knew where this was headed
And honestly you're better off</i>

925
01:15:32,616 --> 01:15:36,203
<i>Better here where you belong</i>

926
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:40,374
<i>You got caught up in the colors</i>

927
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:43,085
<i>You got wrapped up in the ride</i>

928
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:46,463
<i>You thought the feeling was forever</i>

929
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:49,424
<i>And the stars were on your side</i>

930
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:52,761
<i>It was lovely while it lasted</i>

931
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:55,556
<i>But it wasn't meant to stay</i>

932
01:15:55,639 --> 01:16:00,477
<i>Still you let yourself get carried away</i>

933
01:16:01,812 --> 01:16:07,025
<i>I guess I let myself get carried away</i>

934
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:11,321
<i>We got carried away</i>

935
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:14,074
<i>Carried away</i>

936
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:17,494
<i>Got carried away</i>

937
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:19,288
<i>Carried away</i>

938
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:26,003
<i>So we got mixed up in the madness</i>

939
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:31,633
<i>But wasn't it a perfect mess we made?</i>

940
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,720
<i>Well, you live and you learn</i>

941
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:38,182
<i>You return
To the safe and the simple</i>

942
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:44,062
<i>And behind our walls
We fall back into place</i>

943
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:48,400
<i>Back to earth again</i>

944
01:16:48,483 --> 01:16:52,696
<i>You're through with pretending
'Cause this is how the ending goes</i>

945
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:56,617
<i>Now you're here where you belong</i>

946
01:16:57,576 --> 01:17:00,871
<i>We got caught up in the colors</i>

947
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:03,665
<i>We got wrapped up in the ride</i>

948
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:07,085
<i>We thought the feeling was forever</i>

949
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:10,255
<i>And the stars were on our side</i>

950
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:13,342
<i>It was lovely while it lasted</i>

951
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,053
<i>But it wasn't meant to stay</i>

952
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:20,933
{\an8}<i>We just let ourselves get carried away</i>

953
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,937
<i>We got carried away</i>

954
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,023
<i>Carried away</i>

955
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:31,443
<i>Got carried away</i>

956
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:34,279
<i>Carried away</i>

957
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:36,073
<i>Carried away</i>

958
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:38,242
<i>Lost in a fantasy</i>

959
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:40,786
<i>Of all we were gonna be</i>

960
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:43,747
<i>Carried away</i>

961
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,083
<i>Carried away</i>

962
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:53,674
<i>It was lovely while it lasted</i>

963
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:56,301
<i>It was never meant to stay</i>

964
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:03,684
<i>But we let ourselves get carried away</i>

965
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:11,358
<i>I guess I let myself get carried away</i>

966
01:18:35,299 --> 01:18:36,300
Hey.

967
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:39,845
Can you believe it?

968
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:43,473
I still can't believe it.
We're gonna be on <i>Show Us What You Got</i>.

969
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:45,392
That's great.

970
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:47,519
You deserve it.

971
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:50,564
Listen.

972
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:52,357
Don't give up.

973
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:56,528
When Malfoy escaped, I thought
I'd never see him again either.

974
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:01,658
Malfoy? The pet rattlesnake
my crazy Uncle Ernie gave me?

975
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:05,287
He was gone for six weeks.
We all thought he was dead.

976
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,665
Until the neighbors found him
in the back of their toaster oven.

977
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,754
Miracles do happen, Josh.

978
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:30,354
There he goes.

979
01:19:41,406 --> 01:19:42,824
Mom, I'm fine.

980
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,619
I know you're fine.
I'm gonna make sure you stay that way.

981
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:46,703
Come on.

982
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:04,555
Where you going?

983
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,015
- Taking the trash out.
- Okay.

984
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,684
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

985
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,875
How could you do it?

986
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:36,211
I've asked myself
the same question over and over, Josh.

987
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:40,174
But, you see, I've got nothing.

988
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,010
No family, no friends.

989
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:44,595
Then why do you keep leaving him?

990
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:45,929
When Lyle choked,

991
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:49,224
I had to go back and make it on my own.

992
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:51,977
Again. Yes.

993
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,230
But I couldn't,
because no one's interested in...

994
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:57,733
me.

995
01:20:58,483 --> 01:21:00,777
And I owe a lot of people a lot of money.

996
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:01,987
A lot of money.

997
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:05,741
So when Alistair Grumps offered me
that cash, I had to take it.

998
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:08,785
Out of need, out of fear, out of weakness.

999
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:13,081
And I've hated myself for doing it.

1000
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:15,417
Good, because I hate you too.

1001
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:19,129
But this is not about me, or about you.
It's about Lyle.

1002
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:23,383
You know as well as I do,
we can't leave him in that zoo.

1003
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,677
So if you have the stomach for it,

1004
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:29,431
if you have the fire in your belly
I know you have,

1005
01:21:29,515 --> 01:21:30,891
you have,

1006
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,436
you, young man, are going to help me
break that crocodile out of the zoo.

1007
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,191
Yes, because we have magic on our side.

1008
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:40,651
The power of illusion.

1009
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:43,195
Magical magic.

1010
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,949
There is no magic, Hector.

1011
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,998
I'll be at the East Gate at 4 a.m.

1012
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:56,708
Four a.m. Be there.

1013
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:53,390
<i>Join us live tomorrow,
right here in New York City.</i>

1014
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:58,395
<i>We're crowning the world's next superstar
on the finale of </i>Show Us What You Got<i>.</i>

1015
01:23:00,606 --> 01:23:02,482
<i>Oh, no...</i>

1016
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:12,659
- What do we got here?
- My dear fellow.

1017
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:14,828
May I have some assistance, please?

1018
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:20,542
I thought I had this trick down,
but I've got myself in a bit of a pickle.

1019
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:21,460
Please.

1020
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:26,465
- Okay. Some sort of handcuff trick?
- Thank you.

1021
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:29,259
This looks crazy.
Maybe if you move that way...

1022
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:30,636
Hey.

1023
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:32,262
Hey, hey.

1024
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,223
Magical magic.

1025
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:36,141
Let me out of here.

1026
01:23:36,225 --> 01:23:37,809
This won't take long. I promise.

1027
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:40,729
No, you can't go in there.
You can't go in there.

1028
01:23:40,812 --> 01:23:42,481
Come back here. Come back here.

1029
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:53,867
Lyle.

1030
01:23:58,413 --> 01:23:59,498
Lyle.

1031
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:04,086
Not Lyle.

1032
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:06,004
Not Lyle.

1033
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:11,635
Not good.

1034
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:13,929
This was seriously your plan?

1035
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,348
I knew you'd come.

1036
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:19,768
Yes. Climb up there,
and catch my rope, please.

1037
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:21,687
You have to get me out of here.

1038
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:22,604
Josh?

1039
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:25,399
- Come on. Josh.
- Lyle.

1040
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:28,777
Lyle.

1041
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:30,362
Lyle.

1042
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,782
Help me. Help me.

1043
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:38,161
Lyle.

1044
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,248
No, no, no.

1045
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:42,249
Josh?

1046
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:45,711
You have to talk to him.
Tell him to help me.

1047
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,255
It's not me
that has to talk to him, Hector.

1048
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:50,048
It's you.

1049
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:51,466
But...

1050
01:24:54,845 --> 01:24:59,850
I realize I may not have always acted
in the best way possible, Lyle.

1051
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,978
But I showed you the world.

1052
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:05,355
I introduced you to white truffle oil.

1053
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:06,982
I taught you the moonwalk.

1054
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:09,067
Okay, fine, fine.

1055
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:12,237
I apologize. My behavior was unforgivable.

1056
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:14,781
I used you, and I abandoned you.

1057
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:18,202
And it's my fault you're here.

1058
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:20,162
But, please, come back with me.

1059
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:22,039
Come back to where you belong.

1060
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,124
Back to...

1061
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:33,800
Back to Josh.

1062
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:39,806
And the Primms.

1063
01:25:42,518 --> 01:25:43,519
To your family.

1064
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:00,702
We gotta get you out of here.

1065
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:08,126
Tell me the second part
of your plan is better.

1066
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:09,711
Not better. It's perfect.

1067
01:26:09,795 --> 01:26:12,589
I've got Evangelyne
parked up by the gates.

1068
01:26:12,673 --> 01:26:14,508
We can outrun anyone on her.

1069
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:16,552
But Lyle can't just keep running.

1070
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:19,763
Of course he can.
You'd be amazed what you can outrun.

1071
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:21,348
- Ex-wives.
- Hands up.

1072
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:22,766
Creditors.

1073
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:25,936
Park rangers.

1074
01:26:26,019 --> 01:26:28,105
No, no, this is not a life.

1075
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,691
We have to show people what Lyle can do.

1076
01:26:31,483 --> 01:26:33,402
That they don't have to be scared of him.

1077
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:35,070
We gotta show them...

1078
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:52,129
Go, take Lyle. I've got this.

1079
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:55,883
Sorry, not this one.

1080
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,263
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1081
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:06,727
Prepare to have your flabber truly gasted.

1082
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:20,365
No, we have no one to drive it.

1083
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:48,477
Go, go, go.

1084
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,270
Go. Come on, Josh.

1085
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:51,688
Come on.

1086
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:53,565
<i>They're leaving the park. Call the police.</i>

1087
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:54,483
Copy.

1088
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:59,112
Sorry.

1089
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:07,037
How much further?

1090
01:28:14,753 --> 01:28:15,671
Lyle.

1091
01:28:18,632 --> 01:28:20,634
All units, we got a crocodile
on a motorcycle,

1092
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,261
entering the Theater District.

1093
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:23,929
<i>You got a what?</i>

1094
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:16,148
Where's Josh?
He's not in his room. I looked everywhere.

1095
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,489
What's he doing in Times Square?

1096
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:27,075
Hey, hey.

1097
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:28,410
I'm on the steps.

1098
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:30,621
Yeah, I need your help. Where is it?

1099
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:34,082
I'm at the backstage door.

1100
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:44,426
What are you doing here?

1101
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:48,555
Is...?

1102
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:49,640
Is...?

1103
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:52,976
Yes, and we need
to show people what he can do.

1104
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,603
We need your help.

1105
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:56,647
Trudy.

1106
01:29:58,148 --> 01:29:59,149
Follow me.

1107
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:03,820
Whoa, hey.

1108
01:30:04,363 --> 01:30:08,158
Kaysha from Kingsport, check.
Where's Kaysha from...?

1109
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:13,163
Security?

1110
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:15,541
Yet another unbelievable performance.

1111
01:30:15,624 --> 01:30:19,336
Text your vote to the long number
on the bottom of your screens.

1112
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:22,673
Once again, Tamia and Talullah.

1113
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:25,384
And if you thought
the talent stopped there,

1114
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:26,718
oh, boy, are...

1115
01:30:40,107 --> 01:30:42,025
{\an8}- What is happening?
- What is going on?

1116
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:44,236
Wait, is that a real crocodile?

1117
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,410
<i>Do you have him?</i>

1118
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:52,619
Got him, sir. Copy.

1119
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:03,714
You're just gonna have to trust me now.

1120
01:31:04,298 --> 01:31:05,132
This is it.

1121
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:07,384
Lyle, you have to sing.

1122
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:11,430
It's okay.

1123
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:15,976
We'll do it together.

1124
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:42,002
<i>Maybe we started pretty small</i>

1125
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:45,047
<i>But take a look at us now</i>

1126
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:48,800
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1127
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:55,057
{\an8}<i>Suddenly standing 10 feet tall</i>

1128
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,684
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1129
01:31:57,768 --> 01:32:02,731
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1130
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:07,736
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1131
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:16,161
<i>So take a look at us</i>

1132
01:32:17,496 --> 01:32:18,830
You have to show them.

1133
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:25,420
<i>Take a look at us</i>

1134
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:29,675
<i>Now</i>

1135
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:32,719
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1136
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:39,643
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1137
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,940
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1138
01:32:45,524 --> 01:32:49,945
<i>When that perfect plan's
Going off the rails</i>

1139
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:53,156
<i>A heap of trouble is on our tails</i>

1140
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:57,286
<i>It's time to polish up those scales</i>

1141
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:59,872
<i>And give it all we've got</i>

1142
01:32:59,955 --> 01:33:03,834
<i>'Cause in the center of the spotlight</i>

1143
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:07,337
<i>We just might have found our spot</i>

1144
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:11,258
- Come on.
- Come on, let's go.

1145
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:20,225
<i>Give us a spotlight and a crowd</i>

1146
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:21,643
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1147
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:23,562
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1148
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:26,064
<i>Ready to sing our song out loud</i>

1149
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:28,150
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1150
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:31,486
<i>The big shebang</i>

1151
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,905
<i>Our grand debut</i>

1152
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:35,908
<i>Now we got the hang
Of the me plus you</i>

1153
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:41,705
{\an8}<i>Seems our dreams
Just might come through somehow</i>

1154
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:44,750
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1155
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,753
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1156
01:33:47,836 --> 01:33:50,088
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1157
01:33:50,172 --> 01:33:53,008
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1158
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:55,802
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1159
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:59,139
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1160
01:33:59,223 --> 01:34:02,100
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1161
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:04,811
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1162
01:34:04,895 --> 01:34:07,814
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1163
01:34:08,398 --> 01:34:11,360
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1164
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:13,362
<i>Yeah</i>

1165
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:21,203
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1166
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:33,423
All right.

1167
01:34:50,524 --> 01:34:54,152
{\an8}The point I'm making,
Your Honor, is that nothing has changed.

1168
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:55,904
So the crocodile sang.

1169
01:34:55,988 --> 01:34:56,947
So what?

1170
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:58,782
It wasn't even that good.

1171
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:02,703
Oh, you're just impressed
because it was a crocodile.

1172
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:05,998
It was still broken out of the zoo.

1173
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:10,669
And according to every single one
of the city's very own regulations,

1174
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:14,715
it cannot be kept in a domestic residence.

1175
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:18,468
- Order, order.
- It's okay.

1176
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:22,389
I'm afraid the plaintiff is right.

1177
01:35:24,308 --> 01:35:26,226
But who wants to be merely right

1178
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:28,979
when you can be
fabulously triumphant instead?

1179
01:35:29,062 --> 01:35:30,606
Good morning, Your Honor. Excuse me.

1180
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,650
I have some documents here
that were stolen from me

1181
01:35:33,734 --> 01:35:36,236
which are
of vital importance to this case.

1182
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,237
What documents?

1183
01:35:37,321 --> 01:35:40,282
The original deeds
to the house on East 88th Street.

1184
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:42,784
How'd you get those?
Those were under my bed.

1185
01:35:42,868 --> 01:35:44,953
I was led to them by a new friend.

1186
01:35:47,915 --> 01:35:49,041
Why?

1187
01:35:49,124 --> 01:35:50,792
- Let me see that.
- Of course.

1188
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:54,880
Those papers date from the time
of my maternal grandmother,

1189
01:35:54,963 --> 01:35:56,757
Evelyn T. Valenti.

1190
01:35:57,341 --> 01:36:00,135
Not just the woman
who built the house on East 88th Street,

1191
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:03,889
but the woman
who was the founder of the New York Zoo.

1192
01:36:03,972 --> 01:36:05,432
- This is nonsense.
- What?

1193
01:36:05,516 --> 01:36:08,477
This is a special deed
granted by the City of New York.

1194
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,272
In acknowledgment to my grandmother's
contributions to the city,

1195
01:36:12,356 --> 01:36:15,526
and to accommodate
her fascination for the animals.

1196
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:18,445
"The house on East 88th Street
is hereby granted

1197
01:36:18,529 --> 01:36:23,700
a special waiver
to house any exotic creature as a pet."

1198
01:36:24,326 --> 01:36:28,497
Certainly Your Honor cannot be
stupid enough to consider this.

1199
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:33,752
Approved.

1200
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:35,295
Yes.

1201
01:36:37,172 --> 01:36:40,008
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

1202
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:41,760
I demand a mistrial.

1203
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:43,136
This is absurd.

1204
01:36:44,221 --> 01:36:45,597
Wait a second. Loretta?

1205
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:47,516
- Hey.
- Loretta?

1206
01:36:55,482 --> 01:36:57,860
Keep your filthy hands off of my Loretta!

1207
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:04,700
All right, everybody, let's go.

1208
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:05,909
Relax, we got time.

1209
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:08,245
I'm gonna get the sunscreen.

1210
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:11,373
Wait, wait. What's all of this? Where...?

1211
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:12,708
Hector, good morning.

1212
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:14,751
- Where are you going?
- Get in the car, guys.

1213
01:37:14,835 --> 01:37:18,255
Hold on. I've already got Lyle
over 200 bookings.

1214
01:37:18,338 --> 01:37:20,299
Two hundred bookings in New York alone.

1215
01:37:20,382 --> 01:37:23,760
Once we roll out a national tour,
we're gonna be swimming in cash.

1216
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:27,472
We're not going on a national tour.
We're going on vacation.

1217
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:28,599
On a what?

1218
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:31,685
Have you ever
even been on vacation before, Lyle?

1219
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:37,274
I got you a floatie.

1220
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:41,278
That's cute.

1221
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:51,955
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

1222
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:54,750
We'll do a stadium tour instead.

1223
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:56,043
Fewer dates,

1224
01:37:56,126 --> 01:37:58,504
but we'll pack in just as many people.

1225
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:04,051
Bye.

1226
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:07,262
Bye.

1227
01:38:10,224 --> 01:38:11,183
Bye.

1228
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:13,393
Hector?

1229
01:38:13,477 --> 01:38:14,311
Yes?

1230
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,775
I'm sorry, kid, but...

1231
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,069
Do it, Malfoy.

1232
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:42,172
Does he have an agent?

1233
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:46,969
He does now.

1234
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:52,140
He's got an attitude.

1235
01:38:55,727 --> 01:38:56,562
Let's go.

1236
01:38:58,021 --> 01:38:59,273
And we're off.

1237
01:39:07,155 --> 01:39:08,365
How about...?

1238
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:12,494
Play Lyle's music.

1239
01:39:25,966 --> 01:39:29,511
<i>But the biggest kick I ever got</i>

1240
01:39:29,595 --> 01:39:32,764
<i>Was doing a thing
Called the Crocodile Rock</i>

1241
01:39:32,848 --> 01:39:35,642
<i>While the other kids
Were rocking 'round the clock</i>

1242
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:37,060
Hey, Loretta.

1243
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:40,147
<i>We were hopping and bopping
To the Crocodile Rock, yeah</i>

1244
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,566
<i>Croc Rocking is something shocking</i>

1245
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:45,694
<i>When your feet just can't keep still</i>

1246
01:39:46,236 --> 01:39:51,950
<i>I never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will</i>

1247
01:39:52,492 --> 01:39:55,495
<i>Oh, Lordy, mama
Those Friday nights</i>

1248
01:39:55,579 --> 01:39:58,957
<i>When Susie wore her dresses tight</i>

1249
01:39:59,499 --> 01:40:04,379
<i>Crocodile Rocking was out of sight</i>
