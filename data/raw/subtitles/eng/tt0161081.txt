1
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:57,729
Good morning, beauty.

2
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,326
Let's go, or we'll never
leave on time.

3
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,608
I'm totally ready.

4
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,289
Come on. I'll make you some waffles.

5
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:10,972
-Mother. . . .
-Caitlin.

6
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,925
Blueberries!

7
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,367
Hey, Cooper.

8
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,251
You want some breakfast too?

9
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:19,886
You want some waffles?

10
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,731
Good boy.

11
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,729
Look. They're at it again.

12
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,810
Christ, that's twice in. . . .

13
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,571
When did they move in?

14
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,923
Three weeks. What's their name?

15
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:58,842
Feur, I think. Psych department.
Figures, they're all nuts.

16
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,610
She's awake.

17
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:10,286
We'll be quiet.

18
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:11,688
Quick and quiet.

19
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,643
I don't want to be either.

20
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:21,209
-When's she out of here?
-Norman Spencer!

21
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:25,487
All right, I can't stand
the rejection. I'm going for a run.

22
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:28,291
Hey, you okay?

23
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,042
Yeah.

24
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,885
Come on, Pooper. Let's go.

25
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:37,730
We'll have to leave by 1 1
if we want to beat the traffic.

26
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,451
Eleven o'clock.

27
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,084
You know, you can call me. . .

28
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:10,090
. . .whenever you want.

29
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:12,045
Sweetheart. . .

30
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,683
. . .I've known this day was coming
for a long time.

31
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,727
I have Norman, and the garden
and the new house.

32
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,571
You really don't have to worry.

33
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:22,809
-I'm just saying--
-Really.

34
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,442
Okay.

35
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:30,647
Mom?

36
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:33,962
Mother?

37
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:37,091
I have to go.

38
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,328
Honey, if I don't get you out of here
quick, they'll make you enroll.

39
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,291
I'll call you.

40
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,085
-Bye.
-Bye.

41
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,728
Come home often.

42
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,207
Call your mom.

43
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,650
Beatrice, it's nice to meet you.

44
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,289
-You take care of each other.
-I won't go to a bar without her.

45
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,085
I'm just kidding.

46
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,041
Bye.

47
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:10,882
Well, I almost made it.

48
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,607
What are you reading?

49
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:41,771
"Genetic Repair Mechanisms
in Eukaryotic Organisms. "

50
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,123
Eukaryotic. How is it?

51
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,925
Excellent.

52
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,364
Oh, a couple of. . .

53
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:53,610
. . .Swedish sailor cells just gang-
divided a virginal cheerleader cell.

54
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,085
Almost there.

55
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:06,481
-If you have to work. . . .
-No, no. Just let me get this.

56
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:10,970
Okay, almost.

57
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,322
There.

58
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:15,768
How's it going?

59
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:18,441
Great. I think we cracked it.

60
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,532
The prenatal thing?

61
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,008
Yeah, I targeted repair.

62
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,926
You are so brilliant.

63
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,128
Yep.

64
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,732
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk. . .

65
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,969
. . .Norman Spencer.

66
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,612
How are you?

67
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:40,371
I'm fine.

68
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:43,128
I am. Yeah, really.

69
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,283
It's okay if you're not, you know.

70
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:48,688
To tell you the truth, I'm. . .

71
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,451
. . .excited.

72
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,247
Really?

73
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:56,082
Yeah, I'm gonna get my life back.
Get some time for myself.

74
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,204
Some time for us.

75
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,331
Did a great job.

76
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,165
She's a good kid.

77
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,886
We did.

78
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:15,405
Just us now.

79
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,325
I know.

80
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:22,287
Tired?

81
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,447
Nope.

82
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:28,487
Want to fool around?

83
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:30,288
Yep.

84
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:56,811
Jesus.

85
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,762
What is he doing to her?

86
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,089
-I guess they're making up.
-Wait.

87
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,206
Leave it open.

88
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:11,732
Think we can take 'em?

89
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,168
It's worth a try.

90
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,404
Do the brilliant Norman stuff
some more.

91
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,804
And speak up.

92
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,048
Hello?

93
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:51,762
Hello?

94
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,692
Mrs. Feur?

95
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:06,565
Hello?

96
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,405
Are you all right?

97
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:15,608
He's so. . . .

98
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:17,641
It's too much. . .

99
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:19,764
. . .and I can't. . . .

100
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:22,284
I can't breathe.

101
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,526
And I'm afraid.

102
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,724
What? What are you afraid of?

103
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,128
That one day I'll just. . .

104
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,130
. . .disappear.

105
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,969
Is there something I can do?

106
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:36,242
Can l. . .?

107
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:38,572
I've never even met you.

108
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,331
I know. I'm sorry.

109
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:41,483
I've been consumed.

110
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,450
This fence. . .

111
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:46,606
. . .it's so. . . .

112
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:51,887
I'm sorry. Listen, would you like
to come over for coffee, or--?

113
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,765
Oh, God, he's back.

114
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,653
I'm sorry. Please forget what I said.

115
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,413
I don't even know you!
Please!

116
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,492
She sounded...

117
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,206
-. . .terrified.
-Of what?

118
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,005
Of him, I think.

119
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:24,362
Did she say that?

120
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,245
More or less.

121
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,488
I want to go over there.
Let's go and--

122
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,285
-Why?
-To see if she's all right--

123
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:35,532
Honey, we're not going to march over
to our new neighbors and accuse them--

124
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:40,045
-That's not what I'm suggesting.
-Especially since they'll keep us up. . .

125
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,481
. . .with their sexual olympics.

126
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,445
What if something happened to her?

127
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,763
-Nothing will happen.
-I'd never forgive. . . .

128
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,533
Honey, people argue.

129
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,451
People fight.

130
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,407
It's not our business.

131
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:05,723
-I've got to work tonight.
-I know.

132
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,213
This conference is the first
big preview of my paper.

133
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:13,007
I've just got to stay focused
a little while longer.

134
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,889
This is what I've been working for.

135
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:19,323
I just wish you could have heard her.

136
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:20,972
I'll tell you what I'll do.

137
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:24,085
I'll call Harvey Tomes tomorrow
in the psych department. . .

138
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:28,043
. . .and I'll see what I can
find out about him.

139
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,732
Promise?

140
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,492
Yeah, I promise.

141
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,648
Hey, lady!

142
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:28,606
What are you doing?

143
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,089
Looking for you.

144
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,006
What are you doing?

145
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,729
Just trying to drop off this
welcome thing for the new neighbors.

146
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:38,922
Not home?

147
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,361
Guess not.

148
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,242
-You are so good at this.
-If I were, I'd have done it weeks ago.

149
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,411
I gave my neighbors wine
that someone left at my house.

150
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,531
-Are you staying?
-Just came by to see how you're doing.

151
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,644
Good. I'm good.

152
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,766
Are you?

153
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:59,649
Why does everyone
find that so surprising?

154
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,492
Because your only daughter
just left for college. . .

155
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,769
. . .who you're extremely close with.

156
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,247
I'd be tripping.

157
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,408
Oh, right.

158
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,089
You had a hell of a year too.
The move, the new house. . .

159
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,248
. . .the garden.

160
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:13,488
The car.

161
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,490
A minor setback.

162
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:16,808
Was that a year ago?

163
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:18,287
This week.

164
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:19,812
Wow. Now Caitlin.

165
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,287
Big stress stuff.

166
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:22,812
Okay.

167
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:24,446
I'm a little tender.

168
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,609
Good. You're human.

169
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:30,328
And so far this week, my big task
is to take pictures of my roses. . .

170
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:32,165
. . .for the garden club.

171
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,767
Got here just in time, didn't l?

172
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,486
Brought you something.

173
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:39,571
It's Kambucha mushroom tea.

174
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,446
It soothes heartache
and promotes psychic wellness.

175
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:45,770
-Floriana suggested it.
-So you discuss me with your psychic?

176
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:49,124
No, and she's not really a psychic.
Just an enlightened spirit.

177
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,288
Like me.

178
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:53,166
That's worse.
You're gossiping about me.

179
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,771
Notice anything different?

180
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,726
Oh, my God. You bought it!

181
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:02,928
Nice.

182
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,488
It's a beautiful thing, alimony.

183
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:06,967
You lose a husband. . .

184
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,606
. . .get a car.

185
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:11,043
-Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
-Absolutely.

186
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:12,368
Cool.

187
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:14,564
I have to run. You take care.

188
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:16,372
Thanks for the tea.

189
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:53,926
Norman.

190
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,007
Norman.

191
00:18:58,733 --> 00:18:59,722
-Norman!
-What?

192
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:02,128
Come here. You have to see this.

193
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,371
-What's the matter?
-Look.

194
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,092
What, Claire?

195
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,761
I thought I saw. . . .

196
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:21,009
-I--
-What?

197
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:24,046
-I thought I saw something.
-Jesus Christ!

198
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:10,250
Hi, is Caitlin there?

199
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,967
Any idea when she'll be back?

200
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,608
You be sure to tell her I called?

201
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,371
Thanks, Beatrice.

202
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,767
Well, that's a first.

203
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,772
Cooper, come on.

204
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:27,406
Get your ball.

205
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,212
What's the matter?

206
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:34,007
Cooper, it's your favorite ball.

207
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,647
-Hello?
-Hi.

208
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,890
I'm stuck here for another
couple of hours. Sorry.

209
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,449
Unless you want me to come home?

210
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:22,649
No. No, it's fine.

211
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,127
You sure?

212
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,122
Claire?

213
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,123
Oh, absolutely. Take your time.

214
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,732
See you soon. Love you.

215
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,730
Love you. Bye.

216
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,411
Cooper!

217
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,964
Cooper!

218
00:22:57,773 --> 00:22:59,764
Fine. Have it your way.

219
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:55,053
We use different kinds.
Now we're using halothane.

220
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:57,483
Halothane? ls that a sedative?

221
00:23:57,693 --> 00:23:58,842
It's a dissociative.

222
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,965
It paralyzes motor function,
but leaves her conscious.

223
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:04,803
She can't move,
but knows what's going on.

224
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,243
-Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
-Hi, Teddy.

225
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,728
-How long does that last?
-Five minutes.

226
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,401
-Sometimes three.
-Can it be used on all mammals?

227
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:17,606
Yeah, any procedure where you want to
get the patient immobile, pain-free.

228
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:20,649
Hi. What are you doing here?

229
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:21,968
-Are you okay?
-I. . . .

230
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,368
I heard noises.

231
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:28,003
-What kind of noises? Where?
-At the house. I was scared.

232
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:30,408
-Did you call the police?
-No.

233
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:33,208
I'll have the police
check on the house while I'm gone.

234
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:34,892
Oh, great.

235
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:38,642
"Could you check in on my wife?
She's hearing voices. "

236
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,445
Wait till that gets around.

237
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:43,890
I'll be in New Haven for the
conference. I want you to feel safe.

238
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:45,367
I do.

239
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:48,133
I'm sure it was just. . .

240
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:50,446
. . .nothing.

241
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:54,203
Did you call about the Feurs?

242
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:56,210
Oh, yeah.

243
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:00,167
Harvey says the guy's harmless.
Wouldn't hurt a flea.

244
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,728
Warren. Warren Feur.

245
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,651
What about her?

246
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:07,811
I know he told me. . . .

247
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,684
I met Schumway today.

248
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,009
Who wrote that book you love.

249
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,731
They were doing some spiel
for the chemistry department. . .

250
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,844
. . .so Bob Shine introduces us.

251
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,523
You'll love this.
He looks right at me. . .

252
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,122
. . .and congratulates me
on Spencer's Theorem.

253
00:25:27,813 --> 00:25:29,769
He didn't know your father was dead?

254
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:31,248
He knew.

255
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:37,087
What?

256
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:39,484
You're so sensitive about that.

257
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:40,927
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

258
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,124
You always overreact.

259
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,729
I'll have to watch that, won't l?

260
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,246
Was it Mary?

261
00:25:58,453 --> 00:25:59,602
Mrs. Feur.

262
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:02,168
Warren and Mary?

263
00:26:03,613 --> 00:26:04,648
Yeah.

264
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,332
Mary. That's it.

265
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:09,611
I'm gonna do some work.

266
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,406
Hello?

267
00:27:46,293 --> 00:27:47,931
Mrs. Feur?

268
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,451
Can I help you?

269
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:04,571
Oh, yes.

270
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,083
Hi.

271
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,686
I'm Claire Spencer, from next door.

272
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:12,688
Nice to meet you.

273
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:16,369
I wanted to stop by and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

274
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:22,963
Thank you, but this really isn't
a good time. I'm running late.

275
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:25,172
Is your wife home?

276
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,883
No, she isn't.

277
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:30,969
When will she be back?

278
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,048
I have to go.

279
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,892
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.

280
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:45,763
What's he doing?

281
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,008
Eating dinner.

282
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:48,362
Alone.

283
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,366
TV dinner.

284
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:51,932
That's bad.

285
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:54,721
That's my shiatsu guy.

286
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:58,687
Listen, call me back if he starts in
on some serial-killer dessert...

287
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:00,611
...like ladyfingers.

288
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:03,044
-You got it.
-Bye.

289
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:06,848
Where did you go?

290
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,606
Shit!

291
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,810
Jesus, Claire.

292
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,844
-What the hell are you doing?
-I was looking--

293
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:58,771
-Spying.
-Spying on Mr. Feur.

294
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:00,804
-How come you're not dressed?
-Dressed?

295
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:02,844
Dinner with Stan.

296
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,805
-Tonight?
-Tonight.

297
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,846
-We're going to be--
-Fashionably five minutes late.

298
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:09,891
Are you saying he murdered his wife?

299
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,084
Is that so ridiculous?
She was terrified. . .

300
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:15,410
. . .and now she doesn't answer
the door, but her car's in the garage.

301
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:18,167
Maybe she was out,
or in bed with the flu.

302
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:21,410
-Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.
-Who are you calling?

303
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:24,850
-Restaurant.
-We're not at the center of the bridge.

304
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:27,009
You can't get service
until the center.

305
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,602
I know we're not at the center.

306
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:33,163
There. See?

307
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:35,929
Well, that's a relief.

308
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:37,088
Hi, Stan.

309
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,568
Hey, Claire. Norman.

310
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:41,764
-Sorry we're late.
-It's my fault.

311
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,042
We just got here.

312
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,721
-Where's the new squeeze?
-Here I am.

313
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,366
-This is--
-Elena?

314
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,966
Oh, my God. Claire!

315
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:51,084
I don't believe it!

316
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:54,929
-This is--
-We know each other.

317
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,488
-Norman.
-Hello, Norman. How do you do?

318
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,012
Claire, look at you!

319
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,726
You look beautiful.

320
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:05,450
Here was this brilliant conductor
in purple bikini briefs. . .

321
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,888
. . .with no bangs. . .

322
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,370
. . .cursing his ass off in Finnish.

323
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:14,486
Oh, Claire.

324
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:16,962
I made an honest woman of her.

325
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:19,403
How long have you been in Vermont?

326
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:21,484
Oh, well, Norman grew up here.

327
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:26,443
Remember Beau Flynn, head of cardio
at the hospital? He was just sacked.

328
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:28,843
I just dropped her off at college.

329
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:32,204
He was involved in some stalking
incident. An intern, some girl.

330
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:33,687
We're getting so old!

331
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,771
They don't screw around
with that anymore.

332
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:41,171
-When did we last get together?
-New York.

333
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:44,046
-Of course. Right after--
-Right after Michael died.

334
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:45,652
-Michael who?
-Marlov.

335
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:47,491
Claire's first husband.

336
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,331
-Oh, the musician.
-Yeah.

337
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:51,404
You know, we all toured together.

338
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:54,565
Have you heard her play?

339
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:56,001
No.

340
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,491
I would sit on-stage. . .

341
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:04,725
. . .during Claire's solo. . .

342
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:08,846
. . .and I mean, truly, I had tears
streaming down my face.

343
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,051
I mean, she's fabulous.

344
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:12,845
So why did you stop?

345
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,213
Well, one night, after a concert. . .

346
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:21,803
. . .I met a dashing, handsome. . .

347
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:24,933
. . .genius scientist. . .

348
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:28,808
. . .and three months later,
I was married.

349
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:33,441
Is that when you guys
moved up to Vermont?

350
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:36,730
No, we were living in Boston. . .

351
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:39,049
. . .when Norman was offered a position.

352
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:40,481
A position.

353
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:43,247
The DuPont Chair in genetics.

354
00:34:44,573 --> 00:34:47,849
I see. So now you're teaching
at your father's school here.

355
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,691
I actually don't. . .

356
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:51,645
. . .do much teaching anymore.

357
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,809
I run a research project.

358
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:01,884
Norman's father had this old stuffy--

359
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:04,846
--stately place on a lake.

360
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,726
-Which we're renovating.
-Practically gutted.

361
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,332
-No, we didn't.
-Yes, we did.

362
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:10,483
"Gutted. "

363
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:15,204
-Wait till you see it. It's beautiful.
-It is beautiful. You'll see it.

364
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:17,126
It's haunted.

365
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:18,688
No.

366
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:19,928
Is it really?

367
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,964
Claire's hearing things.

368
00:35:22,613 --> 00:35:24,604
What? What are you hearing?

369
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:33,129
I don't know. I heard. . .

370
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,608
. . .voices, whispering. . . .

371
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,766
A picture fell.

372
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:41,329
You know, I completely believe
in all that.

373
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,048
You do?

374
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:44,208
I do.

375
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,688
Wait a minute.
Who do you think it is?

376
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:50,323
I know exactly who it is.

377
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,405
It's my old man.

378
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,372
He's pissed about us
dicking around with the house.

379
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:02,922
Claire.

380
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:04,722
Jesus. . . .

381
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,807
It's all right.

382
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,771
Calm down, Claire.

383
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,611
It's okay.

384
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,652
Whose idea was it?

385
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:24,366
Mine. His.

386
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,404
We both thought. . . .

387
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,370
I didn't want to come here.

388
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,883
-Then why did you?
-He was worried about me.

389
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:33,446
-Your husband?
-Yes.

390
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:37,481
I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me
full of Prozac or lithium. . .

391
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,644
. . .so he can live out his life
in peace.

392
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:41,764
-Do you really think so?
-No.

393
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:43,452
Are you on medication?

394
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:46,253
No. Well, Valium.

395
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,727
For sleeping.

396
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,286
Having trouble sleeping?

397
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:50,926
Sometimes.

398
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,691
When I get anxious.

399
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:55,726
Do you get anxious only at night?

400
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,203
No, I only take Valium at night.

401
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:00,846
For sleeping.

402
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:03,965
Why do you get anxious?

403
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:06,047
I don't know.

404
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:08,688
Why do you think
your husband's worried?

405
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:10,611
Because. . . .

406
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:13,332
I don't know.

407
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:17,569
Because ever since Caitlin left--

408
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,685
Ever since my daughter left
for school. . .

409
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,164
. . .there have been. . . .

410
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,686
I've been. . . .

411
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,884
Why is this so hard?

412
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:32,085
Here. Have a fireball.

413
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:37,125
Thank you.

414
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:40,442
It's hard because I'm
a complete stranger. . .

415
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:43,446
. . .and you're talking about
incredibly personal things.

416
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:48,010
Besides, most people, when they
come the first time, are wondering. . .

417
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:50,769
. . .if I think they're crazy.

418
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:53,290
Don't worry. I'm required. . .

419
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,961
. . .to have three sessions
before I can commit.

420
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,406
That was a joke.

421
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:10,368
These are good. They're hot.

422
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:14,091
There's a ghost in my house.

423
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:20,129
I saw her in the water, beside me. . .

424
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,482
. . .in the bathtub.

425
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,241
What does she look like?

426
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,325
She looked like. . .

427
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:28,642
. . .me.

428
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:34,043
Only she had green eyes.

429
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,651
Any idea who she is?

430
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:40,925
Maybe. But I'd rather not say
just yet.

431
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:42,282
Fine.

432
00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:51,326
What do you think I should do?

433
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:52,802
Try to contact her.

434
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:57,286
Communicate with her somehow.
Find out what she wants.

435
00:41:58,573 --> 00:42:01,963
What do you want me to do?
Go buy a Ouija board?

436
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:10,367
Are we hoping the ghost
will have to use the potty?

437
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,966
This is where she was.

438
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:13,288
This is where l. . .

439
00:42:13,493 --> 00:42:14,448
. . .saw her.

440
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:16,012
That makes sense.

441
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,807
-Where did you finally find one?
-Kmart.

442
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:23,206
I think we're supposed to sit
in a protective circle, aren't we?

443
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:24,368
What's that for?

444
00:42:25,773 --> 00:42:27,570
-Where did you get it?
-Never mind.

445
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,646
You stole her shoe.

446
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:33,124
You have to have something
of the dead woman's.

447
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,209
Says who?

448
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,447
Is that blood on it?

449
00:42:36,693 --> 00:42:40,652
I don't know. Just place your fingers
on the message indicator.

450
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:42,685
Okay.

451
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:54,924
We wish to commune. . .

452
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,486
. . .with the spirit--

453
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,767
What?

454
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:01,492
"Wish to commune. "

455
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:03,362
-Forget it.
-What?

456
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:05,843
No, this whole thing is insane.

457
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,168
I'm sorry.

458
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:09,570
What's her first name?

459
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:13,287
Mary.

460
00:43:14,773 --> 00:43:15,762
Feur.

461
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:19,973
Mary Feur, Mary Feur. . . .

462
00:43:24,213 --> 00:43:26,283
We wish to communicate. . .

463
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:29,731
. . .with the spirit of Mary Feur.

464
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,723
Not much happening.

465
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:10,722
What was that?

466
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:14,092
It's flickering.

467
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,168
Yeah.

468
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:38,411
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

469
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:12,688
Cooper!

470
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:15,248
Listen...

471
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:18,082
. . .about our little séance.

472
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,092
Norman doesn't need to know.

473
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:23,083
-I won't tell if you won't.
-It's just that. . .

474
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:26,126
. . .ever since the accident. . .

475
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,164
. . .he treats me like I'm this. . .

476
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:30,841
. . .fragile, loopy. . . .

477
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:34,332
Well, I am seeing ghosts
in the bathtub, aren't l?

478
00:45:34,573 --> 00:45:37,645
You did wrap your car around a tree
doing, like, 80.

479
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:40,371
He was pretty shaken up.

480
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:43,645
-We all were.
-It was an accident. A year ago.

481
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:45,730
I'm fine.

482
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,647
Right?

483
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,724
Of course you are.

484
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:57,410
You're just not much of a medium,
however.

485
00:45:58,253 --> 00:45:59,845
I'll call you tomorrow.

486
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:01,168
Get some rest.

487
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:03,091
Did you pick up any dudes yet?

488
00:46:03,613 --> 00:46:05,126
I have one in the trunk.

489
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:09,567
Bye.

490
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,404
What do you want?

491
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,366
She's dead.

492
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:13,173
-Who's dead?
-You know damn well who's dead.

493
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:14,328
The Feur thing.

494
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:15,483
Listen to me.

495
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:17,923
He killed her and I'm not crazy.

496
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:21,648
Jody and I had a séance in the
bathroom, and nothing happened. . .

497
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:25,209
. . .but when I went back there
she was there. She was.

498
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:27,207
Wait a minute.

499
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:29,802
You had a séance?

500
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:34,882
-Are you angry with me?
-What?

501
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:39,485
-Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
-No.

502
00:49:40,253 --> 00:49:44,246
You know what I've got at stake for
this paper. How important it is to me.

503
00:49:44,453 --> 00:49:48,128
I can't help feeling that you're
trying to sabotage me, to hurt me.

504
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,130
Norman, this isn't about you.

505
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,164
Something is happening to me.

506
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:56,969
And it's not to get even, and it's
not some warped bid for attention.

507
00:49:57,173 --> 00:50:01,644
Something is happening in our house,
whether you like it or not.

508
00:50:04,093 --> 00:50:05,208
Claire.

509
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:07,567
Claire, stop.

510
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:08,888
You're overreacting.

511
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,890
Don't tell me how to react.

512
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,687
-Will you keep your voice down?
-I will not!

513
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:15,008
Maybe you're right.

514
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,010
Maybe I am losing my mind.

515
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:18,805
But what if I'm not?

516
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:20,571
What if she died. . .

517
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:21,922
. . .some horrible death?

518
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:23,930
Can we please not do this here?

519
00:50:24,213 --> 00:50:25,771
Oh, wow.

520
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:32,042
You.

521
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,164
You think you're smart, don't you?

522
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:35,931
You think you got away with it.

523
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,842
Well, I know you killed her,
you murdering son of a bitch!

524
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:40,963
Who?

525
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:42,606
Don't give me that shit.

526
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:44,565
Your wife.

527
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:47,608
She's very upset. Forgive us, please.

528
00:50:47,813 --> 00:50:48,882
Honey.

529
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,244
I didn't kill my wife.

530
00:50:53,573 --> 00:50:55,052
Are you all right?

531
00:50:57,453 --> 00:50:58,932
Come on, honey.

532
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:03,290
Come on. Let's go.

533
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:05,122
I'm sorry.

534
00:51:14,053 --> 00:51:15,008
You all right?

535
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:16,328
Oh. Yeah.

536
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,006
I'm fine.

537
00:51:18,853 --> 00:51:20,525
What happened? Just now?

538
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,725
I just saw Norman's face.

539
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:28,605
He was so frightened for me.

540
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:30,041
How's your marriage?

541
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:33,808
Good. Really good.

542
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:37,132
We've had our moments, I guess. . .

543
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,370
. . .but he's a wonderful husband
and father.

544
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:44,045
I mean, sure, he can be obsessed
with his work. . .

545
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:46,608
. . .and sometimes it's like. . .

546
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:50,928
. . .that he doesn't see me.

547
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,283
Or, you know. . .

548
00:51:53,493 --> 00:51:55,085
. . .Iike I'm. . . .

549
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:59,167
That there's something wrong. . .

550
00:52:00,293 --> 00:52:01,408
. . .with me.

551
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:05,012
That can't feel good.

552
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:07,126
No.

553
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:15,488
Okay.

554
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:18,645
I see where you're going with this. . .

555
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:21,686
. . .but my marriage is fine. No.

556
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:26,091
I have had some kind of
empty-nest episode. . .

557
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:28,807
. . .where I saw. . .

558
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:31,846
. . .some things that weren't there.

559
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:36,729
Let's deal with that.
I'm willing to deal with that.

560
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:07,244
"Thought you might need this.
Love, Jody. "

561
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,045
Mrs. Spencer.

562
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:33,451
I wanted to apologize
for scaring you like I did.

563
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:35,883
When I thought about
how it must have seemed--

564
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:38,687
Please. Let's just. . . .

565
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,086
Claire Spencer.

566
00:53:44,293 --> 00:53:45,931
Mary Feur.

567
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:49,205
-Would you like a cup of coffee?
-Very much.

568
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:51,682
That day at the fence...

569
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:54,168
. . .you seemed terrified.

570
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,048
I don't think I imagined that.

571
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:58,521
No.

572
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:01,284
What were you so afraid of?

573
00:54:03,293 --> 00:54:07,571
Have you ever felt so completely
consumed by a feeling for someone. . .

574
00:54:07,813 --> 00:54:10,407
. . .that you couldn't breathe?

575
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,933
Thought that your time together
was so. . .

576
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:17,842
. . .passionate and consuming that you
felt physical pain when they'd leave?

577
00:54:20,546 --> 00:54:21,501
Sure.

578
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:23,577
I couldn't catch my breath. . .

579
00:54:23,986 --> 00:54:25,180
. . .and I panicked.

580
00:54:25,906 --> 00:54:28,295
I never dreamed anyone would hear me.

581
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,663
I tried to leave him.

582
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:34,986
I went to my mother's in Providence. . .

583
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:36,939
. . .but he brought my things up. . .

584
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:39,296
. . .in the middle of the night. . .

585
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:41,304
. . .during the rainstorm.

586
00:54:41,506 --> 00:54:43,781
He pleaded with me to come home.

587
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:45,659
You must think I'm pathetic.

588
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,424
No.

589
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:50,140
I don't.

590
00:54:51,346 --> 00:54:55,578
I'll be quick. I've got to get Sidon
to okay my budget before his trip.

591
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:58,141
What's Templeton's wife's name again?

592
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:00,337
Lois. Phil and Lois Templeton.

593
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:03,936
Don't let her corner you,
she'll chew your ear off.

594
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:05,585
-Evening, Phil.
-Here they are.

595
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:07,020
How do you do? Hi.

596
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:10,218
Hi. Nice to see you again, Lois.

597
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:00,778
White wine, please.

598
00:56:06,186 --> 00:56:07,619
How are you holding up?

599
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:10,334
Just fine. It's a lovely party.

600
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:13,614
Norman was telling me the house
is finished.

601
00:56:13,826 --> 00:56:15,942
-Almost.
-Wonderful.

602
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:18,655
It's good to see you doing so well.

603
00:56:19,026 --> 00:56:19,981
Thank you.

604
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:22,461
Well, I was worried.

605
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,625
I don't think I've seen you since
Norman's reception here last year.

606
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:28,464
You were worried?

607
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:33,665
I swear, I've become that nosy old lady
I used to run away from at Amherst.

608
00:56:33,866 --> 00:56:36,175
No, I'm just not sure what you mean.

609
00:56:37,386 --> 00:56:39,900
You got so upset.

610
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,539
Oh, at the party.

611
00:56:42,786 --> 00:56:44,822
For the DuPont Chair.

612
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,300
You remember?

613
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:49,020
Well, I remember the party, but. . . .

614
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:52,824
Oh, God!

615
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:57,220
I had completely forgotten.

616
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:58,945
I broke your crystal.

617
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:00,340
Oh, my dear.

618
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:03,219
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.

619
00:57:03,746 --> 00:57:06,863
But you went completely pale.
You couldn't catch your breath.

620
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:09,899
It was as if you had seen a ghost.

621
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:54,900
"Missing girl. "

622
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:01,218
Madison Elizabeth.

623
00:58:03,306 --> 00:58:04,785
M-E.

624
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:18,975
Frank.

625
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,976
Madison Elizabeth. . .

626
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:24,095
. . .Frank.

627
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:28,582
M-E-F.

628
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:05,415
Claire?

629
00:59:07,826 --> 00:59:10,294
Hey, good morning.

630
00:59:13,946 --> 00:59:14,935
Up all night?

631
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,096
You okay?

632
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,658
Do you remember this?

633
00:59:32,586 --> 00:59:34,975
It's the girl that disappeared
last year.

634
00:59:37,186 --> 00:59:38,414
Did you know her?

635
00:59:38,986 --> 00:59:39,896
No.

636
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:49,377
Claire, I'm afraid to ask.

637
00:59:50,986 --> 00:59:52,738
Where's all this going?

638
00:59:53,946 --> 00:59:54,935
It's her.

639
00:59:56,786 --> 00:59:59,459
The woman I saw in the bathtub.

640
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:01,065
-The ghost?
-Yes, the ghost.

641
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:03,097
I thought it was Mrs. Feur,
but it's not.

642
01:00:03,306 --> 01:00:04,819
I'm positive this time.

643
01:00:05,026 --> 01:00:06,425
Claire, stop it!

644
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:08,545
Stop it.

645
01:00:11,266 --> 01:00:14,258
I know you're going through something
I don't understand.

646
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,418
I have tried to be here for you,
but this is enough, Claire.

647
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:20,900
Enough.

648
01:00:22,146 --> 01:00:24,455
Do you want to go see somebody
together?

649
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,464
I'll call Dr. Drayton.

650
01:00:29,106 --> 01:00:31,381
Then what, Claire? What?

651
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,577
Tell me what to do.

652
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:35,654
It's her.

653
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:40,541
So let me ask you this. . . .
Mr. McCain?

654
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:42,617
-McCann.
-McCann.

655
01:00:44,066 --> 01:00:48,184
Nothing was ever found?
No car, or. . .?

656
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:51,617
Listen....
This girl's a real live wire.

657
01:00:51,866 --> 01:00:55,779
She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.

658
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,419
Most people think she's...

659
01:00:57,626 --> 01:01:01,460
...off around Mexico or somewhere
with her friends.

660
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:04,863
The police downgraded it to a runaway.

661
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:09,744
Her mother lives out here
in Addison County.

662
01:01:11,346 --> 01:01:13,780
-Mrs. Frank?
-Yeah?

663
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:16,537
I'm Claire.

664
01:01:17,946 --> 01:01:20,858
I wanted to talk to you about Madison.

665
01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:23,222
Just plain coffee.

666
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:26,903
-None of that mocha nonsense.
-Fine.

667
01:01:28,866 --> 01:01:31,221
You look a little old for a student.

668
01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:34,975
I'm not a student. We met at a party.

669
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:38,100
Well, that sounds about right.

670
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:42,221
I never understood how a girl
that wild got all A's.

671
01:01:42,426 --> 01:01:44,382
She liked to read a lot, though.

672
01:01:44,586 --> 01:01:48,374
Sometimes she'd lock herself up
in her room for days, just reading.

673
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:54,223
They wanted to put her in a school
for the gifted when she was young.

674
01:01:55,026 --> 01:01:57,176
Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

675
01:01:58,066 --> 01:02:01,058
I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.

676
01:02:02,146 --> 01:02:05,297
She probably got it
from her father's side of the family.

677
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:10,016
She never really mentioned her father.

678
01:02:11,266 --> 01:02:12,858
Yeah, well, she wouldn't.

679
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:15,738
She was 1 2 when he left.

680
01:02:15,946 --> 01:02:18,141
Never spoke about him after that.

681
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:22,064
You don't even need the sound.

682
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:27,264
You can pretty much tell
what's happening by the faces.

683
01:02:29,146 --> 01:02:31,341
I turn it up sometimes, though.

684
01:02:32,026 --> 01:02:34,142
Feels like there's someone here.

685
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:38,865
Why are you here?

686
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:46,461
I don't know.

687
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:49,858
You want to see her room?

688
01:03:00,426 --> 01:03:02,018
Full scholarship.

689
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:04,105
Princeton too.

690
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:07,541
She wanted to stay on the East Coast.

691
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:10,782
You must be so proud.

692
01:03:14,986 --> 01:03:17,625
These are the last pictures
taken of her.

693
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:20,382
The police used this one.

694
01:03:21,986 --> 01:03:23,863
Let me get that. Excuse me.

695
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:42,375
Claire?

696
01:05:04,226 --> 01:05:05,295
Claire?

697
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:24,745
-Hello, Dr. Spencer.
-Mrs. Spencer.

698
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:28,745
Forbidden fruit.

699
01:05:32,106 --> 01:05:34,142
You got a problem with that?

700
01:06:24,906 --> 01:06:27,739
Guess this means you're not
mad at me anymore, huh?

701
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:29,824
I wouldn't go that far.

702
01:07:16,426 --> 01:07:18,417
Take it easy, huh?

703
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:25,498
What's got into you?

704
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:32,335
-Ow!
-What's the matter?

705
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:34,414
It's too rough.

706
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:36,301
Since when?

707
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,065
This is a brand-new--

708
01:07:55,586 --> 01:07:59,295
-Okay, Claire, that's--
-Why don't you shut up, professor?

709
01:08:00,786 --> 01:08:02,777
Why don't you just. . .

710
01:08:03,586 --> 01:08:05,338
. . .shut up?

711
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:22,580
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

712
01:09:23,186 --> 01:09:24,221
Who?

713
01:09:27,146 --> 01:09:28,056
Your wife.

714
01:09:29,786 --> 01:09:30,616
Stop it!

715
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:44,735
You know.

716
01:09:45,226 --> 01:09:46,454
What the hell are you doing?

717
01:09:47,546 --> 01:09:48,865
I know.

718
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:53,899
I was there.

719
01:09:56,746 --> 01:09:58,816
Just before the accident.

720
01:10:00,146 --> 01:10:01,295
I remember now.

721
01:10:02,186 --> 01:10:03,175
What?

722
01:10:04,186 --> 01:10:05,505
I came to the door.

723
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,305
There was whispering.

724
01:10:08,506 --> 01:10:11,339
I saw you in the mirror. . .

725
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:16,706
. . .Iying there with her. . .

726
01:10:16,906 --> 01:10:18,100
. . .in our house.

727
01:10:18,306 --> 01:10:20,103
Claire, listen to me.

728
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:21,785
She was at the DuPont party. . .

729
01:10:21,986 --> 01:10:24,341
. . .staring at me. It was her.

730
01:10:24,546 --> 01:10:26,138
That's why I couldn't breathe.

731
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:28,541
That's why I dropped the glass.

732
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:31,340
Honey, that was last year.
We were having troubles.

733
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:34,295
So you slept with a fucking student?

734
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:37,100
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Don't touch me.

735
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:38,981
Get away from me.

736
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:42,579
Get out!

737
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:45,145
I said, get out!

738
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:48,056
Fine.

739
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:51,139
Claire, please, please.

740
01:10:51,546 --> 01:10:53,343
I gave up everything.

741
01:10:53,546 --> 01:10:55,264
Claire, please don't. . . .

742
01:10:55,906 --> 01:10:58,739
-My life, my music.
-I never asked you to quit.

743
01:10:58,946 --> 01:11:01,141
There was never any other choice!

744
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:04,543
You had to topple perfect daddy.
That meant perfect wife.

745
01:11:04,786 --> 01:11:06,822
-Perfect family.
-That's not fair.

746
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:08,698
You were touring with a baby. . .

747
01:11:08,906 --> 01:11:10,817
. . .and you were happy to give it up.

748
01:11:11,026 --> 01:11:14,018
When you did, you hated me for it,
so you gave it all to her.

749
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:15,500
-Who?
-Caitlin!

750
01:11:15,746 --> 01:11:16,701
Leave her out of this.

751
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:20,057
And then some bright
young woman finds me attractive.

752
01:11:20,266 --> 01:11:22,063
-Stop it!
-And I slipped!

753
01:11:22,266 --> 01:11:24,382
-God help me, I slipped!
-I'm not gonna listen.

754
01:11:24,586 --> 01:11:29,023
-Claire, I tried to break it off.
-You should've tried harder.

755
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:38,777
I was in Adamant.

756
01:11:39,906 --> 01:11:40,941
In Adamant?

757
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:45,059
You know, that artsy little hippie
village a couple hours away down on 7.

758
01:11:45,266 --> 01:11:49,623
I stopped at this café to get coffee,
and I see Norman sitting in the back.

759
01:11:49,866 --> 01:11:51,140
But he wasn't alone.

760
01:11:52,466 --> 01:11:54,457
It was a young blond woman.

761
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,744
I didn't see her face.

762
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:58,978
I didn't think anything of it
at first.

763
01:11:59,186 --> 01:12:01,575
And I was walking over to say hello.

764
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:07,583
And they started arguing
in such a way. . .

765
01:12:09,026 --> 01:12:10,744
. . .that it stopped me.

766
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:15,456
Then a few days later,
you were in the accident.

767
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:18,976
And I get a bizarre call from Stan
working at the hospital. . .

768
01:12:19,186 --> 01:12:21,541
. . .asking me, was I with you that day?

769
01:12:21,786 --> 01:12:23,424
If you were upset about anything.

770
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:26,379
He made it sound
like you had deliberately. . .

771
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:28,019
. . .driven your car into a tree.

772
01:12:28,226 --> 01:12:30,262
And I thought, "Oh, my God.

773
01:12:30,466 --> 01:12:33,219
Claire's found out. "

774
01:12:33,426 --> 01:12:38,022
And when I went to the hospital,
I see Norman.

775
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:44,297
And he was so desperate
at the thought. . .

776
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,777
. . .of losing you.

777
01:12:50,226 --> 01:12:52,740
I couldn't say anything.

778
01:12:55,106 --> 01:12:56,619
Please. . .

779
01:12:59,506 --> 01:13:01,337
. . .don't hate me, Claire.

780
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,099
I don't hate you.

781
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,134
Hello, this is Miss Jody.

782
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:14,305
Can 't get to the phone. Leave your
name and I'll call you back.

783
01:13:14,826 --> 01:13:16,339
Jody, it's Norman.

784
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:19,657
I'm looking for Claire.
Will you please...

785
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:22,857
...ask her to call home, please?

786
01:13:27,186 --> 01:13:29,222
I can't talk to him.

787
01:13:31,546 --> 01:13:34,504
Will you call and tell him
I'll be home in the morning?

788
01:13:37,026 --> 01:13:39,096
I have to ask him something.

789
01:14:01,026 --> 01:14:02,300
Norman?

790
01:14:31,946 --> 01:14:33,140
Norman?

791
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:38,025
Norman!

792
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:42,259
Oh, God!

793
01:14:44,386 --> 01:14:46,502
-How's his blood pressure?
-1 40/80.

794
01:14:46,746 --> 01:14:50,056
-How about his rhythm?
-Rhythm is normal. Normal sinus.

795
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:51,984
-No sign of arrhythmia.
-Good.

796
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:54,575
Pulse/ox is normal.
His pupils were equal.

797
01:14:54,826 --> 01:14:56,498
I'd still like to take you down.

798
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:58,065
I'm fine, really.

799
01:14:58,266 --> 01:15:01,975
Dr. Powell, I'd recommend
a cardiac workup.

800
01:15:02,386 --> 01:15:06,220
-I'll take care of that.
-He needs to sign the release form.

801
01:15:06,426 --> 01:15:08,018
Thanks, guys.

802
01:15:08,226 --> 01:15:11,821
They can take you for a CAT scan
tomorrow if you start feeling dizzy.

803
01:15:12,026 --> 01:15:13,778
I'm not going to the hospital. . .

804
01:15:13,986 --> 01:15:16,500
. . .unless they have
a miracle drug for clumsiness.

805
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,498
Honey, I'm so sorry.

806
01:15:18,866 --> 01:15:20,618
Thank God you came home.

807
01:15:20,866 --> 01:15:22,379
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

808
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:24,941
You know, if that breaker
hadn't popped, he. . . .

809
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,295
I know.

810
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:28,780
Yeah, don't worry, Claire.

811
01:15:28,986 --> 01:15:31,898
You just keep him quiet tonight, okay?

812
01:15:32,106 --> 01:15:35,781
You might want to think twice
about keeping anything electrical. . .

813
01:15:35,986 --> 01:15:38,295
-. . .next to the tub.
-Oh, thank you.

814
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:41,862
Goodbye. Call me, okay?

815
01:16:13,106 --> 01:16:16,223
I called you last night.
I left a message on Jody's machine.

816
01:16:18,466 --> 01:16:20,775
I want you to answer one question.

817
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:27,334
Did you have anything to do
with her disappearance?

818
01:16:28,986 --> 01:16:29,896
Yes.

819
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:36,217
I had an affair with her.

820
01:16:38,866 --> 01:16:41,061
And when I tried to break it off. . .

821
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:43,781
. . .she became unstable.

822
01:16:46,306 --> 01:16:48,536
She came out here to the house.

823
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:52,182
She threatened to kill herself. . .

824
01:16:54,866 --> 01:16:56,060
. . .or you.

825
01:16:58,586 --> 01:17:01,817
I didn't think she'd
go through with any of it.

826
01:17:03,226 --> 01:17:04,545
But then she. . . .

827
01:17:06,306 --> 01:17:07,944
She disappeared.

828
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,019
It was her, Norman.

829
01:17:13,226 --> 01:17:14,625
She tried to kill you.

830
01:17:15,226 --> 01:17:16,818
-Claire.
-You said it yourself.

831
01:17:17,026 --> 01:17:18,618
She wanted you dead.

832
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:21,824
Are you saying I was attacked
by a ghost?

833
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,786
You had an affair with a girl. . .

834
01:17:24,986 --> 01:17:29,662
. . .who threatened to kill herself, and
now there's a presence in our house.

835
01:17:29,906 --> 01:17:33,103
A young, blond girl.

836
01:17:33,826 --> 01:17:35,225
Don't you get it?

837
01:17:35,586 --> 01:17:37,304
She did it, Norman.

838
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:38,814
She's dead. . .

839
01:17:39,106 --> 01:17:41,859
. . .and now she's trying to hurt you
or both of us.

840
01:17:42,066 --> 01:17:44,580
-You don't know that she's dead.
-Of course we do!

841
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,181
It's the only thing that makes--

842
01:17:49,826 --> 01:17:51,100
Oh, God.

843
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:54,741
It's my fault. I. . . .

844
01:17:55,306 --> 01:17:56,705
I opened the door.

845
01:17:56,906 --> 01:18:00,342
-Madison. I stole her hair.
-From where?

846
01:18:00,546 --> 01:18:02,616
-And it gave her power.
-Claire.

847
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:07,062
Nothing attacked me.
There are no ghosts.

848
01:18:07,746 --> 01:18:10,214
It was an accident. I'm fine.

849
01:18:10,626 --> 01:18:13,584
It's not your fault.
Are you listening to me?

850
01:18:14,186 --> 01:18:16,336
-Yes.
-Claire, say it.

851
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:19,538
Say it:
"lt was an accident.

852
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:21,299
It's not my fault. "

853
01:18:22,826 --> 01:18:24,498
Say it, Claire.

854
01:18:25,346 --> 01:18:27,655
I need to go lie down.

855
01:18:27,906 --> 01:18:31,296
I didn't sleep last night,
and I need to lie down.

856
01:18:33,906 --> 01:18:36,056
I want to be alone for a while.

857
01:18:55,786 --> 01:18:58,175
Hey, Teddy, it's me.
Right, yeah.

858
01:18:58,386 --> 01:19:02,265
What's the name of that friend of
yours? That who-you-gonna-call guy?

859
01:19:02,466 --> 01:19:05,663
The guy that does the paranormal
psych stuff?

860
01:19:05,986 --> 01:19:07,465
Holodnik.

861
01:19:09,066 --> 01:19:12,342
Could you contact him and ask him
to give me a call here?

862
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:15,265
I'd really like to talk to him today.

863
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:24,855
Hello.

864
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:27,065
Yes, this is he.

865
01:20:27,266 --> 01:20:29,097
Thanks for calling back.

866
01:20:30,906 --> 01:20:34,535
No, sir. That was my father.

867
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:39,655
Yeah, he passed away
a couple of years ago.

868
01:20:40,986 --> 01:20:42,624
Yes, he was. Thank you.

869
01:20:43,786 --> 01:20:46,254
Look, the reason I'm calling is. . . .

870
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:49,105
I'm a little out of my depth here.

871
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:52,378
Someone who is very close to me. . .

872
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:55,259
. . .believes herself to be
or seems to be. . .

873
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:57,422
. . .in contact with some kind of. . .

874
01:20:58,106 --> 01:21:00,495
. . .entity or spirit, and--

875
01:21:03,586 --> 01:21:05,975
No, there's no. . .

876
01:21:06,186 --> 01:21:08,495
. . .no history of delusional behavior.

877
01:21:11,506 --> 01:21:15,863
Well, I guess what I'm asking is,
is it possible that she could be. . .

878
01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:19,058
. . .causing these manifestations. . .

879
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:24,021
. . .through some kind of unconscious
or telekinetic--?

880
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,576
Is there anything else
that it could be?

881
01:21:37,946 --> 01:21:40,255
And this has been documented?

882
01:21:43,426 --> 01:21:44,461
Really?

883
01:21:47,226 --> 01:21:49,615
I'm sorry,
but could I call you back. . .

884
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:51,657
. . .or have you call me back?

885
01:21:51,986 --> 01:21:53,658
Please, yes, that'll be great.

886
01:21:54,146 --> 01:21:55,261
Thank you, sir.

887
01:21:59,146 --> 01:22:00,056
Claire!

888
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:02,140
You all right, Claire?

889
01:23:02,346 --> 01:23:03,415
The braid!

890
01:23:06,226 --> 01:23:07,454
Where's the braid?

891
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,338
What are you talking about?

892
01:23:10,746 --> 01:23:12,702
What are you talking about?
This?

893
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,862
Is this what you're talking about?

894
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:18,979
-Where'd you get this?
-I took it from Madison's house.

895
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:22,295
This is hers?

896
01:23:22,786 --> 01:23:24,777
This is Madison Frank's hair?

897
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,505
What do you think?

898
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:49,896
I really don't know.

899
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,174
Norman.

900
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:01,501
Yes. . .

901
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:04,819
. . .I believe you.

902
01:24:24,386 --> 01:24:25,535
Hey, Coop.

903
01:24:53,226 --> 01:24:54,454
You're playing.

904
01:24:57,186 --> 01:24:58,460
She's gone.

905
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:01,501
How do you know?

906
01:25:02,826 --> 01:25:04,384
I can feel it.

907
01:25:12,546 --> 01:25:15,299
I picked up the book you ordered
at the bookstore.

908
01:25:23,866 --> 01:25:27,415
Claire, I don't know how to apologize
to you for what I've done.

909
01:25:34,146 --> 01:25:36,262
But if you give me another chance. . .

910
01:25:38,386 --> 01:25:42,379
. . .I promise I'll spend the rest of my
life making you glad that you did.

911
01:25:55,426 --> 01:25:56,654
Please.

912
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:16,059
Last sail of the year.

913
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:17,858
Beautiful, isn't it?

914
01:26:18,346 --> 01:26:21,497
We ought to take a drive
before the leaves all disappear.

915
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:25,456
-Stay at a little bed-and-breakfast.
-Look for antiques.

916
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:27,816
Yeah, we haven't
done that for a while.

917
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,739
Adamant.

918
01:26:31,906 --> 01:26:35,376
-Adamant?
-An artsy little village down 7.

919
01:26:35,586 --> 01:26:37,577
Supposed to be charming.

920
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:40,535
-Do you know it?
-No.

921
01:26:42,306 --> 01:26:44,866
Maybe we'll stop there for lunch.

922
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:05,225
What's that for?

923
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,341
Nothing.

924
01:29:49,986 --> 01:29:51,658
God, oh, God. . . .

925
01:30:27,106 --> 01:30:29,301
You don't understand what that is.

926
01:30:30,906 --> 01:30:32,180
Don't l, Norman?

927
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:35,264
That's Madison's necklace.

928
01:30:38,626 --> 01:30:40,264
You killed her, didn't you?

929
01:30:41,546 --> 01:30:43,059
I did not.

930
01:30:44,346 --> 01:30:45,859
I didn't kill anyone.

931
01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:49,738
Jesus, Claire.

932
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:51,061
Listen to me.

933
01:30:52,506 --> 01:30:54,098
When I got here. . .

934
01:30:54,546 --> 01:30:58,300
. . .she was already dead. She killed
herself in our house to destroy me.

935
01:30:59,106 --> 01:31:00,619
Do you think I'm stupid?

936
01:31:01,026 --> 01:31:04,177
She left that for you in the garden,
with a letter.

937
01:31:04,386 --> 01:31:06,900
I burned the letter
and threw the box in the lake.

938
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:09,301
A week before. . .

939
01:31:10,186 --> 01:31:13,337
. . .she showed up at the DuPont party.

940
01:31:15,986 --> 01:31:17,260
I was terrified.

941
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:21,057
She insisted, so I agreed
to meet her here.

942
01:31:21,946 --> 01:31:23,095
When I got here. . .

943
01:31:23,306 --> 01:31:25,103
. . .she had taken pills.

944
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:28,456
I tried to revive her, but. . .

945
01:31:29,226 --> 01:31:30,944
. . .she was gone.

946
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:33,781
There was nothing I could do.

947
01:31:35,306 --> 01:31:38,298
So I put her in her car. . .

948
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,662
. . .and I drove to the boat ramp. . .

949
01:31:40,906 --> 01:31:44,023
. . .and I rolled it out into the lake.

950
01:31:44,826 --> 01:31:47,465
I made a terrible mistake.
I know that.

951
01:31:48,026 --> 01:31:49,459
But tell me, Claire.

952
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:52,544
What should I have done?
Should I sacrifice everything?

953
01:31:52,746 --> 01:31:54,338
Our marriage?

954
01:31:55,226 --> 01:31:58,343
My work,
which I spent my whole life on?

955
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,338
Tell me, Claire.

956
01:32:03,426 --> 01:32:06,498
Tell me, please. Because we can
put this behind us.

957
01:32:07,746 --> 01:32:08,781
Our life can go on.

958
01:32:08,986 --> 01:32:10,465
It's not too late.

959
01:32:13,746 --> 01:32:16,055
What are you asking me to do?

960
01:32:18,106 --> 01:32:20,666
I'm asking you to forgive me.

961
01:32:34,386 --> 01:32:36,377
That girl must be brought up.

962
01:33:06,026 --> 01:33:08,745
Hello. This is Dr. Norman Spencer.

963
01:33:09,266 --> 01:33:10,779
I have some information. . .

964
01:33:10,986 --> 01:33:12,817
. . .about a missing person.

965
01:33:13,226 --> 01:33:15,421
Madison Frank, yes.

966
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:19,779
Could you send an officer
out to the house, please?

967
01:33:22,306 --> 01:33:24,183
1 5 Willoughby Lane.

968
01:33:24,386 --> 01:33:26,456
It's about a mile from the bridge.

969
01:33:27,906 --> 01:33:29,021
Okay.

970
01:33:29,986 --> 01:33:31,260
Thank you.

971
01:33:45,026 --> 01:33:46,937
I'm gonna go get dressed.

972
01:35:48,186 --> 01:35:50,381
Information. What city?

973
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,894
Don't!

974
01:36:01,346 --> 01:36:02,256
Stop it!

975
01:37:01,986 --> 01:37:04,102
I begged you, Claire.

976
01:37:05,346 --> 01:37:07,462
I pleaded with you.

977
01:37:12,466 --> 01:37:14,377
But you wouldn't let it go.

978
01:37:18,106 --> 01:37:19,505
Oh, Claire.

979
01:37:22,226 --> 01:37:24,535
I never wanted any of this to happen.

980
01:37:26,506 --> 01:37:27,541
All I ever wanted. . .

981
01:37:29,306 --> 01:37:31,217
. . .was for you to love me.

982
01:37:32,906 --> 01:37:34,385
Be proud of me.

983
01:37:36,106 --> 01:37:37,505
To be happy.

984
01:37:40,346 --> 01:37:42,302
She was going to go to the dean.

985
01:37:43,026 --> 01:37:44,618
She would have ruined us.

986
01:37:46,146 --> 01:37:48,740
Did she think I was just
gonna sit there. . .

987
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:50,937
. . .and watch it happen?

988
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:57,735
You have no idea what it was like.

989
01:37:58,066 --> 01:37:59,977
Hold her underwater. . .

990
01:38:02,826 --> 01:38:05,101
. . .watch her life slip away.

991
01:38:11,946 --> 01:38:13,937
But she gave me no choice.

992
01:38:24,146 --> 01:38:25,579
And neither have you.

993
01:38:31,466 --> 01:38:34,583
I can't figure out
how you put it all together.

994
01:38:35,346 --> 01:38:37,302
At first I thought you knew.

995
01:38:37,546 --> 01:38:41,778
Thought you created the whole
ghost thing as an elaborate trap.

996
01:38:42,746 --> 01:38:44,941
Then I realized you believed it.

997
01:38:45,466 --> 01:38:48,583
It was a passive-aggressive
masterpiece.

998
01:38:52,746 --> 01:38:54,577
The first time I met you. . .

999
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:58,861
. . .all I ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1000
01:39:01,026 --> 01:39:03,062
It's not gonna happen now.

1001
01:39:36,546 --> 01:39:37,501
Too cold.

1002
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:42,179
I almost froze to death laying here. . .

1003
01:39:42,386 --> 01:39:45,856
. . .wet, naked, pretending to be
electrocuted.

1004
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:48,065
Hey, Coop.

1005
01:39:48,386 --> 01:39:50,775
How you doing? How you doing, boy?

1006
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:53,295
Let's go get your ball. Come on.

1007
01:40:11,786 --> 01:40:13,139
Jody, it's Norman.

1008
01:40:13,346 --> 01:40:15,337
If you're there, pick up, please.

1009
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:17,656
It's Norman.

1010
01:40:19,106 --> 01:40:20,505
Listen, Claire and l. . .

1011
01:40:21,986 --> 01:40:23,499
. . .had a terrible blowout.

1012
01:40:23,746 --> 01:40:25,065
Could you do me a favor?

1013
01:40:25,266 --> 01:40:28,497
I'm sleeping at the lab. Could
you check on her in the morning?

1014
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,619
I'm worried about her.

1015
01:40:32,386 --> 01:40:33,819
Thanks.

1016
01:40:56,866 --> 01:40:59,141
The halothane's starting to wear off.

1017
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:06,463
I'm sure in some. . .

1018
01:41:07,306 --> 01:41:10,184
. . .tragic way,
your suicide is gonna. . .

1019
01:41:10,906 --> 01:41:13,864
. . .help bring Caitlin and I
closer together.

1020
01:41:16,786 --> 01:41:18,663
And every time I look at her. . .

1021
01:41:20,306 --> 01:41:21,455
. . .I'll see you.

1022
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,224
Oh, God.

1023
01:41:52,906 --> 01:41:53,861
What's this?

1024
01:52:57,306 --> 01:52:58,580
Oh, shit.

1025
01:53:13,226 --> 01:53:15,217
I'm on the bridge!

1026
01:53:15,746 --> 01:53:17,065
Somebody help me!

1027
01:53:18,826 --> 01:53:19,941
I'm on the bridge!

1028
01:53:56,786 --> 01:53:58,299
No!

1029
01:54:46,986 --> 01:54:48,977
I beg you. . .

1030
01:54:49,186 --> 01:54:50,460
. . .think of Caitlin.

1031
01:54:50,666 --> 01:54:52,622
Please, don't. Please.
