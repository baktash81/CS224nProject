1
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:32,597
Everyone has a dream that
fills their heart

2
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,433
a journey they must take

3
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:37,099
a destiny to fulfill.

4
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,472
As close as your imagination

5
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,238
exists a magical place

6
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:43,940
where wondrous creatures
with incredible powers

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,811
help make dreams come true.

8
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,816
It's the world of Pokémon.

9
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:26,086
People can capture Pokémon
to be more than just pets.

10
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:27,749
Human trainers
and their Pokémon

11
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,726
compete against others
in amazing contests

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,591
of skill and strategy.

13
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:36,929
The best trainers one day become
Pokémon masters.

14
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,765
That's a dream that
burns brightly for many...

15
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:42,772
but none more so
than Ash Ketchum.

16
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:47,437
The pride of Pallet Town
began his Pokémon journey

17
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:49,206
on his tenth birthday.

18
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:52,841
That's the day he qualified
to become a Pokémon trainer.

19
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,579
Professor Oak gave Ash
his very first Pokéball.

20
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,747
Inside was
an electric Pokémon

21
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:02,451
with whom Ash would spark
a lifelong friendship--Pikachu.

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,625
Together, Ash and Pikachu
are determined

23
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,254
to fulfill his dream...

24
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,731
of becoming the world's
greatest Pokémon master.

25
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,757
Joining them on their quest
are Misty

26
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,462
and yours truly, Brock...

27
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:16,495
in the incredible world
of Pokémon.

28
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:19,235
Huh?

29
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,361
Ohh.

30
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,607
If you're going in,
be careful.

31
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:30,670
Huh?

32
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,017
Don't forget--if you hear
the Voice of the Forest...

33
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,078
don't move a muscle.

34
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,089
Huh?

35
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:41,988
Don't tell me
you haven't heard about it.

36
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:43,049
No, I haven't.

37
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:44,560
What's the Voice
of the Forest?

38
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:45,925
Well, it's only a legend...

39
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:48,362
but everyone around here
believes it.

40
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:50,491
They say there's a sound
you can hear...

41
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,228
when the spirit
that protects the forest...

42
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,360
is time-traveling.

43
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:54,870
Time-traveling?

44
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,701
That's one of
its special powers.

45
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,005
It can go back and forth
between the past and the future.

46
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,408
Wow.

47
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,344
So if you hear
a weird sound...

48
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,473
Stop and stay
completely still.

49
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:06,880
If the spirit
catches you...

50
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,907
it could carry you off
to a different time.

51
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:10,715
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.

52
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:11,812
Mm.

53
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:13,322
Thanks. Bye.

54
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:15,515
Wait.

55
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:16,718
Huh?

56
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,962
Take this. It's a loaf
of bread I made

57
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:23,556
that's full of berries
from the forest.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,431
It might come in handy
if you get hungry.

59
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,733
Here.

60
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,898
Thanks, Miss.
I appreciate it.

61
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,065
Bye.

62
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:11,137
So...

63
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,678
You've been givin' me
the slip for a long time...

64
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,082
but you won't today.

65
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:24,451
Don't let it get away!
Let's go!

66
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:36,472
Huh?

67
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,382
Whoa!

68
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,754
Huh? Uhh!

69
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:57,682
Huh.

70
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,261
Uhh!

71
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:09,227
Huh?

72
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:14,702
Let it go!

73
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,211
Two against one isn't fair!

74
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:18,638
Aah!

75
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,683
Huh?

76
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:37,528
All right,
hand over that Celebi.

77
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,091
Celebi?

78
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,534
Why should I hand it over?
What do you want with it?

79
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,369
I'm a Pokémon hunter, kid.

80
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,705
I make good money
off of rare Pokémon.

81
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,711
First I catch 'em,
then I auction 'em off

82
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:49,939
to the highest bidders.

83
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,379
Well, you're not gonna get
your hands on this Pokémon!

84
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,541
Give it to me!

85
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,676
No! Go away!

86
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:21,069
Could that be time-traveling?

87
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:23,077
Uhh.

88
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:24,374
Uhh.

89
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,245
Huh?

90
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:35,249
Ohh!

91
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,232
I'll tell you why I'm here.

92
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,467
Uhh!

93
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,202
I'm here
because I heard a story...

94
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:27,834
that you almost
caught a Celebi...

95
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:30,903
somewhere in this forest
about 40 years ago--true?

96
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:33,040
I'm still a Pokémon hunter!

97
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:35,016
I'm not gonna tell you anything!

98
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,815
Heh heh.
We'll see about that.

99
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,155
Uhh!

100
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:48,288
OK.

101
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,573
What's that thing?

102
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:02,805
A Dark Ball.

103
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:03,903
What's it do?

104
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:06,176
Allow me to demonstrate.

105
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:07,204
Uhh!

106
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:14,755
The Pokémon I catch
with the Dark Ball...

107
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,349
become evil Pokémon...

108
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:20,089
and their power instantly
increases to the highest level.

109
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:22,563
Come on out, Tyranitar!

110
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,169
Hyper Beam Attack!

111
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,088
No, please!

112
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,030
It's gonna destroy everything!

113
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:57,123
Uhh!

114
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,135
Aah! Aah! All right!
All right!

115
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,228
I'll show you!
I'll show you the spot...

116
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,034
where I found that Celebi!

117
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,700
Heh heh heh heh heh.

118
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:08,108
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

119
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:09,941
<i>Ha ha ha ha ha ha</i>!

120
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:12,971
I thought you'd
see it my way.

121
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,912
Today we find our friends

122
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,781
waiting for a ferry
that will carry them

123
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,514
to yet another Pokémon gym

124
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:54,114
as they continue
their Johto League journey.

125
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:55,784
Brock and Misty are ready...

126
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,123
the passengers
are hurrying aboard...

127
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,891
and it's almost time
for the boat to leave.

128
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,693
But where are
Ash and Pikachu?

129
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,560
Well, if they don't come soon
they're gonna miss the boat.

130
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:09,302
Crobat, go!

131
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,040
My name's Dundee...

132
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,741
and I'm the best Pokémon
trainer in the whole town.

133
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:20,942
Well, my name's Ash...

134
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,645
and I'm a pretty good
Pokémon trainer, too.

135
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,314
Why don't you pick a Pokémon,
and we can have a battle.

136
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,017
Croconaw, go!

137
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:34,924
A Croconaw, huh?

138
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,023
Never battled
one of those before.

139
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,762

you're all...

181
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:07,541
pretty interested
in Pokémon, huh?

182
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,607
Yeah.

183
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,516
I come from a place
just up the river

184
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,020
and a lot
of real unusual ones

185
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,521
Iive in the forest nearby.

186
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,183
Hey, if you could show us
where it is

187
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:16,816
maybe we could stop
and check it out.

188
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,622
No problem.
We can get off

189
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:19,992
at the next stop,
and I'll take you

190
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,462
the rest of the way
in my boat.

191
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:23,055
Great. Thanks.

192
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,567
Huh?

193
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,932
Ohh.

194
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,562
Hey, was that a Pokémon?

195
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,005
Looked like one to me.

196
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,340
You'll see the woods
around here are full of them.

197
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,543
There's one more possibility.

198
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,244
Did it look
anything like this?

199
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:44,309
Yeah, that's it, Professor.

200
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,546
It was a Suicune.

201
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:47,749
A Suicune?

202
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,553
What kind of Pokémon
is that, Professor?

203
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,526
It's one of the legendary
Pokémon, Brock...

204
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,050
and not very much
is known about it.

205
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:54,790
And according
to folk tales

206
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,957
Suicune personifies
the north wind

207
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,864
and it's believed
to have the power

208
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,664
to purify tainted waters.

209
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,933
Wow, I hope I get
to see Suicune again.

210
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:05,372
It sounds like
it's a pretty cool one.

211
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:07,171
Believe you me, kids

212
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,541
those tales
are definitely true.

213
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:12,206
Really? How do you know that
for sure, Professor?

214
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:14,409
Have you ever seen
a Suicune before?

215
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,214
Yes, I sure have,
but only one time.

216
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,515
ASH: Wow! Where?

217
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,681
Hey, Ash, come on!

218
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:21,985
We've gotta go!

219
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,252
OK!

220
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,055
Uh, bye, Professor.

221
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:39,708
I wonder if I should've told him
before he hung up.

222
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,209
Hmm.

223
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,171
The quicker we get
into that forest

224
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:48,274
the quicker we can look
for those Pokémon.

225
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,251
Maybe even that Suicune.

226
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,823
Those twerps won't get away now.

227
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,155
They're right beneath us.

228
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:59,127
Of course, they're
beneath us. They're twerps.

229
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,994
Now all we do is
swoop in and swipe Pikachu.

230
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,056
Uh-oh. Something's wrong
with my leg.

231
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,795
All this pedaling
is giving me a cramp.

232
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:06,859
Oh! Ow!

233
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:09,462
Aah! You can't cramp!
We'll crash!

234
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,648
All right.

235
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:30,716
What do we do now?

236
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,751
Don't worry, Misty.
You'll see.

237
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:34,930
Whoa.

238
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:52,748
Ha ha ha!

239
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:00,078
Well, we're here.

240
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:02,352
Here? Where?

241
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:03,858
Look closer.

242
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:06,658
Tree houses?

243
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:11,225
That's right, Brock.
Welcome to Arborville.

244
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:27,007
Whoa.

245
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,483
Stop right there!

246
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,919
Huh?

247
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,080
I suppose you kids
are heading into the forest

248
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,490
to look for Pokémon.

249
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:39,016
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,086
Then you're gonna love
what you see in there.

251
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,496
I love what I see here!
My name's Brock

252
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:45,329
and I'm studying to
become a Pokémon breeder

253
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,392
but my specialty
is human relations.

254
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:48,368
Oh?

255
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:49,837
Please tell me your name!

256
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:52,500
My name's Diana,
and that's my grandma.

257
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,133
She's been guarding
the entrance to the forest

258
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,404
since she was my age.

259
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,412
Listen for The Voice
of the Forest

260
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,846
and if you hear it,
stop and be still

261
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:01,850
or you will not get away.

262
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:03,351
The Voice of the Forest?

263
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:05,012
It's an old village legend.

264
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:07,079
Yes, it's a legend,
and a true one.

265
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:09,420
If you hear The Voice,
stop where you are.

266
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,720
Uh, we gotta hurry

267
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,886
but thanks a lot for
the warning, ma'am.

268
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,861
Diana, why don't you
come, too, and protect us?

269
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,060
Then she'd need
protection from you.

270
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:30,138
I wonder what Diana's
grandmother meant

271
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,374
by "The voice of the forest".

272
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:34,712
Maybe the sound of the wind
or the trees

273
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,617
the water, or maybe
the voices of the Pokémon.

274
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,388
Ohh. I wonder what that is.

275
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:45,825
Maybe it's The Voice
of the Forest.

276
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:46,855
Come on!

277
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,120
Ash, no!

278
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:50,222
Hey, shouldn't we stand still?

279
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,234
Uh...wait up!

280
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,557
Hey, it's a kid.

281
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:23,122
Is he OK?

282
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,189
He's still breathing.

283
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,530
Yeah.

284
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,000
Let's take him back
to Diana's house.

285
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,060
Good idea.

286
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,263
Yeah.

287
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:33,536
I wonder what
that light was.

288
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,811
Hey! Diana!

289
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:41,247
Diana! We need help!

290
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,649
Oh, dear. What's happened?

291
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:47,081
Hey, Ash, he's waking up.

292
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,718
Take it easy.
You're gonna be OK.

293
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,290
Uhh.

294
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:56,488
Uhh!

295
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,830
What'd you do with that Celebi?

296
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:01,497
Hey, I'm trying to help you!

297
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:03,300
That's enough, you two.
Knock it off.

298
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,397
Settle down!

299
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,873
Who are you anyway?

300
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:06,932
Huh?

301
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,944
Where am l?

302
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:10,605
How'd I get here?

303
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,807
I carried you here
on my back, that's how!

304
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,076
What's going on?

305
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,413
We found him unconscious...

306
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,442
when we were out
in the forest.

307
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:18,453
Oh!

308
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:20,512
Oh-oh-oh!

309
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:22,990
I can't believe it.
It's really you.

310
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:23,992
Huh?

311
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,425
You've come back.

312
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,895
Oh, thank goodness!

313
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,897
Uh, Grandma...

314
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:31,024
where did he
come back from?

315
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,931
Diana, I've told you
the story...

316
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:35,027
about what happened
when I was a young girl.

317
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,368
A little boy disappeared
from the forest.

318
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,636
But this boy can't be him.

319
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,336
Well... maybe it can't be

320
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,038
-but it <i>is</i>.
-Huh?

321
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:48,911
Ah! You're the girl...

322
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:51,044
who gave me
the loaf of bread.

323
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,576
Yes.

324
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,752
Here.

325
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,090
I've kept this all these years
in case you ever came back.

326
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,434
This is my sketchbook.
How--

327
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:08,595
You've been away...

328
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:10,901
on a 40-year-long journey,
young man.

329
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,133
40 years?

330
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:13,334
What do you mean?

331
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,933
The legend says
The Voice of the Forest

332
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:17,741
can catch a person and take them
on a trip through time.

333
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,771
-Huh?
-Through time?

334
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,266
Uhh!

335
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,665
Where's Celebi?

336
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,168
What happened to Celebi?

337
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:42,227
Celebi?

338
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:44,535
BOY: Was there a Pokémon
with me in the forest?

339
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:46,302
We didn't see any.

340
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:48,775
The Pokémon you met
that day was a Celebi?

341
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:50,176
Yes.

342
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:52,772
We know Celebi
as The Voice of the Forest...

343
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:54,908
the spirit that protects it.

344
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,043
They say that Celebi
can travel through time.

345
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:58,576
You two must've been
in danger

346
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,212
and Celebi just picked
the fastest way

347
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,313
to get you out of it.

348
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,846
BROCK: It's must've
escaped to the future

349
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,222
and taken you along with it.

350
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,521
I'm afraid you're right.

351
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,359
Celebi lives
deep in the forest

352
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:11,195
in a place we call
"The Lake of Life".

353
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:14,066
That's probably where
it's gone back to now.

354
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,867
I've got a feeling Celebi
still may be hurt.

355
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:20,408
I have to go back into
that forest and find Celebi.

356
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:21,466
I'll go, too!

357
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,534
Me, too!

358
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:23,602
So will l!

359
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:25,872
My name's Brock

360
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:27,245
and I'm a Pokémon breeder.

361
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:28,271
I'm Sam.

362
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:29,284
And I'm Misty.

363
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:31,582
My specialty is water Pokémon.

364
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,882
My name's Ash Ketchum

365
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:34,980
and I'm trying
to be a Pokémon master.

366
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,093
Oh, yeah,
and this is Pikachu.

367
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,454
Hi, Pikachu. I'm Sam.

368
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,092
Our glider didn't
glide very well...

369
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:47,967
Next time we spring
for a motor.

370
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,971
I wonder where
those twerps are.

371
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:52,337
We may never know.
Huh?

372
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:53,363
-Huh?
-Huh?

373
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:55,933
Well, well.

374
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,673
I can't believe my eyes.

375
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,146
Looks like it's a good thing

376
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:00,910
we crashed after
all, eh, Meowth?

377
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:03,042
Come on, let's get down
and tail them twerps!

378
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:13,522
Guys, look up there!

379
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:22,400
The pokémon are
all together.

380
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,898
I'm coming, too!

381
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,514
Ash climbs just like a Mankey.

382
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:39,682
Aah!

383
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:45,454
Sam, maybe you should wait
down with Brock and Misty.

384
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:47,553
No. I have to find Celebi.

385
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,325
I couldn't
protect it before...

386
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:50,854
so I've gotta help it now.

387
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:57,167
I know how you feel, Sam,
but take it easy.

388
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,377
Uh. Ah!

389
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:16,313
Hey.

390
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:17,620
Is this the Celebi?

391
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:18,626
Mm-hmm.

392
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,957
Come on, Celebi.

393
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:25,866
Whoa! Unh!

394
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:28,199
Hey! What'd you do that for?

395
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:33,133
I think Ash just evolved
into a Primeape.

396
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:34,904
We're only trying to help you.

397
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:38,871
Whoa!

398
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,882
What's going on?

399
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:45,117
No, Pikachu, don't!

400
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:47,720
Don't be mad at it.

401
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:49,314
It's just afraid...

402
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:50,723
and it's hurt, too.

403
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,226
A hunter attacked it.

404
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:53,660
That's why it's scared.

405
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:55,754
OK. Here goes.

406
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,498
Celebi, we're your friends.

407
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:03,333
We don't want to hurt you.

408
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:04,839
We just want to help you.

409
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,736
I tried to help you before.

410
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:10,642
Don't you remember, Celebi?

411
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,647
I got you away
from the Pokémon hunter.

412
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,080
It's OK.

413
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:19,816
You just take it easy.

414
00:25:19,855 --> 00:25:21,447
And we will, too.

415
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,889
There...

416
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:30,864
Uh...

417
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,628
Ha ha!

418
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:44,944
You're safe with me, Celebi.

419
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:55,822
Brock, it seems really weak.

420
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:57,688
Yeah, we better hurry.

421
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:59,318
We'll take it
to a Pokémon center.

422
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:01,852
Who are they?

423
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:04,491
Prepare for trouble.
Your future looks grim.

424
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,831
And we're not afraid
to go out on a limb.

425
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:09,336
To protect the world
from devastation.

426
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:11,839
To unite all peoples
within our nation.

427
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:14,501
To denounce the evils
of truth and love.

428
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:16,841
To eexend our reach
to the stars above.

429
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,140
Jessie.

430
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,306
James.

431
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:20,645
Team Rocket...

432
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:22,377
blast off
at the speed of light.

433
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:26,152
Surrender now
or prepare to fight.

434
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:27,883
Meowth--that's right.

435
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:31,685
Aah!

436
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:34,028
Hmm.

437
00:26:34,062 --> 00:26:35,529
Do you think
they're gonna be OK?

438
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,031
Unfortunately, yes.

439
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:38,327
Hmm.

440
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,392
You twerps got lucky this time.

441
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:42,335
They're always lucky.

442
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:47,070
Don't press your luck, blubbo.

443
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:49,533
Hang in there, Celebi.

444
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,809
Look, that's
the village up there!

445
00:26:54,616 --> 00:26:56,550
Aah!

446
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:59,850
I've been looking
for that little Celebi.

447
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:01,116
Who are you?

448
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,748
A Pokémon lover.

449
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:03,951
Leave us alone!

450
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:06,893
What does he want?

451
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:09,726
He must be trying to steal
our Pikachu away.

452
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:11,392
Well, we won't let him!

453
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:20,536
Huhh!

454
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,839
What's that?

455
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:27,075
A Tyranitar...

456
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:28,582
but there's something
funny about it.

457
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:29,845
Hyper-beam!

458
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:39,855
Here it comes!

459
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:48,801
Two can play
the Celebi-stealing game.

460
00:27:58,113 --> 00:27:59,944
Who are you three?

461
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:01,448
Look at that mask.

462
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:02,677
I've seen him before.

463
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:05,311
Yeah, wasn't he in
that Mexican wrestling movie?

464
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:07,321
No, Meowth,
he's from Team Rocket.

465
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,448
The lron Mask Marauder!

466
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:11,652
So you heard about me.

467
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:12,819
Yeah!

468
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:14,590
Oh, yes, we've heard
a lot about you.

469
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:16,028
As you can tell
from the uniforms...

470
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:18,055
we're also members
of Team Rocket.

471
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,033
Me, too, but Pokémon
get to go naked.

472
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:23,629
Go!

473
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:35,310
Aah.

474
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,317
Misty!

475
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:39,013
Ash!
I think Misty's hurt.

476
00:28:39,054 --> 00:28:42,182
Brock, I twisted my knee.

477
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:43,987
You better stay off it.

478
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,854
Something's coming!

479
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:55,931
What are they doing here?

480
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:57,529
They must want Celebi.

481
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,803
All right, then they're
in for a battle.

482
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:03,470
Brock, take care of Celebi.

483
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:04,501
Right.

484
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:07,511
All right,
I'm with you, Ash. Ready?

485
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,847
Uh...

486
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,024
Go!

487
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:30,371
Quick, Bayleef,
use your razor leaf!

488
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,021
Are you OK?

489
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,857
Ash, you gotta find
the real one.

490
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,453
It's using double team.

491
00:29:55,497 --> 00:29:56,623
Mm.

492
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,929
Bayleef, listen,
you gotta concentrate!

493
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:00,901
Then you can find the real one!

494
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:17,547
Yeah, Bayleef, you did it!

495
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:19,213
You're a great trainer, Ash.

496
00:30:19,254 --> 00:30:21,347
Well, it helps
when you have great Pokémon.

497
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:23,749
Look out. Sneasel!

498
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:28,152
Charmeleon, use head butt!

499
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,826
Hey, you're not
a bad trainer yourself.

500
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,393
We make a good team.

501
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,086
Those kids aren't as wimpy
as I thought they'd be.

502
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,987
This makes things interesting.

503
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,738
We gotta find the way out.

504
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:17,477
This is getting bad.

505
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:25,786
We better keep moving forward.

506
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,720
If we stop now,
we might be too late.

507
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,018
Huh?

508
00:31:32,661 --> 00:31:34,390
It's Ursaring.

509
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:35,623
Huh?

510
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,827
Oh...

511
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,167
What are they doing?

512
00:31:43,204 --> 00:31:45,604
I think they're telling us
to follow them.

513
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:48,670
Should we?

514
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,938
Yeah.

515
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,114
Hey, do you think this
could be The Lake of Life

516
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:03,709
that Diana's grandmother
was talking about?

517
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,022
Hey, Sam, look.

518
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,424
Huh? Uh--

519
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:43,476
Look, guys, Celebi's swimming.

520
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:44,815
And it's glowing.

521
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,888
This must be the Lake of Life.

522
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,822
Hey, that's it!
The lake water

523
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:51,792
must have brought
Celebi back to life.

524
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,815
Oh.

525
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:57,156
Ha ha.

526
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:05,039
Celebi!

527
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:06,040
All right!

528
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:10,506
Ha ha ha.

529
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:29,361
Whoa.

530
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:31,228
All right, then!

531
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:32,961
Let's do it!

532
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:34,400
Yeah!

533
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,479
Mm! Mm!

534
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:02,127
Mm! Mm!

535
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,460
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

536
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:14,975
All right!

537
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:22,616
Oh.

538
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,015
Hey!

539
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:25,986
Heh heh.

540
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:29,618
My knee's better.

541
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,215
Thanks, Celebi!

542
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,697
Hi! Hey, you guys!

543
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,870
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

544
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,273
This is great!

545
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:49,435
Oh...

546
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:54,040
There's the village
over there.

547
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:18,095
Huh?

548
00:37:20,408 --> 00:37:22,842
Awesome!
These are really good.

549
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:24,538
Yeah?

550
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,472
Ah, you're right.

551
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,550
Huh.

552
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:32,348
Mmm, they're tasty.

553
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:33,684
They're delicious.

554
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:39,522
I'm gonna keep some for later.

555
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:41,960
Thanks for taking us here,
Celebi.

556
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:43,520
Yeah.

557
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,031
These are good ones.

558
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:46,897
Have some, Celebi.

559
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,851
Don't you worry.
We'll find Celebi.

560
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:08,822
I'd rather find some lunch.

561
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,016
So would l.

562
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:11,320
Or a bathroom.

563
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,348
-Huh?
-Huh?

564
00:38:14,395 --> 00:38:15,623
Lucky us!

565
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:16,857
It's a peach tree!

566
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,800
Grab that big one there, Meowth.

567
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:21,859
You got it, Jessie!

568
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:23,871
Eee!

569
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:31,071
Ah! Ah!

570
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,443
-Hey!
-Hey!

571
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,716
Nice catch.

572
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,153
It was peachy.

573
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:43,615
Huh?

574
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,525
There goes our driver!

575
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:49,757
Wait! Come back!
Don't leave us!

576
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,788
We'll even chip in for gas!

577
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:09,683
Sammy, it's the middle
of the night.

578
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,617
I know, but I can't sleep.

579
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,321
Hey, that's great.

580
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,156
Thanks. When I meet
a new Pokémon...

581
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,821
I sketch him in this book.

582
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:23,160
Can I take a look?

583
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,357
Mm-hmm.

584
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,027
Hmm.

585
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:32,335
Oh, these are amazing!

586
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:34,603
This is like
a handmade Pokédex.

587
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:37,338
That's this machine that
has pictures of Pokémon.

588
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:39,972
I guess you know a lot
about the future, huh, Ash?

589
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:42,278
At least more than I do.

590
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:44,546
Yeah, I guess so...

591
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:47,577
but I'm sure glad I'm not stuck
in it like you are.

592
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:51,225
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

593
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:03,795
Hey, I didn't mean
to make you feel bad, Sam.

594
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:05,203
Honest, I didn't.

595
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,536
That's OK.

596
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,474
I think I'll like
living in the future...

597
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,306
but it'll take
some getting used to.

598
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:11,675
Yeah. Probably.

599
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,738
But then I think about my mother
worrying about me...

600
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,773
and wondering where I am.

601
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:18,842
And I wonder
if she still wonders.

602
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:23,421
Oh. Yeah, me, too.

603
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:25,652
Hey, what about your mom, Ash?

604
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:27,422
I bet she worries about you...

605
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,452
when you're out on
your Pokémon journey.

606
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:32,193
Yeah, she worries, I guess.

607
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:35,766
Maybe that's just what moms do.

608
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:36,770
Mm.

609
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,301
Thinking about my mom

610
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:42,138
gets me thinking
about her cooking.

611
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:43,575
Hey, I have something.

612
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:44,703
Huh?

613
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,714
Diana's grandmother made this...

614
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,948
but that was about
40 years ago.

615
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,854
Still looks
pretty fresh, though.

616
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,859
-Mm.
-Mm.

617
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,190
It's great!

618
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:02,219
Tastes like it was
made yesterday.

619
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,935
What's the matter, Pikachu?

620
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,273
Hey, Ash, look.

621
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,299
Huh?

622
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:22,883
Oh.

623
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:23,906
Oh.

624
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,889
Oh, cool.

625
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:39,832
Wow.

626
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:46,005
Look at all the Butterfree.

627
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,104
I hope you'll be free, Sam.

628
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:50,110
Huh?

629
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:51,975
I mean, to go back in time.

630
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:52,980
Oh.

631
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:04,080
-Oh.
-Oh.

632
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:06,817
Wait for me!

633
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,899
Ah. Whoa.

634
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:24,342
Oh, cool.

635
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:58,237
Well, the village
is real close now.

636
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,347
Look!

637
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:12,024
Thought you'd gotten
rid of us...

638
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,617
didn't you, twerps?

639
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,891
But Team Rocket doesn't
give up so easily!

640
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,420
Not you again.

641
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,358
All right...

642
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:24,428
we ain't leaving
without that Celebi.

643
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:32,107
Nice try!

644
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,747
Oh!

645
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:47,117
Celebi!

646
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:51,231
This ought to calm you down.

647
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,658
Hey!

648
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:04,411
Dark Ball, go!

649
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:09,575
-Aah!
-Aah!

650
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:14,783
Celebi is mine.

651
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:16,619
Let it go!

652
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:22,161
Stupid kids.

653
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:24,096
Aah! Hey! Aah!

654
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:45,549
-Whoa!
-Aah!

655
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:51,823
Don't worry. I got ya.

656
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,019
Aah!

657
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,552
I think that Dark Ball
belongs to me.

658
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,360
Aah--aah!

659
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:09,409
Ash!

660
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:12,308
Huh?

661
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,723
Don't waste your time.

662
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:26,749
It's too late to save
your friend Celebi.

663
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,900
Because the sweet little
Pokémon you used to know...

664
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:37,927
doesn't exist anymore.

665
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:39,530
Here, see for yourself!

666
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:48,472
Celebi, get rid of them all!

667
00:45:58,292 --> 00:45:59,816
Aah!

668
00:46:18,746 --> 00:46:20,008
I don't understand.

669
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:23,278
If Celebi's their friend,
I'd hate to see their enemies.

670
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:25,046
Excellent.

671
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,553
You're very strong, Celebi.

672
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:31,251
Now show me even
more of your power!

673
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:44,894
With a Pokémon like you,
no one will ever stop me!

674
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:47,134
Celebi...

675
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:55,812
Celebi's building a nasty nest.

676
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,476
Oh, no!

677
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:09,329
Oh.

678
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:11,354
Oh, what is that?

679
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:12,422
I don't know.

680
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,660
Grandma.

681
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:15,328
We'd better go find out.

682
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,563
Right.

683
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:20,235
Mm...uhh.

684
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:21,332
Uhh!

685
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,275
Celebi! Uhh!

686
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,641
I've gotta--

687
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:25,940
Uhh!

688
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,277
Take it easy, Ash.

689
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:29,475
You might be hurt.

690
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,017
Hey!

691
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,852
Hi, guys! Just stay
right where you are.

692
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,017
We're coming down to get you!

693
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,924
Diana!

694
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:43,293
I can't believe
tget found us!

695
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:15,957
Uhh, this is awful.

696
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,964
Forcing the Spirit
of the Forest

697
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:19,761
to destroy the forest.

698
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,200
This is just despicable.

699
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:27,038
Do you think Jessie's
going to be all right?

700
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:30,339
Yeah, but I ain't so sure
about Celebi...

701
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:46,954
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

702
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:49,394
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Masked Person...

703
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,022
but could you let me
out of here?

704
00:48:51,065 --> 00:48:55,297
Not yet. I need a witness who
can report back to Giovanni.

705
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:57,394
I want the head
of Team Rocket to know

706
00:48:57,438 --> 00:48:59,702
just how powerful Celebi is...

707
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,038
and how powerful <i>I</i> am, too.

708
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:05,477
Celebi, the time has come!

709
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,398
Ha ha ha ha ha!

710
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:07,531
I'm very impressed.

711
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:10,168
You and Celebi
are extremely powerful!

712
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,700
Now just get me down
from here...

713
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:13,713
and I'll recommend you
for a big promotion

714
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:15,874
when you give Celebi
to the boss.

715
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,315
Ha ha ha ha ha!

716
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:21,151
I control the most powerful
Pokémon in the world!

717
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:23,486
Why would I want to give
something that valuable

718
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:24,684
to the boss?

719
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:25,987
What do you mean?

720
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:28,586
Now the boss
has to be afraid of me...

721
00:50:28,629 --> 00:50:31,757
because Celebi gives me
the power to destroy him!

722
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:34,495
With Celebi,
I can rule Team Rocket...

723
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,003
and the whole world,
if I want to!

724
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:41,371
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

725
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:42,932
What is that?

726
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:45,342
The evil Celebi
must've created it.

727
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,017
Celebi!

728
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:02,021
Oh, you again.

729
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:04,223
Celebi, get rid of 'em now!

730
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:11,104
Celebi!

731
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:12,435
Hold on! Uhh!

732
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:46,662
Is everybody OK?

733
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:47,935
I think so.

734
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,203
I'm still alive.

735
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:50,301
Me, too.

736
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:51,333
So am l.

737
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,169
Grandma!

738
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:57,445
I'm alive, too, but just barely.

739
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:58,644
Hmm.

740
00:51:58,685 --> 00:52:02,052
We have to <i>stop</i>
that horrible thing.

741
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:08,292
We're no match for
that big twig monster.

742
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:09,761
I know.

743
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:11,320
Poor Jessie.

744
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:19,201
All right, Pikachu,
try a Thunder Bolt.

745
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:27,107
Celebi, get rid
of these children!

746
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,522
Celebi, do it now!

747
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,892
Huh?

748
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:00,272
The north wind.

749
00:53:00,314 --> 00:53:02,043
The north wind saved them.

750
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:03,344
Suicune!

751
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:09,445
Uhh! Uhh!

752
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:10,513
Aah!

753
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:13,448
Hmm.

754
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:16,553
You must've come here
to help us out.

755
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:21,066
Then we need you to take us
to Celebi right away!

756
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:26,234
Heh heh heh heh.
Now's my chance

757
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:28,298
to capture a Suicune, too!

758
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,818
Tyranitar, Hyper Beam!

759
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:41,343
We've gotta stop him!

760
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:42,821
Go, Onix! Uhh!

761
00:54:04,044 --> 00:54:05,841
Hmm.

762
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:07,278
<i>Ohh</i>.

763
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:10,177
Celebi.

764
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:11,878
Celebi!

765
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:08,001
Good work, Onix. Return!

766
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:11,344
Heh heh heh heh.

767
00:55:11,378 --> 00:55:13,346
Playtime is over, children.

768
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,870
Get them, Celebi.

769
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:18,774
Be careful. This thing could
destroy the whole forest!

770
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:20,184
And the Pokémon!

771
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,415
Suicune!

772
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:42,264
Good job!
Now teach 'em a lesson!

773
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:52,774
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
That's what'll happen

774
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:54,810
to anybody
who tries to stop me!

775
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:02,820
Huh?

776
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,490
You have to be careful.

777
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,396
Celebi's just above us.

778
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:07,525
Thanks a lot.

779
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:08,864
Let's go, Sam.

780
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:10,097
Right.

781
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:14,900
Uhh! Where are you going?

782
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:16,806
Get me out of here! Hey!

783
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,448
Celebi, you have to stop!

784
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:24,711
You're supposed
to protect the forest...

785
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:25,718
not destroy it!

786
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:26,878
Celebi!

787
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,598
What are you
waiting for, Celebi?

788
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:48,903
They're your enemies!

789
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:55,876
-Uhh!

790
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:00,944
Celebi, we're not your enemies!

791
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:02,716
We're trying to save you!

792
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,495
Try to remember!

793
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,691
Celebi...

794
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:15,030
you brought me with you
here to the future!

795
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,434
Celebi, destroy them!

796
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,305
Huh?

797
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:30,907
Uh, where's it going?

798
00:58:00,513 --> 00:58:02,208
Celebi, it's me.

799
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:03,716
Don't you remember?

800
00:58:24,604 --> 00:58:26,128
Look at me!

801
00:58:31,878 --> 00:58:33,175
Remember?

802
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:36,478
Celebi, don't help that hunter.

803
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:37,608
Fight him.

804
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:37,879
Aah!

805
00:58:40,954 --> 00:58:42,819
I won't give up!

806
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:06,371
Hmm?

807
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:08,946
Huh?

808
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:11,816
What in the--

809
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:13,341
What's going on?

810
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:14,353
Aah!

811
00:59:17,257 --> 00:59:18,224
Huh?

812
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:20,724
Celebi!

813
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:23,192
We did it!

814
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:26,027
Oh, no! Aah!

815
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:31,537
Aah! Aah!

816
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,801
Aah! Aah!

817
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:37,366
Meowth, look!

818
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,105
There goes Jessie!

819
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:03,895
Oh, no!

820
01:00:24,357 --> 01:00:25,847
Oh, Ash is all right!

821
01:00:25,892 --> 01:00:27,723
Yeah, and so is Sam.

822
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,490
They've got Celebi, too.

823
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:30,518
Huh?

824
01:00:35,168 --> 01:00:37,329
What's wrong?

825
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,998
I don't know.
Something bad.

826
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,269
The water.

827
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:49,645
Get it into the water!

828
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:57,221
It's not working.

829
01:00:57,257 --> 01:00:58,724
But why not?

830
01:00:58,758 --> 01:01:00,589
The forest is hurt.

831
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:02,322
The water's tainted.

832
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:04,455
The lake is dying.

833
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,488
But then--wait a second.

834
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:11,129
Suicune has the power to make
the water clean again.

835
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,435
Suicune,
if you clean the water...

836
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:14,701
we can save Celebi.

837
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:52,139
The legend's true.

838
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:54,840
The north wind
saved the lake.

839
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:03,280
Celebi, the water's clean again.

840
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:11,191
It isn't working.

841
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:16,532
All right, then.
We'll keep trying.

842
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:26,439
See? These are those berries
we found in the forest.

843
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:28,413
Here you go.

844
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:31,205
Uhh.

845
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,780
Uh...

846
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:38,315
Heh. That's OK.

847
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:39,985
Uhh.

848
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:45,094
Uh, Celebi?

849
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,767
Celebi, you can't die!

850
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:11,518
Celebi didn't do
anything wrong.

851
01:03:11,558 --> 01:03:13,890
It was a human being
who forced Celebi

852
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:15,656
to destroy the forest.

853
01:03:15,695 --> 01:03:18,858
Celebi never even had a choice.

854
01:03:18,898 --> 01:03:20,832
Uhh! And now--uhh--

855
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:23,495
it can't have a choice.

856
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:26,630
Now it's too late to choose
'cause Celebi is gonna die!

857
01:04:17,957 --> 01:04:18,924
Huh?

858
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,585
Huh?

859
01:04:35,008 --> 01:04:36,475
I know that sound.

860
01:04:36,509 --> 01:04:38,443
The Voice of the Forest.

861
01:04:48,454 --> 01:04:50,046
Ahh.

862
01:06:05,498 --> 01:06:06,556
Ohh.

863
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,306
Ha ha.

864
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,703
The spirits of
the future and the past

865
01:06:18,745 --> 01:06:20,838
can travel through time
as well...

866
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,848
and so they've all come.

867
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:24,179
They've must've sensed

868
01:06:24,217 --> 01:06:25,946
that their friend
was in trouble.

869
01:06:27,053 --> 01:06:29,988
And now they're here to help.

870
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:31,512
Ha.

871
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:26,335
-Ha ha!
-Hey!

872
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,050
It's the hunter!

873
01:07:39,091 --> 01:07:43,687
And now I have everything I need
to rule the world!

874
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:45,924
Give Celebi back!

875
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,972
Celebi!

876
01:07:58,945 --> 01:08:01,539
Get off me, kid!

877
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:03,640
Give it back!

878
01:08:03,683 --> 01:08:05,844
Pikachu, use your Thunder Bolt!

879
01:08:06,953 --> 01:08:08,887
Uhh! No! Wait! Pikachu!

880
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:11,151
Aaaaah!

881
01:08:22,602 --> 01:08:25,070
Aaaaah!

882
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:28,940
Uhh! Uhh!

883
01:08:28,975 --> 01:08:30,499
Huh?

884
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:32,342
Oh. Ha ha.

885
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:34,910
Celebi.

886
01:08:34,947 --> 01:08:39,111
<i>Aaaaaah!</i>

887
01:08:41,687 --> 01:08:43,416
Ash!

888
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:43,989
Hey!

889
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:03,835
Huh? Huh!

890
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:06,140
You tried to destroy
our forest, mister...

891
01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:08,942
and we don't take kindly
to that kind of behavior.

892
01:09:14,854 --> 01:09:16,151
Uhh!

893
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:21,287
This is all a mistake--

894
01:09:21,327 --> 01:09:23,488
a big misunderstanding.

895
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:25,121
Ohh!

896
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:32,599
I think the Pokémon
understand perfectly.

897
01:09:32,638 --> 01:09:34,765
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

898
01:09:38,177 --> 01:09:39,439
Suicune!

899
01:09:39,478 --> 01:09:40,740
Thank you!

900
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,214
Maybe we'll see you
again someday.

901
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,455
Good-bye, Suicune!

902
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:01,892
Huh?

903
01:10:01,934 --> 01:10:03,162
Uh...

904
01:10:09,976 --> 01:10:11,603
It looks like Celebi's
getting ready

905
01:10:11,644 --> 01:10:13,236
to travel back in time...

906
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,612
and I think it wants
to take you along, Sam.

907
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:19,641
Can you really
bring me back, Celebi?

908
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:25,717
Looks like
you're goin' home, Sam.

909
01:10:25,758 --> 01:10:28,124
Yeah, I guess so.

910
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,594
Don't worry.
It won't matter...

911
01:10:30,629 --> 01:10:34,463
'cause wherever you are,
or whenever you are--heh--

912
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,024
we'll always be friends.

913
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:49,111
Thank you, Ash.
You're a great friend.

914
01:10:49,148 --> 01:10:51,412
Thank you all
for everything.

915
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:54,817
Maybe I'll see you
again...someday!

916
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:56,879
I know we will!

917
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:06,388
I'll see you!

918
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,692
Good-bye!

919
01:11:47,706 --> 01:11:49,264
You were right,
Professor.

920
01:11:49,308 --> 01:11:51,708
That Pokémon we saw
was a Suicune.

921
01:11:51,744 --> 01:11:54,042
Yeah, and we met
a Celebi, too.

922
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,638
It even traveled through time.

923
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:57,444
Well, well. It sounds like you saw

924
01:11:57,483 --> 01:12:00,816
some very rare and highly
unusual Pokémon out there.

925
01:12:00,853 --> 01:12:02,821
Huh? What's the matter, Ash?

926
01:12:02,855 --> 01:12:03,981
Uh...

927
01:12:04,023 --> 01:12:05,718
You haven't said
a single word yet.

928
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:08,784
Didn't you enjoy your little
adventure in the forest, too?

929
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:10,728
Oh, sure, Professor.

930
01:12:10,763 --> 01:12:11,991
But, you see...

931
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,828
I met this Pokémon trainer...

932
01:12:13,866 --> 01:12:15,265
and we got to be friends.

933
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:17,326
But l--
I just don't think

934
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:19,234
I'm ever gonna
see him again.

935
01:12:19,271 --> 01:12:20,636
He decided to go back

936
01:12:20,673 --> 01:12:22,538
to where he came from,
Professor--

937
01:12:22,575 --> 01:12:23,872
to another time.

938
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:26,703
I wouldn't worry, Ash.

939
01:12:26,745 --> 01:12:27,837
Oh?

940
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,440
True friendships can withstand
the test of time...

941
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:32,474
and I have a feeling
this one will.

942
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:36,010
I'm sure you and Sammy
will be friends forever.

943
01:12:36,055 --> 01:12:37,852
Mm. Heh heh.

944
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:40,222
Thanks, Professor.
I think so, too.

945
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:45,424
I think we'd better
get going.

946
01:12:45,464 --> 01:12:47,432
Yeah, I don't want
to miss the boat again.

947
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:48,558
We'll tell you everything...

948
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:50,330
when we get
to Pallet Town, OK?

949
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:52,735
Fine. I'm looking forward to it.

950
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,064
Hey.

951
01:12:56,108 --> 01:12:58,235
What's the matter, Misty?

952
01:12:58,277 --> 01:13:00,677
How'd Professor Oak
know Sammy's name?

953
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:02,044
We never mentioned
it to him.

954
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:03,173
Yeah, that's right.

955
01:13:05,951 --> 01:13:10,479
Professor Oak's amazing!
He knows everything!

956
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:26,728
Hmm. It seems like
it happened only yesterday.

957
01:13:36,614 --> 01:13:38,713
This is <i>amazing</i>.

958
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:40,719
This wonderful water's
washed away

959
01:13:40,753 --> 01:13:42,812
all my annoying aches
and pains.

960
01:13:42,855 --> 01:13:45,619
I could just float along
like this forever.

961
01:13:45,658 --> 01:13:47,558
-Ahoy!
-Huh?

962
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:50,084
Jessie, thank goodness
you're safe.

963
01:13:50,129 --> 01:13:51,960
Hurry up. Climb aboard.

964
01:13:51,997 --> 01:13:53,089
What took you so long?

965
01:13:53,132 --> 01:13:54,258
What have you been doing?

966
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,131
We had to wait
till it was safe.

967
01:13:56,168 --> 01:13:57,635
But now the coast is clear.

968
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:58,864
