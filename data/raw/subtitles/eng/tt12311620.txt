He says he has a bomb.

106

basically, I'm going to kill
myself and everybody in here

118
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,293

123
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,175
Fraud was committed.

135
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:28,409
I... I can't do that. I can't
do that. I can't do that.

136
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:31,610
As long as everybody stays
calm, nobody gets hurt, okay?

137
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,889
I promise I-I won't hurt nobody,
but I can't let them go. Sorry.

138
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:38,155
I'm... I'm gonna let y'all out

- if I detonate the bomb, okay? Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

140
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,996
Ma'am, I need to speak to
somebody, a negotiator or someone.

141
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,998
I'm running out of time.
I just...

142
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,538
<i>I do have someone on the
way out there to meet with you.</i>

143
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,364
Okay. <i>What number
does he have to call?</i>

144
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,970
Uh, the bank.

145
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,939

can you ask them?</i>

146
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,677
<i>Confirm I have the right one.</i>
She doesn't have the bank number.

147
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,536
She asking for the bank number.

148
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:59,374
- She could call the land line. One, eight...
<i>- I could find it.</i>

149
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:03,081
<i>Brown, what kind of clothing
are you w... wearing?</i>

150
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,095
Why are you asking me that?

151
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:23,299
What kind of clothes... Why?

152
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,400
But why are you asking me that?

153
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,439
Why did you
just ask me that question?

154
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:33,672
You got the sniper on me?

155
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:43,022
You got the sniper on me?

156
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:45,101
<i>I'm not sure if there are any officers
on scene yet, but they're requesting</i>

157
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,433
<i>to know what clothing you are
wearing.</i> You got the sniper on me.

158
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:50,205
That's why you asking that question,
'cause you got a sniper on me right now.

159
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,492
You want to kill me.

They're going to attack me.

They're gonna attack me
from right there.

166

175
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:39,501
I ain't playing! I'm not!
I'm not playing!

176
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:42,735
Everybody thinks I'm playing,
but I'm not. I'm not!

177
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:45,705
I just...

178
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:51,414
I don't want them to snipe me. I don't want
them to snipe me before I tell my side.

179
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,724
I haven't even told my side of
the story. They're gonna snipe me.

180
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,165
They're gonna shoot me.
They're gon...

181
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:56,617
[exhales] Fuck.

182
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,785
[breathing heavily]

183
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,754
All right.

184
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:07,760
You know what? Just contact
the news networks, okay.

185
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:10,664
Just contact the news networks
and tell 'em what's going on

186
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,864
and have 'em all come down here.

187
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,603
I wanna see CNN, NBC,

188
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:18,639
I wanna see Don Lemon,
I wanna see daytime!

189
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,147
Everything! Tell them
about what's happening.

190
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,478
Just tell 'em!

191
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,646
Just tell 'em.

192
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:35,128
See? See!

193
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:38,857
See, there's an officer right
there, trying to take a pop at me.

194
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,476
He's trying to take a pop at me. There's an
officer... officer right there, across the street.

195
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,830
I can see him.
He's trying to take a pop at me.

196
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,865
He trying to take a pop.
Get the switches!

197
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,241
Get the lights!
All right. Okay.

198
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,378
Do I have my negotiator?

199
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:56,743
He says he wants a negotiator.

200
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,877
[operator] <i>Well, I do have
the call already entered.</i>

201
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,880
<i>And they will either come out
there or call you as soon as possible.</i>

202
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,850
She says they're on their way.

203
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,225
Okay.

204
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,231
Get the blinds.
Get the blinds behind you!

205
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,866
- Can you hold, please?
- Get the blinds.

206
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,630
I have to get the blinds.

207
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,205
Get the blinds!
Get the blinds!

208
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,771
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

209
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,814
Okay. Thank you.

210
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:38,620
It's okay.

211
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,359
Okay.

212
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,261
How do I... How do I use
this? The flashing one.

213
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:16,427
The flashing one, okay.

214
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,727
Yeah, hello?
<i>Yeah, I'm online here.</i>

215
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:21,465
Do you have someone
out here for me?

216
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,336
<i>If you want to speak with him,
you will need to tell me.</i>

217
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,833
Ma'am, I do not have as
much time as you think I do.

218
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:30,375
<i>Hello, they're going to call. And once
they do that, you can talk with them,</i>

219
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,971
<i>but I need to keep you
on the line until they do.</i>

220
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,446
Come over here.

221
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:37,481
Come on down here.
Come on.

222
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,417
It's okay.
Just come on over here.

223
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:40,979
All right, stay right there.

224
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,387
There you go.

225
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:44,851
Just stay right there.

226
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,395
You okay? No, no, no. No,
no, no. No need to go down.

227
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,430
They ain't gonna shoot you.

228
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:55,532
They're going to have my body
on the tarmac before you, trust me.

229
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,931
Okay. All right, you good?

230
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,703
I'm not going to hurt you. You
know that, right? [muffled cry]

231
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,849
I ain't going to hurt you. I ain't gonna
lay one finger on you, I promise you that.

232
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:05,873
Okay?

233
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Why don't you
tell me something positive?

234
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,780
Uh, what do you like?

235
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,650
Go to the club?

236
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:17,785
I like Jean Grey.

237
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,020
[crying]
That's random.

238
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:24,561
That's really random.

239
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,635
You ever been robbed before?

240
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,869
Yes. Once.

241
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,641
How'd it end?
What's your name again?

242
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:41,578
- Estel.
- Estel, okay. Estel, how'd it end?

243
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,316
And don't lie to me.
I don't...

244
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:45,010
I don't like people lying to me.

245
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,980
Mm-mmm. No, uh,
he... he was arrested.

246
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,917
- They didn't kill him?
- Mm-mmm. No, sir.

247
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,492
He got to be white.
[scoffs]

248
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:00,333
Estel, can you get on the phone
with the network?

249
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,732
But call 911 first. This woman
on the phone, she is no help.

250
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,602
- I gotta go to my desk for that.
- Okay.

251
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,769
That's fine, and shut
those doors again, okay.

252
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,650
They come in here,
they gonna shoot everybody up.

253
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,608
- Spray and pray. That's how they do.
- Okay.

254
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:14,644
- I... I did... I-I locked it when you first asked me to.
- When? When?

255
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,811
When you first asked me to.

256
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:21,981
Okay. Okay. It's all right.
Forgive me.

257
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:24,456
Okay.

258
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,021
Is there another dial-out number
I could use here?

259
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:31,936
I need to contact my people, make sure
they know what's happening, you know?

260
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,565
Don't want to have
everybody worried.

261
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,567
- You could use that one over there.
- Yeah?

262
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:38,943
Yeah. I'm going to leave here.
Don't want you to do anything.

263
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,473
I'm just going to move
over there, take a call, okay?

264
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:45,136
[Estel] I'm here
at the Windy Hills Wells Fargo,

265
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:47,446
and there's a man
holding up the bank.

266
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:51,351
[Rosa] The code is nine.

267
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,947
[Estel]
There is a man holding us up.

268
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:59,425

269
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,153

Come on, baby.

271
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,695
[Estel]
We could use some help.

272
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:11,635
Ma'am, are you there?

273
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,572

276
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,046
Hello?
<i>Hey there.</i>

277
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:29,587
<i>Is this the Windy Hills

278
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:35,021
Uh, yes, ma'am.
This is the Wells Fargo.

279
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:37,958
<i>Uh, yeah, I need to talk
to Bridget about my 401(k).</i>

280
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:40,532
<i>I think she made
a $9,000 mistake.</i>

281
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,832
Unfortunately, uh, Bridget is
not here to discuss your 401(k),

282
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:45,900
but can I take a
message for you? <i>Yeah.</i>

283
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:48,441
You been having a good day?

284

<i>Uh, could be better.</i>

285
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,939
Sorry to hear that, ma'am.

286
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,414
Okay, shoot.

289
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:09,154
That's for Bridget.
She gonna need that.

290

[operator]
<i>Where are you located at?</i>

291
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,997
I am near the front door.

<i>Okay, just stay on the line
with me.</i>

293
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,605
They got fire?
[Estel] I don't know.

294
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,003
- He wants fire trucks.
- What do you mean you don't know?

295
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:30,549
[scoffs] <i>Our fire trucks will not
pull up on scene if there is a bomb.</i>

296
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,652
I'm sorry.

297
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:38,590
How much money do you need, sir?

298
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:44,222
I can get it for you.
[line ringing]

299
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,664
It's sitting right up there.

[automated voice]<i> You have reached
the voice mailbox of...</i> [Kiah]<i> Kiah.</i>

00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:58,775
I don't want the bank's money.

302
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:04,110
I just want the cash...

303
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,883
that those people took from me.

304
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:09,687
That's all I want.

[banging]

306
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,826
Okay. Okay, it's okay! It's
okay. I got it, I got it, I got it!

307
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:18,993
Go! Go! Go!

308
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:22,293
[panting]
What happening? Who's shooting?

309
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,031
[Estel] It is an employee!

310
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,000
It's all clear.
[operator]<i> Hello?</i>

311
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:27,870
He's gone.
<i>Estel, do you need me?</i>

00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,543

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

316
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:39,651
It's just a reflex. I'm sorry.
<i>You still have a visual on him?</i>

317
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,082
No. No. I'm sorry,
okay. I apologize.

318
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:46,691
Ma'am, I apologize, okay?
I did not mean to do that.

319
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,770
How come y'all letting people
walk up to the entrance?

320
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:50,794
It seems like y'all
could do better than that.

321
00:24:52,864 --> 00:24:54,765
[whispers]
You gotta get us out of here.

322
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:09,241
[gasping]

323
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,850
Hello?
<i>Yes, I'm here.</i>

324
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:17,051
I still don't have a damn
negotiator, and I'm wondering why.

325
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:18,151
Where's my negotiator?

326
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,791
Hello?

327
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:22,221
<i>All right,
hang on just a second.</i>

328
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,762
[Brian] Hello?

329
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,234
Sir, we can really help you.
Please, um... Please don't!

330
00:25:36,204 --> 00:25:37,907

[Brian]
I had a button made, okay.

332
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,747
You see this?

333
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:47,015
We got kids.
Please don't, sir.

334
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,623
I need my negotiator. Somebody...
Somebody to come down and talk!

335
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:52,383
To talk! That's all!

336
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:55,320
Where's my negotiator?
Please, ma'am, just...

337
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:58,862
<i>Sir. Just hold onto the phone
right here...</i>

338
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:00,809
I've been holding on.
I've been holding on though.

339
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:03,130
I've been holding on though.
I held on.

340
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:09,972
<i>If we get disconnected,
I'll call you right back, okay?</i>

341
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,042
<i>Okay?</i>

342
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:16,308
You gonna have
my negotiator ready for me?

343
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,080
Ma'am?

344
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:21,115
<i>Yes, sir, you just hold
onto the line.</i> Okay.

345
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,150
<i>I'll get him on.</i>
Okay.

348
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:39,298
I'm sorry, y'all,
I had to do that.

349
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:50,881
Any of y'all ladies
need the restroom?

350
00:26:57,725 --> 00:27:00,660
- I could do to use the restroom.
- All right, go on then.

360
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:56,276
Make sure she good, aight?

<i>You there, sir?</i>
Uh, yes, I am.

362
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:08,255
<i>Hello, Mr. Easley.
My name is Major Riddick.</i>

363
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,191
<i>Now you tell us
what's going on in there, okay?</i>

364
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:12,106
- The Department of Veterans Affairs...
- Estel?

365
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:13,931
Estel.

366
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:19,035
They left me destitute
and homeless and, uh...

367
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,269
I'm... I'm going to be on the streets.
So I need your assistance, sir.

368
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:25,041
<i>All right.
What can we do to help you out?</i>

369
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:27,241
Well, pay me my money.

370
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:30,211
That's the whole reason why we
having this conversation, sir.

371
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:32,785
<i>All right, how much...
How much is that exactly?</i>

372
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:39,220
Estel, I think we're gonna be
on the TV. Turn it on.

373
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:41,893
We're gonna be on one of
the channels. Sorry about that.

374
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:45,457
<i>Well, would you be willing to come
outside and talk... talk to us about that?</i>

375
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,427
Sir, I'm not coming outside.

376
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:50,803
<i>All right, what are your
intentions right now?</i>

377
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:54,037
Well, uh,

378
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:58,272
my intentions are to blow up this
place if my demands aren't met.

379
00:28:58,307 --> 00:29:02,078
I told y'all before. I don't know why
I have to repeat myself, but okay.

380
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:05,147
Uh, you know, I'm serious, sir.
I will blow this place up, sir.

381
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:07,347
<i>- Okay. Okay.</i>
- Oh, sir, most importantly,

382
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,920
I want to talk to my daughter.

383
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,087
I can't seem to get through.
<i>All right.</i>

384
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:15,058
<i>Call you back in a little bit, Mr. Weasley,
okay?</i> Yeah, that is absolutely fine.

385
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,193
[busy signal beeps]

386
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,130

What you think? Think
the conversation was good?

389
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,147
Yes. I think it was a
good conversation. You?

390
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:39,412
Yes.
Yeah.

391
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:41,315
Yeah.

395
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:00,268
Mom?
Mmm.

396
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,501
Mama?
Mm-hmm.

Mama.
Mm-hmm.

Mom.
Mm-hmm.

400
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:21,223
Someone must really
wanna talk to you.

401
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:23,929
Okay, baby. My phone...

402
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:26,195
Okay.

403
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,901
Okay.

404
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:30,463
Let me see.

405
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:34,005
Okay, baby.

406
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,074
Hello.
[Brian]<i> Hello, Cass?</i>

407
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,307
[sighing] Yes. <i>I've been
calling you all morning.</i>

408
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,078
<i>Why you ain't
pick up your phone?</i>

409
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:43,410
All right, all right, all right.
I'm up now, all right?

410
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:46,512
I just... Why you call me so many
times? It's not even your number.

411
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:49,427
That's why you should have picked up your
damn phone. I've been callin' and callin'...

412
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,463
I had a patient die at four o'clock this
morning. I'm gonna go back to sleep.

413
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:55,422
Oh, no. Don't do that, okay?
Hey, look, uh...

414
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:00,427
I'm in the middle
of something and, um,

415
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,400
depending on how everything works out,
I... I might go to jail for a long time.

416
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:09,337
[scoffs]
Okay. Listen, Brian, I...

417
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,570
Are you off your medication?

418
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:15,079
Don't do that, Cass.

419
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:17,983
<i>I was just calling
to tell you that</i>

420
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:19,677
<i>if something
were to happen to me...</i>

421
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,318
<i>I'm trying to do right, okay?</i>

422
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:27,223
<i>I'm trying to right something
here, and I'm in a little situation.</i>

423
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:30,193
<i>And I just wanted you to know
I'm just trying to do the right thing.</i>

424
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:32,723
<i>I'm trying to make the
right decisions.</i> Yeah...

425
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,660
And I'm just trying to tell you
that everything I do...

426
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:39,004
Everything I do
is for you and Kiah.

427
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,335
Mm-hmm.
<i>Everything.</i>

428
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,634
Yeah, well, uh, Brian, I don't...

429
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:46,737
I don't really know where
you're going with this, so...

430
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,048
I don't know what...
Okay, thank you. [chuckles]

431
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:57,616
You know what, you right.
Put my daughter on the phone.

432
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,520
<i>All right. But don't you be
spooking her like you did.</i>

433
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,522
I never spook our baby.

434
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:05,360
<i>Yesterday you told her how you
got thrown on the street in handcuffs.</i>

435
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:07,659
She needs to know how this
world treats people like us.

436
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:10,761
<i>I'm just letting her know. She's
about to be in the world herself.</i>

437
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,302
Yeah, all right, Brian.

438
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:15,700
I'm not going through this
with you again, all right?

439
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:18,274
[sighs]<i> Yes, ma'am.</i>

440
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,112
Kiah!

441
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,180
<i>Your father's on the phone,
Kiah.</i>

442
00:32:23,215 --> 00:32:24,984
[Brian] Hey, she mad?

443
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,515
[Cassandra]
<i>She got reason to be.</i>

444
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,128
Cassandra...

445
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:42,793
I'm holding up the bank, and now's not the
right time to be ignoring my calls, okay?

446
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,038
<i>I've got hostages. I'm holding
up the bank.</i> You're not... [laughs]

447
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:50,240
<i>So, could you put my daughter
on the phone, please?</i>

448
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,340
Thank you.

449
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
[Kiah]<i> Daddy?</i>

450
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,300
Hey, hey, hey, baby girl.

451
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:19,566
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

452
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:20,633
Hey.

453
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:26,474
I just wanted to let you know
that I love you, okay.

454
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:29,378
Are you apologizing
and picking me up?

455
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:33,217
<i>You gonna be mean to Daddy?
You ain't gonna give Daddy a break?</i>

456
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:35,417
<i>Baby, you know
I'll always tell you the truth.</i>

457
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:38,123
And, uh, I hurt you.
I did.

458
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:40,125
<i>Well, you shouldn't have
given me your word.</i>

459
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,688
I apologize, baby.
<i>That's not telling the truth.</i>

460
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:46,263
You hate when people don't
tell you the truth. <i>I know. I know.</i>

461
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:51,235
Baby, you know, sometimes when people
steal from you, you've got no choice.

462
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,731
You gotta get it back.

463
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:56,669
And when I do,
I'm gonna get you a puppy.

464
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,673
Are you for real?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

465
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,742
<i>Yes. That's the first thing
on my list.</i>

466
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:07,482
Okay, call me when you're ready.
Love you. Bye.

467
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:09,649
- Don't hang up. Hey.
- [busy signal beeps]

468
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,520
What did your father say?

469
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:15,721
He got money, so he's
gonna get me my puppy.

470
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,303
Just like your damn mama.

471
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:43,815
You look scared.

472
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,126
You scared?

473
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:49,425
I am.

474
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,563
I told you...

475
00:34:58,403 --> 00:34:59,897
if I die today...

476
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:03,571
I die alone.

<i>Hi, is Bridget back yet?</i>

484
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:52,620
Ma'am, the bank is being robbed.
I'm the one robbing it. Do not call again!

[Brian sighs]

486
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,592
Come on, man.

487
00:35:58,529 --> 00:35:59,594
Come on.

491
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:23,684
Kiah. Baby,
go back to your room.

492
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,324
Why I gotta be in my
room, Mama? Listen.

493
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,426
When I know what I need to
know, I'll let you know, okay?

494
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:31,593
Please, baby. Just
go back to your room.

495
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:35,531
Thank you.

496
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:45,541
[Estel] Brian? Brian?

497
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:55,617
My ex-husband... same thing
happened to him almost.

498
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:57,817
[Estel sighs]

499
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:59,016
I, um...

500
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,557
I'm scared.

501
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,957
But I feel compassion for you.

502
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,402
You know, my son
and, uh, I... [chuckles]

503
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:15,538
...we go to downtown Atlanta
on the weekends,

504
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:17,408
pass out to the homeless.

505
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,677
And they have stories.

506
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:31,356
People judge. They underestimate
how folks get in their position.

507
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:33,820
I know stories like yours.

508
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:35,888
They fought for the country,

509
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:38,561
and they come here and they
don't get approved, and I'm like...

510
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:41,894
[scoffs] "I'm sorry."

511
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,368
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,700
[cell phone buzzes]

513
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:47,669
Who's that?

514
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,342
[sighs]

515
00:37:50,377 --> 00:37:51,640
An old friend.

516
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,007
[Brian]
It's your ex-husband.

517
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,811
[scoffs]

518
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:03,388
I mean, if... if it is, you
probably should hit him back.

519
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:06,721
Ain't nothing harder on the
heart than reaching out to an ex

520
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,921
and not hearing from them.

521
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:11,726
I see you love your family.

522
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:14,498
[scoffs]
My close family.

523
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,829
My daughter,

524
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,469
Kiah.

525
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,969
Maybe if you let us out,

526
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:26,804
- we'll tell them how good you been to us.
- They're not gonna kill me?

527
00:38:31,616 --> 00:38:33,044
They're not gonna kill me?

528
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:46,090
Did you tell me about your
family and your husband

529
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,696
and your good times

530
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:49,126
'cause you think I'm a fool?

531
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,536
- No.
- Try to soften me up? Is that what it is?

532
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:56,507
You think I'm dumb or slow?
Is that what it is? No. Not at all.

533
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,170
'Cause people be doing that a lot.
Thinking I'm a fool, thinking I'm slow.

534
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,579
I... I don't know if that's
what you was doing, ma'am.

535
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:03,943
Brother, you're not a fool.

536
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:07,914
I'm not a fool?
Okay. I'm not a fool.

537
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:12,424
I'm just scared. [chuckles]

538
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,690
That's all. Scared.

539
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:15,889
Okay.

540
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:19,926
I understand.

541
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:26,471
You gonna turn the TV off.
This is not working.

542
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:34,908
[sighs]

543
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:43,048
Did y'all just turn off the TV
in the bus... in the business?

544
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,985
You've got to let me know
what he's doing inside the bank.

545
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,990
Excuse me if I'm not doing
exactly what you need of me.

546
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:55,599
I don't know what y'all are doing. We
need someone to negotiate with him now.

547
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:07,941
[police chattering]

548
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:11,241
[officer] Bernard!
Hey, how you doing?

549
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,144
Riddick
is setting the perimeter.

550
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,850
Wants the area clear of any
potential bombs or co-conspirators.

551
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:18,050
Okay. We got four
SWAT units here.

552
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:21,856
Cobb County PD, plus Marietta.

553
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:23,957
Cobb sheriff's team is out.

554
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:25,057
Got the dogs.

555
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,224
[dog barks]
Smyrna PD.

556
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,501
We got the FBI, the GBI.

557
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,635
Everybody here.
Got yourself a party.

558
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,266
So how many snipers we got?

559
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:40,039
Uh, three units,
as I understand.

560
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:42,943
But like I said,
there's a lot going on.

561
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:48,916
- That's the new chief?
- Yeah. That's him.

562
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,994
[line rings]

563
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:04,800
[phone rings]

564
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,674
WSB-TV tip-line. This is
Lisa Larson. What's your tip?

565
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,643
<i>Hello, this is, uh,
Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

566
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,877
<i>I'm heisting a Wells Fargo
on Windy Hills Road,</i>

567
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:18,946
<i>and I have a bomb and hostages.</i>

568
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:20,783
You're what?

569
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:22,884
<i>Just calling to let
y'all know.</i> Uh...

570
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,052
You're at the Wells Fargo...

571
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:27,757
You're at the Wells Fargo now,

572
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:30,320
at the bank...
Holding up the bank

573
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,729
and you're calling us at WSB?

574
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:35,996
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

575
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:38,295
Uh, what was your name again,
sir, please?

576
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,967
<i>My name is Brian Brown-Easley.</i>

577
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,707
Brian Brown-Easley.

578
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:48,074
Okay, you hold one sec.
<i>Okay.</i>

579
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:52,210
I want you to sit here,
close to the camera.

580
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:57,655
Lisa's got the Windy
Hill robber on the line.

581
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,118
[cameraman]
All right, I'm hot.

582
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:02,088
You got sound?

583
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:04,794
[crew] Yeah, we're good.

584
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,093
[cameraman]
We're recording.

585
00:42:07,128 --> 00:42:09,865
Okay, thank you. Um...

586
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,967
And how would you like to
be addressed? Is it Brian?

587
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:14,903
<i>Or... Or Mr. Easley?</i>

588
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:16,707
Brian's good.
<i>Okay, Brian.</i>

589
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,303
Why are you holding up
a bank today, sir?

590
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:22,779
<i>Because I'm a nobody to the VA.</i>

591
00:42:22,814 --> 00:42:25,012
You know, just so we
can verify who you are,

592
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:27,080
do you have a social
security number or something?

593
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:29,918
You trying to steal my
money too, like the VA?

594
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:32,217
<i>No, no, no.</i> [chuckles]
Trying to take my cash?

595
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:35,055
No, I'm good. I'm not
trying to steal your money.

596
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,958
This is...
This is just so we can help.

597
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:40,027
<i>Ma'am, just so you know,
I don't have a criminal record.</i>

598
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,996
<i>I mean this is not
my day-to-day.</i>

599
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:46,737
Well, but you say you have
bombs, right? Where'd you get that?

600
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,839
Oh, I can't give you
that information, ma'am.

601
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:53,942
<i>Well, is it something that
could, you know, level the bank?</i>

602
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:59,211
Probably gonna
take out the whole room.

603
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:00,751
<i>What kind of bomb?</i>

604
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,347
Semtex.
<i>Semtex?</i>

605
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:05,724
Take care now.

606
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,989
You too.

607
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:10,926
[siren blares]
[police radio chatter]

608
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:16,932
[helicopter flies over]

609
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,033
[officer] <i>Can we contact
Wells Fargo security</i>

610
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:23,004
<i>and see if they have the cameras
inside that we might be able to access?</i>

611
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,237
[indistinct radio chatter]

612
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,341
Major Riddick.

613
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:33,982
Sergeant, you up
to speed? Indeed.

614
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,413
Okay, we're ready
to conference in.

615
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,383
We're conferencing in.
[phone beeps]

616
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,155
Ma'am, I'm... I'm not a thief.

617
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,355
<i>Okay, I haven't taken anything
from the bank.</i>

618
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,258
<i>I'm a decorated marine.
I'm a lance corporal.</i>

619
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:48,161
Who's this on the phone?

620
00:43:48,196 --> 00:43:49,426
[Riddick] WSB-TV.

621
00:43:52,134 --> 00:43:54,805
So why is the suspect talking
to a reporter and not us?

622
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,434
We were just buying time
until you decided to show up.

623
00:43:58,272 --> 00:43:59,711
[Brian]
<i>Two tours Iraq.</i>

624
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:01,372
Camp Fox and Taqaddum.

625
00:44:02,947 --> 00:44:04,111
Honorable discharge.

626
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:06,718
[Lisa]<i> Good for you, sir.</i>

627
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:10,084
<i>And did you make friends? You know,
along the way that you've kept up with?</i>

628
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,723
[Brian]<i> Yeah, I did,</i>

629
00:44:11,758 --> 00:44:14,286
but we lost contact, you know.

630
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,728
I don't really check in with
nobody or everybody these days.

631
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:18,125
I kinda stay to myself.

632
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,864
<i>So the VA...
What's going on there?</i>

633
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:35,945
[typing on keyboard]

634
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:40,213
Okay. Okay. Thanks.

635
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:42,853
So it looks like this payment
was redirected

636
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,318
to a college you're using
your GI Bill at, to cure a deficit.

637
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,518
Good news is, you're all
caught up on payments.

638
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:51,829
I was not behind on anything. Damn, I
overpaid on that Windows '08 bullshit.

639
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:54,997
Disability checks never are
confiscated unless there's an unpaid bill.

640
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:56,526
Does an unpaid bill
sound familiar?

641
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:59,298
I've been over this with
the VA helpline. Twice.

642
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,399
I called the-the VA crisis-line.

643
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,775
I called, uh, Lincoln Tech.

644
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:08,010
I been down to the office, but you...
you know what the problem is, ma'am?

645
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:10,342
- You don't write nothing down.
- [sighs]

646
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:13,081
If you put that pen to that paper,
you would have that information.

647
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:15,083
Please, please don't raise
your voice, Mr. Easley.

648
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:17,052
It's just a suggestion.

649
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,368
- I ain't raising my voice.
- That's who's got your money.

650
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:22,222
I have two jobs.

651
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:24,895
Two.

652
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,864
I've been ill.

653
00:45:26,899 --> 00:45:29,933
I had to take leave, so I'm
reliant on this disability check.

654
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:35,004
Ma'am, don't dip into my money
and call it a day.

655
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:41,076
You gonna have me on...
On the streets.

656
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,112
I'm a grown man.

657
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:47,016
I won't be able to feed myself.

658
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:00,227
We have programs for those
who are food and housing insecure.

659
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,364
You can call the helpline or you can
take a number and wait in that line.

660
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,471
Okay.

661
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,610
Thank you.

662
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:24,416
[clerk] Next.

663
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,319
[service desk chimes]

664
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:51,080
Yeah, they said I still owe,
which is a damn lie.

665
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,213
It's a lie.

666
00:46:53,282 --> 00:46:57,548
[sighs] That must've been
very frustrating.

667
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:00,353
[Brian]
<i>It was. I'm not a psychopath.</i>

668
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:02,993
I know what I do
and I know what I don't.

669
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,357
I know, I hear you.
<i>Truth.</i>

670
00:47:10,596 --> 00:47:11,661
I hear you, Brian.

671
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:13,102
Do you?

672
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,239
What station is this again?
<i>WSB-TV, why?</i>

673
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:21,275
<i>We're recording right now,
we live, on TV?</i>

674
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:24,047
[Lisa] Um...

675
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:26,181
I'll take that as a no.

676
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:27,512
<i>Well, what it means is that</i>

677
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:30,317
<i>we're not gonna exploit you
for ratings.</i>

678
00:47:30,352 --> 00:47:34,321
<i>So we're gonna wait...</i> I need the
world to see what's happening here.

679
00:47:34,356 --> 00:47:36,422
Can you do that for me, ma'am?

680
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:37,654
Can we do that?

681
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,029
<i>Please.</i>

682
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,362
Major Riddick,
are we allowed to go live?

683
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:45,530
Hey, uh, put the TV on WSB.

684
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:49,138
[operator] <i>We're working
to get you two out.</i>

685
00:47:49,173 --> 00:47:52,372
<i>Don't try nothing. Just
stay put until we get there.</i>

686
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:58,246
<i>Our priority is the protection
of life inside the dwelling.</i>

687
00:47:58,281 --> 00:48:02,283
<i>We're now running a multi-agency
operation to get these hostages out safe.</i>

688
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,484
- [interviewer]<i> At what point do you have to change...</i>
- Ma'am.

689
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:08,223
You have
a police officer on air,

690
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:10,720
but the man who the situation
is about is nowhere to be seen.

691
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:13,426
- Does that make sense to you?
- Have you got kids?

692
00:48:13,461 --> 00:48:15,197
You know I do.

693
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:18,134
<i>Well, then you know why
you called here first.</i>

694
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,434
Why'd I do that?

695
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:26,175
Because we are not
going to let your children...

696
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,078
Yours and mine...

697
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,312
<i>Watch you blow up that bank
on the air.</i>

698
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:35,250
[officer on TV] <i>The suspect,
I should say, is workable...</i>

699
00:48:35,285 --> 00:48:38,000
[reporter] <i>I understand he is a
local. Yes, but I cannot confirm that.</i>

700
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:39,188
<i>And what can you tell us...</i>

701
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:40,992
So what's it look like
out there?

702
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:42,763
[reporter]<i> It may have something</i>
<i>to do with this outcome.</i>

703
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,271
[officer] <i>I do not have information
regarding that at this moment.</i>

704
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:47,163
They got a lot of people
waiting for me?

705
00:48:48,496 --> 00:48:50,694
[helicopter whirring]

706
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,570
[police radio chatter]

707
00:49:06,217 --> 00:49:07,612
[cell phone buzzes]

708
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:10,153
Hello?

709
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:12,221
<i>Cassandra Easley?</i>
Yes.

710
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:15,356
<i>I'm Agent Jackman of the FBI. Can
you confirm your current address?</i>

711
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,558
[police chatter]
[police dog barks]

712
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,301
[Lisa] <i>Do you have any
other family we could contact?</i>

713
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,767
[Brian]
<i>My brother. But we don't talk.</i>

714
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,043
[officer] Nothing.

715
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:35,376
Hey, everybody.

716
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:37,444
Riddick, right? Yes,
sir. Real pleasure.

717
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,578
Fine job out here.
Got everything you need?

718
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:44,088
Yeah, snipers are in place. Area's
clean. Uh, no sign of an accomplice.

719
00:49:44,123 --> 00:49:46,453
Now that Bernard's here,
we're ready to rock and roll.

720
00:49:46,488 --> 00:49:49,291
Good, good. Atlanta's
watching you today, son.

721
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:51,425
- [Brian]<i> Okay, this is good.</i>
- No pressure.

722
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,537
[Lisa] <i>...trying to figure out
what's happening over there...</i>

723
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:56,628
Let's just give him five more
minutes. Let him wind down.

724
00:49:57,796 --> 00:49:59,367
Lisa...

725
00:50:02,768 --> 00:50:04,537
can I ask you a question?

726
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:06,638
<i>Sure.</i>

727
00:50:10,116 --> 00:50:11,442
Is life hard for you?

728
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:17,748
It's hard for everybody I know.
They...

729
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:21,521
Is it really hard, like...

730
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,394
Seems like everywhere I turn,
they...

731
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,567
You know, my own brother
put a hit out on me.

732
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:41,310
How did he, uh...

733
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:43,543
I don't know.
I don't know. They said...

734
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,744
They said he put
20,000 on my head.

735
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,681
Brian, who said that?

736
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,782
The streets is talking.

737
00:50:56,525 --> 00:51:00,560
He a part of some secret
society, some cult like that.

738
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:05,136
I don't really mess with him,
but they real, real sick people.

739
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:08,502
Just four kidnapping attempts
on me last year.

740
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:10,702
You know that? Four.

741
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:14,739
[Lisa]<i> Are you sure?</i>

742
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:17,478
[Brian]<i> Am I sure?</i>

743
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,117
We gotta stop this.

744
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:20,811
[Lisa]<i> All right.</i>

745
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:23,254
<i>Uh...</i>

746
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:25,156
<i>Well...</i>

747
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:26,355
You know what?

748
00:51:28,392 --> 00:51:29,622
I don't need a translator.

749
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,824
I need to be on the camera.
Can you send somebody down here?

750
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:37,894
Oh. Well, we have, um...
We have reporters out there.

751
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:40,765
Mark said that it can work, uh...
You can meet him at a window.

752
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,767
Yeah, we have reporters
out there, uh...

753
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:45,737
<i>But how would we do it?
Is there a window...</i>

754
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:51,644
[Brian]<i> Ma'am, ma'am,</i>
<i>I'm not going near the window.</i>

755
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,547
I do not want to get shot.

756
00:51:53,582 --> 00:51:56,748
- Coming through. Coming through!
- [person] Hey!

757
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,487
[person 2] Sir!
Stay away from that bank.

758
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:02,325
Tell your reporters
to stay the fuck off the phone.

759
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,195
You're jeopardizing
his life and yours.

760
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,264
That reporter...
You have been warned.

761
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:12,500
As you can see, this is
a very volatile situation.

762
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:15,965
Don't you have a... a long lens that
zoom in that you can see me with?

763
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,869
I'm asking about a long lens.
Oh, long lens. Let me ask.

764
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:20,574
We're checking on that for you.

765
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:23,478
<i>Because that's a good idea.
Keep you safe.</i>

766
00:52:23,513 --> 00:52:25,810
[Bernard] Major. I can't
prevent that. Hold on.

767
00:52:25,845 --> 00:52:29,913
Major. We haven't even talked to this
guy yet, and you're letting them film him?

768
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:31,948
What are we doing here?
What is this?

769
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:35,556
What is what? You're
highly emotional, Sergeant.

770
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,725
Sir, my professional opinion?

771
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,793
This some bullshit.

772
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,531
May I start
a direct line of communication

773
00:52:43,566 --> 00:52:45,731
so someone trained in
this field can talk to him?

774
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:47,966
[officer] <i>I'm at North Park,
trying to divert traffic...</i>

775
00:52:50,441 --> 00:52:51,473
Just push redial.

776
00:52:54,544 --> 00:52:56,247
Yeah, I'm back.

777
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:58,678
<i>Suspect exits the bank,
he will not leave the sidewalk.</i>

778
00:52:58,713 --> 00:53:00,416
<i>Are you clear on that?</i>

779
00:53:00,451 --> 00:53:02,880
<i>Suspect exits the bank,
he will not leave the sidewalk.</i>

780
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:06,851
[Brian] Can you
send somebody down here?

781
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:11,955
Ma'am, ma'am,

782
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,562
I'm not going down there, okay?

783
00:53:14,597 --> 00:53:17,367
I do not wanna get sniped.

784
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,600
Okay, I kinda hear him
talking in the background.

785
00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:21,965
<i>He's still on
with the media, right?</i>

786
00:53:22,902 --> 00:53:24,000
Uh-huh.

787
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,573
We don't play that around here,

788
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:26,937
I'll tell you that much.

789
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:32,778

<i>Brian, calm down.</i>

<i>I need to be on camera, okay?</i>

[Lisa]<i> Yeah. Yeah.</i>

[breathing heavily]

796
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:00,311
Look, they're telling me

797
00:54:00,346 --> 00:54:03,512
that it's just going to take a minute to
locate the camera equipment we need.

798
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:05,712
But it's coming. Okay?

799
00:54:05,747 --> 00:54:07,351
You're lying.
<i>No, sir.</i>

800
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:08,990
You're lying to me right now.
I can hear you.

801
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:11,014
You're lying, I hear it
in your voice. <i>No. No.</i>

802
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:12,719
You know what,
we're gonna wrap this up.

803
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:14,325
<i>No, no, no.</i>
We're gonna wrap this up.

00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,494
Wait, my, uh...

God. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

807
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,829
That's all I've been told!

808
00:54:23,864 --> 00:54:25,061
Is to wait!
<i>Brian.</i>

809
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,700
What do I need to do

810
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:30,000
to get the attention
that I need right now?

811
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:31,507
Right now!

812
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:33,839
Right now, ma'am!

813
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:36,105
Brian. Brian, calm down.

814
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,646
<i>Calm down.</i>
Is this what I need to do?

815
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:40,648
<i>No. We're gonna...</i>

816
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:43,354
<i>We're going to take care...</i>
This what I need to do? Okay.

817
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,356
Okay.
[detonator beeping]

818
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:47,457
Is this what you need?

819
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:51,054
Is this all the motivation you
need to get me what I need?

820
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:53,397
You have hostages
in here, ma'am!

821
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:55,795
Hostages, and they scared!

822
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,995
They scared for their
damn lives! <i>Brian...</i>

823
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,503
I need a phone call!
<i>Brian,</i>

824
00:55:00,538 --> 00:55:02,769
you have my undivided attention.

825
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:05,772
I don't need
your undivided attention!

826
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,775
I need the attention of the VA!

827
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,414
Not you!

828
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:15,727
- [Riddick] Yeah, we're ready.
- [WSB staff] <i>All right. We're gonna do this.</i>

829
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:16,783
You got it.

you get me this phone call?</i>

<i>Hey, Brian...</i> Or do I
have to blow this bitch up?

833
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:29,961
<i>Brian, they just told me the negotiator wants
to call you on this line, like, right now.</i>

834

Negotiator
is on the phone, ma'am?

You're not lying to me
right now?

00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:35,967
The negotiator is
on the phone? <i>Yeah.</i>

837
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:38,706
'Cause we can't go back and
forth no more. We can't do that.

838
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:43,579
No, no, no. So... So... You go talk
to him. And then you call me back.

[detonator continues beeping]

840
00:55:47,816 --> 00:55:48,848
Okay.

00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,051
Okay, that's... that's a start.

843
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:55,525
That's a start.

844
00:55:58,629 --> 00:56:00,123
- Ring him through.
- Okay.

845
00:56:00,158 --> 00:56:02,026
Yeah.
She's doing it right now.

846
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,569
I apologize.

[Rosa crying softly]

848
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:17,943
What are we going to report?

849
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:20,077
Everything.

with Team 2 coverage from
our news chopper in the air,

854
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:33,959
and a team on the ground.

855
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:38,535
The suspect made exclusive contact
with our seasoned producer, Lisa Larson.

856
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,198
<i>This is</i> Channel 2 Action News. <i>We
start with Keith James live in Marietta.</i>

857
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:46,202
We appear to have a
very volatile situation here,

858
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:49,777
where a man has barricaded
himself inside a bank with...

859
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:54,881
<i>...an explosive device and a
story that he needs to have told.</i>

860
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:59,149
<i>Police are no longer calling this a
robbery, rather a hostage situation.</i>

861

the sheriff's SWAT team arrived.</i>

<i>Mark, what can you tell us
about the suspect?</i>

865
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:17,233
<i>Well, I can tell you
the area has been sealed off.</i>

866
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:21,578
<i>I've also been assured that
the public is not in danger.</i>

867
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:24,911
<i>Now, the suspect inside that
Wells Fargo told us he's a marine,</i>

868
00:57:24,946 --> 00:57:29,718

agencies to confirm that he is in fact</i>

[Bernard]
<i>Hi, is this Mr. Easley?</i>

884
00:58:49,096 --> 00:58:51,261
[Brian]
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

885

<i>This is Eli Bernard, chief

[Brian]<i> Chief?</i>
<i>Damn, they sent me the big dog.</i>

887
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,526
[Bernard] <i>I'm actually a
sergeant, but that doesn't matter.</i>

888
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,110
<i>I'm just pleased
to be talking to you.</i>

889
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:06,881
Why you pleased?

890
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,685
<i>I like to help people.</i>

891
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,248
<i>And it looks like
you can use some help today.</i>

892
00:59:11,283 --> 00:59:14,218
Yeah, you the chief.
Then we good, man.

893
00:59:14,253 --> 00:59:17,254
People know the truth
when they hear it. <i>I do agree.</i>

894
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:21,632
My mama said show me a liar
and I'll show you a thief.

895
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,832
[Bernard]<i> Mine said the same.</i>
Right.

896
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:28,100
<i>- Your mama sound like a smart woman.</i>
- Oh, she's smart. She was.

897
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,642
I'm sorry.
<i>No. No sorries.</i>

898
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:34,040
We all die
at our appointed time.

899
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:37,307
Yes, we do. So tell me, Brian,
what can I do for you today?

900
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:39,881
Is it okay if I call you
Brian? <i>Absolutely. Uh...</i>

901
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:43,412
<i>Sir, I know
you know why I'm here.</i>

902
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:47,185
<i>And I just simply want
my money back. That's all.</i>

903
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,825
From the VA, right?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

904
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,191
Yeah, I've had some problems
with Veteran Affairs myself.

905
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:56,898
It's difficult when they
drag their feet. <i>Right.</i>

906
00:59:56,933 --> 00:59:58,966
<i>Hey, what branch of service
you in?</i>

907
00:59:59,705 --> 01:00:00,935
Marine.

908
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,365
<i>Semper fi, sir.</i>

909
01:00:03,907 --> 01:00:05,808

Okay, okay. So you one

I'm from St. Louis,
Missouri.

918
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,727
But yes, sir,
a Hollywood marine I am.

919
01:00:24,994 --> 01:00:28,226
<i>So tell me, sir, how can we
put this back in the VA's hands</i>

920
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:29,997
<i>versus the bank tellers?</i>

921
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,035
[Brian]<i> Tell the VA to
send over the cash and fix it.</i>

922
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,773
<i>That's all, okay?</i>

923
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,007
[Bernard]<i> Anything else</i>
<i>you need help with?</i>

924
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,111
<i>Brian?</i>

925
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:50,721
Yeah, I need you to help me find the words
to tell my ex-wife and my daughter that...

926
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:53,922
that I'm gonna die.

927
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:58,124
[Bernard]
<i>Sir, with all due respect,</i>

928
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,457
<i>it is my responsibility to make
sure that you get out of here alive.</i>

929
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:03,162
Yeah, I understand,

930
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:05,769
but we both know they
going to kill me, man. They...

931
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:08,266
We both know I'm dying here.

932
01:01:09,368 --> 01:01:10,906
You know.

933
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,776
Ain't nothing for me out there
but bullets.

934
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:17,110
At least everybody gonna know.
They gonna know how the VA do, man.

935
01:01:17,145 --> 01:01:18,210
They gonna know.

936
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:20,817
Everybody will see.

937
01:01:23,283 --> 01:01:25,481
[Bernard] <i>You said you
had an ex-wife.</i> [chuckles]

938
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:29,353
<i>I got one of those
too. Painful.</i> [sniffs]

939
01:01:29,388 --> 01:01:32,356
<i>Anybody else in your life I
can contact?</i> Like a woman?

<i>Yeah.</i>

941
01:01:34,327 --> 01:01:37,526
<i>I had but one deep cut in
my life, and I married her.</i>

942

Well done you, sir.

943
01:01:41,466 --> 01:01:42,938
She beautiful.

944
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,404
Yeah, actually, uh,
I had thought about her...

945
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,881
right at the moment
I decided to do...

946
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:55,247
what I'm doing right now.

947
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:57,216

<i>When was that moment, Brian?</i>

955
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:17,533
No!
[officer] Okay.

956
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:19,942
I want my cash!
[officer] Take a breath.

957
01:02:19,977 --> 01:02:21,812
Where's my money?

[Brian]
<i>In front of all those brothers.</i>

960
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:36,486
I tried to go about it
the way we trained, but...

961
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,898
sir, they've taken
everything from me.

962
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:44,967
Everything.

963
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:48,806
I apologize.

964
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:51,303
<i>For what?</i>

965
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,439
Well, that... that another
human being, a fellow marine,

966
01:02:55,474 --> 01:02:57,573
<i>had to go through so much.</i>

967

<i>How much money
does the VA owe you?</i>

968
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:03,920
[Brian]<i> $892.34.</i>

969
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:07,617
That it?

970
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,860
[Brian]<i> Yes, sir.</i>

971
01:03:12,029 --> 01:03:15,162
[Bernard] <i>Sir, your honor's
worth more than $892.</i>

972
01:03:16,462 --> 01:03:19,331
You're worth more than $892.

973
01:03:20,037 --> 01:03:21,432
I'm worth nothing.

974
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:30,980
I am nothing.

975
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:36,117
I'm gonna die tonight...

976
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,154
and nobody will care why.

This is what we're going to do,
okay? Brother to brother.

981
01:03:56,238 --> 01:03:58,502
I'm gonna call your ex-wife
and daughter.

982
01:03:58,537 --> 01:04:01,439
I'ma tell her that we have talked
and we're going to work this out.

983
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:03,639
<i>Then I'm going to call you back.</i>

984

<i>Is that okay?</i>

985
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:08,248
Okay. <i>Now, after
I've done that, Brian,</i>

986
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:10,118
<i>I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor.</i>

987
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:13,121
I'm going to need you
to let one of the ladies go.

988
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:15,255
Can you do that for me?

989

<i>Brian, you still there?</i>

990
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:23,494
What about the cash?
What about the money?

991
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:27,036
I give my word as a marine
and on my daddy,

992
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,368
you let one of them go,
and we will sort this out.

993
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:33,944
They're gonna come in that door
and crack my head open.

994
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:36,947
Ain't nobody coming in there
and cracking open your skull, man.

No. No, no, sir.
Not on my word.

Nigga, please, you don't control these
people, man. You ain't got no power.

997
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:44,251
Don't do that to me now.
Don't you underestimate me.

998
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,220
Not me.

999
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:53,689
I'm gonna call your family and
I'll call you back in a moment.

1000

1001
01:04:57,596 --> 01:04:58,628
Okay.

1009
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:27,624
Hello? [Bernard]
<i>Hello, Ms. Easley.</i>

1010
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:29,571
<i>I'm Sergeant Bernard from
the Marietta Police Depart...</i>

1011
01:05:29,595 --> 01:05:31,100
Is he dead?

1012
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,662
<i>No. No, ma'am.</i>

1013
01:05:32,697 --> 01:05:35,005
<i>No, Brian is still
very much alive.</i>

1014
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:39,438
<i>Say, you got Face Time?</i>

1015
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:41,770
Yeah.
<i>I just want you to see me.</i>

1016
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:44,509
Uh, yeah, I do. I do. I do.
Hold on.

1017
01:05:46,216 --> 01:05:47,512
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1018
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:49,085
I am pressin' that button...

1019
01:05:50,451 --> 01:05:53,254
right about... now.

1020
01:05:53,289 --> 01:05:55,157
[chuckles]
<i>Hi.</i>

1021
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:58,226
I gotta tell you, I'm not too
much for all this technology,

1022
01:05:58,261 --> 01:06:00,261
but let's just say
it's a pleasure to see you.

1023
01:06:00,296 --> 01:06:01,757
Yeah.

1024
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,298
<i>First of all, I want to let
you and your daughter know</i>

1025
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:08,335
<i>I do this day in and day out, and I
know a good man when I see one.</i>

1026
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,634
<i>Your husband's a good man.</i>

1027
01:06:10,669 --> 01:06:14,407
Yeah. Yeah, I know that. I know that.
He wouldn't... He wouldn't hurt a spider.

1028
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:17,443
<i>He has these episodes,
sometimes,</i>

1029
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:19,775
<i>but nothing like this,
nothing this bad.</i>

1030
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,052
Has he ever been violent
towards you or your daughter?

1031
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:25,616
<i>Violent? No. No. Hell, no. He
loves that child with his whole heart.</i>

1032
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:27,585
[Bernard]
<i>That's good to know.</i>

1033
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,555
<i>And before I go, is there
anything I can help you with?</i>

1034
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,064
Yeah. Yeah, you can tell me why
the FBI is on their way to my house.

1035
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:36,429
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't do anything wrong.

1036
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:39,300
I apologize, ma'am.
That's just procedure.

1037
01:06:39,335 --> 01:06:41,137
This here's my number.

1038
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:43,601
If they do anything you
don't like, you just call me.

1039
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,372
Make sense?

1040
01:06:45,407 --> 01:06:46,538
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

1041
01:06:47,607 --> 01:06:49,739
<i>Is there anything
you want me to tell Brian?</i>

1042
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,642
Yeah.

1043
01:06:52,447 --> 01:06:54,282
Yeah, tell him that I...

1044
01:06:54,317 --> 01:06:57,813
Tell him that Kiah says,
"Don't do nothing stupid."

1045
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,685
<i>Okay, ma'am.</i>

1046
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,522
<i>I'll make sure
to pass that along.</i>

1047
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:05,689
All right. Thank you.

1048
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:08,527
<i>You're welcome.
Bye now.</i>

[phone rings]

1052
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:41,428
[Bernard]<i> Hey, Brian.</i>
<i>I spoke to your ex-wife, man.</i>

1053
01:07:41,463 --> 01:07:44,431
We actually video talked, but...
<i>Good, you did?</i>

1054
01:07:44,466 --> 01:07:45,696
She's a lovely lady.

1055
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:47,863
<i>They okay?</i>

1056
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,799
She and your daughter
are doing just fine.

1057
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:52,505
<i>Told Cassandra she can call me
if she needs anything.</i>

1058
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,672
That's mighty fine of you.
Did you call the VA too?

1059
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:56,707
<i>To tell the truth,
that's going to take some time.</i>

1060
01:07:56,742 --> 01:07:58,775
But I did
what I said I was going to do,

1061
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:02,251
so, how about you release
one of those ladies?

1062
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:05,452
I'ma release both of them
when the money's in my account.

1063
01:08:05,487 --> 01:08:07,784
I was really clear.
<i>You gave me your word, marine.</i>

1064
01:08:07,819 --> 01:08:10,193
Now don't do that.
Do not do that.

1065
01:08:10,228 --> 01:08:11,557
I did not reply, sir.

1066
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:13,724
Now, you got me there.
<i>Okay.</i>

1067
01:08:14,892 --> 01:08:16,364
It's just, uh,

1068
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,695
<i>I care about you, Brian.</i>

1069
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,730
<i>I care about you
just as much as I care about</i>

1070
01:08:19,765 --> 01:08:21,468
<i>what them ladies
must be going through.</i>

1071
01:08:21,503 --> 01:08:22,843
[Brian]<i> I understand</i>
<i>you're good at your job.</i>

1072
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,637
<i>But I need you to go do it.
Just call the VA.</i>

1073
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:31,247
[Bernard]<i> You went from</i>
<i>10% to 50% disability. Right?</i>

1074
01:08:34,384 --> 01:08:35,416
How you know that?

1075
01:08:36,518 --> 01:08:38,650
Well, the VA just
sent over your file.

1076
01:08:38,685 --> 01:08:41,158
<i>You were hurt in Iraqi Freedom.</i>

1077
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:43,886
[Brian]<i> Yeah, right again.</i>

1078
01:08:43,921 --> 01:08:46,460
[Bernard]<i> It is a bitch</i>
<i>getting shot in the heat.</i>

1079
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:49,760
<i>You... You were shot, right?</i>

1080
01:08:49,795 --> 01:08:51,333
No, I was injured.

1081
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:57,570
I was. Which means
you're just like me.

1082
01:08:58,474 --> 01:09:00,507
<i>You've been through worse.</i>

1083
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:03,774
<i>You just gotta push through,
Brian. I'll be here to help.</i>

1084
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:05,908
I understand
that you having conversations

1085
01:09:05,943 --> 01:09:08,559
that you're supposed to be having
with the VA, but what you need to do,

1086
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:09,923
rather than trying to
straighten me out,

1087
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:13,223
<i>is call them,
then have them call me.</i>

1088
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:15,786
Because you know what you did?
You gave me your word, sir.

1089
01:09:15,821 --> 01:09:17,854
You did that.

1090
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:21,429
So if that isn't the conversation,
then we don't need to talk.

1091
01:09:21,464 --> 01:09:23,233
<i>Come on, Brian.</i>

1092
01:09:23,268 --> 01:09:24,927
They taught us better than this.

1093
01:09:24,962 --> 01:09:28,337
No, no, no, no. <i>We can
fix this. This is human error.</i>

1094
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,570
I'm gonna die
because of that human error.

1095
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:31,637
Sleep on that.

1096
01:09:39,482 --> 01:09:40,514
Shit.

1097
01:09:48,953 --> 01:09:50,623
[Cassandra] I'm here, my baby.

[cell phone buzzes]

1099
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:55,342
[agent] Please don't
answer that. It's Brian.

1100
01:09:55,366 --> 01:09:58,565
There'll be a moment
when you can. Just not now.

1101
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,830
Hold on, baby.

1102
01:10:01,867 --> 01:10:03,867
[buzzing continues]

1103
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:06,870
[tosses phone]

1104
01:10:06,905 --> 01:10:08,245
Come here.

1105
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,452
I understand he is a local,
but I cannot confirm that.

1106
01:10:17,487 --> 01:10:19,421

[Bernard]<i> Hey, Brian.</i>
<i>Don't put the phone down.</i>

1110
01:10:40,642 --> 01:10:43,962
Since you didn't let those ladies out, you
can at least let me speak to one of them.

1111
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,483
Hold on.

1112
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:02,860
Negotiator wants to talk.

1113
01:11:06,503 --> 01:11:07,535
Estel.

1114
01:11:12,674 --> 01:11:14,003
Hello.

1115
01:11:14,038 --> 01:11:15,543
[Bernard]
<i>Hi, who am I speaking with?</i>

1116
01:11:15,578 --> 01:11:17,875
Estel Valerie.
<i>Hello, Ms. Valerie.</i>

1117
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:21,043
This is Sergeant Bernard.
Is everyone all right in there?

1118
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:23,881
[smacks lips]
No, we are not.

1119
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:27,555
What are you people
doing out there?

1120
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,359
<i>Ma'am, we're doing
everything we possibly can</i>

1121
01:11:29,394 --> 01:11:31,394
<i>to get y'all out of there
safely.</i>

1122
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:34,364
Well, how long does it take to
put money into a man's account?

1123
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,795
Estel, just please
try to stay calm.

1124
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:40,766
I'm perfectly calm.

1125
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,638
<i>Okay. We're trying, ma'am.</i>

1126
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:48,543
Well, try harder, please.

Lisa Larson. What's your tip?

1129
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:04,086
Absolutely.
Uh, what is your address?

[Brian]<i> Hello?</i>

I'm about to leave this car
and go over to the van.

1134
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:24,975
When I'm out there,
is there anything you'd like?

1135
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:28,814
Maybe some smokes?

1136
01:12:30,015 --> 01:12:31,784
Okay. I can do that.

1137
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:33,148
<i>What kind do you like?</i>

1138
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,689
Newports. Newport Longs.

1139
01:12:35,724 --> 01:12:37,493
Brian,
when I buy these cigarettes,

1140
01:12:37,528 --> 01:12:39,836
someone is going to have to
leave them at the door for you.

1141
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,596
We got a plan for that?

1142
01:12:41,631 --> 01:12:43,092
[Brian]
<i>Can't you do it?</i>

1143
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,602
Okay.

1144
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:50,797
You give me a few minutes to buy those
cigarettes, and I... I'll meet you there.

1145
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:53,773
[hangs up receiver]
[sniffs]

1146
01:12:53,808 --> 01:12:55,544
That's some bullshit.

1147
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:56,875
I ain't going near that.

1148
01:12:58,945 --> 01:13:00,417
You know what,

1149
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:02,584
they're not going to fix it.

1150
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,949
I will.

1151
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:08,183
I'm going to put your money
directly into your account.

1152
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:12,121
That's not what I need to
happen. So, no, thank you.

1153
01:13:14,697 --> 01:13:15,960
Money is money.

1154
01:13:17,766 --> 01:13:20,129
Why you care about
where it comes from?

1155
01:13:20,164 --> 01:13:22,912
If I cared about the money, I'd have had
you do that when I walked in, but I didn't.

1156
01:13:22,936 --> 01:13:24,573
So, no, I do not need that.

1157
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:27,004
You think the VA
got their own printed money?

1158
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:29,171
We're the bank.

1159
01:13:30,108 --> 01:13:31,206
We get it back.

1160
01:13:33,551 --> 01:13:34,913
No.

1161
01:13:34,948 --> 01:13:36,211
I want their money.

1162
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:42,118
So you set on dying?

1163
01:13:46,927 --> 01:13:49,829
How many times I gotta
hide my son from the news?

1164
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:54,669
I'll tell you what.

1165
01:13:55,838 --> 01:14:00,070
When he asks me, "What did
you do to stop him from dying?"

1166
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,746
I'm gonna look him in the eye...

1167
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,915
and know that I tried.

1168
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,091
[whispers] Please...

1169
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:26,965
[whimpering] ...let me put what
you're owed into your account,

1170
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,264
and let's please go home.

1171
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:35,611
Look, you can bump it
to your... your wife.

1172
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,778
Or your daughter.

1173
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:44,950
I don't care,
but I need you not to die.

1174
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:47,656
Okay, Brian?

1175
01:14:50,122 --> 01:14:54,091
Brian, I need you not to die.

1176
01:14:57,261 --> 01:14:58,766
Not today.

1177
01:15:02,299 --> 01:15:03,540
Okay.

1178
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:09,909
I'm gonna handle this. Right?

1179
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:14,815
I should probably...

1180
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,082
If I'm gonna
leave her something,

1181
01:15:18,117 --> 01:15:20,282
I should probably call
Kiah, right? Mm-hmm.

1182
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:22,185
You need some credit
on... on the phone?

1183
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,286
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Okay. That's on me.

1184
01:15:24,321 --> 01:15:27,025
Okay.
I'ma need that number, okay?

1185
01:15:35,904 --> 01:15:38,366
Estel might be losing it.

1186
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:41,138
I reckon she's going to take
matters into her own hands.

1187
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,778
Okay, well, that's a problem.

1188
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,012
We still got her
on the phone, right?

1189
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:49,311
Why is that a problem?

1190
01:15:49,346 --> 01:15:50,983
If he finds out

1191
01:15:51,018 --> 01:15:53,722
that she put the money
in his account and not the VA,

1192
01:15:54,285 --> 01:15:55,757
it just might trigger him.

1193
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,792
We don't know.

1194
01:15:57,827 --> 01:15:59,057
Hell, he doesn't know.

1195
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:02,830
Whoever is talking to her
should tell her to stop.

1196
01:16:02,865 --> 01:16:06,669
In fact, we should kill all bank
communications except for the phones.

1197
01:16:06,704 --> 01:16:08,902
[Riddick] Kill all comms
except for the phones.

1198
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:11,366
Let's go.

1199
01:16:15,746 --> 01:16:17,977
[typing on keyboard]

1200
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:26,282
I got the phone credit,
but your account...

1201
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:30,220
it's erroring.

1202
01:16:32,994 --> 01:16:37,227
Why... Why would they do that?
It just doesn't work?

1203
01:16:37,262 --> 01:16:38,162
Try again.

1204
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:40,263
[phone rings]

1205
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:44,300
Hello.
[Bernard]<i> Brian.</i>

1206
01:16:44,335 --> 01:16:46,247
- Man, why would you...
- Brian, look at your phone, man.

1207
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:47,336
You're on CNN.

1208
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,273
CNN?

1209
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:53,243
I'm on CNN?

1210
01:16:53,278 --> 01:16:56,081
<i>People are listening
to your story.</i>

1211
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:58,688
They got pictures of you
all over Facebook and Twitter.

1212
01:16:58,723 --> 01:16:59,854
Mm-hmm.

1213
01:17:01,022 --> 01:17:04,221
Okay, uh, what they saying?

1214
01:17:04,256 --> 01:17:06,190
[Bernard] <i>Well, they
know that you're angry.</i>

1215
01:17:07,325 --> 01:17:09,325
<i>Hell, most of them know
what's behind it.</i>

1216
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:13,032
<i>It ain't no secret
that the VA is fubar.</i>

1217
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,234
<i>You got them
on the back foot now, brother.</i>

1218
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:19,676
<i>You hear me?</i>

1219
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,338
So everything you say,

1220
01:17:22,373 --> 01:17:24,747
everything you do,

1221
01:17:24,782 --> 01:17:25,979
it matters.

1222
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:33,987
[Brian]
<i>I don't know that it does.</i>

1223
01:17:35,518 --> 01:17:38,156
<i>It matters. You matter.</i>

1224
01:17:40,226 --> 01:17:42,930
[Bernard] <i>Just make good
where you are right now.</i>

1225
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:46,230
Thank you for the call,
Hollywood.

1226
01:18:04,481 --> 01:18:06,349
[sighs]

1227
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,096
One of y'all can go.

1228
01:18:24,809 --> 01:18:27,139
[Lisa] <i>But it does say here
that he owed the college money.</i>

1229
01:18:27,174 --> 01:18:29,141
[person] It ain't,
though it says it is.

1230
01:18:29,176 --> 01:18:30,538
[Lisa] What does that mean?

1231
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:33,541
Once a student wants out,
stops showing up,

1232
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:35,884
school tells us
they're defaulting.

1233
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:39,052
- Meaning what?
- We gotta take their money.

1234
01:18:39,087 --> 01:18:41,219
Pension, disability,
whatever we can get.

1235
01:18:43,025 --> 01:18:45,289
The kicker is,
that wasn't Brian.

1236
01:18:45,324 --> 01:18:46,829
This is on them.

1237
01:18:48,327 --> 01:18:50,360
Why didn't the VA make it right?

1238
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:55,398
Give me a pack
of the Newport Longs.

1239
01:18:58,942 --> 01:18:59,974
6.50.

1240
01:19:02,011 --> 01:19:03,780
Uh, you got matches?

1241
01:19:07,082 --> 01:19:08,411
All right, listen up!

1242
01:19:08,446 --> 01:19:10,413
Prepare for a hostage release.

1243
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:12,052
Got ourselves a swap.

1244
01:19:12,516 --> 01:19:13,548
Got a light?

1245
01:19:15,519 --> 01:19:17,222
Got matches?

1246
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:19,092
I know you got a light.

1247
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:20,896
Does anybody have a light?

1248
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:25,461
Why don't you, uh, give him
a blowtorch while you're at it?

1249
01:19:26,497 --> 01:19:28,904
He has a detonator
attached to a bomb, sir.

1250
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:30,334
Not a stick of dynamite.

1251
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:36,043
SWAT command, let me know
when you're ready for hostage release.

1252
01:19:36,078 --> 01:19:38,507
[command] <i>32-01. All incoming
SWAT prepare for the exchange.</i>

1253
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:40,245
Guys! Hey, guys!

1254
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:42,951
[officer] Our bad!

1255
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:11,276
Now, ladies, we don't have
much time. You have to decide.

1256
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:15,115
- You can't put that on us. It's not fair.
- I know.

1257
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:19,988
Rosa, you can go. Go.

1258
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:21,154
No.

1259
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:24,223
Cannot leave you here.

1260
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:26,896
[sighs]

1261
01:20:27,624 --> 01:20:30,097
You got to decide.
I'm...

1262
01:20:30,132 --> 01:20:33,562
Well, I think it's probably best
I have a senior manager here,

1263
01:20:35,137 --> 01:20:36,873
you know, in case they try to...

1264
01:20:37,436 --> 01:20:39,403
They try to shoot me.

1265
01:20:47,017 --> 01:20:49,347
As soon as the cigarettes
are at the door,

1266
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:51,415
all three of us will go get it.

1267
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:55,221
Estel, I need you to open
the door, hold it open.

1268
01:20:55,256 --> 01:20:59,555
And, Rosa, I need you to grab
the cigarettes, pass it on back,

1269
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:01,062
move off.

1270
01:21:01,097 --> 01:21:03,658
Then, Estel,
you lock the door behind her.

1271
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,035
That clear?

1272
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,403
Okay.

1273
01:21:12,438 --> 01:21:13,602
Good.

1274
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:17,474
You hot?

1275
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:19,014
Not really.

1276
01:21:19,445 --> 01:21:21,115
No?

1277
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:24,349
I think I'm burning up.
Excuse me.

1278
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:06,556
Come on.

1279
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:10,197
Come on. Let's go.

1280
01:22:12,102 --> 01:22:13,530
We got to go.

1281
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:19,503
We got to go.

1282
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,476
You gotta be kidding me.

1283
01:22:25,511 --> 01:22:29,986
[line ringing]

1284
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:45,034
[Kiah]<i> Daddy?</i>

1285
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:47,498
Hey, Baby Ruth.
Hey. Hey, baby.

1286
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:53,405
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna be okay.

1287
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,574
You know, whatever happens...

1288
01:23:00,249 --> 01:23:02,150
and you gonna be okay.

1289
01:23:03,582 --> 01:23:05,516
<i>My baby gonna be fine.</i>

1290
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:08,222
Am I?

1291
01:23:08,257 --> 01:23:10,620
Baby, why would you not be?

1292
01:23:13,724 --> 01:23:17,363
You don't understand. You're
the most brilliant person I know.

1293
01:23:17,398 --> 01:23:18,463
<i>Yeah.</i>

1294
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,663
But Mommy says you in trouble.

1295
01:23:21,534 --> 01:23:23,270
Well, tell Mommy...

1296
01:23:29,278 --> 01:23:32,213
Tell Mommy
I'll be just fine. Okay?

1297
01:23:32,248 --> 01:23:33,808
<i>Now, you know what we do.</i>

1298
01:23:36,384 --> 01:23:38,219
Can you pray with Daddy?

1299
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:49,758
If he comes back out,
he will shoot me.

1300
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:53,201
If he had a gun,
we would have seen it by now.

1301
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:59,141
Rosa. Rosa.

1302
01:23:59,176 --> 01:24:00,835
Rosa, come on.

1303
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,178
- I can't.
- You the one supposed to be free.

1304
01:24:03,213 --> 01:24:04,608
Bitch, come on.

1305
01:24:05,578 --> 01:24:07,215
I can't move.

1306
01:24:12,651 --> 01:24:14,882
What the hell
is taking SWAT so long?

1307
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:16,719
They'll let us know
when they're set.

1308
01:24:32,374 --> 01:24:34,110
"Those that dwell...

1309
01:24:37,742 --> 01:24:40,116
in the shelter
of the Most High...

1310
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:43,845
<i>shall rest...</i>

1311
01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:51,160
shall rest..."

1312
01:24:54,891 --> 01:24:56,825
[crying]

1313
01:24:59,335 --> 01:25:00,862
[Kiah]<i> Daddy, breathe.</i>

1314
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:03,271
Okay, baby.

1315
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:06,934
[exhales]

1316
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:08,837
[Brian]<i> Okay, baby, okay.</i>

1317
01:25:13,712 --> 01:25:15,745
"I will say of the Lord...

1318
01:25:18,882 --> 01:25:20,816
He is my refuge...

1319
01:25:24,756 --> 01:25:26,228
my fortress...

1320
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:33,200
my God, in whom I trust.

1321
01:25:37,274 --> 01:25:40,836
Surely he will save me
from the fowler's snare...

1322
01:25:44,908 --> 01:25:46,941
and from the deadly pestilence."

1323
01:25:52,718 --> 01:25:53,849
Amen.

1324
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:56,621
[Kiah]<i> Amen.</i>

1325
01:25:59,395 --> 01:26:00,526
<i>Daddy...</i>

1326
01:26:02,299 --> 01:26:03,661
<i>are you breathing?</i>

1327
01:26:09,504 --> 01:26:10,734
I am, baby.

1328
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:11,966
I'm breathing.

1329
01:26:13,277 --> 01:26:14,672
I am.

1330
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:17,972
Thank you for your prayer.

1331
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,713
Thank you
for praying for me, baby.

1332
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:24,385
I needed that.

1333
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:26,618
<i>Daddy,</i>

1334
01:26:26,653 --> 01:26:28,686
can you get out of trouble?

1335
01:26:29,755 --> 01:26:31,788
<i>Oh, baby, you can always get...</i>

1336
01:26:34,628 --> 01:26:36,463
Just do right by people.

1337
01:26:38,698 --> 01:26:42,238
You understand me? Wherever
you go, you treat people good.

1338
01:26:44,374 --> 01:26:45,472
Okay?

1339
01:26:46,706 --> 01:26:48,002
[Kiah]<i> Yes, sir.</i>

1340
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:55,482
That's why I love you.

1341
01:26:57,387 --> 01:27:00,817
You're so cool. [chuckles]
<i>What did I do?</i>

1342
01:27:00,852 --> 01:27:01,983
Nothing.

1343
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:07,758
Daddy's gonna
let these women out now.

1344
01:27:08,926 --> 01:27:11,465
Then we gonna get my puppy?

1345
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,335
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

1346
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:16,338
I love you, Kiah.

[officer] <i>75-01, do you need
SWAT commander on your comm?</i>

1352
01:28:07,688 --> 01:28:09,919
Ladies,

1353
01:28:09,954 --> 01:28:14,495
I just wanna say thank you for everything
you've done for me the last few hours.

1354
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,093
And I'm very sorry.

1355
01:28:20,932 --> 01:28:22,668
I really am.

1356
01:28:28,412 --> 01:28:29,972
Fuck this.
We're gonna lose him.

1357
01:28:45,825 --> 01:28:47,858
Even though I don't pray often,

1358
01:28:47,893 --> 01:28:49,992
there's this book
I been reading...

1359
01:28:50,027 --> 01:28:51,631
[gunshot]

1360
01:28:51,666 --> 01:28:53,699
[officer]
What the hell was that?

1361
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:56,603
[gasping, exclaiming]

1362
01:28:56,638 --> 01:28:59,441
- [officer]<i> Shots fired.</i>
- [person] What was that?

1363
01:28:59,476 --> 01:29:02,609
[anchor]<i> And you are watching breaking
news with us, this scene unfolding...</i>

1364
01:29:02,644 --> 01:29:03,973
Go! Go! Go!

01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:07,812
[crying]

1366
01:29:11,048 --> 01:29:12,916
All right, move!
We're moving!

1367
01:29:19,496 --> 01:29:21,892

Come here. Come here.

Ma'am, come on.
Come on, ma'am.

1371
01:29:32,641 --> 01:29:35,708
- What was that?
- I think it was a rescue.

1372
01:29:35,743 --> 01:29:38,480
- Who authorized the rescue, Chief?
- You had hostages in there.

1373
01:29:38,515 --> 01:29:40,315
Find out what that was.
Was that a flash-bang?

1374
01:29:41,111 --> 01:29:42,913
Where are the hostages, Chief?

1375
01:29:42,948 --> 01:29:44,728
You said you wanted a peaceful
negotiation. What happened?

1376
01:29:44,752 --> 01:29:46,884
Look, we saw
a window of opportunity

1377
01:29:46,919 --> 01:29:50,085
and we made contact
trying to extract the hostages.

1378
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,559
Did you kill him?

1379
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:55,695
I have no further comment
on this matter.

1380
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:57,466

be available?

Yup.

1384
01:30:21,085 --> 01:30:22,590
Mm-hmm.

1385
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:23,756
Yeah.

1386
01:30:25,122 --> 01:30:26,594
Thank you.

We're on our way.

Excuse me.
Excuse me!

1389
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:34,569
Is he dead?

1390
01:30:35,902 --> 01:30:38,133
You'll have to contact
your local PD, ma'am.

1391
01:30:40,038 --> 01:30:41,609
[Cassandra] I have to what?

1392
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,139
Hello? I have to what?

1393
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:46,779
Sir!

1394

Excuse me, please.
Talk to me, sir.

Just talk to me.
Ma'am.

1396
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,754
Ma'am. Ma'am.
Did you kill him?

1397
01:30:54,789 --> 01:30:57,526
Ma'am. Ma'am!

1398
01:30:57,561 --> 01:31:00,892
You'll find he may have
turned the weapon on himself.

1399
01:31:08,198 --> 01:31:10,704

[anchor] <i>That must've
been so frightening for you.</i>

1404
01:34:24,394 --> 01:34:26,966
All I was doing, I think,

1405
01:34:27,001 --> 01:34:30,200
was just trying to
listen to him.

1406
01:34:30,235 --> 01:34:33,038
[anchor] You painted a
vivid image of this man...

[Kiah]<i> Dad! You can't name a
dog Gollum. It'll get to her head.</i>

1415
01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:23,412
Okay, I give in.
What's the name?

1416

Sam wise the brave.

1417

Sam wise the brave.

1418

That's perfect, baby.

1419

That is perfect.
