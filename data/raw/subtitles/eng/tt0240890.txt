1
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,560
Merry Christmas.

2
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,440
Excuse me.

3
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,800
- Wooh! Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

4
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,240
Do you want these?

5
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,640
- No. Please.
- You go ahead. It's the last one.

6
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,160
Uh, miss, do you have another pair
of these black cashmere gloves?

7
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,920
- Whatever's out is what we have.
- You don't have a stockroom?

8
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,360
- No. No. We don't have
an attic either.
- Or a basement?

9
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,520
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don't need 'em.

10
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,800
- No, no, no.
You saw them first. I--
- Please. I insist.

11
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,800
- Take them. Wait a minute.
- Oh! Oh!

12
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
- Excuse me, sir. These are ours.
- Yeah?

13
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,080
Oh. Your gloves? How come?
They're just sort of hanging there,

14
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,320
sleeping with their
little price tag on.

15
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,680
- We were just discussing
them, all right?
- Well, I have news for you.

16
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,760
You can go on discussing them
long after I've paid for them.

17
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
- Calm down, all right?
- Calm down? It's five days
before Christmas.

18
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm in the middle
of a New York department store.
He's asking me to calm down.

19
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
Well, these were meant to be
a very special gift for someone.

20
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,160
- Yeah, we put quite a lot
of thought into those.
- Isn't that right?

21
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,320
- Well, who were they for?
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.

22
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,640
- Her boyfriend.
- His girlfriend.

23
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
One pair of gloves
for two people?

24
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,080
- This is hard to explain.
- Try.

25
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,520
All right.
Go ahead.

26
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Oh. Uh, well, he is
at the present time my boyfriend.

27
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,360
But in 18 months--

28
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
After the operation--

29
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
- He will be--
- She will be--

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,320
My girlfriend.
Do you understand?

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,240
That didn't
really work out.

32
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,080
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.

33
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,520
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.

34
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,600
- Thanks. It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was. It was.

35
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,000
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Well--

36
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Ah, well.

37
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,920
They're ready for you guys.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
Thank you.

39
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't know what you said
to that guy makes any sense.

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,960
- But I think we scared
the be Jesus out of him.
- You were pretty fierce.

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,280
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.

42
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,040
But I'm serious about the check.
It's the least I can do.

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
Well, thank you, but, see,

44
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,760
now I have to go find
something else for my girlfriend.

45
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,160
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,120
- Oh, I can't accept them then.
- Well, you have to.

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
Otherwise you
won't treat. Really.

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,040
Let me tell you something.
This is the ultimate blend to drink.

49
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,960
- Where did you find this place?
- I first came in
because of the name.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
- Hmm.
- Serendipity. It's one
of my favorite words.

51
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
- It is? Why?
- Uh-huh.

52
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
'Cause it's such a nice sound for
what it means: a fortunate accident.

53
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,680
- Mm.
- Except I don't really
believe in accidents.

54
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,240
- I think fate's behind everything.
- Oh, you do?

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
- Yeah.
- Fate's behind everything?

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
- I think so.
- Everything's predestined?

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
- We don't have any choice at all?
- I think we make our own decisions.

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,520
I just think that fate
sends us little signs,

59
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,400
and it's how we read the signs
that determines whether
we're happy or not.

60
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,640
- Little signals. Yeah.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,320
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.
Columbus in America.

62
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,080
- Yeah, or Fleming
discovering penicillin.
- Penicillin.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,000
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
Or "Jonathan
and the Gloves."

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
- I don't know that one.
- You don't know that story?

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
It's an old
folk tale classic.

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out
in search of black gloves.

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,240
And in a perfect act
of "serendipiocity"
or "serendipaciousness,"

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,680
he runs into a beautiful, attractive
English girl with a boyfriend.

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,640
You have a boyfriend, right?

71
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,880
- Yeah, I do.
- That's what I thought.

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,920
- And you have the glove lady.
- Yes, I do.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,040
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a very nice time.

74
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,600
- Well, I hope you enjoy the
gloves you bought yourself.
- Oh, I'm sure I will.

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,800
I usually appreciate
my own thoughtfulness.
What do you want for Christmas?

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
- Golf clubs.
- Oh.

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,840
So you're gonna meet
your boyfriend now or what?

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,640
No, I think he's probably
out doing what you're doing.

79
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,200
Getting a crush on
someone else's girlfriend?

80
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,080
No, I'm sorry. I just meant to say
I had a really great time.

81
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,960
You know, maybe you should
give me your phone number,
you know, just in case.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.

83
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
I just had a great time, and I'd
never be able to find you again.

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,160
Well, if we're meant to meet again,
then we'll meet again.

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
It's just not
the right time now.

86
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,400
Maybe we were supposed
to meet on British time
and we're five hours too early.

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,040
Come on.
I don't even know your name.
My name is Jonathan.

88
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,600
- Does that make you
wanna tell me something?
- Yeah, it does.

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,920
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.
And thanks.

90
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,560
That's it?

91
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:10,075
- Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry about that.

92
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,810
- I think I left a scarf.

93
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,760
No. Nothing down here.
Why don't you go upstairs?

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,680
- Maybe it's still there.
- Thank you.

95
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,080
Hey.

96
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,440
Hey.

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
Let's go do something.

98
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,960
All right.
What you wanna do?

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
I don't care.

100
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,240
All right. Come on.

101
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,080
Now, promise me you're not
just visiting here for a week...

102
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,600
or marrying somebody
to get a green card or on parole.

103
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,800
None of the above. You?

104
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,880
No, no, no. Proud U.S. citizen.
No criminal record.

105
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,800
So you won't tell me
your name.

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,520
Well, tell me, uh, what do you
miss most about Mother England?

107
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
I miss my mom terribly.

108
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,040
If I were her,
I'd miss you too.

109
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,720
Okay. Favorite movie.

110
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,360
- The correct answer
is Cool Hand Luke.
- I've never seen it.

111
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,520
Oh, come on. You've never seen
Cool Hand Luke?

112
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Paul Newman?
Oh, my God. Come on!

113
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,240
"Failure to communicate."
Sadistic cop in sunglasses
with no name.

114
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
Reminds me of you
in that way.

115
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,480
Um, favorite
New York moment.

116
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,400
This one's
climbing the charts.

117
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm flattered.

118
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Is there anything else
you need to know about me?

119
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,200
Huh.

120
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,600
Favorite sexual position?

121
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
Oh!

122
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,760
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah, yeah. That's my favorite too.

123
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,720
- You all right?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,640
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No. Yes.

125
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,160
- You did?
Let's take a look at that.
- Ouch.

126
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,160
- Oh, Jesus.
That's a deep, deep gash.
- Gaping.

127
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,760
What? We'll
fix that right up.

128
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,600
There you go.

129
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,920
What? Oh, you're
looking at my freckles.

130
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,880
It's the curse
of the English, I'm afraid.
Fair skin and bad teeth.

131
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
No, you have great teeth.

132
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
Those aren't just freckles.

133
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,960
If you look closely,
you can see Cassiopeia.

134
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,360
- What?
- Right there.

135
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,240
Hold on a minute.

136
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,800
Okay. All right,
here's the story.

137
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
A long time ago in Ethiopia,

138
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,840
there was this queen
named Cassiopeia...

139
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,680
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world,

140
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,960
and there wasn't anybody in
the kingdom who wasn't offended...

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,360
by this woman's
relentless vanity.

142
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,040
And then one day, she really
screwed up and offended the gods.

143
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
I don't remember what she did and
I don't remember who she offended.

144
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,080
But it was bad.
She crossed the line.

145
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,320
But anyway, Poseidon, the sea god,
punished Cassiopeia...

146
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
by placing her in the heavens
upside down on her throne,

147
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders...

148
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,080
and all the blood
rushing to her head.

149
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,440
And now she's just
a constellation in the sky,

150
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,680
a bunch of English freckles
in the shape of a throne.

151
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,480
So she made
one tragic mistake.

152
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,440
And paid for eternity.

153
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,360
Correct.

154
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,840
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Legible, legible.

155
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,080
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Now, please, please.

156
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,000
Let fate take
its proper course.

157
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh!

158
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,800
- That was an accident.
Write down that again, please.
- I can't.

159
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,680
That was a sign.

160
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Fate's telling us
to back off.

161
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,960
If fate didn't want
us to be together, then why
did we meet tonight, huh?

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,960
- Gotcha.
- Well, I don't know.

163
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,320
- But it's not an exact science.
It's a feeling.
- Well, what if you're wrong?

164
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,480
Huh? What if it's all
in our hands and we just walk away?

165
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,240
No names, no phone numbers, nothing.
What do you think's gonna happen?

166
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,360
Do you think good old fate is
just gonna deliver my information...

167
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,320
- right to your doorstep?
- Do you know that's the best
idea you're had all night?

168
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,360
- What's the best--
- Here you go. Write
your name and number down.

169
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,920
- On a $5.00 bill?
- Mm. Just do it.

170
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,160
You are a strange
and interesting woman.

171
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,520
Now what?

172
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
Wait there.

173
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,560
Hey!

174
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,280
What the hell was that?

175
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,080
When that $5.00 bill
makes it back into my hands,
I'll be able to call you.

176
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,240
And when you hear
my voice on the other end,

177
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,680
then you'll believe
in fate, won't you?

178
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,520
- Hey, what about me?
- What do you mean?

179
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,960
Well, we have to send
something out in the universe
with your name on it, don't we?

180
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,720
- Come on. Isn't that
the only fair thing?
- That is the only fair thing.

181
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,480
What have I got, even?
Ooh. No. I have a really good idea.

182
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,280
- What?
- Okay.

183
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,120
- That's a lot of tuba.
- Okay, see this book?

184
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
Yeah.

185
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,640
Okay, so when
I get home tonight,

186
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,560
I'm gonna write my name
and number inside this book.

187
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
And then first thing
tomorrow morning, I'll sell it
to a used book store.

188
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,760
Which one?

189
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,920
You're not gonna tell me.
You're not gonna tell me. Why not?

190
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,840
Well, now, every time
you go past an old book store,

191
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
you're gonna have to go inside
to see if it's there.

192
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,760
This is just wrong.
You don't just have the most
incredible night of your life...

193
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,960
with a perfect stranger and then
leave it all to chance, do ya?

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,640
- Do ya?
- Come with me a second.

195
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,840
What, we're gonna get a room?

196
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,280
I'm kidding.
But I wanna know you more.

197
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,000
- Come on. Where are we going?
- Okay.

198
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,320
- Now, you stay here.
- Okay.

199
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,720
- No, stay here. Stay there.
Don't make me come over there.
- Okay.

200
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,240
All right, if we both
randomly pick the same floor,
we're meant to be together now.

201
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,000
You're insane.

202
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,440
Come on.
Okay, get in.

203
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,400
Take a breath, and then
when the door closes, hit a button.

204
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,920
- I don't understand this.
- You don't have to understand.
You just have to have faith.

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
Faith in what?

206
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,200
Destiny.

207
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,520
Hey!

208
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,840
It's Sara.
My name's Sara.

209
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,000
And here it is.
See? You were right.

210
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
- Uh--
- Let's go, buddy.

211
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,760
- We're going up here.
- Oh, that's okay.
Josh likes to ride either way.

212
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,960
Don't you, Josh?

213
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Don't do that!
Don't touch those!

214
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
Hey, calm down.
He's just a kid.

215
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,440
Looks like we've stopped.

216
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,240
- We're going again.
- Thank you.

217
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,360
Where is she? Is she here?
- No, no. I don't think so.

218
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,640
Come on, Josh.
Let's go, buddy.

219
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,320
Okay, stay alert.

220
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Is she here?

221
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,160
- No, not here.
Back in the elevator.
- She's not here?

222
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,600
- Come on! Come on!
Move it! Come on, boy!

223
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,960
Hey, Sara. I'm sorry.

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,520
- Hey. I'm sorry.
- What?

225
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
I usually have to
beg to be a part of weddings.

227
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,120
And if I do get into the wedding,
of course they postponed it,

228
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,480
and it's overseas somewhere,
and they've canceled my passport,

229
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,360
and I can't be a part of it,
and it's ridiculous
and awkward and horrible.

230
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,720
So thank you.
I take this very seriously.

231
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,600
It's a gift
to be the best man.

232
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,120
They say that once in your lifetime,
someone comes along...

233
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,280
whom you're absolutely
meant to be with.

234
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,360
Everything feels great,
stars are aligned,

235
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,560
body and spirit
are in balance.

236
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,080
Formy friend
Jonathan Trager,

237
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,920
that person was me.

238
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,720
But as you know,
Jonny and I were simpatico.

239
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,640
We were brothers
from another mother.

240
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,640
We were friends
since freshman year.

241
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,800
I watched him go out
with woman after woman,
and he'd always come crawling--

242
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,760
he would come crawling
back to me.

243
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,240
- It was embarrassing.
- You loved it.

244
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,600
But then one night he came home
and things were different.

245
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,640
His adolescent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker
was a thing of the past.

246
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,320
- Thank God.
- He hardly even responded...

247
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,280
to my playful yet tormented
flicks of my finger...

248
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,400
against the soft part of his skull
as he studied for finals.

249
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,080
And that is because
he had found her.

250
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,440
The woman he was meant to be with.
And if anyone is qualified...

251
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,560
to know when he met his soul mate,
it would be me, his first wife.

252
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,560
She's smart, she's funny,
she's beautiful.

253
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,320
In short, she's the kind of woman
that any man would dream about.

254
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,800
And I think we all have.
So it is with sadness...

255
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,640
and fond, fond memories...

256
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,400
that I raise my glass...

257
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,320
to the new
Mrs. Jonathan Trager.

258
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,240
I'll tell you what.

259
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
I'll tell you something. My friends,
if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,

260
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,600
I can't imagine
a more perfect woman than Halley.

261
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,360
Cheers to both of you.

262
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,680
- How drunk is he
on a scale of one to ten?
- Twelve.

263
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
You think we'll ever out-romance
Dean and Courtney?

264
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,480
- I don't know. I don't think
I've ever seen them fight.
- Me neither.

265
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,760
Must be a bitch
on their sex life.

266
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,960
We have a pomegranate soufflé
which is amazing, which is
different than the sorbet.

267
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Listen, we'd love
to join you guys,

268
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,560
but Courtney has to wake up,
so I got to be good.

269
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,880
Halley, listen to me.
It's not too late to back out.

270
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,080
- Good night, Dean.
- And I'm at 166th and--

271
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,040
Good night, Courtney.

272
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,720
Mama, you don't want to see this.
I need-- I need to snuggle.

273
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,560
- I'm gonna go sleep it off.
Listen, you're wonderful.
- Good night.

274
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,920
- You know what? You need me.
- Take care. Come on, hon.

275
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,800
You guys, listen, I hate to
tell you, but I gotta go home too.

276
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,720
I have to. I gotta get up
at 8:00 in the morning.
My day is crazy tomorrow.

277
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,120
- Come in for one drink.
- He doesn't want to come.
He doesn't have to come.

278
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,320
- I'll see you in about 20 hours.
- Bye-bye, dear.

279
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
- I love you, son.
- Night-night.

280
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,280
- George.
- Take care.

281
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,080
You okay?

282
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,520
- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?

283
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,360
- Because I'm gonna come home
and get undressed...
- Uh-huh?

284
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,400
- and climb into bed,
- Uh-huh?

285
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,520
act like we just got
over a terrible fight.

286
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,800
See you later now.

287
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
Reading is good for you.
Knowledge.

288
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,880
Reading?

289
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,080
- Hold on, hold on. Listen, listen.
- I read it a long time ago.

290
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,720
- I'll throw in the screenplay to
The Bridges of Madison County.
- I saw the movie. It was great.

291
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Okay, and--

292
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,880
And nothing. I mean--
I mean, I did nothing.

293
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,600
I-- I just let her
walk out of the party
and I didn't say anything to her.

294
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,160
And now she's gone forever.

295
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,840
I mean,
she was my soul mate.

296
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,600
Kenny, I honestly
think it's dangerous
to use the term "soul mate."

297
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,640
It implies there's
some magical element
that we have no control over,

298
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,040
like fate or destiny.

299
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,400
I think holding on to beliefs like
that stops us doing the real work.

300
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,160
And the fact is,
if your therapy stays on track,

301
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,640
I think you'll find there
are many, many people out there
you could easily be happy with.

302
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
You truly believe
all that, Sara?

303
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
Yeah. I really do.

304
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,920
- There you go.
- Thanks.

305
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,200
You got to say yes, first.

306
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Yes.

307
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,880
- Wait a second.
- Ow!

308
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
- Let me-- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- I got it. I got it.

309
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,800
- Ow, ow. Ow!
- I got it.

310
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,520
Okay, you're not gonna
read into this, right, Sara?

311
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,160
- I mean, it's just
an accident, nothing more.
- No.

312
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,320
God. We'll
get it refitted.

313
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,920
It's beautiful.
I love it.

314
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,160
You-You get changed.
I'm gonna call Ryan,
tell him you said yes.

315
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,880
- Why? Was he worried?
- Not about you. About the tour.

316
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,280
He's hoping to fit the honeymoon
into the schedule.

317
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,080
How does Bora Bora sound?

318
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,200
Very... sexy-sexy?

319
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,560
Now, if you're a golfer
on a one-hour lunch break,

320
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,480
you'd use that time up
just getting to the nearest
course out of Manhattan.

321
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,760
All this was
a long overdue solution.

322
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,320
Formerly a dilapidated pier
and converted just five years ago,

323
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,560
the range offers the inhabitants
of this concrete jungle...

324
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
the chance to keep
their drives straight,
their short games accurate...

325
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,000
and most of all, brings the joys
and frustrations of golf...

326
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,920
back to city folk.

327
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,640
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.

328
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,000
Superb, Nick.
We got it. Thank you.

329
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,520
- Artie, I gotta run, okay?
- What about the B-roll shot?

330
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,440
Paging Sara Lawson.
Paging Sara Lawson.

331
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,320
- Please come to the front desk.
- Could you come back and get
the B-roll on Friday?

332
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
- Yeah. Whatever you say, boss.
- Thank you, sir.

333
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,000
- I'm Sara Lawson. Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
- How are you?

334
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,440
You're down
at position number two.

335
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,320
Oh, right. Bad golfers
all the way down there, right?

336
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,480
Dude, take off.
We got it.

337
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Well, hello,
Mr. Marrying Man.

338
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,640
- Hi. Uh, where's Lauren?
- Oh, Lauren took the day off.

339
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,280
My name is Sara
and I'm gonna cut your hair today.

340
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,240
You know what?

341
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,920
I'm not thrilled with having
that "just cut hair" look
for my own wedding, so--

342
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,000
- I'll just take a little bit off.
- I gotta live with these pictures
the rest of my life.

343
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,140
- Just a little bit.
- Please, you know, uh--

344
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:47,223
<i># It's you</i>

345
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,822
<i># And me forever</i>

346
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:56,514
<i># Sara, smile</i>

347
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:00,702
<i># Won't you smile
a while for me</i>

348
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,200
Forget Charles Street.
Take me to the New York Times
building on 42nd, please.

349
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,440
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Whoo!

351
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,840
I'm telling you,
I keep running into her.

352
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,480
I keep finding it.
It keeps happening.
She was at the golf range.

353
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
She's a big girl now with big hips.
All right?

354
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
Then I gotta leave
'cause Sara's gonna cut my hair,

355
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,760
And the guy in the taxi,
he's serenading me, "Sara."

356
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,400
I'm telling you, the universe
keeps revealing her to me,

357
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,040
- screwing with my head.
- You're getting married
in three days.

358
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,560
- That's my point.
- It's entirely duplicitous.

359
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,760
Think about it. Why would you risk
your relationship with Halley...

360
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,880
- just to search
for some pipe dream?
- Just hear me out, man.

361
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm sure that
I love Halley, all right?

362
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,920
And maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody,

363
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
it's a completely
different experience.

364
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,200
So it's a mistake to compare them.
I get it, but--

365
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,160
All right.

366
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,520
It's like Halley is
The Godfather, Part II.

367
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
She's what?

368
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,160
Godfather, Part II.
That was an incredible movie.

369
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,080
Might be better than the original.
All right?

370
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,000
But no matter how much you love
The Godfather, Part II,

371
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,920
you still have
to see the original...

372
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,960
to understand and appreciate
the sequel, don't ya?

373
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,200
Come on. Is it too much to ask from
my oldest friend to help me out?

374
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,240
- You've already got
the fairy-tale marriage.
- I'm the best man.

375
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,160
You work in the biggest
newspaper in the world.
Help me find her.

376
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,360
Let me tell you something.
Contrary to popular New York myth,

377
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,280
the Times
is not omniscient.

378
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,200
I need a last name.
I need a social security number.

379
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,920
- If we find the book--
- It-It-It's a dead end.
You know that.

380
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
- Unless we search every
book store in New York.
- You did that.

381
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,560
- Years ago. Do you remember?
- Maybe I missed a store.

382
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
- Maybe somebody bought it
and sold it back.
- You know what?

383
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,760
I don't want any part of this.
All right?

384
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,880
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.

385
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,680
I'm telling you right now,
British women do not age well.

386
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,720
You know, I mean, years ago,
yes, she was a luscious treat.

387
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,000
You know, she probably looked like,
you know, Baby Spice.

388
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,880
But now
she could look like--

389
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,880
Old Spice.

390
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,760
- It's a great haircut.
- Oh. Thanks.

391
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,800
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

392
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,440
- Tell me something romantic.
- Like what?

393
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,200
I don't know. Like...

394
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,880
how I'm the only girl in the
entire universe meant for you.

395
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,760
Oh, my God, the dinner!

396
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,840
By the way, I emptied your closet.
We gotta pack for the honeymoon.

397
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,880
God, I hate this building.

398
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,200
Shut up!

399
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,200
Don't hit it with the thing.

400
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,840
- Jon!
- What?

401
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm gonna go yell
at the super.

402
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,760
I don't understand
why this is going off.

403
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,080
- You said last week
it would be fine.
- Hey, Jon.

404
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,520
This place looks like
a disaster area.

405
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,120
- Thanks, Gerald.
- Gerald, it's in here.

406
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,520
I gotta get going.
Coming!

407
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,160
Come on! I wanna see!
I wanna see!

408
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,920
I thought you wanted
a round-cut diamond.

409
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,600
- Why? When did I say that?
- I'm not exactly sure.

410
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,200
- But when we were younger, I think.
- Oh, God.

411
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,560
When I was younger, I was gonna
marry Boris Becker, wasn't I?

412
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,280
- Hey, guys. What did you think?
- Hey!

413
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,720
Well, I mean, was that last song
really inspired by my sister?

414
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,640
Every artist
needs his muse.

415
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,280
- Who wants to hear the good news?
- Hey, I pay you for the good news.

416
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,240
No. You pay me
to keep away the bad news.

417
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,720
- Bring it on.
- Lars' dates in Stockholm
sold out in eight hours.

418
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,840
Wow!

419
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,520
That means we're gonna
have to add some more shows.
So we'll bump Paris--

420
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,400
Sorry. I don't wanna
spoil anyone's party,

421
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
but Lars and I have
already set the dates
for our honeymoon and our wedding,

422
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,040
and I've told my patients
when I'm going.

423
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,960
Well, baby, your patients can do
without you for a couple weeks.

424
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,600
He's right, Sara.
I mean, a couple of extra weeks
in Europe aren't gonna kill you.

425
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,600
Caroline's just pushing you
to stay longer...

426
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,080
'cause she wants us
to house-sit for you guys.

427
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,120
Yeah, thank you.
I was going to ask her
when she was drunk.

428
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,760
- Actually, that's a great idea.
- Yeah?
- Yes!

429
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,320
Come on, Kip.
Let's get out of here
before Sara changes Lars' mind.

430
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,200
- I said something wrong?
- No, it's--

431
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,160
I've just got
a very detailed schedule...

432
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,160
and my patients
are important too.

433
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,720
- I don't like changing
the dates at the last minute.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

434
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,440
But I really need you to approve
these T-shirt designs for Australia.

435
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,360
- Oh, no problem.
- You don't mind, do you?

436
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,280
- Can we do this later?
- Yeah.

437
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,240
She don't mind.

438
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,080
That's chamomile
for you ladies.

439
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,000
- Nice and hot. Very good.
- Thanks.

440
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,280
Sara, it was a movie poster.
It's no big deal.

441
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,200
It's peculiar though, right?
Don't you think?

442
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,520
Look, I thought you were through
with all this New Age bullshit...

443
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,440
like horoscopes and feng shui
and all the crap.

444
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Eve, for someone
who owns a New Age store,
you are alarmingly earthbound.

445
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,640
Oh, yeah? And for
a shrink-in-training,
you are a little bit crazy.

446
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
- I'll tell you that much.
- Excuse me.

447
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,120
- Do you carry the Casanova candle?
- As a matter of fact, we do.

448
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,120
Check on the shelf across
from the Caligula incense.

449
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,680
And they're on sale,
so today's your lucky day.

450
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,800
Great. You see,
that is what happens...

451
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,720
when people get hooked
on the New Age life.

452
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,960
They end up sitting at home
burning candles for Mr. Right...

453
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,840
when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now
is waiting at the corner bar.

454
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,320
- Hi. Oh, yeah.
She's a pain in the ass.

455
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,200
- And I gotta find her.
- I've been here three years,
so this is--

456
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,600
Yeah, I understand.
But your computer system
has been here for a long time.

457
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,000
- I think-- I think you're
just wasting my time, sir.
- No, no.

458
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,920
- Here's the thing.
- There's nothing I can do.

459
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,840
- It's very crucial.
- You cannot be over here.
You cannot come over...

460
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,760
- to this side of the counter.
- All right.

461
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,080
- Please don't cross this line.
Thank you.
- All I really need...

462
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,960
is if you can enter this
account number in the computer...

463
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
- and just tell me her name.
- Oh, I see.

464
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,880
When you put it
that way, no.

465
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,240
- Would 20 bucks help?
- It might if I was
a health inspector.

466
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,480
- Listen, this is really important.
- Oh, boy, did it again.

467
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,840
Crossed the line. You have to remain
on the other side of the register.

468
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't wanna say it again.
Remain on that side. Thank you.

469
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,640
Let's bottom-line this, huh?
What's it gonna take?
I have to have the name.

470
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,520
Well, I was a little short
on my weekly sales draw.

471
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,440
- Were you?
- I'm just mentioning.

472
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,000
Okay. Um, I'm going
to, uh--

473
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
- Uh-uh.
- Look where my feet are.

474
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,800
Allright?

475
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
- Lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.

476
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,440
Account number
was 029351--

477
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,800
I thought you said you were gonna
help with my weekly draw.

478
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,880
The tie's worth $95.
We're still 700 short.

479
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,200
- $700? That's extortion.
- 700.

480
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,800
That's good
salesmanship, sir.

481
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
What do I need?

482
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,720
Ring it up.

483
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,200
- Well, we have a purple tie.
What would go with a purple tie?
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,360
I look like a magician.

485
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,760
All right,
you horrible little man.

486
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,320
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?

487
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,680
- Now, look her up.
- I already did.

488
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,640
It was a dead account.
There's no information
in our computers.

489
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,560
- You give me that?
- Hey, chase me.

490
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,480
- Chase you? What? Are you insane?
- Don't cross the line!

491
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,840
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that
or I will cut you!

492
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,880
Now, you better find a way
to help me right now!

493
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,240
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.

494
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,160
When our customers
apply for a credit card,

495
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,720
the hard copies go to our
storage facility in Queens.

496
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,120
All you need is the account number,
which you already have,

497
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,040
and you can find
her application.

498
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,320
However, you need
an employee to get you in.

499
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,200
You need an employee...

500
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,160
to get you in.

501
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,680
Crocodile.

502
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,240
Hal.

503
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
Halley.

504
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,840
A natural.

505
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Really natural.

506
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,480
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut.
- What's the problem?

507
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,520
The problem is you can't fend
off an army of blood thirsty
Vikings with a shehnai.

508
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,800
- It's illogical.
- No, see-- No, no.

509
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,600
You're lulling them
into submission with the music.

510
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,040
That's the whole point
of the song, really.
"Mystic Surrender."

511
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,320
You don't think he looks
like he hates the music?

512
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,560
No. Hey.

513
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,440
Hey, baby.

514
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,240
- Now, this guy, he's-he's like
Alec Guinness. So good.
- Yeah.

515
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,000
Star Wars.
Obi-Wan.

516
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,120
All right, right here,
what are they doing?
What's their attitude?

517
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,520
- What are they thinking?
Who are these people?
- They're in awe and speechless.

518
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,920
And they're just grateful.
Underfed. Underpaid.

519
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,920
Why don't they ask me to stay
in the village and have a feast?

520
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,800
Yeah. Sara, hey.

521
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,720
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.

522
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,640
Okay, yeah, I'm going
to split, guys.

523
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,240
Lars, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna talk to the director...

524
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,960
and I'm gonna have him
tweak that whole section.

525
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,120
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.

526
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,560
- What's going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.

527
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,000
- Oh, that's a drag.
- And I've just
found them in the freezer.

528
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,320
I don't get it.
Is that a joke?

529
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,240
No, Lars,
it's not a joke.

530
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,160
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

531
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,000
It's the wedding plans
and the tour and my patients.

532
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,960
It's just a bit
too much to deal with.

533
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,960
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving
for Toronto in the morning,

534
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,640
- so don't fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know.

535
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,760
And that's why I think
I need a little break.

536
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,160
What do you mean,
a little break?

537
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,080
No, not that kind
of little break.

538
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,880
I just mean a weekend away
to recharge my batteries
and clear my head.

539
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,960
Hey, this has nothing
to do with the other night.

540
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,480
I just need this.
I need it for me.

541
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,760
But I won't go
unless you say it's okay.

542
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,040
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

543
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,800
Okay. Where are you going?
Where are you going?

544
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,240
Oh, I don't know.
New York, maybe.

545
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,000
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.

546
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,440
Are you serious?
Get out of town.

547
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,400
Yeah, that's the idea.

548
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
- Thanks. Talk to you soon.
- Okay.

549
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,280
This is unbelievable.

550
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,720
Sara, really, this is
way too generous of you.

551
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,200
Oh, come on.
Can't a girl do something nice
for her friend on her birthday?

552
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,120
There's no ulterior motives?

553
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,280
Well, yeah.

554
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,680
I'm getting married in a week
and I'd just like to have
one last fling...

555
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,600
with my best friend
before I walk down the aisle.

556
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,280
- It's so sweet. But, you know,
you're really not my type.
- Oh, thanks.

557
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,360
- We're going to New York?
- Yeah. Yea!

558
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,600
Hey! Excuse me.

559
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,960
- Why so tense?
- Because you're
freaking me out, all right?

560
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,960
- Is there another space
you can be in?
- Oh. Excusez-moi.

561
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,280
- Uh-huh.
- And what is it you do?

562
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,320
Why, my sales clerk friend,
I happen to write for
a little publication.

563
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,080
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called the New York Times.

564
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,440
- Oh.
- Yeah.

565
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,680
Hello. Who?

566
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,480
Dean? And who may
I say is calling?

567
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,680
Huh? Hang on.
Your editor.

568
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,760
Hi. No.

569
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,120
Didn't get a chance
to write that one. Uh--

570
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,000
Didn't write
that one either.

571
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,200
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
they'll all still be dead tomorrow.

572
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,960
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.

573
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,760
- You write for the obituaries.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

574
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,200
- You must be very proud.
- Uh-huh. I'm the one
with the last word.

575
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,560
- Not tonight. I don't think so.
- Yes, I am. Absolutely.

576
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,000
- Fat chance. Last line.
- Still talking. Yeah, right here.

577
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,640
I don't know. I don't know.
My eyes are killing me.

578
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,560
- Tell me these numbers match.
- I'll tell you.

579
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,480
- Let me see.
- Don't do that.

580
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,440
- Ah-ah!
- Is it 0293?

581
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,280
0293.
Congratulations.

582
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,200
- You got it?
- I think you found her.

583
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,600
Too bad the last name's
completely smudged out, though.

584
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,840
Well, it's his fault.
It was his thumb.

585
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,040
When he grabbed it, his thumb
went right across the name.

586
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,200
Completely. I'm kidding.
It was smudged in my hand.

587
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,600
- Would you stop it?
- It's just a little joke.
That's carbon paper for you.

588
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,040
I guess that's why
America rejected it.

589
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,400
- What's that address?
Is that her address?
- That's seven years ago, man.

590
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,440
So go to the building
leasing office...

591
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,360
and you'll find out
who lived there seven years ago.

592
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,760
It ain't rocket science.

593
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,680
Thank you.

594
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,840
- Hi.
- Hey.

595
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,760
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?

596
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,800
- Uh, okay, take us...
anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?

597
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,720
Anywhere. Wherever
you feel like going.

598
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,360
- That's not a destination, lady.
- Wait. You didn't make reservations?

599
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,800
- Um, okay, Eve, please
don't get mad at me.
- What?

600
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,320
Oh, no.
I cannot believe this.

601
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
I need
a borough here, ladies.

602
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,880
I was gonna tell you
when we got on the plane.

603
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,240
You know what?
That's really sneaky of you, Sara.

604
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,480
- I'm not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait!

605
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,440
Wait!

606
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,880
- Eve. Eve!
- You tricked me.

607
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,560
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.
I needed my best friend with me.

608
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,160
What are you doing, Sara?

609
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,080
Honestly, Sara, I don't
understand you anymore, okay?

610
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,640
Please, tell me something.

611
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,560
Tell me anything that makes
just a little bit of sense.

612
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
I've just spent
the entire flight...

613
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,960
staring into the sky,
thinking.

614
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,560
Not about my fiancé,
but about this mystery guy...

615
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,440
I met a million
and a half hours ago.

616
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,800
A guy I don't even remember,
except for this...

617
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,240
vague picture I have
inside my head.

618
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,720
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.

619
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,320
And it was like...

620
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,600
in that moment,

621
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,000
the whole universe existed
just to bring us together.

622
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,160
That's why I'm here.

623
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,320
That's why I'm gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go.

624
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,720
Because when all this is over,
at least I'm never gonna have
to think of him ever again.

625
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,120
Let's just pray
he's a bald fascist...

626
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,360
who picks his nose
and wipes it under the car seat.

627
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

628
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,760
Could you hold on?

629
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,920
Where are you going?

630
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,840
You better be buying me one
frigging big birthday cake,
that's all I gotta say.

631
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,760
Could I get your
destination, please?

632
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,520
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.

633
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,000
Okay, we are going...
that way.

634
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,240
And I'm gonna follow.

635
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,120
You can do it yourself. Just open up
the computer and look into it.

636
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,480
- I'm not even sure that I can
give you this information.
- If you can't, why can't you?

637
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,920
Because I'm just a temp, okay?
I don't know the rules.

638
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,320
Couple of months out of college,
you're acting like you're
part of the establishment.

639
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,000
No, no, no, no, no--
What about privacy law, huh?

640
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,400
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?

641
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,000
- No.
- They protect millionaires.
Do you know who those are?

642
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,920
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.

643
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.

644
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,400
Pimple-faced college dropouts who
have made unhealthy sums of money...

645
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,240
forming Internet companies
that create no concrete products,

646
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,080
provide no viable services and still
manage to generate profits...

647
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,640
for all of its lazy, day-trading,
son-of-a-bitch shareholders.

648
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,960
Meanwhile, as a tortured member
of the disenfranchised proletariat,

649
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,360
you find some altruistic need
to protect these digital
plantation owners?

650
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
Wow. Come on.

651
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,360
Come on.

652
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,080
- You guys want the tenant
on record in 1994?
- December, to be exact.

653
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,000
- There's your tenant.
- Sebastian Mig-non?

654
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,880
No. Mignon.
It's French.

655
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,920
No, we're looking
for someone named Sara.
You got the right one?

656
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,560
- Maybe he was her boyfriend.
- Thanks.

657
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,320
- You did the right thing.
Really, you did.
- Good work, pal.

658
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,240
You got it.
M-I-G-N-O-N.

659
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,280
You got it?
There you go.

660
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,640
- Thank you so much, Sally.
You gotta love her.
- Where is he?

661
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,360
- Brooklyn.
- Okay, let's, uh--
let's grab a subway.

662
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,280
Wait a minute. Wait. Aren't you
forgetting about something?

663
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,200
- What?
- Wedding rehearsal.
Bachelor party.

664
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,120
- Plenty of time.
Plenty of time. Come on.
- You sure?

665
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,400
- Yes. Gotta go to Brooklyn.
Come on.

666
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,800
Prada!

667
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,720
Oh, my God!

668
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,920
Ooh! Prada!

669
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,760
Ooh, I love this stuff.

670
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,680
- That's $20.
- Twenty bucks?

671
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,080
Eve, that's
a horrific knockoff.

672
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,160
At least my fake says "Prada."
Yours says "Prado."

673
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,680
Yeah? Well,
I say for a dollar,

674
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,600
I can buy a little
Magic Marker and fix that.

675
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,600
I'll take it.
Twenty bucks?

676
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,800
Right back here.
Here you go.

677
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,080
Two buckets of balls for the price
of one at the Chelsea Piers today.

678
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,000
- So where are we going to now?
- I don't know.

679
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,920
- Lady, lady, you're a golfer?
- I feel like I feel something.

680
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,480
- Two for the price of one.
- Right where I'm standing.
Hey! Who are you?

681
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,960
Can you believe that?
Two bucket of-- Whoa!

682
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,120
- Will you help me up, ma'am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.
- Oh, my God.

683
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,560
- Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?

684
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,920
- Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?
- Oh, my. Goodness gracious.

685
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,200
- I'm all right.
Can you get the flyers?
- Here you go.

686
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,600
- Taxi!
- Sara!

687
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,400
They should
make pills for this.

688
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,600
He's gotta be here.

689
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,520
He's got to be here.
I can feel it.

690
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,960
- Excuse me. Miss?
- Yeah?

691
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,560
- You're blocking my shot.
- Oh.

692
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,560
Oh. Sorry.

693
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,600
This is Nick Roberts,
ESPN News, New York City.

694
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,160
- Oh!
- Do you know
who plays golf?.

695
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,480
Guys who are too fat
to play tennis.

696
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,400
Like that guy.

697
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,320
Well, this is a special occasion.

698
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,000
After all, how many times in your
life is your son gonna get married?

699
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,920
Well said.

700
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,440
- You wanna know
why I love this game?
- No. Why?

701
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,400
I'll tell ya.

702
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,840
You can take years off from playing
and still come back strong.

703
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,720
Well, me, I haven't played
in over five years.

704
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,200
You're kidding.

705
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,680
- Ow!
- Ooh!

706
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
- Sorry up there.

707
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,720
- Eve, look out!
- Go.

708
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,360
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm, so sorr-- Are you okay?

709
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,400
Please say something.
Say something.

710
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,560
I think I swallowed a filling.

711
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,000
Thank you for letting us in.
Now, Mr. Mignon,

712
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,880
we have an odd and some what
personal question to ask you.

713
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,320
Mignon.

714
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,480
Mr. Mignon.

715
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,200
Mignon. Like the meat.

716
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,320
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago,
did you live with a girl,
first name Sara?

717
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,300
Attractive, dark hair,
kind of, like, mysterious,
you know, really amazing girl.

718
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,508
Oui.

719
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:49,955
- Do you know where we can
locate this individual?
- No, I do not.

720
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,320
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.

721
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh, come on. You don't
even remember the last name
of your ex-girlfriend?

722
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,160
- I find that hard to believe.
- You don't understand anything.

723
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,480
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.

724
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,440
She stayed with me
for a very short period of time.

725
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,280
- She was placed with me by--
- A roommate finder's service?

726
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,880
Oui. She stayed with me with
her boyfriend for a few months--

727
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,000
- I don't care about him.
- And then he moved out
very quickly.

728
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,400
And at the end of the year,
she moved out too.

729
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah, but did she
leave anything behind,

730
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,000
maybe with her last name on it,
like a receipt, a bill?

731
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,080
- Like a piece of luggage?
- No. No, no.

732
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,080
Anything would help,
really. Anything.

733
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,320
I remember she sat on me.

734
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,880
She-- She sat on you?

735
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,720
Yes. She sat on me
for a while.

736
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,440
I found her...

737
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,960
inspiring.

738
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,000
I guess that is why I started
painting her in the first place.

739
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,920
Oh. She sat for you.
I'm sorry.

740
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,600
That is what I said.

741
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,040
- That's what he said.
- That's what I said.

742
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,040
Clearly.

743
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,400
Do you happen
to have the painting?

744
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,360
Hey, now you're gonna see
what it's all about.
You know, you see her face.

745
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,840
Okay. Yeah.

746
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,360
This is her, yes?

747
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,760
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.

748
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,120
I mean, I'm definitely getting
the British thing, you know,
with the crown and the scepter.

749
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,360
- Do you have a name for
the roommate finder's service?
- They would have the information.

750
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,880
No, I do not.

751
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,440
But if it helps, I do remember
where the service was located.

752
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,360
- Absolutely!
- Yes! Where? Where?

753
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,720
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?

754
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,680
On 60thStreet.

755
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,920
- East side or west side?
- It was just next to that--

756
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,280
on the left of that
splendid little patisserie,

757
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,720
Serendipity.

758
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,640
Thats it.

759
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,640
Get-- Get ready.

760
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,800
Happy birthday.
It's on the house.

761
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,760
Thank you.

762
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,640
Thanks.

763
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,080
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.

764
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,880
No, you will be if you sing.

765
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,440
Eve, thanks so much
for coming with me.

766
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,360
You're welcome.

767
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,000
Sara, you know,
it's a wonderful thought.

768
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,080
The idea that all of life,
that every single event
is part of some master plan...

769
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,000
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate.

770
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,880
But if that's really true,
then what's the point of living?

771
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,720
Or making decisions?
Hell, why should we even
get out of bed in the morning?

772
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,520
For the cake?

773
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,360
No. Not for cake.

774
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,960
So that you make mistakes.

775
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,360
Mistakes like this trip.

776
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,320
And if you're smart enough,
you learn from your mistakes.

777
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,600
You figure it out.
You-You think.

778
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,040
You realize that life
isn't some elaborate stage play
with directions for the actors.

779
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,000
Life's a mess, Sara.

780
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,000
It's-It's
chaos personified.

781
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,040
I have to give it
all up now, don't I?

782
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,960
Sara, you have a fiancé who,

783
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,800
despite his weird
Eastern music,

784
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,760
which we hope is
just a phase, let's hope,

785
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,680
loves you
very, very, very much.

786
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,880
It's not giving up.
It's growing up.

787
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,240
Let's get out of here.

788
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,080
Yeah.

789
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,000
- Here's one.
- Ooh, catch it.

790
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,280
- It's a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God. The irony.

791
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,560
- Wait right here.
I'll be right back. Stay here.
- Why?

792
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,520
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7:30.

793
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,440
Right. Right.

794
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,360
They moved downtown. If we get lucky
with traffic, we can still hit it.

795
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,280
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can't do it.

796
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,200
- Taxi!
- It's over, man.

797
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,560
What?

798
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,120
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?
"Bless the goddamn bride"?

799
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,400
- What?
- It can't get
any more clearer than this.

800
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,800
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's not in the cards.

801
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,160
Hey, it's another
one of your clues, man.
Let's talk about it in the cab...

802
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,600
- on the way over.
- It's not a clue. It's a sign.

803
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,680
- What's the difference?
- A clue is what a detective
uses to find a suspect.

804
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,000
The receipt, the warehouse,
that French guy-- those
are clues. This is a sign.

805
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,920
Me never finding the book,
that's a sign.

806
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,120
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill,
that's a sign.

807
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,640
How could something
not happening be a sign?

808
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,600
Maybe the absence
of signs is a sign.

809
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,040
Isn't it?

810
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,120
That's lucid.

811
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,360
Look, I don't know, man.
Maybe there is no fate.

812
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,520
And if there is,
it's not working for me.

813
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,400
You know, it's not actually supposed
to end this way, by the way.

814
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,120
We're supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard, all right?

815
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,840
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.
My wedding rehearsal...

816
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,760
starts in less
than an hour.

817
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,840
- My bride is waiting for me.
- Let me ask you something here.

818
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,680
If Sara were here right now,
poof, came down, what would
she tell you to do?

819
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,920
She would tell me to run,
not walk to the Waldorf...

820
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,160
because all the signs
point to me getting married.

821
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,080
Look. Wedding dress.
Lots of white.

822
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,560
- I hate to state the obvious--
- State it.

823
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,200
If you don't do this,
you may never find out who Sara is.

824
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,840
Maybe I was never
supposed to.

825
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,760
Maybe all this
is just a maze...

826
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,480
designed to lead me directly
back to where I started.

827
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,120
Which is getting married.

828
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,720
They should make pills
for this.

829
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,320
- Halley?
- Oh, my God. Eve!

830
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,680
What a crazy coincidence!
How are you?

831
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,680
- Good.
- Oh, my God.
Sara, can you believe...

832
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,720
that I was Halley's R.A.
in college?

833
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,640
Isn't that funny?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Sara.

834
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,720
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

835
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,600
Oh, my gosh. What's it been,
like eight or nine years?

836
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,560
Eve was, uh--
I went to B.U. with Eve.

837
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,640
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah. How about that?

838
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,760
So what are you doing here?

839
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,920
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- You are? Congratulations.

840
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,480
- Congratulations.
- Wow!

841
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,520
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?

842
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,800
Yeah, at noon.
We're going to rehearsal.
Why don't you come watch?

843
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,280
- Why don't you go?
- Okay, sure. I would love
to come and watch.

844
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,800
And you can bring your...
partner if you want.

845
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,840
- Oh!
- Oh! No, no.

846
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,640
I have to go upstairs
and call my fiancé-- who's a man.

847
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,560
Oh! You must be
very proud.

848
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,440
- Okay, so have a good one.
I'll see you later.
- Okay, good.

849
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,320
Good-bye,
my sweet lesbian lady lover.

850
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,200
I'm just kidding.
It's just a joke between us.

851
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,600
Lars?

852
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,880
What are you doing?

853
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,560
- How did you know where I was?
- Intuition.

854
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,280
Really?

855
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,960
No. I went through
the New York Hotel Guide.

856
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,280
Alphabetically, in reverse.
I started with "Z."

857
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,680
Sara, I missed you so much.

858
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,400
I'm sorry. I don't blame you
for running away.

859
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,440
I was so... focused
on the album, the video.

860
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,480
I, Jonathan, take you, Halley,
to be my wife,

861
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,400
and I promise to love
and sustain you...

862
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,320
in the bond of marriage
from this day forward.

863
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,160
And obviously, Jonathan,
you'll be looking at Halley.

864
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,000
- And that's when the actual
ceremony will conclude.

865
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,440
- Excuse me. I need
some help over here.
- What?

866
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,520
And then--
then you're married.

867
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,440
Hal, who's that girl
over there?

868
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,720
- Oh, that's my old friend Eve.
- Oh.

869
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,680
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap.

870
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,120
And now make sure to
be here tomorrow morning
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.

871
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,000
I hate to break up a good thing,
but we have some strippers
waiting for us. We're late.

872
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,360
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no. I mean "strippers."

873
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,640
- The women who take off everything.
- I'll see you men at 9:00.

874
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,560
But remember, I promised Judy
I'd be home by 10:00.

875
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,680
Fantastic. It gives you
an hour to get crazy.

876
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,880
Let's get into it.

877
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,200
Before you take Jon and Dad off
to your male-bonding ritual,
I need to talk to him.

878
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,080
Okay. Beautiful bride.
I'll be in the cab.

879
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,000
- Hi.
- I want you to meet Jon.

880
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,400
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- I would love
for you to come tomorrow.

881
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,920
- We'd feel terrible if you didn't.
- Really?

882
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,520
- Yeah.
- That's so sweet.
It's tomorrow at noon?

883
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,480
Yeah, and you can bring
your friend if you want.

884
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,240
- Okay. I'll be there.
- Be there.

885
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,160
Thank you.
That's so nice.

886
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,480
- See you tomorrow.
- Nice to meet you. Bye. See you.

887
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,600
- Halley, what is it?
What's wrong?
- It's you.

888
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,160
- What do you mean, it's me?
What did I do?
- Nothing, exactly.

889
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,280
It's just this feeling
I have, like--

890
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,240
like you've been somewhere else
for the past few days.

891
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,400
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Jonathan.

892
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,280
I've dreamed about this
my entire life, and-and...

893
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,800
I've imagined the dress
and the flowers...

894
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,640
and even the music
the band was gonna play.

895
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,000
And everything is exactly the way
I want it, except for my fiancé,

896
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,280
who's just decided to float off
to Never-Never Land.

897
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,360
Look, maybe I've been a little bit
out of it the past week,

898
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,600
but it's just normal,
you know, guy stuff.

899
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,880
- It's a little cold feet.
Doesn't mean I don't love you.
- Well, call me crazy,

900
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,920
but I'd like
my fiancés feet to be warm,

901
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,320
especially when we're hours
from going down the aisle.

902
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,520
I'm sorry, Hal.
Really, I am.

903
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,840
Whatever it is that
you're holding on to,

904
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,720
please just let it go.

905
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,960
Please.

906
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,920
I think it already
let go of me, okay?

907
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,680
Wait.

908
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,080
- What's this?
- What do you think?

909
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,920
It's the traditional
groom's gift.

910
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,040
- I got yours,
and I forgot to bring it.
- I know. It's okay.

911
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,320
Open it.

912
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,200
It's a first edition.

913
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,840
It's just that every time
we go into a bookstore,
you're always flipping through it.

914
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,680
And I checked this week.
You don't even have a copy.

915
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,320
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?

916
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,360
It's perfect.

917
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,520
It's an excellent choice.

918
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,440
What's going on?
Are you all right?

919
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,800
Her name's Sara Thomas.

920
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,720
What?

921
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,640
How did--

922
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,560
Halley gave it to me
as a wedding gift.

923
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,280
Sally?

924
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,800
It's Dean from obits.
Hey.

925
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,880
I need an address for a Sara Thomas.
S-A-R-A T-H-O-M-A-S.

926
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,360
Uh, I got
an old phone number.

927
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,320
Yeah, we'll hold.

928
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,840
Hang on.
Sir, can you pull this thing over?

929
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,400
I can't hear a thing.

930
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,120
Honey, just one second.
Okay, go. What?

931
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,320
What?

932
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,640
We have to cancel
Dusseldorf. Why?

933
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,800
We have to cancel Stockholm?

934
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,040
Oh. Look at those stars.

935
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,320
They all have names,
you know.

936
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,600
I don't know
what that is.

937
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,880
It's Cassiopeia.

938
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,600
The... stars in the sky.

939
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,840
It's Cassiopeia.

940
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,840
You realize with the time delay,
if our return flight takes off
more than ten minutes late,

941
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,760
I miss my own wedding, okay?

942
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,480
- Does that bother you
in the slightest?
- You are a jackass.

943
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,600
- Well, thank you.
- You are. You--

944
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,560
Y-Y-You're my hero,
you know?

945
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,200
You're like my oracle
and shit, you know?

946
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,360
You're out there, man,
and you're making it happen.

947
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,600
Courtney moved out.

948
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,280
- What?
- Yeah. It's-- Look, man.

949
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,360
We'd been fighting
for a really long time.

950
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,280
Why didn't you tell me?

951
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,200
We didn't want to ruin
your wedding, man.

952
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,480
- Didn't want to rain
on your parade, man.
- What the hell happened?

953
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,400
We just--

954
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,360
We let it slip away,
you know?

955
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,560
That's the point. It--
You know, it died.

956
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,360
- We died.
- What was the cause of death?

957
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,800
Not enough of all of this,
of this, of this.

958
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,480
And not enough,
you know? Do you--

959
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,160
Do you remember
the philosopher Epictetus?
You remember what he said?

960
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,800
He said, "If you want to
improve, be content to be
thought foolish and stupid."

961
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,000
That's what you've done.

962
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,640
- I work hard at it.
- Now I want to be a jackass.

963
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,640
You know?
You're the shit!

964
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,080
That would be me, the shit.

965
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,880
Yeah. He's the shit. Okay.

966
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,440
You know what, old buddy?
On second thought,
maybe you should call first.

967
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,360
- What are you talking about?
- Give her a ring.
It's more polite that way.

968
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,280
Calling her gives her
a chance to clean up.

969
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,200
I don't care how clean
her house is!

970
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,120
- She might.
- What are you talking about?

971
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,960
- You told me to go!
You said I was your hero!
- I forbid you to look.

972
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,880
- You can't look!
- Why are you hanging on?

973
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,800
- I don't want you to get hurt.
Don't get hurt!
- You're hurting me!

974
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:29,040
I think that went very well.

975
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,280
Didn't-- Didn't she say that
everything happens for a reason?

976
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,400
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, maybe we're
laying here because--

977
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,040
Because why?

978
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,720
Because you don't want to
be standing somewhere else.

979
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,840
I see. Yeah.
We're crawling. We're crawling.

980
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

981
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,760
I'm sorry to report that we're gonna
be on the ground a little longer...

982
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,720
due to some bad weather
heading this way.

983
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,680
The air traffic controller
has put us on hold,

984
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,120
so in the mean time,
I've asked the cabin attendants
to start the movie.

985
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,880
- Hey, you getting ready?
- Yeah.

986
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,480
You know me.
I love a good wedding.

987
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,120
- So have you talked to Lars?
- Yeah.

988
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,960
We spoke this morning
before he left.

989
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,080
I think he's gonna be okay.
At least I hope so.

990
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,960
Of course he's gonna be okay,
and you're gonna be okay too.

991
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,360
Yeah?

992
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,240
Oh, you know what?
There's a lady glaring at me.

993
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:35,600
I don't think I'm supposed
to be on the phone.
Can I call you when I get home?

994
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,520
Have a safe flight, okay?

995
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,560
- Lots of love. Bye.
- Headsets?

996
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,400
- Yes, I will.
- $3.00, please.

997
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,640
What the hell is this?

998
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,360
Something the matter?

999
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,960
Yes. I think I've mixed up
my wallet with my friend's.

1000
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,880
Yes, I have.
See? Prado.

1001
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,280
Oh. Well, is there
any money in it?

1002
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,920
I'll have a look.

1003
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,760
Yes, there is.
Thank you.

1004
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:24,720
Two ones... and a five.

1005
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,640
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

1006
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,320
- Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
- That's this gentleman's change.

1007
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,720
- Jonathan. Jonathan.
- Excuse me. I just--

1008
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,080
Sorry. You know what?
I'm going to--

1009
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,320
Thank you. Excuse me.
Sorry. Whoo! I'm sorry!

1010
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,800
Hi. Yeah.
It's in New York City.

1011
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,160
I need the address
of a Jonathan Trager.

1012
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,160
Yeah. T-R-A-G-E-R.

1013
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,800
34 Charles Street?
Thank you.

1014
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,720
34 Charles Street.

1015
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,560
Hi. I'm looking
for a Jonathan Trager.
Is this his building?

1016
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,080
- You must be late.
- Late for what?

1017
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,240
The wedding.
Waldorf-Astoria.

1018
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,000
- He's getting married?
- Might be already.

1019
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,960
- Wait! Hey, wait! Wait!
Excuse me!

1020
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,600
Sorry. Can you take me
to the Waldorf-Astoria
as fast as you can go, please?

1021
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,000
Can you see what it is?

1022
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,240
Oh! Sorry. Sorry!

1023
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,000
Oh. Oh, please, God, no.

1024
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,480
- Stop!
- Stop?

1025
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,400
Is it over?

1026
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,160
- The wedding?
- Yeah.

1027
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,000
Oh, yeah.
It's over, all right.

1028
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,440
But dont worry.

1029
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,960
You'll get
your present back.

1030
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,600
- Excuse me?
- They always return the presents.

1031
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,720
You asked
if it was over.

1032
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,200
The truth is,
it never even began.

1033
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,920
- What?
- Yeah. He called the whole
thing off this morning.

1034
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,040
He called it off?

1035
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,440
That's terrible.

1036
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,440
Were you a friend
of the bride?

1037
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,160
Or the groom?

1038
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,560
- What's up with this weather?
- What happened to spring?

1039
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,000
- So, what kind of
pep talk do you want?
- What do you got?

1040
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,760
Well, I've got the inspirational
"You can achieve anything
you dream about."

1041
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,760
It's very popular,
but not appropriate for this.

1042
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,360
Of course, there's the "Don't worry,
there's more fish in the sea" pap.

1043
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,600
- No.
- Uh, we can always
fall back on the classic...

1044
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:41,840
"When God shuts a door,
he opens a window."

1045
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,000
How about telling me
I did the right thing?

1046
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,200
I don't have to tell you.

1047
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,200
I wrote it.

1048
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,200
- What's this?
- It's your obituary.

1049
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,040
- Nice.
- Turns out I had writer's block...

1050
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,840
penning your best man speech,
and that's what ended up coming out.

1051
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,560
Blame it on the day job.

1052
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,040
- Twenty, right?
- Thanks.

1053
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,320
- You going to see Courtney?
- Absolutely.

1054
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,320
I needed this.

1055
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,640
You know, the Greeks
didn't write obituaries.

1056
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,880
They only asked one question
after a man died:

1057
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,040
"Did he have passion?"

1058
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,440
How do I look?

1059
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,800
Like a jackass.

1060
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,520
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

1061
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,280
Jonathan Trager,

1062
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,960
prominent television producer
for ESPN,

1063
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,040
died last night from
complications of losing
his soul mate and his fiancé.

1064
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:09,200
He was 35 years old
and soft-spoken and obsessive.

1065
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,240
Trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic.

1066
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,440
But in the final days
of his life,

1067
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,280
he revealed
an unknown side of his psyche.

1068
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,440
This hidden
quasi-Jungian persona...

1069
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,520
surfaced during
the Agatha Christie-like pursuit
for his long-reputed soul mate,

1070
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,320
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with.

1071
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,400
Sadly, the protracted search
ended late Saturday night...

1072
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,200
in complete and utter failure.

1073
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,440
Yet even in certain defeat,

1074
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,880
the courageous Trager
secretly clung to the belief...

1075
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,640
that life is not merely
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences.

1076
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,280
Uh-uh. But rather
it's a tapestry of events...

1077
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,880
that culminate in
an exquisite, sublime plan.

1078
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,200
Asked about the loss
of his dear friend, Dean Kansky,

1079
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,680
the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author and executive editor
of the New York Times,

1080
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,840
described Jonathan as a changed man
in the last days of his life.

1081
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,880
"Things were clearer for him,"
Kansky noted.

1082
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,360
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded
that if we are to live life
in harmony with the universe,

1083
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,760
we must all possess a powerful
faith in what the ancients
used to call "fatum,"

1084
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,440
- what we currently
refer to as destiny.
- Destiny.

1085
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,280
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1086
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,320
I guess I'm just gonna
try and find him or something.

1087
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,520
I don't think you should do that.
I really don't.

1088
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,760
- Well, what do you think
I should do?
- Just be here.

1089
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,440
- I feel it.
I feel it in the air.
- Eve, what's happened to you?

1090
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,800
You've become your own
worst nightmare right there.

1091
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,400
Bye.

1092
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,880
And please put a jacket on.
It's freezing out here.

1093
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,320
I'm Jon.

1094
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,440
I'm Sara.

1095
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,840
- Happy anniversary.
- When did you get to be
so unabashedly romantic?

1096
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,400
I think it's good luck we return
each year to the scene of the crime.

1097
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1098
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,120
Oh, I don't think so!
No beverages on the premises!

1099
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,520
- I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.
- Hey, how you doing?

1100
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,200
- Don't you remember me?
This is the girl.
- Yes, I do.

1101
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,560
- Miss Carbon Copy? I see.
- Yes.

1102
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,760
- This is the guy who helped me--
- If you're not gonna
purchase anything,

1103
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,600
please make room
for paying customers.

1104
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,000
- We do. We want some gloves.
Black cashmere gloves.

1105
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,160
Oh, I'm sorry.
That'll be the closing bell.

1106
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,400
Perhaps tomorrow.
Store hours 10:00 to 7:00,
except Sundays and holidays...

1107
01:21:52,435 --> 01:21:54,560
Perhaps tomorrow.
Store hours 10:00 to 7:00,
except Sundays and holidays...

1108
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,920
- He warms up.
- at the discretion
of the management...

1109
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,360
or the possible exception
of visiting dignitaries.

1110
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,800
Oh, no, no, no! Please!
On the other side of the counter.

1111
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,920
You cannot come back here. This is
for authorized personnel only.

1112
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,920
Please remain on
the other side of the counter.

1113
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,880
Thank you very much.
