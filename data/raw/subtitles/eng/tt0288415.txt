1
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:55,429
Do you want pimento loaf
or baloney?

2
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:16,113
Hey, Professor!
They only got a couple of spots left!

3
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,123
Shh.

4
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,159
Ours is right over there.

5
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,262
- [Laughing]
- Carlton.

6
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,976
You see, if our experiment
is a success...

7
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:41,810
we will have isolated
the super sports gene.

8
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:46,615
And then we can sell it to professional
athletes all around the world.

9
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:48,620
- Amazing.
- Oh, yes, it is.

10
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,089
But it can only be done if we have all
of Air Bud's puppies as well as the...

11
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,890
- Bud.
- Now, you must memorize these faces.

12
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,691
We have to catch each
and every one.

13
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:01,666
This is Buddy's oldest pup, Shooter.
And this one, Duke.

14
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:05,933
Here's Buddy's third pup, Zack,
an outstanding linebacker.

15
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,474
- Backer.
- And a puppy who already knows...

16
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,703
how to play soccer... Striker.

17
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,337
- Striker.
- And, of course, the best of them all...

18
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:15,176
their father.

19
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:19,184
- The Bud.
- Then, and only then,
will I have the ingredients...

20
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:23,313
to create the greatest experiment ever.
[Laughing]

21
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,307
Hey, Buddy,
check this out!

22
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:47,210
All right, Duke!
Nice catch!

23
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,679
Yeah! What? What?

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,843
- Nice play.
- You better recognize.

25
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,888
Defense, defense!

26
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,757
Shooter, to you!

27
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,429
Yeah, Shooter!
Yes!

28
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,670
Hut!

29
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,173
Zack, go deep!

30
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,310
Yes!

31
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:28,714
- Way to go, Striker!
- [Barking]

32
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,120
Hey, Buddy, come on.

33
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,267
Buddy, shoot!

34
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:45,634
[Laughing]

35
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,902
- Honey, flames!
- It's fine, it's fine!

36
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,369
See?

37
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:58,079
- You're killing me here!
- [Giggling]

38
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,609
Hey, Josh, put me down!
[Laughing]

39
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,590
[Girl]
Shoot!

40
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:14,331
Mama mia!

41
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,598
- You gonna have some of that?
- So?

42
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:21,767
- Honey, can you get Andrea?
- Yeah, sure. Andrea, lunch!

43
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:23,741
I could've done that.

44
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,904
Will you and Buddy
still baby-sit?

45
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,349
- It depends on how busy we are.
- We might have a lot of homework.

46
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,511
You're gonna be
in high school?

47
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:35,646
Junior high.

48
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,350
Yeah.
Junior high, here we come.

49
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:41,826
- [Mother] Andrea!
- I gotta go.

50
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:51,937
I don't think we should be doing this
anymore. It's kind of elementary.

51
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:55,668
Yeah, you're probably right.
Well, see ya later.

52
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,676
See ya.

53
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:01,805
- Want some juice?
- You want some of that too?

54
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:05,146
- Guess what. Tom and I are
in two of the same classes.
- Oh, great!

55
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,652
- Don't let him distract you.
- Don't worry.

56
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,349
Why don't you go see
your brother?

57
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:14,223
Tammy and I are in four
of the same classes.

58
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:16,626
I think we have that same history
teacher you guys used to make fun of.

59
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:19,290
Buzzoo!
Who wants a busy bee?

60
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,130
- The one you said looked like a gopher.
- Pass me one of those ribs.

61
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,034
Who wants a busy bee?
Who wants a busy bee?

62
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,979
Leftovers!

63
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,845
[Barking]

64
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,079
Okay.
[Yelling]

65
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,599
Need any help?

66
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,830
Nope. Pretty much
all packed up.

67
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,871
- Think you're gonna miss it here?
- Yeah, sure.

68
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,602
But, you know, it doesn't mean
I'm gone forever, right?

69
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:08,011
So, are you gonna come
and visit?

70
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,379
Yeah, I think I might sneak back
for a day in the summer.

71
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:16,445
I'm just kidding.
I'll be back at Thanksgiving.

72
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:20,516
I was thinking maybe you could
take my room while I'm gone,
make sure nobody messes it up.

73
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,888
But it's your room.

74
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,400
So, you could
borrow it, right?

75
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,871
Nah, I'd rather have
it stay just the way it is.

76
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,912
Good night, Josh.

77
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,558
'Night, Andrea.

78
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:06,570
I'm really going to miss you.

79
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,214
- Sure you got everything?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,883
I got it.

81
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:27,358
There.
Let's go, Buddy.

82
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:32,825
Okay then, I guess it's time.
Where's Andrea?

83
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,027
I don't know.
She was here a minute ago.

84
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:38,468
- Why don't I go find her?
- I'll get Noah ready.

85
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,972
Where's your sister?

86
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:45,337
Andrea!

87
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,950
Andrea?

88
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,291
[Mother]
Andrea! We've gotta go!

89
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:12,065
Andrea!

90
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:16,006
If we don't leave now,
we're gonna miss the bus.

91
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,134
- Let's go.
- Hey.

92
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:22,079
Buddy, can you find Andrea
for me?

93
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,343
Go find her.

94
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:13,762
[Barking]

95
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,768
Buddy, stop!

96
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,770
Leave me alone.

97
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,709
[Barking]

98
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,915
Buddy,
where are we going?

99
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:43,095
Hey, it's Josh.

100
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:47,799
Josh! How's it goin'?

101
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,467
Ahh, good to see ya.

102
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:56,508
- Tom, you look ready.
- I've been ready all summer.

103
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,510
[Chuckling]

104
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,069
Josh, they're boarding.
I'll go say good-bye to my folks...

105
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,274
and then I'll grab us
some front-row seats.

106
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:06,512
- All right. We'll see ya.
I'll be there in a minute.
- I'll put these on the bus.

107
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:12,320
All right, son.
Go where you must go. Oh, baby!

108
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,097
[Sobbing]
Oh, oh, give me one more.

109
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:21,292
- Guess it's time.
- Yeah.

110
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:25,871
Guess you're gonna have to say bye
to Andrea and Buddy for me.

111
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,635
I will. I will.

112
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,279
Don't worry, Mom, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

113
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:38,806
I know you will.

114
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,788
I love you.

115
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:47,189
I love you too.
Oh, bye.

116
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,629
Okay.

117
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,045
Bye.

118
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:24,096
- Want a sandwich?
- No. Thank you.

119
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,438
There he is.

120
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:39,008
[Humming]

121
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:45,944
[Barking]

122
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:08,102
- That's it, Buddy! That's his bus!
- [Barking]

123
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:35,098
[Barks]

124
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,402
Buddy!

125
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,275
- Buddy?
- [Barks]

126
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,107
- Josh!
- Andrea?

127
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,511
What's wrong?

128
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,075
Nothing. I mean...

129
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:58,621
I didn't get
to say good-bye.

130
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,087
I don't want you to go,
Josh.

131
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,089
I know, Andrea,
but listen to me, okay?

132
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,657
It's just time.

133
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:12,431
All right? Just like it's time
for you to go to junior high.

134
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,871
Yeah, I know.

135
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:18,570
Are you gonna come out
and visit me?

136
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,109
Okay.

137
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:25,707
Here, I, uh...

138
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:28,310
I want you to have this.

139
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,885
That's Dad's watch!

140
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,325
I know, but...

141
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,693
you just keep it for me
till I get back.

142
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,467
Hey.

143
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:47,302
- I'll miss you, okay?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:51,639
You and Buddy
can look after each other.

145
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,242
You look after Andrea for me,
okay?

146
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,585
[Sighs]
See ya, Bud.

147
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:21,439
Okay. Now I really do
have to go, so here.

148
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:26,501
- I love you.
- I love you too, Josh.

149
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:31,510
[Bus Driver]
That's it, folks.

150
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,745
Get back
to your seats, please.

151
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:39,222
[Sighs]
I love that dog.

152
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,453
Come on, Buddy.

153
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,155
[Chuckling]

154
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,487
You little...

155
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:21,090
Will you stop fooling around?
I thought I told you to go buy us a car.

156
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,763
What are you looking at?

157
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,746
Sweet!

158
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,183
[Gasps]

159
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:46,119
Ta-da!

160
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,319
Carlton!

161
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,098
You don't like it?

162
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,476
[Barking]

163
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,209
Okay, okay, I'm up! I'm up!
[Giggles]

164
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:24,856
Mom, how's this?

165
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,024
Honey, that looks great.
Do you want some toast?

166
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:42,808
- How 'bout this one?
- Honey, that looks good too.
Don't forget your lunch.

167
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:46,010
Thanks.

168
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,821
I'm so nervous.

169
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,918
- Need a ride?
- Oh, no. Tammy and I
are gonna walk together.

170
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,429
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Oh, that's her. Gotta go.

171
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,692
Did you change?

172
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:06,067
[Father]
It looks nice!

173
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,629
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,439
Well, here goes.

175
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,877
[Tammy]

348
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:52,316
Hey, you guys!

349
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:55,046
Anybody home?

350
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,054
Hello?

351
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,524
- I made the base...
- Shh! He's asleep.

352
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,622
[Crying]

353
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:13,126
[Andrea]
Sorry.

354
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:16,002
I made the team.

355
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:19,402
Come on, Buddy.

356
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:27,376
Wait.

357
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,512
Watch it!
Watch Shooter!

358
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,920
Are you all ready?

359
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:39,259
Let him loose.

360
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:50,605
There you go, Rocky.

361
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:57,413
[Barks]

362
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:01,210
Come on, Rocky!

363
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,220
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes.

364
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,057
[Chuckling]

365
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,021
Huh?

366
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,503
Go.

367
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:29,476
Ball, ball, ball!

368
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:32,209
Hold up, man.
Where's Shooter?

369
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:34,217
I don't know.

370
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:36,753
He took a doggie time-out
or something.

371
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,381
Shooter!

372
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:43,086
Just remember, we are not the bad guys.
We are the scientists.

373
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:46,892
- We are... good guys.
- Good. Science is good.

374
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:49,263
- [Barking]
- Science is good, yes.

375
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:52,633
- Shooter?
- C'mon, boy, where are ya?

376
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:54,638
Shooter!

377
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:01,667
Wait tillJosh finds out.
He won't believe it.

378
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:05,807
- Hey!
- Hello, Andrea. How are you doing?

379
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,079
Great!

380
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:12,146
I made the...

381
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:14,248
Whoops!

382
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:19,489
- Baseball team.
- See you at the ballpark.

383
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,800
Sheriff? Sheriff.

384
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:36,537
Hmm? What's up?

385
00:35:36,614 --> 00:35:39,481
I'm sorry to interrupt, Sheriff,
but my Shooter's gone missing.

386
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:41,985
You got a permit
for that gun, son?

387
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,385
N-No. My Shooter.

388
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,220
- Your rifle?
- No, my dog.

389
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,852
Your dog.
What's his name?

390
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,691
Shooter!

391
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:58,699
O'er the land
of the free

392
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,366
And the home of the

393
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:07,844
[Sour Note]
Brave

394
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:11,609
Good afternoon, Fernfield.
This is Mailman Phil...

395
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:15,050
broadcasting live on
Fernfield community radio...

396
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,953
bringing you the Timberwolves'
first game of the season.

397
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:22,186
Okay, you guys, you all know your
positions. So let's get out there...

398
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,251
and show them
a little Timberwolf teeth!

399
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,423
A little Timberwolf teeth!
Come on, you guys!

400
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:30,593
[Together]
One, two, three... Timberwolves!

401
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,230
Come on, guys!

402
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:39,436
Here we go.
[Humming: "Take Me Out
To The Ball Game"]

403
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:41,445
Next leg.

404
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:44,846
Before we start the game, I'd like to
remind everyone that Shooter is missing.

405
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:48,283
And all the basketball players would
appreciate it, that if you see him...

406
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:50,514
to please give them a holler.

407
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:54,891
Play ball!

408
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:57,792
Come on, guys, we can do it!
I'm right behind you all!

409
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,386
Whoo!

410
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,930
Got it.

411
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:10,971
- [Cheering]
- Yeah!

412
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:13,010
Awesome catch, Tammy!
Awesome catch!

413
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,885
Come on, Tammy!

414
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:32,458
Yeah! Yes!

415
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,967
Safe!

416
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,600
I gotta tell ya, folks,
Tammy is solidifying herself...

417
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:48,009
as Fernfield's best player
as she leads...

418
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,809
the Timberwolves
to another victory!

419
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,282
I should've got
an automatic.

420
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,858
Strike three!
You're outta here!

421
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,701
Yes! Yoo-hoo!

422
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,875
Hi, Buddy.

423
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:32,819
Got it!

424
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,522
Here you go.

425
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:46,867
Shooter's missing?
Buddy?

426
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:02,349
We got a real
nail-biter here, folks.

427
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,412
We're in the bottom of the ninth.
Tammy's up to bat.

428
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,891
She's the best hitter.
Here she goes.

429
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:14,258
There's a long drive
out to right center field.

430
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,391
It's back. Back.

431
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,697
It's gone!
It's a home run!

432
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,864
- Ah-ooga!
- [Cheering]

433
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:25,431
Tammy has won the game
for the Timberwolves.

434
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,037
And another great victory
for Fernfield.

435
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,922
Andrea!

436
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,482
Andrea, wait up!

437
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:49,361
If you practice enough,
I know Coach will give you a chance.

438
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:53,165
Tammy, I don't even belong
on this team.

439
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:56,798
Coach made a mistake even letting me
join in the first place.

440
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,970
- Andrea?
- I gotta go.

441
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:09,116
We've got another exciting game
on our hands, folks.

442
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:13,419
It's the bottom of the ninth and
our feisty Timberwolves are tied up...

443
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:16,153
with the defending champion
Baboons at three runs apiece.

444
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:21,059
- Strike two!
- [Barks]

445
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,507
No.

446
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:43,179
[Groans]

447
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:44,778
Tammy!

448
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:48,519
- Tammy took that right off the elbow.
- Oh, no.

449
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,820
Oh.

450
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,794
- Oh, no, not Tammy!
- Okay, guys, get back.

451
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,600
- Ow.
- Oh, that's a doozy.

452
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:08,338
I can't move it.

453
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:11,939
You'll have to get it x-rayed.
Come on, honey.

454
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:17,810
Mike, get the gear on.
Andrea, go take right field.

455
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:22,326
This is bad news, folks.
It doesn't look like Tammy's
gonna be able to continue.

456
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:25,123
She's gonna have
to leave the game.

457
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:28,723
It's all right.
Tammy's in good hands.

458
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:37,666
Andrea Framm is gonna see
her first action of the season.

459
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:39,642
[Man]
Do it, Andrea.

460
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,736
Good teamwork, guys.

461
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:45,544
Strike one!

462
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:49,343
Strike two!

463
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,900
Got it!

464
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:14,035
No, no! Andrea!

465
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:16,341
Andrea, no!

466
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,446
[Crowd Groans]

467
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:29,918
Safe!

468
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:34,925
That's the game!
That's the game.

469
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,430
Sorry.

470
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:44,133
"Sorry"?
That just cost us the game.

471
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,445
Way to go.

472
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,978
We're gonna make her feel so
good when she comes here, okay?

473
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,719
Hey, sweetie!

474
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:05,989
For your first game,
it sure was close.

475
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:09,089
We would've won
if it wasn't for me.

476
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:13,102
It was your first time playing.
You've gotta give yourself a chance.

477
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,365
Tell that to the team.

478
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:18,431
Well, maybe I could help you
practice a little.

479
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:21,000
Even you think I suck.

480
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,656
Hey, honey.
So, how did it go?

481
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:45,597
Ow.

482
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:55,140
[Singing]

483
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:58,147
Still no sign of Shooter,
huh?

484
00:43:58,215 --> 00:44:01,946
Don't worry about it. Because
tomorrow we're gonna have another look.

485
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:06,353
Holy Italian hairdo. I almost forgot
the special shampoo for Senora Fusilli.

486
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:10,155
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

487
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:14,727
Come on!
Come on, Rocky!

488
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:16,790

Striker! Now, where do you go, my boy?

493
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:41,056
- Good work, Carlton.
- Thank you.

494
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:44,390
- Good work, Professor.
- Shut up.

- Hey.
- Hey.

498
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,184
Is it broken?

499
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:11,585
No.
Just badly bruised.

500
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,749
Then I guess you won't
be able to play.

501
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:17,293
Or help you practice.

502
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:20,125
Yeah.

- [Buddy Whimpers]
- Tammy?

504

Dinner!

505
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:29,235
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

506
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:32,798
- I hope you feel better.
- Thanks.

507
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,709
Strike one!

508
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,456
Strike two!

509
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:51,791
Come on, Andrea!
Keep your eye on the ball!

510
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,991
Strike three!

511
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,833
- Good try, sweetie!
- Good swing.

512
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:20,785
Hey, Buddy. No sign
of Shooter yet, huh?

513
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,523
You be careful, okay?
Keep the faith, Buddy. We'll find him.

514
00:46:43,447 --> 00:46:46,314
She's got it!
She's got it!

515
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:59,028
Things are looking pretty bleak
for the Timberwolves.

516
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:02,031
They've lost the last
three games in a row...

517
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:06,331
and their star player,
Tammy, is still out with an injury.

Zack, where'd you go?

524
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:55,014
[Randy] You practically forced Coach
Crenshaw to put Andrea on the team.

525
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:58,953
- What was I supposed to do?
She's my best friend.
- I don't know.

526
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:02,288
It's not like I meant
for us to lose the season.

527
00:48:04,662 --> 00:48:06,960
Oh, no. I gotta go.

528
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:10,762
Andrea?
Andrea, wait up!

529
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:12,768
Andrea!

530
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:23,940
I wish Josh was here.
He'd know how to help me.

531
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:28,975
[Whimpers]

532
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:35,220
[Barks]

533
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:43,958
All right, Buddy.
I'll come.

534
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:50,663
Okay, Buddy, I'm ready.

535
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:03,077
# There's a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow #

536
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,917
#Ring a bell
What a great day #

537
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,924
#Home run #

538
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:10,586
Buddy, I got it!
I got it!

539
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:15,325
#I'm ready to play #

540
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:20,666
#At the crack of the bat
I'll be off runnin'
Slidin'into first base #

541
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:25,437
#I'm making them take the field
for this pennant race #

542
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:28,103
#I'm ready to say #

543
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:31,375
# Take me
I'm ready to play #

544
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:34,417
[Shrieks]
Buddy!

545
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:36,112
Buddy!

546
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:38,882
Buddy!

547
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:43,222
[Shrieking]
Buddy, turn it off!

548
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:52,294
You can do it, Buddy.
That's a good catch.

549
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:57,872
# There's a ball down
the middle of the plate now #

550
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:01,172
#Here's a chance
for a Golden Glove #

551
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:05,306
# Great catch
That's the way it oughta go #

552
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:08,146
#In this game I love #

553
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:11,984
#It's the bottom of the ninth
The bases are loaded #

554
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,990
# To the crowd
I tip my hat #

555
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:16,686
I didn't know
you could do that.

556
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,058
Here comes another one,
Buddy.

557
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:26,998
#Hey, team, hey, team
I'm ready to play #

558
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:29,335
#Let me grab a bat
Let me hit away #

559
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:32,671
#Hey, team, hey, team
won't you put me in the game #

560
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:37,874
#I'm ready to lead us on
all the way #

561
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:39,916
#Hey, team
I'm ready to play #

562
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:43,384
#Let me grab a bat
Let me hit away #

563
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:46,446
#Hey, team, hey, team
won't you put me in the game #

564
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:50,220
#I'm ready to lead us on
all the way #

565
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:53,687
Oh, my gosh, I did it!

566
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:56,562
- [Shrieks] Buddy!
- #And it's goin'goin: Goin: Gone #

567
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:59,625
# Goin: Goin: Goin: Gone #

568
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:03,298
# Goin'all the way
to the Hall of Fame ##

569
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:06,639
She's going for home!
Is she gonna make it?

570
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:13,038
[Laughing]

571
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:31,632
Sheriff, Sheriff! Sorry to disturb you,
but Duke... he's gone missing.

572
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:34,762
- Duke? Somebody I know?
- Yeah, my dog, Duke.

573
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:39,639
What? Those dad-gum dognappers
are at it again!

574
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:43,077
Well, we have got one out
at the top of the ninth.

575
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:47,447
The Timberwolves are clinging
to a one-run lead over the Tigers.

576
00:51:47,518 --> 00:51:49,645
Let's go,
Timberwolves!

577
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,587
[Father]
We got it. Come on.

578
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,954
Strike two!

579
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:59,826
Folks, I don't think Randy's got
much gas left in his old arm.

580
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:02,127
Strike 'im out, Randy!

581
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:08,533
Blitz two!
Play it to two!

582
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:13,867
- Safe!
- [Cheering]

583
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:16,936
- I think we might see
a pitching change here.
- Time.

584
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:19,482
Time!

585
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:24,218
Randy, you're done.

586
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:27,655
- What? The arm's fine!
- Gimme the ball.

587
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:31,990
I'm not risking your arm.

588
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:35,498
Now, we're down one player, so we're
gonna have to go with two fielders.

589
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:39,229
Excuse me. Coach?

590
00:52:39,303 --> 00:52:43,137
Coach, is it too late in the season
for a new player to join the team?

591
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:48,144
Well, no, but-but...
Who do you have in mind?

592
00:52:48,212 --> 00:52:49,873
[Whistles]

593
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:53,376
[Girl]
It's Buddy!

594
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:58,221
Well, I'll be.

595
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:01,848
It's Buddy!

596
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:03,984
Look, they're putting
Air Bud in!

597
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:07,229
Buddy?

598
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:09,891
When did that happen?

599
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:16,504
- This is certainly
a strange turn of events.
- You gotta be kidding me.

600
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:20,566
Andrea Framm is coming in to pitch and
Buddy's put on a Timberwolves outfit.

601
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:23,340
He's coming in
to play first base.

602
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:25,574
Ah, yeah!

603
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:31,447
- This game's going to the dogs.
- Yeah, Andrea!

604
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:35,185
She's gonna pitch?

605
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,451
[Barking]

606
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:45,233
Let's play ball!

607
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:49,765
- All right, Andrea!
- Let's go!

608
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:57,876
- My ball!
- Yeah!

609
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:00,109
- You're outta there!
- [Laughing]

610
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:03,311
- Good job!
- [Child] All right, Andrea!

611
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:06,754
- [Barking]
- [Child] You rule, Buddy!

612
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:16,792
- Strike one!
- [Crowd Cheers]

613
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:20,803
[Tammy]
Pitch it to him hard, Andrea!

614
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,805
Strike two!

615
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:26,632
No balls!
Two strikes!

616
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,508
[Child's Voice]
Oh, hello, hello. [Kissing Sounds]

617
00:54:37,054 --> 00:54:39,215
Yeah, Terrance!

618
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:42,452
- [Tammy] Yes!
- Go, go, go!

619
00:54:42,526 --> 00:54:45,984
- Way to go, boy!
- Yeah, Buddy!
- [Barking]

620
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:49,999
And that's the game!
The Timberwolves win four to three.

621
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:55,767
And Andrea Framm got the final two outs
to wrap things up pretty good.

622
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:07,140
- Outta there!
- [Barking]

623
00:55:11,188 --> 00:55:14,783
- Good shot!
- [Giggles]

624
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:21,628
The next batter for the Timberwolves
is Buddy Framm.

625
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:24,667
Go, Buddy! Whoo! Go, Buddy! Whoo!
Go, Buddy! Whoo!

626
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:29,829
Yeah, Buddy!

627
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:33,202
[Woman]
They know what you're doing.

628
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,540
- Safe!
- [Laughing, Cheering]

629
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:38,678
Whoo!

630
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:46,550
I got it! Whoo!

631
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:49,820
Yeah! Yeah, run!

632
00:55:57,434 --> 00:55:59,163
Strike three!

633
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,539
How do you like that, folks?
The Timberwolves win again.

634
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:08,374
Now they're going to face
the defending champion Baboons
in the league final.

635
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,676
[Man]
Hey, gang, free hot dogs!

636
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:18,612
Oh, I'm so hungry!

637
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:58,889
- How was baseball?
- Fine.

638
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:01,590
I guess.

639
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,771
You saw the baby's room?

640
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:11,774
You mean, Josh's.

641
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:15,403
Honey, we're gonna build a new room
above the garage forJosh.

642
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:19,176
Then the baby can be closer
to us and his big sis.

643
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:22,582
- But, Mom...
- Honey, you said you
didn't want his room.

644
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:25,280
I know.

645
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:30,088
I didn't wantJosh's room because
I just wanted it to stay the same.

646
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,288
Oh.

647
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:37,424
Honey, I want you
to understand something.

648
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:41,267
Just because we're changing
Josh's room, doesn't mean...

649
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:43,329
we're getting rid ofJosh.

650
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:46,466
And just because we have
a new member in this family...

651
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:49,034
doesn't mean
that he or you...

652
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:53,208
anytime ever,
will be replaced.

653
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:56,949
- It feels like it.
- Oh.

654
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,717
We have been so busy
with Noah lately.

655
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,851
I'm sorry if you felt left out. I
should've talked to you about it sooner.

656
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,996
I miss Josh.

657
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:13,900
Honey, I know you do.
So do I.

658
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,234
[Whimpers]

659
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:38,160
[Sighs]

660
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:54,400
Okay, Buddy, let's go.

661
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:59,649
[Gasps]

662
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:07,213
Oh, no, Josh's watch!

663
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:25,734
[Professor]
There he is.

664
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:43,653
It's gotta be here.
Where is it?

665
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:46,287
Andrea.

666
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:50,055
[Chittering]

667
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:52,158
What are you doing here?

668
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:57,400
Your mom.
She said I'd find you here.

669
00:59:57,474 --> 01:00:02,502
- I came to...
- I don't need your help.
You've helped me enough.

670
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,480
Did you think you were helping
me when you had to talk to the
coach to get me on the team?

671
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:09,348
Sorry. I should
have talked to you first.

672
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:12,479
Yeah, you should've!
And if I had known...

673
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:16,457
Well, I don't know
exactly what. But...

674
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:21,657
I only did it so we could play together.
We do everything together.

675
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:25,599
I didn't wanna play if you weren't
gonna be on the team.

676
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:30,629
- And that's exactly what I told Coach.
- Oh.

677
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:43,545
There's Rocky.

678
01:00:46,056 --> 01:00:49,116
- [Chittering]
- [Barks]

679
01:00:49,192 --> 01:00:51,717
[Together]
Rocky!

680
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:08,303
- [Buddy Barking]
- Buddy? Buddy!

681
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,544
Buddy!

682
01:01:12,615 --> 01:01:16,346
- We have got to hurry!
- Buddy! Buddy!

683
01:01:16,419 --> 01:01:19,877
- Hey, that's my dog!
- Hurry up, get in the car!
Quick! Hurry up!

684
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:22,049
- Buddy!
- Quick, get your bike!

685
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:28,927
Go, Carlton, go!

686
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,525
They're chasing us!

687
01:01:32,602 --> 01:01:34,866
- Faster! Faster!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

688
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:37,236
[Professor]
Move!

689
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:42,274
- [Tires Screeching]
- Pedal faster, Andrea!

690
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:47,549
Come on, Tammy.
We're gaining on 'em!

691
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:50,882
Quick!
They're after us! Faster!

692
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:54,913
- I'm going as fast as I can. Don't.
- Stop. Get him outta the way.

Mommy!

696
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:07,095
Whoo-ooo-ooo!

697
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:12,071
- [Barking]
- Okay?

698
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,547
- [Andrea] Buddy!
- Beautiful. [Whistles]

699
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:31,722
- Stop! That's my dog!
- Oh, Sheriff!

700
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:39,799
- Keep your eyes on the road!
- I am keeping my eyes on the road.

[Siren Wailing]

702
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:48,606
This way!

703
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:58,586
[Tammy]
Come on.

704
01:02:58,655 --> 01:03:01,920
I think we lost 'em.

705
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:05,256
[Chuckles] We've done it, Carlton.
We have them all.

706
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:07,023
[Chuckling]

707
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:16,436
That's them!
Hurry, after 'em!

708
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:22,806
- Good work, Carlton.
- Thank you, boss.

709
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,313
[Chuckling]

710
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:31,444
Andrea, go!

711
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:35,489
Dad-gum,
where the heck are they?

712
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:43,631
[Professor Chuckling]

713
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:49,203

716
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:01,573
- Hey, Rocky.
- He stinks! [Spitting]

717
01:04:02,986 --> 01:04:07,047
- Watch the road!
- [Screaming] Buddy!

718
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,191
Hey there,
baseball fans!

719
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,889
Welcome to the championship game
between the Baboons...

720
01:04:13,963 --> 01:04:17,194
and your own
Fernfield Timberwolves!

721
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:19,758
[Grunting]

722
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:24,068
Good news for the Timberwolves.
Tammy Slayton will start today's
game back from the injured list.

723
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,938
I didn't see Andrea, Tammy
or Buddy anywhere.

724
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,535
They should be here
by now.

725
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:32,547
Coach, I need a batter.

726
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:35,140
Well, I've got three
of my players still missing.

727
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:37,914
Yeah, I'm sorry, Coach.
We're gonna have to start without 'em.

728
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:41,684
Let's... play ball!

729
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,950
There ya go.

730
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,830
Oh, no!
It looks like the Timberwolves...

731
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:53,733
are missing their three best players...
Andrea, Tammy and Buddy.

732
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:56,704
[Muffled Sounds]
Batter up!

733
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:59,071
Oh, this is terrible news
for Fernfield.

734
01:04:59,142 --> 01:05:02,111
They'll have to start the game
with not a full roster.

735
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:04,271
What will we do
if they don't show up?

736
01:05:04,347 --> 01:05:06,372
[Sighs]
Well, I'm afraid, Terrance...

737
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:09,577
we're just gonna have to do the best
we can with whatever team we've got.

738
01:05:29,806 --> 01:05:31,933
Come on, this way.

739
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:33,999
They're sneakin' around.

740
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:40,779
Oh, I bet they're all in there.

741
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,785
[Barking]

742
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,686
Oh, you stupid...

743
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:55,089
Let go of him.

744
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,537
Well, folks, it looks like
the Baboons'pitcher has brought
his "A"game to the ballpark.

745
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:03,595
Strike three!

746
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:06,039
[Echo]
Three! Three!

747
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:08,873
He is throwing some
serious heat out there.

748
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,606
Excuse me.

749
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,547
Did you find her?

750
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:18,383
No, I haven't.
I called Tammy's house. Nobody's home.

751
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:21,719
- She knew when the game started.
I can't imagine she'd forget.
- I know.

752
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:25,488
[Terrance]
My ball!

753
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:28,230
Safe!

754
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:32,234
And he's safe at the plate. The Baboons
are quickly on board, one to nothing.

755
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:46,411

758
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:24,578
Well, let's go.

759
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:36,128
[Chittering]

760
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:38,963
[Barking]

761
01:07:45,508 --> 01:07:48,443
- [Barks]
- Buddy.

762
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:50,809
- Buddy.
- [Barks]

763
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:54,345
Table.

764
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:06,792
- [Barks]
- Hurry.

765
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:11,095
- Did you hear something?
- Shh!

766
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:14,830
Josh's watch.
Thanks, Buddy.

767
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:16,963
I gotta get you outta here.

768
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:21,969
[Whispering]
Hurry, Andrea.

769
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:23,568
[Barking]

770
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:28,514
- Shh! Quiet!
- [Barking]

771
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,643
[Andrea]
Come on, guys, hurry!

772
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:35,285
[Gasps, Gulps]

773
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:43,789
Professor!

774
01:08:47,437 --> 01:08:49,837
Go... after them!

775
01:08:49,906 --> 01:08:53,171
[Professor]
Get in the car!

776
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:56,040
[Barking]

777
01:08:56,112 --> 01:08:59,673
Go, go, go!
No! Stop, stop, stop!

778
01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:03,480
Idiot! Go!
Now go! Go!

779
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:15,226
Randy's got himself
in a bind here, folks.

780
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:19,667
The bases are loaded and the Baboons'
cleanup hitter is at the dish.

781
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:22,226
[Man]
Come on now.

782
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:27,299
And there's a line shot up the middle
that's going right to the fence, folks.

783
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:29,708
Two runs are gonna score
for sure.

784
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:32,839
Here comes the relay from center field.
Oh, it's not even close.

785
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:35,349
S-Safe!

786
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:38,854
That's three runs. And the Baboons
now lead four to nothing.

787
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:41,913
I tell ya, Randy's
losing it out there.

788
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:45,483
And still Andrea, Tammy and Buddy
are nowhere to be seen.

789
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,257
We're losing them.
Faster, faster!

790
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,899
Hurry!

791
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:57,429
[Siren Wailing]

792
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:08,778
Eh. Oh, darn.

793
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:12,546
All right, come out of there,
you varmints!

794
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:14,556
What the heck?

795
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:19,522
Where do you think
you're goin'?

796
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:22,428
- What-What do you...
- [Chittering]

797
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:26,730
Okay. I hope
you don't get carsick.

798
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:29,464
Back at the ballpark,
and the Timberwolves...

799
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:32,337
are really struggling
with this tough Baboon team.

800
01:10:32,408 --> 01:10:36,071
- Run it out, baby! Run it out!
- Safe! Oh!

801
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,245
- Baboons'big slugger
steps up to the plate.
- [Kid] Hit it over the fence.

802
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:44,081
Here's the pitch!

803
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:49,318
Swing! It's a long hit to left!
It's, it's outta here!

804
01:10:49,392 --> 01:10:53,328
Two more runs scored.
That's six to one for the Baboons.

805
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:56,593
Things are looking hopeless
for Fernfield. Randy's arm is shot.

806
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:59,658
There's no relief on the bench.
And worst of all...

807
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:03,171
we're still missing Andrea, Tammy
and Buddy from the field.

808
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,474
They're gaining on us!

809
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:10,501
Quick. We've got them!
We've got them now! [Laughing]

810
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:14,414
- Hurry up, Tammy!
- I'm a-goin'.

811
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:17,816
- Wait. Where's the net?
- Oh, I'll get it.

812
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:19,821
No!
What are you doing, you idiot?

813
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:28,289
- Get that... I can't see!
- Professor!

814
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:32,095
My eyes!
Get it off of me!

815
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:36,769
[Squealing]

816
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,472

818
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:52,353
- Professor!
- What?

819
01:11:58,227 --> 01:12:00,787
Whoa. Whoa!

821
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:23,112
Oh, no, the game!

822
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:25,153
Come on!

823
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:30,221
Strike three!
You're outta here!

824
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:35,320
He strikes him out again.
The Fernfield Timberwolves
go out in order again...

825
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:38,162
and the Baboons
keep rolling along.

826

Carlton!

829
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:02,113
- Sorry.
- You're sorry?

830
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:06,719
- You're sorry? You, you idiot!
- I'm not an idiot!

Get out of my way!
Let, let go of me! Ohhh!

834
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:24,411
What are you looking at?
This is all your...

835
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,075
Ohhh! A pond.

Strike... three!

844
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:11,353
Swing and a miss. She struck
him out. That's Terrance's
third whiff on the afternoon.

845
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:22,500
[Man]
Hurry! Come look at the dogs!

I hope we're not too late.
- Don't worry, we'll make it.

[Mailman Phil] Holy cow!
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

are back!

01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:29,426
Let's play ball!

861
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:31,598
You're up.

862
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:33,073
[Barking]

863
01:15:33,142 --> 01:15:35,042
[Mr. Fusilli]
Let's go, Timberwolves!

864
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:40,112
The Timberwolves look like they have
new energy with Andrea and Buddy back.

865
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:42,446
But could it be too little,
too late?

866
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:46,045
We'll have to see, because the Baboons
have a seven to one commanding lead...

867
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:48,351
here in the top
of the seventh.

868
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:50,358
There's a sharp ground ball
to Terrance.

869
01:15:50,426 --> 01:15:52,587
He's up and over to first.

870
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:55,630
- You're outta there!
- [Cheering]

871
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,962
Great arm, Andrea!

872
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:00,934
[Child]
You rule, Buddy!

873
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:09,272
Here's the pitch
from Andrea.

874
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:14,112
It's a towering fly ball
way over top of home plate.

875
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:17,152
- Yeah! Good job!
- [Barking]

876
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,388
Mmm, yeah.

877
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,418
And here's the pitch
on the way from Andrea.

878
01:16:24,493 --> 01:16:27,894
Pop fly to left. Easy out.

879
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:31,763
Nice work by Framm. She shut down
the Baboons at the top of the seventh.

880
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,995
Now the Timberwolves
are gonna have to...

881
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:37,163
get a rally going if they wanna
come back and win this game.

882
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:45,102
- That's a solid line drive
base hit up the middle.
- Good job.

883
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:55,189
Andrea takes a lead off first base.
She might be thinking of stealing.

884
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:57,157
And there she goes!
Look at her go!

885
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:59,524
Run, Andrea, run!

886
01:16:59,595 --> 01:17:02,496
Safe!

887
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:06,835
That's some real heads-up
base running by Andrea...

888
01:17:06,902 --> 01:17:09,234
as she moves
into scoring position.

889
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:12,138
She's got this Timberwolves
team all fired up.

890
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:16,041
- [Player] That was great, Andrea!
- Here's the pitch.

891
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:19,638
Ground ball right to the second baseman.
Andrea's caught in a run-down.

892
01:17:19,715 --> 01:17:24,311
Over to the third baseman.
Oh, she's a dead duck. Uh-oh!

893
01:17:26,255 --> 01:17:29,315
- Andrea's safe at third.
- [Cheering]

894
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:35,624
Safe!

895
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:37,996
- [Cheering]
- [Shouting]

896
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:41,127
[Howling]

897
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,194
At the end
of the seventh inning...

898
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:46,400
the Timberwolves have
narrowed the Baboons' lead to five runs.

899
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:51,976
That's a hard hit ball to Terrance.
He's up with it cleanly.

900
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,811
Over to first.
And it's Buddy with the out!

901
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:58,979
[Cheering]

902
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:05,390
There's a swing and a hard liner
to left field for a base hit.

903
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:06,826
- Whoo!
- All right!

904
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:19,665
And another shot
to left field!

905
01:18:19,742 --> 01:18:23,576
- Go, Terrance!
- Here comes Terrance.
He's gonna try to score.

906
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:27,741
- Safe!
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

907
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:35,389
At the end of eight innings, the Baboons
lead the Timberwolves seven to three.

908
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:40,857
A hard-hit ball
to left field.

909
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,557
Saf... Outta there!

910
01:18:47,202 --> 01:18:51,764
- And the pitch from Andrea.
- You got it, Buddy!

911
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,606
- Oh, what a great catch by Buddy!
- Andrea!

912
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:08,280
- Way to go, Buddy!
- Well, despite Andrea's
solid pitching performance...

913
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:11,758
it's still not looking
too good for Fernfield.

914
01:19:11,827 --> 01:19:13,795
They're down by four
heading into the ninth.

915
01:19:13,862 --> 01:19:18,128
They're gonna need a miracle
if they're gonna win this championship.

916
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,067
All right, now, we've all been here
before. You all know what to do.

917
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:25,596
And I just wanna tell you guys
it's really been my honor
coaching you this year.

918
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:27,835
All right?

919
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,474
So, all in.

920
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,417
One, two, three...
Timberwolves!

921
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:40,114
Hey, Mom.

922
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,123
- Honey! Hi!
- How's it goin'?

923
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:44,159
Oh, my gosh!

924
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:46,660
- How's it going?
- I didn't know you were gonna drive up.

925
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:49,128
- I didn't know you
were coming. You just...
- Snuck in.

926
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,429
- Did you come to surprise your sister?
- Yeah, I just came.

927
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:55,629
- Oh! You're so big!
- See, it's your brother.

928
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:59,868
It's no balls and one strike
to Terrance. Here's the pitch.

929
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:02,672
Strike two!

930
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:09,480
Strike three!
You're outta here!

931
01:20:09,551 --> 01:20:13,180
The Baboons are only two outs away
from winning another league title.

932
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:17,149
Let's go!

933
01:20:17,226 --> 01:20:20,889
Oh, the Timberwolves are
down to their final out.

934
01:20:20,963 --> 01:20:24,524
It looks like the Baboons
are gonna win their third
straight league championship.

935
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,694
The next batter for the Timberwolves
is Buddy Framm.

936
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:29,964
It's okay, guys.
I can handle Buddy.

937
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:32,370
[Man]
Ahh, Buddy!

938
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:37,307
There's a swing and a hot ground ball
to the shortstop.

939
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,813
He's up with it.
Buddy's got his jets on.

940
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:42,976
- Safe!
- Whoo!

941
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:46,810
That's what I call
dogged determination.

942
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:50,723
Buddy's on first,
and the Timberwolves are still alive.

943
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,098
Buddy's gonna try
for second!

944
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:04,037
- And he's there!
- Way to go, Buddy!

945
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:16,580
There's a ground ball to the right side
of the infield for a base hit.

946
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:18,916
Buddy, home!

947
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:21,683
It looks like Buddy's
gonna try to score!

948
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,248
Slide, slide, slide!

949
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:31,895
- Safe!
- Whoo!

950
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:35,300
Good slide!
Good slide!

951
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:38,396
The lead is down to three.

952
01:21:38,473 --> 01:21:41,533
Now Tammy is up
for the Timberwolves.

953
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:44,773
Let's see if she can keep
this rally goin'.

954
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:47,712
Here's the pitch.

955
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:50,308
Strike one!

956
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:55,885
Wait a minute, folks.
Tammy is switching to bat left-handed.

957
01:21:55,958 --> 01:22:00,827
You don't see that very often.
Let's see how the Baboon pitcher reacts.

958
01:22:00,896 --> 01:22:03,228
Swing and a hard ball
to left!

959
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:06,597
Way to go, Tammy!
Yeah!

960
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:16,001
[Crowd Cheering]

961
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:20,344
Now Randy's up.
Let's see what he can do.

962
01:22:20,415 --> 01:22:22,610
Swing, and it's a long drive
to right field.

963
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:26,347
The ball is going way back
to the fence.

964
01:22:34,263 --> 01:22:37,027
- Safe!
- He's safe!

965
01:22:39,268 --> 01:22:43,364
Well, baseball fans, it doesn't
get any more exciting than this.

966
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:45,429
The Timberwolves are down
by one run.

967
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:49,671
Bottom of the ninth. Two out.
Andrea Framm represents the winning run.

968
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:52,771
You could cut the tension
in this ballpark with a knife.

969
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:56,113
You can do it,
Andrea.

970
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:58,152
[Whispering]
Out of the park.

971
01:23:05,294 --> 01:23:07,228
Josh!

972
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:09,059
Good luck.

973
01:23:16,104 --> 01:23:20,404
What a pressure situation
for Andrea.

974
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:23,808
It's all up to her now.

975
01:23:23,879 --> 01:23:26,074
Here's the pitch.

976
01:23:26,148 --> 01:23:28,742
Ooh! Andrea took
a big cut on that one.

977
01:23:28,817 --> 01:23:30,580
Strike one!

978
01:23:30,652 --> 01:23:32,586
- It's okay, honey.
- Wait for it.

979
01:23:32,654 --> 01:23:35,885
Keep your eye on the ball.
Follow it through the zone.

980
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:40,588
Strike two!

981
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:43,756
She's down
to her last strike, folks!

982
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,237
Time.

983
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,573
Time!

984
01:24:02,851 --> 01:24:05,183
It's okay.

985
01:24:17,165 --> 01:24:20,225
[Barking]

986
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,214
And there's a long drive
back to right field!

987
01:24:42,724 --> 01:24:45,420
Run!

988
01:24:45,494 --> 01:24:49,123
It's going back, back,
back, back!

989
01:24:49,197 --> 01:24:51,722
Run, Andrea, run!

990
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,145
Safe!

991
01:25:40,215 --> 01:25:43,548
[Cheering]

992
01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:47,315
Fernfield wins!
Fernfield wins!

993
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:55,389
Fernfield wins!

994
01:26:02,404 --> 01:26:05,066
Fernfield wins!
[Laughing]

995
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,576
[Crowd Chanting]
Andrea! Andrea!

996
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:22,284
[Chanting]
Andrea! Andrea!

997
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:30,020
And this just in, folks. Andrea Framm
has won M.V.P. Of this year's finals.

998
01:26:30,098 --> 01:26:32,658
Way to go, Andrea!

999
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:40,697
Thanks.

1000
01:26:40,775 --> 01:26:43,107
Hey, Andrea.

1001
01:26:43,178 --> 01:26:46,011
Great game.
This belongs to you.

1002
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:50,284
Thanks.

1003
01:26:56,992 --> 01:26:59,426
Josh, you came!

1004
01:26:59,494 --> 01:27:03,863
Wouldn't have missed
the big game.

1005
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:15,038
You played so awesome!
Let's go.

1006
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:17,977
I missed you so much.

1007
01:27:22,817 --> 01:27:25,183
[Phone Ringing]

1008
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:28,017
Hello?

1009
01:27:28,089 --> 01:27:31,581
You mean Buddy?

1010
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:41,966
Welcome back to Edison Field
in Anaheim, California,
where the Anaheim Angels...

1011
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:47,475
are now just two outs away from winning
their first ever World Series.

1012
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:52,741
This will most certainly
be remembered as one of the
greatest World Series of all.

1013
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:55,806
These Anaheim Angels
have been electrified...

1014
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:59,650
by the sensational play
of their first baseman, Air Bud.

1015
01:28:04,559 --> 01:28:06,959
Here's the pitch.

1016
01:28:07,028 --> 01:28:09,258
Ground ball
to the second baseman.

1017
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:12,994
He might be able to turn two. He tags
the bag for one. There's the throw.

1018
01:28:13,068 --> 01:28:17,664
And that's it. The Anaheim Angels
have won the World Series!

1019
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:31,980
All right, Buddy!

1020
01:28:32,053 --> 01:28:35,318
Whoo! Buddy!
Buddy! Buddy!

1021
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:40,528
Air Bud has done it again!

1022
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:52,469
#Mmm-mmm #

1023
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:58,141
# What we've learned
from each other #

1024
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:03,515
# Couldn't fit
in a single book #

1025
01:29:03,585 --> 01:29:08,420
#Sometimes a thousand words
aren't worth #

1026
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:12,586
#As much as a single look #

1027
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:15,858
# They say grasses are greener #

01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:20,731
# On the other side
of the hill #

1029
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:24,932
#Nothing can brighten
your own backyard #

1030
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:29,466
# The way a friendship will #

1031
01:29:29,544 --> 01:29:34,311
# Whenever I need
a helping hand #

1032
01:29:34,382 --> 01:29:38,216
# Or two or three or four #

1033
01:29:38,286 --> 01:29:43,053
# You are there
to understand #

1034
01:29:43,124 --> 01:29:47,458
#And I don't need any more #

1035
01:29:47,529 --> 01:29:50,862
# They say you can't weather
the storm #

1036
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:55,460
# Till you learn to fly
with the wind #

1037
01:29:55,537 --> 01:29:59,940
#Like birds of a feather
We'll stick together #

1038
01:30:00,008 --> 01:30:04,638
# Get out of any trouble
that we get into #

1039
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:10,049
#Friends
We're such an unlikely pair #

1040
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:15,586
# To the end #

1041
01:30:15,657 --> 01:30:21,857
#Knowing each other
will always be there #

1042
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:28,460
# Together whenever
the going gets tough #

1043
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:35,100
# The waters of life
seem too rough for us #

1044
01:30:35,176 --> 01:30:40,273
# Together
Our friendship will always #

1045
01:30:40,348 --> 01:30:46,309
#Always be there #

1046
01:30:46,387 --> 01:30:51,415
#Mmm, mmm, mmm #

1047
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:55,190
# Will always be there #

1048
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:03,469
# Will always be there ##
