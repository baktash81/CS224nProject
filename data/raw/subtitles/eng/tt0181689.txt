The music relaxes the prisoners.

326
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:17,358
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?

327
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,695
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.

328
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:24,449
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.

329
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,535
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.

330
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:31,164
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

331
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:35,793
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

332
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,003
Stop.

She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

- That's right.

based on all three previsions.

GIDEON: They'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

343

Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.

344
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,570
But on the inside: busy, busy, busy.

345
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:49,283
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.

346
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,995
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

347
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,999
The killer's a John Doe,
never identified.

348
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,602
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

349
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:21,524
Those are not his eyes. He had them
swapped out to fool the scanners.

350
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:25,695
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

This is odd. See?

356
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:53,431
We have the two previsions. We got
what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

357
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,642
But Agatha's isn't here.

358
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,521
Probably just a glitch.

359
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,026
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

360
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:09,405
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here.

361

Address history
includes the Beaton Clinic.

362
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,912
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?

363
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,416
I guess glitches come in twos.

BURGESS: The third prevision was what,
kind of fuzzy or something?

370
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,462
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

371
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:11,342
That's not all. There are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions.

Herbal tea with honey.

Almost as much as I hate honey.

Yeah, give him a tour.

Quite frankly, so am I.

a lot of time in the Sprawl.

390
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,865

..."You don't choose the things

your loss would have been prevented.

I'm not the generation
anyone listens to...

...but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in Precrime.

398
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:48,731
They know that it's a belief born of
pain, not politics. I understood that.
