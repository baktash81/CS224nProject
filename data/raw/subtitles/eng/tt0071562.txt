1
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:43,831
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:47,876
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,212
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,599
My son...

5
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,271
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,654
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,491
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,786
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,540
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,168
He never speaks.

11
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,921
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,009
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,471
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,558
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,569
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:43,534
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,203
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:51,750
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,177
Vito, run!

20
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,387
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,723
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,730
Kill him!

23
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:27,619
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,290
You understand?

25
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:45,345
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,665
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,008
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,886
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,514
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,685
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:50,535
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,464
Nurse.

33
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,450
Money?

34
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,495
Interpreter!

35
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,462
Where are you from?

36
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,714
- What is your name?
- Maria.

37
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,388
What is your name?

38
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,642
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,898
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,735
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,571
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,490
Next.

43
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,504
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,557
Vito Corleone!

45
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,685
Vito Corleone!

46
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,272
Here he is. This is him.

47
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,589
Did you bring the car keys?

48
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,427
Laurie! Laurie!

49
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,866
Mama!

50
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,494
Mama!

51
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,457
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

52
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,877
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

53
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,548
Mama!

54
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,761
- Here I am.
- Constanzia, after one week?

55
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,682
I sent the car to the airport
last week to pick you up.

56
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,519
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am,
just one week late.

57
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,646
And this is for my mama.

58
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,066
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

59
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,902
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

60
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,821
Where's Michael?
I've got to talk to him,

61
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,241
and I can't wait on line.

62
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,077
You go see your children first.

63
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,539
Then you worry about waiting on line
to see your brother.

64
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,291
Like everybody else.

65
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,798
Ladies and gentlemen...

66
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,261
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

67
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:27,724
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.

68
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,560
And there is Mrs. Geary.

69
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,822
Thank you very much.

70
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:49,412
This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs. Geary.

71
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,625
We see Nevada far too seldom.

72
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,672
But today we can join with
old friends, we can make new friends

73
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,467
and we help celebrate
a young man's first communion.

74
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,262
And also to thank that boy's family

75
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,641
for a magnificent contribution
to the State.

76
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:16,189
I have here in my hand a check
made out to the university,

77
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:21,069
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of..

78
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,281
Anthony Vito Corleone.

79
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,494
The check is signed by
that young man's parents

80
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,414
whom I think we should recognize.

81
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,793
Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you.

82
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,962
Folks, I want you to join me

83
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:44,801
in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

84
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,062
We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir

85
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:02,694
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement

86
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,823
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

87
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,408
Boys.

88
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,926
The plaque.

89
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,846
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

90
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,849
Okay, that's good.

91
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,853
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs. Corleone.

92
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,461
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

93
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,881
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

94
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,926
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

95
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,724
I thought that you and I
would talk alone.

96
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,852
I trust these men
with my life, Senator.

97
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,397
To ask them to leave
would be an insult.

98
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,859
Well, it's perfectly all right with me

99
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:29,781
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

100
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,200
Maybe more frankly

101
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,161
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.

102
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,373
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

103
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:43,753
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas

104
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:48,258
and one in Reno.
The licenses were grandfathered in

105
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,845
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

106
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,891
Now my sources tell me

107
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,603
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

108
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:05,692
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

109
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,986
Quite an expansion.

110
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,073
However, it will leave you
with a little technical problem.

111
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,245
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

112
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,248
Turnbull is a good man.

113
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,084
Yeah, well, let's cut out
the bullshit.

114
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,211
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

115
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,923
You can have the license.

116
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,467
The price is 250,000 dollars.

117
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,554
Plus 50% of the gross monthly

118
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:39,225
of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.

119
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:47,901
The price for the license
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

120
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,236
That's right.

121
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,034
- Why would I pay more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

122
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,703
I don't like your kind of people.

123
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:04,208
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair

124
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,753
dressed up in those silk suits

125
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,840
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

126
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,425
I'll do business with you,

127
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,512
but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

128
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:22,185
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

129
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,361
Senator,

130
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,782
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

131
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,536
But never think
it applies to my family.

132
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,748
All right, all right.

133
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,712
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

134
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,802
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

135
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,848
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

136
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,227
Don't you contact me again, ever.

137
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,314
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

138
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,777
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

139
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,324
My offer is this...

140
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,243
Nothing.

141
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,788
Not even the fee
for the gaming license,

142
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,417
which I would like you to put up.

143
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,174
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

144
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,471
Ladies! I didn't know
you were out here.

145
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,641
- Honey, we have to go.
- Really? I'm sorry.

146
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,020
- It's been delightful.
- It was our pleasure.

147
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,023
It was wonderful talking to you.

148
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,655
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

149
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,657
Frank Pentangeli!

150
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,952
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

151
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,664
I've got to check on my boys.

152
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,876
- Fredo, what's with the food here?
- What's the matter?

153
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:57,757
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker with
chopped liver and says, "canapés".

154
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,094
I said, "Can of peas, my ass.

155
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,262
"That's a Ritz cracker
and chopped liver!"

156
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:09,519
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

157
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,439
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

158
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:20,071
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

159
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,077
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack?

160
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,163
No, that was no heart attack.

161
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,334
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

162
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,546
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

163
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:42,009
Do I have to get a letter
of introduction to get a sit-down?

164
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:46,764
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

165
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,479
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

166
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:04,323
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
- I remember Tom from the old days.

167
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,159
Rocco.

168
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,163
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

169
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,124
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

170
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,292
Johnny?

171
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,549
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

172
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,510
Sure, Mike.

173
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,728
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

174
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,775
If you need anything, I'll be outside.

175
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,361
Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

176
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,787
- I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
- How is his health?

177
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,789
It's not good.

178
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,418
Can I do anything or send anything?

179
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:02,381
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

180
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,217
That casino...

181
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,553
Registered owners.
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay.

182
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,305
Beverly Hills attorneys.

183
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,267
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group

184
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,478
and our friend in Miami.

185
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:19,649
Klingman runs it
and owns a piece of it too,

186
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,651
but I've been instructed to tell you

187
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,696
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

188
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,828
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

189
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,875
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

190
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,047
One by one, our old friends are gone.

191
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,842
Death, natural or not,

192
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,637
prison, deported...

193
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:56,310
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

194
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,605
I can't believe it!

195
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,818
Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

196
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,487
Let's have a tarantella!

197
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,370
You! Up, up, up!

198
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,339
Questa mano!

199
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,551
Questa mano!

200
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,268
What the hell have we here?

201
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:53,701
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. May I stay?

202
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,205
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

203
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,500
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink?

204
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,174
Al, please get him a drink!

205
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,180
We're going to Europe.
I'd like to book passage on The Queen.

206
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,099
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

207
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,976
We're getting married first.

208
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,365
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

209
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,244
You see your children on weekends.

210
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,039
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno

211
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,458
for a theft you don't even know about.

212
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,711
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

213
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,506
- You're not my father!
- So why come to me?

214
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,965
I need money.

215
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,190
Connie, Connie, Connie...

216
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,907
I want to be reasonable with you.

217
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,911
Why don't you stay with the family?

218
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,998
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

219
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,377
You won't be deprived of anything.

220
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:36,554
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

221
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,224
Tell him marriage
is out of the question

222
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,977
and you don't want to see him anymore.

223
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,604
He'll understand, believe me.

224
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,448
Connie.

225
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,620
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

226
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,127
you'll disappoint me.

227
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:44,330
- Famiglia!
- Cent' anni!

228
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,916
What's "Chen dannay"?

229
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,044
Cent' anni. It means 100 years.

230
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:54,507
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

231
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,634
It would be true
if my father were alive.

232
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,093
Connie.

233
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,304
Hey...

234
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,308
Merle, you've met
my sister-in-law, Deanna.

235
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,060
- Fredo's wife.
- My pleasure.

236
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:20,699
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

237
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,743
I know, I know.

238
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:58,445
- I just want to dance!
- You're falling all over the floor.

239
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,241
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

240
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm going to belt you
right in the teeth.

241
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,079
You couldn't belt your mama!

242
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,125
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

243
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,130
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

244
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,133
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop.

245
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:24,722
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

246
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:31,103
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

247
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,479
Fredo!

248
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:37,359
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, don't apologize.

249
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,992
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers
three territories after he died.

250
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,785
You took over
and didn't give it to them.

251
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,287
I welched.

252
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,958
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.

253
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:58,589
- He hated them more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

254
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,301
You're sitting up
in the Sierra Mountains

255
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,719
and you're drinking...

256
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,971
- What's he drinking?
- Champagne.

257
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:10,100
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgment on how I run my family.

258
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,189
Your family's still called Corleone.

259
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,526
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

260
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,614
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

261
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,824
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

262
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,785
...with Hyman Roth!

263
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,670
You're a good old man and I like you.

264
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,090
You were loyal to my father for years.

265
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,804
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

266
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,392
They spit right in my face,

267
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,936
all because they're backed up
by that Jew in Miami.

268
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,855
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

269
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,818
- Not touched?
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

270
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:05,948
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

271
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:12,413
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

272
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:16,208
They do violence
in their grandmothers' neighborhoods!

273
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:22,881
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

274
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,634
And they leave the gambling to last.

275
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:30,931
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

276
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,851
- No.
- Morte.

277
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:44,069
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

278
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:50,492
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

279
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:57,332
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

280
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:02,337
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

281
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,215
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

282
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:09,094
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

283
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,850
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

284
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:22,065
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

285
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,359
Don Corleone.

286
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,528
Cicci, the door...

287
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,122
You want him to leave now?

288
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,921
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

289
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,674
The old man had too much wine.

290
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,097
It's late.

291
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,945
How's the baby?

292
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,574
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

293
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,786
Yes, it does, Michael.

294
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,706
Kay?

295
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,294
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

296
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,797
It couldn't be helped, though.

297
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,967
It made me think
of what you once told me.

298
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:36,098
"In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

299
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,017
That was seven years ago.

300
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,315
I know. I'm trying, darling.

301
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,631
Did you see this?

302
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,439
Why are the drapes open?

303
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,427
Kay, are you all right?

304
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,097
- Are you hit?
- No.

305
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,351
It's all right.

306
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,647
Stop! Stop!

307
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,984
Halt!

308
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,956
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

309
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,959
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

310
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,502
Alive!

311
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,255
Stay by the door.

312
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,711
Yeah, come in.

313
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,180
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

314
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,603
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

315
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:57,150
And I know
that's upset you in the past.

316
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:02,614
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

317
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:08,537
But it's because I admire you
and love you

318
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,373
that I kept things secret from you.

319
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,961
Now you're the only one I can trust.

320
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,590
Fredo?

321
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,635
Well, he's got a good heart.

322
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,556
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

323
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,102
Tom, you're my brother.

324
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,111
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey.

325
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,904
A real brother.

326
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,951
I know that.

327
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,001
You're going to take over.

328
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,129
You're going to be the Don.

329
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,926
If what I think has happened,
has happened,

330
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,179
I'm leaving here tonight.

331
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:14,394
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

332
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,150
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

333
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,320
and my children,
the future of this family.

334
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:31,494
- If we catch them, will we find out...
- We won't catch them.

335
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,125
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

336
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,796
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

337
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:46,259
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

338
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:50,931
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

339
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,688
See... All our people are businessmen.

340
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,234
Their loyalty is based on that.

341
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,531
One thing I learnt from Pop

342
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,370
was to try to think
as people around you think.

343
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,541
On that basis, anything is possible.

344
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:24,089
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

345
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,592
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

346
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,606
Over here! There's two of them.

347
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,400
Looks like they were hired
out of New York.

348
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,568
I don't recognize them.

349
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,155
Won't get anything out of them now.

350
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,241
Fish them out.

351
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,184
Get rid of the bodies.

352
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,687
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

353
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:56,514
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

354
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:17,369
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

355
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,747
I know. Did you like them?

356
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

357
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,337
Well, they were friends.

358
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,593
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

359
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,265
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

360
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:44,104
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

361
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:49,442
- Why do you have to go?
- I have to do business.

362
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,029
I could help you.

363
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,993
I know. Some day you will.

364
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,497
Get some sleep.

365
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,868
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

366
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:46,726
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

367
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,114
I left Naples. I left Mama.

368
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,284
For a no-good tramp!

369
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,624
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

370
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,296
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

371
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,259
Without news from home.

372
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,520
Finally, a letter from Naples!

373
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,150
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

374
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,987
She's very beautiful.

375
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:44,617
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

376
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:47,078
Our dear mother -

377
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,541
...is dead!

378
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,933
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

379
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,440
Sit down, you bum!

380
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,157
Excuse me, Don Fanucci.

381
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,376
We'll go see her backstage.

382
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,797
Who was that?

383
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,508
The Black Hand.

384
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,459
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

385
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:01,045
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

386
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,049
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

387
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,885
You'll pay me today!

388
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,897
Let's go.

389
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,153
Not my daughter! Let her go!

390
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:28,906
Here, take all my money!

391
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,417
Vito, come on.

392
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,093
I know what you're thinking.
But you don't know how things are.

393
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,097
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

394
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,641
Even my father, in the grocery store.

395
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,018
If he's Italian...

396
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,647
...why does he bother other Italians?

397
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,025
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

398
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,360
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

399
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,362
If you're happy, I'm happy.

400
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,412
Don't you feel well?

401
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,502
Is your boss treating you all right?

402
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,005
Forget it.

403
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:24,105
Hey, you speak Italian?

404
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,987
Hide this for me!

405
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,823
Next week I'll come and get it!

406
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,781
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

407
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,788
How's business?

408
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,088
It's good, it's good.

409
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:41,140
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

410
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:45,102
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

411
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,688
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

412
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,821
So Fanucci's changing?

413
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,616
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

414
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,827
Even from my father.

415
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,957
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

416
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,157
I've got some bad news.

417
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:47,164
I feel rotten
about telling you this...

418
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:54,380
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

419
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,723
And you have to give him my job.

420
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,768
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

421
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,188
You looked after me like a father.

422
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,024
I thank you.

423
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,485
And I won't forget it.

424
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,917
Vito!

425
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,882
No!

426
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,218
Take this to your family.

427
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,057
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

428
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,219
What a nice pear!

429
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,245
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

430
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,416
Did you look inside?

431
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,629
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

432
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:14,436
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

433
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,864
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

434
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:30,327
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

435
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,546
Yeah, sure.

436
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,631
My wife would like it.

437
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,575
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

438
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,414
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

439
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,421
Well, he won't mind.

440
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,017
Come on in.

441
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,230
Hey, Vito, come on in!

442
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,212
This is your friend's place?

443
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,800
This is a real palace.

444
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,010
One of the best.

445
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,602
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

446
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,138
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

447
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,372
Come on in.

448
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:53,585
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

449
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,507
- Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- No, thank you.

450
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,559
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

451
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,355
- Mr. Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

452
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,776
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

453
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,530
It's almost over.

454
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:28,328
- Do you follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

455
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,999
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

456
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:36,169
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

457
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:43,343
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

458
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,100
I heard you had some trouble.

459
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,023
Stupid.

460
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:59,818
People behaving like that with guns.

461
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,990
The important thing
is you're all right.

462
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:08,201
Good health
is the most important thing.

463
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:11,705
More than success, more than money.

464
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,125
More than power.

465
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,643
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

466
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,564
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

467
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,317
Nobody wants another war.

468
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:47,157
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

469
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,077
When I refused,
he tried to have me killed.

470
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,495
He was stupid, I was lucky.

471
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,038
I'll visit him soon.

472
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,249
The important thing is that

473
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,628
nothing interferes
with our plans for the future.

474
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,672
Nothing is more important.

475
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:08,637
- You're a wise and considerate man.
- And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.

476
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:14,810
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

477
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,690
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

478
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:24,903
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're going to break your eardrums.

479
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,532
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

480
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,373
You're young, I'm old and sick.

481
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:41,920
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

482
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,298
It's never been done before.

483
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:50,220
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

484
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,685
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

485
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,231
He's small potatoes.

486
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,285
What's up?

487
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,290
We got company?

488
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:33,972
What's going on?

489
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,932
Michael Corleone is here.

490
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,436
Where is he?

491
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,354
He's in your den. You better hurry.

492
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:44,316
He's been waiting a half hour.

493
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,742
Is something wrong?

494
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,374
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

495
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:05,378
- I could have prepared something.
- I didn't want you to know.

496
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:17,224
- You heard what happened?
- I almost died. We were so relieved...

497
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,892
In my home!

498
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,398
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

499
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:30,153
Where my children come to play.

500
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,115
In my home.

501
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,426
I want you to help me take my revenge.

502
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,889
Michael, anything. What can I do?

503
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:02,894
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

504
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,982
I don't understand. I don't...

505
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:11,611
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

506
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:16,950
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

507
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:21,621
- I know he is.
- So why ask me to lay down to them?

508
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:30,088
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

509
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,593
I know it was him.

510
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,388
Jesus Christ, Mike.

511
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:42,851
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

512
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:51,151
This used to be my father's old study.

513
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,738
It's changed.

514
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:59,951
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

515
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,081
I remember when I was a kid.

516
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:08,168
We had to be quiet
when we played near here.

517
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:19,262
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

518
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:24,309
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

519
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:31,191
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

520
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,655
He taught me,

521
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:40,533
"Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

522
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,663
If Hyman Roth sees
that I interceded in this,

523
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,040
in the Rosato brothers' favor,

524
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,752
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

525
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,049
That's what I want him to think.

526
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,096
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

527
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:05,976
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

528
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,965
- Yeah?
- Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.

529
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,469
- We need some more help.
- Johnny?

530
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:45,432
Jesus Christ,
what the hell time is it?

531
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,268
- Who's that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

532
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,688
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

533
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:55,233
Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.

534
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,485
- God.
- Will he come alone?

535
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,864
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

536
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,491
Everything will be all right.

537
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:06,202
Pentangeli says
he's willing to make a deal.

538
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,121
All we want to know is if he's
on the level,

539
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,040
or if he'll bring his boys.

540
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:14,169
You lied to me.
I don't want you to call me anymore.

541
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,463
Your brother won't find out we talked

542
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,215
I don't know
what you're talking about.

543
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,229
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

544
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,949
- Frankie, I've got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

545
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,327
- Frankie.
- That's okay, Cicc'.

546
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:59,047
- What's this?
- A lucky C note for our new deal.

547
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,676
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

548
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:11,893
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

549
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:17,023
- You won't regret it.
- I don't like the C note, Rosato.

550
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,818
I take that as an insult.

551
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,362
Michael Corleone says hello!

552
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,673
Close the door!

553
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,551
Your friend the cop...

554
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:48,805
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

555
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:52,100
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

556
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,855
What's the matter?

557
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:00,775
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here!

558
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,485
Anthony!

559
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,324
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

560
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:57,123
Freddy, it's good to see you.

561
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:04,631
- How is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

562
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,345
Girls, take a hike.

563
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,350
In this room here.

564
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:22,523
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on.

565
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,825
I thought I could help you, Senator.

566
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,289
Hagen?

567
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:44,879
- Listen, I did not...
- It's all right.

568
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:49,384
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very lucky.

569
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:55,348
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

570
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:59,519
Had this happened someplace else,
we couldn't have helped you.

571
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:05,483
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

572
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:11,197
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

573
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,036
I passed out.

574
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,556
Just a game. Jesus.

575
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,444
Jesus, Jesus!

576
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,159
Jesus God!

577
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,077
God!

578
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:04,625
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

579
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,128
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

580
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,256
Put in a call to your office.

581
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:13,509
Explain that you'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

582
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:19,515
You decided to spend the night
at Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

583
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:24,062
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

584
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:31,527
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

585
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:36,657
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

586
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:39,285
It'll be as though she never existed.

587
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:44,499
All that's left is our friendship.

588
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:01,099
Yes?

589
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,476
Sorry, but we're not
to let you through.

590
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,689
- I'm just going to the market.
- We'll pick up anything you want.

591
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:11,943
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's. He's coming.

592
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,320
I'll speak to him.

593
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:23,830
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

594
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,249
It's Michael's request
for your safety.

595
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,543
We'll get anything you need.

596
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:33,714
- So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

597
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:37,009
- We were going to New England.
- That's off.

598
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:41,013
- Am I a prisoner?
- That's not how we see it, Kay.

599
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:44,016
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

600
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,354
Joe.

601
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,818
Cuba, Cuba!

602
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,862
Most respected gentlemen.

603
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:22,114
Welcome to Havana.

604
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:27,203
I want to thank
this distinguished group

605
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,705
of American industrialists

606
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,334
for continuing to work with Cuba

607
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:37,213
for the greatest period of prosperity

608
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,758
in her entire history.

609
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,345
Mr. William Shaw,

610
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:47,139
representing the
General Fruit Company.

611
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,142
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

612
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,938
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

613
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:56,774
Mr. Petty,

614
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:00,736
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

615
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,700
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

616
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:09,704
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada,

617
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,126
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

618
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:19,755
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

619
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:23,217
Mr. Hyman Roth.

620
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:27,179
I would like to thank
United Telephone and Telegraph

621
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,681
for their Christmas gift.

622
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,646
A solid gold telephone.

623
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:41,068
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

624
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,572
- Mr. President?
- Yes?

625
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:47,908
Could you discuss the rebel activity

626
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:50,453
and what this can mean
to our businesses?

627
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:51,996
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

628
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:57,960
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,

629
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,469
my staff indicates, with assurance,

630
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:12,433
that we'll drive them out of
Santa Clara before the New Year.

631
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:16,187
I want to put you all at ease.

632
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:20,566
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

633
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,462
He said that they're making an arrest,

634
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,674
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

635
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:45,966
Johnny...

636
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,259
It's nothing.

637
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:50,388
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

638
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:54,934
Viva Fidel!

639
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:14,787
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

640
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:20,459
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

641
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:26,132
I'm very pleased

642
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:30,177
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

643
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:35,057
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

644
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,562
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

645
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:44,608
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

646
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:51,782
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

647
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,493
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

648
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:58,539
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

649
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,962
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

650
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:08,215
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

651
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:13,220
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

652
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:17,308
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

653
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,852
than any of the joints in Vegas.

654
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:22,688
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

655
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,025
which has put up half the cash
with the Teamsters,

656
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,152
on a dollar for dollar basis

657
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:30,696
and has relaxed restrictions
on imports.

658
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:35,659
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

659
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:38,579
Real partnership with a government.

660
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:40,206
Smaller piece.

661
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:46,128
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

662
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:49,882
At the time of my retirement,
or death,

663
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:55,805
I turn over all my interests in
the Havana operation to his control.

664
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:59,558
But all of you will share.

665
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,771
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

666
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:07,274
the Capri to the Corleone family,

667
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,985
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

668
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,614
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

669
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,033
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

670
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,536
and to handle the casino operations.

671
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:22,164
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

672
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:25,417
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

673
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:33,008
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

674
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:35,553
- Happy birthday!
- I 'chaim!

675
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,807
I saw an interesting thing
happen today.

676
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:44,186
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

677
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,272
Rather than be taken alive,

678
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,691
he exploded a grenade he had
in his jacket.

679
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:52,653
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

680
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:56,323
- Those rebels are lunatics.
- Maybe so.

681
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,076
But it occurred to me,

682
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:02,913
that the soldiers are paid to fight,
the rebels aren't.

683
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:06,417
- What does that tell you?
- They can win.

684
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:13,007
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

685
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,718
I know, I've been coming here
since the '20s.

686
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,847
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

687
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:22,766
The trucks were owned by your father.

688
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:25,853
Michael.

689
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,779
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

690
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,201
The two million
never got to the island.

691
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,753
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money

692
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,172
because you worried about the rebels.

693
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:03,265
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

694
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,777
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

695
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:21,450
What I wouldn't give
for 20 more years.

696
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:25,704
Here we are, protected.

697
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,332
Free to make our profits
without Kefauver,

698
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:31,377
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

699
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,464
Ninety miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

700
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:40,344
Ninety miles. It's nothing.

701
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:47,267
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

702
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:49,728
and having the cash
to make it possible.

703
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,147
Michael,

704
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,360
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

705
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,431
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

706
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:31,520
- Hi! Freddy Corleone.
- Mio frati.

707
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,566
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

708
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,944
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

709
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:43,490
Can you imagine that?
$2 million on the seat next to me.

710
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,164
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

711
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,084
You want to count it?

712
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,092
What's going on?
I'm totally in the dark.

713
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:04,386
The family is making
an investment in Havana.

714
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,513
This is a gift for the President.

715
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:11,060
That's great! Havana's great.

716
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,064
It's my kind of town.

717
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:20,861
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

718
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,617
No. I've never met them.

719
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:34,041
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

720
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:42,549
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

721
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:46,303
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

722
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,848
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

723
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,437
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did.

724
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,980
Like Kay.

725
01:27:58,232 --> 01:28:01,068
Have kids. Have a family.

726
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:09,493
For once in my life, be more like Pop.

727
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,707
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

728
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,878
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."

729
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:22,506
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

730
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,676
Sometimes I think it's true.

731
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,720
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

732
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:33,934
Mikey, I was mad at you.

733
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:44,361
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

734
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:47,656
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

735
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,579
Por favor...

736
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:58,500
- How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
- Banana Daiquiri.

737
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:00,878
- That's it?
- That's it.

738
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,130
Uno Banana Daiquiri

739
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:06,300
and a club soda.

740
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:16,977
Senator Geary flies in
from Washington tomorrow

741
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,479
with some government people.

742
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:21,607
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

743
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:29,031
- That's my specialty, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

744
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:31,575
Of course, Mike.

745
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:38,373
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace

746
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,000
to bring in the New Year.

747
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:46,089
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.

748
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:48,425
For my protection.

749
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:52,930
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

750
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,825
- Who?
- Roth.

751
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:22,542
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

752
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:26,421
It was Roth all along.

753
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:30,050
He acts like I'm his son,
his successor.

754
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:34,805
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

755
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,103
How can I help?

756
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,523
Just go along, as if you know nothing.

757
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:47,526
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

758
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:51,113
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

759
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:12,426
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

760
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,928
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.

761
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:17,264
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.

762
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,727
- Gracias, señor.
- Buenas noches.

763
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:27,399
- Honey, go to the casino.
- If you're feeling better.

764
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,318
Feel fine.

765
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:35,157
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

766
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:42,497
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

767
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:51,590
- You're pulling out?
- Just want to... Just want to wait.

768
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:58,180
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

769
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:02,434
I'd give four million to be able
to take a painless piss.

770
01:32:03,352 --> 01:32:08,231
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

771
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:12,194
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

772
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,404
I know I didn't.

773
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:26,666
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

774
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,337
Sort of looked up to me, you know.

775
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,548
We did our first work together.

776
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:38,303
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

777
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:44,393
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

778
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,145
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

779
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,441
As much as anyone,

780
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,986
I loved him and trusted him.

781
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:03,829
Later on he had an idea
to build a city

782
01:33:03,954 --> 01:33:07,499
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I.s going to the West Coast.

783
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:12,587
That kid's name was Moe Greene

784
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:16,716
and the city he invented
was Las Vegas.

785
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:20,220
This was a great man.

786
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:23,223
A man of vision and guts.

787
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:26,768
And there isn't even
a plaque, signpost

788
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:29,563
or statue of him in that town.

789
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:35,277
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

790
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,822
No one knows who gave the order.

791
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,451
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

792
01:33:43,285 --> 01:33:47,956
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

793
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:50,750
So when he turned up dead,

794
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,296
I let it go.

795
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:59,301
And I said to myself,

796
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:03,054
"This is the business we've chosen."

797
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,223
I didn't ask

798
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:11,188
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

799
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:24,493
That two million in a bag
in your room...

800
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,748
I'm going in to take a nap.

801
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:34,503
When I wake, if the money
is on the table,

802
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,338
I know I have a partner.

803
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:39,424
If it isn't, I know I don't.

804
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:39,067
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

805
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:42,612
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

806
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:44,239
Senator Payton from Florida.

807
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:47,492
Judge DeMalco from New York.

808
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:50,495
Senator Ream from Maryland.

809
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:53,665
Fred Corngold from UTT.

810
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:58,545
- That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
- He does?

811
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:01,047
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

812
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,966
You might try
some of the local drinks.

813
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,802
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

814
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:09,764
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

815
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:12,809
- That you got! Con gusto...
- Johnny!

816
01:36:13,852 --> 01:36:17,439
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

817
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:21,026
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

818
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:24,571
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

819
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,781
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

820
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,743
- Feliz Año Nuevo!
- Happy New Year.

821
01:36:41,338 --> 01:36:45,508
- Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
- Everybody stands.

822
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:48,219
It's worth it. You won't believe this.

823
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:50,263
I don't believe it already.

824
01:36:50,347 --> 01:36:53,475
- 50 dollars, right?
- You've got a bet, mister.

825
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:03,068
That's Superman.

826
01:37:37,102 --> 01:37:39,062
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

827
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:43,900
- I don't believe it!
- It's got to be fake.

828
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:46,569
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.

829
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:51,241
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

830
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,410
Johnny Ola brought me here.

831
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:56,204
I didn't believe it,
but seeing is believing!

832
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:59,666
- I see it, but still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

833
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:03,461
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

834
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,758
- Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
- I want to see him break a brick!

835
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:34,552
Relax, we're taking you
to the hospital.

836
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:26,145
...and you'll continue to get those.

837
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:27,814
I don't believe that

838
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:30,900
President Eisenhower
would ever pull out of Cuba

839
01:40:30,984 --> 01:40:34,445
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

840
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:41,327
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

841
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:44,330
Fredo! Where are you going?

842
01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:48,001
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

843
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:47,185
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

844
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:50,897
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

845
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,650
I think a half hour ought to do it.

846
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:56,277
Just long enough
to bring in the New Year.

847
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:16,047
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

848
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:34,751
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

849
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,670
Don't make a big thing about it.

850
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:44,927
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

851
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,222
You broke my heart!

852
01:44:28,513 --> 01:44:33,893
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

853
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:36,270
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

854
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:42,944
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

855
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:46,864
And I shall leave
the city immediately.

856
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:54,122
I wish all of you good luck.

857
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:04,423
Salud!

858
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:09,178
Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!

859
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,368
Fredo!

860
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:37,039
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

861
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:39,584
Roth is dead.

862
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:44,589
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

863
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,383
Fredo!

864
01:46:11,908 --> 01:46:14,118
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

865
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:47,652
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

866
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:31,112
Al. Get me a wet towel.

867
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:39,870
Does Kay know I'm back?

868
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:48,004
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

869
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:51,632
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

870
01:47:51,716 --> 01:47:53,968
It was a little car
with an electric motor

871
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:56,262
that he can ride in. It's nice.

872
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,183
Thank you, Al.

873
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:05,271
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

874
01:48:23,164 --> 01:48:24,874
Where's my brother?

875
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:29,003
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

876
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:31,964
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.

877
01:48:32,048 --> 01:48:33,799
Your bodyguard is dead.

878
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:35,718
I asked about Fredo.

879
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:40,222
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

880
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,393
All right.

881
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:48,564
I want you to get in touch with him.

882
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:51,484
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

883
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,070
Tell him I know Roth misled him.

884
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:56,989
That he didn't know
they would try to kill me.

885
01:48:57,907 --> 01:49:02,244
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

886
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:04,622
What?

887
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,005
What? Come on.

888
01:49:15,424 --> 01:49:17,593
Kay had a miscarriage.

889
01:49:30,648 --> 01:49:33,192
- Was it a boy?
- At three-and-a-half months...

890
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:37,446
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?

891
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:42,159
I really don't know.

892
01:49:58,008 --> 01:50:01,011
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

893
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:50,186
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

894
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:54,273
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

895
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,817
You know I've got three daughters.

896
01:50:57,443 --> 01:50:59,028
This is my neighborhood.

897
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:03,282
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

898
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:08,120
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

899
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:14,084
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

900
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:17,630
Give me $200 each,
for your own protection.

901
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,298
And I'll forget the insult.

902
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,637
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

903
01:51:27,056 --> 01:51:29,558
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

904
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,520
And your family will be ruined.

905
01:51:33,771 --> 01:51:38,901
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

906
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:43,739
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

907
01:51:43,948 --> 01:51:45,741
Now don't refuse me.

908
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,578
Understand, paisan?

909
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,503
I understand.

910
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:04,593
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

911
01:52:05,844 --> 01:52:10,266
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

912
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:16,897
Don't be afraid to tell them!

913
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:20,859
600 bucks...

914
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,571
Suppose we don't pay?

915
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:28,075
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

916
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:32,288
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

917
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:35,833
He's got connections
with the cops, too.

918
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:36,917
We have to pay him.

919
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:39,336
$200 each... everybody agreed?

920
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:45,384
Why do we have to pay him?

921
01:52:45,884 --> 01:52:48,220
Vito, leave this to us.

922
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:52,349
He's one person, we're three.

923
01:52:52,725 --> 01:52:55,311
He's got guns, we've got guns.

924
01:52:55,728 --> 01:52:59,148
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

925
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,734
This is his neighborhood!

926
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:07,781
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

927
01:53:08,407 --> 01:53:09,825
Who?

928
01:53:10,242 --> 01:53:14,246
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

929
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:15,748
They don't pay Fanucci.

930
01:53:17,458 --> 01:53:22,338
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

931
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:27,843
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

932
01:53:43,275 --> 01:53:46,028
Now what I say stays in this room.

933
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:51,116
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

934
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:57,706
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

935
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,670
If Fanucci says $200...

936
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:04,046
...he means it, Vito!

937
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:07,549
I'll reason with him.

938
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:11,720
Leave everything to me.

939
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:14,348
I'll take care of everything.

940
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:18,686
I never lie to my friends.

941
01:54:19,478 --> 01:54:22,314
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

942
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:24,525
He'll ask for the money.

943
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:31,448
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants.
Don't argue with him.

944
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:34,702
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

945
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:39,665
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

946
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:42,876
How can you get him to take less?

947
01:54:43,377 --> 01:54:45,546
That's my business.

948
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:49,550
Just remember that I did you a favor.

949
01:54:53,345 --> 01:54:55,013
Is it a deal?

950
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,683
Yes.

951
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:48,025
His family's out of the house.

952
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:50,611
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

953
01:55:55,491 --> 01:55:59,119
Vito, here's my $50. Buona fortuna.

954
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:12,841
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

955
01:56:16,178 --> 01:56:20,599
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

956
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:58,220
It looks like there's -
$ 100 under my hat.

957
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,276
I was right.

958
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:15,571
Only $ 100...

959
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:21,076
I'm short of money right now.

960
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:27,666
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

961
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,794
You understand, don't you?

962
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:41,597
You've got balls, young man!

963
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:46,602
How come I never heard
of you before?

964
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:55,527
You've got a lot of guts.

965
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:02,451
I'll find you some work
for good money.

966
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:18,258
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

967
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:23,263
You've done well for yourself.

968
01:58:27,184 --> 01:58:29,311
Enjoy the festa!

969
02:00:38,607 --> 02:00:41,026
This is too violent for me!

970
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,419
What've you got there?

971
02:05:42,786 --> 02:05:46,664
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

972
02:09:12,203 --> 02:09:16,040
Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,

973
02:09:16,124 --> 02:09:19,460
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

974
02:09:19,752 --> 02:09:21,462
That's right.

975
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:26,426
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization.

976
02:09:29,596 --> 02:09:33,433
No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.

977
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:36,102
What was your position?

978
02:09:37,145 --> 02:09:39,897
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

979
02:09:40,356 --> 02:09:43,484
- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.

980
02:09:43,568 --> 02:09:45,820
No, I don't know. Tell me.

981
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:50,116
When the boss says
"push a button" on a guy,

982
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:52,994
I push a button. See, Senator?

983
02:09:53,077 --> 02:09:54,245
Mr. Questadt.

984
02:09:55,038 --> 02:09:57,248
- You mean you kill people?
- What?

985
02:09:57,373 --> 02:10:02,503
You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.

986
02:10:06,215 --> 02:10:07,467
Yeah, that's right.

987
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:13,097
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

988
02:10:13,222 --> 02:10:16,434
Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone.

989
02:10:16,517 --> 02:10:20,313
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

990
02:10:21,064 --> 02:10:23,107
No, I never talked to him.

991
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:27,195
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?

992
02:10:27,278 --> 02:10:30,698
- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?

993
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:32,825
I'm particularly interested
in knowing,

994
02:10:32,909 --> 02:10:36,621
was there always a buffer involved?

995
02:10:36,704 --> 02:10:41,125
Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.

996
02:10:41,250 --> 02:10:45,755
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!

997
02:10:47,632 --> 02:10:51,844
You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.

998
02:11:19,872 --> 02:11:22,125
Tell me something, Ma.

999
02:11:26,254 --> 02:11:29,841
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

1000
02:11:36,597 --> 02:11:38,391
He was being strong...

1001
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:46,524
Strong for his family.

1002
02:11:56,284 --> 02:11:58,870
But by being strong for his family...

1003
02:12:00,496 --> 02:12:02,290
...could he...

1004
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:05,585
...lose it?

1005
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:12,884
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

1006
02:12:14,802 --> 02:12:17,889
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

1007
02:12:19,766 --> 02:12:23,394
No, I meant... lose his family.

1008
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:29,358
But you can never lose your family.

1009
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:40,745
Times are changing.

1010
02:13:03,017 --> 02:13:05,812
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

1011
02:13:06,562 --> 02:13:08,189
Take it as a gift.

1012
02:13:11,067 --> 02:13:15,279
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

1013
02:13:32,129 --> 02:13:34,924
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

1014
02:13:37,885 --> 02:13:41,305
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

1015
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,102
She's in bad trouble.

1016
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:50,565
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

1017
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:54,318
He told her to get rid of the animal.

1018
02:13:56,112 --> 02:14:00,074
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

1019
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:04,453
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

1020
02:14:07,456 --> 02:14:10,251
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

1021
02:14:11,085 --> 02:14:12,670
I'm so ashamed!

1022
02:14:13,129 --> 02:14:17,466
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

1023
02:14:20,261 --> 02:14:21,971
I'm sorry, but...

1024
02:14:23,973 --> 02:14:27,310
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

1025
02:14:28,102 --> 02:14:29,687
I can't move!

1026
02:14:31,147 --> 02:14:33,065
I want you to talk to him!

1027
02:14:33,524 --> 02:14:36,110
Tell him I want to stay here!

1028
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:45,578
What's your landlord's name?

1029
02:14:46,162 --> 02:14:48,205
His name is Signor Roberto.

1030
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:51,000
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

1031
02:14:51,751 --> 02:14:54,670
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

1032
02:14:55,755 --> 02:14:57,173
A real pig-sty?

1033
02:15:16,317 --> 02:15:17,902
My name is Vito Corleone.

1034
02:15:17,985 --> 02:15:20,279
Signora Colombo
is a friend of my wife.

1035
02:15:21,155 --> 02:15:24,533
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

1036
02:15:25,201 --> 02:15:29,288
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

1037
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:33,626
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

1038
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:37,630
I already rented the place
to another family.

1039
02:15:43,094 --> 02:15:47,848
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

1040
02:15:49,183 --> 02:15:53,020
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

1041
02:15:53,437 --> 02:15:55,398
So let her stay.

1042
02:15:55,523 --> 02:15:57,233
Impossible.

1043
02:15:58,067 --> 02:15:59,235
Are you Sicilian?

1044
02:15:59,777 --> 02:16:01,362
No, I'm Calabrese.

1045
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:05,324
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.

1046
02:16:06,033 --> 02:16:08,619
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

1047
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,998
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

1048
02:16:12,415 --> 02:16:14,959
How much more a month?

1049
02:16:16,085 --> 02:16:17,211
Five bucks.

1050
02:16:22,049 --> 02:16:25,094
Here's six months increase in advance.

1051
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:29,056
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

1052
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:32,101
Come see me in another six months.

1053
02:16:33,436 --> 02:16:36,439
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

1054
02:16:37,231 --> 02:16:38,607
The dog stays.

1055
02:16:43,070 --> 02:16:46,240
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

1056
02:16:46,699 --> 02:16:50,786
Watch out or I'll kick your
Sicilian ass right into the street!

1057
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:55,041
Do me this favor.

1058
02:16:55,875 --> 02:16:58,002
I won't forget it.

1059
02:16:58,794 --> 02:17:02,131
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

1060
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:05,885
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

1061
02:17:12,683 --> 02:17:14,602
What a character!

1062
02:17:22,485 --> 02:17:27,448
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

1063
02:17:35,164 --> 02:17:38,292
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

1064
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:49,345
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1065
02:17:50,262 --> 02:17:52,515
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1066
02:17:54,475 --> 02:17:56,519
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1067
02:17:57,937 --> 02:18:00,856
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1068
02:18:07,113 --> 02:18:09,949
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1069
02:18:11,659 --> 02:18:17,331
Un, due, three, four,
five, six, tutt'!

1070
02:18:18,374 --> 02:18:23,129
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1071
02:18:31,637 --> 02:18:33,305
Can I sit down?

1072
02:18:36,308 --> 02:18:39,311
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1073
02:18:40,354 --> 02:18:43,357
The rent stays like before!

1074
02:18:53,117 --> 02:18:54,451
I'll even lower it.

1075
02:18:57,496 --> 02:18:58,581
I'll lower it $5.

1076
02:19:03,002 --> 02:19:04,461
I'll lower it $ 10!

1077
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:13,137
Can I offer you some coffee?

1078
02:19:15,347 --> 02:19:20,144
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1079
02:19:25,357 --> 02:19:27,985
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1080
02:19:33,407 --> 02:19:35,367
I wish I could stay longer!

1081
02:19:41,332 --> 02:19:43,792
Just call me and I'll be here!

1082
02:19:54,845 --> 02:19:57,806
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1083
02:20:13,447 --> 02:20:18,077
- Vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1084
02:20:25,292 --> 02:20:27,628
- New York City.
- Would you speak up, please?

1085
02:20:29,088 --> 02:20:30,673
New York City.

1086
02:20:30,798 --> 02:20:34,009
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

1087
02:20:34,426 --> 02:20:38,097
- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

1088
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:43,936
Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?

1089
02:20:44,979 --> 02:20:48,107
Godfather is a term
used by his friends.

1090
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:50,901
One of affection and respect.

1091
02:20:51,735 --> 02:20:55,823
Mr. Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.

1092
02:20:56,573 --> 02:21:01,662
For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.

1093
02:21:01,745 --> 02:21:03,789
I've come to know them well.

1094
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:09,044
They have honored me with
their support and their friendship.

1095
02:21:09,128 --> 02:21:10,296
I can proudly say that

1096
02:21:10,379 --> 02:21:14,216
some of my very best friends
are Italian-Americans.

1097
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:20,389
However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings

1098
02:21:20,472 --> 02:21:22,057
in order to preside over

1099
02:21:22,141 --> 02:21:24,768
a very important meeting
of my own committee.

1100
02:21:25,811 --> 02:21:28,105
Before I leave, I do want to say this,

1101
02:21:28,981 --> 02:21:33,402
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever

1102
02:21:33,485 --> 02:21:35,654
a slur upon the great Italian people.

1103
02:21:35,738 --> 02:21:38,991
I can state from my own knowledge
and experience

1104
02:21:39,074 --> 02:21:44,413
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,

1105
02:21:44,496 --> 02:21:48,125
patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.

1106
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:53,714
It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples

1107
02:21:53,797 --> 02:21:56,425
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel.

1108
02:21:56,508 --> 02:21:59,219
Because from the time
of Christopher Columbus

1109
02:21:59,303 --> 02:22:04,141
to the time of Enrico Fermi
to the present day,

1110
02:22:04,224 --> 02:22:08,520
Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.

1111
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:10,898
They are the salt of the earth,

1112
02:22:10,981 --> 02:22:13,442
and one of the backbones
of this country.

1113
02:22:20,491 --> 02:22:24,286
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

1114
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:28,248
Mr. Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.

1115
02:22:28,791 --> 02:22:34,380
We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.

1116
02:22:35,339 --> 02:22:36,673
He stated that you are head

1117
02:22:36,757 --> 02:22:39,051
of the most powerful Mafia family
in the country.

1118
02:22:39,718 --> 02:22:42,096
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

1119
02:22:42,179 --> 02:22:45,641
He testified that you are
personally responsible

1120
02:22:45,724 --> 02:22:49,478
for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947

1121
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:53,232
and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.

1122
02:22:53,315 --> 02:22:55,609
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

1123
02:22:55,984 --> 02:22:59,071
Is it true that in the year 1950

1124
02:22:59,154 --> 02:23:04,493
you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five Families" in New York

1125
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:08,372
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?

1126
02:23:08,497 --> 02:23:11,750
- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr. Questadt.

1127
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:13,710
Is it true you have
a controlling interest

1128
02:23:13,794 --> 02:23:16,255
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

1129
02:23:17,464 --> 02:23:18,465
No, it's not true.

1130
02:23:18,549 --> 02:23:21,218
I own some stock in
some of the hotels there,

1131
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:22,803
but very little.

1132
02:23:25,305 --> 02:23:29,601
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

1133
02:23:29,685 --> 02:23:36,650
Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?

1134
02:23:37,192 --> 02:23:38,610
No, I do not.

1135
02:23:38,735 --> 02:23:41,905
Senator, my client
would like to read a statement.

1136
02:23:41,989 --> 02:23:47,995
Mr. Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.

1137
02:23:48,203 --> 02:23:54,001
Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.

1138
02:23:54,084 --> 02:23:59,756
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!

1139
02:24:01,884 --> 02:24:04,928
No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone
to read his statement.

1140
02:24:05,012 --> 02:24:06,680
I'll put it in the record.

1141
02:24:08,682 --> 02:24:11,685
In the hopes of clearing
my family name

1142
02:24:11,768 --> 02:24:15,814
to give my children their share
of the American way of life

1143
02:24:15,898 --> 02:24:18,942
without a blemish on their name
and background,

1144
02:24:19,026 --> 02:24:23,739
I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.

1145
02:24:25,699 --> 02:24:28,410
I consider it
a great personal dishonor

1146
02:24:28,494 --> 02:24:30,787
to have to deny that I am a criminal.

1147
02:24:32,247 --> 02:24:34,875
I wish to have the following noted
for the record...

1148
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:39,880
That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two

1149
02:24:39,963 --> 02:24:44,301
and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defense of my country.

1150
02:24:46,053 --> 02:24:50,265
That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.

1151
02:24:50,349 --> 02:24:54,645
That no proof linking me
to any criminal conspiracy

1152
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:59,233
whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name

1153
02:24:59,316 --> 02:25:00,692
has ever been made public.

1154
02:25:01,735 --> 02:25:04,655
I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,

1155
02:25:04,738 --> 02:25:06,573
although it's my right to do so.

1156
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:15,040
I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me

1157
02:25:15,624 --> 02:25:18,043
and if they do not,

1158
02:25:18,126 --> 02:25:21,630
I hope they will have the decency
to clear my name

1159
02:25:21,713 --> 02:25:25,092
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.

1160
02:25:26,677 --> 02:25:29,763
I'm sure we're impressed.

1161
02:25:29,846 --> 02:25:32,391
Particularly with
your love for our country.

1162
02:25:32,474 --> 02:25:35,435
We'll be in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday

1163
02:25:35,519 --> 02:25:37,271
when we will produce a witness

1164
02:25:37,354 --> 02:25:40,107
who'll corroborate
the charges against you.

1165
02:25:40,190 --> 02:25:45,237
At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.

1166
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:49,658
I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!

1167
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:56,707
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1168
02:25:56,832 --> 02:26:00,460
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!

1169
02:26:01,461 --> 02:26:05,090
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1170
02:26:07,384 --> 02:26:10,596
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

1171
02:26:10,679 --> 02:26:12,931
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1172
02:26:13,015 --> 02:26:16,184
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1173
02:26:17,561 --> 02:26:19,688
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1174
02:26:20,856 --> 02:26:24,901
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1175
02:26:24,985 --> 02:26:29,865
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1176
02:26:31,491 --> 02:26:34,703
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1177
02:26:36,121 --> 02:26:39,916
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1178
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,794
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1179
02:26:42,878 --> 02:26:48,133
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1180
02:26:48,216 --> 02:26:51,261
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.

1181
02:26:51,345 --> 02:26:54,056
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1182
02:26:54,139 --> 02:26:55,932
Some deal!

1183
02:26:59,144 --> 02:27:02,648
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1184
02:27:04,650 --> 02:27:09,780
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1185
02:27:10,906 --> 02:27:13,367
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers

1186
02:27:13,492 --> 02:27:15,535
they tried to kill him.

1187
02:27:15,619 --> 02:27:17,412
He thought you double-crossed him.

1188
02:27:18,872 --> 02:27:22,167
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared,

1189
02:27:22,292 --> 02:27:25,003
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1190
02:27:25,087 --> 02:27:29,508
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1191
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:36,932
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24-hour guards.

1192
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:42,020
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1193
02:27:44,356 --> 02:27:47,609
What about Fredo? What does he know?

1194
02:27:47,734 --> 02:27:50,278
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1195
02:27:51,321 --> 02:27:55,158
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1196
02:28:02,999 --> 02:28:05,293
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1197
02:28:44,833 --> 02:28:47,169
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1198
02:28:49,171 --> 02:28:51,882
We have time.

1199
02:28:51,965 --> 02:28:54,509
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1200
02:28:56,428 --> 02:28:58,680
I didn't know all that much.

1201
02:28:59,514 --> 02:29:04,186
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1202
02:29:04,895 --> 02:29:06,772
Anything you can tell me now?

1203
02:29:09,107 --> 02:29:11,610
They've got Pentangeli.

1204
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:30,170
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.

1205
02:29:30,253 --> 02:29:32,464
I swear to God I didn't know.

1206
02:29:35,509 --> 02:29:39,930
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1207
02:29:41,723 --> 02:29:44,059
He said that he wanted to talk.

1208
02:29:46,269 --> 02:29:52,484
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1209
02:29:55,153 --> 02:29:59,324
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1210
02:29:59,449 --> 02:30:03,119
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1211
02:30:03,203 --> 02:30:07,249
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1212
02:30:09,334 --> 02:30:11,670
it would be good for the family.

1213
02:30:13,213 --> 02:30:17,300
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1214
02:30:18,051 --> 02:30:21,763
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1215
02:30:22,264 --> 02:30:26,393
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?

1216
02:30:27,686 --> 02:30:30,438
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1217
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:35,694
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1218
02:30:36,695 --> 02:30:40,907
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1219
02:30:41,449 --> 02:30:45,871
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1220
02:30:45,954 --> 02:30:48,790
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"

1221
02:30:49,291 --> 02:30:52,377
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1222
02:30:52,586 --> 02:30:56,298
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

1223
02:30:57,007 --> 02:31:01,970
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1224
02:31:02,053 --> 02:31:05,891
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1225
02:31:13,815 --> 02:31:16,943
Is there anything you can tell me
about this investigation?

1226
02:31:17,027 --> 02:31:18,653
Anything more?

1227
02:31:26,912 --> 02:31:32,792
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1228
02:31:42,594 --> 02:31:44,346
Fredo,

1229
02:31:46,765 --> 02:31:49,309
you're nothing to me now.

1230
02:31:51,269 --> 02:31:53,605
Not a brother, not a friend.

1231
02:31:55,482 --> 02:31:58,401
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1232
02:31:59,653 --> 02:32:01,655
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1233
02:32:02,822 --> 02:32:04,950
I don't want you near my house.

1234
02:32:07,285 --> 02:32:08,954
When you see our mother,

1235
02:32:09,037 --> 02:32:11,790
I want to know in advance,
so I won't be there.

1236
02:32:13,625 --> 02:32:15,210
You understand?

1237
02:32:24,928 --> 02:32:26,888
Mikey.

1238
02:32:33,603 --> 02:32:36,815
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1239
02:33:27,282 --> 02:33:29,826
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1240
02:33:31,119 --> 02:33:34,164
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1241
02:33:54,517 --> 02:33:57,228
This committee will come to order!

1242
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:02,734
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

1243
02:34:02,817 --> 02:34:06,488
- Where were you born?
- Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.

1244
02:34:06,571 --> 02:34:08,615
Where do you live now?

1245
02:34:08,948 --> 02:34:12,994
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

1246
02:34:15,246 --> 02:34:19,626
We have here a witness
that will further testify

1247
02:34:19,751 --> 02:34:21,586
to Michael Corleone's rule

1248
02:34:21,669 --> 02:34:26,132
of a criminal empire
that controls all gambling.

1249
02:34:26,341 --> 02:34:31,221
This witness has had no buffer
between himself and Michael Corleone.

1250
02:34:31,304 --> 02:34:34,557
He can corroborate enough charges

1251
02:34:34,641 --> 02:34:39,229
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.

1252
02:34:39,437 --> 02:34:41,439
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1253
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:44,150
Mr. Pentangeli.

1254
02:34:45,568 --> 02:34:51,282
Mr. Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1255
02:34:51,366 --> 02:34:56,162
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,

1256
02:34:56,246 --> 02:35:00,959
and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?

1257
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:09,384
I never knew any Godfather.

1258
02:35:12,053 --> 02:35:14,097
I have my own family.

1259
02:35:17,475 --> 02:35:20,145
Mr. Pentangeli, you...

1260
02:35:20,228 --> 02:35:24,357
You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.

1261
02:35:24,816 --> 02:35:28,027
I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...

1262
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:32,866
Were you at any time a member
of a crime organization

1263
02:35:32,991 --> 02:35:34,826
led by Michael Corleone?

1264
02:35:34,909 --> 02:35:37,912
I don't know nothing about that!

1265
02:35:40,915 --> 02:35:44,919
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1266
02:35:45,044 --> 02:35:47,463
but that was a long time ago.

1267
02:35:48,631 --> 02:35:51,718
We have a sworn affidavit.

1268
02:35:53,303 --> 02:35:54,804
Your sworn affidavit,

1269
02:35:54,888 --> 02:35:57,724
that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.

1270
02:35:58,016 --> 02:35:59,934
Do you deny this confession,

1271
02:36:00,018 --> 02:36:02,729
and do you realize
what will happen if you do?

1272
02:36:02,854 --> 02:36:06,065
The FBI guys promised me a deal

1273
02:36:06,149 --> 02:36:11,821
so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.

1274
02:36:11,905 --> 02:36:15,950
But it was all lies. Everything!

1275
02:36:16,618 --> 02:36:18,995
They kept saying,

1276
02:36:19,078 --> 02:36:24,250
"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".

1277
02:36:25,418 --> 02:36:29,422
So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"

1278
02:36:29,631 --> 02:36:32,508
Mr. Corleone,
would you kindly identify

1279
02:36:32,592 --> 02:36:35,428
the gentleman sitting to your left?

1280
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:37,931
I can answer that.

1281
02:36:38,473 --> 02:36:40,683
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1282
02:36:41,684 --> 02:36:45,939
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

1283
02:36:46,522 --> 02:36:51,069
- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.

1284
02:36:51,277 --> 02:36:54,322
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1285
02:36:55,114 --> 02:36:58,743
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1286
02:36:58,868 --> 02:37:02,664
- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.

1287
02:37:02,747 --> 02:37:07,460
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.

1288
02:37:07,543 --> 02:37:09,754
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

1289
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:14,467
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1290
02:37:15,093 --> 02:37:18,846
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1291
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:50,253
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1292
02:37:51,129 --> 02:37:53,298
The children are outside. We're going.

1293
02:37:55,883 --> 02:37:58,428
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1294
02:37:59,387 --> 02:38:00,388
Rocco?

1295
02:38:02,890 --> 02:38:05,518
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1296
02:38:08,313 --> 02:38:10,606
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1297
02:38:11,232 --> 02:38:14,068
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1298
02:38:17,905 --> 02:38:20,283
I'm very happy for you.

1299
02:38:20,366 --> 02:38:24,996
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1300
02:38:26,497 --> 02:38:30,418
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

1301
02:38:31,294 --> 02:38:33,921
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1302
02:38:35,131 --> 02:38:40,345
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1303
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:43,389
I think it's too late
for changes, Michael.

1304
02:38:44,682 --> 02:38:49,187
- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, "too late"?

1305
02:38:54,734 --> 02:38:57,320
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1306
02:39:03,368 --> 02:39:07,497
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1307
02:39:08,539 --> 02:39:10,583
Where is he now?

1308
02:39:11,751 --> 02:39:14,295
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1309
02:39:15,171 --> 02:39:17,507
All he had to do was show his face.

1310
02:39:19,384 --> 02:39:23,763
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1311
02:39:31,896 --> 02:39:35,900
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1312
02:39:36,984 --> 02:39:40,988
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1313
02:39:41,864 --> 02:39:46,035
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1314
02:39:46,119 --> 02:39:50,039
Things between men and women
will not change.

1315
02:39:50,123 --> 02:39:54,210
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1316
02:39:54,293 --> 02:39:59,465
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1317
02:39:59,549 --> 02:40:02,677
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1318
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:06,681
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

1319
02:40:08,224 --> 02:40:09,934
Over!

1320
02:40:22,363 --> 02:40:25,825
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1321
02:40:26,993 --> 02:40:32,165
I never thought
that would ever happen, but it has.

1322
02:40:46,429 --> 02:40:48,097
Kay...

1323
02:40:51,309 --> 02:40:53,311
We're leaving tomorrow.

1324
02:40:54,187 --> 02:40:57,398
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1325
02:40:57,482 --> 02:41:03,237
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1326
02:41:03,613 --> 02:41:09,744
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1327
02:41:10,828 --> 02:41:16,000
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1328
02:41:16,083 --> 02:41:20,129
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1329
02:41:21,047 --> 02:41:23,341
Don't you know that?

1330
02:41:25,092 --> 02:41:26,802
Kay...

1331
02:41:29,847 --> 02:41:34,560
In time, you'll feel differently.

1332
02:41:36,062 --> 02:41:38,898
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1333
02:41:40,858 --> 02:41:42,860
I know that.

1334
02:41:44,862 --> 02:41:47,990
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1335
02:41:50,243 --> 02:41:51,285
Yes.

1336
02:41:52,537 --> 02:41:55,164
I know what that meant to you.

1337
02:41:57,333 --> 02:41:59,502
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1338
02:42:00,336 --> 02:42:03,172
I swear
I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1339
02:42:04,507 --> 02:42:06,467
I'm going to change.

1340
02:42:07,718 --> 02:42:11,973
I'll change. I've learnt that I have
the strength to change.

1341
02:42:14,183 --> 02:42:17,144
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1342
02:42:17,979 --> 02:42:22,775
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1343
02:42:24,277 --> 02:42:28,489
- We'll go on.
- Michael!

1344
02:42:29,615 --> 02:42:31,576
Michael, you are blind.

1345
02:42:33,536 --> 02:42:35,580
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1346
02:42:37,957 --> 02:42:39,667
It was an abortion.

1347
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:46,716
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1348
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:50,803
Something that's unholy and evil!

1349
02:42:52,471 --> 02:42:54,765
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1350
02:42:55,766 --> 02:42:59,854
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1351
02:43:01,564 --> 02:43:04,066
It was an abortion, Michael.

1352
02:43:04,191 --> 02:43:09,780
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1353
02:43:11,490 --> 02:43:15,578
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.

1354
02:43:16,829 --> 02:43:22,293
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1355
02:43:22,376 --> 02:43:27,048
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1356
02:43:34,889 --> 02:43:37,808
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1357
02:43:37,892 --> 02:43:41,979
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1358
02:45:08,858 --> 02:45:12,528
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1359
02:47:27,246 --> 02:47:28,622
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1360
02:47:33,127 --> 02:47:36,213
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1361
02:47:36,630 --> 02:47:39,425
My partner in America, in New York.

1362
02:47:40,009 --> 02:47:41,802
His name is Vito Corleone.

1363
02:47:42,678 --> 02:47:45,097
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1364
02:47:45,890 --> 02:47:47,433
To his company in America.

1365
02:47:52,146 --> 02:47:55,524
They're olive oil importers,
Don Ciccio.

1366
02:48:05,159 --> 02:48:10,205
We'd like your blessing,
and your permission to start work.

1367
02:48:11,832 --> 02:48:14,960
Where is this young man
from New York?

1368
02:48:18,130 --> 02:48:21,550
Have him come closer.

1369
02:48:22,301 --> 02:48:25,137
I can't see him so good.

1370
02:48:32,144 --> 02:48:35,981
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1371
02:48:38,317 --> 02:48:39,944
Bless you!

1372
02:48:42,446 --> 02:48:43,822
What's your name?

1373
02:48:49,036 --> 02:48:51,997
You took the name of this town!

1374
02:48:52,706 --> 02:48:54,333
And what's your father's name?

1375
02:48:54,416 --> 02:48:58,128
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

1376
02:48:58,712 --> 02:49:02,174
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1377
02:49:05,719 --> 02:49:09,014
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1378
02:49:09,139 --> 02:49:12,017
...and this is for you!

1379
02:50:33,891 --> 02:50:36,018
Michael, say goodbye.

1380
02:51:39,706 --> 02:51:40,707
Hi, Al.

1381
02:51:53,095 --> 02:51:55,597
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1382
02:52:04,106 --> 02:52:05,732
Tom, where's Mike?

1383
02:52:06,984 --> 02:52:08,861
Waiting for you to leave.

1384
02:52:11,738 --> 02:52:16,118
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1385
02:52:16,660 --> 02:52:20,038
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1386
02:52:33,135 --> 02:52:35,596
Michael, it's Connie.

1387
02:52:56,909 --> 02:52:58,368
Michael...

1388
02:53:01,413 --> 02:53:04,166
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1389
02:53:13,425 --> 02:53:14,551
Is Kay coming?

1390
02:53:18,305 --> 02:53:19,890
No.

1391
02:53:27,606 --> 02:53:30,275
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1392
02:53:30,943 --> 02:53:34,655
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1393
02:53:38,408 --> 02:53:40,244
That's right.

1394
02:53:43,163 --> 02:53:45,958
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1395
02:53:50,170 --> 02:53:52,422
Please, I want to talk to you.

1396
02:54:03,934 --> 02:54:07,604
Michael, I hated you
for so many years.

1397
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:13,860
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1398
02:54:17,155 --> 02:54:19,283
that I could hurt you.

1399
02:54:25,414 --> 02:54:29,584
You were just being strong
for all of us, the way Papa was.

1400
02:54:30,377 --> 02:54:32,212
And I forgive you.

1401
02:54:36,800 --> 02:54:38,760
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1402
02:54:39,803 --> 02:54:43,849
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1403
02:54:50,772 --> 02:54:54,568
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1404
02:55:04,369 --> 02:55:06,038
Connie.

1405
02:56:48,306 --> 02:56:50,434
Tom, sit down.

1406
02:57:02,487 --> 02:57:05,907
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1407
02:57:07,576 --> 02:57:11,329
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in Israel.

1408
02:57:12,873 --> 02:57:17,461
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1409
02:57:17,544 --> 02:57:21,339
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1410
02:57:21,423 --> 02:57:23,800
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1411
02:57:24,468 --> 02:57:27,554
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1412
02:57:29,347 --> 02:57:33,351
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1413
02:57:33,435 --> 02:57:35,520
Panama won't take him.

1414
02:57:35,604 --> 02:57:37,772
Not for a million,
not for ten million.

1415
02:57:38,356 --> 02:57:42,277
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1416
02:57:43,361 --> 02:57:46,364
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1417
02:57:46,573 --> 02:57:48,283
That plane goes to Miami.

1418
02:57:48,366 --> 02:57:50,535
That's right.
That's where I want it met.

1419
02:57:51,745 --> 02:57:53,163
Impossible.

1420
02:57:53,246 --> 02:57:57,167
They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1421
02:57:57,375 --> 02:58:00,420
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1422
02:58:00,545 --> 02:58:02,130
It would be
like trying to kill the President.

1423
02:58:02,214 --> 02:58:06,092
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

1424
02:58:09,596 --> 02:58:13,141
If anything in this life is certain,

1425
02:58:13,225 --> 02:58:16,478
if history has taught us anything,

1426
02:58:16,603 --> 02:58:18,438
it's that you can kill anyone.

1427
02:58:24,486 --> 02:58:28,865
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1428
02:58:29,699 --> 02:58:31,451
Good.

1429
02:58:33,787 --> 02:58:37,457
Why did you ask me
if something was wrong when I came in?

1430
02:58:41,169 --> 02:58:43,046
I thought you were going to tell me

1431
02:58:43,129 --> 02:58:47,008
that you were moving your family
to Vegas

1432
02:58:48,468 --> 02:58:49,803
and that you'd been offered

1433
02:58:49,886 --> 02:58:52,305
the Vice Presidency
of the Houstan hotels there.

1434
02:58:54,474 --> 02:58:55,809
I thought you'd tell me that.

1435
02:58:55,892 --> 02:58:58,478
Must I tell you every offer
I turn down?

1436
02:59:03,525 --> 02:59:06,278
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1437
02:59:08,113 --> 02:59:10,782
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1438
02:59:12,409 --> 02:59:14,119
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1439
02:59:14,202 --> 02:59:16,496
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1440
02:59:17,497 --> 02:59:22,419
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1441
02:59:22,502 --> 02:59:26,006
I don't feel I have to
wipe everybody out, Tom.

1442
02:59:26,089 --> 02:59:27,882
Just my enemies, that's all.

1443
02:59:35,515 --> 02:59:38,393
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1444
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:42,772
Because if not,
you can take your wife,

1445
02:59:42,856 --> 02:59:45,358
your family and your mistress

1446
02:59:46,067 --> 02:59:48,445
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1447
02:59:52,324 --> 02:59:55,910
Why do you hurt me, Michael?
I've always been loyal to you.

1448
02:59:55,994 --> 02:59:57,370
What is this?

1449
03:00:01,875 --> 03:00:03,710
So... you're staying?

1450
03:00:05,754 --> 03:00:07,922
Yes, I'm staying.

1451
03:00:10,634 --> 03:00:12,552
What do you want me to do?

1452
03:00:13,178 --> 03:00:15,221
Hey, Anthony.

1453
03:00:15,597 --> 03:00:20,435
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1454
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:22,896
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1455
03:00:23,104 --> 03:00:25,607
You know, when I was your age,

1456
03:00:26,232 --> 03:00:28,234
I went out fishing

1457
03:00:28,318 --> 03:00:33,114
with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1458
03:00:34,324 --> 03:00:37,369
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1459
03:00:38,745 --> 03:00:42,290
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1460
03:00:44,542 --> 03:00:48,254
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1461
03:00:48,338 --> 03:00:51,966
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1462
03:00:54,552 --> 03:00:58,014
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1463
03:01:00,809 --> 03:01:02,644
Do you want to try it out on the lake?

1464
03:01:02,727 --> 03:01:04,270
Okay.

1465
03:01:06,356 --> 03:01:07,565
What else have you got?

1466
03:01:34,175 --> 03:01:36,761
Everything will be okay.

1467
03:01:36,845 --> 03:01:40,056
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1468
03:01:40,974 --> 03:01:45,854
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1469
03:01:46,896 --> 03:01:50,358
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1470
03:01:50,442 --> 03:01:55,447
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1471
03:01:55,530 --> 03:01:58,616
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1472
03:02:04,748 --> 03:02:06,666
Tom,

1473
03:02:07,292 --> 03:02:09,377
what do I do now?

1474
03:02:10,670 --> 03:02:12,672
Frankie.

1475
03:02:17,093 --> 03:02:20,680
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1476
03:02:22,724 --> 03:02:26,186
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1477
03:02:26,269 --> 03:02:29,814
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1478
03:02:32,484 --> 03:02:34,986
You were around the old-timers,

1479
03:02:35,069 --> 03:02:38,239
who built the organization
of the families,

1480
03:02:38,323 --> 03:02:40,116
basing them on the old Roman legions,

1481
03:02:40,200 --> 03:02:43,870
with "regimes," "capos"
and "soldiers".

1482
03:02:44,913 --> 03:02:48,958
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1483
03:02:49,918 --> 03:02:53,463
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1484
03:02:53,546 --> 03:02:56,716
We was like the Roman Empire.

1485
03:02:56,800 --> 03:03:00,136
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1486
03:03:02,597 --> 03:03:04,682
Yeah,

1487
03:03:04,766 --> 03:03:06,976
it was once.

1488
03:03:11,523 --> 03:03:12,941
Frankie.

1489
03:03:23,535 --> 03:03:26,955
When a plot
against the Emperor failed,

1490
03:03:28,289 --> 03:03:31,835
the plotters were always
given a chance

1491
03:03:33,795 --> 03:03:37,298
to let their families
keep their fortunes. Right?

1492
03:03:37,382 --> 03:03:39,592
Only the rich guys.

1493
03:03:39,717 --> 03:03:41,761
The little guys got knocked off

1494
03:03:41,845 --> 03:03:44,764
and all their estates
went to the Emperors.

1495
03:03:44,848 --> 03:03:47,934
Unless they went home
and killed themselves,

1496
03:03:48,017 --> 03:03:49,894
then nothing happened.

1497
03:03:51,104 --> 03:03:55,441
And their families were taken care of.

1498
03:03:57,360 --> 03:04:00,196
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1499
03:04:01,030 --> 03:04:02,657
Yeah.

1500
03:04:03,533 --> 03:04:05,660
They went home

1501
03:04:06,870 --> 03:04:09,747
and sat in a hot bath

1502
03:04:09,831 --> 03:04:12,458
opened up their veins

1503
03:04:12,667 --> 03:04:15,336
and bled to death.

1504
03:04:16,546 --> 03:04:20,758
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1505
03:04:25,972 --> 03:04:29,684
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1506
03:04:29,893 --> 03:04:33,062
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1507
03:04:51,623 --> 03:04:54,792
- See you, Tom.
- Addio, Frankie.

1508
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:08,306
Kay. You have to go.

1509
03:05:10,600 --> 03:05:13,519
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1510
03:05:22,779 --> 03:05:26,574
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1511
03:05:29,035 --> 03:05:31,871
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1512
03:05:31,955 --> 03:05:36,459
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1513
03:05:38,252 --> 03:05:40,338
Kay, please.

1514
03:05:43,633 --> 03:05:45,301
All right.

1515
03:05:58,898 --> 03:06:01,109
Mary, come here.

1516
03:06:08,408 --> 03:06:09,826
Anthony.

1517
03:06:09,909 --> 03:06:12,537
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1518
03:07:52,095 --> 03:07:53,805
Easy.

1519
03:08:00,061 --> 03:08:03,022
Anthony! Anthony!

1520
03:08:03,106 --> 03:08:06,150
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1521
03:08:06,317 --> 03:08:09,028
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1522
03:08:09,695 --> 03:08:11,572
Shit!

1523
03:08:13,074 --> 03:08:15,910
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1524
03:08:17,411 --> 03:08:21,374
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1525
03:08:25,169 --> 03:08:26,629
Hey, Anthony.

1526
03:08:26,754 --> 03:08:30,550
Listen, I'll catch one for you
in secret.

1527
03:08:34,470 --> 03:08:36,347
Let's go.

1528
03:09:15,636 --> 03:09:18,222
Mr. Roth, I must take you
into custody.

1529
03:09:18,306 --> 03:09:19,932
I understand.

1530
03:09:20,016 --> 03:09:23,102
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1531
03:09:23,186 --> 03:09:26,022
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1532
03:09:26,105 --> 03:09:31,235
I went to Israel to live there
as a Jew, in the twilight of my life.

1533
03:09:37,408 --> 03:09:40,369
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1534
03:09:49,128 --> 03:09:50,796
Frankie!

1535
03:10:06,896 --> 03:10:09,732
Is it true you're worth
over $300 million?

1536
03:10:09,815 --> 03:10:13,486
I'm a retired investor
living on a pension.

1537
03:10:13,694 --> 03:10:17,240
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1538
03:10:17,323 --> 03:10:20,868
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1539
03:10:33,297 --> 03:10:35,049
Jesus Christ.

1540
03:10:36,592 --> 03:10:41,389
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1541
03:10:42,765 --> 03:10:45,268
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1542
03:10:46,227 --> 03:10:49,397
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1543
03:10:50,398 --> 03:10:54,694
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1544
03:11:37,778 --> 03:11:41,490
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1545
03:11:42,533 --> 03:11:45,286
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1546
03:11:45,369 --> 03:11:50,374
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1547
03:11:50,458 --> 03:11:53,586
This cute little thing
is my sister Connie.

1548
03:11:53,669 --> 03:11:56,547
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1549
03:11:56,630 --> 03:11:58,174
Yes.

1550
03:11:58,257 --> 03:12:02,345
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1551
03:12:02,970 --> 03:12:06,766
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1552
03:12:06,974 --> 03:12:09,268
Hey, Mr. Einstein...

1553
03:12:12,438 --> 03:12:15,191
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

1554
03:12:15,274 --> 03:12:17,443
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1555
03:12:18,027 --> 03:12:21,322
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

1556
03:12:21,405 --> 03:12:23,866
Let's see that thing.

1557
03:12:25,493 --> 03:12:27,411
That's nice!

1558
03:12:27,495 --> 03:12:30,998
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1559
03:12:32,458 --> 03:12:35,628
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1560
03:12:40,633 --> 03:12:44,011
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1561
03:12:44,220 --> 03:12:45,846
He's not ugly...

1562
03:12:52,436 --> 03:12:55,731
What do you think
of the nerve of those Japs?

1563
03:12:55,815 --> 03:12:58,442
Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1564
03:12:58,526 --> 03:13:00,361
They didn't know
it was Pop's birthday.

1565
03:13:02,238 --> 03:13:04,907
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1566
03:13:04,990 --> 03:13:09,495
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1567
03:13:09,578 --> 03:13:13,249
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1568
03:13:13,332 --> 03:13:16,961
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

1569
03:13:18,003 --> 03:13:19,922
You talk to Carlo.

1570
03:13:21,882 --> 03:13:25,302
Only saps risk their lives
for strangers.

1571
03:13:25,386 --> 03:13:28,973
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

1572
03:13:29,056 --> 03:13:30,850
They risk their lives
for their country.

1573
03:13:30,933 --> 03:13:32,643
Country isn't your blood.

1574
03:13:32,726 --> 03:13:38,566
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

1575
03:13:38,649 --> 03:13:40,151
I did.

1576
03:13:41,360 --> 03:13:43,028
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1577
03:13:46,657 --> 03:13:49,910
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1578
03:13:49,994 --> 03:13:54,331
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1579
03:13:54,999 --> 03:13:56,625
I didn't want it.

1580
03:13:58,335 --> 03:14:00,838
Come on! Knock it off!

1581
03:14:00,921 --> 03:14:04,675
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

1582
03:14:07,470 --> 03:14:10,681
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1583
03:14:14,226 --> 03:14:16,479
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1584
03:14:27,198 --> 03:14:28,699
Nice.

1585
03:14:30,409 --> 03:14:32,119
Nice.

1586
03:14:32,786 --> 03:14:35,414
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1587
03:14:36,540 --> 03:14:39,543
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1588
03:14:39,627 --> 03:14:41,545
Don't encourage him!

1589
03:14:41,629 --> 03:14:44,340
Get me a drink. Go on!

1590
03:14:48,344 --> 03:14:51,847
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1591
03:14:51,931 --> 03:14:56,143
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1592
03:14:57,937 --> 03:14:59,897
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1593
03:15:03,025 --> 03:15:07,154
- My future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1594
03:15:07,571 --> 03:15:12,993
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

1595
03:15:13,077 --> 03:15:14,995
He's here!

1596
03:15:16,872 --> 03:15:18,499
Come on.

1597
03:15:21,168 --> 03:15:22,753
Stupid!

1598
03:15:40,437 --> 03:15:42,648
Surprise!

1599
03:15:45,734 --> 03:15:51,574
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1600
03:15:51,699 --> 03:15:55,452
That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...
