00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,993
Hey! My purse!
He's got my purse!

3
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,660
- Hey, stop him!
- Come on.

4
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,664
Somebody stop him!
He's got my purse!

5
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:30,900
Police! Freeze!

6
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:36,538
Hey! Stop! Out of my way!

7
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,707
Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Police!

8
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,741
Move!

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,716
You did not
just go down there...

10
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,422
What the fuck?

11
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,598
Fuck sakes.

12
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,667
Get your fucking hands
in the air!

13
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:43,205
I ain't gonna
say it again, motherfucker!

14
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:52,048
Fuck.

15
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,073
<i>Hello,
Detective Bozwick.</i>

16
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,975
- <i>I want to play a game.</i>
- No!

17
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:55,945
<i>The 3 train is arriving
in two minutes.</i>

18
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,913
<i>It is up to you to decide</i>

19
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,316
<i>if this will be
your final stop.</i>

20
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,219
<i>You have taken
the witness stand many times,</i>

21
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:06,255
<i>and railroaded innocent people
with your lies,</i>

22
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,958
<i>putting them away in jail.</i>

23
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:12,028
<i>Today, it is you
who will be railroaded.</i>

24
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,797
<i>You have one chance to live.</i>

25
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,599
<i>Tear from your mouth the tongue
that has so often been used</i>

26
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,301
<i>to lie and to deceive.</i>

27
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:22,338
<i>Take a leap of faith,
and you will live.</i>

28
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,140
<i>Only your weight will rip away</i>

29
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,308
<i>your lying tongue and save you.</i>

30
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,778
<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

31
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,091
<i>What you talking about?
That movie won awards.</i>

32
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,659
<i>You know, Tom Hanks
is a straight pimp, man,</i>

33
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,195
<i>but I don't know if you could
make that movie today.</i>

34
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,897
What the fuck
you going on about?

35
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,233
- Special needs abuse.
- Special needs?

36
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,968
- What, you woke now?
- Not woke,

37
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,736
but you can't say "handicapped,"
you can't say "retarded."

38
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,206
You got to say "special needs,"
I'm trying to be respectful.

39
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,376
Forrest Gump
was special needs, man.

40
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,844
What was the name of the girl?

41
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,246
- Jenny.
- Jenny.

42
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,814
He did everything for Jenny.

43
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,083
This motherfucker did some shit.

44
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,919
He jogged across
the whole country.

45
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:19,321
He beat China in ping-pong.

46
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,357
You know how fucking hard
that shit is?

47
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,958
He was a war hero.

48
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:25,394
Who the fuck is nicer
than Forrest Gump?

49
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,163
His best friend

50
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:31,367
was a nigga and a white boy
with no legs.

51
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,336
He made a billion dollars
selling shrimp.

52
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,905
And she still wouldn't fuck him.

53
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,973
Hey, eventually,
they got together.

54
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:41,477
Yeah, after she got AIDS.

55
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,446
As soon as she got AIDS,
she's like, "Hey, Forrest..."

56
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,149
Get the fuck out of here, man.

57
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:49,185
Giving that guy AIDS?

58
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,953
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:52,421
- That shit's abusive.
- But he ain't get it.

60
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,225
I ain't see no sequel.
Where's <i>Gump 2?</i>

61
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,860
Yo, Rico just got off
the elevator.

62
00:06:57,893 --> 00:06:59,261
Oh, shit.

63
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,164
Let's do this.

64
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,777
Get down! Get down right now!

65
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,412
Get down right now!
You know what this is!

66
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:17,913
You know what this is!

67
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,381
That's right! Put it all!
Come on! Down!

68
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:20,950
Fill up this bag! Put it
in the motherfucking bag!

69
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,151
Come on.

70
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,153
- You know what to do!
- Chill!

71
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:26,155
Get back!

72
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,524
I want that coke!
I want that money!

73
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:31,260
I want everything!

74
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,131
Shit.

75
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,467
Ninety seconds,
we gotta go!

76
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:23,445
Freeze! Police!

77
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,247
Hands up! Get your hands up!

78
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,916
Get out of the car.
Get the fuck out of...

79
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,586
Zeke? Is that you?

80
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,054
Zeke?

81
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:34,823
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

82
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,191
You do an undercover op...

83
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,060
You don't clear it,
there's no coordination.

84
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,828
We are Homicide,

85
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,864
but you're robbing drug dealers
in a fucking hotel.

86
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,066
I had a dozen 911 calls come in.

87
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,901
What if someone got killed?

88
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,936
That crew killed four people
last week, and we got them.

89
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,973
And we could have got more of
them if my cover wasn't blown.

90
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,008
Fuck your cover, Zeke!

91
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:57,446
You were off on your own,
as usual, no backup, nothing.

92
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,382
No backup, 'cause there's
nobody on the force

93
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,918
I can fucking trust!

94
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:06,121
From now on, you're going
to learn to be a team player.

95
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:08,290
You're getting a partner.
Jeannie, send Schenk in.

96
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:11,260
Do I look like
a fucking Jamaican nanny?

97
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:15,030
Do I smell like jerk sauce
and baby wipes? No!

98
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,232
Me no want no partner!

99
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,201
I'm not
babysitting some fucking rook.

100
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:21,270
Yes, you are.

101
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,173
Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks

102
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,541
doesn't mean
you get out of the shit.

103
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,242
Stop making this
about my father, okay?

104
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,211
He's gone, you're the head
of the department now.

105
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:30,579
Yeah. Drama queen.

106
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,647
Zeke, it's been 12 years.

107
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,583
Yes! Twelve fucking years.

108
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,986
Twelve years ago,
I turned in a dirty cop,

109
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,456
I get a medal for it.
Big fucking deal!

110
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,291
I also got a bullet,

111
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,160
and I got to look over my back
for the rest of my career.

112
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:46,929
Shut up!

113
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,330
It is too fucking hot in here

114
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,199
for me to listen
to this bullshit.

115
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:51,600
I got a heat wave going on.

116
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,035
We got rolling blackouts,

117
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:55,504
the city is nuts. Stop!

118
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:56,972
You wanted to see me, Captain?

119
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,240
Yeah, come in.

120
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,009
Zeke, I want you to meet

121
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:02,945
Detective in training,
William Schenk.

122
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,048
He was the top of his academy,
so don't screw this up.

123
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:09,051
Zeke is going to break you in,
show you the ropes.

124
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:11,687
Detective Banks, it's good to...

125
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,922
Yup...

126
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,024
- Go.
- Okay.

127
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,426
<i>Officer Harris, 1-0-3.</i>

128
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,994
<i>Officer Harris, 1-0-3.</i>

129
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,078
<i>Sergeant Jones, front desk.</i>

130
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:39,081
<i>Sergeant Jones, front desk.</i>

131
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:43,452
So, uh... How do you take
your coffee in the morning?

132
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:44,553
Alone.

133
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:47,689
Okay.

134
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:55,063
Hey, man, I get it.

135
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:58,033
I wouldn't want to be stuck
with some random kid either.

136
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,068
You don't want to be my partner.

137
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,137
You don't know that.

138
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,274
Your dad's the reason
for all of this.

139
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,176
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

140
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,011
And I'm not him.

141
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,381
Prepare to be underwhelmed.

142
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:14,416
Banks and Schenk...

143
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,386
Some homeless guy got hit
by the 3 train. You're up.

144
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:21,523
<i>Detective Peterson,</i>

145
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,392
<i>pick up 2-2-1.
Detective Peterson, 2-2-1.</i>

146
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,334
This is you?

147
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,672
Beats the squad car.

148
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:41,643
Detective Banks
en route to that 10-19.

149
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,679
Would that be north
or south side of the street?

150
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,748
- <i>Northbound.</i>
- Copy that.

151
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,116
What are you doing?

152
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:50,419
Oh, it's just family.

153
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:53,322
This is my wife, Emma,
this is my son, Charlie.

154
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:55,424
They're cute.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

155
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:57,159
"While it lasts"?

156
00:11:57,192 --> 00:12:01,363
Nothing happier than the wife
of a new detective,

157
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:02,664
and nothing more angry

158
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,100
than that same bitch
10 years later.

159
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,602
Maybe it's 'cause
you call them bitches.

160
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,337
I'm half-Italian, trust me.

161
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,072
Women do not like it
when you call them bitches...

162
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,074
What are you telling me
about women,

163
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,042
young motherfucker? Shit.

164
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:16,245
I just said it to you,
I didn't say it to a woman.

165
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,047
I don't say it to their face.
It's not like I'm Too Short.

166
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,350
We just met, but, you know,
you're firing already, and I appreciate it.

167
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:22,718
I mean, all I'm saying is,
you know,

168
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,220
most crime happens
on weekends, holidays,

169
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:27,389
so you would think
anybody married to a cop

170
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:29,191
would understand this.

171
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:30,492
But no.

172
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,528
One day, your wife will be angry

173
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,430
'cause you couldn't go to
her sister's birthday dinner.

174
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,567
You can give a woman
600 Tuesdays.

175
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,702
It ain't worth
three Saturday nights.

176
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:51,346
So, uh... I'm guessing
you're divorced.

177
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,717
Divorced, no, not yet.
I'm going through a divorce.

178
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,687
That's even worse.
It's kind of like chemo.

179
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,656
Shit. Sorry.

180
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:04,560
Sorry for what? We're cops.
This is the life we choose.

181
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:07,296
Highest divorce rate,
highest suicide rate.

182
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,232
Highest rate
of domestic violence.

183
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:12,334
Yo, when you decided
to become a cop,

184
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,503
you pretty much assured yourself

185
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,305
you were gonna die alone.

186
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:21,376
My wife and I,
we're doing this counseling.

187
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,746
She's got me, uh, working on,
like, communication.

188
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:27,382
Counseling?
Yeah, that's nice.

189
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,518
Yeah, my wife
fucked the counselor.

190
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,820
Fuck, really?

191
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,454
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

192
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:35,190
Women cheat, too.

193
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:40,295
It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.

194
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,165
Women cheat, too,
but here's what happens.

195
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,168
Women cheat in the daytime.

196
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,237
You can get away with
a lot of shit in the daytime.

197
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:50,606
That's right. You can ride

198
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,542
- a lot of dick before dusk.
- Mmm-hmm.

199
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,815
Shit, man, I just found out
Pilates doesn't even exist.

200
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,149
Wait, seriously?

201
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,518
Emma loves Pilates.

202
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,387
I'm sure she does.
I'm sure she does.

203
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,356
But don't worry about it.

204
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,193
You're gonna be fine.
You gonna be married forever.

205
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:17,165
What do we got?

206
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,367
See for yourself.

207
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:21,904
Watch yourself.

208
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,447
Ugh.

209
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,917
If you're gonna throw up,
don't do it on the evidence.

210
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,552
Are you kidding me?

211
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:38,821
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

212
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,390
Ugh.

213
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,260
You see a lot of TV sets
on the subway?

214
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:48,397
You get everything
down here.

215
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,669
Damn. Wow.

216
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:57,739
Ugh.

217
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,180
This bum's
gonna be tough to ID.

218
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,483
I'm not too sure this is a bum.

219
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,622
I don't know a lot of bums
trying to get their steps in.

220
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:17,459
Whoever this is, is married...

221
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,396
and wears a Fitbit.

222
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,490
This package just came in.

223
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:49,926
- For me?
- Yeah.

224
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,336
What is that?

225
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:06,943
"Play me."

226
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,351
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

227
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,655
Don't want to fuck up
my computer.

228
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,694
<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

229
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:28,630
<i>I'm here to help reform
the Metro Police,</i>

230
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:32,367
<i>to remind them of their oath
to the people of this city.</i>

231
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,938
<i>One officer from your station
refused to be reformed.</i>

232
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:38,808
<i>He will not be the last
to play my game.</i>

233
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,978
If that spiral
is what I think it is...

234
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:43,612
Jigsaw?

235
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,081
Wait, I thought
the Jigsaw killer was dead?

236
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:46,916
Yeah, but if it's
another copycat...

237
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,683
It's gonna be a shit show.

238
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,787
I recognize that building.

239
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,054
It's the courthouse.

240
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,289
Let's check it out.

241
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,012
What are you guys
doing here?

242
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:17,579
Well, we thought you boys
might need some backup.

243
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,648
Fuck you, Fitch,
it's not your case.

244
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:21,984
Yo, Zeke.

245
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,760
What do we got here?

246
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:43,906
What the fuck is that?

247
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,474
Is that a fucking tongue?

248
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,581
Fucking shit.

249
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,624
4-5-3... Who's 4-5-3?

250
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,865
Circle up!

251
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,101
Okay, here's what we know.

252
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,036
Dental records confirm it's Boz.

253
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:17,006
Sorry, guys.

254
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,709
But, look, we got to catch the
son of a bitch that did this.

255
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:22,711
Train conductor says
he didn't see much.

256
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:24,046
Says he saw
Boz hanging in the air

257
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,815
right before
he hit the windshield.

258
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:27,984
Says he thinks he saw Boz
bleeding from the mouth badly.

259
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,418
The package was sent
from a delivery service

260
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:32,889
that picked it up
on a stoop on Anglin Drive.

261
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,489
What about the spirals?

262
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:36,058
Hey, Cap, obviously
it's a Jigsaw copycat,

263
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:38,160
so that's where we got to
concentrate our focus.

264
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:40,629
Sure, Fitch, but I want you
to stick with hard evidence.

265
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,199
Kraus, contact the Feds,
get anything they got.

266
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:45,835
Files, old videos, anything.

267
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,435
Do we have street images?

268
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:48,838
We're working on it,
but Digital Forensics was

269
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,605
able to map Boz's movement
off the Fitbit.

270
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:52,707
Last place it was registered
was Stuart's Point,

271
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,911
time-stamped
during the fireworks.

272
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:56,913
Someone needs to call Kara,
his wife, let her know.

273
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,014
Yeah, I already called her.

274
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,184
You called Kara?

275
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:04,020
Yeah.

276
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,022
- Do you know Kara?
- No.

277
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,858
Did you actually talk to her,
or did you text her?

278
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:11,593
Let me guess,
you sent an emoji.

279
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,162
Do they have
a dead husband emoji?

280
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,931
I talked to her, asshole.

281
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:18,667
Hey. We had to notify her
before it leaked to the press.

282
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,835
Okay, O'Brien's got point...

283
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:20,870
O'Brien?

284
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,240
This is mine.

285
00:19:24,273 --> 00:19:26,675
Me and the rook
were first on scene.

286
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,611
Banks...

287
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:32,514
I'm sorry, isn't this protocol?

288
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,050
Now you're part of
the team again, Zeke?

289
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,755
Fuck you.

290
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,158
No, fuck you.

291
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:43,893
Come on, Zeke.

292
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:47,029
When all you motherfuckers
were treating me like shit,

293
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:50,498
shooting me in my fucking back,

294
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:52,767
Boz was my friend!

295
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,638
Boz played with my kid.

296
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:58,473
We went to fucking games.

297
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,112
Fuck me? No, fuck you.

298
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:07,283
Fucking assholes...

299
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:11,153
Zeke! Zeke, fucking stop!

300
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,558
In here! Now!

301
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,798
Zip up! Get out.

302
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay, Captain.

303
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:32,141
Damn, nigga, wash your hands.

304
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:34,210
I get why you want this.

305
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:37,113
Boz was my friend, too,
but you can't do this alone.

306
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,949
I need the whole department
on this, working together.

307
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,051
I'm not trying
to do this alone, okay?

308
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:46,055
Boz is my family, man.
You gotta let me take lead.

309
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,694
You gotta let me catch
this motherfucker.

310
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:00,602
All right, guys,
we got a change of plans.

311
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:03,873
Banks is taking lead.

312
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:07,043
Listen up.

313
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,744
I know some of you guys
think I'm a rat.

314
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,815
Some of you think I'm a snitch.

315
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,953
Some of you are mad
I fucked your mother.

316
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:23,225
Boz was last seen

317
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:26,095
at the July 4th parade
at Stuart's Point...

318
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,332
...so there should be plenty
of surveillance footage,

319
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:32,802
so check your hashtags,
Instagram...

320
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,669
Hey!

321
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:37,873
Now, we got a dead cop here,
guys, who was brutally killed.

322
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:41,077
A fallen brother
whose tongue was ripped out.

323
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,813
We need to focus on the case
and solve this.

324
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,915
So get the footage
to Detective Banks

325
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:47,749
and put your
personal shit aside.

326
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,786
O'Brien, you good?

327
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,054
No problem here, Captain.

328
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:53,823
Good.

329
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,892
Let's go.

330
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:06,035
Yo, where we going?

331
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:08,170
Pay our respects. Put on a suit.

332
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:28,357
Zeke...

333
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,192
Kara...

334
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,161
It's okay.

335
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:34,696
Whoever did this,
I'm gonna find them.

336
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,399
I don't understand...
How did it happen?

337
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,701
Kara,
your mother's on the phone.

338
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:40,803
Yeah, okay.

339
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:42,238
Zeke.

340
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:44,140
Lisa.

341
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:49,677
You okay? I, uh... I texted you.

342
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:50,846
Yeah, I got it.

343
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:53,715
Is Brian here?

344
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,384
No, my sister's watching him.

345
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:59,121
Your sister... So, Rhonda gets
to see my son, but I don't?

346
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,158
Are we really gonna
do this here?

347
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:07,296
No. Not today.

348
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:08,464
- Hey, I'm William.
- Stop.

349
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:09,697
Zeke's partner, yup...

350
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,209
I'll wait outside.
I'll wait outside.

351
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:22,278
Jamie's at the neighbor's.

352
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:25,713
I don't know how I'm supposed to
tell him what happened to his dad.

353
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:28,450
I can't imagine what
you're going through right now.

354
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,822
I know this is a bad time,

355
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:36,825
but I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

356
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:40,462
In the last few weeks,

357
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:43,399
did you notice anything unusual?

358
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:48,003
I mean, did Boz say anything,
or act stressed out?

359
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:51,307
He was a cop, Zeke.

360
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,175
So nothing out of the ordinary?

361
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:55,144
No.

362
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:57,413
There was one thing,
there was a black SUV

363
00:23:57,446 --> 00:23:59,714
parked outside
one night last week.

364
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:02,084
You get a make?

365
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:04,954
- Range Rover, Escalade, Lincoln?
- I don't know.

366
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,755
I told Boz about it
and he went out,

367
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,792
and he walked up,
and, I don't know,

368
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:12,161
the next thing I know, he was
yelling at somebody inside.

369
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:13,963
Any idea
what they were yelling about?

370
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,397
Did you hear anything?

371
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:18,801
No. If I see it again,
I'll get a license plate.

372
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,470
If you don't mind,
could you get me his devices?

373
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:25,074
I need to look
at his iPad, laptop.

374
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,176
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Kara.

375
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:34,183
Nice... I gotta go, guys.
All right, be safe.

376
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:38,954
Zeke.

377
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:42,057
He knew you were a good cop.

378
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:43,492
You find out who did this.

379
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,373
You pull a gun on your old man?

380
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,608
You out of your fucking mind?

381
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:34,209
I could have killed you.

382
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:35,911
What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

383
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:38,247
I could have killed you.

384
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,581
How'd you get in here?

385
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:41,517
Did you forget
who the landlord is?

386
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,985
Yeah, but that doesn't
give you the right

387
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,920
to just walk in here
anytime you want.

388
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:46,488
Renters got rights.

389
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:48,023
You start paying some rent,
you can get some rights.

390
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:54,396
Heard about Boz. You all right?

391
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:58,133
No, Dad, I'm... I'm fucked up.

392
00:25:59,902 --> 00:26:02,004
Sorry to hear that.
I know how close you were.

393
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:09,511
Jigsaw copycat.
That could be difficult.

394
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:11,046
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

395
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,514
Just, you know,
being lead detective,

396
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:14,249
a lot of responsibility.

397
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,151
You got a problem with that?

398
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:18,320
Or are you just scared
I'm gonna embarrass you?

399
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:20,155
See? That right there.

400
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,359
This ain't about you.

401
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:25,928
You always making shit
about you.

402
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,996
That's the shit
that ruined your career

403
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,465
and your marriage.

404
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:31,533
So, now you're giving
fatherly advice?

405
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,435
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?

406
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:36,939
Dad. We live
in the same building.

407
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,074
I saw you out front
the other day,

408
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:42,111
you nodded at me like we were the
only two black guys in the mall.

409
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,513
We haven't had a meal together
in over a year.

410
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:47,049
Haven't had a meal?

411
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,384
What? Are you hungry, nigga?

412
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,119
You want to go get
a fucking slice?

413
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:52,554
Let me tell you something.

414
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:57,926
My father went to work,
came home. That was it.

415
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,329
All right, I'm gonna
get out of here, son.

416
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,664
I'm gonna go to Kara's,
pay my respects.

417
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,968
You're gonna be all right.

418
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,637
Come over tonight, I'll order some
food, we'll go over the case.

419
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,085
Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks...

420
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:25,120
Stop making this about my father.
Twelve years ago,

421
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:27,356
I turned in a dirty cop.

422
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,725
Pete! Pete!

423
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:31,126
What happened? What happened?

424
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,594
He pulled a gun on me.

425
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,598
The witness pulled a gun on you?

426
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:40,569
Because there's nobody on the force
I can fucking trust!

427
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:04,092
I've been staring at this shit
for five hours.

428
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:06,028
I don't even look at porn
that long.

429
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:16,071
Okay, I'm out. What's next?

430
00:28:16,104 --> 00:28:18,240
Well, why don't you check
with Digital Forensics

431
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:22,044
and see if anybody in Boz's
phone log has a black SUV?

432
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,645
My phone is dead,
you got a charger?

433
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,347
Your phone's dead,
what are you, a little girl?

434
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,748
Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

435
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,016
Okay.

436
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,518
Thank you.

437
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:32,154
Don't drain my battery
watching <i>Twilight.</i>

438
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,728
Glad to see you joined us.

439
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,030
You think this is linked
to John Kramer?

440
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:45,501
I sent some pictures to the
Feds, we'll see what happens.

441
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:47,636
How are we doing
on surveillance?

442
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:50,539
Please tell me the $20 million the
city spent on cameras got us something?

443
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:51,573
Drury?

444
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:56,678
Yeah... Street cameras
from here to here

445
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:58,480
have already been
scrubbed through.

446
00:28:58,514 --> 00:29:00,649
Facial recognition came up
with nothing.

447
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:03,552
There were two cameras
broken on this corner.

448
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,654
<i>Fitch and Kraus are there now
to canvas it.</i>

449
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,803
No. Closed. Closed.

450
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,209
There's Boz.

451
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:04,112
Who's that he's chasing?

452
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:05,782
I know that guy.

453
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:08,885
Benny Wrights. He's a hustler.

454
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:10,586
Serious tweaker.

455
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:13,322
Flops in a burnt-out
bread factory down on 12th.

456
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,224
Deals with a pusher,
street name Speez.

457
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:18,760
- Should we tell Zeke?
- Fuck him.

458
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:21,296
I'll take the building,
you track down Speez.

459
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,768
Hey, boss, let me see
that gun over there.

460
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:29,338
The one on the left.
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

461
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,712
On behalf of the Metro Police,

462
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,547
I want to thank you
for your generosity.

463
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,356
I got shit to do. I'm out.

464
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:49,691
What's his deal?

465
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,526
He's a crooked piece of shit.

466
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,831
- Let's just call it a night.
- You sure?

467
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:56,431
Yeah. Go home.

468
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:58,333
Go see your wife,
go see your kid.

469
00:30:58,367 --> 00:30:59,401
What's your boy's name?

470
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:00,903
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

471
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:02,371
All right, I'll put him down
and come right back.

472
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:03,906
No, no, no,
I'm not going to be here.

473
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,741
Meeting my dad for dinner,
gonna go over the case.

474
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:06,775
Okay.

475
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:09,912
Hey, William.

476
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:11,146
Yeah?

477
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:13,883
Good work today.

478
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:17,954
Thanks, man.

479
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,688
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

480
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:47,884
Benny?

481
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:01,964
Wake up, Benny.

482
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:12,875
Rise and shine, my man.

483
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:18,513
Benny, come on. Get up.

484
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,350
Come on, Benny, get up.

485
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:26,956
You all right?

486
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,396
Fuck me.

487
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:55,717
<i>This is Deborah
Kraus, leave me a message.</i>

488
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:56,919
Kraus, call me.

489
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,592
<i>Lieutenant Tim O'Brien here,</i>

490
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,827
<i>leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

491
00:33:34,991 --> 00:33:37,526
Help! Help me!

492
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:02,684
<i>Hello, Detective Fitch.</i>

493
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,387
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

494
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:14,729
- <i>Hey, Zeke.</i>
- William.

495
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,498
<i>What are you doing up?</i>

496
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:17,766
<i>I told you to take
the rest of the night off.</i>

497
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,701
Uh, it's fine,
Charlie's sleeping.

498
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,770
Was sleeping.

499
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,940
Just waiting for Emma to get
home, she's having a girl's night.

500
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:27,076
Girl's night out. Okay.

501
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,677
You better be careful with that,

502
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,445
might be a dick night out.

503
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:32,480
Just because
you're getting a divorce,

504
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:34,382
it doesn't mean that everyone
else's marriages have to end, too.

505
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,652
Sounds like
you got your hands full.

506
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:38,753
You want to call me back?

507
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:40,589
<i>Nah, it's okay,</i>

508
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:42,091
<i>we're sleep-training.
It's a fucking nightmare.</i>

509
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:44,160
Look, man, um... I know
you and Boz were close,

510
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:45,962
<i>I don't know
how to tell you this.</i>

511
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:48,697
You got something to say,
William, say it.

512
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,067
Well, I'm looking through all
the Metro records like you asked,

513
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,936
and Boz was accused of lying on
the stand more than anybody...

514
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:57,439
by like a wide fucking margin.

515
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,540
<i>Jesus.</i>

516
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,810
The courthouse...

517
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,047
That's why the tongue
was at the courthouse.

518
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:11,187
Can I help you?

519
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,721
Are you Marcus Banks?

520
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:14,857
- No, I'm his son.
- Well, Terroni delivery.

521
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:16,058
Oh, okay.

522
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:23,165
Dad!

523
00:35:49,158 --> 00:35:51,027
Pop, got your food.

524
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,779
Motherfucker!

525
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:12,081
How the fuck
could you not call me first?

526
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,816
I tried, but you didn't answer.

527
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:16,685
Well, why didn't you wait for me
to fucking call you back?

528
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,720
'Cause you would have
talked me out of it.

529
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:19,989
I told the truth.

530
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:21,756
Get the fuck
out of my face, Zeke.

531
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,159
Can we get the room?

532
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:28,230
God damn it.

533
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:32,667
I knew I should have never
let him become a cop.

534
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:38,240
This shit's gonna go
sideways fast.

535
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:40,575
He turned in a dirty cop.
Pete was a scumbag.

536
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:41,911
Press will make him out
to be a hero.

537
00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:43,578
And what about the other cops?

538
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:44,981
You think they're gonna
call him a hero, too?

539
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:47,883
He did the right thing.

540
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,252
You know how much internal
damage control I have to do?

541
00:36:50,286 --> 00:36:52,121
We'll handle it.

542
00:36:52,154 --> 00:36:54,723
We always do, huh?

543
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,659
Chief Banks,
WF Action News here.

544
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,199
Are you in?

545
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:10,272
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I think your face

546
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:12,942
was trespassing on my property.

547
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:14,276
Is there something
I can help you with?

548
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:16,278
No.

549
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:18,513
All right. Fuck you very much.

550
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:46,242
For Detective Zeke Banks.

551
00:37:52,782 --> 00:37:54,250
Banks, incoming.

552
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:55,885
On my desk. Right now.

553
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:57,086
A courier brought it.

554
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,220
We're holding him
for questioning.

555
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:18,074
<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

556
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:21,177
<i>Salvation was offered,
but it was declined.</i>

557
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,212
This fucker thinks he's Jigsaw.

558
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:25,081
Even got a doll this time.

559
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:27,682
<i>I have a bone to pick
with the police department,</i>

560
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:29,819
<i>and if you're going
to point fingers...</i>

561
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,619
12th Street Bridge.
I know that place.

562
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:33,856
<i>...you should start by
pointing them at yourselves.</i>

563
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:35,391
Geez, that's two blocks away.

564
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:38,693
<i>Until you come clean,
many more will die.</i>

565
00:38:55,244 --> 00:38:56,744
Stay back.

566
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,082
Stay sharp.

567
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,162
Whoa,
hold it there, guys.

568
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:40,755
What a sick fuck, man.

569
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:49,298
What the fuck?

570
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:50,698
Oh, no...

571
00:39:56,071 --> 00:39:57,806
God almighty.

572
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,041
9-8-2.

573
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:01,844
It's Fitch.

574
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:02,912
<i>This is Detective Banks</i>

575
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,313
requesting backup.

576
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:06,714
<i>I'm on Decker Street.
Request backup!</i>

577
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:08,017
- Fuck him.
- <i>In pursuit,</i>

578
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,752
requesting backup!

579
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:24,400
- Ah, fuck!
- Fuck me.

580
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:34,810
You're going
to be okay, stay with me.

581
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:36,078
You're good,
you're gonna be okay.

582
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:37,246
You're gonna be just fine.

583
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:38,447
- Zeke!
- Sir! Please, please!

584
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,149
Let us do our job, come on.

585
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:41,884
Come on, let us do our jobs,
let's go. Let's go.

586
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:45,187
Where the fuck
were all of you, huh?

587
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:48,791
My son called for backup
three times in eight minutes

588
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,725
and none of you motherfuckers
could get here?

589
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,761
Nobody? Nothing?

590
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:56,265
Crickets. All right,
this is what I'm going to do.

591
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:58,267
I'm going to call Dispatch

592
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,870
and find out
who was closest available,

593
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:05,274
and when I do,
I'm going to take this gun

594
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:07,009
and shoot that motherfucker.

595
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:09,411
We clear?

596
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:11,447
Fitch, it was you?

597
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,048
You fucking with my son again?

598
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:15,918
God damn you, son of a bitch!

599
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:17,253
Get off me!

600
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:18,487
You're done, motherfucker,
you hear me?

601
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,155
You're fucking done!

602
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,825
Don't let me see
your face again.

603
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:25,928
All right, call Kraus,

604
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:28,030
find out Fitch's last location.

605
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,210
<i>Hello, Detective Fitch.</i>

606
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,912
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

607
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:48,117
<i>The tide of justice
is rising around you.</i>

608
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,853
<i>In 90 seconds,
the water will rise</i>

609
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,988
<i>to the height
of the copper wires,</i>

610
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:55,224
<i>and if you are still
in the tank,</i>

611
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:57,126
<i>you will be electrocuted.</i>

612
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:00,262
<i>Unless you make the sacrifice
that will cleanse you.</i>

613
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:02,064
God... Oh, God...

614
00:42:02,097 --> 00:42:04,900
<i>You murdered a man
because he insulted you.</i>

615
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,335
<i>Put your hands</i>

616
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:08,170
<i>where I can see them,
motherfucker.</i>

617
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:10,072
<i>I said put your hands
where I can see them, sir.</i>

618
00:42:14,443 --> 00:42:16,378
<i>Your finger pulled the trigger</i>

619
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:19,515
<i>and that cannot happen again.</i>

620
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:23,352
<i>Survival is simple,
but it comes with a sacrifice.</i>

621
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:26,522
<i>Bite down on the device
in your mouth,</i>

622
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:28,123
<i>which will start the motor</i>

623
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:29,992
<i>that will
rip your fingers away...</i>

624
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,460
<i>...leaving you free</i>

625
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,329
<i>to escape with your life.</i>

626
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:35,230
<i>But if you don't act quickly,</i>

627
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:38,334
<i>all that awaits you
is this watery tomb.</i>

628
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:41,537
<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

629
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:25,240
Hey, Kraus, anything special about
the bridge where we found the fingers?

630
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:27,042
Yeah, why that bridge?

631
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:30,512
It was where he shot that kid,
Jimmy Lincoln.

632
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:33,248
Then how did you guys
find out about this place?

633
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:34,583
This guy, Benny Wrights,

634
00:44:34,616 --> 00:44:37,052
who Boz was last seen with
on July 4th.

635
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:39,288
How do you know
who Boz was last seen with?

636
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:41,757
We took it off a pawn shop feed
in Stuart Point.

637
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,192
And you didn't tell me.

638
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:46,695
Who the fuck did this?

639
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,131
Somebody who has it out
for the Metro PD.

640
00:44:50,632 --> 00:44:53,202
Or maybe just for Fitch.

641
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,103
You trying to
say something, Drury?

642
00:44:55,137 --> 00:44:56,405
You know what I'm saying.

643
00:44:56,438 --> 00:44:58,340
I doubt you'll be
shedding tears for Fitch.

644
00:44:58,373 --> 00:44:59,741
All right, come on.
Come on, Zeke.

645
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,276
Fucking asshole.

646
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,511
Okay, ignore him.

647
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:05,647
Did you get anything?

648
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:11,153
Got a name. Benny Wrights.
Last guy Boz was seen with.

649
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:14,056
Okay, find him,
and you got hours, not days.

650
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:18,327
And this is where
Benny gets his meth.

651
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:20,696
You know what that is?

652
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,299
Is this a test?

653
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,768
- Just asking you a question.
- Uh, it's a meth house.

654
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:28,704
You put the money in the bucket,
the meth comes down.

655
00:45:28,737 --> 00:45:32,040
Oh, somebody watched <i>The Wire.</i>

656
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:35,344
This is some
<i>New Jack City</i> shit. Goddamn.

657
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:45,754
Don't we need
a warrant for this?

658
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:47,222
What you talking about?

659
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:50,592
Zeke...

660
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:53,695
Hey, my man, my man.

661
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:55,397
Just trying to get a five,
me and my lady!

662
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,566
It's our anniversary,
we're trying to celebrate,

663
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,835
trying to do
something special.

664
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:01,336
Can I get a five?
How about this iPad?

665
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,705
It's got everything on it.

666
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:07,075
I got passcodes,
I got Netflix, Hulu,

667
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:10,379
uh, Uber Eats, Postmates.
Lots of food, lots of food.

668
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:11,580
Let me see that...

669
00:46:11,613 --> 00:46:12,748
Yo, man,
get the fuck out of here.

670
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:14,449
Do I look
fucking hungry to you?

671
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,184
Yo, yo, it got everything.
It don't fit, though.

672
00:46:16,218 --> 00:46:17,252
Why don't you come down?

673
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:18,453
Get the fuck out of here!

674
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:19,856
Come back
when you get some money!

675
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:22,391
Okay, okay. I need money,
I need money.

676
00:46:22,424 --> 00:46:23,525
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

677
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:24,693
I got some,
I got some money.

678
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,295
I got some money,
hold up a second.

679
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:27,729
Hold up a second, all right?

680
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,500
All right, send it down, baby.

681
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:34,169
Come on, come on,
let's do this.

682
00:46:36,638 --> 00:46:37,639
Can't wait!

683
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:41,176
Zeke, what the fuck?

684
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:42,177
It's got 10 seconds,
come on!

685
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,245
Jesus Christ.

686
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:49,718
What the fuck?

687
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:51,720
- Move!
- Get out of the way.

688
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:54,791
Out of my way,
out of my way! Police!

689
00:46:54,824 --> 00:46:56,491
Five-o!

690
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,527
- Everybody, five-o!
- Move, move, move! Come on!

691
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,628
Go! Coming through.

692
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:01,196
Fucking cops, man.

693
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,299
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

694
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,201
Shit! Get your dog!

695
00:47:06,234 --> 00:47:08,437
- Fuck you, man.
- Get your fucking dog!

696
00:47:09,671 --> 00:47:11,373
- Now!
- Hey, be nice.

697
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,376
Jesus Christ.

698
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:15,878
Holy fucking shit.

699
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:22,718
What the fuck's going on?

700
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:23,652
Back inside.
Get back inside.

701
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:27,456
Hide your shit!

702
00:47:34,797 --> 00:47:36,598
Come on!

703
00:47:37,432 --> 00:47:38,433
Fuck. Fuck!

704
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:50,612
My fucking leg!

705
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:52,514
Why do you make this shit
so hard?

706
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:54,282
What if I really wanted
to get fucked up?

707
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:55,751
Motherfucker...

708
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:58,253
You got to make it easy
for the customer, skeeve!

709
00:47:58,286 --> 00:48:00,790
My fucking leg!

710
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:04,493
That leg is fucked up.

711
00:48:04,526 --> 00:48:05,661
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

712
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:06,728
Let me get a shot
for the Gram.

713
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,530
Hold on for one second.

714
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:09,564
- What the fuck...
- Hold on, hold on.

715
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:11,500
My man.

716
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:14,269
Here we go!
You want me to tag you?

717
00:48:14,302 --> 00:48:15,671
Fuck... Fuck you.

718
00:48:15,704 --> 00:48:17,372
- Can I tag you, motherfucker?
- Fuck you...

719
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:20,442
You see this man before?

720
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:22,544
I ain't telling you shit!

721
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:24,847
Why, 'cause you're worried about
that bone sticking out your leg?

722
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:26,682
Why don't you
let me sterilize it?

723
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:30,920
No... No... No! Fuck!

724
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:37,659
It's Benny! Stop, please!

725
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:39,394
Everybody knows that
motherfucker Benny Wrights!

726
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:43,866
He's one of
my best customers, man.

727
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,334
When was the last time
you saw him?

728
00:48:46,368 --> 00:48:47,769
I ain't seen the bitch
in two days, man.

729
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:50,706
Word on the street
is that motherfucker OD'd.

730
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:54,309
Fuck this snitch.

731
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:56,779
Fuck!

732
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,249
Well,
that was a waste of time.

733
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:03,820
Well, we know Benny's dead.

734
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:06,421
Meth isn't the type of thing
you take a break from.

735
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,026
Besides, you see that device?

736
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:13,395
That was not designed
by anybody with rotten teeth.

737
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:15,497
What do you think about
this whole Jigsaw angle?

738
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,800
You think it's a, what-do-you-call-them,
one of those disciples?

739
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:20,569
John Kramer
didn't target cops.

740
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:22,839
Whoever did this
has another motive.

741
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,372
Something personal.

742
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:25,942
And they're not
following orders,

743
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:28,310
especially the orders
of a ghost.

744
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,746
Ghost or not,

745
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,682
somebody's out there
pulling all the strings.

746
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:35,450
You think this guy
sent you the boxes

747
00:49:35,484 --> 00:49:36,953
because you're the
lead detective on the case,

748
00:49:36,986 --> 00:49:38,487
or because you're you?

749
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,856
I don't know.

750
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:43,025
Well, you got any enemies?
That aren't cops?

751
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:47,596
I don't know why she
won't give me another chance.

752
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:50,298
I don't know, maybe
it's because you beat her

753
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:51,633
when you drink too much.

754
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,301
You ever think of that?

755
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:56,772
That's some tough love.
Who the hell is this guy?

756
00:49:56,806 --> 00:49:59,976
Ex-cop.
Partner snitched on him,

757
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:03,411
had to do nine years
hard time.

758
00:50:03,445 --> 00:50:06,816
The system spit him out,
now here he is.

759
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:11,720
Hey, Pete.

760
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:18,660
Zeke.

761
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:23,065
Last guy
I expected to see here.

762
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:24,566
You trying to get sober?

763
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,635
Alcohol's not my problem.

764
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:28,637
The glass and the bottle
can kill.

765
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:31,573
How you doing, Pete?

766
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:33,608
Eighteen months sober,
living in a church basement,

767
00:50:33,642 --> 00:50:34,844
who could ask
for anything more?

768
00:50:36,478 --> 00:50:38,781
Who's this?

769
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:40,715
Detective Schenk.
We're working a case together.

770
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,018
Working together?

771
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:43,585
Don't let this guy
catch you jaywalking,

772
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:45,087
or he'll stab you
right in the fucking back.

773
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:48,124
Don't forget, Pete,
you gave me the knife.

774
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,392
You're right, I did.

775
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:51,794
And you witnessed this cop

776
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:53,562
throw the victim
off a rooftop?

777
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,932
And you saw it,
I mean, with your own eyes?

778
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,034
And you can positively ID
this cop?

779
00:50:58,067 --> 00:51:00,502
He's had his foot on the neck of
this community for way too long.

780
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:03,438
We can't have this.

781
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:06,708
I'll testify,
Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.

782
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:16,451
Pete! Pete! What happened?
What happened?

783
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:18,653
He pulled a gun on me.

784
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:23,658
The witness
pulled a gun on you?

785
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:27,529
I was mad for a long time,
but now I take responsibility.

786
00:51:27,562 --> 00:51:29,464
I should have never
pulled the trigger.

787
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:32,902
The guy had a family.

788
00:51:32,935 --> 00:51:35,637
It was crazy back then, right?

789
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,472
We were working
under Article 8.

790
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,543
We were out of control.

791
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:44,479
Cops were given their own
discretion to crack down on crime.

792
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:47,515
Where were you July 4th
at 9:30 p.m.?

793
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:51,486
Really?
That's what you're here for?

794
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:53,722
That's what I'm here for.

795
00:51:53,755 --> 00:51:57,093
Look, some guy came
to a meeting drunk

796
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:59,728
and wanted to fight a sponsor,
so I hit him.

797
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:01,831
Knocked him clean out.

798
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:03,866
Anyway, the cops came.
I'm still on probation,

799
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,002
but lucky for me,
it was O'Brien.

800
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:08,770
He let the whole thing slide
because, you know...

801
00:52:11,506 --> 00:52:12,574
loyalty.

802
00:52:13,575 --> 00:52:14,643
Loyalty.

803
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:16,812
Take care, Pete.

804
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:19,815
God loves you, Zeke.

805
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:23,152
More than you.

806
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:31,493
<i>Can't believe
that guy used to be a cop.</i>

807
00:52:31,526 --> 00:52:33,495
He shot an innocent guy,
but you turned on him?

808
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:36,531
There's a code, and you better
learn how to follow it,

809
00:52:36,564 --> 00:52:39,001
or you're going to spend the rest
of your life watching your back.

810
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:42,004
Fair point.

811
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:43,605
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

812
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:49,711
<i>Leave a message.</i>

813
00:52:49,744 --> 00:52:51,213
Yeah, Dad,
I'm at your apartment.

814
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:52,681
I was here last night.

815
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,649
It doesn't look like
you've been home.

816
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:00,890
All right, give me a call.

817
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:17,206
<i>You've
gotten through to William,</i>

818
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,041
<i>leave a message
after the beep.</i>

819
00:53:19,075 --> 00:53:20,810
Schenk, it's 9:00 a.m.,

820
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:23,245
where the fuck are you?
Give me a call.

821
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:24,880
Just tell me
what happened, okay?

822
00:53:24,914 --> 00:53:27,950
Hey! Hey! Hey!

823
00:53:27,984 --> 00:53:29,251
Put the box on the ground!

824
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:31,653
On the ground!
Hands up! Hands up!

825
00:53:31,686 --> 00:53:33,155
On the ground now!
Hands up, hands up!

826
00:53:35,157 --> 00:53:36,225
Don't move!

827
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:40,229
Get him out of here.

828
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,497
Take him to holding.

829
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,501
I'm sorry, Banks,
he blew right past me.

830
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:52,041
No way, Zeke,
that one is not the same.

831
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:53,608
I'm calling the bomb squad.

832
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:55,643
Angie, you're the head
of the department.

833
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:57,146
We got two dead cops,
there's no time.

834
00:53:58,948 --> 00:54:00,682
Get everybody out.

835
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:02,617
Everybody out! Everybody out!

836
00:54:03,352 --> 00:54:04,652
Everybody, go!

837
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,810
- Is that fucking skin?
- Ugh.

838
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:30,980
"Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?

839
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:35,650
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

840
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:38,620
"I'll take your head."

841
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:40,256
"I'll take your head..."

842
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:43,859
"Am I getting
under your skin...

843
00:54:43,893 --> 00:54:45,161
"Am I getting
under your skin...

844
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,830
"Am I getting
under your skin..."?

845
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:54,070
...family.
This is my wife, Emma,

846
00:54:54,103 --> 00:54:55,271
this is my son, Charlie.

847
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:04,712
What the fuck is that?

848
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,284
Captain, there's something
under here.

849
00:55:17,326 --> 00:55:19,261
Constantine Paints.

850
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:40,316
Thanks, yeah.

851
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:41,350
Follow me.

852
00:55:48,357 --> 00:55:51,093
How do you know
about this place?

853
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:53,429
Zeke, how do you know
about this place?

854
00:55:53,462 --> 00:55:56,232
My dad used to take me here.

855
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:57,867
Watch your step, gentlemen.

856
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,136
It wasn't always
a butcher shop.

857
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:03,072
Used to be Constantine Trains.

858
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:06,041
Like a hobby shop.

859
00:56:21,223 --> 00:56:22,291
Oh, my God.

860
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:45,014
Anything?

861
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:46,815
Well, we're
analyzing the tape recording.

862
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:48,784
<i>Hello, Detective Schenk,</i>

863
00:56:48,817 --> 00:56:50,452
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

864
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:54,390
<i>You were head of your class
at the Police Academy.</i>

865
00:56:54,423 --> 00:56:56,225
He was obviously skinned...

866
00:56:57,493 --> 00:56:59,361
postmortem.

867
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:00,963
Your dad's the reason I wanted
to do this in the first place.

868
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:02,231
<i>...the body was scored first</i>

869
00:57:02,264 --> 00:57:04,867
to remove the pieces
in larger strips,

870
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,870
arms, neck,
as he ripped the skin...

871
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:12,041
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

872
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:13,342
Even the defensive wounds,

873
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,977
he clearly tried to fight back,

874
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,744
which explains
the deeper gashes.

875
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:26,255
Captain, over here.

876
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,123
Is it a serial killer
targeting cops?

877
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:30,025
Is the victim inside
a policeman?

878
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,294
No comment. Commissioner Hart
will make a statement tonight.

879
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,066
We got to try
to keep his identity

880
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:39,168
out of the press
until I tell his wife.

881
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,007
<i>"Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?"</i>

882
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:10,432
Hey, O'Brien.

883
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:11,500
Yeah, boss?

884
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:12,534
You seen Zeke?

885
00:58:13,836 --> 00:58:15,337
No, not for a while.

886
00:58:15,371 --> 00:58:16,905
Okay, I'm heading down
to Cold Case.

887
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:18,374
Copy that, Captain.

888
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,245
<i>I need all available units,</i>

889
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:25,247
<i>officer down 3rd and Beaman.</i>

890
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:27,449
<i>Please report, 3rd and Beaman.</i>

891
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,235
What do we got?

892
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:49,071
I was writing a ticket
and some guy in a pig's mask,

893
00:58:49,104 --> 00:58:50,472
he runs up on me with a knife.

894
00:58:50,506 --> 00:58:52,274
So, he stabs your arm
and just takes off?

895
00:58:52,308 --> 00:58:53,575
I fought him off
the best I could and he...

896
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:55,277
He took off running.

897
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:58,314
Is there any reason
he would have to attack you?

898
00:58:58,347 --> 00:59:01,850
No. He just wanted
to mess with the cops.

899
00:59:01,884 --> 00:59:05,854
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

900
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:07,222
"I'll take your head."

901
00:59:07,256 --> 00:59:09,858
Angie, you're the head
of the department.

902
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:11,193
Angie...

903
00:59:11,226 --> 00:59:12,461
Ah, fuck!

904
00:59:12,494 --> 00:59:14,196
Angie! Pick up!

905
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:24,273
<i>Hey, you've
reached Captain Angie Garza,</i>

906
00:59:24,306 --> 00:59:25,074
<i>leave a message at the tone.
Thanks.</i>

907
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:34,917
Angie, get to the bullpen!
He's coming for you.

908
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,259
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

909
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:48,130
Shit!

910
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:52,034
Hey! Hey! Hey!

911
01:00:02,544 --> 01:00:06,148
Hello? Hello! Shit!

912
01:01:05,774 --> 01:01:08,010
Help!

913
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,978
Help!

914
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,316
<i>Hello, Captain Garza.</i>

915
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:16,051
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

916
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:18,487
<i>You have covered up corruption
in your department,</i>

917
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,256
<i>never sticking your neck out
for the innocent.</i>

918
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,592
<i>Now, the cover-up
will be on you.</i>

919
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:26,328
<i>In a few seconds,
boiling hot wax</i>

920
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:28,630
<i>will be coming out of the pipe
above you.</i>

921
01:01:28,664 --> 01:01:31,733
<i>The only way to stop yourself
from being suffocated</i>

922
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:33,669
<i>is to sever your spinal cord</i>

923
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:35,671
<i>with the blade
beneath your neck,</i>

924
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:37,372
<i>which will stop the wax.</i>

925
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:38,740
<i>You cannot walk away,</i>

926
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:40,476
<i>but you can survive.</i>

927
01:01:40,509 --> 01:01:42,411
<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

928
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:45,547
Fuck you!

929
01:01:54,122 --> 01:01:57,493
Angie! Angie!

930
01:01:57,526 --> 01:01:59,361
Get the fuck out of the way!

931
01:02:15,744 --> 01:02:17,479
How come no one
is answering the phone?

932
01:02:17,513 --> 01:02:19,348
An officer was attacked,
it's fucking chaos in here.

933
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:22,451
Angie! Angie!

934
01:02:26,488 --> 01:02:27,489
Angie?

935
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,758
Zeke, what's going on?

936
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:30,827
He's got her!

937
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,094
Who's got her?

938
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:34,096
The killer has Angie!

939
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:35,330
I guess you didn't hear,
the killer just

940
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:37,099
attacked a cop
at 3rd and Beaman.

941
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:40,435
That was just a diversion
to get us out of the precinct.

942
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:42,304
She's down
in the fucking basement!

943
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:54,116
Did you find Angie?

944
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,084
In the basement,
in the basement!

945
01:02:56,118 --> 01:02:57,719
<i>Captain Angie Garza,</i>

946
01:02:57,753 --> 01:02:59,488
<i>call the front desk.</i>

947
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:16,138
Open it!

948
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:18,307
Hurry up!

949
01:03:19,274 --> 01:03:20,642
Angie!

950
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:23,145
Open it!

951
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:24,179
Okay.

952
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:29,618
Shit!

953
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:35,424
It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

954
01:03:35,457 --> 01:03:36,491
Oh, my God.

955
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,564
It's okay.

956
01:03:43,565 --> 01:03:44,566
It's okay... Oh...

957
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,693
Lock it down.

958
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:46,328
You understand me?

959
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:48,664
Lock it down, nobody gets out
of this precinct.

960
01:04:48,697 --> 01:04:51,400
I need all the footage
from the cameras

961
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:52,634
in the evidence room.

962
01:04:53,535 --> 01:04:54,603
Okay, here...

963
01:04:54,636 --> 01:04:55,938
Here's when the call came in,

964
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:58,540
but then there's nothing
until you come in.

965
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:03,745
You see right there, it jumps
from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch?

966
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,882
No, there's no glitch,
because look,

967
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:07,549
on the first frame,
the safe door is open,

968
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:08,885
but on the next, it's shut.

969
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:10,385
There's 13 minutes missing.

970
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:11,821
Access to this footage,

971
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:13,522
is that through
the computer system?

972
01:05:13,555 --> 01:05:15,223
Yeah, we just need
a badge number and a password.

973
01:05:15,257 --> 01:05:16,993
I can't tell you
who deleted the video,

974
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:20,429
but I can access who logged into
the server over the past day.

975
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:23,900
O'Brien, Tupper, Nicholazi...

976
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:27,469
Wait...
Who's badge number 2-1-3?

977
01:05:27,502 --> 01:05:29,371
Pete Dunleavy, my old partner.

978
01:05:29,404 --> 01:05:31,440
Dunleavy?
He shouldn't have access.

979
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:33,642
How long's it been
since he was even on the job?

980
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:35,878
Where you going?

981
01:05:35,912 --> 01:05:37,479
To pay Pete a visit.

982
01:05:37,512 --> 01:05:39,816
Zeke, he's not the only one!

983
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,349
Your father had access, too.

984
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:42,919
Location of Schenk's body,

985
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:45,454
you said it was where
your father took you as a kid.

986
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:47,422
When was the last time
you saw your father?

987
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:51,460
- This morning.
- Bullshit.

988
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:54,030
Motherfucker!

989
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:55,330
What the fuck, Zeke?

990
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:56,799
Fuck you, man!

991
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,433
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck out of here!

992
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:02,404
Get him out of here! Fuck you!
You're too close!

993
01:06:02,437 --> 01:06:03,940
You're too close
to this thing, Zeke.

994
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:17,686
Pete!

995
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:19,889
Pete!

996
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,290

<i>Leave a message.</i>

998
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:34,636

three times,

please call me back!

1000
01:06:36,939 --> 01:06:40,575
People are asking questions
and I'm sick of making excuses.

1001
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:42,912
You got something
to tell me? Fuck!

1002
01:07:49,644 --> 01:07:51,580
You wanna play games,
motherfucker?

1003
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:54,749
All right, I'll play.

1004
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,685
You okay?

1005
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:41,023
Hey!

1008
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,266
Pete, wake up.

1009
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:31,300
Pete!

1010
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,306
What? Zeke?

1011
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:38,640
Fuck.

1012
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:41,177
Get me the fuck down, Zeke.

1013
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:42,845
Come on!

1014
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:44,213
You hacked the computer.

1015
01:11:45,747 --> 01:11:47,983
You erased
the surveillance footage.

1016
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:49,684
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Zeke.

1017
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:51,353
- Did you kill Angie?
- What?

1018
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:52,855
Did you kill Boz?

1019
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:53,889
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1020
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:55,224
Did you kill Boz?

1021
01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:57,159
Boz? Fuck...

1022
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:58,227
What the fuck
is with you, Zeke?

1023
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,795
Get me the fuck out of here!

1024
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:02,298
Is this some sick
fucking revenge, Zeke?

1025
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:04,366
Putting me in jail
isn't enough, huh?

1026
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,935
Get me the fuck out of here!

1054
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:49,832
Fuck. I got you, I got you.

1055
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:54,903
Come on, Pete.

1056
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:01,477
Pete!

1057
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:03,312
Pete!

1058
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,382
You disloyal
piece of shit.

1059
01:16:17,586 --> 01:16:21,190
I've been loyal to you
since the first day we met.

1060
01:16:22,257 --> 01:16:24,426
Fifteen years ago.

1061
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,929
The day your partner
killed my father.

1062
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:32,034
So, Charlie,

1063
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:34,503
you saw this cop throw
the victim off a rooftop,

1064
01:16:34,536 --> 01:16:36,939
and you can positively ID
this cop?

1065
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:39,141
I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy.

1066
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:40,242
I'll do it.

1067
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:53,155
Pete! Pete!
What happened, what happened?

1068
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:54,390
He pulled a gun on me.

1069
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:56,158
The witness
pulled a gun on you?

1070
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:01,697
Shh.

1071
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,999
Pete killed Charlie Emmerson.

1072
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:06,201
What? You thought
I'd use my real name?

1073
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:08,203
Do you have any idea
how hard it was

1074
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:09,938
to get placed
in this department,

1075
01:17:09,972 --> 01:17:12,074
to get assigned
to be your partner?

1076
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:18,213
What about your family,
what about your son?

1077
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:19,581
This is my son,
Charlie.

1078
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:23,485
I don't have a son.

1079
01:17:25,754 --> 01:17:27,189
Charlie's sleeping...

1080
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:29,124
...was sleeping.

1081
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:30,993
<i>After Benny Wrights led Boz
down the subway tunnels...</i>

1082
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:36,432
I tattooed my dad's name
on his arm.

1083
01:17:39,268 --> 01:17:40,702
Where is my father?

1084
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:42,271
You'll see him soon.

1085
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:44,106
Where the fuck is my father?

1086
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:46,742
I didn't even ask him
to come down here. You did.

1087
01:17:46,775 --> 01:17:48,043
Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

1088
01:17:48,076 --> 01:17:49,111
Okay.

1089
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:50,746
Thank you.

1090
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:52,347
And don't drain
my battery watching <i>Twilight.</i>

1091
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:14,736
Where is he?

1092
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,338
Don't you want to hear
my offer?

1093
01:18:16,371 --> 01:18:17,439
Do I have a choice?

1094
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:21,076
I want to be partners.

1095
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:24,146
You took a stand, Zeke,
against a dirty cop,

1096
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:25,280
<i>and what did it get you?</i>

1097
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:31,386
A lifetime of watching
your back, working alone.

1098
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,288
Getting the call
for every homeless bum

1099
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:35,023
who turns up dead.

1100
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:36,124
I mean, let's be real,
some of these motherfuckers

1101
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:37,759
are straight up evil.

1102
01:18:37,794 --> 01:18:39,728
Fitch not backing you up...

1103
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:41,396
Fuck him.

1104
01:18:42,564 --> 01:18:44,032
He won't repeat that mistake.

1105
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:48,537
<i>And Boz,
always lying under oath...</i>

1106
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:52,341
But you, you're different.

1107
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:55,143
You're Metro's finest.

1108
01:18:55,177 --> 01:18:57,145
That's why I want to
team up with you on this.

1109
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,449
You find the dirty cops and
I'll take care of the rest.

1110
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:03,285
You want me to help you
kill cops?

1111
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:04,620
No, fuck no.

1112
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:06,655
Just the bad ones.

1113
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:10,259
John Kramer was right,
the spiral.

1114
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:14,463
A symbol of change,
evolution, progress.

1115
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:16,331
But why limit that
to an individual

1116
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:18,567
when you can apply it
to a whole system?

1117
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,837
You got shot
for doing the right thing.

1118
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,471
But let's face it, these cops?

1119
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:23,739
They're not going to clean up
on their own.

1120
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:26,208
But we take a tongue here,

1121
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:28,677
a few bones there,
they'll come around.

1122
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:31,814
We're going to fix
a broken department. Okay?

1123
01:19:31,848 --> 01:19:33,348
You and me.

1124
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:34,383
Okay.

1125
01:19:35,684 --> 01:19:36,685
Okay.

1126
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:39,154
Let's do it.

1127
01:19:39,187 --> 01:19:42,157
I want to trust you. I do.

1128
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:45,127
I'm in. But my dad goes free.

1129
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:52,501
One second.

1130
01:19:52,534 --> 01:19:54,804
<i>911,
please state your emergency.</i>

1131
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:56,839
Hello, uh, I'm at
the old soap factory

1132
01:19:56,873 --> 01:19:58,273
on Madigan Lane.

1133
01:19:58,307 --> 01:19:59,641
There's a crazy guy
with a gun,

1134
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,610
he's firing it everywhere.
Please hurry!

1135
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:03,345
What the fuck was that?

1136
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:05,247
You better hurry,
Zeke, SWAT's on the way.

1137
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,683
Look, I want to believe you,
I do.

1138
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:11,353
I want to trust you.

1139
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:14,189
Take this, you'll need it.

1140
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:15,223
Come on.

1141
01:20:16,926 --> 01:20:18,527
Let's go see your dad.

1142
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,170
It's time for your final test.

1143
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:41,650
Dad.

1144
01:20:41,683 --> 01:20:42,718
Ezekiel.

1145
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:44,286
Oh, shit! Get him down!

1146
01:20:49,524 --> 01:20:50,759
Oh, shit.

1147
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:55,163
I got you, Dad.

1148
01:20:55,197 --> 01:20:56,632
Zeke. Help me, son.

1149
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:01,737
Don't worry, don't worry.

1150
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:04,606
I'm not going to let you die.
I will get you down.

1151
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:10,245
It's all right, just hold on.

1152
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:12,247
Shoot this motherfucker
right now.

1153
01:21:13,783 --> 01:21:16,618
Get him down!
Get him down now!

1154
01:21:17,854 --> 01:21:19,789
I thought we were partners.

1155
01:21:19,822 --> 01:21:22,224
You going to shoot me, Zeke?

1156
01:21:22,257 --> 01:21:23,492
With your one bullet?

1157
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:24,593
Bad idea.

1158
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:25,862
It kills your dad.

1159
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,265
He took a shot at me,
by the way.

1160
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,934
Missed.

1161
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:33,635
I wasted four.

1162
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:35,437
That means
you got one shot left, Zeke.

1163
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:41,376
All right, cops are here.
That gives us four minutes.

1164
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,813
Do you know there's 1.5 gallons
of blood in the human body, Zeke?

1165
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:50,452
At the rate
your old man is bleeding out,

1166
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:53,388
in just three minutes,
those jars will be full

1167
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:56,291
and your dad will be dead.

1168
01:21:56,324 --> 01:21:57,726
The only thing
that can set him free

1169
01:21:57,759 --> 01:22:01,730
is the bullet in your gun
fired at that target.

1170
01:22:01,763 --> 01:22:03,933
Either way, I've got
a foolproof way out of here.

1171
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:06,768
You're not Jigsaw.

1172
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:08,570
That's the game.

1173
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:12,474
Shoot me and you both lose.

1174
01:22:12,507 --> 01:22:15,277
Shoot the target
and we both win.

1175
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:16,578
You want to play?

1176
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:20,248
I'm dying, Zeke,
end it now.

1177
01:22:20,282 --> 01:22:21,784
<i>In this corridor.</i>

1178
01:22:21,818 --> 01:22:23,719
<i>Roger that.
Southwest entrance.</i>

1179
01:22:25,054 --> 01:22:26,421
<i>Going through the south door.</i>

1180
01:22:28,623 --> 01:22:30,425
<i>Nothing here. Keep moving.</i>

1181
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:31,928
I need you all in.

1182
01:22:31,961 --> 01:22:33,562
Dunleavy ruined both our lives

1183
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:35,397
and you tried to help
that piece of shit?

1184
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,666
- Zeke!
- Pete!

1185
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:39,568
You failed that test.

1186
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:41,670
Now I need you to choose
who you're really with.

1187
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:43,605
The man
who corrupted the force,

1188
01:22:43,638 --> 01:22:45,640
or the one
who's trying to save it.

1189
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:46,742
You want to tell him, Chief?

1190
01:22:49,377 --> 01:22:51,047
Tell me what?

1191
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,850
Tell him about all the fucking
shit you did under Article 8.

1192
01:22:54,884 --> 01:22:56,451
What's he talking about?

1193
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:58,020
- Time's running out.
- What's he talking about?

1194
01:22:58,054 --> 01:23:01,356
Citizens were dying.

1195
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:05,027
We did what we had to
to clean up the streets.

1196
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:06,896
It was crazy
back then, right?

1197
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:08,931
We were working
under Article 8,

1198
01:23:08,965 --> 01:23:10,332
we were out of control.

1199
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,402
Murder rate went way down.

1200
01:23:14,436 --> 01:23:16,505
That's fucking bullshit.

1201
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:18,306
People felt safe again.

1202
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,776
The streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier.

1203
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,644
Your dad oversaw
the whole thing, by the way.

1204
01:23:22,677 --> 01:23:25,580
Innocent people getting shot,
all in the name of justice.

1205
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:26,916
Article 8 was
one of the most corrupt

1206
01:23:26,949 --> 01:23:28,818
police policies in history,

1207
01:23:28,851 --> 01:23:30,552
and guess who was
your dad's right-hand man?

1208
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:32,454
Sorry, or should I say woman,
the whole time?

1209
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:35,524
We'll handle it.
We always do, huh?

1210
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:36,591
Angie?

1211
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:37,726
Angie!

1212
01:23:37,759 --> 01:23:39,361
It was Angie.

1213
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:40,629
I mean,
not a massive surprise.

1214
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:42,531
You think it was
her stellar reputation

1215
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:44,466
that got her a precinct
at age 35? Come on.

1216
01:23:44,499 --> 01:23:47,502
Shoot this piece of shit,
Ezekiel. Now.

1217
01:23:47,536 --> 01:23:49,105
Yeah, that's right,
because that's what cops do.

1218
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:50,505
Shoot first,
ask questions later.

1219
01:23:53,876 --> 01:23:57,079
You watched my father die
and I'm trying to save yours.

1220
01:23:57,113 --> 01:23:58,948
If we're going to trust
each other,

1221
01:23:58,981 --> 01:23:59,982
I need you to do this.

1222
01:24:01,516 --> 01:24:02,919
Ezekiel...

1223
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:06,956
You've always done
the right thing, do it now.

1224
01:24:06,989 --> 01:24:08,757
This piece of shit
is killing cops.

1225
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:12,394
You still need to decide,

1226
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:15,898
you can shoot me, or...

1227
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:16,999
Or you can save your dad.

1228
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:20,569
Clock's ticking, man.

1229
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:21,736
Think fast.

1230
01:24:22,637 --> 01:24:24,140
Cavalry's coming.

1231
01:24:24,173 --> 01:24:26,508
But not in time to do
any favors for your old man.

1232
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:27,709
Only you can do that.

1233
01:24:35,985 --> 01:24:37,352
Dad? Dad?

1234
01:24:38,553 --> 01:24:39,554
Shots fired!

1235
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:50,665
Zeke... Zeke.

1236
01:24:51,834 --> 01:24:52,869
It's going to be okay.

1237
01:24:52,902 --> 01:24:56,072
He's getting away.

1238
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:58,140
Don't let him get away.

1239
01:24:58,808 --> 01:25:00,910
Go... Go!

1240
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:21,030
Stop. Don't come in.

1241
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:22,098
Don't come in.

1242
01:25:37,046 --> 01:25:38,047
Oh, God.

1243
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:42,919
Whoever did this has another
motive, something personal.

1244
01:25:42,952 --> 01:25:44,153
Whoever did this...

1245
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:48,024
...they're pulling
all the strings.

1246
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:53,896
Your dad is the reason
for all of this.

1247
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:55,730
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

1248
01:25:55,764 --> 01:25:57,666
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

1249
01:26:04,606 --> 01:26:06,541
What the fuck is going on?

1250
01:26:10,512 --> 01:26:13,082
Go, go, go!

1251
01:26:13,115 --> 01:26:14,716
Get down! Get down now!

1252
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:15,785
Let me see your hands!

1253
01:26:16,685 --> 01:26:17,820
No! No, no, stop!

1254
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:19,055
No! God!

1255
01:26:19,088 --> 01:26:20,722
- Freeze!
- No, no!

1256
01:26:24,026 --> 01:26:25,061
No!

1257
01:26:25,094 --> 01:26:26,461
Put it down!

1258
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:29,098
Lower your weapon!

1259
01:26:29,131 --> 01:26:30,132
Fire!

1260
01:26:53,055 --> 01:26:56,025
No!

1261
01:26:59,593 --> 01:27:04,593
