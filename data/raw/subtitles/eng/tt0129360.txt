to send us to Big Bear.

Son, I think you're a little old
to believe in Santa Claus.

He exists, Dad.
I've seen him.

in fairy tales.

26
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,748
That was nearly 32 cents
down the drain.

27
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,168
It's a small price to pay

00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,680
Just working hard.

105
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,474
You know, you don't often hear
anybody say that nowadays.

106
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,893
Me, I'm gonna retire.

107
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,312
I'm moving out to the links

108
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,563
No.
Yeah, but first,

109
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,232
I got to find somebody
to run all five lots.

110
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,193
Somebody to take my place.

111
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,611
Really?

112
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,989
You're looking good, kid.

113
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,409
Real good, but so are all
the other lot managers.

114
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,620
It's hard
to pick just one.

115
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,830
Well, I've come up
with an idea.

116
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,832
A brilliant idea.

117
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,334

120
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,008
gets to be CEO

00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,761
Hmm, air-conditioned office,
pay raise,

122

123

for the right man.

124
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,904
Now, Eric,
on the Van Nuys lot,

125
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,697
he's liable to give you
a run for your money.

126
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,325
He's nothing.
I'll squash him.

127
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,035
You got
the killer instinct.

128
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,245
I like that, kid.

129
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,914
But I got to have
a guarantee.

130
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,377
Picked it up cheap.

131
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,920
Now look, if you was

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,881

138
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,522
Teddy's never had
a white Christmas.

139
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,275

140
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,776
It's overrated.

141
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,862
The last two years
I've promised Teddy
snow at Christmas

142
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,197
and I've flaked on him.

143
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,449
Hey, that's a funny bit.
Huh?

144
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,784
Snow, flaked.

145
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,577
You-- oh, never mind.

146
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:41,539
Listen, he can have
a white Christmas next year

147
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,957

148
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,169

camel-like things up there.

00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,589
Gazelles.
Nah.

150
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,091
Uh, impalas?

151
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,969
No, no, no,

Yeah, yeah, llamas.

154
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,099
Cute as heck.
Eat right out of your hands.

155
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,559
Tony will--
Teddy.

156
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,352
Whatever.
He'll love it.

157
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,520
I know.

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,605

I can do it.

159
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,161
Eh, your choice.

160
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,204
I just didn't think you'd
wanna be hustling cars

161
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,332
on this hot lot
the rest of your life.

162
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,794
Okay, I'll do it.

163
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,131
But if one of those llamas
bites my kid, I'll sue.

164
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,883
Yeah, smart move.

165
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,634
You won't regret it,
trust me.

166
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,430
Hey, take the car around back

to chase me.

I asked Santa for.

176
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,014

in Santa Claus?

177
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,557
Yeah.
Don't you?

178
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,060
I guess.
My dad doesn't.

179
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,479
But he has to believe
in Santa Claus.

180
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,231
Listen,
just think about it.

181
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,359
How could he fit all the
presents for all the kids

182
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,652
in that one sleigh?

183
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,445
Think of all the kids
in the universe.

184
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,697
There's no way.

185
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,740
And deliver them
in one night?

186
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,741
I don't think so.

187
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,701
I don't know
how he does it.

188
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,453
He just does.

189
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,288
It's the magic
of Christmas.

190
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,623
It just doesn't
make sense.

191

I better go.

193

See you.

195
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,514
I know there's a Santa.

196
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,266

(distant dog barking)

198
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,876
He's one second ahead
of the world record.

199
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,254
He's won three gold, six silvers
and one bronze already.

200
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,839
Let 's see if
he'll win another medal.

201
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,340
And yes!
He's got it!

202

Another world record
and another gold medal

Yes!
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

Hi, honey!

206
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,899
Look, Teddy and I
rented everything.

207
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,942
Well, better get
a refund.

208
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,527
We aren't going.
What?

209
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,739
I'm going to be working 12-hour
shifts through Christmas Eve.

210
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,574
Gordon, this is
the second year in a row

211
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,242
you've canceled our
Christmas plans.

212
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,162
I had to go to
the NASCAR races last year.

213
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,164
Ambrose invited me,
I couldn't say no.

214
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,790
It was-- it was business.

215
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,585
You just wanted to watch
the demolition derby

216
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,794
and the year before that,

217
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,796
you had to watch all those
football games.

218
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,924
I had money on those,
our money.

219
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,717
We might have
been wiped out.

220
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,302
Fine Christmas that would
have been, huh?

221
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,055
(grunts)
Gordon, you promised Teddy.

222
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,224
I know, I know,
but look at the big picture.

223
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,267
I'm going to be CEO
of Slykes Used Cars.

224
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,269
Slykes Used Cars

better for yourself.

227
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,525
We're not going?

228
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,320
Sorry, Teddy.

229
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,200
Dad?

230
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,993
I know I promised.

231
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,703
But if I stay
and work extra hard,

232
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,205
that means I'll get
a new job

233
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,790
and we can move
to a nicer house.

234
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,750
Next year
we'll go skiing in Aspen.

235

What are you doing here?

359
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,347
I don't want to see you
get in any more trouble

360
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,514
than you're already in.

361
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,974
I thought you were
indigestion.

362
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,809
No, I'm your worst
nightmare.

363
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,519
A visible conscience.

364
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,355
Who are you
talking to, kid?

365
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,898
That elf.

366
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,317
She says I'm going to be
a Secret Santa.

367
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,235
Oh, goody.

368
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,196
Can she make
me one, too?

369
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,238
Oh...

370
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,740
You don't see her?

371
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,158
Gordon, over here.

372
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,618
I'm on a tight schedule.

373
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,579
I just came down here
to warn you about your boss.

374
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,414
Now, as a Secret Santa,

375
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,333
we'd like you to keep
your nose clean.

376
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,710
Why don't you just
leave me alone?!

377
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,338
Kid, come on,
pull yourself together.

378
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,006
Get over here.

379
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,383
You don't see her?

380
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,093
See who?
What--

381
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,762
You know, all of a sudden,
you're not sounding

382
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,097
like CEO material.

383
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,307
No, I am.
I am.

384

Uh, gimmick.

385
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,102
You were saying
I needed a gimmick.

386
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,645
Yeah.
I got one.

387
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,271
Secret Santa.

388
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,941
I'll dress up
like Santa Claus.

389
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,403

every hour

what car the keys
in my pocket will start.

392
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,786
And none of the keys
will fit.

393
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,621
Ooh, I like it.
I like it.

394
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,125
So keep those cars coming,
I'm gonna need a lot of them.

395
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,877

Nothing, I was hoping
to save it for my son.

It's an awfully

It's the holiday season.

422
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,995
Nobody buys a car
at Christmas.

at least one car a day,

Okay, I'll take it.

427
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,929
Great.
We'll talk in my office.

428
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,181
You know ,it's a good thing
you're buying this right now

429
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,267
because by the time
I'm old enough to drive,

430
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,726
all that stuff leaking
on the bottom

431
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,228
will probably
be all be gone.

The last car that was parked
here had a little oil leak

436
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,906
and he forgot to clean it up.
(chuckles)

437
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,327
Look, there it goes.
I just saw more oil drip.

438

I don't see anything.

439
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,005

else for a car today.

No, but I--
Look, son!

It's a tough world
that's divided

447

into two types of people,

suckers and winners.

449
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,489
Winners are winners
because of suckers.

450
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,284
Suckers help winners
by giving them their money.

Don't make your dad's world
any tougher, okay?

is tonight at 7:00.

be a great way

454
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,711

455
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,754

I'd be very surprised
if your father shows up.

462
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,207

I know he will.

Please don't get
your hopes up.

faith, I guess.

Santa Claus doesn't say,
"Hey, man,"

or, "What's going on,
dude?"

507

he says, "Ho, ho, ho!"

00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,102
Ho, ho, ho.

538
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,939
Argh!

539
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,238
Ahh!

540
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,348
Kirk!

541
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,776
Gordon?

542
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,903
Pretty good, huh?

543
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,742
You look just like
Santa Claus.

544
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,370
The beard's incredible.

545
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,455
Don't touch.

546
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,458
It even feels real.

547
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,128
Who did this for you?

548
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:25,258
I, uh, know someone
in the business... actually.

549
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,093
Sure looks good.

550
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,555
You, uh, look pretty good
yourself.

551
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,016
Don't get any ideas.

552
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,566
(distant basketball bouncing,
feet squeaking)

553
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,491
You're a half hour late.

554
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,077
Well, that's the last time
I'm gonna be late.

555
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,495
What do you mean?

556
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,331
Mom's moving us to Phoenix.

557
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,958
You're mom and dad
aren't getting along?

558
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,961
I think this is it.

559
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,963
They're both being
so stubborn.

560
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,715
Neither of them
will give in.

561
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,592
If only my dad would
just say he's sorry.

562
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,679
I think we're just gonna have
to say we're sorry for him.

563
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,764
What?

564
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,682
Follow me.

565
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,107
We need about $40.

566
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,484
What for?

567
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,403
Don't tell me you have
no idea what we're doing?

568
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,946
No, I don't.

569
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,531
You're such a boy.

570
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,867
Like father,
like son, I guess.

571
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,495
We only have about $3 here.

572
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,622
(coins clanking)

573
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,626
You know any way
we can get more?

574
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,337
I think I have an idea.

575
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,714
That's a first.

576
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,966
Step right up,
step right up.

577
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,093
Don't push.

578
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,636
There's plenty of room inside.

579
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,097
For just 25 cents,
you can come see

580
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,141
Teddy, the amazing
electric boy.

581
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,770
Just don't look before
it's your turn, please.

582
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,697
(woman)
Hello, little boy.

583
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,657
(shuddering)

584
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,119
Nice to shock you, miss.

585
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,788
Thank you.
(coin clunks)

586
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,876
That kid's got
a lot of talent.

587
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,380
Next.

588
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,632
Thank you,
thank you.

589
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,884
Check this out.

590
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,763
(shuddering)

591
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,056
(thud)

592
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,266
Next.

593
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,020
Thank you.

594
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,856
(coins clinking)

595
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,607
Finally,
something I'm good at.

596
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,193
I'm not so sure
about that.

597
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,613
But we almost have
the $40 we need.

598
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,781
Next!

599
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,949
Next.

600
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,204
$21.52.

601
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,539
What do you have?

602
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,208
$22.11.
We did it!

603
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,376
Great!

604
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,628
Now will you mind telling me
what all of this is for?

605
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,047
A dozen roses.

606
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,631
Flowers?
Mm-hmm.

607
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,009
All that work
for flowers?!

608
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,844
Not flowers... roses.

609
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,221
Sure glad I didn't tell you
beforehand.

610
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,808
Why don't we get her something
cool, like a pocketknife?

611
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,809
Right.

612
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,728
Felipe's Flowers is
around the corner.

613
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,812
They deliver.

614
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,606
You buy a dozen red roses.

615
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,941
Then with the extra money
you have left, buy a card.

616
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,651
Have Felipe
fill it out for you.

617
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,738
You want me to tell them
to write something gushy?

618
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,407
Now you're catching on.

619
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,909
Aren't you coming?

620
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,495
I think this is something you
should do on your own.

621
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,088
(pounding on door)

622
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,845
(indistinct conversation
on TV)

623
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,645
Carla Covington?

624
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,562
Uh, yes.

625
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,314
Sign here, please.
Wow!

626
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,440
Who are they from?

627
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
The card is
in the flowers, ma'am.

628
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,486
Oh, my.

629
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,613
Well, thank you.

630
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,781
Merry Christmas.

631
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,324
Merry Christmas to you.

632
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,162
(Teddy's voice)
"I know I've been acting
a little crazy

633
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,790
"but I love and beg
you will forgive me.

634
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,210
"And don't forget to give Teddy
an advance on his allowance.

635
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,795
Love, Gordon."

636
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,963
Hey, Mom.

637
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,132
Wow!
Where'd you get those?

638
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,550
Your father sent them.

639
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,176
He never sends me
flowers.

640
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,761
Well, he's been acting
a little crazy.

641
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,429
You should probably
forgive him.

642
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,889
You know he loves you, Mom.

643
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,975
That's funny.
That's exactly what he said.

644
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,059
How cute.

645
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,103
Like father,
like son, I guess.

646
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,521
Let's not get carried away.

647
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,482
You know, he probably has
suffered enough.

648
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,984
Maybe I should
give him a call.

649
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,026
Yeah!

650
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,486
Hey, folks.

651
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,280
Looking for a Christmas bargain
you can't turn down?

652
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,490
I've got one for you.

653
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,493
I'm Crazy Gordon of
Slykes Used Cars.

654
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,205
Not only am I slashing prices
on all my used cars,

655
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,958
but I'm going to give
a car away every hour

656
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,376
from now and until midnight.

657
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,421
It's part of my
Secret Santa giveaway.

658
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,008
If you can guess which keys in
my pocket start what car,

659
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,302
you get that car for free!

660
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,178
Why?
Because I'm crazy.

661
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,723
And you're crazy if you don't
come on down

662
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,017
to Slykes Used Cars.

663
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,602
We've got the Christmas spirit

664
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,645
so come on down
and get with it.

665
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,564
Crazy Gordon is giving
away cars

666
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,190
because he's lost his senses.

667
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,696
So come, folks, come on down
and see Crazy Gordon!

668
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,795
Was that your father?

669
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,047
Uh, no.

670
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,257
That was Crazy Gordon,
this new guy.

671
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,383
How crazy of me.

672
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,552
I thought he could change.
Uh, Mom.

673
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,013
He's embarrassing
both of us.

674
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,023
Did you see the way those
girls were kissing him?

675
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,900
He's just doing
his job, Mom.

676
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,235
Yeah?
Well, so am I.

677
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,571
He wants to be Santa Claus,
fine.

678
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,074
Here's some snow
for him.

679
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,284
You know what, your father
just doesn't get it.

680
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,998
Guess not.

681
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,751
All right,
that's cut!

682
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,002
Wrap it up, guys.

683
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,923
Well, Mr. Slykes,
what do you think?

684
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,008
Oh, kid, you sure know
what the people like.

685
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,594
Oh, by the way,
Louie and Donny
are bringing over

686
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,639
some cars later tonight.

687
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,517
That CEO job is locked
if you keep this up.

688
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,143
You can bet on it.

689
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,777
What are you doing?

690
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,321
Standing there polishing
Christmas tree ornaments.

691
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,906
Get to work!

692
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,955
You are being
very bad.

693
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,623
Santa won't like this.

694
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,417
I don't see you,
I don't hear you.

695
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,501
I'm ignoring you.

696
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,877
Oh, really?

697
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,631
Yeow!

698
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,434
(lock latching)

699
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,900
Mmm.

700
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,158
(static blaring)

701
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,203
(Lilith on radio)
I don't like being ignored.

702
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,289
You got it.

703
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,499
And stand at attention!

704
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,501
Though most people find t
hard to beliee

705
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,004
that they've been chosn
to be a Santa Clau,

706
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,839
they are eventually convinced,

707
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,382
follow through
with their duties

708
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,633
as they've been instructed,

709
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,594
and are better people
for it.

710
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,887
I...

711
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,971
Don't interrupt.

712
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,890
Okay.
You, on the other hand,

713
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,517
look like a Sant,
but act like a moro.

714
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,353
These commercials you're doing
to sell stolen cars?

715
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,689
They're a disgrae
to the Christmas spiri.

716
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,859
And you still haven't patchd
things up with your famil.

717
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,818
They left me.

718
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,945
You left them long ag.

719
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,698
Yeah, well, those cars aren't
stolen, I have the titles.

720
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,909
Oh, all freh
and brand-ne?

721
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,035
They're fake.

722
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,286
I don't believe it.

723
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,496
(fingers snap)

724
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,373
Believe this.

725
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,084
I'm very busy up at
the North Pole right now

726
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,795
and I don't have time to come
down here and set you straight.

727
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,881
Fly right, Covington,
or else.

728
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,299
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,675
I'll be watching you.

730
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,725
I don't listen to
no stinkin' elves.

731
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,731
I better tell him.

732
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,067
Teddy?

733
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,570
(footsteps approaching)

734
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,988
Yes, Mom.

735
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,324
I left a phone message
for your father

736
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,742
telling him
we're moving to Phoenix

737
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,077
to live with your grandmother.

738
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,413
We're leaving tomorrow.

739
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,039
On Christmas Day?

740
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,749
Yeah.

741
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,709
What about Margo?

742
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,795
Will I ever see her again?

743
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,047
We can come back and visit.

744
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,341
Teddy, you can
always stay here.

745
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,886
Why can't you two
work things out?

746
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,184
We've tried.

747
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,228
Try harder!

748
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,737
(distant dog barking)

749
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,201
He'll get over it.

750
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,922
Now, the Volkswagen
is a people's car.

751
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,382
But the Volvo
makes it worth it.

752
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,425
Excuse me.
Hi there.

753
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,303
Hi.
Does the key fit that car?

754
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,637
Let's see.

755
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,310
Let's see if you're going
to win a free car!

756
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,689
Okay.

757
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,324
Oh, rats.

758
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,658
Darn.

759
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,786
I guess that's
the way it goes.

760
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,624
Would you like me to show you
any other cars?

761
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,501
Uh, no.
I'll, um, look around.

762
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,837
Thanks.

763
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,346
Hello there.

764
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,598
Low miles on this one.

765
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,183
I'm not really
Santa Claus, kid.

766
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,185
Go bug your parents,
they're over there somewhere.

767
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,063
Look how straight it is,
never been in an accident.

768
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,356
What's the gas mileage?

769
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,941
Well, it's a small car
so it gets good mileage,

770
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,193
even in the city.
What?!

771
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,277
Teddy!

772
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,904
We need to talk.

773
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,280
This way.

774
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,452
Hey! Does the key fit
in that car?

775
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,120
Get lost!

776
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,123
Jerk.

777
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,585
You're sure
you don't want any pizza?

778
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,170
For some reason,

779
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,173
the only thing I want nowadays
is Christmas food.

780
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,551
Mom says we're moving in
with Grandma.

781
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,388
You're going to Phoenix?

782
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,558
She saw one of
your commercials.

783
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,726
Didn't like it, huh?

784
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,436
Why can't you just
say you're sorry

785
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,355
and make everything right?

786
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,149
Because what
I'm trying to do here

787
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,985
is make a better life
for all of us.

788
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,237
She should be able
to see that and support me.

789
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,030
I shouldn't have to be
sorry about it.

790
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,573
We're leaving
Christmas morning.

791
00:42:56,573 --> 00:43:00,035
She wasn't even
going to tell me.

792
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,996
She left you a message.

793
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,208
Listen,
all I can say is that

794
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,751
after this Christmas
sale is over,

795
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,003
I'll set everything right.

796
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,422
But for now, I have to
continue on my course.

797
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,757
It's the manly thing to do.

798
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,967
(sighing)

799
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,052
Guess I better
call your mother.

800
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,948
Hi, Mom.

801
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,992
Hi, sweetie.

802
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,368
Come on, Teddy.

803
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,788
I'm sure your mother and Gordon
would like to speak in private.

804
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,956
Bye, Dad.

805
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,960
You're 20 minutes late.

806
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,838
Well, at least I wasn't
supposedly watching our son

807
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,506
when he biked across town!

808
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,427
So how are things?

809
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,553
Fine.

810
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,764
Oh, I saw
your commercial.

811
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,974
Do you have any pride
left at all?

812
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,184
Good-bye.

813
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,062
Please watch our son
so he doesn't bike off

814
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,313
in the middle of the night.

815
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,148
Well, if he had a father
that was a father

816
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,609
instead of a full-time clown,
he might not be so impelled.

817
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,861
Oh, so now I'm a clown.

818
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,488
I'm Santa Claus!

819
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,822
Santa Clown.

820
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,742
Well, this Santa Clown is gonna
be CEO of Slykes Used Cars.

821
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,037
Yeah, well this mother is
taking her son to Phoenix.

822
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,663
Phoenix?
To your folks?

823
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:28,248
You don't even like your dad.

824
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,918
He's dead, Gordon.
Thanks for noticing.

825
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,922
Fine.
Go to Phoenix.

826
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,139
I'm running out of room,
Ambrose.

827
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,933
But you got to keep
the cars moving.

828
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,644
I'm bringing in
five more tonight.

829
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,687
Now look,
Eric in Van Nuys

830
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:53,190
has got the same size
lot you have

831
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,858
and he's not
having any trouble.

832
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,320
I've never sold cars
so fast.

833
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,031
Well, if I don't
drop them off here,

834
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,367
I-- I guess I'll have
to give them to Eric.

835
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,161
See what I mean
about those titles?

836
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,206
Do I deliver these
to Eric?

837
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,796
No, I guess I'll just have
to find a place for them.

838
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,470
Maybe we can use the parking lot
at the kids' recreation center.

839
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,931
Mrs. Sanders would probably
understand.

840
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,809
I'm warning you.
Stay away from this guy.

841
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,394
That's a great idea.

842
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,438
We can take over
the entire place.

843
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,483
We can... evict them.

844
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,569
No, no, I don't know
about that.

845
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,654
No, no.
It's brilliant.

846
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,990
I knew you had
the killer instinct.

847
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,785
Come on, let's go give those
rugrats the bad news.

848
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,205
(Lilith)
Gordon.
Well, okay.

849
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,373
Gordon!

850
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,751
Okay, Mr. Slykes.

851
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,566
(boy)
Ow!

852
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,371
(woman)
Once upon a time,
a long time ago,

853
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,459
there was a little boy
by the name of Franklin

854
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,295
but he was very, very slow.

855
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,547
And he had no hair.

856
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:44,134
Good afternoon, Mr. Slykes,
Mr. Covington.

857
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,637
What a Santa Claus suit.

858
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,305
Maybe you could
come by and...

859
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,806
(Slykes)
Pack it up, baby.

860
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,058
You and your little
street urchins

861
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,768
are getting the heave-ho.

862
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,564
Eviction.

863
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,359
What?
It's Christmas Eve.

864
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,027
I guess so.

865
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,949
What did we do wrong?

866
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,706
You can't go through
with this.

867
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,000
It's going to go on
with or without me.

868
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,670
Some of the children here
have no other safe place

869
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,046
to spend their time.

870
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,340
Aw.
What do I look like?

871
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,008
Father Flanagan?

872
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,677
I'm a businessman.

873
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,012
Read it and weep.

874
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,063
Teddy!

875
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,028
Margo?

876
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,530
We have to go to
the rec. center.

877
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,532
You're dad's about
to throw everybody out.

878
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,284
Let's go!

879
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,620
Maybe there's some way
you-- you'd reconsider?

880
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,663
No way.

881
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,832
You can't let him
go through with this.

882
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,958
Look, he's my boss.

883
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,376
He's got his mind
set on it.

884
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,546
I've never had to work with
a Secret Santa worse than you

885
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,881
and I've dealt with several
on Alcatraz.

886
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:07,593
Gordon, stop talking to yourself
and get your butt over here.

887
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,682
Now, all we need is
your signature.

888
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,813
(electrical charge)

889
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,738
What just happened?

890
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,157
I couldn't let you
go through with it.

891
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,366
Where are we?

892
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:36,872
Your house,
Christmas morning, 1967.

893
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,415
Have a look.

894
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,754
Have a look.

895
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,923
Merry Christmas,
sweetheart.

896
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,759
Merry Christmas, son.

897
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,761
(Lilith)
You don't recognize this room,

898
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,720
these people?

899
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,139
It's me
and my parents.

900
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,766
Why are we here?

901
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,435
Get a grip, Greedy.
You'll see.

902
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,271
Come on.

903
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,691
Boots?

904
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,904
I wanted a train.

905
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,785
Son, this world is full
of suckers and winners.

906
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,703
I want you to be a winner.

907
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:20,332
A toy train isn't going
to get you anywhere in life,

908
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:24,127
but with good pair of boots,
you can start working.

909
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,546
Shoveling snow,
mowing lawns,

910
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,881
making money.

911
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,341
He's only a boy.

912
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,885
The sooner he learns the meaning
of a buck, the better.

913
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,889
Can't you see I'm trying to
teach him the lessons of life?

914
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,350
I wanted a train.

915
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,189
I really wanted
that train.

916
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,859
Those were
perfectly fine boots.

917
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,486
Last year
you gave him a shovel.

918
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,447
It was a perfectly
fine shovel.

919
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,032
If you don't change
your ways, Gordon.

920
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:57,828
Teddy will be saying the same
thing to his children.

921
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,539
Change, Gordon.

922
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,791
Now come on.

923
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,837
"Dear Santa Claus,

924
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,632
"All I want for Christmas
is my dad to believe in you.

925
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,469
"If he did, he would understand
the spirit of Christmas

926
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,389
"and might be nicer
to everyone,

927
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,974
"including me and my mom.

928
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,685
"Please help him find
the spirit of Christmas.

929
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,770
Love, Teddy."

930
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,689
See what you're doing?

931
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,858
How can I make it up
to him?

932
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:28,942
Change.

933
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,068
Change?
How?

934
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,237
I've only known one way
since I was a kid.

935
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,321
Exactly.

936
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,449
Just as your father
taught you,

937
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,616
as you are teaching Teddy,

938
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,368
and as Teddy will teach
his children.

939
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,536
Change, Gordon.

940
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,456
I'm a used car salesman,
died and caste.

941
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,374
I cornered
the market on used bikes

942
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,084
when I was about his age.

943
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,586
I'm a bottom-line guy.

944
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,797
The bottom line, Gordon, isn't
how many cars you sell

945
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,841
or the job title
that you're striving for,

946
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:56,219
it's the love that your family
members have for each other.

947
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,220
They love me.

948
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,597
They're leaving you,
Gordon.

949
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,308
And all you'll have
is an empty house.

950
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,350
Come on.

951
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,643
You don't really think
she's going

952
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,353
to take
Teddy away, do you?

953
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,521
What do you think?

954
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,232
This is your moment,
Gordon.

955
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,026
It's all up to you.

956
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,446
I never believed it
would come to this.

957
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,407
Now I know what I must do.

958
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,081
Hey.

959
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,917
Here.
Just sign it, kid.

960
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,960
Then I'll take you over
to The Pink Monkey

961
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,129
and we'll celebrate.
You know why?

962
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,631
Uh, uh, no.

963
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,383
Because I'm giving you
the CEO job right now.

964
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,552
Now come on,
let's get it over with.

965
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,428
Sign it.

966
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,055
Sign it.
Sign away.

967
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,681
Don't do it, Dad!

968
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,643
Teddy.

969
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,937
Will you sign the eviction
notice already?!

970
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,814
Don't sign it, Dad.

971
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,274
Please, you can't close
this place down.

972
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,070
No, no.

973
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,697
I can't.
I can't evict these kids!

974
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,825
What?
Here, give me that.

975
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,076
Thank goodness!

976
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,496
Mr. Slykes,
the real bottom line

977
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,790
is the love you share
with your family.

978
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,834
Have you gone
crackers, kid?

979
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,628
Furthermore, I think those
cars that Louie and Donny

980
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,588
are bringing to the lot
are stolen.

981
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,927
We'll be right back.

982
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,554
Come on, kids.

983
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,097
I'll order pizza.

984
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,307
I think my dad's in trouble.

985
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,060
We're on it.

986
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,620
Well, get him out of the car.

987
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,080
He's lost it.

988
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,333
Started shooting off his mouth
about our little operation.

989
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,003
You can't do this to me!

990
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,337
I'm a Secret Santa.

991
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,631
You're sure fat enough
to be Santa Claus.

992
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,341
You ever seen the way
this guy eats?

993
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,509
Look, just tie him up.

994
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,595
Then see if you can find
his lot lizard.

995
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,014
We're going to have
to nix this whole operation.

996
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,975
Get down.
Get down.

997
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,020
Unhand me!
I'm Santa Claus!

998
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,354
Ah, shut up!

999
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,231
You'll get nothing in your
stocking this year, young man.

1000
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,524
I'm telling you.
Oh shut up, Merry.

1001
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,234
What are they gonna
do with my dad?

1002
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,402
I don't know.

1003
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,490
What's wrong with you?

1004
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,617
Let's call the cops.

1005
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,035
That wouldn't be
a good idea right now.

1006
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,953
You're dad could get
into a lot of trouble

1007
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,914
for selling stolen cars.

1008
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,081
Stolen cars.

1009
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,416
Slykes set us up.

1010
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,543
I check the titles he's been
giving us with the DMV

1011
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,753
and they're phonies.

1012
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,630
I'll have to go in there
myself if I have to.

1013
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,714
Easy, cowboy.

1014
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,965
I gotta to think
this one through.

1015
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,884
I'll tell you one more time.

1016
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,427
I'm a Secret Santa.

1017
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,888
I'm helping Santa deliver
presents this year.

1018
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,389
There's an elf
that's helping me.

1019
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,558
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,727
Holiday nog's done rot
his brain, boss.

1021
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,228
(chuckles)

1022
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,731
Well, whatever it is,

1023
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,900
his big mouth isn't
gonna put me in jail.

1024
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,277
As a matter of fact,
you're gonna take the rap.

1025
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,612
(mumbling)

1026
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,823
Now here.

1027
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,242
Here's a list of all the cars
that were stolen

1028
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,577
from the retirement village.

1029
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,663
Only in this
revised version,

1030
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,958
only you and Donny
are in on the scam.

1031
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,167
Hey, hey, hey!

1032
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,337
Are you guys trying
to double-cross me?

1033
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,130
Sorry, Donny.

1034
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,302
(cuffs clicking)

1035
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,179
(Slykes)
We gotta clear our tracks.

1036
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,236
Put him in
the back of the car.

1037
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,029
All right, we'll take him
to the warehouse,

1038
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,448
then I'll figure out
what to do next.

1039
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,807
What are you doing
with my dad?

1040
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,350
Kirk, you're fired.

1041
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,393
I quit.

1042
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,853
And you.
You little brats.

1043
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,813
You call the cops
and I'll deny everything.

1044
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,314
And then I'll come
and get you.

1045
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:21,651
Kirk, anybody calls the cop,
you're in big trouble, buddy.

1046
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,903
I'm already wanted
in 49 states.

1047
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,071
I'm out of here.

1048
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,656
What about my dad?
He'll-- he'll be okay.

1049
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,922
I thought
I'd find you here.

1050
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,799
Mom, they've
kidnapped dad.

1051
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,801
Right, and they're holding him
for a million-dollar ransom.

1052
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,387
Teddy, I told you I don't
want you hanging around here.

1053
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,889
Mom, I'm telling
the truth.

1054
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,932
Margo, I suggest
you go home right now.

1055
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,434
Teddy, get in the car.

1056
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,560
But what about my bike?

1057
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,062
We'll come
and pick it up later.

1058
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,189
Get in the car.

1059
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,316
But Mom,
I'm telling the truth.

1060
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,699
(Gordon screaming)
Ahh!

1061
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,959
(groaning)

1062
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,174
(shuddering)

1063
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,221
Ah, oh...

1064
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,334
Where is he?

1065
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,336
I don't know.

1066
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,046
You idiot.

1067
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,515
(Gordon shivering)

1068
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,334
I certainly have made
a mess out of things.

1069
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,212
I should have listened to that
elf when I had a chance.

1070
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,382
I should've paid
more attention to my family...

1071
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,134
been there when
they needed me.

1072
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,928
Now I may never see them again.

1073
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,391
I just need one more chance.

1074
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,186
One chance to make
things right.

1075
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,402
Oh...

1076
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,321
(owl)
Who?

1077
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,573
Why, why, why, me,
of course.

1078
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,325
Who said that?

1079
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,328
(owl)
Over here.

1080
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,413
Youse lost your way?

1081
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,333
You're-- you're an owl!
A talking owl!

1082
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,793
Yeah, right,
and you're Santa Claus.

1083
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,338
No, I just look like him.

1084
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,673
Duh! So what are youse
doing out here?

1085
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,926
I don't know.
Where am I?

1086
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,762
The North Pole, of course.
Ya cold?

1087
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,263
Yeah.
Freezing.

1088
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,349
Yeah, I know.
That's tough.

1089
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,017
Can you help me?

1090
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,310
I don't think so.

1091
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,645
You're Gordy Covington,
right?

1092
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,104
Yes.
Yes, I am.

1093
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,856
Sorry, pal,
the word's out on you.

1094
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:50,193
Nobody gives a hoot one way or
another what happens to you.

1095
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,570
I've done some rotten things.

1096
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,197
Yeah, a lot of things.

1097
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,616
Okay, a lot of rotten things.

1098
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,369
But I've changed.
I've seen the light.

1099
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,162
All I need is another
chance to prove

1100
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,747
I'm not the old
Gordon I used to be.

1101
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,375
Well, it's no mouse in my craw
either way, pally,

1102
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,294
but if you keep moving north
you'll come to Santy's place.

1103
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,420
Will he help me?

1104
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,339
Well, I wouldn't,
but then he's known

1105
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,674
to be soft on mooks
like you.

1106
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,550
Give it a try,
what have you got to lose?

1107
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,220
You're right.
North you say?

1108
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,554
Straight ahead.

1109
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:19,597
Thanks.

1110
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,057
Yeah, whatever.

1111
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,309
(sighing)

1112
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,535
Hmm, oh.

1113
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,580
Hey, hey--

1114
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,541
Hmm.

1115
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,252
North Pole, huh.
See ya.

1116
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:00,263
What a mess
I've made of things.

1117
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:04,142
How could I have ever
been so blind?

1118
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,606
I rented a cabin
for Christmas.

1119
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:13,109
Snowboarding,
snowball fights, the works.

1120
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,111
Yes!
My first white Christmas.

1121
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,529
That's right.

1122
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,907
Take it.
Just take it, kid.

1123
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,035
I'd feel better
if you did.

1124
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,162
Okay, I'll do it.

1125
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,498
But if one of those llamas
bites my kid, I'll sue.

1126
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,168
I had to go the NASCAR races
last year.

1127
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,337
Ambrose invited me,
I couldn't say no.

1128
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,297
It was-- it was business.

1129
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,258
I'll dress up
like Santa Claus.

1130
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,844
My Christmas play is
tonight at 7:00.

1131
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,471
I'll be there.

1132
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:46,184
I don't listen to
no stinkin' elves.

1133
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,312
Hey! Does the key fit
in that car?

1134
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,147
Get lost!

1135
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,816
Do I deliver these
to Eric?

1136
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,945
No, I guess I'll just have
to find a place for them.

1137
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,114
Are we going for sure
this year?

1138
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:03,576
Of course, I promise.

1139
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,666
Ah...

1140
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,293
Hello, Earth to Santa.

1141
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,170
Uh,
I'm not Santa Claus.

1142
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,505
I just look like him.

1143
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,714
Yeah, right.

1144
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,966
You've got the beard,
you've got the hat,

1145
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,218
and like you're fat.

1146
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,427
I haven't always
been fat.

1147
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,513
Listen, one minute I'm
in the trunk of a car,

1148
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,681
the next minute I'm walking
through the forest.

1149
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:27,308
I don't even know
where I am.

1150
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,936
Oh, you're
a Secret Santa.

1151
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,438
Chapter ten
in the elf manual.

1152
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,857
I knew I should have
read that.

1153
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,360
Great, I'm with an elf
and she doesn't know

1154
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,569
where we are either.

1155
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,696
Look, I may be
an elf in training

1156
01:01:40,696 --> 01:01:43,908
and you may be a Secret Santa
but, hey, you know what,

1157
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,993
let's go find out about
this place to get her.

1158
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,871
Okay, lead the way.
Let's go.

1159
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:52,917
What's this?

1160
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,585
Why, the mine shaft,
of course.

1161
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,045
Mine shaft?

1162
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,298
Where do you think all those
lumps of coal come from, huh?

1163
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,884
Oh, I got a lot of those
when I was a little kid.

1164
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,052
I bet you did.

1165
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,429
Come on, let's go.

1166
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,847
Okay.

1167
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,937
And this is the place where
Santa makes all his

1168
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,814
Christmas treats
for the good little boys

1169
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,691
and good little girls
of the world.

1170
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,109
Oh, boy!

1171
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,194
Hey, you!
You're fat enough already.

1172
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:22,530
Come on, let's go.
Okay.

1173
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,369
Well, this is it.

1174
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,079
This is the end
of the road for me.

1175
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,998
You're on your own
from here on out.

1176
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,958
Well,
what is this place?

1177
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:37,044
This is the place where
you'll get all the answers.

1178
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,843
The only problem is
I can never figure out

1179
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,595
how to get this door open.

1180
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,680
(door rattling)

1181
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,265
Maybe we should just knock.

1182
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,684
(gasps)
What a great idea.

1183
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,894
Bye-bye.

1184
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,520
Bye-bye.

1185
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,448
Whoo, whoo.
Hurry up, hurry up.

1186
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,616
Whoo.
Whew.

1187
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,035
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

1188
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,786
I've changed.
Mmm.

1189
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:12,997
I told you I would.
Mmm-hmm.

1190
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:15,082
Hmm, hmm.

1191
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,587
(chuckling)

1192
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,963
I'm impressed.

1193
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,840
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1194
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,970
(wind whistling)

1195
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,263
Where am I?

1196
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,473
Santa Claus's home.

1197
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,725
Really?!
Yeah.

1198
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,686
Give me a hand.

1199
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,151
Eh, eh.
Wipe your feet!

1200
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,154
You'll have the missis
on my case.

1201
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,323
Come on,
I'll give you the tour.

1202
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:55,122
How do I know
this isn't a dream?

1203
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:58,042
Ow!
Oh, it's not a dream.

1204
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,253
Is he here?

1205
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,671
The man?

1206
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,006
Yeah.
He's in bed.

1207
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,174
He's old.

1208
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,725
Check this out.

1209
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,021
What is this?

1210
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,523
It's a signature book...

1211
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,234
of all the people who have
been Secret Santas.

1212
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:26,571
You didn't think Santa could
deliver presents by himself.

1213
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,947
Guess not.

1214
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,740
These folks were asked to do
what you're doing.

1215
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,661
Santa isn't a single person,
he's a spirit of good will.

1216
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,581
Think what life would be
like without Christmas.

1217
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,709
No fruitcake and eggnog.

1218
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,960
Just kidding.

1219
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,712
Think of all the love that
otherwise would not

1220
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,339
be expressed
if we didn't have Christmas.

1221
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:47,883
Yeah.

1222
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:48,926
Go ahead.

1223
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,720
Sign your name.

1224
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,119
♪

1225
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,313
Andrew Stevens.

1226
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,567
Andrew Stevens.
Ugh.

1227
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,779
Very naughty this year.

1228
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,906
(thunder rumbling)

1229
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,374
Every letter
sent to Santa is read.

1230
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,627
The child's request is recorded
by the register

1231
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,212
and checked off by zip code.

1232
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,256
You mean Santa doesn't
read every letter?

1233
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,676
Between you and me,
no, he doesn't.

1234
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:15,429
I mean, two and a half million
letters a year and rising.

1235
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,390
The man is old.

1236
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,650
(girls)
Howdy, Secret Santa!

1237
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,360
(Gordon)
Ho, ho, ho!

1238
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,820
Merry Christmas!

1239
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,656
(girls)
Merry Christmas!

1240
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:40,538
(computer beeping)

1241
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,170
This is our monitoring room.

1242
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,799
Where we really find out who
was naughty and who was nice.

1243
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,764
We have many of these rooms
spread throughout the home.

1244
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,224
Wow.

1245
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,783
Of course!
I can you a big discount.

1246
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,410
Secretly,
I own the place.

1247
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,496
That old guy, Slykes,
he's just a front
for tax purposes.

1248
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:25,374
Oh!
That's so exciting!

1249
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,378
(Gordon)
Wow! Santa really does know.

1250
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:33,007
(beeping)

1251
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,925
Whoa, it's late.

1252
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,052
We gotta get you
in a magic Santa suit.

1253
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:39,180
Let's roll.

1254
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,283
Let's rock.

1255
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,665
Your ride.

1256
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,001
No reindeer?

1257
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,879
Their union was too hard
to negotiate with.

1258
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,219
Uh, I don't think I have a
license to drive this thing.

1259
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,888
Don't worry.
It's programmed.

1260
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:26,727
This is your show.

1261
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,854
I'm just here
to supervise.

1262
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,107
This is miniature gift-location
and disbursement finder.

1263
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:33,859
Called a MINI for short.

1264
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,320
The LCD readout will
automatically tell you

1265
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,155
which presents go under
what tree.

1266
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,615
Where are the presents?

1267
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,367
They're in here!

1268
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,494
Are you kidding?

1269
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,121
It's huge in there.

1270
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,290
I know.
Let's roll.

1271
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,710
Oh, you still have to say,
"Onward Dasher

1272
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,087
"and Dancer, on Prancer

1273
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:56,590
"and Vixen, on Comet, on Cupid,
on Donner and Blitzen.

1274
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,468
And Rudolph!"

1275
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,353
(wind whistling)

1276
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,491
Okay.
Check your MINI.

1277
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,826
Our first house
is coming up.

1278
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,955
Okay, a baseball bat
and a pair of roller blades.

1279
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,878
One baseball bat...

1280
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,797
and, uh, roller blades?

1281
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:40,342
Yeah, I remember
wrapping that one.

1282
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,177
Aren't we going to land?

1283
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:46,891
No, when I say the word,
just throw them overboard.

1284
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,893
Okay!

1285
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,644
Okay.

1286
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,859
(growling)

1287
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,739
I don't understand
how this works.

1288
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:02,907
Don't worry.

1289
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,992
The presents, they made it
right down the chimney.

1290
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:08,037
Most of our sleighs are
PGDS-equipped.

1291
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,204
PGDS?

1292
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:11,749
Precision Gift
Delivery System.

1293
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,044
A couple of our elves
at MIT developed it.

1294
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,965
Okay, check your MINI.

1295
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,426
We only have four seconds
between chimneys.

1296
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,053
This one gets a puppy.

1297
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,971
A puppy?!

1298
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:32,770
Oh...

1299
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,356
Good luck, little fella.

1300
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,450
Okay.

1301
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,246
If that's it, do you think

1302
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:52,623
we could go through
a drive-thru?

1303
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,832
I'm starving.

1304
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,876
It's Christmas Eve, Santa.
Everything's closed.

1305
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,211
Not in Vegas!

1306
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,797
We're not done yet.
Check your MINI.

1307
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,632
265 Rochester?!

1308
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:05,135
That's right.
Your sister-in-law's.

1309
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:08,055
We're gonna do this
the old-school way.

1310
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,307
With pleasure.

1311
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,854
(siren blaring, horn honking)

1312
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,985
Oh!
(laughing)

1313
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,486
(sighing)

1314
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,781
You know...

1315
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,992
I never dressed up
like Santa Claus for Teddy.

1316
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,703
We never set cookies out
or anything.

1317
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,455
I thought they would
just get stale.

1318
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,250
Well, now you know better.

1319
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,672
Here's a little something.

1320
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,467
A little gift from me.
(chuckles)

1321
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,386
Thanks.

1322
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,762
Thanks a lot.

1323
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,144
(whispers)
Good luck, Santa.

1324
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,603
Thanks.

1325
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,443
You're gonna do just fine.

1326
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,819
Thanks.

1327
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,490
Yup.

1328
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,118
Gonna do just fine.

1329
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,248
♪

1330
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:42,441
Merry Christmas, Teddy.

1331
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,693
Santa's here.

1332
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,861
Dad?

1333
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,906
Santa Claus?

1334
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:54,203
They made me
a Santa Claus, son.

1335
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,040
It
 you.

1336
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,167
Santa Claus does exist!

1337
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,585
You were right.

1338
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:05,589
Say, would you like to ride
in Santa's sleigh?

1339
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,632
Yeah!

1340
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,218
First, I have
something for you.

1341
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,932
Tickets to Aspen.

1342
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,893
We are gonna have a white
Christmas after all.

1343
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,353
Thanks, Dad.

1344
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,482
Come on, let's go.

1345
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,026
We've got 15 minutes
to get to Tokyo.

1346
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,319
Okay.

1347
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,912
Wow!

1348
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,497
Cool sleigh.

1349
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,415
And... a real elf?

1350
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:41,959
Yes, thank you.

1351
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:45,087
See, he knows better than
to call me a leprechaun.

1352
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:48,590
Santa, head due south.

1353
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,467
We got a score
to settle.

1354
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:51,927
(all)
Whoa!

1355
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,556
Yeah, I-- I know
it's Christmas Eve,

1356
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,849
but I got a great idea.

1357
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,101
You want a promotion,
don't you?

1358
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,478
Look, I'm moving
to Palm Springs.

1359
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,897
I need somebody to run
all my lots for me.

1360
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,108
I had a bad feeling
about him.

1361
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,317
I should have listened to it.

1362
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,194
What are you gonna do
about it now?

1363
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,113
Will you watch my back?

1364
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,406
Of course.

1365
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:18,495
Hold on.

1366
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,622
What's taking you
so long, stupid?

1367
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,458
Well, boss, they don't make
these cars like they used to.

1368
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,419
They're a lot harder
to steal.

1369
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,546
Now, listen...

1370
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:31,008
Merry Christmas, Ambrose.

1371
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,469
The office party
is over there, Santa.

1372
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,220
You've been a bad boy!

1373
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,513
Well, haven't we all.

1374
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,144
(groaning)

1375
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,271
Bye, Santa.
I'm busy.

1376
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,814
Well, I'm just
getting started.

1377
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,858
(electrical charge)

1378
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,780
No one messes
with the Claus.

1379
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,658
You really are
Santa Claus?

1380
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,953
I thought you were just
in kids' books.

1381
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,079
Wrong again.

1382
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,207
And I know what you did
to Gordon Covington.

1383
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:05,584
Gordon who?

1384
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,920
Dangled a promotion
in front of him.

1385
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,838
Pushed stolen cars on him.

1386
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,175
Oh, that Gordon Covington.

1387
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,676
Well, I know him.

1388
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,054
You only thought
you did, kid.

1389
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,639
Ambrose?
Yeah, Santa.

1390
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:22,351
You're only getting one thing
for Christmas this year.

1391
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,769
A stretch in the pokey.

1392
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:27,022
Oh, in your dreams,
chubby!

1393
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,613
Ohh!
Ahh!

1394
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,866
Good assist, son.

1395
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,703
You know, if you'd only
given me

1396
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,872
the red wagon
I asked you for, Santa,

1397
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,166
I wouldn't have had
to steal one

1398
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,168
and go down
the path of crime.

1399
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:49,711
(Lilith)
You're lying.

1400
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,088
You got the red wagon.

1401
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,590
But you wanted a bigger one
with chrome wheels,

1402
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,133
so you went out and stole it.

1403
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:57,052
Here's to making
a fresh start.

1404
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,137
Let's try this again.

1405
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,363
(crying)
Oh, it's my little red wagon.

1406
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,457
(dialing)

1407
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,795
9-1-1?
This is Santa Claus.

1408
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:35,173
I'd like to report a crime
against the Christmas spirit.

1409
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:37,342
Yes, I'll hold.

1410
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:44,349
Uh, Merry Christmas, boss.

1411
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,562
Shut up.

1412
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:57,529
(whooping and laughter)

1413
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,656
Whoa!

1414
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,747
Whoa!

1415
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,082
(laughter)

1416
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,964
We better get you
back home now, son.

1417
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,341
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1418
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,925
(laughter)

1419
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:20,427
(all)
Whoa!

1420

Whoa.
Dad, that was awesome.

1422
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:26,892
I can't promise you
a sleigh ride every year.

1423
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,769
But I can promise you that
we are going to be

1424
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,021
a much happier
family from here on out.

1425
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:34,107
Okay, I won't promise,
I'll just prove it.

1426
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:36,109
I know you will, Dad.
I love you.

1427
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:37,444
I love you too, son.

1428
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:41,865
See you tomorrow.

in my eye.

1434

Onward.

1437

Oh, no.

1438
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,361
I forgot to tell Dad
we're leaving

1439
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,154
for Phoenix tomorrow morning.

1440
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:23,198
Teddy, what are
you doing up?

1441
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,785
Uh, I was...
er... thirsty.

Okay?
Okay.

Now you get
back in bed.

1445
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,375
Okay.

1446
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:37,671
Santa can get here
without any of your help.

1447
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,798
Good night.
Good night.

1448
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,689
I wish I could
keep the sleigh.

1449
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,901
You can't.

1450
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,279
The last thing to take care of
is the meeting.

1451

01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,906
With him.

1453
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,412
This is the end of the line
for you and me.

I know I've been
a pain in the neck,

1455

worth your while.

Santa Claus.

the spirit of Christmas

for a night.

1469

But there's one more request
I have to make of you.

1470
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:14,100
When you go back
to your life,

1471
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,522
don't leave the spirit of
Christmas just in your mind.

1472
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:23,443
Carry it with you
every day and act on it.

1473
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:31,117
Now go and just have
a wonderful life.

1474
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:33,161
I will.
