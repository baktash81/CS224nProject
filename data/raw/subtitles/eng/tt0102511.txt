1
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,778
Exterminator.

2
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,737
You want I should spit
right in your face?

3
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,578
- You want? You want?
- I ran out.

4
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:01,625
You ran out? Oh, that's nice.

5
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,385
It's impossible you run out!
What'd you do, eat the stuff?

6
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,015
The Chink shortchanged me.

7
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,688
No glot. Come Fliday.

8
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:20,872
It's funny. It's actual very
funny what you just said.

9
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,334
Ran out.

10
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,006
They can either paint it,
or draw it, or write it down

11
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,928
and then pass it on to somebody.
They read what you're saying,

12
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:29,515
and then they reexperience.

13
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,686
That's the only connection
you have with that.

14
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,982
So you can't rewrite,

15
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,113
'cause to rewrite is to deceive and lie,

16
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:40,829
and you betray your own
thoughts. To rethink the flow

17
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:45,380
and the rhythm and the tumbling
out of the words... is a betrayal.

18
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:48,135
And it's a sin, Martin. It's a sin.

19
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:51,726
I don't accept your
Catholic interpretation

20
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:55,150
of my compulsive, necessity to rewrite

21
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:58,322
every single word at
least a hundred times.

22
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:01,663
Guilt is... Thanks.
Guilt is the key, not sin.

23
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,878
Guilt re not writing
the best that I can.

24
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:09,512
Guilt re not considering everything
from every possible angle.

25
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,348
Balancing everything.

26
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:16,109
How about guilt re
censoring your best thoughts?

27
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:19,781
Your most honest,
primitive, real thoughts.

28
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:23,539
Because that's what your laborious
rewriting amounts to, Martin.

29
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,753
Is rewriting really censorship, Bill?

30
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,883
Because I'm completely fucked if it is.

31
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:32,432
Exterminate all rational thought.

32
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,689
That is the conclusion I have come to.

33
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:38,737
What is the man talking
about? I'm being serious.

34
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,907
So is he.

35
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,916
So how is the extermination
business going there, Bill?

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,009
Somebody's stealing my roach
powder. Somebody's got it in for me.

37
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:53,016
Bill, maybe you should
take it as a sign.

38
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,394
Maybe you ought to try your
hand at writing pornography.

39
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,027
Yeah, a novel a week at 120
bucks. It's serious money.

40
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,325
I can connect you with the guy.

41
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,703
We're thinking of
collaborating on one ourselves.

42
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,708
I gave up writing when I was 10.

43
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,675
- Too dangerous.
- Only if someone reads what you write.

44
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,390
So far we haven't had that problem.

45
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,813
- I've found my profession. I'm an exterminator.
- Of course, Bill.

46
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,984
That's just what the world needs
more literate exterminators.

47
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:22,031
Give me a cigarette.

48
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:27,459
Of course, then, you know...

49
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:29,212
you're gonna have trouble

50
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,968
if you can't keep track
of your roach powder.

51
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,405
Wait a minute. Do you boys
know something about this?

52
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:44,702
We don't exactly know anything.

53
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:48,919
No, but we suspect
it's a domestic problem.

54
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:25,826
- My God, what are you doing?
- You weren't supposed to see this.

55
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:29,374
Well, now that I'm
seeing it, what is it?

56
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:33,507
I'm shooting up your bug powder.

57
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,350
You might like to try it
yourself. Or you might not.

58
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:41,441
I ran out in the middle of a job.

59
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:47,493
You gotta stop using the stuff, Joan.

60
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:49,540
They ration it out like snakebite serum.

61
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:54,467
Just do what everybody else
does, cut it with baby laxative.

62
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,016
The roaches will shit
themselves to death.

63
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,479
It's the best job I ever had.

64
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:03,359
If I run out again, I'm finished.

65
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,749
It's...

66
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:17,804
It's a very literary
high. Very literary.

67
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,101
Is that why Hank and
Martin know all about it?

68
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:25,569
We all just tried it
together-spur of the moment thing.

69
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:27,741
They didn't like it, I did.

70
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,294
What do you mean, it's a literary high?

71
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:37,970
It's a Kafka high. You feel like a bug.

72
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,565
Try some.

73
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:48,533
Well, I don't know.

74
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,961
I don't know.

75
00:08:56,966 --> 00:09:00,055
I think our metabolisms
are very different.

76
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,728
Whose? Yours and Kafka's?

77
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:07,070
I thought you were finished
with doing weird stuff.

78
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:12,331
I thought I was, too,
but I guess I'm not.

79
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:22,893
Personally... I prefer a
pyrethrum job to a fluoride.

80
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:26,524
With the pyrethrum you
kill the roaches right there

81
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,489
in front of God and the client

82
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,161
whereas this starch and fluoride...

83
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,665
leave it around, the roaches eat it...

84
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:37,338
come back a few days later,
they're running around fat as hogs.

85
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,639
And there it is, Bill. You
want to put on some weight,

86
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:45,564
you gotta switch from that
yellow powder diet of yours

87
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:48,987
to some of this good
fluoride stuff right here.

88
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,327
Sure works for the Chink.
He's healthy enough.

89
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,041
You see him scarf that poison down?

90
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,093
He doesn't really eat
it. It's sleight of hand.

91
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:01,469
The hell he doesn't.

92
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:03,934
Been breathing in the powder so
long, it just makes him laugh.

93
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,731
Just like them roaches.

94
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:21,886
William Lee.

95
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,691
- What is this?
- He's Hauser. I'm O'Brien.

96
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,321
City Narcotics. We're gonna
take you downtown, Bill.

97
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:35,914
Little matter of possession
of a dangerous substance.

98
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,723
You've got quite a record, Bill.

99
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:48,439
A lot of drugs poured down the old vein.

100
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,864
I was a troubled person then.
I'm married now. Got a good job.

101
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,745
That's good, Bill. That's nice.

102
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,753
What's this, then?

103
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:02,592
That's my job. I use it to kill bugs.

104
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:05,890
- He says it kills bugs.
- He could be right.

105
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:10,231
- I'd like to see it.
- Me too. I'd like to see it, too.

106
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,403
Well, gee.

107
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:14,366
I'd like to demonstrate,

108
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,331
but I already got rid of
that last case of crabs I had.

109
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,545
Very funny, Bill.

110
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,177
But, you know...

111
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:29,103
- I think we got a bug around here somewhere.
- You're right.

112
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,278
Let's see if that yellow
stuff will kill it.

113
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:30,393
We'll be back later to see
how it worked out, kiddo.

114
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,073
Break a leg.

115
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:46,217
William Lee? I have arranged all this

116
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,348
just to have a moment alone with you.

117
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:52,186
I am your case officer.

118
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,360
- My what?
- Case officer.

119
00:12:55,443 --> 00:13:00,955
You are my agent. I, in turn,
report to your controller.

120
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:05,755
Come, come, Mr. Lee. You don't
have to play dumb with me.

121
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:13,521
- That would be foolish, wouldn't it?
- It would.

122
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:16,819
Say, Bill... do you think you could rub

123
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:20,118
some of this powder on my lips?

124
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,668
Yeah.

125
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,045
Sure.

126
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:41,993
Well, now. As you might have expected

127
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:47,046
I have instructions
for you from Control.

128
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:52,724
It's about the little woman.

129
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:59,320
- The what?
- The little woman. Your little woman.

130
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:03,120
- Your wife.
- Tell me.

131
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:07,421
Your wife is not really your wife.

132
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:11,345
She is an agent of
Interzone Incorporated.

133
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:15,436
You must kill her. Kill Joan Lee.

134
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,111
It must be done soon, this week.

135
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:22,993
And it must be done real tasty.

136
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,622
Interzone Incorporated?

137
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:27,919
An organization based in Interzone,

138
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:32,470
a notorious free port on
the North African coast.

139
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:36,478
A haven for the mongrel
scum of the Earth

140
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:40,820
an engorged parasite on
the underbelly of the West.

141
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:45,371
I can't see it. Why would a
classy American woman like Joan

142
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:50,006
ever want to work for a two-bit
outfit like Interzone Incorporated?

143
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,886
But who says Joan Lee is really a woman?

144
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:57,604
In fact, who says she's human at all?

145
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,530
- What do you mean by that?
- I can say no more.

146
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:12,133
Hey, where you going? Don't
do it. There'll be hell to pay.

147
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:18,224
We've been made. We
gotta get out of town.

148
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:20,395
Wait a minute.

149
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,029
- What's going on?
- I got busted for bug powder.

150
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,411
I started hallucinating
behind the stuff.

151
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,211
God knows what I really
said to those two flatfeet.

152
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:36,384
I'm not even sure how
I got out of there.

153
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:39,434
Did you bring back
tomorrow's bug powder?

154
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,898
Did you, Bill? Did you?

155
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:48,325
My God, Joan. You're acting
like a full-fledged junkie.

156
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,916
And it's bug powder, for Christ's sake!

157
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:11,037
I do have a little bit
of a habit, yes, hon.

158
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,171
You ought to at least give me
a few marks for originality.

159
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:18,135
How did you know it
just wouldn't kill you?

160
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:22,143
I don't know, Bill.

161
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:28,363
I felt drawn to it. You know?

162
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:34,126
Like you feel drawn... to an old lover.

163
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:39,219
Say, Bill...

164
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:42,726
could you rub some of
this powder on my lips?

165
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,488
Could you... Bill?

166
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:51,618
Please.

167
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,228
Hey!

168
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,695
Bill.

169
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:57,835
Where were you this morning?
We missed you at the Automat.

170
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:01,675
I... got in a bit of a jam.

171
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:05,308
I misplaced the gear,
in a manner of speaking.

172
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,187
We heard about it.

173
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,361
We saw you go off
with the heat, in fact.

174
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:16,580
They won't give it back to
Cohen. It's evidence, they say.

175
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:20,670
Yeah. It's an embarrassment, yes.

176
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:25,263
Is that why you tried to lift mine?

177
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:33,364
That's unkind, Edward."Lift" is unkind.

178
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:38,207
I'm doing a job for a friend.

179
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,378
The centipedes, Edward.

180
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,633
The centipedes are getting
down right arrogant.

181
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:47,935
- They're starting to attack his children.
- Take it from me, Bill.

182
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:52,569
You're not the first one to
develop a bug powder problem.

183
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:55,115
See this man.

184
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:57,746
He'll help ya.

185
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:03,591
Dr. A. Benway. General Practitioner.

186
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,930
Bug powder?

187
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,313
- You mean pyrethrum?
- Yes.

188
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:16,533
I get a lot of you folks
in the extermination trade.

189
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,957
You better help this friend of
yours get off the yellow stuff.

190
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,049
- It'll kill him.
- How do I get him to kick?

191
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,973
- Kick?
- How do I get him off it?

192
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,151
Mix it with this.

193
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:38,077
Gradually increase the percentage
of black without telling your friend

194
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,085
and he'll lose his taste for
the bug powder soon enough.

195
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:51,603
- What is it? What does it do?
- It's all natural.

196
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,569
It's made from, aquatic
Brazilian centipede

197
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:57,824
or some such outlandish thing.

198
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:01,456
It shuts down the brain's response
to the bug powder. That's all.

199
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,377
The powder becomes
irrelevant to the addict...

200
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,216
and the addict then
ceases to be addicted.

201
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,556
Side effects?

202
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,978
Nothing that will surprise the addict.

203
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,153
But, I before I do your cure

204
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,782
I've gotta score some bug powder.

205
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,913
Score?

206
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:26,881
You're not trying to... pull a
fast one on the old doctor, are you?

207
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:29,137
I came here for help.

208
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:32,185
Of course you did.

209
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:39,741
My God.

210
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:43,833
It smells like a... tainted cheese.

211
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,886
You'll see how elegantly this works.

212
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:53,770
The black will disappear completely.

213
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,917
And there'll be no
smell, no discoloration.

214
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,380
It's like an agent.

215
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:10,344
An agent who's come to
believe his own cover story.

216
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:15,981
But who's in there,
hiding in a larval state...

217
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,153
just waiting for the
proper moment to hatch out.

218
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,896
Centipedes.

219
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:52,090
"Followers of obsolete,
unthinkable trades...

220
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,179
doodling in Etruscan...

221
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:58,476
addicts of drugs not yet synthesized...

222
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,153
black marketeers of World War III...

223
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:07,995
excisors of telepathic sensitivity...

224
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:10,459
osteopaths of the spirit...

225
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:15,218
investigators... of
infractions denounced...

226
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:18,768
by bland, paranoid chess players...

227
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:22,942
servers of fragmentary
warrants taken down...

228
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,406
in hebephrenic shorthand...

229
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:30,331
charging unspeakable
mutilations of the spirit...

230
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:35,302
officials of unconstituted
police states, broke..."

231
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,557
Hi, Bill.

232
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,482
Say, why don't you and I join them?

233
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,065
Hank and I were just
bored. It wasn't serious.

234
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,781
I didn't take it
seriously. Where is Hank?

235
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,993
He got embarrassed and left.

236
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:33,251
Not before he came, I hope.

237
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,882
Hank's on junk. He doesn't come.

238
00:25:37,426 --> 00:25:39,972
Not before you came, I hope.

239
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:43,728
I'm on bug powder. I don't need to come.

240
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:48,614
"Officials of unconstituted
police states...

241
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,582
brokers of exquisite
dreams and nostalgias...

242
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:58,133
tested on the sensitized
cells of junk sickness...

243
00:25:58,217 --> 00:26:01,598
and bartered for raw
materials of the will...

244
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:09,322
drinkers of the Heavy Fluid sealed
in translucent amber of dreams."

245
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:13,789
I guess it's about time for
our William Tell routine.

246
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:57,627
Oh, God.

247
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:05,852
Joan.

248
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:09,859
Oh, Joan.

249
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:53,071
Are you a faggot?

250
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:02,590
Not by nature, no.

251
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,888
I'm not.

252
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:08,060
I wouldn't say...

253
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,856
faggot. No.

254
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,201
However, circumstances
have forced me to consider

255
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,162
the possibility that...

256
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:24,384
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

257
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:28,058
He specializes in sexual ambivalence.

258
00:28:29,352 --> 00:28:32,358
Sexual ambulance, did you say?

259
00:28:38,245 --> 00:28:40,248
My God.

260
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:43,171
He's called Mugwump.

261
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,639
No point in feigning surprise.

262
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:50,895
You knew we would be
getting in touch with you.

263
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,737
Why else would you come to
a waterfront dive like this?

264
00:28:55,947 --> 00:29:00,622
- Why else?
- I suggest a Clark Nova portable.

265
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,336
It has mythic resonance.

266
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,136
Clark Nova. A typewriter?
You suggest it for what?

267
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:10,308
For your report from
Interzone, of course.

268
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:14,318
Handwriting is not
considered professional.

269
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,489
Interzone.

270
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:23,251
- My report.
- And don't leave out any of the tasty details.

271
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,799
The small red hole in the forehead

272
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:31,017
or the look of astonishment on her face.

273
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,610
Listen to me. You're just
gonna have to leave town

274
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:40,786
and Interzone is the only place
that'll have a shady character

275
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:44,293
like you at such short
notice. Take this.

276
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:47,341
Take what? What is that?

277
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:52,310
Your ticket to Interzone.
Tourist class, I'm afraid,

278
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:55,566
but what can you expect these days?

279
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,198
We'll contact you there.

280
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:39,863
It's commie trash. And it's
been fired very recently.

281
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,076
You use it in a holdup?

282
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:47,379
I want that typewriter in the
window. I want the portable.

283
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:53,975
This plus...

284
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,734
8$. You got any ammo to go with it?

285
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,750
These'll cover the state tax.

286
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:18,565
Bill.

287
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:20,652
Martin.

288
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:24,661
Listen. I told the police it was
a drunken accident, that I saw it.

289
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:27,500
So at least that's on the
record. They're after you though.

290
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:29,921
They're saying that
you escaped from custody

291
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:33,386
and murdered your
wife, and they want you.

292
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:38,187
I'd better lie low till my ship sails.

293
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,317
You booked passage somewhere already?

294
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,405
Sure. Look. Got my ticket.

295
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:47,540
Put this away, for God's sake, Bill.

296
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:50,045
- I'll send you a report.
- You'll send me a report?

297
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:53,050
I'll send you a copy of the report.

298
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:56,976
Are you gonna be all right?

299
00:31:57,894 --> 00:32:01,150
I hear Interzone's really
nice this time of year.

300
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:59,936
He woke up in bed to find himself wedged

301
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:04,526
between a Dutch transvestite
and six Arab men.

302
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:12,919
Clark Nova. Very nice
for writing reports.

303
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:19,224
I use a Krups Dominator myself.

304
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,230
Company policy.

305
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,129
You're American, correct?

306
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:39,095
You know Dr. Benway?

307
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:47,738
I am interested in selling a
large stash of the black meat.

308
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:51,954
Verstehen Sie? The
sun-dried, powdered black meat

309
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:56,839
of the giant aquatic
Brazilian centipede.

310
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:59,010
And...

311
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:02,726
for some reason

312
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:06,568
I am certain that you are working

313
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:09,490
for Herr Dr. Benway.

314
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:16,588
I'm sorry. I apparently
mistook you for somebody else.

315
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,007
But as it happens, Mr. Lee,

316
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,226
I am, among other things a provider
of rare services to the arts

317
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:28,362
and in my experience as a provider
of rare services to the arts

318
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:32,494
I have found that writers are
a particularly needy group.

319
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:39,384
Is there nothing I can
provide for you. Mr. Lee?

320
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:14,662
A very professional operation,

321
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:18,337
as you can see, Mr. Lee.

322
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,887
You like a taste?

323
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:27,897
I'd be happy to join you in a taste,
if you're planning to have one.

324
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:51,445
You can understand that if you were

325
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:55,452
a purchasing agent for a foreign power

326
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:58,708
how it would be to my advantage

327
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:02,466
to impress you with the cleanliness

328
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:07,058
and the sincerity of our operation.

329
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:13,405
- You mentioned a Dr...
- Benway.

330
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:15,827
- Benway.
- Benway. Correct.

331
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,997
Yes.

332
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,629
Does he qualify as a foreign power?

333
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:25,053
Oh, but yes! He's very foreign.

334
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:39,499
May I?

335
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:42,754
Yes.

336
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,549
Lee, wake up. This
is no time to doze off

337
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,640
like a freckled-face
boy on a fishing raft.

338
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,029
What's up?

339
00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:06,464
Now, now, Bill. No need for that.

340
00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:09,721
You didn't think we'd
abandon you, did ya?

341
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:13,269
No. The thought never occurred to me.

342
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:16,526
Good. We like confidence in an agent.

343
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,159
But don't let it make you careless.

344
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:23,081
I was... I was just in the...

345
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:28,550
process of configuring my report.

346
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:32,182
That's good, Lee. Admirable.

347
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:34,520
But there have been some changes...

348
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,317
- Changes at the top.
- Oh, yeah?

349
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:41,409
Good changes, Bill. Fresh
blood. Sparkling insights.

350
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:47,253
Bill, could you do me a favor?

351
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:52,139
What?

352
00:38:52,222 --> 00:38:55,104
I want you to type a few words into me.

353
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:58,109
Words that I'll dictate to ya.

354
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,492
Yeah.

355
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,167
Sure. What the hell.

356
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,026
Okay. Now, the first sentence is,

357
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:22,908
"Homosexuality is the
best all-around cover

358
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,038
an agent ever had."

359
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:28,169
Come on, Bill.

360
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:35,350
Don't be such a pansy! Be forceful.

361
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,605
Hurt me.

362
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,140
I love it. That is a great sentence.

363
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:58,354
These are words to live by, Bill.

364
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:01,819
I'm glad these words are
going into your report.

365
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:04,827
Our new management will be so pleased

366
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,497
that you see our point of view.

367
00:40:10,294 --> 00:40:12,340
What point of view?

368
00:40:12,424 --> 00:40:16,558
Well, just that we
appreciate that you might find

369
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:21,317
the thought of engaging
in homosexual acts

370
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:24,740
morally and possibly even

371
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:30,377
physically repulsive
and we are encouraged

372
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:35,053
that you are able to overcome
these personal barriers

373
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:40,146
to better serve the cause to
which we are all so devoted.

374
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:58,809
You have left the Clark Nova at home?

375
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:01,522
It's doing all right without me.

376
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,504
And...

377
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:17,847
you have contacted Dr. Benway?

378
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,190
I told you before I never met the man.

379
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,615
Bill, I can smell him on you.

380
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,498
Benway marks out all
those whom he has met

381
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:35,048
like a lemur pissing on a liana
vine to mark his territory.

382
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:39,140
You're a marked man, Bill.

383
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:49,702
Joanie.

384
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:52,290
Joanie, shall we go?

385
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:55,003
Yes. Yes.

386
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,901
Hans. Hans, that couple.

387
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:08,072
Who are they?

388
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:11,703
They are Tom and Joan Frost.

389
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:16,005
Americans who have lived
here a very long time.

390
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:18,301
They're both writers.

391
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:21,347
Writers of fiction, like you.

392
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:24,898
They live in a nice flat

393
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:27,612
in the new building at
the foot of the mountain.

394
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:31,786
They're visited constantly
by many handsome,

395
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,669
young Interzone men. Sometimes...

396
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:39,719
two or three at a time.

397
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:44,102
Can you introduce me?

398
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:48,987
I do not think it would
be to your advantage.

399
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,077
For some reason

400
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,713
that woman has taken a
serious dislike to me.

401
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,763
Kiki. Come sit with us.

402
00:43:08,149 --> 00:43:10,656
Kiki, this is Mr. Lee.

403
00:43:11,073 --> 00:43:12,994
Hello.

404
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:17,502
Mr. Lee is curious
about the Frost couple.

405
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,674
He would like to meet them.

406
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:23,808
I think the woman would
have sex with you, Mr. Lee.

407
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:27,773
The man, he only likes Interzone boys.

408
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,532
I don't want to fuck 'em.
I just want to talk to 'em.

409
00:43:32,616 --> 00:43:37,418
You know how Americans are,
Kiki. They love to travel

410
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:40,966
and then they only want
to meet other Americans

411
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:45,434
and talk about how hard it
is to get a decent hamburger.

412
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:48,857
There's a party tonight
at the O'Leary place.

413
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:51,904
Frost will be meeting a group of us here

414
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:54,577
and then walking through the casbah.

415
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:58,460
My friends and I would be
happy to take you with us.

416
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,260
You're the new writer, aren't
you? You've just arrived.

417
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:06,476
A few days ago. I write reports.

418
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,194
Oh! And did you come to
Interzone for the boys?

419
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:15,201
- No, I didn't.
- Tom and I did.

420
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,872
That's quite a hot
threesome you arrived with.

421
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:21,046
They're very cheap, and
they're really a lot of fun.

422
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,864
You use a Clark Nova, don't you?

423
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:41,587
- To write with. Typewriter.
- I do. Yes.

424
00:44:42,214 --> 00:44:46,305
I wouldn't use a Clark
Nova myself. Too demanding.

425
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:48,392
Demanding?

426
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:52,942
Oh, come on. We're both writers.
We know what we're talking about.

427
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:56,409
Well, I'm new to this
game, to tell you the truth.

428
00:44:57,453 --> 00:45:01,544
If I get blocked again, I'll
let you try my Martinelli.

429
00:45:02,128 --> 00:45:04,800
Her inventiveness will surprise you.

430
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:07,807
I can't wait.

431
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:14,486
They say you murdered
your wife. Is that true?

432
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:16,657
Who told you that?

433
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:21,917
- Word gets around.
- It wasn't murder. It was an accident.

434
00:45:23,714 --> 00:45:25,801
There are no accidents.

435
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:31,353
For example,

436
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:36,155
I've been killing my own wife
slowly, over a period of years.

437
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:38,534
- What?
- Well, not intentionally.

438
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:42,919
I mean, on the level of conscious
intention, it's insane, monstrous.

439
00:45:43,003 --> 00:45:46,885
But you do consciously know it. You
just said it. We're discussing it.

440
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:50,349
Not consciously.

441
00:45:51,227 --> 00:45:53,732
This is all happening telepathically.

442
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:56,988
- Nonconsciously.
- What do you mean?

443
00:45:59,242 --> 00:46:01,914
If you look carefully
at my lips you'll realize

444
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:05,047
that I'm actually saying something else.

445
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,258
I'm not actually telling
you about the several ways

446
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:09,805
I'm gradually murdering Joan,

447
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,438
about the housekeeper Fadela, whom
I've hired to make Joan deathly ill

448
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,522
by witchcraft,

449
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,781
about the medicines and
drugs I've given her,

450
00:46:17,864 --> 00:46:21,871
about the constant nibbling away
at her self-esteem and sanity

451
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:26,255
that I've managed without
being at all obvious about it.

452
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:31,641
Whereas Joanie finds
that she simply cannot be

453
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:34,397
as obsessively precise
as she wants to be,

454
00:46:35,231 --> 00:46:38,487
unless she writes
everything in longhand.

455
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:42,580
Look...

456
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:44,749
I'm afraid...

457
00:46:46,295 --> 00:46:49,008
I'm not gonna be very
good company tonight.

458
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:53,435
Thanks for the invite. I think
I'll have to take a rain check.

459
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,228
Enjoying the beach?

460
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:23,954
I would never have expected
to see you up and out so early.

461
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:29,047
You certainly were in rough shape
at the O'Leary party last night.

462
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:30,759
Was I?

463
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:37,523
You were very raw. Emotionally, I mean.

464
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:40,486
You seemed to be in a lot of pain.

465
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:48,002
I don't remember... pain.

466
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:52,971
In fact, I don't remember
the O'Leary party.

467
00:47:55,224 --> 00:47:57,730
In fact, I don't remember you.

468
00:47:58,564 --> 00:48:02,489
It was a very intense
performance in any case.

469
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,078
My name's Cloquet.

470
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,428
Yves Cloquet.

471
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:17,645
Can I buy you breakfast?

472
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:32,757
I've seen you around, but I
had no idea you were queer.

473
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:39,814
- Queer.
- I saw you arrive with those three Interzone boys.

474
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:43,112
What an entrance. You all looked very...

475
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:45,908
familiar with each other.

476
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:49,542
Queer.

477
00:48:50,877 --> 00:48:53,758
A curse. Been in our
family for generations.

478
00:48:53,842 --> 00:48:57,432
The Lees have always been perverts.

479
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:02,359
I shall never forget
the unspeakable horror

480
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:05,782
that froze the lymph in my glands

481
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:10,834
when the baneful word
seared my reeling brain...

482
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:13,005
I...

483
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:15,385
was a homosexual.

484
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,268
I thought of the painted,
simpering female impersonators

485
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:23,151
I had seen in a Baltimore nightclub.

486
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:29,412
Could it be possible I was
one of those subhuman things?

487
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,047
I walked the streets in a daze

488
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:38,890
like a man with a light concussion.
I would have destroyed myself.

489
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,649
But a wise old queen...

490
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:46,363
Bobo, we called her.

491
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:49,745
Taught me that I had a duty

492
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:54,630
to live and to bear my
burden proudly for all to see.

493
00:49:56,466 --> 00:49:59,472
Poor Bobo came to a sticky end.

494
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:05,067
He was riding in the Duc
de Ventre's Hispano-Suiza

495
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:07,906
when his falling hemorrhoids
blew out of the car

496
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:10,286
and wrapped around the rear wheel.

497
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:14,294
He was completely gutted,
leaving an empty shell

498
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:17,926
sitting there on the
giraffe-skin upholstery.

499
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,192
Even the eyes and the brain went

500
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:29,574
with a horrible "schlupping" sound.

501
00:50:31,035 --> 00:50:32,539
The duke says he will carry

502
00:50:32,623 --> 00:50:36,380
that ghastly schlup with
him to his mausoleum.

503
00:50:39,511 --> 00:50:42,518
You sound as if you could use a drink.

504
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:44,980
My place?

505
00:50:45,273 --> 00:50:47,360
A drink.

506
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,457
A drink?

507
00:50:55,293 --> 00:50:57,380
No.

508
00:50:57,715 --> 00:51:01,723
No, I can't. I gotta go
home. I have a... I have a...

509
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,563
I have a report to write. Excuse me.

510
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:15,740
You made a big hit with
our young friend Yves.

511
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,462
- Yves?
- Cloquet.

512
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:27,763
Yves said you were wonderfully funny.

513
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:30,352
Said you did a little
routine that made him

514
00:53:30,436 --> 00:53:32,815
chuckle to himself all day.

515
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,792
Yes, you could...

516
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:46,509
You could probably get him into
bed if you worked at it a bit.

517
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:49,600
Deadly aphrodisiac, humor.

518
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,774
I'm not... I don't really...

519
00:53:57,783 --> 00:53:59,954
Have you seen Hans around?

520
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:03,377
You mean you haven't heard?

521
00:54:06,091 --> 00:54:09,932
- No. I haven't heard.
- Hans was arrested and deported two weeks ago.

522
00:54:12,103 --> 00:54:14,191
Deported?

523
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:18,783
They let him take his
clothes and his passport.

524
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:23,000
That was it. Everything else
nationalized, as they say.

525
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:29,178
- Why?
- He neglected to pay the right officials, I think.

526
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:33,103
You knew he ran a drug
factory in the medina?

527
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:39,532
What...

528
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:45,961
- What drug did he manufacture?
- Nothing too exotic.

529
00:54:46,462 --> 00:54:49,970
Majoun, I think. It's a
local hash resin-almond paste.

530
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:55,272
You'd spread it on a
muffin like jam. Try it.

531
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:12,808
While you're at it, why
don't you try my Martinelli?

532
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,191
Take her now.

533
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:21,700
Try her out.

534
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,258
Holy shit. That machine doesn't
belong to me. It's Tom Frost's.

535
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:15,427
My God, Lee...

536
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:19,395
Surely you know better than to bring
an enemy agent into your own home.

537
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,357
You gave me no choice.

538
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,613
You were giving her access to
your innermost vulnerabilities

539
00:57:24,696 --> 00:57:26,742
forcing them on her, for God's sake!

540
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:28,746
But what am I gonna tell him?

541
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,875
What's your assessment of the situation?

542
00:57:30,959 --> 00:57:34,883
Did Frost know that his
machine was an Interzonal agent?

543
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:41,480
He and his wife appear
to have a close connection

544
00:57:41,564 --> 00:57:45,195
with the indigenous population here.

545
00:57:46,615 --> 00:57:50,248
His wife. Yeah, yeah! Of course!

546
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:51,959
The key is Joan Frost.

547
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:56,509
You will seduce her, and you will
discover the substance of her report

548
00:57:56,593 --> 00:57:58,806
and deliver it directly to me.

549
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:02,856
Seduce her? But what about
Kiki and the Interzone boys?

550
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:04,861
- My cover.
- It'll work beautifully, Bill.

551
00:58:04,944 --> 00:58:08,868
The opposition will be
thrown into total confusion.

552
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:02,224
- Tom's gone out with the boys.
- I came to see you.

553
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,901
There's a great restaurant in
New York looks just like this.

554
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:30,490
Oh, really?

555
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:43,683
- You write in longhand.
- Yes.

556
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:48,358
I'm not good with machines.
They intimidate me.

557
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:52,284
- I think I broke Tom's typewriter.
- The Martinelli?

558
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:55,497
- He'll be furious.
- Does he have another one?

559
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:59,965
Yes, he has that one, the
Mujahideen. It's Arabic.

560
01:00:00,048 --> 01:00:03,472
- Does he use it much?
- Not much.

561
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,561
What happened to the Martinelli?

562
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,277
I probably just threw it
on the floor and smashed it.

563
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,616
Probably? You don't know?

564
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:17,166
I suffer from...
sporadic hallucinations.

565
01:00:19,587 --> 01:00:21,674
Join the club.

566
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,271
Do you intend to kill Tom's Mujahideen?

567
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:32,030
Only in self-defense.

568
01:00:32,113 --> 01:00:34,284
I understood writing could be dangerous.

569
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:37,791
I didn't realize the danger
came from the machinery.

570
01:00:37,874 --> 01:00:41,715
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

571
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:54,907
- Are you gonna write something in Arabic?
- No. You are.

572
01:00:55,994 --> 01:00:59,293
I don't like using Tom's things.

573
01:01:00,713 --> 01:01:02,841
We don't trespass on each other.

574
01:01:04,636 --> 01:01:07,934
Do you have any objection
to trying some of this?

575
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:13,112
I can't read it. Is it erotic?

576
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:15,491
It's... fairly erotic.

577
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:18,038
- Kind of uncivilized.
- More erotic.

578
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:25,928
- Filthier.
- Filthier? Okay. All you think about.

579
01:01:51,563 --> 01:01:53,859
Ooh, this is very good.

580
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:33,147
Joan. Oh, Joan...

581
01:02:58,531 --> 01:03:03,457
Mrs. Frost! This is an evil and
insane thing that you are doing.

582
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,752
You must stop it at once!

583
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:14,019
Pull up your hair.

584
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:21,453
Who's that?

585
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:23,664
My housekeeper.

586
01:04:21,655 --> 01:04:24,160
It's my Mujahideen.

587
01:04:28,252 --> 01:04:30,549
For God's sake!

588
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:45,953
It jumped of its own accord.
You did see that, didn't you?

589
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:52,718
Joan, are you all right? What happened?

590
01:04:53,343 --> 01:04:55,765
Fadela stormed in here,

591
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,436
and she threw your
typewriter out the window.

592
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:01,193
That's it. The woman has to go.

593
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:04,491
She certainly seemed deadly to me.

594
01:05:05,493 --> 01:05:07,454
I knew it.

595
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,089
Look, Tom. Look.

596
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:19,562
This is how Fadela's been
controlling you, Joan.

597
01:05:19,938 --> 01:05:22,276
Your blood, your pubic
hair, your fingernails.

598
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,823
Fadela controls nobody, and you know it.

599
01:05:24,906 --> 01:05:26,869
We have forced control upon her.

600
01:05:26,953 --> 01:05:29,456
Poor woman's probably desperate
to get out of our household.

601
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:32,547
No, missus. She's making
you say everything,

602
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,426
even that.

603
01:05:34,509 --> 01:05:38,684
You must find all of these in
your house. You must destroy them.

604
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:45,780
Bill, I'm going to need my Martinelli.

605
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:51,168
I feel desperately insecure
without a typewriter in the house.

606
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:54,674
Yes, I haven't had a chance
to try it out yet, Tom.

607
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:55,760
I was kind of hoping.

608
01:05:55,844 --> 01:05:59,183
I'll leave Hafid here with you,
Joanie, in case Fadela comes back.

609
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:02,900
Bill and I will go to his place
and pick up the Martinelli now.

610
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:07,240
I'll go with Bill. You two
stay here. I need to get out.

611
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:27,658
Fadela's within 30 feet of
us. See if you can find her.

612
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:39,222
There. She's right there.

613
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:55,044
That thing she's cutting up...
have you ever seen that before?

614
01:06:55,128 --> 01:07:00,306
No. Looks like some kind
of sea creature, I think.

615
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:04,313
All those women... they work for her.

616
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:09,031
In a sense. They're all Fadela's lovers.

617
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:19,010
I'm going to have to.

618
01:07:19,386 --> 01:07:24,188
I'm gonna have to stay here
with Fadela... do penance.

619
01:09:37,996 --> 01:09:40,124
I've been instructed to reveal to you

620
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:43,799
that you were programmed to
shoot your wife, Joan Lee.

621
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:47,515
It was not an act of
free will on your part.

622
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,896
Hey!

623
01:09:54,237 --> 01:09:56,325
Who the fuck asked ya?

624
01:09:58,244 --> 01:10:01,960
You worry me, Bill. You
cause me many anxious moments.

625
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,802
Oh, gee, I hope you're
not losing any sleep.

626
01:10:05,886 --> 01:10:08,474
No need to be nasty, Bill.
There was some thought

627
01:10:08,558 --> 01:10:11,688
that you might actually want
to hear this information,

628
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:14,860
that it might assuage your guilt.

629
01:10:15,446 --> 01:10:19,203
Save the psychoanalysis for
your grasshopper friends.

630
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:24,672
You have to admit, it was
a pretty tasty setup, Bill.

631
01:10:24,756 --> 01:10:28,012
Joan marries you as part of
her agent's cover, not realizing

632
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:31,727
that you were the very enemy
agent assigned to kill her.

633
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:35,527
As elegant as it is brilliant.

634
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:45,965
Wait a minute.

635
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:52,604
You're saying that Joan was sent by
Interzone Incorporated to marry me?

636
01:10:52,688 --> 01:10:58,532
Yeah. In fact, she was sent to you
by Fadela, who was her controller.

637
01:10:58,615 --> 01:11:01,787
We did a lot of groundwork
to set you up in their files

638
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,252
as the prime candidate for marriage.

639
01:11:04,335 --> 01:11:07,843
And it didn't matter that I
didn't know anything about it?

640
01:11:07,926 --> 01:11:10,973
An unconscious agent is
an effective agent, Bill.

641
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:15,524
The situation does generate
some ethical paradoxes at times.

642
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:18,113
I'm the first to admit that.

643
01:11:19,364 --> 01:11:23,915
When you bugs first approached me,

644
01:11:23,998 --> 01:11:27,632
one of your associates suggested

645
01:11:27,715 --> 01:11:30,638
that Joan was possibly not human.

646
01:11:31,432 --> 01:11:33,559
What did he mean by that?

647
01:11:33,643 --> 01:11:36,231
Women aren't human, Bill.

648
01:11:36,608 --> 01:11:40,824
Or perhaps more precisely, they're
a different species from men

649
01:11:40,909 --> 01:11:44,374
with different wills and
different purposes on Earth.

650
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:46,711
You know this instinctively, Bill

651
01:11:46,795 --> 01:11:50,887
and it's your instincts that
make you such a good operative.

652
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:54,226
I'm talking about Joan.

653
01:11:56,564 --> 01:11:59,278
If Joan Lee wasn't human,

654
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:02,326
what was she?

655
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:05,709
Well, Joan was a special case.

656
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,842
Joan was an elite-corps centipede.

657
01:12:13,265 --> 01:12:15,352
Joan was a centipede.

658
01:12:23,367 --> 01:12:27,711
- Where's my Martinelli?
- Jesus, Tom, are you nuts?

659
01:12:27,794 --> 01:12:31,301
Don't fuck with me, Lee.
I want my typewriter.

660
01:12:33,136 --> 01:12:37,062
A lot of people have tried to
silence me. All have failed.

661
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:40,362
Tom.

662
01:12:40,695 --> 01:12:42,782
She's here

663
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:45,329
in pieces.

664
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:48,503
I fear it's hopeless.

665
01:12:54,764 --> 01:12:57,937
All right. We're taking your Clark Nova.

666
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:01,862
Hafid, the bag.

667
01:13:25,994 --> 01:13:27,580
What's going on here?

668
01:13:27,663 --> 01:13:30,209
Wait, wait! This is a
heinous mistake you're making.

669
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:34,635
- Lee, do something. Stop them.
- He's got a gun, Clark Nova.

670
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,016
You don't want to lose
your best agent, do ya?

671
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:39,269
You're gonna have to
write a full report, Lee.

672
01:13:39,352 --> 01:13:42,902
- And I mean full.
- How am I gonna write it, in longhand?

673
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,951
Will you take this sack
off! This is insubordination!

674
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:51,085
You're all gonna pay for
this! Heads are gonna roll!

675
01:13:52,505 --> 01:13:54,384
Your days in Interzone
are numbered, Lee.

676
01:13:54,467 --> 01:13:57,474
I suggest you give up the writing game.

677
01:13:57,557 --> 01:13:59,977
Make tracks for another
part of the world.

678
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:10,749
Fuck 'em all. Squares on both sides.

679
01:14:11,502 --> 01:14:15,174
I am the only complete
man in the industry.

680
01:14:42,897 --> 01:14:44,985
Bill.

681
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,198
Bill?

682
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:58,679
I must be hallucinating.
What are you cats doing here?

683
01:14:58,763 --> 01:15:02,353
We're here to see you, Bill. Come on.

684
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:03,940
It's probably the first time

685
01:15:04,023 --> 01:15:06,694
you haven't been
hallucinating in a long time.

686
01:15:08,115 --> 01:15:10,620
What are you talking
about? What are you saying?

687
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:13,207
Naturally, I've had a few odd moments.

688
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:17,508
Everybody blacks out in
Interzone. Wouldn't you?

689
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:20,140
- Definitely.
- Sure.

690
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,399
What's in the pillowcase, Bill?

691
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:29,783
These are the remains of
my last writing machine.

692
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:32,246
It's been a big problem for me.

693
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:35,293
- Mind if I take a look?
- Go ahead.

694
01:15:40,595 --> 01:15:43,268
Wait a minute. Where are we going?

695
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:48,110
- Oh, man.
- How about back to your place?

696
01:15:48,194 --> 01:15:50,364
- Nope.
- Why not?

697
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:55,585
I'm not safe there.
I'm a dead duck there.

698
01:15:56,212 --> 01:15:58,799
We'll protect you.

699
01:15:58,883 --> 01:16:02,723
You boys are kidding yourselves.

700
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:06,898
- You're babes in the woods here.
- What do you suggest?

701
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:09,569
We thought it was important for us
to help you get your book together.

702
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:13,370
Yeah, I've sent sections of it to
my publisher, and they're interested.

703
01:16:13,453 --> 01:16:17,254
- All you gotta do is finish it.
- You've already done the hard part.

704
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:21,386
Book. My book?

705
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:24,267
Yeah. The one you've
been calling Naked Lunch.

706
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:32,825
Where did you put that
Bradley the Buyer routine?

707
01:16:32,908 --> 01:16:36,124
- Did you find it all?
- Yeah. It's on the sofa

708
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:38,712
right next to the
Hassan's Rumpus Room riff.

709
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:43,138
- It's all right there.
- I never saw those pages before.

710
01:16:44,222 --> 01:16:47,438
I truly do suspect some
sort of colossal con.

711
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:50,527
Someone's planted these
pages in your room, right?

712
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:52,700
Somebody sent all those letters to me

713
01:16:52,782 --> 01:16:54,952
and signed them with your name, right?

714
01:16:56,164 --> 01:16:58,710
A well-orchestrated
cabal could easily manage

715
01:16:58,793 --> 01:17:01,341
all of these simple things, children.

716
01:17:01,423 --> 01:17:03,679
When will you learn?

717
01:17:03,763 --> 01:17:05,807
They've done you a
favor, 'cause this stuff

718
01:17:05,891 --> 01:17:09,608
is gonna get published under your
name, and you'll have a career.

719
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:13,281
Yeah, you'll probably get
into print before we will.

720
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:17,499
For God's sake, Bill, play
ball with this conspiracy.

721
01:17:17,582 --> 01:17:20,587
You're patronizing me, boys...

722
01:17:21,632 --> 01:17:24,762
but I don't mind, 'cause
you're so sweet to me, too.

723
01:17:25,806 --> 01:17:28,185
Hey, Martin, listen to this.

724
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:31,150
"So we start for New Orleans past.

725
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:34,615
Iridescent lakes and orange gas flares

726
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:37,078
and swamps and garbage heaps...

727
01:17:37,495 --> 01:17:41,504
alligators crawling around in
broken bottles and tin cans...

728
01:17:41,587 --> 01:17:44,218
neon arabesques of motels...

729
01:17:45,011 --> 01:17:47,683
marooned pimps scream
obscenities at passing cars

730
01:17:47,767 --> 01:17:50,355
from islands of rubbish.

731
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:53,778
New Orleans is a dead museum."

732
01:17:55,324 --> 01:17:57,411
So nice.

733
01:17:58,162 --> 01:18:00,250
Sound familiar, Bill?

734
01:18:02,047 --> 01:18:05,636
First time I ever heard it. Read on.

735
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:30,101
I think it's time to
discuss your philosophy

736
01:18:30,184 --> 01:18:34,025
of drug use as it relates
to artistic endeavor.

737
01:18:34,651 --> 01:18:37,826
I think it's time to bring
this meeting to order.

738
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:43,378
I think it's time for you
boys to share my last taste

739
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:45,841
of the true black meat.

740
01:18:47,762 --> 01:18:52,772
The flesh of the giant
aquatic Brazilian centipede.

741
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:00,120
So we're still here in
Interzone with Bill, right?

742
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:04,170
- That's right.
- Now we're gonna travel back to the city, right?

743
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:05,547
That's right, Hank.

744
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:08,470
I think Bill's on top of
things here, don't you?

745
01:19:08,553 --> 01:19:13,898
He has a grip on a certain
unique reality principle, yes.

746
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:16,235
I think you both should consider
staying here for a few months.

747
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,159
Everything you could want
is cheap and plentiful here.

748
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:23,709
That reality principle thing
could work for you, too.

749
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:28,594
My mother's all alone, and
she's kind of sick, Bill.

750
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:31,974
And besides, my book's as
all-American as football.

751
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:33,685
Couldn't finish it here.

752
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,609
America is not a young land.

753
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:42,454
It is old... and dirty and evil.

754
01:19:42,538 --> 01:19:45,460
Before the settlers, before the Indians.

755
01:19:48,091 --> 01:19:51,472
The evil is there waiting.

756
01:19:58,446 --> 01:20:00,532
What about you, Martin?

757
01:20:03,122 --> 01:20:08,548
Maybe you can move into my
place. What do you think?

758
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:16,814
Stay until you finish the
book, but then come back to us.

759
01:20:35,185 --> 01:20:37,272
You'll be okay?

760
01:20:40,027 --> 01:20:44,454
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
The Zone is full of surprises.

761
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:49,338
The Zone takes care of its own.

762
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:31,087
William?

763
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:39,437
You look terrible.
What are you doing here?

764
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:43,739
I don't know. I don't know.

765
01:21:45,952 --> 01:21:48,039
I just...

766
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:54,886
My only fr... My only
friends in the world.

767
01:21:58,476 --> 01:22:02,359
I'm afraid I'll never see 'em again.

768
01:22:04,404 --> 01:22:06,784
I'm feeling so...

769
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,129
Severed.

770
01:22:13,548 --> 01:22:16,890
Come with me. Take me home.

771
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:21,732
I can't go home. I can't go home.

772
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:30,206
Is that your typing machine there?

773
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,336
Foutu.

774
01:22:32,419 --> 01:22:36,260
Broken... beyond repair.

775
01:22:37,889 --> 01:22:40,353
If we fix the typing machine

776
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:42,815
we also fix the life.

777
01:23:02,688 --> 01:23:06,655
There. You see? There's
no cause for despair.

778
01:23:06,738 --> 01:23:09,828
In this shop, anything can
be fixed that is broken.

779
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:45,523
I don't know, Kiki.

780
01:23:46,525 --> 01:23:49,866
They don't seem to be
capable of delicate work here.

781
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:52,997
You must have faith, William.

782
01:23:53,998 --> 01:23:58,090
Look. We have your new writing machine.

783
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:36,543
Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.

784
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:39,758
I feel very comfortable
working with you.

785
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:43,306
I like that sense of
camaraderie in an agent.

786
01:24:43,389 --> 01:24:46,227
You must be progressing.

787
01:24:46,311 --> 01:24:50,945
My predecessor felt you had an
ambivalent relationship with him.

788
01:24:52,784 --> 01:24:55,705
- You mean Clark Nova.
- Yes.

789
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,085
How is he?

790
01:24:58,168 --> 01:25:00,590
He's still in the hands of our enemies.

791
01:25:00,673 --> 01:25:06,185
- Such are the hazards of our trade.
- A hazardous trade, yes.

792
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:10,485
Your report on the subversive
activities of Joan Frost

793
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:12,782
was a model of its type.

794
01:25:12,865 --> 01:25:16,372
If you continue to develop
your skills as an operative

795
01:25:16,455 --> 01:25:21,214
I think a top position with
the C.I.A. is not out of reach.

796
01:25:21,882 --> 01:25:24,054
The C.I.A.? You really think so?

797
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:28,563
You have the demeanor. That's
something you can't buy.

798
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:37,540
The C.I.A.

799
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:44,595
That's a career you can really
sink your teeth into. It has...

800
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,186
resonance.

801
01:25:49,731 --> 01:25:52,986
But giving yourself
over to being a writer...

802
01:25:58,248 --> 01:26:01,086
This stuff is very potent.

803
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:04,050
The two are very closely related.

804
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:06,096
So you boys keep telling me.

805
01:26:07,097 --> 01:26:10,981
Well, what's my next assignment?

806
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:15,156
- I'm hungry for adventure.
- Excellent.

807
01:26:15,281 --> 01:26:18,788
You know the Swiss dandy Cloquet?

808
01:26:18,871 --> 01:26:20,959
- Yes.
- And?

809
01:26:23,673 --> 01:26:26,847
I think he's a faggito
and won't admit it.

810
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,477
That ought to make it all easier.

811
01:26:29,561 --> 01:26:32,859
You will seduce or
otherwise compromise Cloquet.

812
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:38,035
We have it on good authority
that he's our conduit to Benway.

813
01:26:38,578 --> 01:26:42,460
- Dr. Benway, M.D.,
Ph. D.? - Self-styled.

814
01:26:42,544 --> 01:26:45,509
He never actually made
it through medical school.

815
01:26:45,593 --> 01:26:47,554
He runs an interesting little show here

816
01:26:47,637 --> 01:26:52,188
which he calls Interzone, Inc.
Pretentious, if you ask me.

817
01:26:52,271 --> 01:26:54,318
Benway's behind Interzone, Inc.?

818
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:57,617
The base of his pyramid is
a drug called the black meat.

819
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,455
- The pyramid's tip...
- Is?

820
01:27:00,538 --> 01:27:02,627
Well, we'd like to know.

821
01:27:06,591 --> 01:27:08,679
Dr. Benway.

822
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,146
- Of course.
- Yes.

823
01:27:14,191 --> 01:27:16,780
And he's obviously
got sensational cover.

824
01:27:16,863 --> 01:27:19,410
He's floated in and out
of the Zone for years

825
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:22,082
without anybody
actually ever seeing him.

826
01:27:22,165 --> 01:27:27,676
- But now the pressure's on to place an agent close to him.
- Me.

827
01:27:29,096 --> 01:27:31,601
Assessments are being made.

828
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:53,268
- You're working away, William?
- Yes, Kiki.

829
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:58,279
The machine turns out
to be a very good one.

830
01:27:58,863 --> 01:28:00,950
Muy simpatico.

831
01:28:03,038 --> 01:28:06,463
And I have you to thank for it

832
01:28:06,546 --> 01:28:08,633
and so I will.

833
01:28:08,843 --> 01:28:10,929
Thank you.

834
01:28:12,432 --> 01:28:15,772
I'm very proud to be
your friend, you know.

835
01:28:17,193 --> 01:28:20,824
I'm very proud that I can
help you to be a writer.

836
01:28:22,285 --> 01:28:25,417
You have done that,
Kiki. You really have.

837
01:28:36,605 --> 01:28:40,321
- Would you like some tea?
- That would be lovely, William.

838
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,420
Kiki.

839
01:28:50,341 --> 01:28:53,014
Do you know Cloquet?

840
01:28:53,097 --> 01:28:57,188
The Swiss man with the big
house on the Old Valley Road?

841
01:28:57,647 --> 01:28:59,735
Cloquet?

842
01:29:00,695 --> 01:29:04,329
Oh, yes, yes. Yves
with the wonderful car.

843
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,127
He has a wonderful car?

844
01:29:09,547 --> 01:29:12,009
The most wonderful car.

845
01:29:20,234 --> 01:29:22,155
Enjoying the ride?

846
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:24,743
I'm wild about it, yes. Thank you.

847
01:29:25,244 --> 01:29:28,042
It's good to be wild sometimes.

848
01:29:29,503 --> 01:29:32,842
You know, I have often thought
of that funny story you told me

849
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:34,764
the first time we met on the beach.

850
01:29:34,847 --> 01:29:37,143
The one about the Duc de Ventre.

851
01:29:38,563 --> 01:29:42,278
At first I didn't know how to take it.

852
01:29:42,362 --> 01:29:45,618
I thought you were making a pass at me.

853
01:29:48,624 --> 01:29:52,508
Did I ever tell you about the man
who taught his asshole to talk?

854
01:29:53,426 --> 01:29:56,433
His whole abdomen would
move up and down, you dig,

855
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,811
farting out the words.

856
01:29:59,229 --> 01:30:04,281
It was unlike anything I ever
heard. Bubbly, thick, stagnant sound.

857
01:30:04,364 --> 01:30:06,785
A sound you could smell.

858
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:08,749
This man worked for
the carnival, you dig?

859
01:30:08,832 --> 01:30:12,547
And to start with it was like
a novelty ventriloquist act.

860
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:14,594
After a while, the ass
started talking on its own.

861
01:30:14,677 --> 01:30:17,057
He would go in without anything prepared

862
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:21,190
and his ass would ad-lib and toss
the gags back at him every time.

863
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:26,241
Then it developed sort of teeth like

864
01:30:26,325 --> 01:30:29,121
little raspy incurving
hooks and started eating.

865
01:30:29,206 --> 01:30:32,170
He thought this was cute at first
and built an act around it...

866
01:30:32,254 --> 01:30:34,216
but the asshole would eat
its way through his pants

867
01:30:34,299 --> 01:30:38,182
and start talking on the street
shouting out it wanted equal rights.

868
01:30:38,265 --> 01:30:40,144
It would get drunk, too,

869
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:42,732
and have crying jags. Nobody loved it.

870
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:46,073
And it wanted to be kissed,
same as any other mouth.

871
01:30:46,156 --> 01:30:48,412
Finally, it talked all
the time, day and night.

872
01:30:48,495 --> 01:30:50,331
You could hear him for blocks,

873
01:30:50,415 --> 01:30:55,048
screaming at it to shut up,
beating at it with his fists

874
01:30:55,132 --> 01:30:58,305
and sticking candles up it, but...

875
01:30:58,389 --> 01:31:00,811
nothing did any good, and
the asshole said to him,

876
01:31:00,894 --> 01:31:03,732
"It is you who will shut
up in the end, not me,

877
01:31:03,816 --> 01:31:07,574
because we don't need
you around here anymore.

878
01:31:07,657 --> 01:31:11,458
I can talk and eat and shit."

879
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,879
After that, he began
waking up in the morning

880
01:31:13,962 --> 01:31:18,345
with transparent jelly like a tad
pole's tail all over his mouth.

881
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,356
He would tear it off his mouth and
the pieces would stick to his hands

882
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:28,449
like burning gasoline
jelly and grow there.

883
01:31:28,532 --> 01:31:33,333
So, finally, his mouth
sealed over and the whole head

884
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:36,925
would have amputated spontaneously
except for the eyes, you dig?

885
01:31:37,008 --> 01:31:40,223
That's the one thing that the
asshole couldn't do was see.

886
01:31:40,306 --> 01:31:42,351
It needed the eyes.

887
01:31:42,769 --> 01:31:47,195
Nerve connections were blocked
and infiltrated and atrophied.

888
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:50,701
So, the brain couldn't
give orders anymore.

889
01:31:50,953 --> 01:31:55,920
It was trapped inside
the skull... sealed off.

890
01:31:57,926 --> 01:32:01,598
For a while, you could
see... the silent,

891
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:05,731
helpless suffering of
the brain behind the eyes.

892
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:10,200
And then finally the
brain must have died

893
01:32:10,284 --> 01:32:12,787
because the eyes went out

894
01:32:12,871 --> 01:32:15,084
and there was no more feeling in them

895
01:32:15,168 --> 01:32:18,758
than a crab's eye at the end of a stalk.

896
01:32:31,033 --> 01:32:34,498
You seem to like my
little friend. I'm so glad.

897
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:39,549
I'm writing a business piece on
corporate life in North Africa.

898
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:48,359
Oh, my, my. We are
fragile today, aren't we?

899
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:52,825
- He has to get to know you first.
- Oh, does he?

900
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:55,331
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

901
01:32:58,463 --> 01:33:00,591
Kiki, will you come and
see the parrots with me?

902
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,763
There are cages in the master bedroom.

903
01:33:02,846 --> 01:33:05,935
I don't think I can, Mr. Cloquet.

904
01:33:06,018 --> 01:33:09,025
That is, I don't really want to.

905
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:14,160
I'd particularly like to
interview a certain Dr. Benway.

906
01:33:15,246 --> 01:33:18,586
Kiki doesn't seem to find my
parrots attractive anymore.

907
01:33:18,669 --> 01:33:20,298
Isn't that sad?

908
01:33:20,381 --> 01:33:23,513
Kiki would love to play
with your parrots, Yves,

909
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:28,397
but Kiki is as anxious to contact
this Benway character as I am.

910
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:33,408
Fadela, the witch who
works for the Frosts,

911
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:37,248
she and Benway are... intimates.

912
01:33:37,499 --> 01:33:40,129
You didn't hear it from me.

913
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:43,469
Kiki?

914
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:49,565
Go see the fucking parrots, will
you, Kiki? I gotta take a piss.

915
01:33:51,694 --> 01:33:54,367
Then I'll come and get
you, and we'll go home.

916
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:56,996
Pissoir's at the end of the great hall.

917
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:34,024
Hello, Bill. What's up?

918
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:38,114
Something the matter?

919
01:35:39,326 --> 01:35:41,789
You seem distracted.

920
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:49,721
I wish you'd say something.

921
01:35:50,389 --> 01:35:54,856
- I don't like this mood. Are we going out?
- You're going out.

922
01:35:55,065 --> 01:35:58,906
Why don't you just write
something and calm yourself down?

923
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:02,246
You're obviously not in a
professional state of mind.

924
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:05,545
Maybe I should write about
your little double cross.

925
01:36:05,629 --> 01:36:10,305
You expected me to end up in that
parrot cage with Cloquet, didn't you?

926
01:36:11,138 --> 01:36:14,187
Bill, are you thinking
of getting rid of me?

927
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:19,448
I think an exchange of hostages
is the only viable scenario.

928
01:36:19,531 --> 01:36:24,332
No, Bill, if you get rid of
me you sever ties with reality.

929
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:29,551
For instance, take the case
of... Of the female agent

930
01:36:29,635 --> 01:36:33,559
who forgot her real identity
and merged with her cover story.

931
01:36:33,642 --> 01:36:36,525
She is still a fricoteuse in Annexia.

932
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:40,322
And incidentally, you can make
a square, heterosex citizen queer

933
01:36:40,406 --> 01:36:42,785
with this angle using drugs...

934
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:48,673
Tom, I've brought you a new typewriter

935
01:36:48,757 --> 01:36:51,804
which conveniently dispenses
two types of intoxicating fluids

936
01:36:51,888 --> 01:36:54,308
when it likes what you've written.

937
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:59,820
Are you proposing to trade
back for your Clark Nova?

938
01:36:59,946 --> 01:37:01,992
Thinking of it.

939
01:37:02,576 --> 01:37:05,039
Has it written anything
good for you lately?

940
01:37:05,707 --> 01:37:10,174
No. It's too damned
all-American for my taste.

941
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:13,180
Guess I've gone foreign or something.

942
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:18,273
Well, my Mugwriter here is
so foreign, it's almost alien.

943
01:37:18,858 --> 01:37:22,991
You're gonna do your best
work on her. Guaranteed.

944
01:37:29,879 --> 01:37:31,759
Hafid,

945
01:37:31,843 --> 01:37:35,057
bring the machine in
question for Bill, will you?

946
01:37:48,334 --> 01:37:51,131
And how are you enjoying
your affair with Joan?

947
01:37:51,214 --> 01:37:54,889
Literate, complex and
neurotic, I would imagine.

948
01:37:59,105 --> 01:38:01,276
I haven't seen her for weeks.

949
01:38:02,404 --> 01:38:07,205
- She ran off with Fadela and her coven.
- That's too bad.

950
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:13,426
Yes, she does that when she
feels attracted to a man.

951
01:38:13,968 --> 01:38:16,598
Don't give up though. It's a good sign.

952
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:20,439
With Joanie the courtship period

953
01:38:20,523 --> 01:38:24,949
can involve years of
passionate ambivalence.

954
01:38:29,999 --> 01:38:34,509
Tom, I think we should take a
close look at his machine first,

955
01:38:34,592 --> 01:38:38,725
test it thoroughly. Don't you, Tom?

956
01:38:39,519 --> 01:38:43,192
You both have different writing styles.

957
01:38:43,276 --> 01:38:48,078
Bill Lee has always been a man
of powerful instinct, Hafid.

958
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,711
If he says I'll do my
best work on his machine,

959
01:38:51,794 --> 01:38:54,382
I'm sure that's prophecy.

960
01:38:58,515 --> 01:39:01,229
Take the gun, too, Bill.

961
01:39:02,231 --> 01:39:06,281
No American should find himself
in a foreign land without a pistol.

962
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:11,542
You wouldn't be trying to
set me up again, would you?

963
01:39:11,626 --> 01:39:14,756
You've set yourself up already, Bill.

964
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,433
I'm just trying to give you
a fighting chance. That's all.

965
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:40,933
Clark Nova.

966
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,189
Clark Nova, it's me.

967
01:39:43,522 --> 01:39:47,406
It's Bill Lee. Clark Nova, speak to me.

968
01:39:47,531 --> 01:39:49,575
You're safe with me now.

969
01:39:50,244 --> 01:39:54,795
They tortured me. Did
unspeakable things to me.

970
01:39:55,463 --> 01:39:58,636
I'm on my last legs. The bastards.

971
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:03,228
Clark Nova, where is Joan? Where's Joan?

972
01:40:04,814 --> 01:40:08,615
Hans's old drug factory in the medina.

973
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:10,785
Fadela is there.

974
01:40:11,036 --> 01:40:16,296
Fadela is your point of
penetration into Interzone, Inc.

975
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,385
Fadela.

976
01:40:19,552 --> 01:40:22,184
What do I do when I find her?

977
01:40:22,267 --> 01:40:26,232
You'll know what to
do when the time comes.

978
01:40:26,316 --> 01:40:28,362
Just remember this...

979
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:34,041
all agents defect and
all resisters sell out.

980
01:40:35,042 --> 01:40:37,338
That's the sad truth, Bill.

981
01:40:37,421 --> 01:40:43,266
And a writer... a writer lives
the sad truth like anyone else.

982
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:48,152
The only difference is...
he files a report on it.

983
01:40:49,696 --> 01:40:53,329
Leave me now, before it's too late.

984
01:40:53,413 --> 01:40:56,669
But wait. What about
Joan? What about Joan?

985
01:40:56,752 --> 01:41:00,427
Go now! Vaya con dios.

986
01:41:00,552 --> 01:41:03,432
Clark Nova. Clark Nova!

987
01:42:22,924 --> 01:42:25,012
Hurry. Hurry.

988
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:29,645
Come on.

989
01:42:38,331 --> 01:42:41,628
Your notes must be much
more carefully detailed

990
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:46,136
to be of any use to us.
You must write very clearly.

991
01:42:46,638 --> 01:42:50,062
The effects of the
drugs must be cataloged

992
01:42:50,145 --> 01:42:52,776
with painstaking accuracy.

993
01:43:12,273 --> 01:43:14,695
Joan.

994
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:18,034
Bill.

995
01:43:18,786 --> 01:43:20,874
Oh, Bill.

996
01:43:30,727 --> 01:43:33,440
What is that? What are you writing?

997
01:43:33,648 --> 01:43:35,737
I'm writing...

998
01:43:36,489 --> 01:43:38,575
"All is lost.

999
01:43:39,745 --> 01:43:41,832
All is lost."

1000
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:44,671
It's all I've ever written.

1001
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:51,685
No.

1002
01:43:51,769 --> 01:43:53,856
Oh, Joan.

1003
01:43:55,275 --> 01:43:57,404
We have to see Fadela.

1004
01:43:58,324 --> 01:44:00,410
Take me to Fadela.

1005
01:44:20,827 --> 01:44:26,045
Lee, you're here. Thank God. Thank God.

1006
01:44:26,129 --> 01:44:30,345
You see, my misdemeanor
has borne sweet fruit.

1007
01:44:30,429 --> 01:44:32,559
Now you are with us.

1008
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:36,735
I was right to approach you so brazenly.

1009
01:44:36,818 --> 01:44:40,699
And now Dr. Benway
will have no choice...

1010
01:44:40,782 --> 01:44:43,663
- Benway.
- Benway.

1011
01:44:45,877 --> 01:44:48,048
You'll see.

1012
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:15,853
I got to say I'm proud of you, sir.

1013
01:45:15,937 --> 01:45:18,441
It took you a while, but
you got us red-handed.

1014
01:45:18,525 --> 01:45:21,407
Full marks, boy. Full marks.

1015
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:27,501
I expected to see an operation
all out for the black meat here.

1016
01:45:27,584 --> 01:45:29,756
What's with all the Mugwump jism?

1017
01:45:31,928 --> 01:45:34,057
The black meat concession
turns out to have

1018
01:45:34,141 --> 01:45:37,229
some unfortunate
political strings attached.

1019
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:39,609
We've just cut those strings.

1020
01:45:39,692 --> 01:45:43,951
From now on, Interzone is
strictly Mugwump territory.

1021
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:47,334
As you can see, we've
made a flying start here

1022
01:45:47,417 --> 01:45:49,378
with our modest dispensary.

1023
01:45:50,465 --> 01:45:53,845
I can feel the heat
closing in on you, Fadela.

1024
01:45:53,928 --> 01:45:57,394
Feel them out there making
their moves, you dig?

1025
01:45:57,478 --> 01:46:01,903
Fadela.

1026
01:46:05,828 --> 01:46:08,542
You mean this old thing.

1027
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,486
Benway!

1028
01:46:24,908 --> 01:46:27,913
We met once before, remember? Stateside.

1029
01:46:30,253 --> 01:46:33,551
You don't remember.
You had that look, boy.

1030
01:46:34,886 --> 01:46:38,853
The look of a... sheep-killing dog.

1031
01:46:39,145 --> 01:46:42,318
Decided to recruit
you right on the spot.

1032
01:46:42,402 --> 01:46:45,032
I'm afraid I was forced
by the tenor of the times

1033
01:46:45,115 --> 01:46:48,621
to prescribe that wretched black
meat powder to start you off on...

1034
01:46:48,705 --> 01:46:52,423
but the hole-in-the-wall
operation, limited resources...

1035
01:46:52,506 --> 01:46:55,136
you understand the problems.

1036
01:46:55,219 --> 01:47:00,938
But I understand from Cloquet that
you're on to our good stuff now.

1037
01:47:01,022 --> 01:47:03,819
Mugwump jism can't be beat.

1038
01:47:03,903 --> 01:47:08,203
And as you can see, we've got
ourselves a few more friends now.

1039
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:13,338
And a few more dollars, too.

1040
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,933
This little... Fadela number
is something I developed

1041
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:23,734
during my tenure as chief physician
to the prime minister of Annexia.

1042
01:47:23,818 --> 01:47:28,953
"El Primo" liked to walk the streets
amongst his people in drag, and...

1043
01:47:29,496 --> 01:47:33,253
Well, one thing led to another.

1044
01:47:37,385 --> 01:47:41,436
It-s an elegant way to strike
terror into the hearts of the enemy,

1045
01:47:41,519 --> 01:47:43,107
wouldn't you say?

1046
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:47,115
Old Fadela must be on the rag.

1047
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:50,036
She's been acting subversive lately.

1048
01:47:52,835 --> 01:47:56,424
Speaking of new uses for old technology,

1049
01:47:56,507 --> 01:48:00,599
I think the new order could find
a place for a man of your caliber.

1050
01:48:00,682 --> 01:48:02,771
A 32, wasn't it?

1051
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:06,528
That is what you're here for, isn't it?

1052
01:48:06,612 --> 01:48:11,037
Hell... I could use a reliable
man to send to Annexia.

1053
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:15,212
We're expanding, boy.
I need a spearhead.

1054
01:48:16,799 --> 01:48:19,595
Just tell me what you want.

1055
01:48:21,642 --> 01:48:23,729
I want her.

1056
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:27,655
Her?

1057
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:32,329
That purulent little cunt? What for?

1058
01:48:33,915 --> 01:48:36,712
I can't write without her.

1059
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:47,401
Bill, I feel confident that you
and I can work something out.

1060
01:49:20,342 --> 01:49:22,053
Papers, please.

1061
01:49:22,136 --> 01:49:26,020
What is the purpose of your
visit and what is your profession?

1062
01:49:26,103 --> 01:49:28,108
I write reports. I'm a writer

1063
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,696
and I intend to write
reports on life in Annexia

1064
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,659
for the citizens of the U.S.A.

1065
01:49:32,992 --> 01:49:34,746
Do you have any proof of what you say?

1066
01:49:34,829 --> 01:49:38,169
How do we know you are really a writer?

1067
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:42,761
- I have a writing device.
- That's not good enough.

1068
01:49:43,973 --> 01:49:46,060
Show us.

1069
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,609
- Show you.
- Write something.

1070
01:49:55,035 --> 01:49:57,249
- Write something.
- Yes.

1071
01:49:57,332 --> 01:49:59,420
Write something.

1072
01:50:15,453 --> 01:50:18,499
Joan. Joan.

1073
01:50:23,552 --> 01:50:27,268
What is it, Bill? Are we there yet?

1074
01:50:28,394 --> 01:50:30,482
Almost, Joan.

1075
01:50:32,904 --> 01:50:36,411
But I guess it's about time
for our William Tell routine.

1076
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:40,126
Sure, Bill.

1077
01:51:33,401 --> 01:51:36,072
Welcome to Annexia.

1078
01:51:36,823 --> 01:51:40,539
Yes. Welcome to Annexia.
