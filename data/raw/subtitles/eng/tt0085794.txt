161
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>I dropped it there before
they dragged me out of the car.</i>

162
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,953
<i>Those guys really hurt me. I think
that was a bit much. I really do.</i>

163
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,339
- How did you get this number?
<i>MASHA: Don't be angry with me, Jerry.</i>

164
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,378
- I said, how did you get this number?
<i>MASHA: I didn't know what else to do.</i>

165
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,381
(UNHOOKS PHONE)

166
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,840
How have you been, Rita?

167
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,758
- Do I know you?
- I think you might.

168
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,890
Rupert.

169
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,525
- Rupert Pupkin, right?
- Right.

170
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,355
I brought you a little present.

171
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,610
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Mr. Romance, heh.

172
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,531
RUPERT: Put an aspirin in that.
It'll last longer.

173
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,126
So, what are you up to these days?

174
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,338
You're looking as
beautiful as ever, Rita.

175
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,876
Well, here I am.
Local cheerleader makes good.

176
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:04,673
You know, it's funny, but I...
I, uh, voted for you, Most Beautiful.

177
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,099
Did you? That was sweet.

178
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,960
I didn't have the nerve
to tell you then, but...

179
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,063
Yeah, now you can tell me.
It's okay, we're both adults.

180
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,025
When you're younger, you're
afraid to say those things...

181
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,482
but when you get older,
15-, 20 years later...

182
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,148
you can say all those things that you
should have said 15-, 20 years ago.

183
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,195
Isn't that the final
irony of life? Isn't it?

184
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,909
I guess.

185
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,285
Are you happy in this place, Rita?

186
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,419
- Why? You got something better?
- Maybe.

187
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,801
- Oh, really? Like what?
- Well, what are you doing tonight?

188
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,758
- What am I doing tonight?
- Yeah. What's so funny?

189
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,968
(CHUCKLES)

190
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,226
It only took you 15 years to ask me for a
date. Don't you think it's a little late?

191
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,102
(LAUGHS)

192
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,935
Really? Well...

193
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,776
Waiter? Can I have a fresh one?

194
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,066
Rita.

195
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,947
Who is your favorite movie star?

196
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,197
(CHUCKLES)

197
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,828
This some kind of a game? You gonna tell me
something about my character, my future?

198
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:13,833
You'll see. Tell me. Everybody
has a favorite movie star.

199
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,995
Well, I better come up with somebody
or we'll never get out of here, right?

200
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,629
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

201
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,668
- That's a little test, heh.
- Let's see. Marilyn Monroe.

202
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,179
Perfect.

203
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,398
Talent register, huh?

204
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,983
That's her name.

205
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,991
She signed this when she was in New York
on her publicity tour for <i>The Misfits.</i>

206
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,322
- That was her last movie, you know.
- Yeah?

207
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:54,829
She wasn't a great actress, but she
did have a real gift for comedy.

208
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,041
She died tragically alone, like many
of the world's most beautiful women.

209
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,956
I don't wanna see that
happening to you.

210
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,841
(SCOFFS)

211
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,342
- Who's this?
- Burt Reynolds.

212
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,473
- This?
- Mel Brooks.

213
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,512
He's what you call "on" funny.
Others are just regular.

214
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,524
That's Sid Caesar. He's remarkable.
I really like him. He's great.

215
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,276
Woody Allen. He's a
personal friend of mine.

216
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,780
- Of course he is.
- Ha, ha. No, he is.

217
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,822
That's Ernie Kovacs.
He was wonderful.

218
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:34,285
He was a great comedian, a great
innovator, and it was a great, great loss.

219
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,575
Oh, I bet some of these
are worth money.

220
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,541
Oh, yeah. Especially this one.
Just hold it.

221
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,094
- Who's this?
- Well, just take a guess.

222
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,723
- Heh, it looks like a retard wrote this.
RUPERT: Ha-ha-ha.

223
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,556
The more scribbled the name,
the bigger the fame.

224
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,431
That might be true,
Rupert, but who is it?

225
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,066
"R" is the first letter.

226
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,149
- Come on, Rupert. Who is it? I'm tired.
- Well, I'll give you a little hint.

227
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,527
- R...?
- Robert Redford.

228
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,736
(RUPERT CHUCKLING)

229
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,321
No.

230
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,245
No, no.

231
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,906
That's Rupert Pupkin.

232
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,585
Rupert Pupkin.

233
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,669
I surprised you, didn't I?

234
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,096
Take this as a gift.

235
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,603
Take good care of that. In a few
weeks, everyone's gonna want one.

236
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,638
Rupert, you have not changed.

237
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,935
Just a couple of hours ago, do you
know who I was talking to? Guess.

238
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,939
- Your shrink?
- Heh, that's very funny.

239
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,780
No. Jerry Langford.
That's right. The Jerry Langford.

240
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,785
He gave me the go-ahead, Rita.

241
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,945
(RITA SIGHING)

242
00:19:56,112 --> 00:20:00,618
You know what? Don't tell anyone yet, but
you're looking at the new King of Comedy.

(RITA CHUCKLING)

244
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,750
Why not me? Why not?

245
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,916
A guy can get anything he wants,
as long as he pays the price.

246
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:11,803
What's so funny about that? I mean,
crazier things have happened.

247
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,635
You don't understand
what a shot on Langford means.

248
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,891
That's coast-to-coast
national TV...

249
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,895
a bigger audience than the greatest
comedians played to in a whole lifetime.

250
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,306
A shot at a free ticket
on the comedy circuit.

251
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,477
A comedy show of my own.
<i>The Rupert Pupkin</i> Show. Everything.

252
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,112
All that leads in one
direction: Hollywood.

253
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,775
A beach house in Malibu on the ocean.
And we'll keep a suite at the Sherry.

254
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,821
Everybody stays there when they make it big.
Up top, so we can look down and yell:

255
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,491
"Hey, tough luck, suckers!
Better luck next time."

256
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,500
Come on. What do you say?

257
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,004
It sounds wonderful, Rupert,
and I wish you the best of luck.

258
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,963
But it's getting late and I'm a
working girl. I gotta go home.

259
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,346
I don't get you.
Here I am offering you a way out.

260
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,633
Rita, every king needs a queen.

261
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,143
I want you to be mine.

262

263
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,233
This is a nice street.
Nice building.

264
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,860
- Thanks for your jacket, Rupert.
- Oh.

265
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,489
I guess you're entitled
to come up and have some coffee.

266
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,242
Oh, no, I wouldn't
wanna impose, really.

267
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,870
- I know I can be...
- What do you want, Rupert?

268
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,530
What?

269
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,999
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,711
Rita, you still don't understand?
I love you.

271
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:35,003
I wanna help change your life,
if you'll just give me a chance.

272
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,840
What if I set something up
between me, you and Jerry?

273
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,886
What if we went out to dinner
one night? What do you think?

274
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:47,603
You know what's even better? We'll go
to his summer house for a weekend.

275
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,894
- He wouldn't wanna meet me.
- That's not true.

276
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,067
Jerry is a very nice guy.

277
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,780
He's a very, very nice guy,
and we had a terrific meeting.

278
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,681
You shouldn't sell yourself short.

279
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:02,723
You have too little faith, and
you're a wonderful person.

280
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:09,879
Why don't you go to sleep
and get a good night's rest, okay?

281
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,836
Okay.

282
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,377
- Good night, Rupert.
- Good night.

283
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,718
Go to sleep right away.

00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,109
Hi, Liza. Good seeing you.

286
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,902
Jerry, good seeing you.
Jerry. Don't get up.

287
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,287
Ah, oh, boy, I'll tell you.

288
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,573
Every time you come
back from a tour...

289
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,118
there must be something in the air
or the tour, it really becomes you.

290
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,959
It's like you become rejuvenated.
I don't know what it is.

291
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,091
Isn't that so, everybody?
Isn't that so?

292
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,174
Heh, that's the truth. I'll tell you.
It's amazing. You look wonderful.

293
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:04,137
Yeah, I know. You look wonderful too,
Jerry. I wasn't leaving you out, heh.

294
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,140
What? Yeah!

00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,106
Oh, Jerry. I love this guy. Always
coming up with these great lines.

297
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,776
I love him. I love him.
He's wonderful. You're wonderful.

298
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,286
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

MOTHER: Rupert! The bus is here.
It's early. Try to be on time for once!

300
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,830
I can't believe this. Ha, ha, I gotta
go now. Yeah, I gotta catch a bus.

301
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:38,593
Jerry, take care of yourself.
Baby, be good. Good luck in Rio.

- Good morning, Rupert.
- Good morning.

00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,603
- How are you?
- This is for you.

304
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,230
Work.

305
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,609
- What time is it?
- It's 10:00.

306
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,942
Is it 10 o'clock? Could I use
the phone for one second?

307
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,151
- Is it local?
- Yeah.

308
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,942
Sure. Just dial 9 first,
and make it short.

Yes.

Well, just tell him it's Rupert calling,
and he'll know what it's about. Thank you.

316
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,892
Oh. Oh, he is? Well, that's okay.
I'm in a meeting myself.

317
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:41,189
Uh, just tell him I called. Thank you very
much. And I'll call later. Thank you. Bye.

that are essential to the smooth
functioning of our operation. Right?

636
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,445
- If I could just say that...
- Now, just listen, please. Okay?

637
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,954
And that without these rules, we really
wouldn't be able to function at our best.

638
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,332
- You follow my point?
- I get the point, except...

639
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,993
- Please, Mr. Puffer.
- After you.

640
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,663
- After you, sir, please.
- If I could just say that Jerry is...

641
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,301
Just listen to me. I checked with Miss Long.
You do not have an appointment.

642
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,635
Now, company policy is that
only authorized personnel...

643
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,518
and those persons with official
business with our organization...

644
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,520
are permitted on our premises.

645
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,353
In other words, you want me
to leave the building?

646
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,924
MASHA: Well? Did you get it to him?
RUPERT: What?

647
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,639
- Did you get my letter to him?
- He's not in there, okay?

648
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,051
Now that you're so in with him,
you can't do me a favor? Don't bother.

649
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,686
Just give me the letter.
I'll find somebody else.

650
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:35,394
- He wasn't there.
- I saw him go in myself.

651
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,558
- Who?
- Jerry!

652
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,854
- He's up there right now. Wanna see him?
- That's impossible.

653
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,567
They assured me that he was out.

654
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,028
- And you believed them?
- Mm-hm.

655
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,240
You're so naive.
I would expect that from you.

656
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,700
So inexperienced.
You're such a chump.

657
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,037
- He went up there just now?
- Of course. Go back up.

658
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,919
Assert yourself a little bit.
He's up there right now.

659
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,137
Oh, no.

660
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,302
- Would you tell Jerry I'm here?
- I'm sorry, he's not in.

661
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,064
- I know he is. Would you tell him I'm here?
- I'm sorry, he's not in.

662
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,818
You're putting your job on
the line, lady. You hear me?

663
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,774
Security.

664
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,531
You too.

665
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,838
CATHY: Mr. Pupkin, what
are you doing here?

666
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,470
Mr. Pupkin?

667
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,725
Mr. Pupkin.

668
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,687
Get security on the telephone.

669
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,729
WIRTZ: There he goes.

670
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,277
Hold on. Grab his other arm.
Hold on to him.

671
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,321
Right. All right,
right out the door.

672
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,790
You wouldn't listen, huh?

673
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,166
Jerry? Jerry?

674
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,111
WIRTZ: Nobody's gonna help you.

675
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:22,901
You're gonna have a lot
of explaining to do.

676
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,008
WIRTZ: You had your warning, Krupkin.
- My lawyer'll be calling you.

677
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,885
WIRTZ:
Make sure he gets my name right.

678
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:34,467
- Say goodbye to our guest, Miss Long.
- Wait till Jerry hears about this.

679
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,011
WIRTZ: I will mention your
name to Jerry, Pupper.

680
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:43,105
Listen good, because if we see your face
again, we're gonna call the police.

681
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:48,026
Thank you. Thank you
very much, heh, heh.

682
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,283
Terrific. I suppose
that you got the letter to him?

683
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,570
- No, but I'll get it later.
- Great.

684
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:57,491
- You just got thrown out of the building.
- I didn't get thrown out.

685
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,374
- What do you call that?
- I didn't.

686
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,002
Excuse me. I wasn't thrown
out of the building.

687
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,711
- You're a constant embarrassment.
- They walked me outside.

688
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:10,344
- You can't handle the simplest things.
- I'll tell you something else. I'm going...

689
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:14,132
- Jerry invited me for the weekend.
- Great. I'll go with you.

690
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,014
Do I look okay?

691
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,396
- Wonderful.
- Does this look all right?

692
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,807
- That, I'm not sure about.
- What do you mean?

693
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,396
- You look wonderful.
- What's wrong with it?

694
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,561
Nothing. I just don't
think you need it.

695
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:31,198
- You don't think it looks nice on me?
- No, it looks wonderful.

696
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,583
Hello.

697
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,969
RUPERT: You must be Jonno.
- Uh, yes.

698
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,425
My name is Rupert Pupkin
and this is Rita Keane.

699
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,967
- Would you let Jerry know we're here?
- Mr. Langford asked you to come?

700
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,602
No, we just thought we'd drop
in uninvited for the weekend.

(RUPERT & RITA CHUCKLE)

702
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:06,442
Come on in. We'll be staying in
separate rooms. The blue bag is mine.

703
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,571
- But Mr. Langford's not here.
- Where is he? Out playing golf?

704
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,151
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

705
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,659
- I hope he's finally gonna break 100.
- A hundred?

706
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:19,072
- Perhaps better you come back.
- No, we'll just wait.

707
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:23,493
- But Mr. Langford is not here.
- That's okay. We'll just wait.

708
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,912
That's okay. We don't mind waiting.

709
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,126
Isn't this lovely?

710
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,086
Table's only set for one.

711
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,808
- How do you like it?
- I could live here.

712
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,814
Mr. Langford, I'm sorry
to disturb you, sir.

713
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,648
Uh, what's wrong? Everything's wrong.
There are a couple over here.

714
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:55,158
His name is Pumpkin. Pumpkin, yes.
Do you know a name Pumpkin?

715
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,822
Didn't you tell him what
time we'd get here?

716
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,162
We didn't have time to iron out
the details. We're the first guests.

717
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,668
But that butler wasn't
even expecting us.

718
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,832
Jerry does have more important things to
think about than what to tell his houseboy.

719
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,501
Really? Well, excuse me.

720
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,222
He knows everything. He knew you
were playing golf and everything.

721
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,730
Uh, I don't know what he want. He wanna
spend the weekend over here. Yes.

722
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:31,440
And you better come back. He's touching
everything. He's ruining the house.

723
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,525
And I'm getting a
heart attack already.

724
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,363
Here's a famous one with the youngest clown
in the world, Zippo. Clown for a day.

725
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,699
Remember this one with
Ray Charles on Jerry's special?

726
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,864
- That's famous.
- I know. There it is.

727
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,830
Here's a famous one when he
was a kid, 12 years old.

728
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:51,372
Someone sent this in as a part of the
show, "I Knew You When" section.

729
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:56,214
They thought they were playing a joke. Now
Jerry shows it to everyone on the show.

this place. It's like a funeral parlor.

732

<i>Jump off into the ocean</i>

733
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,726
You should really turn that off. You
shouldn't put that on. It's not polite.

734
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,396
- How about a little spin, handsome?
- We shouldn't be dancing.

735
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,907
- A little fun never hurt anybody.
- What if Jerry walks in?

736
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,990
He'll be happy to see
us having a good time.

737
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,077
- What if he walks in?
- So? You're his friend. He won't mind.

<i>Oh, one day...</i>

740
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,354
I wonder what the rest
of this place is like.

741
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,616
Well, I'm sure it's very nice.

742
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,798
No, Rita, I wouldn't go up there.

743
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,592
- Rita? Rita?
RITA: Come on.

744
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,806
I don't think it's a good idea.

745
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:52,309
Rita, they're watching us. Rita, I don't
think you have the right to go upstairs.

746
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,272
Rita, please don't go up there.

00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:07,657
Would you open the goddamn door?
I was standing out there eight minutes.

750
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:11,168
What was with the door? Jesus!
Where are they?

751
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,795
JONNO: I was gonna call the police,
but I wait for you.

752
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:19,757
Hi, Jerry. Hi, Jerry. How are you?
We were just freshening up upstairs.

753
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:24,845
Rita, I want you to meet the Jerry Langford.
Jerry, I want you to meet the Rita Keane.

754
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:28,762
Come on down. Don't be ashamed.

What's your pleasure, Jerry?

00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:35,960
It's hot out there.

757
00:56:35,986 --> 00:56:40,598
I wanna get something nice to drink.
Jerry, what would you like? Jer?

758
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,284
Jer?

759
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:50,166
Excuse us, but it's not every day that
a girl like Rita meets a man like you.

760
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:53,578
I mean, this is part of your success.
You have to live with it.

761
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,998
How was your golf game? Was it good?
Did you finally break 100?

762
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,338
JONNO: I told them you were not here.
COOK: That's right, he did.

763
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,878
Yes, they did. They were
really very helpful.

764
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,970
We took an earlier train. There wasn't
anything else until after 1, so...

765
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:12,184
Anyway, I brought the work. It's right
here. All ready. All ready and set to go.

766
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,976
So...

767
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,230
where is everybody?

768
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:22,197
- What everybody?
- Heh, what everybody? The guests, Jer.

769
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:25,109
To tell you the truth,
we're getting a little hungry.

770
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,527
You know I could have the
both of you arrested?

00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,120
He could have us arrested. Of
course you could have us arrested.

There's no way we can
prove that we belong here.

with an idea, he's terrific.

- Really, I never thought of that.
- You should have.

00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,868
We can set up a story
where you invite all your

777
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,988
friends out and you
throw them all in jail!

to work on that. After this, of course.

782
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,901
We walked in the door. What do you
mean? What's the matter with you?

783

How did you get here?

00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,198
I think you're upset.
I'm gonna leave my material here.

We'll talk later. You've got more
important things to worry about.

wait till lunchtime.

you you're a moron?

You know, Jerry,
I wanna tell you something.

789
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,794
Ordinarily I wouldn't allow anybody
to speak that way about Rita.

790
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,760
But since it's you, I know you're only
kidding. He's a real character.

00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,685
- Rupert, he's saying he wants us to go.
- No, he's not saying that.

792
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,565
Jerry, tell her that. You're not saying
that. He's not saying that at all.

793
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,897
- Call the station, Jonno.
- Where are you going? Rita?

794
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,905
There'll be a cab here in five or 10
minutes. Wait at the gate and use it.

795
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,441
Why? You going someplace, heh?

796
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,451
JERRY: No, you are.

797
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:56,288
Did I say something wrong, Jerry? Because if
I did, could we chalk it up to inexperience?

798
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,123
Rita?

799
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:02,460
I have my stuff right here.
We could do it in a half an hour.

800
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,341
Then you'd have the rest of
the afternoon to yourself.

801
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:10,841
I want you out of here. I want you out
of here now. Is that plain enough?

802
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,508
- I understand.
- Is that clear?

803
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,349
Yeah, yeah. I understand.
Look, you're tired. That's okay.

804
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,266
I'm gonna leave the stuff here. Read
it and let me know what you think.

805
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,732
Don't be so dopey. Use your ears.
The man is telling us to go.

806
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,817
He is not telling us to go.
Will you stop?

807
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:29,654
- Mr. Langford, I knew nothing about this.
- Tell her she's wrong, Jerry.

808
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,787
I don't even know him. I haven't seen him
in years. He told me you were friends.

809
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,162
RUPERT: Rita!

810
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,952
I feel terrible. I'm so humiliated.
If there's anything I can do...

811
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,041
Don't listen. She works in a bar.
She wants to spoil everything.

812
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,502
Come on, Rupert. Let's go.

813
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:49,170
- Jerry...
- Okay, come on. Come on, come on.

814
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,509
- Let's go.
- Sorry, Mr. Langford.

815
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:55,801
- Here you are. Take your things and go!
- All right, I can take a hint, Jerry.

816
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,847
I just want you to listen to my stuff for
15 minutes. Is that asking too much?

817
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,266
Yes, it is. I have a life, okay?

818
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,481
- I have a life too.
- That's not my responsibility.

819
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:10,195
- It is when you tell me to call you.
- I told you to call to get rid of you!

820
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,201
- To get rid of me? Okay, I can take a hint.
- That's right.

821
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,785
If I didn't tell you that, we'd still
be on the steps at my apartment!

822
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,791
- All right, so I made a mistake.
- So did Hitler!

823
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,707
All right. This is the way
it is when you're famous.

824
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,544
- You understand?
- Now I see. That's how you guys are, huh?

825
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,550
- Not them. Me. Yeah!
- That's how you are.

826
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,713
- When you reach the top.
- No, I was that way before.

827
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,678
- Now I know how people like you are.
JERRY: Goodbye and good luck!

828
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,388
RUPERT: Goodbye.

829
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:41,727
And, Jerry. Jerry, I just wanna
say one more thing, Jerry.

830
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:46,894
I'm glad what you did to me today. Because
now I know I can't rely on anybody.

831
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,610
Not you, not anybody.
And I shouldn't rely on anybody.

832
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:55,073
And you wanna know something else?
I'm gonna work 50 times harder...

833
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,704
and I'm gonna be 50 times
more famous than you.

834
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,537
Then you're gonna have idiots
like you plaguing your life!

835
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:04,875
That's right. Yes. Come on, Rita. We're
wasting our time. Goodbye, Jerry.

836
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,915
Jonno, lock that door.

837
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,970
- You did good, Mr. Langford.
- Thank you.

838
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,102
It looks real.

839
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,225

RUPERT: Is that him?
MASHA: No.

842
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,453
RUPERT: You sure?
- Sure, I'm sure. It looks too much like him.

843
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:42,583
- What do you mean?
- When it's him, it doesn't look like him.

844
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,247
God, it feels like it's
taking him forever.

845
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,630
How much longer?

846
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,551
It's him.

847
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,886
RUPERT: Yeah, that's him.

848
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,272
- Don't go too fast.
MASHA: Okay, okay.

849
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,812
RUPERT: Stay on this side
so you're not all over him.

850
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,653
MASHA: I'm getting over as soon as I can.
- Get in the next lane.

851
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,909
MASHA: Okay, okay, okay.

852
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:22,953
RUPERT: Not yet. There are too many people.
- I know. I'll keep going.

853
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,210
He walks in the most crowded areas.
You'd think he'd wanna stay away.

854
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,792
Well, because he doesn't
wanna be alone.

855
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:34,085
Why? Tell me why.
I know. You tell me why.

856
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,843
Don't get an attitude with me.

857
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,054
Explain it to me, because
you know so much about him.

858
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,515
Fill me in. Let me learn from you.

859
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:49,354
All right. Because when he walks on crowded
streets, he feels safe, that's why.

860
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,645
Is that what it is?
Thanks for telling me.

861
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,530
Okay, go past him and stop.

862
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:11,501
Okay, Jerry. Get over. Get in
there. I'm not fooling around.

863
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:15,884
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Get in, Jerry. Get in.

864
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,382

hold a gun on your head.

01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,855
Don't make any false moves.
I'd hate to do anything drastic.

868
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:34,145
Now, if everything works out, you should be
out of here by the very latest 12-, 12:30.

869
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:38,573
Well, maybe 1-, 1:15
at the very latest.

870
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:42,032
What I want you to do
is call your producer.

871
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,912
- Call what?
- Bert Thomas. I want you to call him.

872
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,870
I'm gonna give you
a phone right now.

873
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:52,163
Get him on the phone, and I'll tell
you exactly what to say, okay?

874
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:58,423
Now, if you don't do it,
I don't know what to say.

875
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,088
There could be a problem.

876
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:07,645
Watch your eyes, Jerry. I'm gonna take these
off now. It's a little bright in here, okay?

877
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,531
Okay.

878
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,122
Are these yours?

879
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,712
- Jerry, these are yours?
- Yeah.

880
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,918
- Do you mind if I have one?
- I don't mind.

881
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,131
Thank you.

882
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,046
- Masha, do you want one?
- Save it for me.

883
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,762
RUPERT: You want one?
- I'd love one, but will you save it?

884
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,428
It's a little bit inconvenient at
the moment. Thank you, Rupert.

885
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,313
- Do you want one?
- No.

886
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,975
I'll just take one for later then.

887
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,781
There's no reason to get mad.
I'm just trying to ease the tension.

strange situation...

Why did they hang up?

Probably thought it was a gag.
We get that all the time.

Well, I find that
strange, you know.

901
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:08,348
But it's typical. Because that's
the way they treat even you.

902

Because I'll let you
in on a little secret.

It's serious. Now, move it!

- Like what?

an impression of me on the phone...

927
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:46,150
the only way they're gonna know
it's really me is by that clue.

928
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,782

then he would know it's not me.

- They'll do whatever you want.
- Okay, that was very good, Jerry.

950
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,128
MASHA: Turn around,
let's see how it looks.

951
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:37,925
Oh, I love it. I'm sorry.
The sleeves aren't quite right.

952
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:41,015
Do you like it on him?
What do you think?

953
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,930
I think it looks pretty good.

954
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:48,102
To guess on it and have it turn out
like this, I'm very pleased with it.

955
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,646
The color's great, and I like to see
him more casual for a change.

956
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:56,614
This is a look I like to see on him.
Not so uptight, not so...

957
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,450
- Okay. I gotta get started here.
- What do you think?

958
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,161
- It's wonderful. It's very good.
- Be honest with me.

959
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:05,122
- I'm being honest.
- Would you wear it?

960
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:10,290
I like it. I'm so glad I went with red.
It looks so good on him.

961
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,175
- It looks good, Jerry.
- Gorgeous. Mm.

962
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:14,631
RUPERT: Come on.
MASHA: What?

963
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:17,422
RUPERT: Take it off and let's go.
MASHA: Oh, okay.

964
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:23,095
You want me to take it off? Why can't
he wear it for a little while?

965
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,309
Will you take it off, please?

966
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:30,102
I know he's in a meeting, but this is
an emergency and I gotta talk to him.

967
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:34,648
You'll interrupt him, or I'm gonna
come busting into that meeting.

968
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:38,152
No. Forget calling me back.
I'm on my way.

969
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,164
Why didn't you listen to the tape when I
asked you to? It wasn't that hard, was it?

970
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:47,327
A few minutes of your time to listen to
something that I worked on my whole life.

971
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:52,499
If that's what's behind all this, let's go to
my office and we'll play the tape right now.

972
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:56,044
Are you crazy? You know what would
happen to me if I went there now?

973
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,305
- I'm not stupid.
- Nobody's calling you stupid.

974
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,512
You pulled this off.
That makes you smart.

975
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,848
You know, Jerry,
I'm gonna tell you something.

976
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,979
Friendship is a two-way street.

977
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:12,186
You know that? And you couldn't
have cared less about me.

978
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:16,197
Am I gonna hold this till next Shavuoth?
You gonna make some decisions here?

979
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:19,655
You gonna knock off
the talking for two minutes?

980
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,070
When you put the sweater on,
was I bothering you, huh?

981
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,455
It took one minute.
You have a long night ahead.

982
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,584
RUPERT: I have something to say.
- You've got more than enough to say.

983
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:32,999
You're driving me nuts. Can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute and let me rest?

984
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:36,384
With this gun?
You're driving me crazy!

985
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,216
You have not shut up since
we walked into my house.

986
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,551
This is my house.
This is my domain.

987
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:45,344
Jerry is my guest and you're my guest,
and you're lucky to be here!

988
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,356
You get to change in my house, you get
your head together for the show tonight.

989
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:53,064
Why don't you give me a little break?
Why can't you give me a break? Shut up!

990
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:57,231
RUPERT: You shut up. I did give you a break.
I listened to you talk about that sweater.

991
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:01,071
Worrying about the sleeves,
the color. Did I say anything?

992
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:04,238
I didn't make it for you. I made it
for Jerry. It looks fabulous.

993
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:08,624
Whose idea was this anyway? If it wasn't
for me, you wouldn't even be here.

994
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:13,584
Why didn't you listen to the tape when
I asked you to? Was that so hard to do?

995
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:19,253
I'm sure you can understand, doing the kind
of show I'm doing, it's mind-boggling.

996
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:22,922
There's so much stuff that comes down,
you can't keep your head clear.

997
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,933
And if that's the case, I'm wrong.

998
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,936
You're right, I'm wrong.
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

999
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:34,435
I'm just a human being, with all of
the foibles and all of the traps.

1000
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,571
The show, the pressure, the groupies,
the autograph hounds, the crew.

1001
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:41,949
The incompetents behind the scenes
you think are your friends...

1002
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,453
and you're not sure if you're gonna
be there tomorrow because of them.

1003
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:50,583
Wonderful pressures that make every day
a glowing, radiant day in your life.

1004
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:55,121
It's terrific. Okay. If all
of that means nothing...

1005
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,916
if I'm wrong,
in spite of all that...

1006
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,301
then I apologize, I'm sorry.

1007
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:06,303
If you accept my apology, I think we should
shake hands and we'll forget the whole thing.

1008
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:12,723
I won't press charges. You two could be in
deep trouble, but I will not press charges.

1009
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,940
- Ahh, that's easy for you to say, Jerry.
JERRY: But I mean it.

1010
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:21,857
I mean, I'll go to the office
and tell them all it's a gag.

1011
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:25,402
They'll understand that. If I tell
them it's a gag, they're gonna buy it.

1012
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,082
And then we'll put the
tape on and listen...

1013
01:13:28,108 --> 01:13:29,894
Sit down! I said, sit down.

1014
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,624
You heard what he said.

1015
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:35,286
Yeah, right. All of a sudden with a
gun on him, he wants to be friends?

1016
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:39,208
- What happens when he walks out the door?
- What happens then, Jerry?

1017
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:43,094
- You get to his office, and they jump you.
- Is that what happens, Jerry?

1018
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,344
Not if I tell them not to. They won't
jump you. No one's gonna jump you.

1019
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:52,182
If I tell them to do something,
they do it. No one's gonna jump you.

1020
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:55,519
Now, that's the truth. You
have to take my word for it.

1021
01:13:55,681 --> 01:14:00,027
If you think I'm not telling you
the truth, then don't respond.

1022
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,907
If you think I'm telling you the truth,
then let me get the hell out of here.

1023
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,534
- He gives me his word.
- And what else?

1024
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,194
And what else, Jerry?

1025
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,116
There is nothing else.
Just my word.

1026
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,243
Isn't my word good enough?

1027
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,707
I'm sorry, Jerry.

1028
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:42,146
Suppose we tape him, he doesn't
talk, it gets to be 11:30.

1029
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,689
Do we put him on, no matter what?

1030
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:48,951
You can go ahead and tape him. It, uh, won't
hurt anything. You always can erase it.

1031
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:52,740
We may learn something from it
and, uh, it'll also buy us time.

1032
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,579
Under no circumstances will
we put this man on the air.

1033
01:14:55,741 --> 01:15:00,372
This lunatic is threatening Jerry's life
and you're not gonna put him on the air?

1034
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:05,795
Let's not get too excited. I don't
think you understand. We'll tape at 7.

1035
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,931
We won't have to make a decision about
putting him on the air till 11:30.

1036
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:15,596
This gives us four hours. Hopefully, by that
time, we'll have Mr. Langford back safely.

1037
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:20,267
Harry, that's it. We're suing. We're going
to sue. We're gonna sue everybody.

1038
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,777
- Who is this man?
- Jerry's lawyer.

1039
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:26,565
What do you mean, who am I?
I'm the one who's suing. I'm the lawyer.

1040
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,154
- Jay...
JAY: Don't "Jay" me, please. Do me a favor.

1041
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,614
Jay, who are you going to sue?

1042
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,779
You. We're suing you, personally!

1043
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,789
HARRY: Who else are you suing?
- The FBI.

1044
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:39,248
We have a serious situation and I
want it dealt with rationally.

1045
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,914
Unless we start talking politely,
there's gonna be serious consequences.

1046
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,777
JAY: There is nothing
polite about kidnapping.

1047
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:48,327
It is one of the most
stupid offenses ever.

1048
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:52,307
Where's the defense of kidnapping?
How can you say "I was crazy"?

1049
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,639
"I didn't know what I was doing.
I did it on the spur of the moment"?

1050
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:56,848
Jay, who cares?

1051
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:01,642
JAY: Only an idiot kidnaps. And only an idiot
decides to do what you guys are doing.

1052
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,778
Jerry, I'm gonna go now.

1053
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:19,747
Pretty soon you'll be able to go. About
12-, 12:30, as I said. Have a good time.

1054
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,290
I know you will, heh.

1055
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:23,875
Bye.

1056
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,880
First of all, we don't know whether we're
dealing with kidnappers or terrorists.

1057
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,845
Terrorists? Terrorists?
What do you mean, terrorists?

1058
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,477
You might have this man go on the
air, deliver a coded message...

1059
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,856
and possibly 50 people around the
country would lose their lives.

1060
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,109
- You're out of your mind!
- I'm not out of my mind.

1061
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,396
That guy is gonna be taped,
and we'll listen to what he says.

1062
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:52,863
Unless something horrendous is on that tape,
we're gonna put that tape on the air.

1063
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:58,532
All we're dealing with here is 10 minutes
of talk-show time against a man's life...

1064
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,870
and I don't see that
as any argument.

1065
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,413
Hello. How are you today?
Well, I'm calling...

1066
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:09,004
Mr. King calling collect
long distance for Mr. Thomas.

1067
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,215
Mr. Thomas, there's a
long-distance call.

1068
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,880
THOMAS: Let's go.

1069
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,970
MAN: If this is it, remember,
keep him talking.

1070
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,511
Uh, hi, there. Who is this?

1071
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:22,305
<i>RUPERT (OVER PHONE): This is Mr. King.
I'm calling for Mr. King.</i>

1072
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,519
Uh-huh. Well, you're right on time.

1073
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:28,357
Yes, of course. We're always
punctual. We're fine, thank you.

1074
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,897
I wanna make it brief,
and I wanna tell you...

1075
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:34,818
Could I break in and ask you,
could I speak to Jerry?

1076
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,409
No, Jerry's not with us. We're at a
payphone. Don't have the call traced.

1077
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,745
I noticed you just did. I heard
the sounds. I do know those sounds.

1078
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:47,380
It's kind of important, so that we know that
he's in... What'll I say?... your care?

1079
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:53,261
We've taken care of that by bringing along an
article of clothing that you will recognize.

1080
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:57,845
It is not as easy as you think just to walk
in the studio, go right on the show...

1081
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,385
No, Bert...
If I could call you, uh...

1082
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:05,352
Well, if I could just say, there is no
problem. The material is clean material.

1083
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:09,439
- Do you know of Standards and Practices?
<i>RUPERT: No, but that can be discussed.</i>

1084
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,606
All I can say is don't
have any press leaks.

1085
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:19,120
You must keep the audience there until 11:45
or 12:00, after it has been aired nationally.

1086
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:23,954
Thank you. We'll discuss the other things.
That's your problem. Nice talking to you.

1087
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:31,917
Boy, he's shrewd. He just,
uh, wouldn't buy anything.

1088
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:15,759
(SIGHS)

1089
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:32,192
I feel completely
impulsive tonight.

1090
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,945
Anything... Anything could happen.

1091
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,699
I have so much to tell you.
I don't know where to start.

1092
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:43,237
I wanna tell you everything about
myself, everything you don't know.

1093
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:49,957
Do you like these glasses? Crystal.
Beautiful. I bought them just for you.

1094
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,840
There's something about them.
Just the simplicity of them.

1095
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:58,174
But if you don't like them, if there's even

1251
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:51,971
But for one night I'd like to see
myself out of my head! Wouldn't you?

1252
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:54,731
Wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be fabulous?

1253
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,185
I'm having a good time.

1254
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:05,325
I'm having fun.

1255
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,612
Fun is my middle name.
I'm having fun.

1256
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:14,243
That's right. Having some fun.
Never had this much fun before.

1257
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,252
That's right.

1258
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:21,838
Good, old-fashioned,
all-American fun.

with guest host Tony Randall
and his special guests:

as always, Lou Brown and the orchestra

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. I have some sad news for you.

1269
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,302
AUDIENCE: Aw!

1270
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:11,638
Earlier today, my writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1272

No embarrassing display
of emotion, please.

1275
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:31,695
Instead we're going to do something a little
bit different this evening. A lot different.

1276
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,239
We're going to give you a glimpse...
Turn it over, please.

1277
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,784
AUDIENCE: Ha-ha-ha.
...Into the future.

1278

It isn't often you can call someone a
sure thing in the entertainment business.

1279
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:44,253
After all, the verdict is always
in your hands, isn't it?

1280
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:47,010
But I think tonight,
after you've met...

you'll agree with me that he's destined
for greatness, in one way or another.

1284

greetings to the newest King of Comedy...

1288

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Let me
introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1289
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:30,128
I can't believe I'm gonna kiss you.

1290
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,803
Masha.

1291
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:35,804
Take the tape off.

1292
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:38,770
Really?

1293
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,976
Go on. Take it off.

1294
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,323
- I'm ready now.
- Take him back down.

1295
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:51,574
With pleasure.

1296
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:55,738
Why did you do this? Tell me why and then
maybe I'll be able to believe in you.

1297
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,953
- Why did you do such a thing?
- Do you know what time it is?

1298
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,789
- It's five minutes to 11.
- I think we better go.

1299
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:06,832
Because otherwise-I don't like to say it
like this... Jerry's gonna be unavailable.

1300
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:10,377
- You'll understand when we go.
- I'll understand? Why will I understand?

1301
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,216
Where are we going?

1302
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:16,634
- Well, that's part of the bargain.
- Part of what bargain?

1303
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,771
That's my understanding. Now, I just
want to see it in this other place.

1304
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:24,524
And once I see it, that's it.
I'll give you Langford.

1305
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,650
- But you don't understand my position.
- Uh-huh.

1306
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,857
I have you right now.

1307
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,863
- That's true.
- If I have you, I have a shot at Langford.

1308
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:34,196
- But you don't have Jerry.
- I understand that.

1309
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,866
I'm getting it off
as fast as I can.

1310
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:40,953
- That's good, Masha.
- Yeah?

1311
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,161
- You all right?
- I'm doing fine.

1312
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:45,920
I know you are.

1313
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,582
Come on.

1314
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:58,221
One more thing, please. I can't walk
in here with you. If you could both...

1315
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:02,104
if you could just wait here and let
me walk in by myself, that's all.

1316
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:04,731
I'll break your ankles if
you make a wrong move.

1317
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,733
I promise. I promise, okay?

1318
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,441
But make believe you
don't know me too.

1319
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:11,695

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

1343
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:18,235
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which
was not at that time a federal offense.

1345
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:22,486
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1348
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:28,787
Now, I'd like to begin by saying
that my parents were too poor...

1349
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:31,874
to afford me a childhood
in Clifton...

1350
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:36,045
but the fact is that no one is allowed
to be really too poor in Clifton.

1351
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:39,552
Once you fall below a certain
level, they exile you to Passaic.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1353
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:48,562
But my parents did put the first
two down payments on my childhood.

1354
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,472
Don't get me wrong.

1355
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,391
But they did also return me
to the hospital as defective.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1357
01:36:56,978 --> 01:37:01,404
But like everyone else, I grew up
in large part thanks to my mother.

1358
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,910
If she were only
here today, I'd say:

1359
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,912
"Hey, Mom! What are you doing here?
You've been dead for nine years!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1361
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:14,796
But seriously, you should've seen
my mother. She was wonderful.

intelligent, alcoholic...

1366
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:29,306
Once they picked her up for speeding.
They clocked her doing 50.

1367
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:30,937

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING)

1369
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,655
And, you know, when
they tested her,

1370
01:37:39,681 --> 01:37:41,844
they found out that her
alcohol had 2 percent blood.

1371
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,985
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING)

1372
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:51,287
But we used to joke
together, Mom and me...

1373
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:56,455
until the tears would stroll down her
face and she would throw up! Yeah.

1374
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,249
And who would clean it up?
Ha, not Dad.

1375
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:04,171
He was too busy down at O'Grady's,
throwing up on his own. Yeah.

1376
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:08,433
In fact, until I was 16, I thought
throwing up was a sign of maturity.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1378
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:13,476
While the other kids were off in
the woods sneaking cigarettes...

1379
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,232
I was hiding behind the house
with my fingers down my throat.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING)

1381
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:28,287
The only problem was I never got anywhere,
until one day my father caught me.

1382
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:32,950
And, you know, just as he was giving me
a final kick in the stomach for luck...

1383
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:36,586
I managed to heave
all over his new shoes!

1384
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:40,465
"That's it!" I thought.
"I've made it! I'm finally a man!"

1385
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,627
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING)

1386
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,138
But, as it turned out,
I was wrong.

1387
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,179
That was the only attention
my father ever gave me.

1388
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:55,392
AUDIENCE: Aw...

1389
01:38:55,555 --> 01:39:00,652
Yeah, he was usually too busy out in the
park playing ball with my sister Rose.

AUDIENCE: Aw...

1391
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:05,531
But today, I must say, thanks to
those many hours of practice...

1392
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:08,409
my sister Rose has
grown into a fine man.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1394
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,702
Me, I wasn't interested
in athletics.

1395
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:20,839
The only exercise I ever got was
when the other kids picked on me.

1396
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:23,671
They used to beat me up once
a week, usually Tuesday.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1398
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:28,053
And after a while, the school
worked it into the curriculum.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1400
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:32,555
And if you knocked me out,
you got extra credit.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1402
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:38,056
Except there was this one kid.
Poor kid. He was afraid of me.

1403
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:41,601
I used to tell him, "Hit me, hit me!
What's the matter with you?

1404
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,440
Don't you wanna graduate?"

(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

1406
01:39:48,733 --> 01:39:50,799
As for me, hey, I was
the youngest kid

1407
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:53,685
in the history of the school
to graduate in traction.

(LAUGHING)

1409
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:02,289
But, you know, my only real interest, right
from the beginning, was show business.

1410
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:05,880
Even as a young man, I began at the

Now...

1413
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:16,428
a lot of you are probably wondering
why Jerry isn't with us tonight.

1414
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:19,097
Well, I'll tell you,
the fact is he's tied up.

1415
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,435
And I'm the one who tied him.

Go ahead and laugh. Thank you. I appreciate
it. But the fact is, I'm here.

1422

Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding
and you'll think I was crazy.

1423
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:55,308
But, look, I figure it this way: better to be
king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.

GERRITY: We're getting Langford now.

Rita, just because I made it big doesn't
mean I'm gonna forget about you.

Those jokes were murder.

- No. No.

that wrote the material.

I'd like to pick him
up and take him along.

1439
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:27,851
I wrote the material. I disagree with you.
I thought they were very good jokes.

1440
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:32,693
If you wrote that material,
I got one piece of advice for you.

1441

Throw yourself on your knees in front
of the judge and beg for mercy.
