1
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,163
Five...

2
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:27,540
nine, ten, eleven...

3
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:29,500
twelve, thirteen,
nineteen, seventeen...

4
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:31,502
- Arnie...
- fifteen, seventeen.
- Arnie, eat some chicken.

5
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:35,131
I don't...
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

6
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:39,177
You want some corn?

7
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,387
- I want... I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

8
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:45,975
Yeah, here.

9
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,689
- Good?

10
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,775
Not good corn.

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,031
- Gilbert?

12
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,616
Are they gonna come soon?

13
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,911
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

14
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:08,206
- Pretty soon.
- I want them to come.

15
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,710
- You wanna go home?
- No.

16
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:15,046
I wanna see 'em.

17
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,048
Okay.

18
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:20,134
They're gonna come soon, huh?

19
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,345
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

20
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,639
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?
- Yep.

21
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:26,683
Okay.

22
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:38,027
Gilbert! That's them, huh?
Gilbert, look, it's them!

23
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:41,531
Look! Look over there!

24
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:46,869
Over there!

25
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,751
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

26
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,925
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

27
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,512
- Arnie, get back here!
- Honk your horn!

28
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,931
- My brother Arnie's about to turn 18.
- Arnie!

29
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:09,350
- My family's planning
a big party for him.
- Arnie, come on!

30
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:14,022
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

31
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:18,067
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

32
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:24,824
God, Arnie. You're gettin' so big.
Pretty soon...

33
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:27,744
- I ain't gonna be able
to carry you no more.
- No.

34
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:30,663
- You know,
you're getting littler, Gilbert.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:33,583
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

36
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,879
You're shrinking, Gilbert.
You're shrinking.

37
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:40,423
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

38
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,976
Endora.

39
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,771
Endora's where we are.

40
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:57,273
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

41
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,445
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...

42
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,947
and nothing much ever will.

43
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:09,869
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.

44
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,789
And miles out of town on the interstate,
there's Foodland...

45
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,542
where everyone else shops.

46
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:21,547
This is where I live with my family.
My dad built the house...

47
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,633
and it's my job
to keep up the repairs.

48
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:30,473
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

49
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:33,184
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...

50
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:36,145
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."

51
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:50,660
Some days you want him to live...

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,705
some days you don't.

53
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,332
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

54
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,881
- I killed him, Gilbert.
- I know.
- I killed him.

55
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:06,718
I know, buddy.
I know.

56
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:14,100
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

57
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,439
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...

58
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:21,524
until it burned down last year.

59
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:26,112
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

60
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:30,867
She got her braces off,
and for days now she's been
walking around going, "Ooh. Ahh."

61
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,036
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

62
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,880
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

63
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:46,132
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...

64
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,635
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

65
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:51,721
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago...

66
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,598
Mama's had her hands full.

67
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:56,142
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

68
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,313
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

69
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,653
- I'm Gilbert.
- Amy, I need your help.
- What is it?

70
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:09,447
- Gilbert Grape.
- The garbage.

71
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:16,245
- "This is the stuff of the circus."
- Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?

72
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:18,289
I don't know, Mama.

73
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:21,084
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

74
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:27,423
Gilbert, get him down from there.

75
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:31,219
- Arnie?
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

76
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:36,265
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

77
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,395
- I thought he was with you.
- No. No.

78
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,148
- I wonder where he is.
- Gee, I don't know.

79
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:46,776
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

80
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,070
- He's in the tree.
- Ellen!

81
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:52,490
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

82
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,451
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

83
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,079
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:01,457
Whoa! Arnie.
Don't do that.

85
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,793
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

86
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:09,090
- Wait, wait. I was up there, Gilbert!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

87
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,301
I was right up there.

88
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:04,937
Can I help you with anything?

89
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,774
- No.
- Thank you, and goodbye.

90
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,322
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

91
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,158
- Is something goin' on at Foodland?
- Well, I wouldn't know, sir.

92
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,370
I don't shop there.
I'd rather die.

93
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:23,498
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

94
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,757
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

95
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,718
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

96
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,012
Am I right?

97
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,682
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

98
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:44,352
It's just a phase.
People will come back here, believe me.

99
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:47,730
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:53,111
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

101
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:02,662
- Can I have these two, Gilbert?
- No, just one.
- Come on.

102
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,664
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

103
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:06,582
Say "Thank you."

104
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,876
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All righty. See you tomorrow.

105
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:12,380
Gilbert? That was Mrs Carver
needing a delivery.

106
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:15,133
Could you?

107
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:21,139
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Hello.

108
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,810
- Boys, go on outside.
- But we don't want to.

109
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:29,605
- Yeah, we don't want to.
- Go play.

110
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,940
Okay.

111
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,528
Hey! Hey!

112
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:38,448
Arnie, get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

113
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:42,452
Okay. I was counting.

114
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:11,564
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

115
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:24,243
Hey, kids, let's play!
Come on! Look!

116
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:28,206
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

117
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,837
The, uh...
The ice cream's gonna melt...

118
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,465
soon.

119
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,887
You're right.
It is melting.

120
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,759
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

121
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,886
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my!

122
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,014
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

123
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,894
- Come on up here. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.
- I don't either.

124
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:35,982
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.

125
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:38,151
- You want a pool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we want a pool.

126
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:40,862
Come on. Come on up here.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

127
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,872
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

128
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,999
Oh. Oh.

129
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:59,297
Gilbert, come here for a second.

130
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:10,058
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Really, uh...

131
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:13,728
Oh, no. No, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

132
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:18,941
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

133
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,943
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Bye.

134
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,571
Gilbert?

135
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:27,784
Come by my office.
We need to talk.

136
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,080
Okay.

137
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:34,624
Arnie?

138
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:50,765
<i>Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.</i>

139
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:53,851
<i>- Arnie, get down!
- "Come on, son."
We've had enough fun for one day.</i>

140
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:57,146
- "Come on down."
- Hey!

141
00:11:57,271 --> 00:12:00,984
Hey! Hey!

142
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:03,319
Wanna go up there!

143
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:06,280
- "Son?"
- Yeah?

144
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,283
- "Come on down."
- No!

145
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,536
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

146
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:15,498
<i>Son, come on down.</i>

147
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,625
I'm gonna go up there!

148
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,964
- Arnie? Arnie. Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

149
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,882
Hi!

150
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,845
<i>Okay, son.
Come on down.</i>

151
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:32,348
I'm gonna go up here!

152
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:37,145
- "Come on, son."
- I'm goin' higher than before!

153
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:40,523
<i>- I'm goin' high!
- "It's gonna be getting dark soon."
Come on down.</i>

154
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:44,902
- Hey.
- Hey, Bob. Yeah, look it.
Here we go again.

155
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:48,031
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburettors...

156
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,158
and I can tell
without gettin' into it...

157
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:53,411
that that is a complicated unit.

158
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:57,665
l... Now, I understand. I can do it
myself, but I need the part.

159
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,584
Look, let me show you.

160
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,003
See, it's this
little guy right here.

161
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:04,297
See, the needle valve
is worn down.

162
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:08,676
- And I need a new one. Can we order it?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

163
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,513
- I can order it.
- I'm goin' up there!
- About how long
do you think that would take?

164
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,601
- Probably a week.
- A week?
- "Don't make us come get you."

165
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,687
l... You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

166
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,983
<i>Arnie?</i>

167
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:28,821
Whoa! I'm not gonna fall!
Whoops!

168
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,948
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

169
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,952
Hey!

170
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,080
My shoe done fell off.

171
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,834
My shoe done fell off, Gilbert.

172
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,006
<i>I know a boy
whose name is Arnie</i>

173
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:51,177
<i>He's about to turn 18
and have a big party</i>

174
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:53,888
<i>I know a boy
whose name is Arnie</i>

175
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,394
<i>Come on down, buddy.
Come on.</i>

176
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,987
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

177
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:14,534
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

178
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:20,665
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

179
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:23,710
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

180
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,004
<i>Boom, boom, boom, boom</i>

181
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:29,507
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

182
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,386
- Good boy.
- Easy does it, now.
- Come on down, buddy.

183
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:36,222
- All right!
- Come on down.

184
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,516
Come on!

185
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:50,945
Here we go. All right.
Thanks a lot, Jerry. Really sorry.

186
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,823
Good.
Good boy. Good boy.

187
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,659
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

188
00:14:56,743 --> 00:15:01,039
Son, we hear this every time.
Then after a couple of days,
he's right back up there again.

189
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:05,126
Yeah, but this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

190
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:08,546
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

191
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,215
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

192
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,301
Let's go.

193
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:19,265
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.
- Hey.

194
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,768
- Don't touch him.
- Whoa! Nice try!

195
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:25,855
- Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?
- Get out of here.

196
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,775
- Hey, could you help me out later...
- Yeah.
- with the fridge?

197
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:31,653
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

198
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,238
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

199
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:36,532
- All right. I have to get my tools.
- Hi.

200
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:40,536
I'll see you... I'll just come by later.
Hi. You be careful, all right, Arnie?

201
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,622
Okay.

202
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,837
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

203
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:53,341
Okay. I disappeared.

204
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:56,177
I disappeared on Mom like that.

205
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,888
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

206
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:01,724
- Gilbert, will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

207
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:04,352
- Good boy.
- Disappear like that.
- Good boy.

208
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,605
The food.

209
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,444
- Are we ready to talk about the party?
- Sure.
- I'm ready.

210
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:18,074
Ellen's in charge of decorations.
Get this... purple, orange and green.

211
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,867
- Sounds good.
- Theme colours, okay?

212
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:23,746
- That sounds pretty good.
- I'm doing the food, the cake.

213
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,498
Okay.

214
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:28,668
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

215
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,962
- And Mama,
you can supervise everything.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,923
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.
- Sounds good.

217
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:36,759
What about me?

218
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:39,012
You are the guest of honour.
How about that?

219
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:42,015
Gilbert, what about me?
My party! It's my party!

220
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:44,017
- What about me?
- You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.

221
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,103
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

222
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,522
All you have to do is turn 18.

223
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:52,358
- You know, that just leaves Gilbert.
- Huh?

224
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,028
You're the only one
without anything to do.

225
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,113
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

226
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:59,907
- No, I don't. No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

227
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:03,661
- I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.
- Ellen...

228
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:05,913
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

229
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:09,250
- Stop it, Ellen. Can it.
- Can I be excused?
- He never does anything!

230
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,587
- No!
- Please, can't we just do
something as a family?

231
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,006
- This is no fair, Mom! l...
- Can I please be excused?
- It's my party!

232
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,177
- We're planning this as a family.
- It's my party though!
- Is that too much to ask?

233
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,057
So it's gonna be an exact copy of the
one... the original they built in Boone.

234
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:26,601
- Really?
- Which is no big deal, Gilbert...

235
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:30,730
'cause they're all...
all Burger Barns are built identical.

236
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:32,815
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

237
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,151
I mean, it's so efficient.
It's amazing.

238
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:37,362
In a matter of a couple days...

239
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:39,489
there can be
a whole new restaurant there.

240
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:43,284
So I was driving past
the building site today.

241
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,330
- You know, it's goin' up right next to...
right down the road from Foodland.
- Right.

242
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,999
The general manager was there.
So I says...

243
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,669
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

244
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,797
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good. I mean...

245
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,634
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...

246
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:02,887
saltin' some fries.

247
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:06,057
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

248
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:11,020
- Hey! Get...
- What's the matter?

249
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,356
Get out of here! God!

250
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,984
I saw her!
I saw her, I saw her!

251
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,821
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

252
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,698
- You know what you did.
- Oh.

253
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,534
That's your mother in there.

254
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,703
- Your mother.
- I know.

255
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:31,457
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

256
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,043
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

257
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,504
Come on.

258
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,132
Run, now! Run!

259
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:45,513
- Hey! Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, you guys.

260
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:48,433
- Move, honey.
- Gilbert, you're shrinking.

261
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:51,519
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

262
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,870
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

263
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:11,873
Well, you gotta go to sleep, okay?

264
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:14,500
Okay. Goodbye.

265
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,337
No, it's not goodbye.
It's good night.

266
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,506
- Yeah.
- Goodbye...

267
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,885
is for when you're going away,
and we're not going anywhere, are we?

268
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:25,845
I know that.

269
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:28,056
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

270
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:32,185
We're not going anywhere!

271
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,312
- Goodbye!
- Arnie.

272
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,158
- You gotta work later?
- Hi, boys.
- Yeah, I do.

273
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:50,286
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi there, ladies.
- I gotta come back.

274
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,539
- How's Mama?
- She's fat.

275
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:57,627
- Come on, man.
She's not all that big, Gilbert.
- What?

276
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,131
Listen, I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

277
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:04,175
A little bit bigger?

278
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:07,679
- Look, all I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.
- Tucker, she's a whale.

279
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:09,764
- Well, take her out for walk
once in a while.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

280
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:13,810
- Take her out for a jog.
- Get her out of the house.
- Tucker, she's a whale!
- Hey, Bobby.

281
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,812
- Hey, Bobby.
- Give her a chance.

282
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,189
- That's all I'm sayin'.
- Hi, guys.
- I know.

283
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:21,609
- How's business?
- Not good. Hey!

284
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,736
Nobody's dying.

285
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,573
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

286
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:30,410
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.

287
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,704
That's a good thing for you to do...
to have that happen.

288
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:35,081
- If you guys would give it a chance...
- l-l...

289
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:38,501
I just was saying that
it wasn't something that
I should be doing for myself.

290
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:42,297
Look, they use canola oil, okay?
You know what canola oil is?
You probably don't.

291
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,173
- No.
- They probably don't even sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.

292
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:46,342
- No.
- It's cutting edge.

293
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:49,595
- It creates a crispier french fry and...
- Well, that's...

294
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,514
and a more unique product.

295
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:55,059
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
forget Burger King, forget McDonald's.

296
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:58,271
That's, like, old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

297
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,606
I mean, l-I could really
stand behind it. There's...

298
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,651
It's an innovative place. You know,
they created the salad bar...

299
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:07,613
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

300
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:09,907
- Yeah.
- They came up with that.

301
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:13,911
Fifteen different toppings
for each salad,
and two different kinds of lettuce.

302
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:16,414
And it's, you know,
it's all that you care to eat.

303
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:18,666
- I mean...
- Yeah.

304
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,795
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...

305
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,757
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...

306
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,383
to assistant manager.

307
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,429
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to, uh, manager...

308
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:34,641
and then regional manager
and then...

309
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:46,069
Look at the little fellas.

310
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:48,237
You mean my hoppers.

311
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:50,239
Let's try this.

312
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,325
For my friend.

313
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,330
There you go, my boy.

314
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:00,124
What do you say, Arnie?

315
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,252
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

316
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:10,009
Gilbert.

317
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,681
This Thursday.

318
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,769
It's our anniversary.

319
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:22,939
Okay.

320
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:27,568
Hello.

321
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:54,721
Gilbert.

322
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:56,723
I'll need a delivery later.

323
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:07,567
Have a nice day.

324
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,280
Gilbert?

325
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:14,615
Gilbert?

326
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,118
He's behind the chips.

327
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:22,081
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

328
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:25,501
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

329
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:28,463
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,508
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

331
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,552
I'll do it, Gilbert.
I'll do it.

332
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:42,268
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

333
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:48,566
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.
- I did it by myself.

334
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,195
Yeah. Look at that.

335
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:11,172
- I could go at any time.
- Shh. Arnie. No.

336
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:14,384
Any time.

337
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:16,928
Excuse me. Where to?

338
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:18,805
Oh, just keep going straight.

339
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:24,060
All right.

340
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:27,063
My mom... My mom wants me
to become... become 18.

341
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:30,525
And I'm having a big...
a big party, huh, Gilbert?

342
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:33,903
- Yep.
- When is that party coming?
- Six days.

343
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:37,865
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

344
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:41,411
- I'm 18, and you're not invited.
- Arnie.

345
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:44,497
- Don't be rude.
- Oh, it's okay.

346
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,708
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

347
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:59,178
- l-I got the groceries!
- All right. Be careful with them.

348
00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:01,848
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

349
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:05,435
- Oh.
- Uh-oh, Gilbert.
- No, Arnie.

350
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:07,937
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.

351
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:10,064
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

352
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:12,734
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, I'm really... I'm really sorry.

353
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:16,279
- This is...
- It's okay.

354
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:19,782
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

355
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:23,453
Are you sorry? No.

356
00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:25,955
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

357
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,249
Don't be sorry.

358
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,627
I'm not sorry.

359
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:38,635
So I think if we're gonna have
people come that early,
we should have some appetizers.

360
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:41,721
Ooh, yeah, that'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

361
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:44,974
And you put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

362
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,269
- Well, I was thinking...
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?

363
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:51,731
- You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers that they make with...
- No.

364
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:54,651
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can and you wrap them...

365
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:57,278
with little pieces of bacon
and you put a toothpick through 'em.

366
00:25:57,403 --> 00:26:01,074
- How do you cook the bacon?
- In the oven on a pan.

367
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:04,243
But the bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

368
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:06,579
- Yes, it will.
- And nobody wants greasy...

369
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:09,374
- I want hot dogs!
- No, you-you soak 'em...
- floppy bacon.

370
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:12,877
- Mama, I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

371
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:15,880
- Mama...
- I promise, we're gonna have hot dogs.
- What... I want hot dogs.

372
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:18,925
- The thing about...
- We're gonna have hot dogs.
- every party that I've been to...

373
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,885
- Ellen.
- is that...
- Ellen?
- What?

374
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:24,931
- Could you not talk
with your mouth full?
- Excuse me?

375
00:26:25,014 --> 00:26:27,684
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

376
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:32,313
- Oh. Okay, Dad.
- Ellen.

377
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:34,524
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

378
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:36,901
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

379
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:40,196
- Stop it, you guys.
- Don't start.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.

380
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,824
- Gilbert!
- Gilbert!
- I can't believe you said that!

381
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,868
- Shut up!
- Dad's dead!

382
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,704
- Arnie.
- Dad's dead!

383
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:50,832
- Arnie, shh. Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

384
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:54,836
- It's okay. Stop it now.
- Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

385
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,463
- Arnie, stop it!
- Calm down, Mama. Don't get upset.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

386
00:26:57,547 --> 00:27:00,258
- Make him stop.
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, shut up!

387
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:02,677
- Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!
- You're crazy... You're crazy, Arnie!

388
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,137
- Arnie...
- Stop it.
- Arnie...

389
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,015
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, listen to me!
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

390
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:10,518
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Just calm down!
- Stop it!

391
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:13,229
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dad's dead!
- That's enough!

392
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:15,440
- Arnie, that's enough!
- Stop it!
- Dad's dead!

393
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:18,526
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

394
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:21,362
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Right now!
- Dad's dead!

395
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:23,781
I said, stop it right now!

396
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:26,743
Amy. Amy.

397
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,870
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...

398
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:32,040
and the space
between 'em here is... should...

399
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:34,959
They're... Right now, it's at two feet,
and this should be 16 inches.

400
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:37,378
I mean, that's just standard.
And this right here...

401
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:41,299
See this here? Flat flooring?
I mean, flat flooring's like...

402
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:44,802
Once the wood gets old, you're
just gonna fall right through it.

403
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,804
Yeah, I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

404
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,893
Hey, Gilbert, why did... why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...

405
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:54,354
- Tucker!
- What?

406
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,690
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Sorry.

407
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,620
She's coming.
Hey, she's coming.

408
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,849
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah.

409
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,353
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thanks a lot for coming.

410
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:38,356
- Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood.
- Great.

411
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:41,067
Just... Let's keep it quiet.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

412
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,111
- What?
- Burger Barn. I'm in.

413
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,780
- I got the call.
- Oh, oh. Good.

414
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:49,158
It's not too late, you know.
Good night.

415
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,332
<i>- I think she's asleep.
- "Let's say that you wanna"
slice down zucchini squash...</i>

416
00:28:56,457 --> 00:28:59,627
<i>with the electric food dehydrator.
Look at this.</i>

417
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:03,006
<i>- Wonderful.
- Perfect slices each and every time.</i>

418
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,465
<i>- Is that nice?
- Marvellous.</i>

419
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,093
<i>Of course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...</i>

420
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:08,970
<i>- Okay.
- Taking corn off the cob.</i>

421
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:11,389
<i>Look at this. We'll just turn
the dial down a little bit...</i>

422
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:20,064
<i>... freezed corn, and sit there
for hours with a knife.</i>

423
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:22,984
<i>- Literally hours cutting your corn up.
- Unbelievable.</i>

424
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:25,069
<i>Of course, for un...</i>

425
00:29:27,822 --> 00:29:31,242
- "Right now, you get the..."
- Gilbert, what are you doing?

426
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:33,661
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

427
00:29:33,745 --> 00:29:35,747
Jeez.

428
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:41,586
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm?

429
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:43,671
I made up that bed for you.

430
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:48,176
What for?

431
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,303
Well, just in case
you wanted a change.

432
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:54,265
I'm happy right where I am.

433
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:57,727
- You sure?
- Yeah.

434
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:13,076
Here you go.

435
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:18,915
Here you go, Mama.

436
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,541
Thanks, kids.

437
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,627
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

438
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,972
- Another ball!
- I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.

439
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,974
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

440
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:37,725
What's she doing here?

441
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,769
She... I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

442
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:41,980
- I think their car broke down
or something.
- Another ball!

443
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:44,273
Come on. You... I can see it
in your face that you're...

444
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,694
- Can we just not talk about this now?
Can we just change the subject?
- Why not?

445
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:52,031
- Do you understand?
- We want a pool.

446
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:58,997
- Okay. You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

447
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,916
- Look at those guys out there.
- Gilbert.

448
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,420
They're laughing, they're all happy...

449
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:07,839
and waving to their friends.

450
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:11,509
But the next day... and this is
the thing that they don't know...

451
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:15,346
they could be lying on the slab.

452
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,807
It's kind of, uh, harsh.

453
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,477
But it's kind of fun too.

454
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:28,693
- Do you ever, um...
- What?

455
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,282
Well, you know.

456
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:37,368
- Thank you.
- Are you tempted to, like...

457
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,997
wanna fool around with the bodies?

458
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,334
- Oh, Tucker, come on.
- No, I wanted to ask.
I've always wanted to ask.

459
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,169
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.
- No, no.

460
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:49,714
- People are very curious about that.
- Because, I mean
if you don't wanna talk about it...

461
00:31:49,797 --> 00:31:53,301
The worst thing that we do is we take
the bodies... the grotesque ones...

462
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:56,095
the really, really ugly ones...

463
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,724
and we make... make jokes about them,
you know, harmless jokes.

464
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:02,560
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with some...

465
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:07,857
- Come on.
- some very good... good jokes
about them, my father and me.

466
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:11,861
But-But, you know, they're dead.
And, uh...

467
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,656
- You know, nobody can see that.
Nobody hears anything.
- Hi, boys.

468
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:17,325
- Hi, Mrs Carver.
- Hello, Mrs Carver.
- Hi.

469
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,161
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

470
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:23,081
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

471
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:26,334
Mr Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

472
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:28,503
- How's she doing?
- Fine. She's fine.

473
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:32,090
Thanks. Bye.

474
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,384
He wants...
He wants to kill you, right?

475
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:37,428
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

476
00:32:57,907 --> 00:33:00,159
Hey! Gilbert!

477
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:03,079
Hey, can somebody give me
a hand down here?

478
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:05,707
- What?
- Can somebody give me a hand
with the wood?

479
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:11,629
- Hey, Arnie.
- Huh?

480
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:15,633
- You wanna go help Tucker?
- Uh-uh.

481
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:18,303
Arnie, go help Tucker in the basement.

482
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:25,601
Arnie, why don't you
go into the basement?

483
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:28,521
- I don't wanna go down there, Gilbert.
- Please?

484
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:32,358
No way! No way! No way!
You!

485
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:36,362
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

486
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:39,282
Gilbert? Hey!

487
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,909
Dad's in there!

488
00:33:45,622 --> 00:33:48,583
Dad's in there!

489
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:51,002
Arnie, shut up!
Arnie!

490
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:58,676
Shut up! Shut up!

491
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:06,517
Come on! Arnie.

492
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:13,191
Arnie!

493
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,151
It's not funny!

494
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:17,236
Get back here!

495
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,701
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

496
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:27,664
You know, there's six of'em,
so, you know, those could hold anybody.

497
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:38,341
- l-I forgot.
- What?

498
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:43,888
I forgot that
that was where your dad...

499
00:34:47,392 --> 00:34:49,811
Yep.

500
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:51,896
I'm-I'm sorry.

501
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:56,025
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

502
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:06,202
- No, Arnie! No! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

503
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,663
Arnie! No, you're not!

504
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:11,541
Arnie! Not again!

505
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:14,168
- Arnie!
- I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.

506
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:16,254
Get down!

507
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:22,135
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

508
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:24,387
I wanna go up there!

509
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:30,435
No! We're going home!

510
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:34,731
We're going home.
Come on.

511
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:36,816
- Stop!
- Ellen, no! Stop it!

512
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:39,068
- Stop it!
- I told you, don't touch him.

513
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:41,154
- What am I supposed to do?
- Don't ever touch him again.
- He was climbing again!

514
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:44,741
I don't care. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!

515
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:47,452
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

516
00:35:47,535 --> 00:35:50,955
Let me see. Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

517
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,752
What does Gilbert say?

518
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:58,254
If anybody ever hits you...

519
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:01,382
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

520
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:03,801
Arnie?

521
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:05,887
Hmm?

522
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,932
You're gonna tell me, and then I'm
gonna take care of it for you, right?

523
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:12,685
And why will I take care of it?

524
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,646
- Gilbert.
- Hmm?

525
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:17,273
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

526
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:19,651
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?

527
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:24,822
Okay. You wanna pick out some candy?

528
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:33,289
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

529
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:36,042
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

530
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:39,003
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

531
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:41,089
Are you listening to me?

532
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,595
- Mine.
- And you.

533
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,597
- Huh?
- You have to stay here.

534
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:53,476
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

535
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,021
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

536
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:01,901
We're not going anywhere, Gilbert.
We're not going anywhere, you know?

537
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:06,239
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.

538
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:08,533
We're not going...
We're not going anywhere.

539
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:13,830
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere!

540
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,873
Gilbert, we're not going anywhere.

541
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:20,878
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere.

542
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:24,007
Where are you going?

543
00:38:27,362 --> 00:38:29,155
Hey!

544
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:32,533
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

545
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:35,411
Hey!

546
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,582
Hi, Gilbert.

547
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:49,759
- Oh, look. Come here.
- What?

548
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:52,595
- It's a praying mantis.
- Oh.

549
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,599
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...

550
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:58,726
and she'll bite off his head...

551
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,229
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

552
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:03,481
And then when they're done...

553
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,608
she'll eat him.

554
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:07,694
She'll eat the rest of him.

555
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:13,199
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

556
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:18,413
- Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you. Wow.

557
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,461
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

558
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,633
If we get on the road by Friday,
we'll be able to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.

559
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:34,012
Have you ever been to Colorado?

560
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:35,930
No, ma'am.

561
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:37,932
It must be wonderful.

562
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,976
It must be incredibly
frustrating then...

563
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:42,603
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.

564
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,440
This place
is as good a place as any.

565
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:47,817
Think so?

566
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,111
She should know.

567
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:52,864
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

568
00:39:52,947 --> 00:39:54,866
Places I didn't even know existed.

569
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:58,161
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

570
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:05,209
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

571
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:06,878
Why doesn't matter.

572
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:10,506
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

573
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,759
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

574
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:19,265
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

575
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,309
Isn't she?
Isn't she beautiful?

576
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:23,978
Isn't she beautiful?

577
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:30,485
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...

578
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,987
Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

579
00:40:33,112 --> 00:40:37,408
I'm not into that... that whole
external beauty thing, you know.

580
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:40,828
- 'Cause it... it doesn't last.
- Right.

581
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:44,415
You're, you know... Eventually,
your face is gonna get wrinkly...

582
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:48,086
- you'll get grey hair...
- Sure.
- your boobs might sag.

583
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:50,463
You know? So what?

584
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:53,549
It's what you do
that really matters.

585
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:56,177
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

586
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,304
So what do you wanna do?

587
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:02,934
Oh, uh, I don't know. I mean,
there's not so much to do here, really.

588
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:09,482
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing that people do here.

589
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,695
Um...

590
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,863
Thank you.

591
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:17,949
It was nice meeting you.

592
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,202
Be nice.

593
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:28,251
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

594
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:39,470
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

595
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,099
No, we want the big one!

596
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:45,768
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

597
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:50,231
- No, we want the big one!
- Yeah, I like it.

598
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:52,358
- Let's go.
- Come on! Get us the big one!

599
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:55,570
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.
- l...

600
00:41:55,653 --> 00:41:58,031
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

601
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:04,329
It's changing.
That's what's wild about the sunset.

602
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:09,125
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

603
00:42:15,214 --> 00:42:18,051
I love the sky.

604
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:21,679
It's so limitless.

605
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,642
It is big.
It's very big.

606
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,602
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

607
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:30,104
That-That word "big" is so small.

608
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:33,066
You'd have to get
those really giant words...

609
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:35,568
to describe the sky.

610
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,073
Oh. Um...

611
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:42,367
What?

612
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:47,288
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

613
00:42:47,455 --> 00:42:50,541
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

614
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:53,461
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

615
00:42:57,924 --> 00:43:01,010
I could come back. I mean, I can...
I can come back and...

616
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:03,596
- Really?
- Yeah. Will you... You'll be here then?

617
00:43:03,721 --> 00:43:05,807
- Yeah.
- All right.
- I'll just sit here.

618
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,684
All right, I'll be...
I'll be back in a little bit.

619
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:10,228
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:15,191
- Gilbert.
- Hey, buddy. Come on. We gotta go.

621
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:17,276
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

622
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:22,407
- Gilbert, where's the duck?
- Where's the duck?
- I can't see the duck anywhere.

623
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,785
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

624
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:29,330
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- Arnie, I don't have time for this.

625
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:31,708
Lift up. Okay, good.

626
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,877
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

627
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:37,422
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

628
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:40,174
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.
- Hey, you know what?

629
00:43:40,258 --> 00:43:42,885
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.

630
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:46,764
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

631
00:43:46,848 --> 00:43:48,725
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

632
00:43:48,808 --> 00:43:51,978
- Okay, take this.
- Take this.
- Wash everything.

633
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,939
- Your towels are there...
- Okay.
- and your robe is there.

634
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,190
- Okay.
- Okay?

635
00:43:56,274 --> 00:43:59,777
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right. Okay.

636
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:01,988
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
- Gotta go.

637
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:07,368
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

638
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:09,746
- The sunset.
- Really?

639
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:12,373
- It was beautiful.
- Oh.

640
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:14,459
Oh, well.

641
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,923
I'd like to see where you live.

642
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:24,969
- No, you wouldn't.
- Let's go see where you live.

643
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,013
Come on.

644
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:35,897
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

645
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:39,901
I go back and forth between them...

646
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:42,904
'cause they're always moving.

647
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:46,157
But it's good.
It's my life.

648
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:49,953
Yeah.

649
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:52,121
We don't really move.

650
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:54,207
I mean, we'd like to, but...

651
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:58,628
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

652
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:02,507
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

653
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,968
She's pretty much wedged in.

654
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:09,681
- What do you mean?
- That's it. That's the house.

655
00:45:12,558 --> 00:45:14,644
It's really amazing.

656
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:17,814
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...

657
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:21,776
the girth of what's inside of it.

658
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:29,409
I don't know.

659
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:32,912
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?

660
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,956
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

661
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,001
That's her.
That's my mom.

662
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:46,092
What about your dad?

663
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:49,470
Some other day.
Some other day.

664
00:46:02,984 --> 00:46:05,528
I had a nice time tonight.

665
00:46:07,322 --> 00:46:09,574
I know.

666
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:14,704
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,710
Oh, no. Oh, no.

668
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:05,880
Oh, Arnie. Come on.
I'm sorry, buddy. Come on.

669
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:12,303
Here, here.
You're okay. You're okay.

670
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:15,223
You're okay.
You're okay, buddy.

671
00:47:15,348 --> 00:47:17,058
Come on. Get warm.

672
00:47:17,141 --> 00:47:20,603
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

673
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:23,648
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:26,275
Would somebody please explain?

675
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:30,947
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.
- I could have "drownded."

676
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,324
I could have "drownded."

677
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:35,827
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

678
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:41,207
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths, Mama.

679
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,627
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

680
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:47,755
- No.
- It's ready.

681
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,341
Where's your head lately, Gilbert?

682
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:54,345
Where is your head?
Gilbert?

683
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:57,890
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

684
00:47:58,057 --> 00:48:02,228
- You gotta do better.
- Gotta do better.

685
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:07,191
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

686
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,486
That's right.

687
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:14,240
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

688
00:48:14,365 --> 00:48:17,660
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

689
00:48:17,744 --> 00:48:19,746
Here.

690
00:48:21,831 --> 00:48:23,833
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

691
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,918
It sounds urgent.

692
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,973
Uh, get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

693
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:41,851
- But...
- Right now. Hurry up.

694
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,487
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

695
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:57,241
Gilbert, could you dial that number
over there for me?

696
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,870
- My hands are all...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

697
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:03,373
- How have you been?
- Good.

698
00:49:03,456 --> 00:49:06,376
I saw you last night.

699
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:09,087
Who's the girl?

700
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,632
- It's ringing.
- I got... Sorry. One sec.

701
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:16,928
This is good. Taste.

702
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:18,888
That's good. It's, uh, ringing.

703
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:20,807
One second.

704
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:25,103
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

705
00:49:25,186 --> 00:49:30,191
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

706
00:49:30,274 --> 00:49:33,111
- Mr Carver?
- "Who is this?"

707
00:49:33,194 --> 00:49:37,532
- Uh, it's Gilbert.
- Gilbert!

708
00:49:37,615 --> 00:49:40,618
- "I'd given up on you, Gilbert."
- Did you?

709
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:43,496
- "Well, yeah. Can you blame me?"
- No, no.

710
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:47,542
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

711
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:50,128
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

712
00:49:50,211 --> 00:49:52,463
<i>Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...</i>

713
00:49:52,547 --> 00:49:55,383
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

714
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:57,802
- Yes.
- "Today is your lucky day."

715
00:49:57,885 --> 00:50:01,139
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

716
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:07,020
Is that a yes, Gilbert?

717
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,522
- "Huh?"
- Okay.
- "All right."

718
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,524
I'm gonna be waiting
here for you, Gilbert.

719
00:50:11,607 --> 00:50:14,527
Bye.

720
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,488
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

721
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,783
Just playing.
Don't-Don't you wanna play?

722
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:23,911
This is crazy.
I, uh... I've gotta go.

723
00:50:23,995 --> 00:50:26,456
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

724
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:29,917
Hey!

725
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:32,545
It's that new girl, isn't it?

726
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,340
No, it's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

727
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:39,510
If you walk out that door...

728
00:50:39,594 --> 00:50:41,929
Don't you dare walk out that door.

729
00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:09,832
You look nervous, Gilbert.

730
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,960
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

731
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:16,381
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

732
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:20,802
I reviewed your file.

733
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:23,054
You've got
no major medical insurance.

734
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:26,933
No catastrophic, no life.

735
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:31,312
Gilbert...

736
00:51:31,396 --> 00:51:35,108
what if something
were to happen to you?

737
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:37,735
Something unforeseeable?

738
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:40,405
Something sudden? Random?

739
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:45,451
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

740
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,789
Do you ever think about your family?

741
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,210
Now, stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

742
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:59,590
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

743
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:02,218
Ken Carver here.

744
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:04,304
Look, can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

745
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:10,727
Oh. Betty, please, calm down.
Calm down.

746
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:14,230
No, no. l-l...
No, go on.

747
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:16,316
Go on, go on.

748
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:20,612
No. No.

749
00:52:29,787 --> 00:52:31,748
No, no. Calm...

750
00:52:31,873 --> 00:52:33,833
I'll... I'm on my way.

751
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:41,758
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

752
00:52:42,884 --> 00:52:45,428
Oh, damn.
Betty's got the car.

753
00:52:45,511 --> 00:52:48,514
Gilbert, would you give me a ride?

754
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:11,537
Oh, my God! Betty!

755
00:53:11,663 --> 00:53:13,790
What the hell's going on here?

756
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:16,834
Todd? Doug?
Betty, what is going on here?

757
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:20,254
I don't believe this!

758
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:24,550
Oh, great!
Oh, God!

759
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,219
Boys, come on.
Let's...

760
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:29,222
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

761
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,933
This is great.

762
00:53:34,435 --> 00:53:36,437
All right.
Everything's okay.

763
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:39,357
These aren't burned.

764
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,902
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

765
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,738
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

766
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,700
They're wonderful.

767
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:51,661
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

768
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:53,538
They're really good. Here.

769
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:55,790
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

770
00:53:55,873 --> 00:53:59,168
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies. Please. Please.

771
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:02,046
- Hey.
- Go on!

772
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,466
- What are you doing?
- I could've had any guy. Any guy!
- You want a real pool?

773
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,594
- What do you think this is?
- But...
- Doug, come over here!

774
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,306
- What?
- I chose you.
- It is a pool, son!

775
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:14,475
- I chose you.
- I got you a real pool, for God's sake!

776
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,853
Look! There's water in here!

777
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:19,480
Come here! Come here!
Get over here!

778
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:22,525
Come here!
Get inside the pool!

779
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:25,528
Get inside the pool with your brother!
Come here!

780
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:28,114
- Why did you?
- Get inside the pool!

781
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,950
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.

782
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,578
Okay, so I don't...

783
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:36,581
- Because...
- I give you all I have,
for Christ's sake!

784
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:39,334
- I knew you'd always be there.
- I've given you everything!
- Because...

785
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:43,963
- Here's a pool!
- Because I knew you'd never leave.
- A trampoline!

786
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,633
What the hell else more do you want?

787
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,427
What? For God's sake!

788
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:55,266
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!

789
00:54:56,976 --> 00:54:59,896
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

790
00:54:59,979 --> 00:55:03,900
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!

791
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:07,236
I can't give any more!
I've given enough already!

792
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:10,490
I can't give any more!
I've given enough already!

793
00:55:19,835 --> 00:55:22,046
l- l-I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.

794
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:25,174
Not yet.

795
00:55:25,257 --> 00:55:28,177
- "Arthur, in all my life..."
- Move, Amy.

796
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,305
I wondered, where is he?

797
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:36,519
Just this moment, just now.

798
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:42,191
What is he looking at?
What is he thinking?

799
00:55:42,274 --> 00:55:44,735
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

800
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:47,655
No!

801
00:55:47,738 --> 00:55:50,866
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

802
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,202
Just let him stink.

803
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:56,414
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.
- No!

804
00:55:56,497 --> 00:55:59,208
You know Mr Carver?

805
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:02,336
Well, he's dead.

806
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:07,091
He's dead.

807
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:21,397
Okay, kids, hurry up.
Let's go.

808
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:27,236
- Hi.
- Hey.

809
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:32,158
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

810
00:56:34,243 --> 00:56:36,495
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

811
00:56:39,665 --> 00:56:43,336
- A kiddie pool. I don't get it.
- Wow.

812
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:45,254
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

813
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:48,633
- Oh, yeah.
- He-He "drownded."
- Shh, shh, shh.

814
00:56:48,716 --> 00:56:51,135
Shh, shh, shh. Come on.

815
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:53,971
All right?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

816
00:56:57,558 --> 00:57:00,603
He had the cardiac arrest.

817
00:57:00,686 --> 00:57:04,315
His head bent forward,
his knees buckled...

818
00:57:04,398 --> 00:57:06,817
and then he just fell...

819
00:57:08,444 --> 00:57:10,154
face forward into the pool.

820
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:12,698
When she found him,
he was already dead.

821
00:57:12,782 --> 00:57:14,951
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

822
00:57:15,117 --> 00:57:18,913
No, I know it. I would...
I saw the... I saw the... I saw the body.

823
00:57:18,996 --> 00:57:21,791
- I saw the... I prepared it.
I know exactly what...
- You don't know...

824
00:57:21,874 --> 00:57:24,001
I would have seen...
I would have seen what...

825
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:26,671
if there was any kind of struggle
that had gone on.

826
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:29,548
- It was murder.
- No.

827
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:31,676
What do you think?
What do you think?

828
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:35,846
I, uh, I don't know.
I, um... You know, it's-it's possible.

829
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,433
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

830
00:57:39,558 --> 00:57:42,395
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...
- Even if she did wanna do it...

831
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:45,272
- She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.
- Even if she did...

832
00:57:45,356 --> 00:57:47,358
If-lf you saw somebody laying...

833
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:50,486
with their head down
in the pool motionless...

834
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:53,656
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...

835
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:56,284
- which he wasn't doing,
but even if that...
- You don't know that!

836
00:57:56,367 --> 00:58:00,162
Well, it-it was an extreme,
uh, "post-cardial" infarction.

837
00:58:00,246 --> 00:58:03,291
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?
- N-No.

838
00:58:03,374 --> 00:58:06,335
Hey, Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

839
00:58:06,419 --> 00:58:08,713
- Gilbert, it's that girl!
- It's perfectly logical.

840
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,424
Even if it's...
Listen. Wait a minute, Tucker.

841
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:13,968
We're not talkin' about...
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.

842
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:19,056
- We're talkin' about pushin' along
something that's rolling that direction.
- Hi!

843
00:58:19,223 --> 00:58:21,642
- Please, play with me over there.
- Okay.
- Please?

844
00:58:21,726 --> 00:58:23,936
Come on. Let's play over there.
Come on. Please play...

845
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,563
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.

846
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:27,982
- Will you play over there?
Will you play?
- Okay. Okay, we'll play.

847
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:30,735
- Settle down.
- We're gonna play!
- Okay, okay.

848
00:58:30,818 --> 00:58:33,696
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah, yeah.

849
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:41,370
So, that's it.

850
00:58:41,495 --> 00:58:44,290
Yeah, I guess so.

851
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:49,128
The magic part.

852
00:58:53,966 --> 00:58:57,178
The magic part?

853
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:59,597
The magic part, Gilbert?

854
00:59:05,603 --> 00:59:07,980
- Hey, could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.
- Yeah?

855
00:59:08,147 --> 00:59:11,609
- Oh, thanks.
- Can we go play now?

856
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:13,819
- What are we gonna play?
- Hi.
- Hi.

857
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:16,530
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?
Hide-and-go-seek?

858
00:59:16,614 --> 00:59:18,282
- You like that?
- Gilbert?
- Mm-hmm?

859
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:20,409
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

860
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,294
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

861
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,340
Try it.

862
00:59:43,182 --> 00:59:45,685
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know.

863
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,313
I don't...
It's a mystery.

864
00:59:49,397 --> 00:59:52,316
- Gilbert, listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

865
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,237
Come play with me in the water.

866
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,740
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

867
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:02,285
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

868
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:04,537
No, I want you to come in with me.

869
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,414
No.

870
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:08,666
Say "Where's Arnie?"

871
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:10,293
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

872
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:12,670
Where's Arnie?

873
01:00:12,753 --> 01:00:17,216
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

874
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:20,678
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

875
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:23,931
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

876
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:26,600
Don't even try it, 'cause he's...
he's had a scare with water...

877
01:00:26,684 --> 01:00:28,978
and he won't...
he won't come in.

878
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:31,355
I'm not comin' in the water.

879
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,777
- You wanna come in the water?
- No.

880
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:38,863
Why not?

881
01:00:41,157 --> 01:00:43,326
Are you scared
to come in the water?

882
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:46,162
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

883
01:00:46,245 --> 01:00:49,749
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

884
01:00:49,874 --> 01:00:52,627
Are you scared, Gilbert?

885
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:56,130
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

886
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:59,342
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

887
01:00:59,425 --> 01:01:01,552
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

888
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:07,642
A little more.

889
01:01:08,893 --> 01:01:10,895
Do you wanna see this?

890
01:01:12,396 --> 01:01:15,232
You want this, right?
Huh? You happy?

891
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:25,993
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

892
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:29,538
- Okay?
- Okay.

893
01:01:29,664 --> 01:01:31,582
Okay, what do you want?

894
01:01:32,959 --> 01:01:35,252
- Faster!
- Okay.

895
01:01:35,336 --> 01:01:37,338
I want a new thing.

896
01:01:39,131 --> 01:01:42,301
House. I want a new house
for the family.

897
01:01:45,554 --> 01:01:47,890
I want a...
I want Mama...

898
01:01:48,015 --> 01:01:50,142
to take aerobics classes.

899
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:53,938
I want Ellen to grow up.

900
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:57,400
I want a new brain for Arnie.

901
01:01:57,483 --> 01:02:00,069
I want...

902
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:02,905
What do you want for you?

903
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:06,033
Just for you.

904
01:02:06,117 --> 01:02:08,286
I want to be a good person.

905
01:02:12,665 --> 01:02:14,917
I can't... I can't do this.
I can't...

906
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:18,170
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

907
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:23,259
Arnie?

908
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,558
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

909
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:32,685
No.

910
01:02:47,617 --> 01:02:49,243
Shit.

911
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,301
- Hey!
- Come on.

912
01:03:05,426 --> 01:03:07,887
Hey! Over here!

913
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:11,390
- Hang on, son.
- Come on, now.

914
01:03:11,515 --> 01:03:14,435
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

915
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,146
All right, here we go.
There you go.

916
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:19,315
It's all right, Jerry. I got him.
I got him. It's all right, Jerry.

917
01:03:19,398 --> 01:03:21,817
We're takin' him in.

918
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:23,861
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise this time.

919
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:25,905
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...

920
01:03:25,988 --> 01:03:27,823
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

921
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:31,535
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights!
Play the siren, okay?

922
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:33,663
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

923
01:03:33,788 --> 01:03:35,748
Way to go, Gilbert.

924
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,628
- Jerry, listen. You're gonna... You're
gonna have to take it easy on him.
- We'll take care of him, Gilbert.

925
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:44,340
- You gotta... Really,
you gotta keep an eye on him.
- All right. All right.

926
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:46,634
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

927
01:03:46,717 --> 01:03:50,763
Do the siren. Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

928
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:04,527
I know, Sheriff.

929
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,366
I know that, Sheriff.

930
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:13,411
Okay. Asshole!

931
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,457
They're probably just teaching him
a lesson. They're probably just
proving a point.

932
01:04:18,582 --> 01:04:20,543
Yeah. That's right.

933
01:04:23,796 --> 01:04:26,841
Get my coat.

934
01:04:26,924 --> 01:04:29,635
What?

935
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:32,346
Get my coat.

936
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:35,891
Get it!

937
01:04:46,944 --> 01:04:49,196
Let's go.

938
01:05:01,042 --> 01:05:04,378
Well, at least he's in a safe place.
At least someone's watching him.

939
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:06,422
Ellen, shut up.

940
01:05:20,645 --> 01:05:23,022
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

941
01:05:23,105 --> 01:05:25,566
Mama. Mama,
let Gilbert handle this.

942
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:37,244
- Jerry, come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

943
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:40,247
- Please, you gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

944
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,752
- I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be...
- Look.

945
01:05:44,835 --> 01:05:48,881
No one's going to do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

946
01:05:48,965 --> 01:05:50,758
Jerry!

947
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:55,304
Jerry!

948
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:01,519
Jerry!

949
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:13,239
Jerry, I've come for my son.

950
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:17,785
<i>Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?</i>

951
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,079
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

952
01:06:20,162 --> 01:06:22,373
No! No!

953
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:25,001
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

954
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:29,588
- But Bonnie, you have to calm...
- My son! Give me my son!

955
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:43,102
Come on. You're goin' home.

956
01:06:45,563 --> 01:06:48,941
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

957
01:06:50,151 --> 01:06:53,112
- Don't disappear like that any more.
- Okay.

958
01:06:53,195 --> 01:06:56,657
- Promise me.
- Mom!

959
01:06:56,741 --> 01:06:59,410
You're free, baby. You're free.
Let's go home.

960
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:08,377
Hi!

961
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:10,463
Look!

962
01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:25,019
That's why she needs a cane.

963
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,172
Look at her!

964
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:16,862
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

965
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:21,659
Flash the lights.

966
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,792
Hey!

967
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,253
Look at me!

968
01:08:32,336 --> 01:08:36,173
I'm hiding!
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"

969
01:08:36,257 --> 01:08:38,551
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

970
01:08:42,888 --> 01:08:44,890
Gilbert, come find me.

971
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,311
Where's Arnie?

972
01:08:50,605 --> 01:08:52,815
Hey.

973
01:08:52,898 --> 01:08:55,109
That's my mom in there.

974
01:08:55,192 --> 01:08:57,528
My mama.

975
01:08:57,695 --> 01:09:00,531
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

976
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:02,867
Come play with me.

977
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:21,677
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

978
01:09:23,054 --> 01:09:25,765
You know that, right?

979
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:29,685
I'd like to meet her.

980
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:31,771
No, you wouldn't.

981
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:37,443
Hey, where do you go next?

982
01:10:15,273 --> 01:10:17,692
I would like to meet your mom.

983
01:10:25,658 --> 01:10:30,454
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

984
01:10:30,538 --> 01:10:33,791
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...

985
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:38,004
and we commit his body
to the ground.

986
01:10:38,087 --> 01:10:41,173
Earth to earth...

987
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:44,802
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

988
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,556
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

989
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:51,392
The Lord make his face
shine on him...

990
01:10:51,475 --> 01:10:53,519
and be gracious to him.

991
01:10:53,644 --> 01:10:56,564
The Lord look upon him
with favour...

992
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:59,734
and give him peace.

993
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,572
Lord Jesus, by your death
you took away the sting of death.

994
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,658
Grant to us, your servants,
so to follow in faith...

995
01:11:07,742 --> 01:11:10,286
- for you have led the way...
- Hey! Hey!

996
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:13,039
- that we may at length
fall asleep peacefully in you...
- Lookit here!

997
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,915
- Lookit here!
- great in your likeness...

998
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:20,796
- Look where I'm pointing!
- the God of peace who brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.

999
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,133
The great shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of
the everlasting covenant...

1000
01:11:24,216 --> 01:11:28,512
- It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!
- make you perfect in
every good work to do his will...

1001
01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:32,725
- Gilbert, it's a Burger Barn!
- working in you that which is
well pleasing in his sight...

1002
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:36,270
- Burger Barn!
- through Jesus Christ, amen.

1003
01:11:41,692 --> 01:11:45,821
- Hey.
- Boys, you can have anything you want.

1004
01:11:45,905 --> 01:11:50,242
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want too.

1005
01:11:50,326 --> 01:11:52,954
As for me,
something with menthol, please.

1006
01:11:53,037 --> 01:11:55,665
You like gum?
Do you like gum?

1007
01:11:55,748 --> 01:11:58,250
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

1008
01:11:58,334 --> 01:12:01,837
- Here, take this.
You can have it. Take it.
- Hey.

1009
01:12:04,382 --> 01:12:08,135
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St Louis.

1010
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:10,429
I can't stay in that house.

1011
01:12:13,224 --> 01:12:15,601
I really am sorry about your...

1012
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:21,148
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

1013
01:12:25,736 --> 01:12:27,655
Everybody thinks I killed him.

1014
01:12:30,574 --> 01:12:33,494
Do you?

1015
01:12:33,577 --> 01:12:35,913
No.

1016
01:12:43,462 --> 01:12:46,090
I miss him...

1017
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:50,886
and I don't.

1018
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,848
I miss him, and I don't.

1019
01:13:07,987 --> 01:13:12,450
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?

1020
01:13:14,118 --> 01:13:16,954
Oh, I'll probably just...

1021
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:20,207
You haven't thought about it.

1022
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:24,211
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

1023
01:13:24,295 --> 01:13:27,840
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

1024
01:13:27,923 --> 01:13:30,468
- Mommy?
- Mommy is coming in a minute, honey.

1025
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,553
Okay.

1026
01:13:36,515 --> 01:13:38,476
Concerning my boys?

1027
01:13:38,601 --> 01:13:43,272
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

1028
01:13:46,692 --> 01:13:48,361
Hi.

1029
01:13:58,913 --> 01:14:01,415
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice...

1030
01:14:01,499 --> 01:14:03,834
for my boys to be like you.

1031
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:23,104
He's all yours.

1032
01:14:34,532 --> 01:14:36,284
Are you gonna miss her?

1033
01:14:38,828 --> 01:14:40,746
Yeah.

1034
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,253
Good.

1035
01:15:47,855 --> 01:15:49,982
Damn it!

1036
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:18,511
So, what do you think?

1037
01:16:20,846 --> 01:16:23,057
- Wow.
- Right?
- Wow.

1038
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,102
Right?
Here, try a milkshake.

1039
01:16:30,815 --> 01:16:32,817
Real milk in there.

1040
01:16:32,942 --> 01:16:35,569
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

1041
01:16:41,117 --> 01:16:44,870
Bob... Oh, Bob.

1042
01:16:44,996 --> 01:16:48,082
- Hey! Congratulations!
This looks great!
- Thanks, Bob.

1043
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:50,459
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks a million.
- What?

1044
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:53,087
What, are you tryin'
to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin everyone's appetite.

1045
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:57,425
Hey, hey. l... Mike, right?
You wanna come to my party tomorrow?

1046
01:16:57,508 --> 01:17:00,052
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

1047
01:17:00,177 --> 01:17:03,556
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

1048
01:17:05,433 --> 01:17:08,978
<i>How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.</i>

1049
01:17:09,061 --> 01:17:13,065
<i>This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...</i>

1050
01:17:13,149 --> 01:17:17,778
<i>for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.</i>

1051
01:17:17,862 --> 01:17:20,740
<i>We at Burger Barn are committed...</i>

1052
01:17:20,823 --> 01:17:25,870
<i>- "to a very special relationship with"
you, one that will last and last.
- Hi.</i>

1053
01:17:25,953 --> 01:17:29,373
<i>In a time when so many things
are falling apart...</i>

1054
01:17:29,457 --> 01:17:32,710
<i>Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...</i>

1055
01:17:33,878 --> 01:17:36,213
<i>a new breath of life.</i>

1056
01:17:36,297 --> 01:17:41,135
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed...

1057
01:17:41,218 --> 01:17:43,971
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

1058
01:18:07,745 --> 01:18:09,747
Come on!

1059
01:18:26,389 --> 01:18:30,059
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.

1060
01:18:30,142 --> 01:18:32,144
Okay.

1061
01:18:38,192 --> 01:18:41,320
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.
- So, I'm invited.

1062
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:46,909
Okay.

1063
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:57,086
- Do you not want me to go?
- No.

1064
01:18:57,169 --> 01:19:00,131
I mean, go if you want.

1065
01:19:03,759 --> 01:19:07,054
Oh, so this is...
is this how you want it?

1066
01:19:12,935 --> 01:19:15,396
I have to go.

1067
01:19:17,982 --> 01:19:20,359
Take care, okay?

1068
01:19:28,826 --> 01:19:30,828
Goodbye, Arnie.

1069
01:19:33,164 --> 01:19:36,083
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's get that bath.

1070
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:39,003
No. No!

1071
01:19:39,128 --> 01:19:41,547
Hey, Arnie?

1072
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:44,300
- Arnie?
- Guys!

1073
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,177
Arnie.

1074
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:49,055
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

1075
01:19:49,138 --> 01:19:52,350
Arnie.

1076
01:19:52,475 --> 01:19:54,393
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

1077
01:19:57,021 --> 01:19:59,398
- Arnie!
- Oh, no!
- Damn it!

1078
01:19:59,482 --> 01:20:03,110
Arnie, no!

1079
01:20:03,194 --> 01:20:06,280
Oh, God.

1080
01:20:06,364 --> 01:20:09,408
I can't make another one.
I can't.

1081
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:14,372
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

1082
01:20:30,846 --> 01:20:34,016
<i>Attention, Foodland shoppers.
Remember, every day this week...</i>

1083
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:36,143
<i>is a double coupon day.</i>

1084
01:20:45,736 --> 01:20:48,322
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

1085
01:20:48,447 --> 01:20:51,701
Um, my sister called in
an order for Grape.

1086
01:20:51,784 --> 01:20:53,953
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all set.

1087
01:20:55,830 --> 01:21:00,710
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

1088
01:21:17,727 --> 01:21:20,021
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

1089
01:21:20,104 --> 01:21:23,190
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's-What's in that box?

1090
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:25,192
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'm gonna kill you.

1091
01:21:25,276 --> 01:21:27,194
I can't believe you.

1092
01:21:27,278 --> 01:21:31,449
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

1093
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:33,743
Now, you'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

1094
01:21:33,826 --> 01:21:35,828
What am I
supposed to say to people?

1095
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:41,167
I mean, it's Arnie's 18th birthday.
Haven't you been waiting
to do this for a long time?

1096
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:44,462
I mean, wasn't it you that wanted to
have this huge party in the first place?

1097
01:21:44,545 --> 01:21:47,006
I didn't want to.

1098
01:21:48,341 --> 01:21:51,260
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

1099
01:21:51,344 --> 01:21:54,764
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.
- Look, he's eating the cake!

1100
01:21:54,847 --> 01:21:57,058
- Shit!
- Arnie!
- That's it. Forget it.

1101
01:21:57,141 --> 01:21:59,185
- Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.
- Arnie!

1102
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:01,228
Now what are we gonna do?

1103
01:22:02,021 --> 01:22:05,191
Arnie! Arnie.

1104
01:22:05,274 --> 01:22:07,401
Come here. Come here! Come here!

1105
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:11,864
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

1106
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:14,533
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

1107
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,086
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

1108
01:22:31,968 --> 01:22:35,221
- Get in that bath.
- Gilbert, no!
- Get your fucking clothes off.

1109
01:22:35,388 --> 01:22:37,306
Come on.

1110
01:22:38,891 --> 01:22:42,186
- Gilbert, no!
- Don't move. Don't move!

1111
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,063
Gilbert, stop!

1112
01:23:12,925 --> 01:23:14,885
Gilbert!

1113
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:16,971
What did you do?

1114
01:23:35,031 --> 01:23:37,325
Mama!

1115
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:40,953
Arnie?

1116
01:23:43,956 --> 01:23:45,541
Arnie!

1117
01:23:50,129 --> 01:23:52,131
What is goin' on?

1118
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:56,260
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

1119
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:50,541
- We should call his mother.
- No, no, no. It's okay. I know...

1120
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,918
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

1121
01:25:53,002 --> 01:25:55,004
It's really okay. Yeah.

1122
01:26:03,596 --> 01:26:05,806
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

1123
01:26:08,726 --> 01:26:10,853
You wanna go play, Arnie?

1124
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:32,667
Come on, Arnie.

1125
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:45,054
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it.

1126
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:50,601
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

1127
01:26:50,685 --> 01:26:53,771
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

1128
01:26:53,896 --> 01:26:56,065
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1129
01:26:56,148 --> 01:26:59,193
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

1130
01:26:59,277 --> 01:27:02,613
Yea! Yea!
You did it!

1131
01:27:03,823 --> 01:27:06,993
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

1132
01:27:13,624 --> 01:27:16,419
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

1133
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:18,671
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

1134
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:20,381
Take care.

1135
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:23,634
You know, I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.

1136
01:27:23,718 --> 01:27:26,387
No, you just got clean.

1137
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:31,726
Arnie!

1138
01:27:31,809 --> 01:27:34,228
Hi! How are you?

1139
01:27:38,316 --> 01:27:40,234
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

1140
01:27:40,318 --> 01:27:42,612
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

1141
01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:45,948
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1142
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:17,438
I hit him.

1143
01:28:17,563 --> 01:28:19,690
I hit him so hard, l...

1144
01:28:22,902 --> 01:28:25,446
He's gonna be okay.

1145
01:28:27,698 --> 01:28:30,326
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

1146
01:28:40,252 --> 01:28:44,256
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1147
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:16,872
I got nowhere to go.

1148
01:29:23,713 --> 01:29:26,340
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

1149
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,678
So it's your fault?

1150
01:29:30,803 --> 01:29:34,682
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

1151
01:29:34,765 --> 01:29:37,685
He didn't say goodbye.
He just...

1152
01:29:39,228 --> 01:29:42,940
One day, all of a sudden...

1153
01:29:45,443 --> 01:29:48,571
he was gone.

1154
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:50,948
He was just hangin' there.

1155
01:29:52,908 --> 01:29:55,411
That's when it all started.

1156
01:29:57,163 --> 01:30:00,249
She used to be so pretty.

1157
01:30:00,374 --> 01:30:05,087
She was so pretty
and so fun.

1158
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:10,092
So you think it's his fault?

1159
01:30:12,678 --> 01:30:15,431
No.

1160
01:30:15,514 --> 01:30:19,560
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

1161
01:30:19,644 --> 01:30:22,438
He was just sort of there.

1162
01:30:22,521 --> 01:30:25,942
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...

1163
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:29,153
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...

1164
01:30:29,236 --> 01:30:31,447
I don't know... get mad.

1165
01:30:33,366 --> 01:30:36,118
But nothin'.

1166
01:30:38,245 --> 01:30:40,915
Just like, uh, he was already dead.

1167
01:30:45,211 --> 01:30:47,463
I used to know a guy like that.

1168
01:32:13,507 --> 01:32:17,136
- Hey.
- Hi.

1169
01:32:21,933 --> 01:32:24,685
It's Arnie's birthday.

1170
01:32:24,769 --> 01:32:26,729
I need to go home.

1171
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,965
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1172
01:32:54,048 --> 01:32:56,050
Give my regards to your mother.

1173
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,638
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

1174
01:33:00,721 --> 01:33:03,182
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- He's alive.

1175
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:26,330
Amy?

1176
01:33:26,414 --> 01:33:28,416
Where's Arnie?

1177
01:33:32,461 --> 01:33:35,506
Amy. Please, Amy.

1178
01:33:39,885 --> 01:33:41,887
Is he okay?

1179
01:33:44,557 --> 01:33:46,642
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

1180
01:33:52,523 --> 01:33:54,942
Where is he?

1181
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:04,285
I wonder where he could be.

1182
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:15,379
Amy?

1183
01:34:18,132 --> 01:34:21,218
Have you seen Arnie?

1184
01:34:21,302 --> 01:34:23,846
Um, no, I thought he was with you.

1185
01:34:23,971 --> 01:34:26,182
- No.
- No?

1186
01:34:26,265 --> 01:34:27,767
No.

1187
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:37,318
Arnie?

1188
01:34:40,154 --> 01:34:42,990
Arnie? Anybody seen Arnie?

1189
01:34:45,159 --> 01:34:47,161
Where's my brother?

1190
01:34:51,999 --> 01:34:54,001
Boo!

1191
01:34:56,921 --> 01:34:58,756
Boo.

1192
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:09,141
Come here.

1193
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:11,060
You scared me, buddy.

1194
01:35:12,853 --> 01:35:16,649
You scared Gilbert.
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

1195
01:35:17,733 --> 01:35:20,653
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

1196
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:38,796
Come here.

1197
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:41,132
Who's got you?

1198
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:59,609
You better talk to Mama.

1199
01:36:03,738 --> 01:36:05,698
Mama?

1200
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:16,292
Mama?

1201
01:36:21,339 --> 01:36:23,466
What you did was...

1202
01:36:27,845 --> 01:36:29,764
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

1203
01:36:37,229 --> 01:36:39,857
And then disappearing like that?

1204
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:44,362
I hate that.

1205
01:36:44,445 --> 01:36:46,530
You know how I hate that.

1206
01:36:50,242 --> 01:36:52,870
You walked out,
and I thought...

1207
01:36:52,954 --> 01:36:55,122
I can't take another.

1208
01:36:58,542 --> 01:37:02,046
But you came back, Gilbert.

1209
01:37:02,129 --> 01:37:04,548
Why?

1210
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:06,384
Why did you?

1211
01:37:14,517 --> 01:37:16,519
I don't know, Mama.

1212
01:37:18,062 --> 01:37:22,566
I'm here now.
I'm here now.

1213
01:37:25,695 --> 01:37:28,030
Yes, you are.

1214
01:37:29,156 --> 01:37:31,200
You came back for the party.

1215
01:37:36,163 --> 01:37:39,792
Oh, Gilbert.

1216
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:43,796
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

1217
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:49,385
I know what a burden I am.

1218
01:37:49,468 --> 01:37:51,470
Don't say that.

1219
01:37:52,763 --> 01:37:55,224
I know it.

1220
01:37:55,308 --> 01:37:58,144
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

1221
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,148
No, I'm not.

1222
01:38:02,231 --> 01:38:04,775
No, I'm not.

1223
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:16,037
I never, never meant
to be like this.

1224
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:21,500
I never wanted to be a joke.

1225
01:38:21,584 --> 01:38:24,837
- You're no joke, Mama.
- I never wanted to be.

1226
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,298
You're no joke.

1227
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:30,259
- You're no joke.
- Oh, Gilbert.

1228
01:38:30,343 --> 01:38:34,347
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

1229
01:38:40,728 --> 01:38:45,733
- Hurry! Hurry!
- You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.

1230
01:38:45,858 --> 01:38:49,236
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

1231
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,322
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...

1232
01:38:51,405 --> 01:38:53,407
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

1233
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:57,036
You see how this...
the porch is slanted right here?

1234
01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:00,748
I mean, this is
a serious problem, Gilbert.
We need to get up underneath here...

1235
01:39:00,831 --> 01:39:03,918
First of all, we need to fill this in
so that no more water collects here.

1236
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:06,045
And then we'll probably...
What?

1237
01:39:12,927 --> 01:39:14,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

1238
01:39:14,553 --> 01:39:17,056
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

1239
01:39:19,392 --> 01:39:22,019
- You ready?
- For what?

1240
01:39:23,062 --> 01:39:25,982
I want you to...
I want you to come meet somebody.

1241
01:39:27,566 --> 01:39:29,443
Okay.

1242
01:39:29,527 --> 01:39:31,946
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi.

1243
01:39:32,029 --> 01:39:35,324
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?

1244
01:39:35,408 --> 01:39:37,410
Thank you!

1245
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,793
Mama?

1246
01:39:48,462 --> 01:39:51,507
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

1247
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:55,845
- No!
- Please?

1248
01:39:58,264 --> 01:40:00,683
- Just this once, for me?
- Gilbert, it's okay.

1249
01:40:00,766 --> 01:40:03,894
- We can do it later.
- No. This is what I want.

1250
01:40:05,271 --> 01:40:07,607
Do it for me, please?

1251
01:40:07,690 --> 01:40:10,693
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

1252
01:40:10,776 --> 01:40:13,529
I'm not gonna hurt you
any more, Mama.

1253
01:40:13,613 --> 01:40:16,157
I promise.

1254
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:19,160
Please.

1255
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:24,624
Okay.

1256
01:40:24,707 --> 01:40:28,169
Okay. Becky?

1257
01:40:36,928 --> 01:40:39,931
Mama, this is Becky.

1258
01:40:40,014 --> 01:40:42,391
- Hello.
- Hi.

1259
01:40:49,482 --> 01:40:52,026
I haven't always been like this.

1260
01:40:54,153 --> 01:40:56,989
I haven't always been like this.

1261
01:41:04,163 --> 01:41:06,582
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

1262
01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:09,043
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle. I can believe that.

1263
01:41:09,168 --> 01:41:11,587
I'm just gonna put this up here.

1264
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:15,091
- Uh, bye.
- Goodbye, Arnie.

1265
01:41:15,174 --> 01:41:16,968
- Bye.
- You take care.

1266
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,312
I had a really nice time.

1267
01:41:30,773 --> 01:41:32,316
I know.

1268
01:41:41,742 --> 01:41:45,538
- I don't know what to say.
- Say, "Thank you," Gilbert.

1269
01:41:45,621 --> 01:41:47,790
Say, "Thank you."

1270
01:41:57,174 --> 01:41:59,135
Thank you.

1271
01:42:07,101 --> 01:42:11,022
- Goodbye.
- No, it's not goodbye, Arnie.

1272
01:42:11,105 --> 01:42:16,027
It's goodnight. Goodnight...
Goodnight to you, but not me.

1273
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:18,279
Hey, they're coming!

1274
01:42:18,362 --> 01:42:21,407
Bye! Wait!

1275
01:42:42,053 --> 01:42:44,847
Mama?

1276
01:42:48,643 --> 01:42:50,519
Mama, what are you doing?

1277
01:42:57,652 --> 01:42:59,862
<i>To work in Danny's office.</i>

1278
01:43:02,198 --> 01:43:04,158
<i>I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

1279
01:43:04,283 --> 01:43:06,243
<i>Oh, I am pleased.</i>

1280
01:43:08,663 --> 01:43:11,082
<i>So close your eyes.</i>

1281
01:43:37,858 --> 01:43:40,778
Amy? Amy?

1282
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,702
You rest, Mama.

1283
01:43:49,412 --> 01:43:51,414
You deserve to rest.

1284
01:43:53,624 --> 01:43:56,794
Amy, get me my birthday boy.

1285
01:43:56,877 --> 01:43:58,879
- I want my birthday boy.
- Okay.

1286
01:43:58,963 --> 01:44:02,508
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

1287
01:44:02,592 --> 01:44:04,594
Gilbert.

1288
01:44:08,598 --> 01:44:11,017
You're my knight
in shimmering armour.

1289
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,144
Did you know that?

1290
01:44:14,228 --> 01:44:16,272
I think you mean shining.

1291
01:44:17,231 --> 01:44:20,651
No. Shimmering.

1292
01:44:20,818 --> 01:44:23,112
You shimmer and you glow.

1293
01:44:30,328 --> 01:44:35,082
You rest, okay?
Get some sleep.

1294
01:44:51,098 --> 01:44:53,100
Hey!

1295
01:44:55,227 --> 01:44:57,188
Mama!

1296
01:44:59,065 --> 01:45:01,817
Mama! Mama!

1297
01:45:01,901 --> 01:45:04,236
Wake up!

1298
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:08,240
You're hiding, huh?

1299
01:45:10,534 --> 01:45:12,495
I know that.

1300
01:45:15,247 --> 01:45:17,249
Wake up!

1301
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:23,547
Mama, wake up!

1302
01:45:55,746 --> 01:45:59,250
Mama, stop it now!

1303
01:45:59,333 --> 01:46:01,460
Stop, Mama!

1304
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,465
Stop it.

1305
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:15,766
Arnie? Arnie?

1306
01:46:18,394 --> 01:46:20,396
What's wrong?

1307
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:22,481
What's wrong? Stop it!

1308
01:46:23,608 --> 01:46:26,068
Gilbert!

1309
01:46:26,152 --> 01:46:28,154
Gilbert!

1310
01:46:29,572 --> 01:46:31,824
- Arnie!
- Don't... Give me... Stop!

1311
01:47:11,781 --> 01:47:13,741
Mom!

1312
01:47:26,921 --> 01:47:29,090
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

1313
01:47:30,508 --> 01:47:34,262
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

1314
01:47:34,345 --> 01:47:37,848
<i>You may need the National Guard
to move her out of there.</i>

1315
01:47:37,932 --> 01:47:39,934
I'm sorry about that.

1316
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:53,614
l-It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

1317
01:47:58,035 --> 01:48:00,246
There's gonna be a crowd.

1318
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:04,500
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

1319
01:49:13,778 --> 01:49:15,988
She's so beautiful.

1320
01:49:16,113 --> 01:49:18,783
She's no joke. She's no joke.

1321
01:49:28,709 --> 01:49:31,087
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

1322
01:49:52,316 --> 01:49:53,985
Arnie.

1323
01:49:56,112 --> 01:49:58,447
We're gonna need your help.

1324
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:13,643
Gilbert, is that them?

1325
01:53:13,726 --> 01:53:16,187
No. No, not yet.

1326
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:19,690
- When are they gonna come?
- Pretty soon.

1327
01:53:19,774 --> 01:53:21,984
Pretty soon.

1328
01:53:22,068 --> 01:53:24,737
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

1329
01:53:25,863 --> 01:53:29,033
Nineteen.

1330
01:53:29,116 --> 01:53:31,744
Gilbert, look there!

1331
01:53:31,827 --> 01:53:34,372
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

1332
01:53:34,455 --> 01:53:36,123
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

1333
01:53:36,207 --> 01:53:38,960
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

1334
01:53:39,043 --> 01:53:40,878
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go, too, and I said...

1335
01:53:40,962 --> 01:53:45,591
"Well, we can go anywhere
if we want.

1336
01:53:45,675 --> 01:53:48,678
- Becky!
- We can go anywhere."

1337
01:53:48,761 --> 01:53:50,763
Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?

1338
01:53:50,846 --> 01:53:53,140
Yep. She's comin'.

1339
01:53:53,224 --> 01:53:55,559
Becky!

1340
01:53:55,643 --> 01:53:57,937
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.

1341
01:54:14,954 --> 01:54:16,664
Hey!

1342
01:54:21,252 --> 01:54:23,254
Hi! Hi.

1343
01:54:23,337 --> 01:54:26,007
Hi! Hi!

1344
01:54:27,425 --> 01:54:30,344
- I'm fine.
- Hi!
- How are you?
