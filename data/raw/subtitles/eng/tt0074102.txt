1
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:26,148
IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES

2
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,645
Awake already?

3
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,475
It's so cold. It's too early
to get up.

4
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,584
- Let's sleep a little longer.
- I can't sleep.

5
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,656
I can't go to sleep
so early.

6
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,656
That's natural.

7
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,524
When I began working here,
I had the same problem.

8
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:14,638
You're so attractive. Far too
lovely fore a place like this.

9
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:20,642
Yesterday, when I first saw you,
I knew we'd get along.

10
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,614
Kiss me, Sada.

11
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,650
No, your hands are too cold.

12
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,688
I love stroking your skin;
it's so smooth.

13
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,726
Sada, don't you like it
when I caress you?

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,733
Listen...

15
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,836
Each morning is just like this.
Afterward, he goes to market.

16
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,539
Let's play a game.
You first.

17
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,768
Lucky in love.
Love is blind!

18
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,943
- Blind man's bluff!
- Bluff at love!

19
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,913
Love's a bluff!

20
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,954
What are you children up to?
What are you doing?

21
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,895
Stop! Leave the poor man alone!

22
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,461
You heard what she said.
Leave him alone!

23
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,135
- Oh! It's horrible!
- Horrible!

24
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,781
Get away,
you filthy little tramps!

25
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,850
Get out of here!
I said out!

26
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,959
No, wait! I know you!

27
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,863
Let go of me!
I don't know you!

28
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,840
Don't touch her!
Keep your filthy hands off her!

29
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,941
Just wait a second.
I know I've seen you.

30
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:51,056
It was in Osaka or Nagoya...

31
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,188
Tokyo!

32
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,190
It's you, all right!
You were the nicest one there.

33
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,558
I used to be one of
your best customers.

34
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,933
You must remember me!

35
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,931
How can I remember someone
I've never laid eyes on?

36
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,895
I want you!
I want you now!

37
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,937
Look. I have money.
I can pay you!

38
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,911
Please, just this once.
Once, that's all.

39
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,789
I beg of you!

40
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,986
You've been waiting
all day?

41
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,036
God bless you!
You're still the nicest one.

42
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,001
Sit down.

43
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,407
Did you mean it, saying you'd
never seen me before?

44
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,076
But I never have.

45
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,114
What now? How can I do
anything with that?

46
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,684
Are you cold?

47
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,217
No, no, it would be easier
if I could see your...

48
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,227
I doubt it, but we can try.

49
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,279
You'll catch cold.

50
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,044
You'd better put it away
before it freezes.

51
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,217
Poor old thing.

52
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,454
Stop wasting time!
Hurry up now!

53
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,695
Where have you been?

54
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,628
Here. Take this tray in
immediately!

55
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,099
Better change your ways.
We have a reputation to uphold.

56
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,139
Don't look at me that way!

57
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,045
Stop it! Stop!

58
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,871
Stop!

59
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,075
Now stop this immediately!
What have you against her?

60
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,110
She's nothing but a whore,
a common whore...

61
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,982
and that's all
she'll ever be!

62
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,017
Let me go!
I'll kill her!

63
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,124
- I said stop it!
- You bitch!

64
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,126
What do you have against whores?
Who do you think you are?

65
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,801
Enough!
You too!

66
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,038
I've had enough! You're both
to blame! Get back to work!

67
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,132
- Filthy whore!
- Let me go!

68
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,074
What's going on here?

69
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,082
You're behaving
like children.

70
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,252
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new here? Answer me.

71
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,157
What's your name?

72
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,025
Sada.

73
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,098
Abe Sada.

74
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:56,039
This wouldn't occur if you were
here to help now and then.

75
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,113
Give me the knife.

76
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,078
What beautiful hands you have.

77
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,080
Why use them fore violence...

78
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,851
when you could use them
fore other things.

79
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,425
That's a lovely sight!

80
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,875
No, don't stop.
Go on working.

81
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:41,117
If you f ear getting burned, girl
don't play with fire

82
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,152
I like the sway
of your hips.

83
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,655
A girl like you can stab a man's
heart without a knife, huh?

84
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,196
Little girl, there's a fire...

85
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,637
How many hearts have you broken?
T ell me.

86
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,046
What are you doing, Master?

87
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,287
You like it, don't you.
I know you do.

88
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,552
But listen, Master.

89
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,560
I have a man in my life
who gets very jealous.

90
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:31,268
I know all about your man.
Your gigolo's bankrupt.

91
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,509
- You work here to pay his debts.
- Yes.

92
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,276
Life is hard.

93
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,675
Besides, you aren't
that virtuous, are you?

94
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,315
I was told this house has
a respectable reputation.

95
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,354
Of course, you're right.

96
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,991
A respectable house
with a respectable master.

97
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,602
Haven't you finished yet?
Hurry!

98
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,034
Good evening, Master.
Are you alone tonight?

99
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,230
I'm not allowed
to go out at night...

100
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,070
and so the master becomes
the client.

101
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,310
Why aren't you allowed
out at night?

102
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,311
There are too many temptations.

103
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,258
Mistress told me
to serve a customer.

104
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:14,896
- I had no idea it was you.
- Now you know.

105
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,404
This path is filled
with hidden treasure

106
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,146
Leading man
to eternal pleasure

107
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,379
What's the matter? Are you
ashamed of your desire?

108
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,358
Life is made fore pleasure.
Come, Sada.

109
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,406
I love it.

110
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,353
If you go on, l--

111
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,321
The geisha will be here soon.

112
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,365
I can't stand it.

113
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,363
- You want me to stop?
- Yes, yes.

114
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,401
It's driving me mad.

115
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,809
Mad? Why?
T ell me why.

116
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,409
I f eel reborn.

117
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,181
Good evening. I'm the geisha
you invited.

118
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,820
- May I come in?
- In a moment.

119
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:44,455
- I'm busy right now. Just wait.
- I'm in no hurry, sir.

120
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,946
Okay, you can come in now.

121
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,449
- Now I'm here.
- Yes.

122
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,456
Good evening to you.

123
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,438
A lovely young girl!

124
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,525
- Where are you going?
- T o the bathroom.

125
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,066
Well, go.

126
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,571
But I can wait...
if you wish.

127
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,535
I've heard it's better
if you wait a little.

128
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,446
Slowly. There's no hurry.

129
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,521
Last night, l...

130
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,526
I came too soon fore you!

131
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,464
Think of yourself.

132
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,565
I want to f eel your pleasure.
Don't think of me.

133
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,632
I want you to f eel free.

134
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,508
It's fore you that I hold back.

135
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,607
I can't stop. I--

136
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,704
Now you'll start over again
with your wife, won't you?

137
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,580
How can you make love to her
at the same hour each day?

138
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,486
So you've seen us?
You were watching, huh?

139
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,125
Yes. I won't let you return to her
until I've satisfied you.

140
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,658
You torture yourself
fore nothing.

141
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,701
We have plenty of time.
All the time in the world.

142
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,636
We haven't. Master,
it will be sunrise soon.

143
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,637
I said not to worry
about me.

144
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,687
You're an extraordinary woman.

145
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,679
I can't go on.
Let me stop playing.

146
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,675
You must go on
in place of the geisha.

147
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,746
I didn't invite her so you and l
could be alone tonight.

148
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,888
But you must keep playing
and singing...

149
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,491
or my wife
will become suspicious.

150
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,791
- Why don't you sing instead?
- You sing a bit longer.

151
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,837
Excuse me, Mistress.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

152
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,999
Come in.

153
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,971
I'm grateful fore your kindness,
but f eel unworthy of your trust.

154
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,912
I'd like permission
to leave here.

155
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,847
There's no problem of trust.
That's silly.

156
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,781
Go get me some water instead,
okay?

157
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:52,985
Yes.

158
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,972
I want you to stay.
I am quite satisfied with you.

159
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,519
You seem like
a very serious girl.

160
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,919
I really wonder why you should
go away and leave us.

161
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,575
- Oh, God.
- What?

162
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,074
My period just started.

163
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,882
It doesn't matter.

164
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,337
Hello. Anyone home?

165
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,948
You're going to see me naked
fore the first time.

166
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,913
- Are you shy?
- A little, yes.

167
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,023
You undress first.

168
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,026
Wait. Let me.
I want to undress you.

169
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,935
How young and beautiful
you are!

170
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,973
I love the texture of your skin.
So smooth, like velvet.

171
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,278
You devour men.

172
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,014
Are you reproaching me
fore wanting you too much?

173
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,165
You know, I'm no longer young.
I envy your youth.

174
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,606
I love to caress your body.

175
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,043
I f eel like biting you all over.

176
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,122
Sorry, may I bring in
the sake?

177
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,126
I was afraid you wouldn't be able
to go into town tonight.

178
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,023
I haven't gone into town.

179
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,026
This is our home.
Just yours and mine.

180
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,030
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever heard.

181
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,155
We wish you joy
and happiness.

182
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,153
Now what am l
supposed to do?

183
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,787
You mustn't ask me.
Aren't you the bride?

184
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,164
How should I know? I've never
been married before.

185
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,202
T rue enough. If my young bride
had already been married...

186
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,099
then I'd be missing something
tonight!

187
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,204
All this said, let's celebrate
this great event together.

188
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,505
Rejoice with us on the happiest
day of our lives.

189
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:00,253
The time has come to celebrate
your first night together.

190
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,427
Nervous?

191
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,160
- It's a great moment.
- It is!

192
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,168
What if the bride and groom
aren't exactly strangers?

193
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,529
Nothing changes.

194
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,901
While she's not a virgin,
she saved her virginity fore you...

195
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,573
and pleasure comes
with experience.

196
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,637
Really?

197
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,308
Really?

198
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:25,250
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Master, I'm ready now.

199
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,259
Don't call me "Master." From now on,
call me Kichi-san, okay?

200
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,322
Thank you... Kichi-san.

201
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,194
Sada.

202
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,145
What is it?

203
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,176
You're trembling.
What's wrong?

204
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,075
What's the matter?

205
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:00,352
I don't know.
I'm shaking all over.

206
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,330
Let's begin.

207
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,218
- You look very interested.
- Get closer!

208
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,284
- You'll get a better view.
- It's the only way to learn.

209
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,249
Come on. There's nothing
to be afraid of.

210
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,246
No, no, leave me alone!

211
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,358
- Go on!
- You should know more about men.

212
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,859
Look well!

213
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,356
Keep your eyes open.
Don't close them. Look!

214
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,566
It won't hurt fore long!

215
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,809
The pain is so great, I can't
bear it. It's too agonizing!

216
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,403
Kosome, it's your turn now!

217
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,449
Can I make the bed?

218
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,325
- He's not awake yet. Do it later.
- Okay.

219
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,430
- What time is it?
- It's almost 12:00.

220
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,938
It's noon already.

221
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,744
Kichi-san, it's noon.
Wake up.

222
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,917
Morning.

223
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,525
Did you hold it all night,
or was it a dream?

224
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,724
It wasn't a dream.

225
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,657
You mean you didn't
sleep at all?

226
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,226
I spent the night looking at you.

227
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,099
I couldn't stop.

228
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,463
You're wonderful.
You're so young.

229
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,466
How can you look so lovely
and fresh without sleep?

230
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,478
Makes me jealous!

231
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,445
Are you in that big of a hurry?
Give me a minute, okay?

232
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,310
- I want you now.
- I've got to pee. Okay with you?

233
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,484
There's no need to leave.
Do it here.

234
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,018
Where?

235
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,458
Inside of Sada,
all nice and warm.

236
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:36,657
You're mad! It's impossible
to do both at the same time.

237
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,666
We can try and see
what happens.

238
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,107
Can't you wait one minute?

239
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,542
I can't. I'm tired of waiting.
I want you now.

240
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,547
You're insatiable!

241
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,523
You want to make love
all the time, huh?

242
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,493
You don't think it's wrong,
do you?

243
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,565
I think it's wonderful.
You're beautiful.

244
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,443
I was afraid of not
being like others.

245
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:29,415
I was so worried about it,
I even went to see a doctor.

246
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,212
He said I was sensitive
where sex was concerned.

247
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:34,590
Sensitive?

248
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,591
I hope it's incurable.

249
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,592
Because I adore
your oversensitivity.

250
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,985
Take me now!

251
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,992
I want you now.
I can't wait any longer.

252
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,054
Slowly.

253
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,558
No, I can't wait!

254
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,132
Why so cheerful?

255
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:59,199
I was thinking that the only way
my penis can rest...

256
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,640
is when it must go and pee,
isn't that so?

257
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,411
That's right.

258
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,119
I know one thing.

259
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:25,098
It doesn't take you long,
once you've finished, to start again.

260
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,776
You see? It's just as I said.

261
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,653
You make it so obedient
to your touch.

262
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,152
I often wonder
whose it is.

263
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,186
It's all mine!

264
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,326
Why does it become so hard
suddenly?

265
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,828
Do you know why?

266
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,665
That's because...

267
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,710
because it wants you more than
anything in the world.

268
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,448
Please. I can wait no longer!

269
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,725
- We can be seen here.
- Let them watch. I don't care.

270
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,240
Well, grandmother,
working hard, huh?

271
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,299
Yes. It keeps
an old woman busy!

272
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,224
We'd better part here.

273
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,757
Not yet. Let's separate
just before you reach home.

274
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,758
Leave it alone.
Don't you realize it's tired?

275
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,458
My servants will see us.
Let go of me, please.

276
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,196
How can l?
It's so nice and hard.

277
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,765
That's because you're holding it.
Let go.

278
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,828
On one condition. That you
take me now, right here!

279
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,119
- Pardon me. I have your sake.
- Come in.

280
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,819
You're not in bed together
fore once? That's unusual.

281
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,796
I had to bring the sake.
The servants won't come in here.

282
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,294
Why's that?

283
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,874
- You're always in the middle of --
- Of what?

284
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,037
Taking it in my mouth
and sucking it.

285
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,853
I'd appreciate it
if you'd care fore Kichi.

286
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,152
I must leave,
but I'll return tomorrow.

287
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,893
Watch him closely.

288
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,767
He's to stay here. He's not
allowed to go out, understand?

289
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:48,865
I'll do what I can.
What about the geishas?

290
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,072
- They can come if he wants them.
- Really?

291
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,891
Do I look elegant?

292
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,964
You look lovelier every day.

293
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,894
Not again!

294
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:29,869
You make me feel things
I've never felt.

295
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,614
Scandalous!

296
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,425
I know we need the money...

297
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,892
but when I think of you
with someone else, I get jealous.

298
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,801
Jealous? If you really
get jealous, that's wonderful.

299
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,235
Tomorrow it'll be over.

300
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,647
He's a school director
and an alderman.

301
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,713
Very intellectual.

302
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:12,889
- You like intellectuals, huh?
- I do. They're so generous!

303
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:48,024
Kichi-san, I've decided to wear
your kimono while I'm gone.

304
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,452
Why?

305
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,160
T o insure you don't return
to your house.

306
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,128
You want me to stay naked
while you're away?

307
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,936
I'll lend you mine.

308
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,970
- Here. Try it on.
- If you insist.

309
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,046
Well?

310
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,533
May I pour you some sake?

311
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,066
Don't you want some, sir?

312
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:17,670
You must eat something.
It's important.

313
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,982
The two of you are impossible.
You never eat.

314
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,185
Listen, sir. Leave now.
Don't wait fore her to return.

315
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,254
Go before it's too late!

316
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,928
If you stay, that woman
will end up killing you.

317
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,856
What are you doing?
Let me go!

318
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,087
Master, you seem tired
this afternoon.

319
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,862
You know that you needn't
sleep with me.

320
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,024
When you haven't wanted to,
I've understood.

321
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,297
It isn't easy fore me.

322
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,038
I can't spend my nights alone
waiting fore you.

323
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,767
There's no need fore that.
Why don't you sleep alone?

324
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:23,509
You promised to try, didn't you?
You swore you'd try.

325
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,947
It's different with you...

326
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:31,019
because I'm very fond of you
and I respect you.

327
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,015
Do you understand, Master?

328
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,964
I want you to beat me now!

329
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,161
- Slap me hard!
- Sada!

330
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,998
Beat me hard!

331
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,139
More, and harder!

332
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,074
Pinch me!
Pinch me now!

333
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,016
Keep pinching!
Don't stop!

334
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,081
Make it hurt. Go on.
Harder!

335
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,856
Now, pull-- Pull my hair!

336
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,122
Pull it!

337
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,363
More!

338
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,665
Make it hurt!

339
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:25,137
I want to f eel pain!
Please, don't stop!

340
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,155
How have you been?

341
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,123
- I've got money too!
- Really?

342
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,520
Let's go spend it!

343
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,134
I missed you so much.

344
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,176
I'm never going
to leave you again.

345
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:49,148
- Let me love you this time.
- If you like.

346
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:54,221
You lead and I'll follow.

347
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,171
Wait and see how good I am.
You promised I could lead.

348
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,072
You look radiant!

349
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,142
You're so alive and happy,
one would think you're 16!

350
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,186
It's good to be home.

351
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:26,189
I love to watch you
going in and out of me.

352
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,664
I adore it.

353
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,795
I adore it.

354
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,249
Don't move.

355
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,264
What was it like
with your intellectual?

356
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:47,300
I want to know exactly.
Show me.

357
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:54,243
No, it tickles.

358
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,915
He found it erotic.
It didn't tickle him!

359
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,278
So, he's a lecherous
school director.

360
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,459
"Listen, Sada, your future
depends on your virtue...

361
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,292
so you'd better change
your ways."

362
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,441
Then, was he virtuous?

363
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,947
Oh, yes. Very.
He was very well-behaved.

364
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,307
What about you?

365
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,287
Please don't be angry.

366
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:36,358
I suddenly thought of you
and I lost control.

367
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,328
I don't know why...

368
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:46,162
but I asked him to beat me
as hard as he could.

369
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,431
And your intellectual?
What did he do?

370
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,513
Come on, Sada. Hit me.

371
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,180
Why?

372
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,144
Beat me!

373
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,392
More!

374
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,359
Go on. Harder!

375
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,427
Harder!
Harder!

376
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,565
Even harder!

377
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,400
Don't stop! Harder!

378
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:38,405
All we do, even eating,
must be an act of love.

379
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,855
I love it.

380
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:04,370
I'm still hungry. My pleasure
lies in giving you pleasure.

381
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,109
and obeying your every desire.

382
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,986
Wonderful appetizer!

383
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,418
I want an egg now.
You want one?

384
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,412
Kichi-san! I want you
to get it out. Come!

385
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,415
Take it out right now!

386
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,251
How can l
if you're sitting down?

387
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,149
Haven't you ever watched
a hen lay an egg?

388
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,358
- Like this?
- That's right.

389
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,430
Now push, that's all.
It'll come out.

390
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,927
There it is.

391
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,539
- You got it.
- Eat it!

392
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,437
Sada, don't.
We're not alone.

393
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,604
I don't care!
I want you now!

394
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,410
- What's that fore?
- T o cut it off!

395
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,354
Why?

396
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,090
So it won't ever go inside
anyone else!

397
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,727
It's never betrayed you.
I swear.

398
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,423
I don't believe it. You'll use it
to make love to other women.

399
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,428
Cut it off if you want,
but you'll regret it.

400
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:42,101
No, Kichi-san.
Why will I regret it?

401
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:46,504
That way, I'll have it
inside me forever.

402
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,708
Cut it, then, if you want.

403
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:57,586
If I cut it off,
do you think you'll die?

404
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,882
Most likely.

405
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,519
I don't want you to die.

406
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,155
Then I won't die.

407
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,392
I promised to be with you
forever, didn't l?

408
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,135
I said I would set you up
in a small inn.

409
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,570
I won't be the "other woman."

410
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,867
I won't share you
with your wife.

411
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,472
You belong to Sada
and to no one else!

412
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:28,243
Listen. I'll end up a skeleton
if we're always together.

413
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,017
There'll be nothing left
of Kichi-san at all!

414
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,621
You don't want me.
Is that what you're saying?

415
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:41,457
Though reduced to a skeleton,
I'll never leave you.

416
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:46,567
I won't let you go even if you
are a skeleton, okay?

417
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:56,603
Could you stop threatening me
with that knife? It's dangerous!

418
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:11,491
You don't want to grow a beard.
You'll look awful.

419
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:20,566
Swear you'll never make love
to your wife again.

420
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,402
I swear.

421
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:27,209
- Repeat: "I'll never do it again."
- I'll never do it again.

422
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,237
Say: "You may kill me
if I ever make love to her."

423
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,545
I allow you to kill me
if I make love to her.

424
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,640
- Shall we scare her?
- Good idea.

425
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,045
I'm a ghost.

426
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,547
- The haunted parasol!
- I've come to haunt you!

427
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,625
Watch out fore my spear!

428
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:24,189
- Why don't you make love to her?
- No! She's not my type!

429
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,979
I'm sorry, but it's closing time.

430
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,327
Look! Like it? It's lovely,
don't you think?

431
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:55,922
If you serve us a drink,
you can play with it.

432
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,768
I'm not much good anymore.
I only use it to pee.

433
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,649
Let's stay together always!

434
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,604
I caught you! Don't be afraid.
Come. Sit next to me. Come on.

435
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,841
I'm going to catch you!

436
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,768
Don't! It hurts!

437
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,699
Let go of me!
She's hurting me!

438
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,725
Hear that? Do you think
it's a burglar?

439
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,231
No. A burglar wouldn't make
all that noise.

440
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:50,846
It's probably a drunk.
Don't worry. Come back to bed.

441
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,712
I know who it is. That whore
of yours, watching us.

442
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,085
Go to sleep.

443
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,348
Going to see her,
aren't you?

444
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,986
You came in so quietly
you scared me.

445
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,857
Don't worry about it.

446
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,748
Excuse me, Master.
You're wanted on the phone.

447
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,112
Wait.

448
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,126
Good evening.

449
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:31,765
Good evening, sir.

450
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,643
I warned you!

451
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:40,805
I warned you!

452
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,848
I want the truth. You made love
to your wife, didn't you?

453
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:49,923
Stop playing with that knife
as if you wielded a dagger.

454
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,353
You won't kill anyone
with that.

455
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,862
I wanted to buy a sword
to kill you!

456
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,831
Why didn't you go through with it,
if it was your intention?

457
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,869
How? I didn't dare
with everyone staring.

458
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,902
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly!

459
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,769
How would anyone guess why you
wanted a dagger? You're mad!

460
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,810
It's all you think of. It's a
fixation, an obsession. Know that?

461
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,782
So you think I'm mad because
I can't stop thinking of you?

462
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,884
Is that what you call
an obsession?

463
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,586
Take off your kimono.
Take it off!

464
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,984
It's hideous.
Take it off.

465
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,993
Are you going to
take it off?

466
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,820
In this position,
it's not easy.

467
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,431
I can't undress alone.
You must help me.

468
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,992
You undress me, would you?

469
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,038
Be honest!

470
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,114
You made love to your wife,
didn't you?

471
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:54,479
Look at it! There's your answer.
It's been faithful.

472
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,916
- Apologize!
- Why should it apologize?

473
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,994
It has no reason
to apologize.

474
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:05,924
It knows what it wants!
I'll punish it! You'll see!

475
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,899
Go on. Yes, punish it
as much as you like!

476
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,205
That hurt me!

477
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,636
- Does it hurt?
- It certainly does.

478
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,303
Are you pretending,
or does it hurt?

479
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,708
It really hurts.

480
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,045
Yet you love it
all the same!

481
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,113
It's true.

482
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,155
Say, "Bite harder
and harder!"

483
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,153
Bite harder and harder.

484
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,124
- Say, "Hurt me, Sada."
- Hurt me.

485
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:12,964
I want to hurt you. I want you
to f eel pain, to suffer!

486
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,936
Go on. Punish me!

487
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:32,051
Hurt me as much as you want,
whenever you want!

488
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,946
Forgive me fore having left you
alone these past 3 days. I'm sorry.

489
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:39,020
I almost went mad!
I can't be without you!

490
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,521
Forgive me.

491
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,932
Sada, you're crying.
You're crying.

492
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,265
- Because I love you.
- Sada, look at me.

493
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,576
It's the first time I've
seen you cry. Look at me.

494
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,679
- I don't want to!
- Look at me!

495
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:03,915
Your tears are so salty.
I love to taste them.

496
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:09,022
Hold me closer, Kichi-san.
Don't ever leave me again!

497
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,056
Can I bring in the sake?

498
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,599
Come in.

499
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,164
Bring it over here, please.
We're inseparable.

500
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,275
Don't you ever eat anything?

501
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,040
No, no. It makes the body heavy.
It puts you to sleep.

502
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,588
The room must be cleaned
now and then.

503
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,986
Haven't you noticed the smell?

504
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:45,123
We love the smell in here.
It excites us even more.

505
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:58,840
Wake up and open your eyes.

506
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,312
You seem to get
even greater pleasure...

507
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:08,042
when you're strangled
while making love.

508
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,082
You clutched my throat
the other day and...

509
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:16,381
it felt good.

510
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:21,052
Did you en joy it?
Strangle me, right now.

511
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,331
Okay.

512
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,106
Ready? I'm starting.

513
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:36,135
As I press on your throat,
you'll f eel a contraction lower down.

514
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,477
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

515
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,311
Press harder.

516
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,018
Now, what do you f eel?

517
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:03,231
- Don't be afraid. Harder.
- I should stop. You're flushed.

518
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:07,773
It doesn't matter.
Press harder. Don't worry.

519
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,042
I'll do as you say,
but it'll be painful.

520
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,177
Don't be angry
if I hurt you.

521
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,322
You don't want me to stop?

522
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,661
Answer me.

523
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:37,495
T o reach total pleasure you
must go almost to the end.

524
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,302
- How did it make you f eel?
- I didn't like it.

525
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,205
It's because you didn't
press hard enough.

526
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:49,278
I won't go on. I get no pleasure
from torturing you.

527
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,182
Then let's change places.
I'll strangle you.

528
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,628
May I begin?

529
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,692
Go ahead.

530
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,373
- It tickles.
- You're frightened, huh?

531
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,137
It's you who's hesitating.
Go on. I'm ready.

532
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:26,211
Yes, it's beginning
to get hard.

533
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,221
I f eel it inside me
getting harder.

534
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,299
I'm choking.

535
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,267
Do it slowly.

536
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:49,238
Now, I'm ready.

537
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,319
It f eels so good.

538
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,258
- I've never felt like this.
- Feels good?

539
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:14,230
- I f eel it moving!
- Feels good?

540
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,236
I can f eel it.

541
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,326
It's moving.

542
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,312
Can't breathe.

543
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,920
- The geishas won't come in here.
- Why's that?

544
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,923
Because of your reputation.

545
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,160
Reputation. What do they say
about us? T ell me.

546
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,333
- That you're disgusting.
- Say that again!

547
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,868
- Let them talk.
- It's not their business.

548
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,576
What's disgusting
about us?

549
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:33,075
Well, you do nothing but
suck him all day long.

550
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,283
What's wrong with that?

551
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,143
What's disgusting
about it?

552
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:41,188
Why shouldn't I taste the body
of the man I love? Come back!

553
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:42,682
Let her be.

554
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,859
- T ell me who's talking about us!
- Everyone!

555
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:49,292
Everyone?
Not everyone. It's you, huh?

556
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:53,300
Now, tell me if you think
we're disgusting. Well, do you?

557
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,709
Stop it!

558
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:08,950
Enough! She's only telling us
what she's heard.

559
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:15,218
Anyway, I don't care,
and you shouldn't either.

560
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,723
It doesn't matter what others
think of us.

561
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,295
I want you to rape her now!

562
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:25,196
No, don't, please.
I'll never marry if you do!

563
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,265
Get out!

564
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,363
You bitch! I can't bear
looking at you.

565
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,207
My respects to you both!

566
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,377
- She never stops sucking him!
- Good evening.

567
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:48,318
My! You are so virile
and forceful, Master.

568
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:52,724
- What should I play?
- Anything, as long as it's happy.

569
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:21,551
They say I'm disgusting.
What do you think? Am l?

570
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,257
How could they say so?

571
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,893
I never get enough of his body,
and I love it without restraint.

572
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:32,027
It's wonderful fore a woman
to f eel free with her lover.

573
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,168
You understand?
How old are you?

574
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,304
I'm 68 already.
How I envy your youth.

575
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:41,637
T ell me your opinion.
Do you find him attractive?

576
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,940
Oh, yes. I think
he's very attractive.

577
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,614
Would you like him?

578
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:51,277
I only meant
he was handsome.

579
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:56,020
If you like... I'll let him
make love to you.

580
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:17,541
It f eels so young.
Extraordinary.

581
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,697
Look at that.

582
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,513
Poor woman couldn't hold back
any longer.

583
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:07,707
Disgusting!

584
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,774
I hope the shock
didn't kill her.

585
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,918
You look pale suddenly?
What's the matter?

586
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,454
You look as if you've
seen a ghost.

587
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,522
Don't say that.

588
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:24,422
I had the impression I was holding
my mother's dead body.

589
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:30,834
- How long has she been dead?
- I was a child. What about yours?

590
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,867
She died 3 years ago.

591
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,535
I wasn't living at home
and didn't see her die.

592
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:39,538
I heard she suffered. And Papa,
he died when I was young.

593
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,544
Everything must have an end.

594
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,085
- Sada.
- Is anything wrong?

595
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,764
Let's be happy forever.

596
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,713
I'll leave you here.

597
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,152
You look very troubled today.

598
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,917
You look as if the weight
of the world were on you.

599
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:31,597
Might we go away alone
fore a week or so, Master?

600
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,366
Impossible!

601
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,637
If anyone knew of us, I'd have
to shoot myself in the head.

602
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,671
You're back? What happened?
Why did you return so soon?

603
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,140
Why did you go out?

604
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:53,937
You weren't here. I know it!
You let them clean the room!

605
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,647
Don't torture yourself.
I went fore a haircut.

606
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,112
I was here
the rest of the time.

607
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:02,523
I know you're lying!
I'll kill you!

608
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,649
You decided to get a haircut...

609
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,694
while I earned money
fore you to live on?

610
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,833
You told me your desire was
greater when I shaved my neck.

611
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,700
I desire you so, and one day
I'll use my knife on you.

612
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,179
You wouldn't do that to me.

613
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,011
T o be strangled is better.

614
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:35,455
Really? So you'd like me
to strangle you?

615
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,051
Put that knife away.

616
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,658
You like being strangled?

617
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,734
All I want is
to give you pleasure.

618
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,734
"l want to be strangled."
Say it!

619
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,109
I want to be strangled.

620
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,046
Don't pull too hard.

621
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,987
- You're frightened, huh?
- I'm terrified.

622
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,022
Are you serious?

623
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,798
You're teasing me.
You don't look terrified.

624
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,166
I'm ready.

625
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,343
Pull it tight.
Don't be afraid.

626
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,476
Pull much tighter.

627
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,591
Feel it getting harder?

628
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,221
Do you?

629
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,061
Go ahead. Pull as hard
as you can.

630
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,663
You can choke me tighter.

631
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,991
- Did I hurt you?
- Wait a moment.

632
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,029
Why did you stop?
I was near ecstasy.

633
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:47,973
Listen, I know what I'll do.
I'll tie your hands.

634
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,898
Now you can't resist.
You can't stop me.

635
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,801
That's right.

636
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,533
If you dare refuse,
I'll pull even tighter.

637
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:22,471
You know I belong to you.

638
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:26,475
Do what you please. My body
is yours-- yours forever.

639
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,914
I'll start again
and keep pulling harder.

640
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,125
Slowly this time.

641
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,975
Does it hurt you?

642
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:11,542
T ell what it f eels like.

643
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:18,352
Like I'm part of you.

644
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,959
Our bodies have melted into one,
bathing in a crimson pool.

645
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:30,766
Your expression is so strange.
You seem so distant.

646
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:35,473
- You frighten me. Say something.
- Say something? It's impossible.

647
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:39,812
You expect me to say something
when I can't breathe?

648
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,120
What give you pleasure
gives me happiness.

649
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:50,286
Do you want me
to kill you?

650
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,858
See?

651
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,858
I'm going to kill you.

652
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:13,871
I f eel good.

653
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,745
I'm coming.

654
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,323
I'll kill you, at last!

655
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,198
Happy, Sada?
Sada?

656
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,629
I want you to try again.

657
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:16,131
This time, I don't know
if I can do it again.

658
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,866
Think you'll be able to?

659
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,074
You look so sad.

660
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,751
I'm sleepy, Sada.
Sleepy, that's all.

661
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:04,363
If I fall asleep,
will you begin again?

662
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:10,440
You'd like me
to strangle you again?

663
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,076
Yes.

664
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:21,922
This time, Sada...

665
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:24,320
don't stop;
it's too painful afterwards.

666
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:08,919
Kichi-san.

667
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:12,595
Kichi-san.

668
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:23,437
I'm starting now.

669
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,519
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

670
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:17,993
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

671
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,700
Where are you now?

672
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:26,900
I'm not there yet.

673
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:32,212
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

674
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:36,439
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

675
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:39,645
Where are you now?

676
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:45,487
Where are you now?

677
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:52,029
Where are you now?

678
01:32:58,072 --> 01:32:59,972
Where are you now?

679
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:03,440
Where are you now?

680
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:25,662
Kichi-san!

681
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:35,966
Kichi-san.

682
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:45,235
For 4 days, carrying the part
she'd severed from his body...

683
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:48,942
Sada wandered through Tokyo.
