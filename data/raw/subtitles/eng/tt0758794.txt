1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,074
 

2
00:00:55,638 --> 00:01:00,476
<i>In the middle of Huntington,</i>
<i>West Virginia, there is a river.</i>

3
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>Next to this river, there is a steel mill.</i>

4
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:15,867
<i>And next to the steel mill,</i>
<i>there is a school.</i>

5
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,500
<i>In the middle of this school,</i>
<i>there is a fountain.</i>

6
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:32,425
<i>Each year, on the exact same day,</i>
<i>at the exact same hour...</i>

7
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>...the water to this fountain is turned off.</i>

8
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:40,016
<i>And in this moment, once every year...</i>

9
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:45,188
<i>...throughout the town,</i>
<i>throughout the school...</i>

10
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,774
<i>...time stands still.</i>

11
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,003
Chris Griffen with a reception.
That is a first down.

12
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:14,217
<i>But Marshall is all out of time-outs,</i>
<i>and the clock is now ticking.</i>

13
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:17,553
<i>If they wanna get another play off,</i>
<i>the Herd had better hurry.</i>

14
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,349
Call it in, Red! Call it in!

15
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,814
- Griffen! Okay, Chris Griffen! Hustle up!
- I'm good, I'm good.

16
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,691
The Herd looks a little disorganized.

17
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,071
They're looking for a play from the sideline,
and they are almost out of time.

18
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,366
<i>We are talking about seconds.</i>
<i>Marshall needs to get down and over--</i>

19
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,535
- 77-Victory. Go! Go, go, go!
- Yes, sir.

20
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,537
77-Victory. You're out.

21
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,416
V, 77! V, 77!

22
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:54,924
Come on! Snap the ball!

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,301
Set!

24
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,014
Snap it! Snap it! Snap it!

25
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,392
Come on!

26
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,561
Hut!

27
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,239
Strong side! He's open!

28
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,783
He's open! Throw!

29
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,758
<i>And that'll be it for the Herd.</i>

30
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,304
That's right, the clock has hit all zeroes...

31
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,557
<i>...and the Carolina faithful</i>
<i>are already on their feet.</i>

32
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,933
<i>So there you have it.</i>

33
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,894
- <i>It's all over, folks.</i>
- Good game, Red.

34
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,565
<i>Marshall loses a tough one,</i>
<i>17-14 to the East Carolina Pirates.</i>

35
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,567
Red's got his work cut out for him.

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,946
Well, there goes my weekend.
Red'll be in the film room till Monday.

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,448
He'd better.

38
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,409
Your husband hasn't figured out
how to beat the 3-4 all year.

39
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,912
<i>Co-captain Nate Ruffin</i>
<i>and cornerback Tom Bogdan...</i>

40
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:09,624
<i>...are two of four starters who were</i>
<i>left back in Huntington due to injuries.</i>

41
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,669
Surprised to see you. Figured the chairman
of the school board would be at the game.

42
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,047
This place won't run itself,
you know that.

43
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,966
- Furnace ready for the tap?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>The next week is a must-win.</i>

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,474
They're all must-wins, Gene.

46
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,728
<i>No word yet on whether any or all of the</i>
<i>injured players will be available next--</i>

47
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,819
Hey, Sandy, can I get
some more foil in here?

48
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>The score, 17-14, East Carolina Pirates.</i>
<i>Quarterback Teddy Shoebridge...</i>

49
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,576
I got it!

50
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:54,335
Hey, where's the flag?
Where's the flag? Flag on--

51
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,005
Fifty-five! Blocking in the--

52
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,092
--if that confusion on the Marshall sideline
at the end of the game...

53
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,221
...won't make that target on
Coach Tolley's back a little bit bigger.

54
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,225
I'm not gonna ask you guys again.
Dinner's ready.

55
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,645
That means you too, Keith.

56
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,606
Please, just a few more seconds?
Dad's not off yet.

57
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,943
He'll still be droning on about that game
when he gets home tonight.

58
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,195
Get out from under there,
Keith Morehouse.

59
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:25,867
I'm Gene Morehouse saying
good night, and go Herd!

60
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,451
Fellas...

61
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,414
...you gave a good effort out there today.

62
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,210
But let me be clear about this:

63
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,089
A good effort is not enough.

64
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,720
Now, I'm proud of you.

65
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,141
But I will not accept losing with you.

66
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,060
Because there's only one thing
they judge us on.

67
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,980
There's only one thing people remember.

68
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,692
And it ain't how we play the game!

69
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,364
Winning...

70
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,034
...is everything.

71
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,372
Plane leaves in an hour.

72
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,209
We'll be home by 8.

73
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,546
Plenty of time for y'all to do whatever
the hell y'all do on a Saturday night.

74
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,304
Now, see, Bogdan, the reason we lost
is because we weren't there.

75
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,308
Chocolate Thunder, White Lightning? We the
best defensive players in the conference.

76
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,851
I'm Chocolate Thunder, right?

77
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,729
Why you so scared to introduce me
to your girlfriend, then?

78
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,940
Listen, stop being so
overconfident, Ruffin.

79
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,860
All right, Rock, Paper, Scissors for tickets.
Let's go, right now.

80
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,572
It's okay. I'll get the popcorn.

81
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,449
East Carolina?

82
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,452
I mean, I can understand giving up
300 yards to Bowling Green.

83
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,954
But East Carolina?

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,123
Well, you can't do nothing
about injuries, you know?

85
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,709
What happened? Is it broken?

86
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,795
It's dislocated.

87
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,964
What's wrong with you, Tom?

88
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,842
Come on, man. Gonna miss the previews.

89
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:10,221
Nineteen carries, 108 yards, Paul,
your boy Chris played a hell of a game.

90
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,849
I'd have taken the win any day.
Isn't that right, Don?

91
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,059
What, now, we didn't win?

92
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,397
You of all people, Don.
If you're not gonna listen to the game...

93
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,149
...you gotta know the result
so you can pretend you did.

94
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,527
- Well, I'm doing my best, Paul.
- You hungry?

95
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,654
No, thank you. I'm all set.

96
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,657
Lloyd? Usual for me tonight,
just more of it. I'm starving.

97
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,868
- You got it.
- Go ahead, excuse me.

98
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,037
Well, the board has asked me
to run a few ideas through you...

99
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:39,292
...about some potential improvements
to the university's physical plant.

100
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,345
There's Chris!

101
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,186
What took you so long to call?
Tell Joe he can't run it to the inside...

102
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,980
Slow down, Reggie. Just listen.

103
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,942
- I just need a favor, not your life story.
- What you need?

104
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,989
I need you to go get us a case
of Falls City Beer. Falls City.

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,743
- Go to the liquor store on Fourth. Yeah.
- <i>Fourth Street?</i>

106
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,537
- Hey, are the guys with you?
- Yeah, Reggie.

107
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,706
What is it, godd--?

108
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,793
That's right, Reggie. You carry the two
and you divide by the sum...

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,464
Yeah, math class is over.
Let's get on the plane. Come on.

110
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,053
- I'll see you in a couple of hours, right?
- You know you are.

111
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,347
- I'm gonna stay at my dad's house tonight.
- No.

112
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,225
He's gonna wanna go over his
post-game breakdown.

113
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,019
Sorry. We've been doing it
since I was a kid.

114
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,355
You gonna tell him about California, right?

115
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,359
Are you kidding? After a loss?
We want him in a good mood.

116
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,110
Yeah.

117
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,155
Don't worry. I will.

118
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,159
Just not this weekend.

119
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,453
Griffen! Let's go!

120
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,414
I love you, Chris Griffen.

121
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,501
Come on, Annie!

122
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,839
- Race you back.
- Let's go! Hurry up!

123
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,924
I'm coming!

124
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,265
What's this concert you're missing?

125
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,435
It's just my granddaughter's piano recital.
Man, she sure is cute when she does that.

126
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,397
That's the crap I missed
first time around with my boys.

127
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,982
Now they got kids of their own.

128
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,235
Anyway, got a long ride ahead of me.
Have a great flight.

129
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,988
Hutch, tell you what,
I'll do the recruiting trip.

130
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,617
You go home and see your granddaughter's
recital. I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it.

131
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,747
- Thanks, Red. All right.
- I'll see you on Monday morning.

132
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,459
Good man, Red.

133
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,671
You can grab me a beer back home.

134
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>Because if he keeps on pulling</i>
<i>and no money comes out...</i>

135
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,352
- Good evening.
- <i>Doris.</i>

136
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,439
It's Red Dawson, calling from Greenville.

137
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,359
Could I trouble you to look and see
if Carole's home next door?

138
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,614
Sure doesn't look like it, Red.

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,658
Could you do me a big favor
and leave her a message for me?

140
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,204
Tell her that I gotta drive to Virginia
tonight on a recruiting trip...

141
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,372
<i>...and I'm not gonna be home</i>
<i>till tomorrow.</i>

142
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,708
- Got it.
- <i>All right, you have a good night, now.</i>

143
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,419
- All right, bye.
- <i>Night, Red.</i>

144
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,565
- You thinking about that girlfriend of yours?
- Yeah, coach.

145
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,693
Nice job, son.

146
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,821
Hey, that was a big hit today. Big hit.

147
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,074
I would've caught that pass
if I had my cross.

148
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,492
What'd you do with it?

149
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,120
You would've caught it if you had good
hands. Ain't that right, Shoebridge?

150
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:08,167
Hey, Gene, this is gonna sound a little
weird, but I need you to do me a favor.

151
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,546
Want you to scratch my back.
That target on there is starting to itch.

152
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,048
You can't believe everything
you hear on the radio.

153
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,092
Oh, yeah, I can.

154
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:24,350
All right, boys, let's sit up straight.
Tighten those ties, fix those collars.

155
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,435
- We are?
- Marshall!

156
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,729
Almost home.

157
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,442
<i>This is Captain Dettro speaking.</i>

158
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,279
<i>Looks like we made good time</i>
<i>in spite of the weather...</i>

159
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:41,242
<i>...so if everyone could return to their</i>
<i>seats now, we'll be landing shortly.</i>

160
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,523
Fill her up for you?

161
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,150
Yes, sir.

162
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,616
These peanuts look good.

163
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,203
I'll get a bunch of them too.

164
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,497
Sure. They're just 50 cents.
Help yourself.

165
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,667
Regular's on the left,
Cajun's on the right.

166
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,086
<i>Incredibly, there has been</i>
<i>another plane crash...</i>

167
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,963
How spicy are these Cajun...?

168
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,383
<i>--in moderate rain and fog</i>
<i>in West Virginia.</i>

169
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,302
What did he just say?

170
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,304
- Wait. Turn that up.
- No, what happened--

171
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,722
What did that say?

172
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,476
<i>Early reports do not indicate</i>
<i>the condition of those aboard.</i>

173
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,442
Excuse me, everybody...

174
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,027
<i>Annette said you look funny</i>
<i>when you're getting dressed.</i>

175
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,701
Bye, Carole.
Say hello to your husband for me.

176
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,704
- This is Lloyd.
- See you, Lloyd!

177
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,172
What's happened?

178
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,436
Hey!

179
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,859
- Hey, you going to the airport?
- Yeah, get in.

180
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,904
All right. I'm getting in. Hold on.
All right, good.

181
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,134
- Hey, did they say anything?
- Hey, come on!

182
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,762
No one's going in there.
I can't let you up there.

183
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,973
- Get that truck up the hill!
- Come on!

184
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,558
Hey, Randy!

185
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,103
Come on, keep going, come on.

186
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,443
Hey, watch the hose!

187
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,583
Got the president of the university here!

188
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,420
Oh, my God in heaven.

189
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,548
Oh, my God.

190
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,597
Come on.

191
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,850
Let's go.

192
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,188
- Hey, get behind the ropes!
- Just tell us the name of the airline!

193
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,733
- If I knew anything, I'd tell you!
- Just look at the front of the plane!

194
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,945
Son, there is no
front of the plane anymore.

195
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,908
Bring another hose down here!

196
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,827
No, stay back. Stay up there! No!

197
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,997
- Let's go!
- Nate! Nate Ruffin!

198
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,585
This our boys' plane?
This our boys' plane?!

199
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,677
It's so terrible.

200
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,269
You didn't get my message?

201
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,168
<i>Marshall University in West Virginia</i>
<i>is in a state of shock today...</i>

202
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,881
<i>...following the terrible tragedy of last</i>
<i>Saturday night's crash of a chartered airline.</i>

203
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,175
<i>Seventy-five people died in the wreckage.</i>

204
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,093
<i>The football team, the coaches...</i>

205
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,430
<i>...and some prominent residents</i>
<i>traveling with the team...</i>

206
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,671
<i>These were beautiful young men...</i>

207
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,052
<i>...and it's just a tragedy</i>
<i>that is beyond all comprehension.</i>

208
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,877
<i>No one of us will ever</i>
<i>enter this stadium...</i>

209
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,047
<i>...without thoughts of them.</i>

210
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:40,221
<i>And so, our Lord, grant them</i>
<i>eternal rest and peace...</i>

211
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,641
<i>...which enables them</i>
<i>at this very moment...</i>

212
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:49,397
<i>...to look upon us here</i>
<i>and smile and be with us.</i>

213
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:54,318
<i>This is our faith, this is our hope.</i>

214
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,071
<i>Amen.</i>

215
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>Those were not welcome days.</i>

216
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,774
<i>We buried sons...</i>

217
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,610
<i>...brothers...</i>

218
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,278
<i>...mothers...</i>

219
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,530
<i>...fathers...</i>

220
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,782
<i>...fiancés.</i>

221
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,669
<i>Clocks ticked, but time did not pass.</i>

222
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,514
<i>The sun rose and the sun set.</i>

223
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,684
<i>But the shadows remained.</i>

224
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,524
<i>When once there was sound...</i>

225
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,611
<i>...now there was silence.</i>

226
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,207
<i>What once was whole...</i>

227
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,627
<i>...now is shattered.</i>

228
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,867
Have you mentioned this
to any of the other board members?

229
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,996
A few. Most of them
would prefer not to think about it.

230
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,249
I can understand that sentiment.

231
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,128
It doesn't make sense to rush
right back into it, you know?

232
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,631
Our coaching staff, gone.
Our athletic department, gone.

233
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,968
So many of our boosters, gone.

234
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,679
We'd have to start
all over again from scratch.

235
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:31,058
My God, we don't have the resources
or the manpower right now.

236
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,187
I know all the reasons
to suspend the program, Paul.

237
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,480
I'm just surprised to hear it
coming from you.

238
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,816
This town just didn't lose
a football team, Don.

239
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,612
We lost doctors, lawyers,
city councilmen.

240
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,281
We lost fathers, sons, husbands.

241
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:50,453
How many kids lost a parent?
How many kids lost both parents?

242
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,290
- Twenty-eight.
- Wouldn't be a game anymore, Don.

243
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,752
Be a weekly reminder of what we've lost.

244
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,216
And I just don't see how that would
do anyone in this town any good.

245
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,720
Somebody's going to
have to tell them, Paul.

246
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,100
All your scholarships will still be honored.

247
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,564
Boys, it's very important that
we take a collective breath, as a town...

248
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,275
...and figure out the
proper course of action.

249
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,654
And you think the proper course of action
is ending the program?

250
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,242
I didn't say we were going to end the
program, I said we are going to suspend it.

251
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,830
Look, under the best of circumstances,
it takes years to build a team...

252
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,626
...and, well, these are not
the best of circumstances.

253
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,629
The NCAA will not let freshmen play...

254
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:45,258
...and they are the only players
we have besides you.

255
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,304
When we do bring the program back, we
want to make sure we're able to do it right.

256
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,307
If. That's what you mean, right?

257
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,309
If they bring the program back?

258
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,316
This ain't right, Dr. Dedmon.
It ain't fair!

259
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,111
I understand your position, son.

260
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,323
I will personally pass on your concerns to
the board before they make their decision.

261
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,325
Why can't I pass on
my concerns myself?

262
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,247
Well, unfortunately, board of governors'
meetings are and always have been...

263
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,665
...closed-door.

264
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,171
Come on!

265
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,214
Everybody up! Let's go. Come on.

266
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,508
Reggie, put down the stick. Come on.

267
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,343
I need y'all to listen.

268
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:34,390
Now, as of 15 minutes ago,
we ain't got football no more.

269
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,437
If you gonna be Marshall,
you gonna be Marshall right now.

270
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,190
Earn your stripes.

271
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,237
Now, I want the two of you
to go with Randy...

272
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,532
...and get every cheerleader and every girl
you can possibly find...

273
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:55,411
...and get them here at 5:00. The two
of y'all, I need you to go with George...

274
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:59,081
...and find every cat in them frat houses
and get them here at 5:00.

275
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,917
Go, now, go!

276
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,668
I need you on this one, Reggie.

277
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,338
I need you, man.

278
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,716
Find every person y'all met
in freshman orientation...

279
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,385
...and I need them here at 5:00.

280
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,805
All right? Come on! Now! Come on!

281
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,016
- Five o'clock!
- Nate.

282
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,227
- Yeah.
- Come here a sec.

283
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,606
Hey, I heard that some
of the guys are wavering.

284
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,109
- Wavering?
- Yeah, they're just kind of...

285
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:31,656
No, no, no. What you mean? What you
talking about? Who's wavering, Tom?

286
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,202
They don't feel it's the right thing to do
right now, step out on that field.

287
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,955
It's the only thing to do, Tom.

288
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,707
This about our teammates, man.

289
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,961
Now, I need to know
who you talking about.

290
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,257
No one, man.

291
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,677
Five o'clock. All right?

292
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,097
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

293
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,891
- You all right?
- Forget it.

294
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,894
I was just having some thoughts.
I'm ready, man. Let's go.

295
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,439
- We gonna get this team back, man.
- Yeah.

296
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,154
Okay, I think we all know
why we're here today.

297
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,365
What I'd like to do first...

298
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:24,792
Excuse me, young man.
Excuse me, this is a private meeting.

299
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,797
I don't mean to interrupt, sir, but I think
there's something y'all need to hear.

300
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:34,844
If you have anything to say, we'll set up
a time for you to come by my office.

301
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:39,599
Oh, no, sir. I ain't got nothing to say.

302
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,521
But they do.

303
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:28,898
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

304
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,651
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

305
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,529
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

306
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,240
We are Marshall!

307
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,659
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

308
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,203
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

309
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,164
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

310
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,542
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

311
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,211
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

312
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,381
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

313
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:56,259
We are Marshall!

314
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,678
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

315
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,222
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

316
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,850
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

317
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,769
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

318
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:09,063
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

319
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,816
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

320
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,610
Paul.

321
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,488
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

322
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,449
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

323
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,411
It's the right thing to do, sir.

324
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:33,337
Son, we do not have a team.
We do not have a staff.

325
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:38,968
We don't even have a damn
athletic director. May he rest in peace.

326
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:45,183
Frankly, son, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

327
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,769
Well, you can start with a coach, sir.

328
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:55,568
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

329
00:28:55,735 --> 00:29:01,449
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

330
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:07,246
<i>We are Marshall! We are Marshall!</i>

331
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,083
<i>We are Marshall!</i>

332
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,799
Hey, Mr. Boone.

333
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,345
Annie, honey, come here.

334
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,390
You don't have to come back
to work right away.

335
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,810
Take some time for yourself.
The job will be waiting when you get back.

336
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,772
One thing I don't need
is more time for myself.

337
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,275
I just want things to get back to normal.

338
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,783
Hi, Mr. Griffen.

339
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:48,204
It's good to see you.
Glad you're not giving up the booth.

340
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:52,667
I've been coming here every day
for 30 years. No reason to stop now.

341
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,979
I think you should have this back.

342
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,817
Chris gave it to you.

343
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,153
Yeah, he did.

344
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,241
But you gave it to your wife first.

345
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,620
And then you passed it down to him...

346
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,707
...so I'm passing it back up to you.

347
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,086
It should stay in your family.

348
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,465
What family?

349
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,095
Annie...

350
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,140
...you keep it.

351
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,853
Wear it. And every morning
you put it on, you think of him.

352
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,891
- Don.
- Red.

353
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,728
What are you working on there?

354
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:40,066
Well, I been promising Carole
a new shed for a while now, so...

355
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,652
No time like the present, I guess.

356
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,572
Red, I've got an offer for you.

357
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,288
I was afraid you might.

358
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,425
<i>Mrs. Dawson, if it had been me...</i>

359
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:10,137
...I don't even know how I'd make it out
of bed in the morning.

360
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,184
Let him build a hundred sheds.

361
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,608
<i>Hello, this is President Donald Dedmon.</i>

362
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:28,364
We've decided to go ahead
with our football program next season...

363
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:33,160
...and your name was the first
on a list of potential candidates...

364
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:37,290
...for the head coaching position.

365
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,170
Well, no, I completely
understand. I just...

366
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,131
You were the first one
on my list, so I...

367
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:54,557
No. No, we decided
to bring the program back.

368
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,144
Yes, it wasn't an easy decision.

369
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:01,981
No, that's totally understandable. I...

370
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:08,362
Well, thank you very much for...

371
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,991
...well, taking the time
to at least talk with me about it.

372
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,249
As I've been told,
you had a great career at Marshall and...

373
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:28,174
Yes, thank you.

374
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,845
No, I understand.

375
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,348
No, I...

376
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,517
Please, it's...

377
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,565
Hey, honey?

378
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,235
You ever been to Huntington before?

379
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,571
Mouth closed, Peter. Thank you.

380
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,198
West Virginia?

381
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,783
No.

382
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,618
Why?

383
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,037
Just curious.

384
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,207
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

385
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:08,005
Been quieter than I would've
guessed this morning.

386
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:11,008
Ernie Salvatore called from the <i>Herald</i>.

387
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,761
Says he wants to talk
if you have a moment.

388
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,888
Oh, and there was another call.

389
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:20,268
A Jack Lengyel called
from the College of Wooster.

390
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:24,814
Says he may be interested
in the open coaching job.

391
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,816
Wooster.

392
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,985
Where in the world is Wooster?

393
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,904
Does it really matter?

394
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,329
Okay, now, let's show Dr. Dedmon
how it's done here.

395
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:44,959
Run hard, knees high. Play till
the whistle blows. 17-Razor, on three.

396
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,462
On three, 17-Razor.
Hut, hut, hut. Go, go, go!

397
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,967
There he goes. There he goes.
Oh, first down!

398
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,970
- You see that? Oh, yeah.
- Is he all right?

399
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:59,182
Hey, 32, are you all right?
All right, go kill your brother.

400
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:02,393
Now, you see that? Point is,
that tree wouldn't have been there...

401
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,520
...if you had a fullback blocking for him.

402
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,481
And that is why I'm a fan
of the Power I Formation.

403
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,362
Well, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I haven't the
faintest idea what a Power I Formation is.

404
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,239
Oh, you don't?
Oh, thank you, dear.

405
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,408
- You're welcome.
- Power I Formation...

406
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:21,829
...is just your basic offensive scheme.
Put the fullback in front of the tailback.

407
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:25,166
Now, frankly, Jack, I don't care to know.

408
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:31,172
Actually, I'm confident that I'm better off
not knowing what one is, I think.

409
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:37,136
Well, Dr. Dedmon, on that,
we will have to agree to disagree.

410
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:38,888
Thank you.

411
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,061
Jack, there is one thing I need to know...

412
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,688
...and please excuse me if I seem blunt.

413
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:53,444
You are the first person I've interviewed
who is not an alumnus.

414
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:57,114
And, well, since you called us...

415
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:01,160
...I have to ask what your angle is, Jack.

416
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,666
You've got a great setup here.
You have no ties to Marshall.

417
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,544
Why do you want this job?

418
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,296
Who in their right mind
would volunteer for something...?

419
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:15,550
Son, don't put that in your mouth.
No, put it down. That's right.

420
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:19,178
- It's not an outrageous question, I think.
- What's he gonna do?

421
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,265
He's gonna put it in his pants?
I bet he puts it in his pants.

422
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,018
- Son, don't put that in your pant-- Sandy!
- I got it. Peter.

423
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,562
I'm sorry, excuse me.

424
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:32,942
Well, I was just wondering if you had
given this any thought at all...

425
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,987
...before you asked me to drive 200 miles
out here to see you.

426
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,073
A little bit, yeah.

427
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,117
Little bit.

428
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,291
Well, all right, then.

429
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,669
I have a long ride home...

430
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:54,505
...and I should be getting on with it.

431
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,383
You thank your wife for the lovely dinner.

432
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,719
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes, thank--

433
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,345
Thank you.

434
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,225
Say, Don?

435
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,606
You wanna know why
I picked up the phone? Is that it?

436
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,983
Frankly, I do.

437
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:18,738
- It's not gonna be complicated.
- Jack, I've had four months of complicated.

438
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,489
I just need honest.

439
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:38,758
When I heard about
what had happened, your situation...

440
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:44,764
...the only thing I could think about
was the four of them.

441
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,478
I thought about how much
they mean to me...

442
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,607
...and about how bad it would hurt if...

443
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,611
Well, if I was to lose them.

444
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,284
Then I thought about a team...

445
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,163
...and a school...

446
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,416
...and a town...

447
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,503
...that's gotta be hurting real bad.

448
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,174
And I thought, hell...

449
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,844
...maybe I can help.

450
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,893
So I called you.

451
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:36,941
Yeah.

452
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:42,405
I guess that's the only real "why" I got.
Right there.

453
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,032
Touchdown.

454
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,164
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

455
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,878
...please welcome the new head coach
of our Thundering Herd...

456
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,713
...Jack Lengyel.

457
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,389
Hi there.

458
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,525
Thank you.

459
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:29,660
I am honored to be the new head
football coach here at Marshall University.

460
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:36,375
Also would like to say a big thank you
from myself, my wife and our three kids.

461
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:40,296
We drove in from Wooster last night.
Arrived at our new home here.

462
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:43,841
Electricity worked,
the water pressure was high.

463
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:47,720
There was a six-pack of beer in the fridge
and a pound cake on the counter.

464
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,474
Four for four.
We appreciate the hospitality, we really do.

465
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,062
Any questions?

466
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:58,981
- Coach?
- Yes, sir.

467
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,234
Ernie Salvatore, <i>Herald-Dispatch</i>.

468
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,612
Now, realistically, coach,
what are your expectations for the season?

469
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,533
Well, I can tell you this...

470
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,744
...if it's a miracle you're looking for...

471
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,541
...well, you should keep looking, because
you're gonna end up disappointed...

472
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,709
...and I'm gonna end up out of a job.

473
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:22,129
Follow-up, coach. Follow-up.
One quick follow-up, coach.

474
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:25,091
What would you say to
the family members in the community...

475
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:30,471
...who feel that putting the team back
on that field might be disrespectful?

476
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:39,146
I am a football coach.

477
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:43,359
That is what I do
and that's why I'm here.

478
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,654
I guess that's it.

479
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:48,823
I have no idea.
What kind of answer was that?

480
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,157
How many clichés...?

481
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,452
Are there any other questions?

482
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,413
This guy won't make it.

483
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,001
So this is my varsity team, huh?

484
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,670
There was four of us...

485
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:08,968
...but one of us ain't here,
so I guess it's just three.

486
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,845
Okay.

487
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:14,765
I'm Coach Jack Lengyel, guys.

488
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,476
Normally, I'm bad with names,
so the good news is...

489
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:20,521
...I may actually be able
to keep you fellas straight.

490
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,940
Nate, is it?

491
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:26,360
Okay, now, hold on
while I commit this to memory. Nate.

492
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,821
As in Nate the Great.

493
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,741
Date, late, escape. Wait. Nate.

494
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,701
McDrake.

495
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:38,206
I got it. Locked.
Kid I went to grade school with.

496
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:41,834
See, that's a little word-association trick
I learned. Helps jog the recall.

497
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:45,213
I read about it in <i>Redbook</i>.
And I tell you what, it really works, too.

498
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:49,050
Well, we're in this together now, boys.

499
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,970
I'm not going anywhere,
and that's a promise.

500
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,056
Already got one name down.

501
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,601
Soon as the wife gets things
settled at the house...

502
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:02,230
...y'all are coming over for supper,
and I'll get the other two.

503
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:06,192
We are Marshall.

504
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:10,863
It's a new day, men.

505
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:15,743
I like those boys, Don. I do. I do.

506
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,371
The thing is, I'm gonna need
55 more just like them.

507
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:21,499
Oh, that I can't help you with, I'm afraid.

508
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:23,835
Well, actually, you can, Don.

509
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:29,549
You see, I need you to petition
the NCAA for me.

510
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:34,345
Ask them to make an exception.
Allow us to play freshmen.

511
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:37,557
Now, it's the only chance we have
to get any edge on recruiting...

512
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:40,434
...much less put a full football team
on the field.

513
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,854
I mean, we are way behind here.

514
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,191
Well, you know the NCAA
better than I do, Jack.

515
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,112
They're rigid as a board.
They don't make exceptions.

516
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:53,948
Usually true.

517
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:56,117
Yeah.

518
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:02,415
Hey, you know, my son, he crapped
his pants yesterday. Now, he's 4.

519
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:05,960
All right, now, my wife is out shopping,
so I had to clean him up.

520
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:09,213
She got home. I told her what happened.
She says, "I can't believe it."

521
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,133
I said, "I can't believe it either.
The kid's 4 years old...

522
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:14,594
...he shouldn't be doing that shit."
Pun intended.

523
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,555
You know what she says to me?
She says, "Jack, no, not that.

524
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:21,601
I can't believe you finally
changed a diaper."

525
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:25,479
What are you talking about?

526
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:28,608
There's a first time for everything.

527
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:33,738
Hey, I know you.

528
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:36,199
In the middle. Yes, I do.

529
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:40,119
Ask me your name. Go ahead,
I won't even look. Ask me your name.

530
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:44,332
- What's my name?
- Nate Ruffin.

531
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,127
Team co-captain. Eleven interceptions
in only seven games last year.

532
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:52,465
<i>Redbook.</i>

533
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,467
Stuff really works.

534
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:56,844
Hey, we can do this, doc.

535
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:07,480
What are those, 1 -by-5s?

536
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:08,856
One-by-sixes.

537
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:13,402
They don't look that wide from down here.

538
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:20,034
- Saw you guys play once.
- Did we win?

539
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:22,995
It was the Ashland game.

540
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:24,705
Well, that'd be a no, then.

541
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:29,001
Well, you guys looked pretty good
till the fourth quarter.

542
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:32,380
Probably should've gone to the nickel.

543
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:36,509
You know, you're probably right.

544
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:39,178
You know, I appreciate you
coming out here to see me...

545
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:43,975
...but they already came out here to ask me
back and I already told them that I'm not...

546
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:48,563
- ...coming back, so...
- Yeah, I heard. I heard about that.

547
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:54,068
Just thought I could make you
a better offer.

548
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:57,321
You know, they asked you
to be the head coach.

549
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,157
I want you to be the assistant coach.

550
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,245
I think that's a demotion, Jack.

551
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,955
Well, maybe.

552
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,874
Maybe not.

553
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,253
I mean, it's the same duties,
practically, just less pay.

554
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:16,716
Same hours. Less responsibility.

555
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,010
Same team, less pressure.

556
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:25,266
I tell you, Red, you know,
the cupboard is pretty bare.

557
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:29,562
And I could use some recruiting help
from someone who knows the area.

558
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:39,447
You know, Carole and I
moved here two years ago. It was...

559
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:42,909
...spring of '69.

560
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:47,121
They had hired me as a receivers coach...

561
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:51,083
...but when I got here, they told me
I was in charge of recruiting too, so...

562
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:56,631
That first year I went out
and I got us 20 kids.

563
00:45:57,256 --> 00:46:01,928
Went to 20 homes.
Sat in 20 living rooms.

564
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,891
And I promised 20 mothers
that I'd look after their sons.

565
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,437
It'd have been the class of '73.

566
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,944
There's not one of them left.

567
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:24,075
So let me ask you, Jack:

568
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:29,956
How am I supposed to look a mother in the
eye and promise her anything ever again?

569
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,297
I don't know, Red.

570
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:49,600
I just don't think I could
take that field again, Jack.

571
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:05,032
Is that the Ohio Valley Coal line?

572
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:08,119
The same one that went off the tracks
near Akron last winter?

573
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:11,330
Yep. That's the one.

574
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:14,083
Back on track.

575
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:23,009
Well, listen,
if you're able to figure it out...

576
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:25,970
...door's always open.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Red.

577
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:28,097
Nice meeting you.

578
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:32,143
I'll keep that defensive-nickel
package idea in mind...

579
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:36,522
...for my fourth quarters in the future.
Maybe get a few more W's.

580
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:39,901
One-by-six, huh?

581
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:41,319
Yup.

582
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:44,864
Same coverage, less boards.

583
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:50,411
Hey, Tom.

584
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,082
Guess we got us a coach, huh?

585
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:05,885
Hey, look.

586
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:11,682
When they first roomed us together
freshman year, I wasn't too sure about you.

587
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,938
You know? But we stuck it out,
and now you're my best friend.

588
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,608
I mean, remember freshman two-a-days?

589
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:24,695
I'm puking my guts out and
I wanna quit football and you won't let me?

590
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:28,741
Now, you never gave up on us
out there on the field...

591
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:31,410
...and I'm not gonna give up on you now.

592
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:37,041
Tom, man.

593
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:42,964
It's our team. Now, they left this to us.
It's up to us! It's on our shoulders, man.

594
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,801
I need you with me, Tom.

595
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,220
I should've been with them, Nate.

596
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:53,599
- Look, Tom, I understand, and I feel--
- No, you don't! You don't, Nate! You don't.

597
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,145
What you talking about?

598
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:02,316
I overslept.

599
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:06,279
That's why I wasn't on the plane, Nate.
I overslept.

600
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:09,824
I wasn't hurt or sick.
And I should've been there.

601
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:11,993
I should have been with them!

602
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:17,832
I'm sorry. I just can't play football
right now. Okay? It's not in me.

603
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:23,588
I can't do it, you understand that, right?
Look at me.

604
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:28,009
I'm sorry.

605
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,011
Tom.

606
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:50,323
Thought you might like some dessert.

607
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:53,701
Thank you, Annie.

608
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,537
I'm gonna get you some silverware.

609
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:00,309
Yup.

610
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,603
Game day.

611
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:10,278
Yup.

612
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:24,625
So I'll give you one year.

613
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,590
Well, if that's all the time we've got,
we'd better get started.

614
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:45,104
Coach Mickey Jackson.

615
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,525
Coach McNally.

616
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,614
Coach Riley.

617
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:03,122
First line: NCAA, address--
I assume you have it, Luann.

618
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,416
It's somewhere in Kansas City.

619
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:09,504
Salutation: To whom it may concern.

620
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:13,799
As I am sure you are aware, we...

621
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,220
I'm gonna take a road trip
southeast of here...

622
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:20,932
...and go get this Shaw kid
down in Martinsville.

623
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:23,100
I'm gonna take a shot at Gibbs.

624
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:25,520
Go get us a quarterback, coach.

625
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:43,287
- Jake. Red Dawson.
- Yes, sir?

626
00:52:51,337 --> 00:52:54,715
I know coaches from quite a few schools
have already come to talk...

627
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:58,845
...about your son playing football for them.
I hope that he hasn't made his mind up.

628
00:52:59,011 --> 00:53:00,847
Ain't no way he's made up his mind yet.

629
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:04,016
Wait, there he is, right there.

630
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:17,488
Oh, what's the good word, coach?

631
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:22,326
No? Shit.

632
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,373
Truman Andrews. Here we come.

633
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,399
Shit.

634
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:56,444
Luann?

635
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:01,365
Sir?

636
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:04,202
Has the NCAA returned
any of my calls yet?

637
00:54:04,368 --> 00:54:05,786
No.

638
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:11,250
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
11 at West Virginia.

639
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:15,880
Kids that we wanted who are now
in West Virginia. Who's that?

640
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:18,799
Bob Lambert. West Virginia.

641
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:20,468
Shit.

642
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:22,094
Twelve. West Virginia.

643
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:25,431
Red, we gotta broaden our
recruiting base or something.

644
00:54:25,598 --> 00:54:28,935
We gotta get creative about...

645
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:32,063
...who we're going after,
where we're going after them...

646
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,441
...and how we're going after them.
Isn't that right, doc?

647
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:38,986
Good morning, Red.

648
00:54:40,404 --> 00:54:43,157
Well, how are we doing?

649
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,326
West Virginia will be
competitive next year.

650
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,870
Yeah, very.
How about you?

651
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:54,836
Well, Jack, I haven't heard anything
positive back yet.

652
00:54:55,002 --> 00:54:57,463
And I think I've done everything I can.

653
00:54:57,797 --> 00:55:01,133
Maybe we need more time.
I don't know.

654
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:05,179
Time's the only thing
we don't have, Don.

655
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:11,811
I mean, hell, it's already April.
Time is not our friend.

656
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:17,942
Let me ask you a question.
Now, are you married?

657
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,861
Yes, I am. 25 years in May.

658
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:23,281
Twenty-five years. I am willing to bet...

659
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:27,577
...that you didn't propose over the phone.

660
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:31,956
No, I didn't.

661
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:37,795
Okay. And I know damn well
that she didn't say yes in a letter.

662
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:42,341
- Jack?
- Doc?

663
00:55:42,508 --> 00:55:45,928
- No, Jack. I know...
- Yes. Doc?

664
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:47,346
You can do it.

665
00:55:49,473 --> 00:55:51,517
You're an outlaw. Pioneer.

666
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:55,396
Gunslinger.
This is a whole new game, doc.

667
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,984
You...

668
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:02,028
You.

669
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:06,073
There's a first time for everything, Don.

670
00:56:07,617 --> 00:56:10,244
If we're gonna survive, this has
to be one of those times.

671
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:12,914
And you're the only man that can do it.

672
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:29,388
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me,
I'm sorry to bother you like this...

673
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:34,435
...but my name is Don Dedmon,
I'm president of Marshall University.

674
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:37,230
May I speak with you
for a moment, please?

675
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:40,650
What are you doing in Kansas City, Don?

676
00:56:41,275 --> 00:56:45,655
My town, my school, we're hurting.

677
00:56:46,155 --> 00:56:51,118
We want to play football,
and we cannot do it without your help.

678
00:56:55,998 --> 00:56:57,542
Please.

679
00:57:17,436 --> 00:57:19,605
Guess who's going to change our diaper.

680
00:57:22,316 --> 00:57:25,444
Yeah!

681
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:27,071
Get him!

682
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:29,907
Need a little help here, Red.
He's heavier than you think.

683
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:32,577
He's all wet.
He's all wet.

684
00:57:33,578 --> 00:57:35,079
Approved.

685
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:39,250
"You will be allowed to play freshmen
at Marshall University."

686
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:42,128
- What's that right there? What's that?
- Here, put me down.

687
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:45,590
That is signed by the president right there.
There he is. Stamped.

688
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:48,301
Doc, we're gonna get us a football team.

689
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:52,138
And that is why we are offering
your son something...

690
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:54,682
...that no other school in the country can.

691
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:59,854
Immediate and substantial playing time
as a freshman.

692
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:17,997
Time! I like the kid
who made the lay-up.

693
00:58:18,164 --> 00:58:21,626
This is the one I wanna talk to, right here.
What's your name, son?

694
00:58:26,255 --> 00:58:28,216
Ball, ball, ball!

695
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:34,889
- That was a hell of a hit.
- Thank you.

696
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:37,475
- Coach Dawson, from the football club.
- Bobby Jordan.

697
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:39,894
- Ever play any football? None at all?
- No, sir.

698
00:58:40,102 --> 00:58:43,105
- No Pop Warner, no high school?
- No. Just baseball.

699
00:58:47,944 --> 00:58:49,862
Groovy. Come on, man.

700
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:51,697
Hey, let me rap to you.

701
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,333
Hey, how you doing?

702
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:07,755
Hey. What's up, man?

703
00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:25,481
Strong finish.
That's a good-looking board.

704
00:59:26,816 --> 00:59:30,695
Good-looking board.
I'm tired of flying.

705
00:59:33,364 --> 00:59:38,286
Marshall Thundering Herd all-freshmen
team, led by quarterback John Cady...

706
00:59:39,996 --> 00:59:44,792
...handing the ball off
to the ever-talented Lucas Booth!

707
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:47,670
He runs to the inside,
and who's on the outsider wing?

708
00:59:47,837 --> 00:59:50,631
Terry Gardner catches it,
pitches to Tennis Rice...

709
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,302
...who's going downfield to
tight end Sam Boteck.

710
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:21,996
I've never been.

711
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:23,664
- Crazy. In four years?
- Yeah.

712
01:00:23,831 --> 01:00:25,208
- The bonfire.
- I've never been.

713
01:00:25,374 --> 01:00:27,376
- Everyone's been to the bonfire.
- I haven't.

714
01:00:27,543 --> 01:00:29,879
- Do you eat marshmallows?
- I love marshmallows.

715
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:33,841
- You've gotta come to the bonfire.
- Annie, order's up.

716
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:37,178
- Ask her to come.
- I will, I will.

717
01:00:41,516 --> 01:00:43,476
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

718
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:47,855
- Can we have some silverware?
- Sure.

719
01:00:53,486 --> 01:00:56,072
- Some guys have all the luck.
- Sorry?

720
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:58,824
Your fiancé. He's a lucky guy.

721
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,830
- Can you drive? Yeah.
- Yeah. We'll leave about 8?

722
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:16,843
Keith? It's your turn
to set the table!

723
01:01:17,009 --> 01:01:18,719
He's not here, Mom.

724
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,556
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

725
01:01:23,432 --> 01:01:25,560
Okay, guys. First things first.

726
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:27,979
Feel a connection to the guy next to you.

727
01:01:28,145 --> 01:01:31,107
Hand on a knee, hook an arm,
whatever it is.

728
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:33,150
Come on, Herd.

729
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:35,903
Look around, because these
are your teammates, young men.

730
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:39,073
They're made up of three
returning varsity members.

731
01:01:39,282 --> 01:01:42,910
Randy Linden, George Olson, Nate Ruffin.

732
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:47,039
Fifteen freshmen turning sophomores.

733
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:49,834
And the rest of you, true freshmen...

734
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:53,629
...very first time in college football
and walk-ons.

735
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:56,174
Are you gonna play too, Tom?

736
01:01:57,383 --> 01:02:00,970
Remember, this is a game called football,
let's get to work. Let's go.

737
01:02:13,065 --> 01:02:15,443
We are going to be running
the Power I, gentlemen...

738
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:17,737
...which obviously starts
with a quarterback.

739
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:20,740
- Red, what are my choices?
- Dave Walsh.

740
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:23,743
Solid athlete. Solid arm. Solid kid.

741
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,369
Okay.

742
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,622
Who else?

743
01:02:27,788 --> 01:02:32,418
- Jack, that's it.
- That's it, 10?

744
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:33,794
That's it, coach.

745
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:36,214
All right, guys.
Competition breeds improvement.

746
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:40,092
Now, we need options here.
Let's look around, keep our eyes open.

747
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,430
We need legs, hands and a decent arm.
Right there. Who's 86?

748
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:48,267
That's Reggie Oliver.
Receiver from Alabama.

749
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:51,229
Bear Bryant called me personally,
actually, to recommend him.

750
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:54,649
- You wanna try him out at QB?
- Unless you think it's a bad idea.

751
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:57,985
- Let's push them to the limit, men, huh?
- Right, coach.

752
01:03:04,575 --> 01:03:06,494
Come on, hit it, now!

753
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,455
Check!

754
01:03:18,172 --> 01:03:19,298
Not good, coach.

755
01:03:34,313 --> 01:03:36,482
James, James. Get over here.

756
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:40,194
That's supposed to be a post route.

757
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:42,113
- Post?
- Post.

758
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,324
You do know the difference between a
post route and a flag route?

759
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:46,701
No, coach.

760
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:50,329
All right, all right.
You see the big goalpost there?

761
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:54,250
That's why they call it a post route. Post.
You head right to that post.

762
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,127
Cut 10 yards, to the post.

763
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:58,754
See the big pylon down
at the corner of the end zone?

764
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:00,715
That's what we call a flag, all right?

765
01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:02,717
So when you're running the flag route...

766
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:05,428
...10 yards to the corner of the end zone,
to the flag.

767
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:07,430
- All right? All right.
- I got it.

768
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:09,307
Do it again.

769
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:22,236
Come on! Let's go!

770
01:04:22,778 --> 01:04:25,448
Nice speed, Booth! Nice speed!

771
01:04:27,116 --> 01:04:29,577
Nice speed. Shalhoop. Hey.

772
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:32,830
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I kick the ball, coach.

773
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:35,791
But after you kick it, son,
you're still a football player.

774
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:45,051
Good job, George. Good job, George.
Come here, come here.

775
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:47,094
- What's your name, 51?
- My name's Creole.

776
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:49,263
Creole. This <i>Redbook</i>'s
taking me only so far.

777
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:53,476
Urbanek, I need names. Last names on
everyone's helmet. All right? This afternoon.

778
01:04:53,643 --> 01:04:57,605
Now, Creole, the man outweighs you
by 75 pounds. Okay?

779
01:04:57,772 --> 01:04:59,398
When you're hitting him up high...

780
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:02,568
...he'll beat you and you'll be
on your ass every time, all right?

781
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,946
You gotta come in here,
you gotta get him low.

782
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:08,574
Get him in the legs, okay? That's how
you'll keep him from coming through.

783
01:05:08,741 --> 01:05:11,536
- Stay low on him. Low, man.
- What should I do if he goes low?

784
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:14,372
Good question. George says,
what does he do if he goes low?

785
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:16,958
Five-one comes low.
Head slap and you're around him.

786
01:05:17,124 --> 01:05:19,794
Like that. You see that?
Head-slap the shit out of him.

787
01:05:30,763 --> 01:05:34,809
- Give me second team, McNally.
- We don't have a second team, Jack.

788
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:38,771
Shit. Okay, yeah, we do
have a second team. Jackson! Urbanek!

789
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:40,940
Lengyel, McNally, Dawson...

790
01:05:41,107 --> 01:05:43,276
...line up here.
Offensive line, watch this.

791
01:05:43,442 --> 01:05:46,654
- Coach, you don't have any pads on.
- Now, you just play ball, Olson.

792
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:50,157
Quarterback's still standing.

793
01:05:50,324 --> 01:05:52,451
Big on big.
We can run an offense.

794
01:05:52,618 --> 01:05:56,831
We can save a young man's life.
Come on, now. Power I. Big on big.

795
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:05,173
We got a huge problem
on the O-line, coach.

796
01:06:06,215 --> 01:06:09,177
I don't think it's because
the defensive line is so spectacular.

797
01:06:09,343 --> 01:06:10,678
No. No.

798
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:16,809
Men. Power I. You know I'm a fan
of it, that's why I brought it here.

799
01:06:16,976 --> 01:06:19,812
I have learned in the last two weeks
that it is not working.

800
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:23,566
So as of right now, the Power I
goes in the trash...

801
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:28,070
...along with every flea-flicker,
double reverse...

802
01:06:28,237 --> 01:06:31,240
...and every other trick play
that you may have in your playbook.

803
01:06:31,407 --> 01:06:34,827
Get rid of it.
Men, it is time to simplify. Ball.

804
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:38,331
So put our heads together here.

805
01:06:38,497 --> 01:06:40,666
What is the simplest offense...

806
01:06:42,752 --> 01:06:45,546
...that you have ever run
and actually won a football game?

807
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:50,051
Any idea's a good idea. No right or wrong
in here today, men, let's talk it out.

808
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:51,594
Well, there's always the Veer.

809
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,640
The Veer. That's interesting.
Talk that out, Red.

810
01:06:56,224 --> 01:07:00,311
Well, the Veer's an option offense.
Spreads things out.

811
01:07:00,478 --> 01:07:02,063
Takes the focus off any one man.

812
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:05,191
It's designed for teams that don't
have a strong offensive line.

813
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,111
Now, that is us in a nutshell.
Well, who runs it that we can talk to?

814
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:11,697
Bill Yeoman came up with it
at Houston...

815
01:07:11,864 --> 01:07:15,201
...but other than West Virginia,
no one really runs it outside of Texas.

816
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:19,830
- West Virginia runs the Veer?
- Yeah.

817
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:29,423
Jack, that's crazy. We're rivals.

818
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:32,718
You think they'll invite us to lunch
and hand over their playbook?

819
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:34,762
They don't have to take us out to lunch.

820
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:37,014
We'll pick some up on the way.

821
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,686
Morgantown. The Veer. I like it.

822
01:07:46,023 --> 01:07:49,277
Eight-time Southern
Conference Champions, Red.

823
01:07:49,443 --> 01:07:53,698
Jack? Jack, I gotta tell you,
I really don't think this is your best idea.

824
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:57,326
- Red! Good to see you again.
- Oh, coach.

825
01:07:57,493 --> 01:07:59,662
- How are you?
- How are you?

826
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:01,914
- And this must be?
- Coach Jack Lengyel.

827
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:04,458
Jack. Bobby Bowden.
Pleasure to meet you.

828
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,294
It's a pleasure to meet you.

829
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,796
Bobby, thank you for taking
the time with us today.

830
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:11,340
- My pleasure, not a problem.
- All right.

831
01:08:11,507 --> 01:08:13,092
Yes, sir.

832
01:08:13,593 --> 01:08:16,971
So I can't wait to hear.
What can I do for you boys?

833
01:08:18,639 --> 01:08:20,516
Well, the thing is...

834
01:08:21,559 --> 01:08:22,977
...coach...

835
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:27,481
...we're thinking about adopting
the Veer this year.

836
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:30,776
Now, I understand that to be
your bread and butter, as it were.

837
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:33,654
We're just hoping that we could
come down here and maybe...

838
01:08:33,821 --> 01:08:35,823
...you could give us a few pointers.

839
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,123
- Pointers?
- Tips.

840
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:48,044
Advice. Anything that you'd
be willing to show us.

841
01:08:48,377 --> 01:08:53,591
Well, we'd really appreciate it. You seem
to be the man who runs it so well.

842
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,595
He's good.

843
01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:02,642
- You're the best at the Veer.
- That's what they say!

844
01:09:02,808 --> 01:09:04,727
I'm coming straight to the man.

845
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:11,359
Reg, I got your burger.

846
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:14,237
- Chili on the fries?
- They were out.

847
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:18,407
Come on, Stretch. Gonna be a rough year
if that's the best you can do.

848
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,837
What?

849
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:14,589
Playbooks. Research. Game film.

850
01:10:14,755 --> 01:10:17,550
Need anything copied or dubbed,
just see Kitty down the hall.

851
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:20,219
Coach, you serious?

852
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:24,015
Sure. We don't play y'all this year,
so, what the heck? Have at it.

853
01:10:24,182 --> 01:10:26,934
Just make sure you put everything back
where you found it.

854
01:10:27,101 --> 01:10:28,686
Deal.

855
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:32,315
You grow them big down in Huntington,
I'm telling you.

856
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:37,904
Oh, guys. You get hungry,
there's a lunch spread next door.

857
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,864
Help yourselves.

858
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:45,328
You hungry, Red?
I'm gonna watch some film.

859
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:11,437
Let me see those things.

860
01:11:14,857 --> 01:11:17,109
I'm you. I'm you.

861
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:21,572
Well, that's not dumb.

862
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:26,369
Their quarterback's gotta
have ice in his veins...

863
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:30,581
...but he's gotta still be able to make
decisions until the last possible second.

864
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:44,345
Give me that ball!
Give me the ball! He scores! Go, Herd!

865
01:12:05,616 --> 01:12:09,287
Oh, look at that hit.
Every time he commits.

866
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:12,290
He gets the option to get the ball outside.
Hey, guys.

867
01:12:13,499 --> 01:12:15,418
Sorry. We're looking for coach.

868
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:16,919
Not in here today, guys.

869
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:19,297
Sorry, coach, we just came
to watch some film.

870
01:12:23,634 --> 01:12:25,761
You told us to meet with you
after practice.

871
01:12:29,223 --> 01:12:31,517
- Next one.
- Yes, sir.

872
01:12:38,524 --> 01:12:40,651
Colors clash a bit, don't they?

873
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:44,363
That's first class, coach.

874
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:46,782
First class.

875
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:49,452
You guys take all the time you need.

876
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:16,562
Your offense, 12.
Show me how it's done, now.

877
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:20,608
Black-18! Set! Hut!

878
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,238
Move! That's it!

879
01:13:25,404 --> 01:13:28,866
That's it, go! Move! Go! Move!
Go! Move!

880
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:37,375
Coach Red Dawson, looks a little something
like the Veer, doesn't it?

881
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:39,710
Little bit. Little bit.

882
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:41,212
I like it.

883
01:13:42,463 --> 01:13:44,549
One more time.
Go to your right side.

884
01:13:45,174 --> 01:13:46,634
They don't look half-bad, coach.

885
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:49,512
Don't look half-bad left or right, Ernie.
Did you see that?

886
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,223
I did. I was playing around
with the numbers last night.

887
01:13:52,431 --> 01:13:55,643
You know the average age of a starter
in college football these days?

888
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:58,396
- No idea. Go!
- 20 years, 10 months.

889
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:00,857
Now, you know the average age
of your players?

890
01:14:01,023 --> 01:14:04,318
- No.
- 18 years, seven months.

891
01:14:06,028 --> 01:14:10,950
That'd be us, Ernie.
The Young Thundering Herd. I like it.

892
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:13,286
Oh, I like that.
Do you mind if I use that?

893
01:14:13,452 --> 01:14:15,454
Hell, no. I'm already making T-shirts.

894
01:14:17,123 --> 01:14:19,250
What you think about this?

895
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:22,044
"The Young Thundering Herd."

896
01:14:22,628 --> 01:14:25,423
I like it, George!
Can you get me one of those?

897
01:14:32,263 --> 01:14:33,764
We've practiced.

898
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:40,104
We have a plan.

899
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,193
And now it's game day.

900
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,865
Nate Ruffin,
are you the captain of this team?

901
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:52,325
Yes, sir, I am, coach!

902
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:55,620
Well, why don't you take us
onto that field?

903
01:14:57,163 --> 01:14:59,373
Everybody up! Come in here!

904
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:04,879
Now, 60 minutes! We play till the whistle
blow! And you know how we do.

905
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:06,589
- We are?
- Marshall!

906
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:09,175
- Now, let's take it to the field!
- Yeah!

907
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:17,183
<i>And here they come,</i>
<i>the Young Thundering Herd of Marshall!</i>

908
01:15:25,858 --> 01:15:28,236
Jack! Jack!

909
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:31,948
Game day.

910
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:40,206
<i>Welcome to Morehead, Kentucky,</i>
<i>where the Morehead State Eagles...</i>

911
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:44,252
<i>...take on the Thundering Herd of Marshall</i>
<i>University in their 1971 season opener.</i>

912
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:47,797
<i>The Marshall Thundering Herd</i>
<i>was marked by tragedy last season...</i>

913
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:51,008
<i>...but they are back in the saddle</i>
<i>with a new coach, a new team...</i>

914
01:15:51,175 --> 01:15:54,720
<i>...and for the first time in NCAA history,</i>
<i>true freshmen in their lineup.</i>

915
01:15:54,887 --> 01:15:59,267
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen, the</i>
<i>Morehead State Eagles are taking the field.</i>

916
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:06,649
- How you feeling?
- Feeling good, coach.

917
01:16:06,816 --> 01:16:08,276
Feeling good.

918
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:15,324
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

919
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:41,267
Oh, no.

920
01:16:49,483 --> 01:16:53,946
That's a clip! Where's the clip on that?
That's a clip, ref!

921
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:08,836
It's all right. It's all right.

922
01:17:11,672 --> 01:17:14,050
They hit him low. All right?

923
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:17,512
They hit him low. All right?

924
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:21,432
I'm all right. I'm all right.

925
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:23,601
<i>We hope he didn't re-injure his shoulder...</i>

926
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:26,437
<i>...but I could hear the hit</i>
<i>from up here in the press box.</i>

927
01:17:26,646 --> 01:17:28,981
<i>Number 25, Nate Ruffin,</i>
<i>got blindsided and...</i>

928
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:33,444
<i>--could not stop the return man.</i>

929
01:17:33,653 --> 01:17:37,323
<i>And now, with the extra point,</i>
<i>Morehead State is leading 29-6.</i>

930
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:40,117
<i>The Marshall faithful</i>
<i>cannot be happy now.</i>

931
01:17:41,827 --> 01:17:44,455
Oliver! Oliver! Strong right!

932
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:48,793
Switch! Switch!

933
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:52,588
Forty! Set! Hike!

934
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:03,307
Damn it.

935
01:18:05,393 --> 01:18:07,395
That's a shame.

936
01:18:11,607 --> 01:18:13,609
Gotta look him off.
If you look him off...

937
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:16,821
And you don't have to throw it.
You had 20 yards in front of you.

938
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:18,573
Hut!

939
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:25,121
- Ball! Ball!
- Get on the ball!

940
01:18:30,209 --> 01:18:32,378
That ain't a pitch,
you gotta get me the ball.

941
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:35,381
- If I make the pitch, catch the ball.
- You gotta get it to me.

942
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:38,968
We gotta shake it up here.
We gotta start blitzing our linebacker.

943
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:00,072
<i>That's a hard hit on number 29. Twenty-nine</i>
<i>is down and he's not getting up.</i>

944
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,117
<i>I don't see number 29 on my roster here.</i>

945
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:06,996
<i>There's just so many new faces on this</i>
<i>Marshall University Thundering Herd team.</i>

946
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,540
Can you shake it off or not?

947
01:19:10,082 --> 01:19:12,543
Dawson! Dawson!

948
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:17,798
What do you think?
We gotta get three points.

949
01:19:17,965 --> 01:19:20,635
We don't get any points on the board,
we'll lose them.

950
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:23,596
All right, we need our three.
It's gonna help out the morale.

951
01:19:23,763 --> 01:19:27,225
Send the kicking team in. Let's go.
Gotta end this game with three points.

952
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:29,977
Yeah. Send them in.
Kicking team, let's go.

953
01:19:43,449 --> 01:19:45,743
Dawson. Send them in!

954
01:19:48,829 --> 01:19:50,581
Call it in, Red!

955
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,751
Call it in!

956
01:19:57,463 --> 01:19:59,257
Send them in!

957
01:20:01,467 --> 01:20:02,927
Kick it! Kick it!

958
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:05,763
Field-goal unit! Let's go!

959
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:16,107
Let's go!

960
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:40,047
<i>These kids do have plenty of heart,</i>
<i>but just not enough skill or experience...</i>

961
01:20:40,214 --> 01:20:42,675
<i>...to compete at this level.</i>
<i>And with this loss...</i>

962
01:20:42,842 --> 01:20:46,554
<i>...next week's first home game against</i>
<i>Xavier University won't be any easier.</i>

963
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:50,349
<i>The Xavier game will be the first</i>
<i>home game since the devastating crash...</i>

964
01:20:50,516 --> 01:20:53,477
<i>...that killed 75 players and fans.</i>

965
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:57,481
<i>After this painful loss,</i>
<i>the Marshall faithful must be wondering...</i>

966
01:20:57,648 --> 01:20:59,942
<i>...if they've done the right thing.</i>

967
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:19,837
Pick it up.

968
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:22,173
Pick what up?
Pick my jersey up?

969
01:21:22,381 --> 01:21:25,176
It ain't your jersey, it's Joe Hood's jersey.
Now, pick it up.

970
01:21:25,384 --> 01:21:27,094
- Who's Joe Hood?
- You don't know him.

971
01:21:27,261 --> 01:21:29,847
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Now, pick it up!

972
01:21:31,182 --> 01:21:37,313
Look, man, I came here to play ball, and I'm
gonna be as respectful as I can be...

973
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,484
...but I'm the one playing
for this team now. I'm number 33.

974
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:44,529
That's my jersey.
I'll do whatever I want with it!

975
01:21:47,114 --> 01:21:50,034
Hey, break it up! Break it up!
Listen to me, break it up right--

976
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:00,711
Well, Meckstroth's ankle's just a sprain,
so he should be better by Saturday.

977
01:22:00,878 --> 01:22:03,756
And Meadows' hamstring, it's okay too.

978
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:07,051
What about Ruffin's shoulder?
What'd the doc say?

979
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:11,681
Well, it ain't good.
I think we better sit him, Jack.

980
01:22:12,765 --> 01:22:14,517
Well, he's not gonna like that.

981
01:22:14,684 --> 01:22:18,020
Well, he ain't gonna like trying
to write with the other hand, either...

982
01:22:18,187 --> 01:22:20,565
...and that's what he's looking at
if he keeps going.

983
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:24,402
Okay, well, let's see what he can do
in practice. Thank you.

984
01:22:25,611 --> 01:22:29,073
Split right, 434-Z-Slant.
Let it develop and trust it.

985
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,700
Trust it. Make the play. Go.

986
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:32,118
Here he comes, D!

987
01:22:36,831 --> 01:22:38,791
Forty-two! Set, hut!

988
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,637
What's your problem?
We're on the same team!

989
01:22:57,852 --> 01:22:59,979
Make them commit.
Make it so. Make it so.

990
01:23:06,277 --> 01:23:07,278
Set, hut!

991
01:23:15,828 --> 01:23:17,955
Hey! Break it up! Break it up now!

992
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,252
I can't take that!
Man, you want some of me?

993
01:23:23,419 --> 01:23:25,171
Get back there!

994
01:23:28,883 --> 01:23:30,635
Get back in the huddle!

995
01:23:39,435 --> 01:23:41,646
All right, let's go.

996
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:49,487
Fourteen! Set, hut!

997
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:57,912
That's it. Walsh, did you see that?
That's success!

998
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:06,045
Ruffin!

999
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:09,799
Ruffin! What the hell
is the matter with you?

1000
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:12,218
Just playing till the whistle blew, coach.

1001
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:13,678
Bullshit!

1002
01:24:14,387 --> 01:24:17,306
You think you're the only one
who has a right to be pissed off?

1003
01:24:17,473 --> 01:24:19,892
You think you're the only one
that's had it rough?

1004
01:24:53,593 --> 01:24:57,471
Ruffin, get up. Get up, Ruffin.
That's enough.

1005
01:24:57,638 --> 01:24:59,307
Go water down.

1006
01:25:00,391 --> 01:25:02,393
- Oliver, you okay?
- Yeah.

1007
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:07,064
Where are you going?

1008
01:25:09,525 --> 01:25:11,485
What the hell are we
doing out there, Jack?

1009
01:25:11,652 --> 01:25:14,697
We're trying to run a Veer.
We're trying to get ready for Xavier.

1010
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:16,240
Really?

1011
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:20,578
Feels a lot more
like Bloody Knuckles to me.

1012
01:25:20,745 --> 01:25:24,248
I mean, it feels like we're just
punching walls out there, Jack.

1013
01:25:25,249 --> 01:25:27,752
I mean, we're not actually helping them.

1014
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:31,547
We're bringing the worst out in them.
Shit, we're bringing the worst out in me.

1015
01:25:32,965 --> 01:25:34,425
And for what?

1016
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:38,971
So that we can collect pity applause
in front of every college in the conference?

1017
01:25:42,683 --> 01:25:44,894
You didn't know Rick Tolley.

1018
01:25:45,394 --> 01:25:46,604
I did.

1019
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:50,566
And on the day that he died, he said...

1020
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:55,446
...the only thing that they judge us on,
the only thing that counts, is winning.

1021
01:25:55,613 --> 01:25:57,156
Nothing else matters.

1022
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:01,160
So, what do we do?
How are we honoring their memory?

1023
01:26:01,327 --> 01:26:06,082
We put together a team
that doesn't win. Can't win.

1024
01:26:06,249 --> 01:26:11,796
Not this week, not this season.
Hell, maybe not ever.

1025
01:26:13,422 --> 01:26:16,175
We're not honoring them, Jack.

1026
01:26:18,469 --> 01:26:20,346
We're disgracing them.

1027
01:26:25,518 --> 01:26:27,103
I'm done.

1028
01:26:38,948 --> 01:26:41,158
Don't bench me, coach.

1029
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:47,707
- Jesus, Nate, have you even slept?
- Not now.

1030
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:51,711
Not before our first home game.

1031
01:26:51,878 --> 01:26:55,423
Now, look, Nate, your shoulder
is in bad shape.

1032
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,425
The rest is gonna do it some good.

1033
01:26:57,592 --> 01:27:01,137
No. No, it ain't.
The rest ain't gonna do it good.

1034
01:27:01,304 --> 01:27:04,807
Nate, I'm not questioning your courage
or your drive, okay?

1035
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:08,186
- My shoulder's fine.
- This shoulder?

1036
01:27:08,352 --> 01:27:10,605
It's ready to take the field?
It's ready for hits?

1037
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:12,190
- My shoulder's fine.
- Yes or no?

1038
01:27:12,356 --> 01:27:14,192
- My shoulder's fine. Yeah.
- This one?

1039
01:27:14,358 --> 01:27:16,569
- Can it take hits like that?
- My shoulder's fine.

1040
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,279
Gonna be a lot harder than that.

1041
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,990
My shoulder's fine.

1042
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,502
Talk to me.

1043
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:34,837
Oh, coach.

1044
01:27:38,841 --> 01:27:42,178
That was my team.

1045
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:50,478
They left it in my hands.

1046
01:27:54,273 --> 01:27:58,110
Oh, Nate.
No, no, no, they did not.

1047
01:27:58,277 --> 01:28:00,029
No.

1048
01:28:00,196 --> 01:28:02,240
They just left.

1049
01:28:03,574 --> 01:28:05,535
Then why?

1050
01:28:09,872 --> 01:28:11,958
Why, coach?

1051
01:28:14,126 --> 01:28:15,837
Why?

1052
01:28:19,423 --> 01:28:20,633
I don't know.

1053
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:58,504
The board voted you out this morning.

1054
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:01,924
What? May I ask why?

1055
01:29:02,091 --> 01:29:07,346
Come on, Don.
You were always a temporary solution.

1056
01:29:07,513 --> 01:29:10,016
You said it yourself after Roland resigned.

1057
01:29:10,183 --> 01:29:13,019
You were just a Band-Aid, remember?

1058
01:29:13,644 --> 01:29:16,731
Is this about the football program, Paul?

1059
01:29:18,316 --> 01:29:20,818
The crash just cut too damn deep, Don.

1060
01:29:20,985 --> 01:29:24,780
It's not just the team that's bleeding.
It's not just the school.

1061
01:29:24,947 --> 01:29:26,365
It's the entire town.

1062
01:29:26,532 --> 01:29:29,118
Do you have any idea
what it's like for Annie right now?

1063
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:32,205
She can't read the paper.
She can't watch the news.

1064
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:36,125
She can't even go to work
without being reminded of football...

1065
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:41,172
...which reminds her of the crash,
which reminds her of my dead son!

1066
01:29:44,383 --> 01:29:46,177
Paul.

1067
01:29:46,344 --> 01:29:48,804
This isn't about football, is it?

1068
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:54,435
And this isn't about Annie.
And this isn't about the town, Paul.

1069
01:29:54,602 --> 01:29:59,148
This is about the loss of your son.
And I'm sorry.

1070
01:29:59,357 --> 01:30:03,152
But until you find the strength
to deal with that pain...

1071
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:06,322
...nothing's going to get any better.

1072
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:10,243
No matter how many presidents
you fire, Paul.

1073
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:33,182
Just about closed. Sorry.

1074
01:30:35,059 --> 01:30:39,814
My wife tells me you've got
the best apple pie in Huntington.

1075
01:30:41,065 --> 01:30:43,067
Depends on the apple.

1076
01:30:44,485 --> 01:30:46,904
Well, do you mind if I try?

1077
01:30:48,781 --> 01:30:50,491
Hey, Annie.

1078
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:01,169
- Annie Cantrell?
- Yeah.

1079
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:05,506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1080
01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:17,059
Mr. Griffen?

1081
01:31:17,977 --> 01:31:21,063
I don't believe we've been
formally introduced yet.

1082
01:31:21,272 --> 01:31:23,149
I'm Jack Lengyel.

1083
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:27,570
Thank you.

1084
01:31:34,076 --> 01:31:37,580
I understand Don Dedmon
lost his job this week.

1085
01:31:37,747 --> 01:31:41,250
He's well-qualified, he'll find a place.

1086
01:31:45,213 --> 01:31:49,467
You know, if you have a problem
with anything that happens on the field...

1087
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:52,637
...blame me, not him. I'm the coach here.

1088
01:31:52,803 --> 01:31:56,182
And what happens out there
is my responsibility, not his.

1089
01:31:56,349 --> 01:31:58,893
You're not from here,
you weren't here last November...

1090
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,812
...so I don't expect you
to understand this.

1091
01:32:03,356 --> 01:32:05,441
This is not about what happened
on that field.

1092
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:08,486
This is about what happened
to this town.

1093
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:10,404
This is not a game.

1094
01:32:29,006 --> 01:32:32,969
I'm real sorry about your son,
Mr. Griffen.

1095
01:32:34,762 --> 01:32:37,473
He was a hell of a running back.
I bet you were real proud.

1096
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,851
Please don't talk about him
like you knew him.

1097
01:32:42,228 --> 01:32:44,438
I was proud of him,
and I'm still proud of him.

1098
01:34:37,426 --> 01:34:38,845
He was right, you know.

1099
01:34:42,557 --> 01:34:46,018
- Who was right?
- Your boy Tolley.

1100
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:50,398
Winning is everything
and nothing else matters.

1101
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:54,235
I mean, I've said that
so many times myself...

1102
01:34:54,402 --> 01:34:57,947
...I've lost count. You know?

1103
01:34:58,114 --> 01:35:01,492
And it doesn't matter in what sport,
and it doesn't matter what country...

1104
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:06,622
...any coach who's worth a darn
in this business believes those words.

1105
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,583
Fact.

1106
01:35:12,503 --> 01:35:14,463
And then I came here.

1107
01:35:16,841 --> 01:35:18,301
For the first time in my life...

1108
01:35:18,467 --> 01:35:22,138
...hell, maybe for the first time
in the history of sports...

1109
01:35:22,305 --> 01:35:25,641
...suddenly, it's just not true anymore.

1110
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,062
At least not here, not now. No.

1111
01:35:32,565 --> 01:35:34,233
You see...

1112
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:38,029
...Red, it doesn't matter if we win
or if we lose.

1113
01:35:38,196 --> 01:35:40,364
It's not even about
how we play the game.

1114
01:35:40,531 --> 01:35:44,785
What matters is that we play the game.

1115
01:35:45,286 --> 01:35:48,331
That we take the field,
that we suit up on Saturdays...

1116
01:35:48,497 --> 01:35:51,167
...and we keep this program alive.

1117
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:54,921
We play the game, Red,
and I'm telling you, one day...

1118
01:35:55,087 --> 01:35:57,673
...not today, not tomorrow,
not this season...

1119
01:35:57,882 --> 01:36:02,970
...probably not next season either,
but one day, you and I are gonna wake up...

1120
01:36:03,137 --> 01:36:07,099
...and suddenly we're gonna be like
every other team in every other sport...

1121
01:36:07,266 --> 01:36:11,604
...where winning is everything
and nothing else matters.

1122
01:36:14,023 --> 01:36:16,400
And when that day comes...

1123
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:24,992
...well, that's when we'll honor them.

1124
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:33,417
We've got a team meeting
tomorrow morning, Red.

1125
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:36,671
Got a little field trip planned
for the boys...

1126
01:36:39,757 --> 01:36:42,009
...and, well, we'd love
to see you there, coach.

1127
01:36:45,555 --> 01:36:47,557
We'd love to see you there.

1128
01:37:06,117 --> 01:37:09,203
Seven on the goal line. Tough on...

1129
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:11,372
Secondary C five through eight.

1130
01:37:11,539 --> 01:37:15,334
D can prevent kicking game onside
and kickoff.

1131
01:37:15,501 --> 01:37:17,253
Game day.

1132
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,132
Yes, it is.

1133
01:37:26,762 --> 01:37:29,265
I left your ticket on the kitchen counter.

1134
01:37:29,432 --> 01:37:33,477
I would appreciate it if you could make it
to the game before halftime.

1135
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:40,067
One time. I missed kickoff one time
and you'll never let me forget it.

1136
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:42,236
No, no, no, I won't.

1137
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:45,323
Because if I don't see you
in the stands, honey...

1138
01:37:45,489 --> 01:37:49,952
...I don't know, I get all out of whack,
you know?

1139
01:37:50,828 --> 01:37:54,749
- I'll be there.
- I know you will.

1140
01:37:57,543 --> 01:37:59,545
How big a crowd do you think you'll get?

1141
01:37:59,712 --> 01:38:03,174
- Well, after last week, I don't know.
- Yeah.

1142
01:38:04,759 --> 01:38:06,219
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

1143
01:38:06,385 --> 01:38:08,721
I'll race you to the "newpacer."

1144
01:38:10,264 --> 01:38:13,684
- The what?
- Newspaper.

1145
01:38:13,851 --> 01:38:15,353
- When, right now?
- Yeah.

1146
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,106
I don't know. Maybe!

1147
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:21,317
Get him! Run!

1148
01:38:22,693 --> 01:38:25,279
Hey, hey, hey--

1149
01:38:27,865 --> 01:38:29,700
Hey, coach!

1150
01:38:31,827 --> 01:38:34,914
- Lengyel!
- Win, Coach Lengyel!

1151
01:38:41,379 --> 01:38:43,464
- What day is it, son?
- Game day.

1152
01:38:43,631 --> 01:38:45,049
- What day?
- Game day!

1153
01:38:45,216 --> 01:38:48,010
Time to play until the whistle blows.

1154
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,807
- See you on the field.
- See you there!

1155
01:38:57,061 --> 01:38:59,021
Hi, Mr. Griffen.

1156
01:39:00,898 --> 01:39:03,901
Does nobody eat in this town anymore?

1157
01:39:04,068 --> 01:39:06,195
Not today, anyway.

1158
01:39:07,613 --> 01:39:09,073
You should go.

1159
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:12,118
Oh, no, my shift ends in a few hours.
It's no big deal.

1160
01:39:12,285 --> 01:39:14,328
That's not what I meant.

1161
01:39:16,414 --> 01:39:18,040
Come on.

1162
01:39:18,583 --> 01:39:20,585
Let's take a walk.

1163
01:39:20,751 --> 01:39:23,671
I don't think your customers will mind.

1164
01:39:25,423 --> 01:39:28,134
Do you know I was baptized
right here in the Ohio?

1165
01:39:28,301 --> 01:39:31,387
Swam in it all the time when I was a kid.

1166
01:39:31,762 --> 01:39:33,181
When I was away at the war...

1167
01:39:34,557 --> 01:39:38,186
...I'd fall asleep at night
to the sound of this water.

1168
01:39:38,603 --> 01:39:43,941
When my wife died,
I'd lay awake to the same sound.

1169
01:39:45,401 --> 01:39:48,362
Whenever I see this river,
I know I'm home.

1170
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:53,284
This is my home, Annie.

1171
01:39:55,745 --> 01:39:58,122
You were going to California
with my son.

1172
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:04,086
- How long have you known?
- I'm his father, I've always known.

1173
01:40:05,171 --> 01:40:07,465
You should go, Annie.

1174
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,304
Things have changed now.

1175
01:40:14,138 --> 01:40:17,350
I mean, I have responsibilities,
I have a job.

1176
01:40:19,143 --> 01:40:20,895
And you.

1177
01:40:22,104 --> 01:40:25,358
- You're all alone. I can't--
- Oh, stop, stop. You can't put that on me.

1178
01:40:25,525 --> 01:40:27,610
You've gotta go out there
and live your life.

1179
01:40:28,069 --> 01:40:31,197
If you don't leave now, you never will.

1180
01:40:33,407 --> 01:40:36,410
You're all out of excuses, Annie.

1181
01:40:37,036 --> 01:40:39,497
You can't stay for me
and you can't stay for your job.

1182
01:40:39,664 --> 01:40:40,998
Why not?

1183
01:40:41,165 --> 01:40:44,293
Because when I tell your boss
you left that restaurant unattended...

1184
01:40:44,502 --> 01:40:46,087
...he's gonna have to fire you.

1185
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:54,971
Grief is messy, Annie.

1186
01:40:55,513 --> 01:40:59,767
Makes you do things you regret,
sometimes things you'll always regret.

1187
01:40:59,934 --> 01:41:01,519
I don't. I don't regret it.

1188
01:41:02,019 --> 01:41:05,064
- I don't.
- I'm not talking about you.

1189
01:41:07,024 --> 01:41:10,152
Go, Annie. Go.

1190
01:41:56,574 --> 01:41:59,452
For those of you who may not know...

1191
01:42:00,244 --> 01:42:03,664
...this is the final resting place
for six members...

1192
01:42:03,831 --> 01:42:07,126
...of the 1970 Thundering Herd.

1193
01:42:08,336 --> 01:42:14,008
The plane crash that took their lives
was so severe, so absolute...

1194
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:17,345
...that their bodies were unable
to be identified.

1195
01:42:17,803 --> 01:42:21,682
So they were buried here, together.

1196
01:42:23,184 --> 01:42:25,144
Six players...

1197
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:27,605
...six teammates...

1198
01:42:27,772 --> 01:42:30,775
...six sons of Marshall.

1199
01:42:32,735 --> 01:42:35,696
This is our past, gentlemen.

1200
01:42:40,076 --> 01:42:43,079
This is where we have been.
This is how we got here.

1201
01:42:43,287 --> 01:42:45,414
This is who we are...

1202
01:42:45,831 --> 01:42:47,625
...today.

1203
01:42:50,086 --> 01:42:52,880
I wanna talk about our opponent
this afternoon.

1204
01:42:53,798 --> 01:42:56,759
They're bigger, faster, stronger,
more experienced...

1205
01:42:56,968 --> 01:42:59,804
...and on paper, they're just better.

1206
01:42:59,971 --> 01:43:02,014
And they know it, too.

1207
01:43:04,475 --> 01:43:07,144
But I wanna tell you something
that they don't know.

1208
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:10,773
They don't know your heart.

1209
01:43:12,733 --> 01:43:17,154
I do. I've seen it.
You have shown it to me.

1210
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:20,783
You have shown this coaching staff,
your teammates.

1211
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:25,746
You have shown yourselves
just exactly who you are in here.

1212
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,377
Now, when you take that field today...

1213
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:35,673
...you've gotta lay
that heart on the line, men.

1214
01:43:36,174 --> 01:43:40,136
From the soles of your feet, with every
ounce of blood you've got in your body...

1215
01:43:40,303 --> 01:43:42,805
...lay it on the line
until the final whistle blows.

1216
01:43:43,014 --> 01:43:44,974
And if you do that...

1217
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:49,228
...if you do that...

1218
01:43:51,522 --> 01:43:52,940
...we cannot lose.

1219
01:43:54,192 --> 01:43:57,320
We may be behind on the scoreboard
at the end of the game...

1220
01:43:57,486 --> 01:44:02,241
...but if you play like that,
we cannot be defeated.

1221
01:44:02,408 --> 01:44:04,702
Now, we came here today to remember...

1222
01:44:06,078 --> 01:44:08,039
...six young men...

1223
01:44:09,415 --> 01:44:11,709
...and 69 others...

1224
01:44:13,544 --> 01:44:17,465
...who will not be on the field
with you today.

1225
01:44:20,426 --> 01:44:22,678
But they will be watching.

1226
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:28,559
And you can bet your ass...

1227
01:44:28,726 --> 01:44:32,980
...that they'll be gritting their teeth
with every snap of that football.

1228
01:44:33,147 --> 01:44:36,859
You understand me?
How you play today...

1229
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,821
...from this moment on,
is how you...

1230
01:44:41,822 --> 01:44:44,742
...will be remembered.

1231
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:50,122
This is your opportunity
to rise from these ashes...

1232
01:44:50,289 --> 01:44:52,625
...and grab glory.

1233
01:44:57,046 --> 01:44:58,756
- We are--
- Marshall!

1234
01:44:58,923 --> 01:45:00,174
- We are--
- Marshall!

1235
01:45:00,341 --> 01:45:01,467
- We are--
- Marshall!

1236
01:45:01,634 --> 01:45:03,803
The funerals end today.

1237
01:45:12,019 --> 01:45:14,981
<i>Marshall! Marshall! Marshall!</i>

1238
01:45:20,778 --> 01:45:23,197
<i>Today, the Big Green is finally</i>
<i>back in Huntington...</i>

1239
01:45:23,364 --> 01:45:26,367
<i>...in front of a capacity crowd</i>
<i>here at Fairfield Stadium.</i>

1240
01:45:30,329 --> 01:45:33,291
<i>Number 19, Jake Crawford,</i>
<i>Xavier's all-American tailback...</i>

1241
01:45:33,457 --> 01:45:35,835
<i>...fields the ball and takes off downfield.</i>

1242
01:45:39,714 --> 01:45:44,302
<i>Crawford still untouched at the 30, the 35.</i>
<i>This kid's got speed, doesn't he?</i>

1243
01:45:44,468 --> 01:45:47,555
<i>He sure does. Just one man to beat.</i>

1244
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:50,850
- <i>It looks like Morehead State all over again.</i>
- Oh, gosh.

1245
01:45:51,851 --> 01:45:54,478
- <i>They come with a huge hit.</i>
- That's how you hit somebody!

1246
01:45:54,645 --> 01:45:56,480
Nice looping!

1247
01:45:58,482 --> 01:46:00,693
All right. All right,
tighten up, D, tighten up.

1248
01:46:05,239 --> 01:46:06,866
Good job, good job!

1249
01:46:08,534 --> 01:46:11,078
Nice lick. Nice save.

1250
01:46:11,245 --> 01:46:13,164
<i>Sophomore Reggie Oliver</i>
<i>takes the field...</i>

1251
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:15,666
<i>...and leads the offense</i>
<i>on their first possession.</i>

1252
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,168
Set, hut!

1253
01:46:21,672 --> 01:46:23,466
Hut!

1254
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:29,222
Punt! Punt. Punt team.

1255
01:46:34,227 --> 01:46:35,311
Come on, cover it!

1256
01:46:37,188 --> 01:46:38,856
<i>Just the punter to beat.</i>

1257
01:46:40,608 --> 01:46:44,529
- <i>The shoestring tackle by Bill Shalhoop!</i>
- That's playing till the whistle blows.

1258
01:46:44,695 --> 01:46:48,115
You kick it and you play defense.
Good job, Shalhoop.

1259
01:46:48,282 --> 01:46:50,785
All right, let's go. Let's get a stop.

1260
01:46:51,869 --> 01:46:54,455
<i>Crawford gets a step on Ruffin.</i>

1261
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:59,168
<i>And makes another catch</i>
<i>for another first down.</i>

1262
01:46:59,377 --> 01:47:03,130
<i>Boy, I'll tell you what, that hurt shoulder</i>
<i>sure looks like it's affecting Ruffin.</i>

1263
01:47:03,297 --> 01:47:07,134
- That kid knows he can't go to his right.
- He's playing to it. Keep an eye on that.

1264
01:47:09,887 --> 01:47:12,223
- Split six, cover one. Ready? Break!
- Break!

1265
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:15,434
<i>We've got a scoreless game,</i>
<i>and Xavier has great field position...</i>

1266
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:19,605
<i>...but they're in a race against the clock</i>
<i>with only 25 seconds till halftime.</i>

1267
01:47:19,772 --> 01:47:20,940
Hut!

1268
01:47:22,733 --> 01:47:24,110
- Right side!
- Make the hit!

1269
01:47:26,904 --> 01:47:28,489
<i>Ruffin with a giant hit.</i>

1270
01:47:28,656 --> 01:47:30,449
- Ball! Ball! Ball!
- <i>The ball is loose!</i>

1271
01:47:30,616 --> 01:47:32,326
Go, go, go!

1272
01:47:37,748 --> 01:47:41,085
- Nice hit. Nice ball.
- Nate, you all right?

1273
01:47:41,252 --> 01:47:42,920
- Can you get up, Nate?
- Hold on, 25.

1274
01:47:43,087 --> 01:47:45,214
I'm sitting him the second half,
no matter what.

1275
01:47:45,423 --> 01:47:48,092
- Let me tell him. Let me tell him.
- You got it, you got it.

1276
01:47:48,259 --> 01:47:50,386
Mickey Jackson!

1277
01:47:53,431 --> 01:47:54,765
Good. All right.

1278
01:47:54,932 --> 01:47:58,019
<i>There's enough time on the clock</i>
<i>for one last play before the half.</i>

1279
01:47:58,186 --> 01:47:59,770
Need a 37-yard field goal.

1280
01:47:59,937 --> 01:48:03,191
<i>Marshall's kicking game was spotty at best</i>
<i>last week against Morehead.</i>

1281
01:48:03,357 --> 01:48:04,400
Blake, come on!

1282
01:48:04,609 --> 01:48:07,361
<i>Let's see what Lengyel</i>
<i>decides to do here.</i>

1283
01:48:12,491 --> 01:48:14,535
We're kicking it.
Let's go, we're kicking it.

1284
01:48:14,702 --> 01:48:17,830
<i>This is an awfully long kick</i>
<i>for sophomore Blake Smith...</i>

1285
01:48:17,997 --> 01:48:20,791
<i>...a walk-on from Marshall's soccer team.</i>

1286
01:48:38,059 --> 01:48:39,810
<i>The kick is good!</i>

1287
01:48:41,521 --> 01:48:42,522
Hey!

1288
01:48:42,688 --> 01:48:44,732
- That's groovy, baby!
- That's groovy, baby.

1289
01:48:45,149 --> 01:48:47,527
<i>I don't believe it.</i>
<i>The Young Thundering Herd...</i>

1290
01:48:47,693 --> 01:48:50,154
<i>...has a 3-0 lead</i>
<i>as they take it into halftime.</i>

1291
01:48:50,321 --> 01:48:52,323
Hot damn,
he's liable to make that from 50.

1292
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:53,449
Good call.

1293
01:48:53,658 --> 01:48:55,910
<i>Stick around.</i>
<i>We've got a dogfight on our hands...</i>

1294
01:48:56,077 --> 01:48:59,539
<i>...as Xavier is certainly</i>
<i>a second-half team.</i>

1295
01:49:02,667 --> 01:49:06,921
- <i>We are--</i>
- <i>Marshall!</i>

1296
01:49:07,088 --> 01:49:10,883
- <i>We are--</i>
- <i>Marshall!</i>

1297
01:49:13,928 --> 01:49:16,764
Damn it, coach, I said I'm all right.

1298
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:23,312
Nate, you're sitting.

1299
01:49:30,027 --> 01:49:31,988
You can't do that, coach.
I gotta cover 19.

1300
01:49:32,154 --> 01:49:34,532
Nineteen's got six catches
for 95 yards, Nate...

1301
01:49:34,699 --> 01:49:37,243
...and it's because he knows
you can't go to your right.

1302
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:41,455
- We got two more quarters of football.
- Yes, we do. Yes, we do, Nate.

1303
01:49:42,164 --> 01:49:44,166
But you've done enough.

1304
01:49:44,917 --> 01:49:47,753
Coach, I've been going to my right
all day--

1305
01:49:48,963 --> 01:49:51,340
You see what's going on out there?

1306
01:49:55,386 --> 01:49:59,098
Nate, that's all because
you never stopped pushing.

1307
01:50:00,349 --> 01:50:03,895
- We got two more quarters of football.
- You've done enough, Nate.

1308
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:07,899
You've done enough.

1309
01:50:29,754 --> 01:50:32,089
Are we gonna be all right, coach?

1310
01:50:34,759 --> 01:50:37,595
Yeah. We're gonna be all right.

1311
01:50:38,763 --> 01:50:40,890
Yeah, we're gonna be all right.

1312
01:50:41,766 --> 01:50:43,851
<i>Thanks for joining us</i>
<i>back at halftime, folks.</i>

1313
01:50:44,018 --> 01:50:47,563
<i>You know what's hard to fathom?</i>
<i>It's hard to believe this is even possible...</i>

1314
01:50:47,772 --> 01:50:50,733
<i>...but Jack Lengyel</i>
<i>has the Marshall Young Thundering Herd...</i>

1315
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:53,986
<i>...a team of freshmen, of transfer students,</i>
<i>of walk-ons...</i>

1316
01:50:54,153 --> 01:50:56,405
<i>...a team of nobodies and no ones...</i>

1317
01:50:56,572 --> 01:51:00,826
<i>...somehow are beating the Xavier Pirates</i>
<i>after 30 minutes of football.</i>

1318
01:51:00,993 --> 01:51:04,121
<i>Well, that is true,</i>
<i>but I gotta believe that, at some point...</i>

1319
01:51:04,288 --> 01:51:06,791
<i>...speed, size and experience will prevail.</i>

1320
01:51:09,544 --> 01:51:11,504
Come on, Booth!

1321
01:51:18,803 --> 01:51:20,638
That's the way to start the second half!

1322
01:51:20,805 --> 01:51:24,642
<i>This Young Thundering Herd looks like</i>
<i>they're ready to play.</i>

1323
01:51:24,809 --> 01:51:27,353
- 44-X-Punch. Let's go.
- Break!

1324
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,981
Nineteen, set, hut!

1325
01:51:32,817 --> 01:51:34,318
- <i>Big hit on Oliver...</i>
- Ball!

1326
01:51:35,236 --> 01:51:39,031
<i>...who loses the ball. Xavier scoops it up.</i>

1327
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:40,199
Let's go!

1328
01:51:40,366 --> 01:51:41,868
<i>He's on the 30...</i>

1329
01:51:42,034 --> 01:51:43,494
<i>...the 20...</i>

1330
01:51:44,036 --> 01:51:46,497
<i>...touchdown, Xavier!</i>

1331
01:51:47,248 --> 01:51:50,293
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>Xavier takes the lead, 6-3.</i>

1332
01:51:50,501 --> 01:51:52,545
It's okay! Come on!

1333
01:51:52,712 --> 01:51:55,006
- You're still the captain of this team.
- Yes, sir.

1334
01:51:55,173 --> 01:51:57,925
I'm gonna need you to be that captain
from the sideline.

1335
01:51:58,092 --> 01:52:00,344
Set, hut!

1336
01:52:00,511 --> 01:52:02,597
- Yeah, baby, let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

1337
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:11,022
- Great call.
- All right?

1338
01:52:13,107 --> 01:52:15,109
Twenty-two!

1339
01:52:15,776 --> 01:52:17,361
All right. Yeah.

1340
01:52:19,530 --> 01:52:20,740
It's your team now.

1341
01:52:23,326 --> 01:52:24,869
Set, hut!

1342
01:52:27,538 --> 01:52:29,540
<i>Nice flag route by Bill James.</i>

1343
01:52:31,626 --> 01:52:34,420
<i>He's got one foot inbounds.</i>
<i>That's good for a first down.</i>

1344
01:52:34,587 --> 01:52:38,090
- Yeah! Come on!
- Thought you were a basketball player.

1345
01:52:40,593 --> 01:52:43,304
If he doesn't pass, give it to Wooch.
If he does, tuck it.

1346
01:52:43,471 --> 01:52:45,181
- Tuck it and go.
- It's up to you. Go.

1347
01:52:45,348 --> 01:52:48,518
<i>Oliver in with the play.</i>
<i>They're close, folks, very, very close.</i>

1348
01:52:48,684 --> 01:52:52,438
<i>Just four yards</i>
<i>from a Thundering Herd score.</i>

1349
01:52:54,232 --> 01:52:55,900
Come on, Reggie.

1350
01:53:21,968 --> 01:53:23,761
<i>Touchdown, Reggie Oliver!</i>

1351
01:53:24,428 --> 01:53:26,722
<i>And Marshall grabs the lead right back,</i>
<i>9-6...</i>

1352
01:53:26,889 --> 01:53:29,809
<i>...with eight seconds remaining</i>
<i>in the third quarter.</i>

1353
01:53:30,893 --> 01:53:32,770
Let's go!

1354
01:53:33,855 --> 01:53:37,066
That's what it looks like on paper
right there, doesn't it?

1355
01:53:47,368 --> 01:53:50,037
<i>If Marshall can hold on</i>
<i>for a little while longer, folks--</i>

1356
01:53:50,204 --> 01:53:52,331
<i>But there's a complete pass to Crawford!</i>

1357
01:53:52,498 --> 01:53:53,791
Go, go, go!

1358
01:53:56,878 --> 01:53:58,337
<i>He breaks free.</i>

1359
01:53:59,505 --> 01:54:01,591
<i>And he's in the end zone.</i>
<i>Touchdown, Xavier.</i>

1360
01:54:01,799 --> 01:54:05,678
<i>Oh, my. What a dagger to the heart</i>
<i>of this Marshall team.</i>

1361
01:54:06,762 --> 01:54:10,141
<i>And with the extra point, Xavier has</i>
<i>taken the lead back from Marshall...</i>

1362
01:54:10,308 --> 01:54:13,644
<i>...13-9 with one minute left to play.</i>

1363
01:54:18,024 --> 01:54:21,194
- <i>We are--</i>
- Let's go, Marshall! Come on!

1364
01:54:22,486 --> 01:54:24,614
<i>Marshall has time</i>
<i>for one last-ditch effort...</i>

1365
01:54:24,822 --> 01:54:27,992
<i>...but they'll have to march</i>
<i>all the way downfield into the end zone.</i>

1366
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:31,871
- <i>A field goal will not be enough.</i>
- Thirteen! Set, hut!

1367
01:54:37,126 --> 01:54:39,921
<i>Oliver breaks loose.</i>
<i>He's in the open field!</i>

1368
01:54:40,087 --> 01:54:42,340
Go, go, go!

1369
01:54:42,965 --> 01:54:45,468
<i>Something's happening here</i>
<i>for the Thundering Herd.</i>

1370
01:54:45,676 --> 01:54:48,429
Down, down, down! On the ball!

1371
01:54:48,596 --> 01:54:50,556
We got one time-out, coach.

1372
01:54:53,017 --> 01:54:57,355
- I-13! I-13!
- Run your offense. Run your offense.

1373
01:54:57,522 --> 01:54:58,898
Set, hut!

1374
01:54:59,065 --> 01:55:03,194
<i>Oliver holds the ball, rolls out,</i>
<i>and is sacked.</i>

1375
01:55:03,361 --> 01:55:05,530
<i>That's gonna be costly</i>
<i>as the clock keeps tick--</i>

1376
01:55:05,696 --> 01:55:08,282
<i>No, wait, he got rid of it!</i>
<i>He got rid of it!</i>

1377
01:55:12,286 --> 01:55:14,038
<i>A huge gain for the Herd!</i>

1378
01:55:14,205 --> 01:55:17,333
<i>Marshall marches upfield,</i>
<i>but with less than 30 seconds left...</i>

1379
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:21,212
- <i>...time is running out for the boys in green.</i>
- Time-out. Time-out.

1380
01:55:21,379 --> 01:55:23,714
<i>Marshall calls their last time-out.</i>

1381
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,301
Come on, Marshall!

1382
01:55:27,552 --> 01:55:31,347
Zero time-outs. We need a touchdown
to win. Here's the play:

1383
01:55:31,514 --> 01:55:36,102
Fire left, 422-Z-Rocket, all right?
Martin, Johnson or Linden.

1384
01:55:36,269 --> 01:55:40,273
After you catch the football,
if you cannot score, get out of bounds.

1385
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:43,276
If you do not get out of bounds,
everybody get to the line...

1386
01:55:43,442 --> 01:55:46,404
...Coach Red Dawson's got the winning play
coming in, all right?

1387
01:55:46,571 --> 01:55:48,114
There is no huddle from here out.

1388
01:55:48,281 --> 01:55:49,532
- Do you believe?
- Yes, sir!

1389
01:55:49,699 --> 01:55:50,867
- Do you believe?
- Yes, sir!

1390
01:55:51,075 --> 01:55:52,118
- We are--
- Marshall!

1391
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:54,996
<i>This is it, folks.</i>

1392
01:55:55,913 --> 01:55:57,123
Okay.

1393
01:56:03,129 --> 01:56:05,756
<i>Gotta get out of bounds</i>
<i>to stop the clock.</i>

1394
01:56:05,923 --> 01:56:08,301
- Get out of bounds!
- Get out, get out, get out!

1395
01:56:08,467 --> 01:56:12,430
<i>Clock is still ticking. He didn't make it!</i>
<i>He's still inbounds.</i>

1396
01:56:12,597 --> 01:56:16,684
- Clock's running, clock's running.
- Call it in. Take us home, Red. Call it in.

1397
01:56:18,769 --> 01:56:20,354
Gardner, Gardner! All right.

1398
01:56:20,521 --> 01:56:24,734
Split right, 213 Bootleg Screen.
Bootleg Screen!

1399
01:56:38,122 --> 01:56:39,540
- Get it off!
- Snap it.

1400
01:56:41,834 --> 01:56:43,377
Snap the ball.

1401
01:56:44,295 --> 01:56:46,631
Snap it. Snap it.

1402
01:58:11,966 --> 01:58:16,345
<i>It's good! Gardner catches the ball!</i>
<i>Touchdown! Touchdown!</i>

1403
01:58:16,512 --> 01:58:20,933
<i>I can't believe it! I can't believe it!</i>
<i>Marshall has won!</i>

1404
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:25,104
<i>The Young Thundering Herd has won!</i>
<i>They have done the unthinkable!</i>

1405
01:58:25,271 --> 01:58:27,940
- We scored?
- <i>Marshall has beaten Xavier!</i>

1406
01:58:28,107 --> 01:58:32,111
<i>This is an exciting day, folks! Incredible!</i>

1407
01:58:32,278 --> 01:58:37,074
<i>The skies parted</i>
<i>and Marshall took command!</i>

1408
01:58:37,491 --> 01:58:41,037
<i>They proved that they were men today,</i>
<i>that they were a team!</i>

1409
01:58:41,245 --> 01:58:42,955
- We did it! We did it!
- <i>Marshall wins!</i>

1410
01:58:43,122 --> 01:58:45,082
<i>Marshall wins in a barnburner, folks!</i>

1411
01:58:45,249 --> 01:58:48,586
<i>They're gonna remember this one</i>
<i>for decades!</i>

1412
01:58:52,673 --> 01:58:55,718
Lengyel! We did it!

1413
01:58:57,803 --> 01:59:01,015
We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it!

1414
01:59:13,861 --> 01:59:16,280
- Oh, gosh.
- Little tradition.

1415
01:59:16,447 --> 01:59:21,577
At the end of a game, we always give
the ball to the most valuable player.

1416
01:59:21,786 --> 01:59:23,621
That's for you.

1417
01:59:25,289 --> 01:59:28,334
Jack, I'm not one of the players.

1418
01:59:28,501 --> 01:59:30,419
I know, Don.

1419
01:59:31,546 --> 01:59:35,091
We're Marshall. We'll take anybody.

1420
01:59:36,133 --> 01:59:39,095
Thank you. Thank you, Don.

1421
01:59:56,946 --> 02:00:02,451
<i>The following week,</i>
<i>Marshall lost to Miami of Ohio, 66 to 6.</i>

1422
02:00:03,744 --> 02:00:07,540
<i>They would only win</i>
<i>one more game in 1971.</i>

1423
02:00:10,918 --> 02:00:17,175
<i>Jack Lengyel resigned as head coach</i>
<i>in 1974 with a record of 9 and 33.</i>

02:00:17,341 --> 02:00:21,387
<i>He went on to become athletic director</i>
<i>at the Naval Academy.</i>

1425
02:00:22,305 --> 02:00:24,891
<i>He's now in the Hall of Fame.</i>

1426
02:00:25,975 --> 02:00:29,770
<i>Donald Dedmon accepted the presidency</i>
<i>at Radford University...</i>

1427
02:00:29,937 --> 02:00:34,358
<i>...where he remained</i>
<i>until he retired in 1994.</i>

1428
02:00:34,525 --> 02:00:37,862
<i>Gene Morehouse's son, Keith,</i>
<i>followed in his father's footsteps...</i>

1429
02:00:38,029 --> 02:00:41,324
<i>...and became a broadcaster</i>
<i>for Marshall football...</i>

1430
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:44,827
<i>...where he still remains today.</i>

1431
02:00:45,411 --> 02:00:48,831
<i>Reggie Oliver started every game</i>
<i>at quarterback for the Thundering Herd...</i>

1432
02:00:48,998 --> 02:00:50,458
<i>...until he graduated.</i>

1433
02:00:50,625 --> 02:00:53,336
<i>He eventually returned to Marshall</i>
<i>as an assistant coach...</i>

1434
02:00:53,503 --> 02:00:55,713
<i>...and now lives in Ohio.</i>

1435

<i>Nate Ruffin moved away from Huntington</i>
<i>after graduation...</i>

1436
02:00:59,258 --> 02:01:01,719
<i>...got married and started a family.</i>

1437
02:01:01,886 --> 02:01:05,056
<i>In 2001, after a prolonged illness...</i>

1438
02:01:05,223 --> 02:01:09,227
<i>...Nate passed away at his home</i>
<i>in Arlington, Virginia.</i>

1439
02:01:09,936 --> 02:01:12,772
<i>But he would return to Huntington</i>
<i>one last time...</i>

1440
02:01:12,939 --> 02:01:16,484
<i>...for a final reunion</i>
<i>with his old teammates.</i>

1441
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:25,493
<i>Red Dawson kept his word and left the team</i>
<i>at the end of the year.</i>

1442
02:01:27,578 --> 02:01:30,206
<i>He never returned to football.</i>

1443
02:02:32,268 --> 02:02:35,396
Well, congratulations, Coach Dawson.

1444
02:02:37,398 --> 02:02:39,442
Well, thank you, Jimmy.

1445
02:02:40,151 --> 02:02:42,528
Congratulations to you too.

1446
02:02:55,416 --> 02:02:58,127
I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
I just...

1447
02:02:58,294 --> 02:03:02,632
Red, you didn't keep me waiting.

1448
02:03:03,758 --> 02:03:05,468
Come here.

1449
02:03:17,605 --> 02:03:20,316
Nobody here wants to go home either.

1450
02:03:31,202 --> 02:03:33,704
<i>Marshall lost more football games</i>
<i>in the '70s...</i>

1451

<i>...than any other program in the nation.</i>

1452
02:03:37,291 --> 02:03:40,461
<i>But yet, football remained.</i>

1453
02:03:41,212 --> 02:03:46,050

<i>with eight conference titles...</i>

02:03:51,556 --> 02:03:56,227
<i>...five straight bowl wins</i>
