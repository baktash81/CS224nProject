1
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,909
Hello. Am l on time?

2
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,869
ID, please.

3
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,707
Let me ask you,
my ticket was paid by a company,

4
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,251
can l get the miles?

5
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,089
No, there are no miles for this fare.

6
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,800
l see. Never mind, then.

7
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,552
Boarding is through gate 3.

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,387
Thanks.

9
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,204
I´ll help you.

10
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,288
Fine.

11
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,406
Business or pleasure?

12
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,325
Both, I hope.

13
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,579
What do you do?

14
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,290
l´m a model.

15
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,752
Sorry, I should have figured.

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,045
Thank you.

17
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,007
Catwalk or advertising?

18
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,341
Catwalk.

19
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,724
And you, what do you do sir?

20
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,767
- You´re killing me.
- Why?

21
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,768
You said ´´sir´´

22
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,230
and I sank
to the fifth circle of hell.

23
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,775
l have to do something
about my hair.

24
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,530
l´m a music critic.
Sounds horrible, I know.

25
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,034
It doesn´t.
Rock?

26
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,328
Now you´re trying to be nice.

27
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,705
Classical music.

28
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,708
I see.

29
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,252
My first boyfriend
was a classical musician.

30
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,713
Well, that´s what he studied.

31
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,131
What´s his name?

32
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,717
No, he´s not famous.

33
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,638
He sent in some works
back when we were together,

34
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,098
but they were never published.

35
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,435
Or printed.
What´s the right word?

36
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:53,649
Choose whatever term you like
and l´ll make it popular.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,028
Pasternak. Gabriel Pasternak.

38
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,494
Pasternak...

39
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,667
lf I´d known it, l´d have told you
I was a gravedigger, not a critic.

40
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,629
He submitted his thesis
at the Conservatory of Music

41
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,132
when I was president of the jury.
l ripped him apart.

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,134
Yes, I was with him at the time.

43
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,803
What you did to him was awful.

44
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,722
He spent a week in bed
after reading the review.

45
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,059
Sometimes I have to destroy
some poor guy´s self- esteem

46
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,853
to protect the ears
of an entire population.

47
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,107
I may be wrong sometimes,
but in this case...

48
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,234
His work was...

49
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,238
a dreadful monstrosity.

50
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,782
Are you still in touch with him?

51
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,076
We didn´t end on great terms.

52
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,912
But l´m still fond of him.
He was a good guy.

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,666
Maybe, but if you present
a piece like that to a jury

54
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,794
there has to be
something wrong with you.

55
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,714
Gabriel Pasternak!
How could l forget him?

56
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,133
We laughed about it for months.

57
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:06,430
l´m sorry to interrupt,
but I was listening to you.

58
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,473
What a huge coincidence!

59
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,476
Gabriel Pasternak
was my student

60
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,437
at Palomar Elementary School.

61
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,526
I had to tell him
he was being held back.

62
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,488
I can assure you:
the kid had issues.

63
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,575
l´ve never seen anything like it
in 30 years as a teacher.

64
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,201
He was screaming

65
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,413
and crying like a newborn baby.

66
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,290
Miss Leguizamón?

67
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,043
lgnacio Fontana.
Remember me?

68
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,379
lgnacio Fontana!

69
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,675
Unbelievable!
There´s a cosmic connection here.

70
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,554
Wasn´t Pasternak one of your classmates?

71
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,058
- Are you friends with him?
- Intimate friends.

72
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,935
Poor guy, we were awful to him.

73
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,271
This is beyond unbelievable.

74
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,482
I was a manager at Home Depot,

75
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,860
where this psycho you mentioned
worked for a while.

76
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,489
He always had trouble with customers,
so we had to let him go.

77
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,823
- And when I...
- Excuse me.

78
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,161
Does anyone else know Gabriel Pasternak?

79
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,621
- Me.
- Me too.

80
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,705
Why?

81
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,875
Why are you on this plane?

82
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,752
Did you buy your tickets?

83
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,423
l´m in real estate,
they sent it to me to check out a farm.

84
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,051
I have a meeting
with the Tourism Secretary.

85
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,677
They bought the ticket.

86
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,346
l won mine in a raffle.

87
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,475
I couldn´t change the date.
l had to fly today.

88
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,069
Gabriel Pasternak is
the cabin chief on this flight.

89
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,031
We did our training together,
we were friends.

90
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,201
Then he asked me out
and when l refused, he started to get...

91
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,411
Never mind.

92
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,872
After takeoff,
he brought coffee to the cockpit.

93
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,458
The door is locked,
the pilots won´t answer,

94
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,919
I´m desperate!
I don´t know what to do!

95
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,760
I cheated on him
with his only friend.

96
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,721
With him!

97
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,571
Gabriel!
Gabriel, are you there?

98
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,488
It´s Victor,

99
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,948
Victor Jensen!

100
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,450
Talk to me, please!

101
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,411
- Who are you?
- l was his psychiatrist for years.

102
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,123
Then I raised my fees,
he got mad and stopped seeing me.

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,666
Open the door, Gabriel!
Listen!

104
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,795
It´s not your fault!
You´re just a victim here!

105
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,714
l´m telling you, plain and simple:

106
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,467
it was your parents
who ruined your life!

107
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,552
They asked too much of you
ever since you were born,

108
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,930
they projected all their
disappointments on you!

109
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,850
They are responsible
for your suffering!

110
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,102
Gabriel, no one here...

111
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,396
has anything to do with it!

112
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,023
WlLD TALES

113
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,279
Good evening.
Party of one?

114
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,074
l see you´re good at math.

115
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,034
One, yes.

116
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,787
Wherever you like.

117
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,135
Today´s special
is lentils and rice stew.

118
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,553
Delicious!

119
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,370
Did he order?

120
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,002
That guy´s from my hometown.

121
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,298
He´s a loan shark, a gangster.

122
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,177
He auctioned our house.

123
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,931
Because of him,
my father killed himself.

124
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,561
Two weeks after the funeral,

125
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,772
he tried to seduce my mom.

126
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,319
He wouldn´t leave her alone
so we moved here.

127
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,574
You know how many times

128
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,951
l dreamed of having him

129
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,662
right in front of me?

130
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,416
I´m going to say something.

131
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,960
Say something?

132
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,130
Your dad kills himself
because of this guy,

133
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,716
and you´re just going
to insult him?

134
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,179
Let´s put rat poison in his food.

135
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,515
There´s some in the storeroom.

136
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,269
A good dose and his heart
will blow in five minutes.

137
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,449
Lots of work?

138
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,659
Not with this weather...

139
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,370
I´ve been trying to get your attention
for a while.

140
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,706
You need to check on
your customers, honey.

141
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,543
Sorry.
Can I take your order?

142
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,587
French fries with fried eggs.

143
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,964
I´ll order something else
if I´m still hungry.

144
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,137
- To drink?
- Diet Coke.

145
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,514
Diet Coke?

146
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,183
Diet Coke.

147
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,393
French fries, fried eggs.

148
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,229
Want me to write it?

149
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,151
I hate him!

150
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,367
Make him French fries with fried eggs.

151
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,206
Are you crazy?
Want me to go to prison?

152
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,458
To prison?

153
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,671
Who´ll do the autopsy on this jerk?
The FBl?

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,423
French fries with fried eggs.

155
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,676
They´ll think the cholesterol
killed him.

156
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,474
Just cook his meal, will you?

157
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,278
Can I have your opinion?

158
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,239
You seem like a smart girl.
Come here.

159
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,412
Which do you like better? This one?

160
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,206
CUENCA = SAFETY

161
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,624
Or this one?

162
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,209
The red one.

163
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,044
The red one.
Hold on.

164
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,174
Don´t l look too serious?

165
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,843
No, I think it´s fine.

166
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,261
Thank you.

167
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,895
Besides, prison´s not that bad.

168
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,188
It just has bad reputation.

169
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,151
They feed you, you don´t pay rent,

170
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,570
you have nothing to worry about.

171
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,865
And if you make nice friends,
you can have a good time.

172
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,117
You play cards...

173
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,578
Were you in prison?

174
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,370
A while.

175
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,333
And l felt freer in there than here.

176
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,251
This is shit.

177
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,545
What did you do?

178
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,964
Nothing I regret.

179
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,430
And he´s running for mayor!

180
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,557
That son of a bitch.
Can you believe it?

181
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,728
Of course I can.
Bastards rule the world.

182
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,146
Wake up, kid!

183
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,858
So?

184
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,111
Shall we do the community a favor?

185
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,701
Great!

186
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,854
You did it.

187
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,943
Don´t play naive,
as if you hadn´t noticed.

188
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,277
What?

189
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,114
That´s our country.

190
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,908
Everyone wants these guys
to get what they deserve,

191
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,703
but no one
is willing to lift a finger.

192
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,955
Be proud, kid.

193
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,168
For once in your miserable life,
you´re doing something worthwhile.

194
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,963
- I´m not doing anything.
- You´re not?

195
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,258
You stay here arguing instead of
taking the food away from him.

196
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,718
Relax.

197
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,678
You have nothing to worry about.

198
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,057
If there´s an investigation,
I´ll say l used rat poison in the kitchen

199
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,561
because we were infested,
which is true, by the way,

200
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,063
and some of it,
accidentally fell into a pot.

201
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,690
What will they say?

202
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,777
This is insane.

203
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,366
Could this shit be expired?

204
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,583
There´s no expiration date.

205
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,334
How does it work?

206
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,547
If rat poison is expired,
is it more or less harmful?

207
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,735
- Everything OK?
- Yes.

208
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,944
Have a seat.

209
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,545
- What are you having, Alexis?
- Fanta, maybe?

210
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,757
- Should l warm it up?
- No! Leave it.

211
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,384
lf I need you to warm it up, l´ll ask.

212
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,261
Can l have a Fanta, please?

213
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,851
I´ve had it with this girl.

214
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,151
We have to do something,
they´re both eating.

215
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,403
- Add more poison?
- He´s just a kid!

216
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,156
But he´ll grow up.
Like father, like son.

217
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,867
We´d better wipe out
the whole family tree.

218
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,748
l´m feeling a bit...

219
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,084
What´s wrong?

220
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:51,963
Are you OK?

221
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,297
This must be freezing cold.

222
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,882
No, stop!

223
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,302
Who the fuck taught you
how to wait tables? Leave.

224
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:16,028
You goddamned fucking bitch!

225
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,446
Stop it, dad!

226
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,990
Pick everything up.

227
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,324
Pick it up, l said.

228
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,244
Call an ambulance!

229
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,163
Pick them up, one by one!

230
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,206
Take this!

231
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,334
Take this, you thug!

232
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,713
I´ll gut you like a chicken!

233
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,095
Come on, moron, move over.

234
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,440
What´s your problem?

235
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,283
What a piece of shit!

236
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,212
You motherfucking redneck!

237
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,715
Asshole!

238
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,102
Holy Jesus.

239
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,005
l can´t believe it.

240
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,859
Hello.

241
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,406
I´m at Kilometer 60
on the route between Salta and...

242
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,949
Yes, sorry.

243
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,827
UlA719.

244
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,163
Diego Iturralde.

245
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,582
Fine.

246
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,377
I was saying, l have a flat tire,
at Kilometer 60

247
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:10,174
on the route between
Salta and Cafayate.

248
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,261
I´d like to know,
how quick can you get here?

249
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,182
See, the car´s new
and I´m not handy with the jack.

250
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,258
What´s wrong?

251
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,427
Did you get scared?

252
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,636
Come on, man, drive on.

253
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,598
Keep driving, come on!

254
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,922
Let it go, I don´t want a fight.

255
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,675
If l offended you, I apologize.

256
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,969
l´m sorry if I did.

257
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,144
Are you done?

258
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,313
Are you finished?

259
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,316
Careful with...

260
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,697
What are you... Stop!

261
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,076
Come on, man,
I didn´t do anything.

262
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,829
What was it you called me back there?

263
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,326
Oh God!

264
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,876
l already apologized.
What more do you want?

265
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,672
I´ll get out of the car if I have to,
but I don´t think it´s necessary.

266
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,007
Fuck!

267
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,134
Stop!

268
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,807
Good morning, officer.

269
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,600
I´m at Kilometer 60

270
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,936
of the route
between Salta and Cafayate

271
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,021
and I´m being attacked by a man.

272
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,774
It´s shatterproof, you won´t break it!

273
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,067
You pussy!

274
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,319
The man´s license plate is...

275
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,365
I can´t see it,
can you send a patrol car, please?

276
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,786
Perfect.

277
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,913
Hurry, he´s out of control!

278
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,837
l´m sure they´ll be here any minute.

279
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,675
Give it a rest, man!

280
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,595
You wrecked my car! Get lost!

281
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,478
What are you doing?

282
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,406
Son of a bitch!

283
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,201
You son of a bitch!

284
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,704
Fucking bastard!
Motherfucker!

285
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,964
Please!

286
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,740
Pussy!

287
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,781
What are you doing?

288
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,661
Stop, you prick!

289
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,819
You´re dead!

290
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,072
I have your license plate,
you son of a bitch!

291
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,615
Did you hear me?

292
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,201
I have your license plate! UlA!

293
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,245
l´ll hunt you down and kill you!

294
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,231
Resetting...

295
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,806
Attention, dispatch.
Truck 29 here.

296
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,766
Confirm location, please?

297
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,876
Dispatch, dispatch!

298
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,809
What´s your theory, sheriff?

299
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,103
Crime of passion?

300
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,443
How´s it going outside?

301
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,445
Ready to go, Simón.

302
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,856
Thank you.

303
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,910
Let´s do it.

304
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,123
Attention, we´re detonating!

305
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,543
Five, four...

306
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,199
Good job.

307
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,462
There, please.

308
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,755
Sign.

309
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,343
Yes, honey?

310
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:17,557
I´ll stop by the office, make a few calls
and be on my way.

311
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,186
l´ll be there at 5 with the cake.

312
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,440
I´ll be there on time, don´t worry.

313
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,877
I hope she likes it.

314
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,670
Yes, she´ll love it.

315
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,005
Thank you.

316
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,771
That´s 360 pesos.

317
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,524
What is it, imported?

318
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,776
One, two...

319
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,110
Do you have a receipt?

320
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,113
Yes, we´ve got cakes, pastries...

321
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,574
A sales slip, a receipt.

322
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,077
Yes, sure, I´ll get it for you.

323
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,589
You gang of thieves!

324
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,605
Next!

325
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,028
Hello. l parked my car...

326
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,571
Car registration, please.

327
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,287
- I don´t like that tone.
- I´m being polite, sir.

328
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,913
l don´t think so.

329
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,376
The towing fee is 490 pesos

330
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,171
and the parking ticket
will be sent to your address.

331
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,174
But l´m trying to explain.

332
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,843
The curb wasn´t painted yellow,

333
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,804
there was no way l could have known

334
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,598
it was a no-parking zone.

335
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:04,766
I understand.

336
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,478
If you want to get your car back,
you have to pay the towing fee.

337
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,730
Then you can file a complaint
Monday to Friday,

338
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,193
8 to 2 pm, at the DMV,
Carlos Pellegrini 211 , 1st floor.

339
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,907
Let´s do something else.

340
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,535
Go and talk to whoever you need to,

341
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:28,414
l want to leave with my car
without paying a penny,

342
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,376
l want a refund for the cab

343
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,586
and I want an apology.

344
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,713
Why are you laughing?
I´m serious.

345
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,257
Where is the office
where apologies are made?

346
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,511
We´re all in the same boat.
Please hurry up.

347
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,014
The parking ticket
indicates you committed an infraction,

348
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,474
we don´t need further proof.

349
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,311
Once again, if you want your car back,
you need to pay.

350
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,897
Otherwise, please leave
so l can go on working.

351
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,107
lf I don´t have cash?

352
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,776
We accept credit and debit cards,
or come back tomorrow,

353
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,112
but you´ll be charged parking fee.

354
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,534
- You know you´re a criminal?
- l´m doing my job.

355
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,663
People who work for criminals
are criminals too.

356
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,707
Right. That´s your opinion.

357
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:15,128
Just a miserable slave
to this corrupt system.

358
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,510
Thank you, have a nice day.

359
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,073
Almost there

360
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,671
Don´t bother.
Almost everyone´s gone

361
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,959
Happy birthday, Camila

362
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,092
Happy birthday, precious.

363
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,721
Can´t we do it again?

364
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,265
Forget about it, Simón.

365
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,144
Hello, baby, happy birthday.

366
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,649
Here´s the cake.

367
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,108
Hello, kids.

368
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,777
Hi, Antonio, how are you?

369
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,528
Hello, dear.

370
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,112
- How are you?
- Fine.

371
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,699
We were just leaving.

372
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,201
I´m the father.

373
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,496
I´ll see you out.

374
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,340
Why not get a cab
and pick up the car later?

375
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,927
You missed your daughter´s birthday!

376
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,222
You make it sound so easy.
l´m tired of being robbed!

377
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,267
The curb was not painted yellow!

378
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,312
Do you have any idea
how furious that makes me?

379
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,565
Do you have any idea
how furious it makes me

380
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,109
that you always have an excuse?

381
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,236
That you blame society
for everything?

382
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,738
Today was the tow truck,
yesterday was traffic,

383
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,282
tomorrow it´ll be the rally.

384
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,535
The truth is
you could have left earlier.

385
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,829
You could have helped me set up

386
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,498
and have been here to welcome
your daughter´s friends.

387
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,751
But everything else is a priority
except your family.

388
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,921
And l´m such a fool to think
one day you´ll change.

389
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,339
But you know what?

390
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,800
Society won´t change.

391
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,343
You won´t change.

392
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,971
And l´m tired.

393
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,560
What´s that supposed to mean?

394
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,939
You´re the engineer.
Do the math.

395
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,528
The government allows a company
to rake in the big bucks from these fines.

396
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,282
Obviously,
our elected officials get their cut.

397
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,660
lt´s outrageous,
but that´s how it is.

398
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,873
You have two options:
pay and relax

399
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,459
or you give yourself
a heart attack.

400
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,795
You know what?

401
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,298
l have plenty to live for.

402
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,593
I want to sail, travel around the
world with my grandchildren...

403
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,595
- Don´t get so upset.
- Right.

404
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,804
Take it easy.

405
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,229
Good morning.

406
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,067
I got this ticket.
I already paid the towing fee,

407
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,362
but there´s been a mistake,
the curb wasn´t painted yellow.

408
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,030
- May I?
- Sure.

409
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,451
lt´s 560 pesos.

410
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:19,956
Listen,

411
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:24,627
l´m a bit anxious about this,
so please, hear me out.

412
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,339
The curb wasn´t painted.

413
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,927
I think you should send someone
to the address of the infraction

414
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,596
so you can check I´m right.

415
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,932
Then, on behalf of the city government,
you should apologize,

416
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,475
because l´m right,

417
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,769
you should give me back
the towing fees

418
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,231
and compensate me for all the time
I´m wasting.

419
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:46,983
According to the ticket,

420
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,318
your car
was in a no-parking zone.

421
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,320
That´s proof enough.

422
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,199
The fine is 560 pesos
and you have to pay it either way.

423
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,119
If you don´t,
interests will start accumulating.

424
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,538
Are you listening?

425
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,165
Proof enough my ass!

426
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,585
l´m telling you the curb
was not painted yellow.

427
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:10,256
First, don´t insult me.
l´m doing my job.

428
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,342
Second, you should know
how the law works.

429
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,803
The fact that you don´t know it

430
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,181
doesn´t mean you can avoid
the consequences for breaking it.

431
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,268
If you kill someone and say:
´´I didn´t know l couldn´t do that,´´

432
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,561
you go to jail.

433
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,523
Maybe no one told you that,
but you´ll go to jail anyway.

434
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,399
Get the picture?

435
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,110
That example is pretty inaccurate.

436
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,407
I´m supposed to know by heart
where l am not allowed to park,

437
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,118
whether the spaces are marked or not?

438
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,119
Exactly.

439
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,539
That information
is available on the DMV website.

440
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,665
I see.

441
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,377
- Can you call your superior?
- There are none.

442
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,462
Really?

443
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,839
What are you?
The fucking president?

444
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,717
Sir, there´s a lot of people here.

445
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,220
If you´re not going to pay,
please step aside.

446
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,182
How does it feel to be a crook?
Tell me.

447
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,308
Security, window 7!

448
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,852
Security?
Great!

449
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,604
I´m submitting a complaint,

450
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,607
exercising my rights as a citizen,
that makes me a criminal?

451
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,816
Want to call security?

452
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,737
Call security! Go ahead!

453
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,617
Call them now! Do it!

454
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,869
What are you doing?
Get off me!

455
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,297
Sign here, please.

456
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,275
- Hey, buddy.
- How are you?

457
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,236
They didn´t rape you, did they?

458
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,781
This is unbelievable.

459
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,201
This is really... unbelievable.

460
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,120
lt´s crazy.

461
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,249
Seijas sent the company lawyer
to take care of everything.

462
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,044
Finally some goodwill,
because lately...

463
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,799
Maybe that´s not the right word...

464
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:20,094
Your name is all over the news,

465
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,846
along with the company´s name.

466
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,891
Seijas´s partners aren´t too happy.

467
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,854
The city government
is one of our biggest clients.

468
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,484
They´re letting you go, Simón.

469
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,988
lt´s been decided.

470
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,410
You´re currently unemployed,
Mr. Fischer.

471
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,121
Why, is that a crime?

472
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,915
I never said that.

473
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,753
But it sounded like
that´s what you were implying.

474
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,256
lt´s not a crime,
but it is a problem

475
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,426
when you have to provide
for your family every month.

476
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,137
She´s referring to child support,

477
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,515
which includes clothing,
tuition, medical insurance.

478
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,808
Excuse me.

479
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,355
l´ve supported my wife year round
ever since l met her.

480
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,817
And my daughter will always have
what she needs.

481
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,653
lf I have a problem,
don´t worry, I´ll work it out.

482
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,656
Fortunately my client is now working,

483
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:27,953
so we don´t see why Mr. Fischer
should have shared custody.

484
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,246
Excuse me.

485
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,752
I´ve been paying for everything
for years.

486
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,922
Just because this month
she´s employed and l´m not,

487
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,967
I don´t have the right
to joint custody of our daughter?

488
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:45,804
l hope the judge realizes
how unfair this situation is.

489
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,806
What the judge will realize

490
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,100
is how violent you are
when you refer to your wife...

491
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,852
What violence?

492
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,357
I´m describing reality,
where do you see violence?

493
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:00,402
I see violence all over the place,
Mr. Fischer.

494
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,446
I see violence on the streets,

495
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,949
when l turn on the TV.

496
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:09,119
And I see violence
in this newspaper article.

497
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:14,875
I´m convinced that less contact
a child has with this kind of event,

498
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,378
the better it´ll be for her well-being.

499
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,506
Victoria, do you want to take
my daughter away from me?

500
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,342
No, I don´t want to take
your daughter away from you.

501
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,552
What´s wrong?
Are you going crazy?

502
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,223
My client and l are finished here,

503
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,559
we´ll see each other again in court.

504
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,271
You´re not going to say anything?

505
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,397
Are you working for her?

506
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,274
- Get a therapist, Mr. Fischer.
- What?

507
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,984
It´s from the heart.

508
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,709
l´ll talk to you later,
someone´s here.

509
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,002
A kiss.

510
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,004
Hello.

511
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:05,175
l´m Simón Fischer,
I spoke with Mr. Ederer´s secretary.

512
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,427
I´m supposed to leave my CV.

513
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,470
Sure, l´ll give it to her.

514
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,140
I´d rather give it to her personally,

515
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,436
and if Mr. Ederer´s here,
l´d like to have a word with him.

516
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,521
I worked for over ten years

517
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,190
at Seijas Raffo Martinez and Associates.

518
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,358
I´m not a rookie.

519
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,861
The engineer is on a construction site.

520
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:24,987
And his secretary?

521
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,780
She´s out for lunch.

522
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,867
It´s 4 pm.

523
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,828
I don´t handle her schedule.

524
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,288
You know what?

525
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,957
l won´t leave a damn thing.

526
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,878
You can all go fuck yourselves:
you, Ederer and his secretary.

527
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,298
Especially his secretary.
Go fuck yourselves.

528
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,886
Lunch at 4 pm?
They must think I´m an idiot!

529
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,524
The blue Chevrolet?

530
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,553
You´re rude.

531
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,096
This is a fascist regime.

532
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,974
I have to pay first and complain later?

533
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,225
Exactly.

534
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,435
You won´t stop until a tragedy occurs.

535
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:47,040
´´An act of terrorism,´´
according to the official version.

536
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,418
The defense claims it was an accident.

537
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:53,005
´´The engineer worked with explosives,

538
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:56,800
´´and the tow truck movement
caused the explosion.´´

539
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,302
The prosecutor responds:

540
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:01,513
´´The fact there were no victims
proves the engineer

541
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,266
´´meticulously calculated
the explosion range.´´

542
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,893
This is the 4th time
my car´s been towed.

543
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,854
Help me Dynamite!

544
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,231
Please Dynamite:
Blow up the tax office!

545
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,276
lnsurance company refuses to pay:

546
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:18,447
´´The tow truck company´s responsible
for the damages.´´

547
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:23,535
There are questions about the tow truck
company´s concession.

548
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,704
On social networks,

549
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:29,916
thousands demand the release
of the engineer known as ´´Dynamite.´´

550
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,421
Thank you.

551
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,476
Happy birthday, Dynamite...

552
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,522
Dad.

553
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,239
What happened?

554
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,410
What happened, Santiago?

555
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,370
Say something!

556
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,359
Promise me he won´t go to jail.

557
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,403
We´ll do everything we can.

558
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:09,785
We reiterate: right on Libertador Avenue,

559
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,371
a driver struck a pregnant woman
and drove off.

560
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,208
The driver did not stop
to help the victim...

561
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,294
Santiago, tell me the truth.

562
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,545
Were you drinking?

563
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,339
Did you smoke pot?

564
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,383
The eye witnesses couldn´t identify

565
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,094
the car brand nor the license plate.

566
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:33,892
As we speak, the police is
analyzing security camera footage

567
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,020
in order to identify the vehicle´s owner.

568
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,774
Hit and run.

569
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,653
Another murderer behind the wheel...

570
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,156
Who´s the car registered to?

571
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,825
It´s in my name.

572
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,785
- And this is the registered address?
- Yes.

573
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,495
What have l done?

574
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,623
What have you done?
You ruined our life, you asshole!

575
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,583
Help him, Mauricio, please!

576
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,001
Get him out.

577
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,464
Santiago, listen,
l need to ask you some questions.

578
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,924
Look at me.

579
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,803
Was anyone else in the car?

580
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,599
Did you tell anyone what happened?

581
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:15,642
No.

582
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,478
Let´s take a look at the car.

583
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,816
The windows are tinted.

584
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,154
Were they closed?

585
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,615
l think so.

586
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,868
- Try to remember.
- Yes.

587
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,329
Did you get out of the car
to see what happened

588
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,831
or did you keep driving?

589
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,791
l kept driving.

590
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,002
Where were you coming from?

591
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,171
A bar downtown.

592
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,425
Did anyone see you arrive
or leave in the car?

593
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,011
Your friends, a girl?

594
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,888
I swear l can´t remember.

595
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,853
Unfortunately,
we have just been informed

596
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,273
that in the ambulance
heading to the hospital

597
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:07,110
both the woman
and her unborn child passed away.

598
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,448
Police is still gathering information

599
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,159
through footage from security cameras

600
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:18,496
and interrogating witnesses...

601
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,658
- Thank you, ma´am.
- You´re welcome.

602
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:06,252
l´m really embarrassed to have
to make this proposition...

603
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:12,384
but we´ve known each other for years

604
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,179
and I feel we have this kind of bond.

605
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,640
Besides,

606
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,436
you´re a father,
l know you want the best for your kids...

607
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,606
So I think this arrangement

608
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,693
may be good for you too.

609
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:37,242
If you say you took the car for a drive

610
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,954
last night while we were sleeping...

611
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,834
and that you were driving
at the time of the accident,

612
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,586
l´ll hire the best lawyer

613
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,717
to get you the shortest sentence
possible...

614
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:57,012
With good behavior,
you´ll be out in a year and a half.

615
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,430
- Is that right?
- That´s right.

616
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,057
Good.

617
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,810
And for doing me that huge favor,

618
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,646
l´ll pay you 500,000 dollars.

619
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,986
You wouldn´t earn that in a lifetime.

620
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,490
And your family will be set for life.

621
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,659
You know Santiago...

622
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,913
He wouldn´t survive in prison.

623
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,125
He couldn´t stand it.

624
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,477
José...

625
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,313
Please, sit in the car.

626
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,902
Grab the wheel with both hands.

627
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,404
Touch it everywhere.

628
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,700
Good.

629
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,911
You´d had some whiskey.

630
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,829
Your bosses were sleeping.

631
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,082
As you parked the car, like every night,

632
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,626
you felt like going for a ride.

633
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:14,631
If they'd asked, you'd have said
the tires needed air.

634
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,967
Then you bumped into something

635
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,887
and you can´t remember anything
after that

636
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,972
until you woke up in here.

637
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,353
José,

638
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,897
l can´t thank you enough.

639
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,607
Don´t touch him, please.

640
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,234
lt´s alright, ma´am.

641
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:42,659
Excuse me.

642
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:47,956
I´ve been thinking and...
l don´t know...

643
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,875
I´d like to discuss it with my wife.

644
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,255
She can´t know about it.
At least not now.

645
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,006
We can´t take the risk.

646
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,050
What if she talks?
Think about it.

647
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,593
You end up with no deal

648
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:03,346
and you´d go to prison for perjury.

649
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,806
Fine.

650
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,224
Honey...

651
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,394
Well, then.

652
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:15,191
You two take my van
and go to the country house.

653
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,110
When you drive by a toll booth,
look down.

654
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,864
Don´t stop at gas stations,
if you want to buy something,

655
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:24,075
pay cash, don´t use your credit card.

656
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:26,995
Come on.

657
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,084
Let´s go!

658
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,841
Get in the car again, please.

659
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,801
He should sit in the back.

660
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,220
Bring the seat forward.

661
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:54,439
You two go upstairs
and go to sleep.

662
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,650
You don´t know anything, okay?

663
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,696
You calm down

664
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,574
and keep quiet.
I´ll take care of this.

665
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,755
That´s okay.

666
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,928
- Mauricio Pereyra?
- I´m his attorney.

667
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,596
l was about to call the police.

668
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:29,224
Come in, please.
Such an awful tragedy!

669
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:33,311
An hour ago,
my client heard noises downstairs.

670
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,647
He thought someone had broken in.

671
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:39,317
He went into the garage
and found the groundskeeper

672
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:44,155
sitting in his car, drunk,
in a state of shock.

673
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,784
Then he heard the news, he put two
and two together and he called me.

674
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:52,497
Mauricio Pereyra,
this is the prosecutor on duty.

675
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,834
And this is José.

676
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:00,171
He´s worked for the family for what?
1 5 years?

677
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:05,927
Now we´re going to speak
to the victim´s husband.

678
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,553
The father of the unborn child...

679
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,723
Sir, what do you have to say?

680
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,184
What do l have to say?
What do you think?

681
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,728
Turn that off, it´s not necessary.

682
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,856
I´ve got one thing to say.

683
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,526
Whoever did this is going to pay.

684
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,611
Are you listening?

685
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,614
No matter where you hide,
l´m going to...

686
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,325
Very well. What happened, José?

687
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:30,785
Excuse me.

688
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,579
José,
you have the right to remain silent.

689
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:37,333
I´ll be representing Mr. Torres
at my client´s request.

690
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:41,587
He has never had any trouble
with the law and he´s the father of two.

691
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,383
Can you tell me about the accident?

692
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,930
l always park Mr. Mauricio´s car.

693
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:55,893
l wanted to take the new one for a ride,

694
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,354
to take the Beemer for a spin.

695
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,606
And last night...

696
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,859
l´d been drinking.

697
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,695
And l went for it.

698
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,032
I never thought something
like this could happen.

699
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,952
I went down Libertador Avenue

700
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:17,332
and I sped up.
I was driving really fast.

701
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,001
And l bumped into something,
l couldn´t tell what it was.

702
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,544
lt was a blur.

703
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,712
I thought it was a dog.

704
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,548
l heard a loud thud...

705
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,009
And l got scared

706
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,386
because l thought l´d dented the car.

707
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,723
l wanted to return and try to fix it

708
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,017
before Mr. Mauricio woke up.

709
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,754
May I?

710
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,162
José, can you please sit
in the driver´s seat?

711
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,008
- Should I touch it?
- Yes, grab the wheel.

712
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,013
Sit back.

713
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,355
Could you shut the door?

714
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:20,037
Do you use the rear view mirrors
when you drive?

715
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,873
The mirrors?
Yes, of course l do.

716
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,500
Because in this position,
you can only see the roof.

717
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:27,253
lt´s a miracle
you only ran over one person.

718
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,298
They must have moved
during the crash.

719
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,675
All at the same time?

720
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,052
Yes...

721
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,684
I think this car was driven
by someone much taller than you.

722
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,020
Does anyone else live in the house?

723
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,106
My wife, my son...

724
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,274
my dog.

725
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:50,860
No need to wake up the dog,

726
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,904
but l´d like to meet
your wife and son.

727
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,741
Sure, no problem.
We´ll ask them to come down.

728
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:01,662
Do I have your permission
to start negotiating?

729
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,615
ls it that bad?

730
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:20,700
No, everything´s fine.

731
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:26,122
He´s willing to make a deal,
but it´s going to be expensive.

732
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,540
How expensive?

733
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,291
One million.

734
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,667
Dollars?

735
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,920
He saw your house, the way you live.
He won´t take less than that.

736
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,423
The good news is
he´ll take care of everything.

737
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,384
He knows the police chief,
most of the judges

738
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,386
and he´ll help us reinforce the alibi.

739
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:43,347
The groundskeeper´s?
Can´t we leave him out?

740
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,808
Somebody´s got to be responsible.

741
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,727
Two people are dead,
it was all over the news.

742
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,229
Fine, but l don´t know
if I have that much cash.

743
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:51,355
lt´s 1 .5 million dollars!

744
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:53,316
And there´s my cut too.

745
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:54,650
Your cut?

746
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:58,195
Of course.
I´m the one negotiating all this.

747
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,197
l pay your firm a fortune every year!

748
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:05,286
This is different.
These are not fees.

749
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,706
l´m putting my name on the line.

750
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:13,169
I was about to lend you my car
so your wife and son could make a getaway.

751
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,920
You´re not being fair.

752
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:17,006
How much are we talking about?

753
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,133
I don´t know.
Half a million?

754
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:24,055
Look, if you´d like to call
another lawyer,

755
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,390
that´s fine by me,
my work ends here.

756
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:31,145
Go and close the deal.

757
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,668
Is everything okay, José?

758
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,419
Well, not really.

759
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:56,796
Why not?

760
01:17:56,963 --> 01:18:00,299
For going to prison,
I´m getting the same as your lawyer?

761
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,551
l know I´m poor, but...

762
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,929
- What you´re doing is awful.
- Awful?

763
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,765
Then you go to prison.

764
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,851
Last night l watched a Western,
had a cup of tea

765
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,728
and went to bed early.

766
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,982
What else do you want, José?
Be clear, time is running out.

767
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,860
The money we agreed on...

768
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,154
and an apartment in Mar de Ajó.

769
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,241
Mauricio, José.

770
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,702
Can we all talk?

771
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,666
Justice, justice!

772
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:39,964
Let´s get to the point, gentlemen,
time is of the essence,

773
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,007
there´s no room
for misunderstandings.

774
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,468
The story stays the same.

775
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:48,389
l´m going to need you
and your family to testify,

776
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,890
so no one leaves town.

777
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,560
You´ll leave the house in cuffs,
with a hood on.

778
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,730
Outside there´ll be press
and angry people,

779
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:59,066
they'll ask you questions,
call you names, don't say a word.

780
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,570
We avoid controversy,
let the trial move along,

781
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,114
get a conviction and everyone´s happy.

782
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,825
Stop, mom! It´s my life!

783
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,245
He wants to go out there and confess...

784
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,621
lt´s the right thing to do!

785
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:14,999
Say something,
he has no idea what he's doing!

786
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,917
Santiago, calm down...

787
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,252
Your mom is right,

788
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,004
we´ll fix this.

789
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,215
Can you shut the door
and take care of Santiago, please?

790
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,884
Let´s go!

791
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,469
Calm down, Santi.

792
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:30,681
Can we proceed?

793
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,144
From now on, you´ll be the middle man.

794
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:38,397
l won´t talk to Mr. Pereyra again
until he testifies in court.

795
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,276
And you, José, avoid talking
to anyone except your lawyer.

796
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,360
Perfect.

797
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,113
l´ll need some cash
for operational expenses,

798
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,656
let´s say 30,000 dollars.

799
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,575
l´ll need it first thing on Monday.

800
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,410
Just one question.

801
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:55,623
What do you mean
by operational expenses?

802
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,083
There are officers outside,
the police chief is there.

803
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,962
If someone saw or heard anything,
we need to cut them in.

804
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:05,216
We have to avoid loose ends.

805
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:06,550
So if you're OK...

806
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,053
You´ll have the money on Monday,

807
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,847
but it´s coming out
of the budget we agreed on,

808
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:13,432
I won´t pay one more penny.

809
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,393
- Mauricio, please.
- Yes, please...

810
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,813
That´s what I say. Please!

811
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,232
I know l´m in a rough spot,

812
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,109
but l won´t be gutted like this.

813
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:27,863
What the prosecutor
is saying is reasonable.

814
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:31,075
Let´s not argue over 30,000 dollars.

815
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:34,036
You pay it then.
Take it out of your share.

816
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,250
Gentlemen, there´s no time for arguing.

817
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,252
If you want to proceed
we have to do it now.

818
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:42,419
Then you pay it.

819
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,004
You´re getting 1 million dollars

820
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,799
and you want an extra
30,000 for contingencies?

821
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,801
Who´s getting a million?

822
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,141
He´s right.

823
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:59,728
The million includes contingencies.

824
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,691
Your cut plus the 30,000 add up
to a million dollars.

825
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,568
Don´t touch my cut.

826
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,864
You know what, guys?

827
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,533
lt´s over. The deal is off.

828
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,578
What do you mean it´s off?

829
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:16,996
lt´s off!

830
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,832
It´s over! No one gets anything!

831
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,625
No more!

832
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,168
Santiago!

833
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,422
You said you wanted to confess?

834
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,425
That´s perfect.
Go out there and talk.

835
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,343
l gave you the best education

836
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:33,721
and you always did
whatever you wanted.

837
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,890
So now, go screw yourself!

838
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,061
Calm down.

839
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,938
Can we be reasonable?

840
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:44,690
What happened?

841
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,985
They´re all vultures!
That´s what happened!

842
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,112
But it´s over.
l didn´t kill anyone!

843
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,784
...the house of the alleged murderer
right here in San lsidro.

844
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,579
This morning there was
an accident on Libertador Avenue...

845
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:30,361
Open the door.
I have something important to tell you.

846
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,574
Can we talk in a civilized manner?

847
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,117
What?

848
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,702
It´s settled, we have an agreement.

849
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,996
The 30,000 dollars will come
out of everyone´s share.

850
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:43,165
l don´t want to hear about it!
lt´s over!

851
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,042
Get out of my house!

852
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,461
Let me remind you
two people are dead.

853
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,421
lf Santiago is found guilty,

854
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:51,632
it will cost us much more.

855
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,259
José, on the other hand, is penniless.

856
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,429
Right, so who will compensate
the victim´s family?

857
01:22:57,597 --> 01:23:00,349
The money should go to them,
that´s the right thing to do.

858
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,726
That scumbag earns a salary
that comes out of my taxes?

859
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,687
He should investigate what happened!

860
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,231
You want to represent my son?
Discuss your fees with him!

861
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,358
lf he can pay,
it´s between you two.

862
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:10,985
Do what you have to do!

863
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,403
Do your job!

864
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,488
We had a deal,

865
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,657
it´s not honorable to back out.

866
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,868
I´m sorry if l offended you,

867
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:23,956
but I´ve always defended
your family´s interests.

868
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:27,126
I thank you with all my heart!
You´re an angel!

869
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,804
Can l talk to them

870
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,765
to see if l can improve the terms?

871
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,103
Excuse me.

872
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,315
Listen,

873
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:53,444
I think we have
a better deal to offer you.

874
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,363
José takes the initial 500,000

875
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,575
and says forget about
the apartment on the beach.

876
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,994
The prosecutor and I
split the million.

877
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,454
Not one penny more.

878
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,039
But we have to do it now,
Mauricio.

879
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:08,584
The press is outside
and the prosecutor needs

880
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,503
to let the police chief
into the house.

881
01:24:12,922 --> 01:24:14,006
No!

882
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,342
l´ll put up a total of one million

883
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,344
and you split it any way you want.

884
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:22,431
- What do you mean, one million?
- Take it or leave it!

885
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,433
If you don´t like it, get lost!

886
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,894
You come back here with
any other proposal

887
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,645
and l´ll press charges against
you for extortion.

888
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:31,190
Against you and the prosecutor!

889
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,613
Prosecutor, can you reveal
the identity of the suspect?

890
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,156
l can´t give any details right now,

891
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:42,076
but the case is virtually closed.

892
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:43,285
There´s only one suspect

893
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,662
and l´m about to present
the brief to the judge.

894
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:46,789
Thank you.

895
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,958
Justice, justice!

896
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:55,172
Watch out!

897
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,960
Always showing some skin, Bocha!

898
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,180
And now...

899
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:49,434
it´s time we all stand up

900
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:51,645
and give a big hand

901
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,273
to welcome our dear...

902
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,984
Romina and Ariel!

903
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,107
Let me hug my father-in-law!

904
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:41,486
Take good care of her.

905
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:44,698
I´ll be watching.

906
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,828
Thank you!

907
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,707
l gave him a few good tips...

908
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,617
Long live the newly weds!

909
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:24,047
Everyone look this way.

910
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:31,513
A big smile!

911
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:35,058
Thank you very much.

912
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:36,893
Thanks!

913
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,270
Thank you.

914
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,689
Enjoy.

915
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,233
Romina.

916
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,655
This is a little something for you.

917
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:52,492
You shouldn´t have.

918
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,453
You being here is gift enough.

919
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,204
Are you having a good time?

920
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:58,957
Lovely.
You´re so beautiful!

921
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:01,960
Your family is so nice.

922
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:04,755
Too bad this country is so unsafe.

923
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:08,800
Roni´s wallet was stolen last night
and he didn´t even realize it.

924
01:29:08,968 --> 01:29:10,510
That´s horrible!

925
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:11,845
How awful!

926
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,972
Yes, things are bad now,

927
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,265
but little by little...

928
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:18,685
So many beautiful people.
All friends of yours?

929
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:24,232
Well, those are our friends
from the country club.

930
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,984
We hadn´t seen each other
since we were 1 3,

931
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:28,653
but with Facebook and all,
we got back in touch.

932
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,946
Facebook!

933
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:33,367
Those back there
are my college friends

934
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,160
with their boyfriends.

935
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,537
Well, the ones who have boyfriends.

936
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:39,498
Those are...

937
01:29:39,665 --> 01:29:42,000
Ariel´s co-workers...

938
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,546
Are you having a good time?

939
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:49,341
- Yes. Are you?
- Good...

940
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,427
Your typical wedding.

941
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,180
You´re something, you know?

942
01:29:58,476 --> 01:29:59,643
Enjoy.

943
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:00,977
You too.

944
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,817
Do you know any good place

945
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:09,027
for us to learn the tango?

946
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:12,906
Yes! No... Not me.
But I know my cousin would.

947
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,658
I´ll introduce you.

948
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,388
Fuck! I don´t...

949
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:19,931
What is it?

950
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:23,018
No more wine for you.

951
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:26,438
No, don´t do that.
Act like you´re talking to me.

952
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,868
Ariel, who´s that girl
with the long hair?

953
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:22,911
Which one?

954
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:26,164
That one over there.
Your co-worker.

955
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:31,253
Lourdes.

956
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:33,380
Why?

957
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:35,674
No reason.

958
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,845
And how does Lourdes know
your guitar teacher?

959
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:44,099
My guitar teacher?

960
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,144
A few months ago
someone called your phone

961
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,982
when I answered, they hung up.
You said it was your guitar teacher.

962
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,401
lt seemed weird, so l saved the number.

963
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,029
And now I call and Lourdes picks up.

964
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,825
I don´t know what you´re talking about.

965
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:03,243
You don´t know?

966
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:08,748
With all the cell phone companies
and special deals out there,

967
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:12,627
this girl just happened to buy
your guitar teacher´s phone line?

968
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,213
Especially if you never
introduced them.

969
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,465
lsn´t it an amazing coincidence?

970
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:21,261
- So?
- What?

971
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,930
Answer me or I´ll ask her myself.

972
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,141
- Romi, please, don´t.
- Don´t ´´Romi´´ me!

973
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:28,184
Answer my question!

974
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:33,857
Ariel, does everyone at table 27
know that you fucked that girl?

975
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:38,945
Did you invite all those jerks
to our wedding? How could you?

976
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,114
l´m sorry to interrupt.

977
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,825
May I have this dance
with the prince?

978
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:45,827
Of course, my queen.

979
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,871
Here´s your prince.

980
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,044
What happened?

981
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,378
Nothing.

982
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,389
Romi, are you okay?

983
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:10,977
What is it?

984
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:13,396
Just a moment.

985
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,279
Bocha, can I have a minute?

986
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:33,249
Honey.

987
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,253
Baby, stop it.
Let´s enjoy our wedding.

988
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:42,008
Did you sleep with that girl?

989
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,931
Please, tell me the truth,

990
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:49,891
l need to know.

991
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:56,940
Yes, baby.

992
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:02,696
But it didn´t mean anything to me,
I swear.

993
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:06,157
Romi, please,
let´s not make a scene here.

994
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:07,909
- It was a mistake.
- Let me go!

995
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,536
l´m sorry! Really, l made a mistake.

996
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,954
I want to be alone!

997
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:01,880
What was that?

998
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:04,549
- Did you see her?
- You´re asking me?

999
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,194
Everything okay?

1000
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,034
Shall I get somebody?

1001
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:36,623
Are you all right?

1002
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:41,419
Clearly you´re not all right.

1003
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,340
Calm down.
What happened?

1004
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:49,427
l just found out my husband
cheated on me

1005
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:51,387
with one of our wedding guests.

1006
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:52,806
That´s awful.

1007
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,476
And now I don´t know what to do

1008
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:59,687
with all those people down there.

1009
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,690
Calm down, these things happen...

1010
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:04,025
Time heals all wounds.

1011
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:05,568
Here.

1012
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:12,242
lf you love him,
you´ll be able to forgive him.

1013
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:15,036
- If he´s the one for you...
- l don´t know if I love him!

1014
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,500
l don´t know if he´s the one for me...

1015
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:23,127
He´s an asshole!

1016
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:24,629
Well, then...

1017
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,048
To hell with him.

1018
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:28,842
And don´t worry about the guests,

1019
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:31,261
you´re not the first woman
at that party to be cheated on.

1020
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:32,512
Plus,

1021
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,390
if you spend your time worrying
about what other people think

1022
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,433
you´re screwed, kiddo.

1023
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:41,813
All better?

1024
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:45,024
Look...

1025
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,652
lf I were you,
I´d go downstairs,

1026
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,239
move the party along, end it early,

1027
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:55,159
and then, back at home,
tell him it´s over.

1028
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:58,705
What happened to you is awful,
I won´t deny it.

1029
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:01,249
But you have to move on.

1030
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,379
Better?

1031
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:22,622
Romina?

1032
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,294
Get the hell out of here!
Don´t say a word!

1033
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,297
You don´t know
who you´re messing with!

1034
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:33,800
l´ll take every penny you have,

1035
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,886
every property your dad put
in your name

1036
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:38,388
to get around taxes

1037
01:39:38,555 --> 01:39:39,597
will be mine.

1038
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:40,848
We are married.

1039
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,351
Legally married.

1040
01:39:43,519 --> 01:39:47,981
I´ll spend all my days
sleeping with any man who looks my way

1041
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,608
anyone who gives me
an ounce of love.

1042
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:53,027
And when it´s you
who wants the divorce,

1043
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:54,737
l´ll take acting lessons

1044
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,490
so l can stand before the judge
like a sad little puppy

1045
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,034
and tell him l´m fighting
to make this work,

1046
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:02,996
that way our marriage
will last forever.

1047
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,999
l´ll post all your secrets on Facebook!

1048
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:10,003
I´ll torture you
until you scream with pain.

1049
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:13,965
You´ll be so humiliated
that your only way out

1050
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,884
will be jumping off a bridge.

1051
01:40:17,052 --> 01:40:17,927
And then,

1052
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,013
when death do us part,

1053
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:24,058
when your death do us part,
I´ll have it all.

1054
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,441
Ariel, calm down.

1055
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:32,775
Come on, buddy.

1056
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:56,424
Where the hell have you been?

1057
01:41:06,643 --> 01:41:07,477
Stop!

1058
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:15,151
Put me down!

1059
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,029
Put me down, assholes!

1060
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,615
Gustavo, tell them to let me down!

1061
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:24,452
Something is wrong!

1062
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:25,912
Can´t you get them to
put me down!

1063
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,829
l´m telling them!

1064
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,998
Marianito! Turco!

1065
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,124
Careful, boys.

1066
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:32,752
Goddamn it, Comanche!

1067
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:37,924
Stop it!

1068
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:42,011
Assholes!

1069
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:45,950
Leaving already?

1070
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:48,202
No, no, stay.

1071
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:52,623
We worked it out.
Really, don´t worry, come with me.

1072
01:43:04,219 --> 01:43:06,012
Stop, I´m getting dizzy!

1073
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,389
Relax, this is great!

1074
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,641
Stop it, please!

1075
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:14,353
Did you ever go to that amusement park?

1076
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:17,565
The one they closed down
because the rollercoaster flew off the...

1077
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:26,991
Call a doctor!

1078
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,535
...and she threatened to take
every last dime,

1079
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,746
even all his properties...

1080
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:34,498
- We´re taking her home...
- Yes, that´d be the best.

1081
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:39,462
I´m very sorry about this.
It was still a wonderful party.

1082
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:41,589
Excuse me, please.

1083
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:45,343
Most of the cuts are superficial,
they´ll heal quickly.

1084
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:47,803
But we´ll take her in just to make sure

1085
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:49,430
that no tendons are torn.

1086
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:51,849
Does she have good medical insurance?

1087
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:56,270
Romina, please, go back inside.

1088
01:43:56,438 --> 01:43:59,023
l´m just asking about her insurance.

1089
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:00,566
Great. Stay there.

1090
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:07,114
l´m fine.

1091
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:11,744
Romi, dear, are you okay?

1092
01:44:12,537 --> 01:44:15,164
- Are you sure?
- Yes, don´t worry. Relax.

1093
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:20,962
Why don´t we use this break
to cut the cake?

1094
01:44:32,724 --> 01:44:35,810
Come on, girls,
don´t leave me hanging here.

1095
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:37,645
Come on, girls.

1096
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:44,193
It´s been a terrible night,
but now l want to relax

1097
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:45,569
and enjoy my wedding.

1098
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,366
l don´t think l´ll get married again.

1099
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:53,327
Now!

1100
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,038
Romi!

1101
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,875
Mili, you got it!

1102
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:01,585
l can´t believe it!

1103
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:04,463
A picture with Mili!

1104
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:13,597
Wouldn´t you like to marry Mili?

1105
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:16,267
Come on!

1106
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:19,228
All the rest may be bullshit,

1107
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:21,397
but let´s prove the ring tradition
comes true!

1108
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:22,606
Wouldn´t that be great?

1109
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:24,400
Stop, Romi.

1110
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,444
Kiss...

1111
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:37,997
We should do the garters,
toss the bouquet...

1112
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:40,166
Do you want to continue
or call this off?

1113
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:43,419
We´re calling it off.

1114
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:46,255
But why? You´re such a party pooper!

1115
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,215
Girls, here it goes!

1116
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,970
Besides, we still haven´t had
the hot pastrami.

1117
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:55,181
Boy, that was expensive!

1118
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,515
Ariel, tell them.

1119
01:45:56,683 --> 01:46:00,561
We spent a whole week arguing
about the pastrami.

1120
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:03,981
We decided on it, we paid for it,
and now I want some.

1121
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:05,816
Romina! Stop it!

1122
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,110
Let everyone go home.

1123
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,363
This isn´t a joke.

1124
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:14,909
My family´s lawyer even suggested
I press charges against you.

1125
01:46:23,168 --> 01:46:26,087
Don´t tell me this is all mommy´s idea.

1126
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:28,964
Cut it out, Romina!

1127
01:46:29,591 --> 01:46:31,592
Your mom is a real...

1128
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,052
wedding planner.

1129
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,428
Stop it!

1130
01:46:36,973 --> 01:46:38,599
What did I do to you?

1131
01:46:39,017 --> 01:46:42,311
lt was nothing compared to
what you´re doing to me!

1132
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:51,737
Son,

1133
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:55,116
please, calm down.

1134
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:56,450
Please.

1135
01:47:00,622 --> 01:47:01,789
God...

1136
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:08,254
Shoot this, Nestor.

1137
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:12,800
Nestor, turn the camera on.

1138
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:15,678
You too, get over here.

1139
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,931
Shoot this, please.

1140
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,352
lf I get married again...

1141
01:47:24,646 --> 01:47:28,065
lf I ever find a guy who´s worth it...

1142
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:32,570
I´m going to show this video
at our wedding!

1143
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:37,408
l´ll even watch this with my kids.

1144
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:41,912
lnstead of Dora the Explorer
and all that crap, l´ll play this video.

1145
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,832
I know!

1146
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:49,253
I´ll put it on one of those digital picture
frames that play photos

1147
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:50,379
in a loop!

1148
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:57,178
Get off my daughter, bitch.

1149
01:47:58,472 --> 01:47:59,763
Stay out or it´s hell!

1150
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:01,474
I was going to help you, Bocha.

1151
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:03,267
Cuca, come here.

1152
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:10,524
Honey, are you all right?

1153
01:48:45,435 --> 01:48:46,435
Doctor!

1154
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:51,815
You take care of her,
you take him.

1155
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:53,567
What is he on?

1156
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:56,487
Nothing, he had an emotional shock.
No drugs here...

1157
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:57,780
Can you walk?

1158
01:48:57,948 --> 01:48:59,448
What´s the name of the bride?

1159
01:49:00,742 --> 01:49:01,700
Romina...

1160
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:06,205
l need you to sit down so
l can take your blood pressure.

1161
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:09,833
A chair, Mauro!

1162
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:11,210
Sit down.

1163
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,170
Take his jacket off, please.

1164
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:16,799
Can you sit down?

1165
01:49:21,763 --> 01:49:23,013
Are you okay?

1166
01:49:23,181 --> 01:49:24,807
Relax, Romi, relax.

1167
01:49:31,022 --> 01:49:32,982
Can you get her some water?

1168
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,738
Easy, Romi.

1169
01:49:39,906 --> 01:49:40,906
You just need to rest.

1170
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:01,552
Wait, Ariel.

1171
01:50:05,765 --> 01:50:07,141
Calm down.

1172
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:09,518
It´s fine.

1173
01:50:21,489 --> 01:50:23,991
Nothing happened.
We are all right. Okay?

1174
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,284
Relax.

1175
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:55,272
No, Ariel!

1176
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,246
Easy...
