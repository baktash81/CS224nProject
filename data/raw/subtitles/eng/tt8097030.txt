00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>The number one rule
in my family?</i>

3
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:56,077
<i>Honor your parents.</i>

4
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:59,748
<i>They're the supreme beings
who gave you life</i>

5
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:02,209
<i>who sweated
and sacrificed so much</i>

6
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:04,502
<i>to put a roof
over your head,</i>

7
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:05,754
<i>food on your plate,</i>

8
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,340
<i>an epic amount of food.</i>

9
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:10,675
<i>The least you can do
in return is</i>

10
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:13,261
<i>every single thing
they ask.</i>

11
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:17,182
<i>'Course some people are like,
"Be careful.</i>

12
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,517
<i>"Honoring your parents
sounds great,</i>

13
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:21,686
<i>"but if you take it too far,</i>

14
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,148
<i>"well, you might forget
to honor yourself."</i>

15
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,277
Luckily,
I don't have that problem.

16
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:32,906
I'm Meilin Lee.

17
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,284
And ever since I turned 13,
I've been doing my own thing.

18
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,080
Making my own moves,
24/7, 365.

19
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,749
I wear what I want,
say what I want

20
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:44,417
and I will not
hesitate to do

21
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,379
a spontaneous cartwheel
if I feel so moved.

22
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,005
Oh, crap!

23
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:52,467
Not to brag,

24
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,303
but being 13 means
I'm officially a grown-up.

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,764
At least according to the
Toronto Transit Commission.

26
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,932
Good for you.

27
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,270
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

28
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,146
All about that hustle,
am I right?

29
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:23,915
Besties, assemble!

30
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,500
- Miriam!
- Hmm?

31
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:27,294
Hey!

32
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,296
Priya!

33
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,424
Yo.

34
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,426
Abby!

35
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,887
Yeah. What's up, Mei?

36
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:41,558
Ready to change the world?

37
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,726
So ready.

38
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,019
I was born to do this.

39
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,937
Let's burn this place
to the ground!

40
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:47,731
Y equals negative four.

41
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,359
Manitoba,
Alberta, and Saskatchewan.

42
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,404
<i>I know, it's a lot...</i>

43
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:58,033
But this is grade eight.

44
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,451
I don't got time
to mess around.

45
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:01,953
I guess you could call me...

46
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:07,083
A very enterprising,
mildly annoying young lady.

47
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,793
A major weirdo.

48
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:11,171
An overachieving dork-narc.

49
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,632
I accept
and embrace all labels.

50
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,221
- Oops.
- Hey!

51
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:21,306
- Aah!
- Oh, you're dead!

52
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:22,682
Coming through!

53
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,559
Move, please!

54
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,186
Share the sidewalk, people!

55
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:28,563
Anyway, who cares what stupid,

56
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,315
evil Tyler
or anyone else thinks?

57
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:31,691
This is gonna be my year.

58
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,984
Mei, Mei, Mei,
come see this!

59
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,487
And nothing's gonna stop
this train from...

60
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,821
Shh. Come on, come on!

61
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,114
- Get your butt over here!
- Go, go, go.

62
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:40,533
Come on, come on.
Mei, Mei, fast!

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,743
- Shut up!
- Shh!

64
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,206
- Huh?
- Mmm-hmm!

65
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:47,916
- Uh...
- Mmm.

66
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,042
Devon.

67
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,174
My mom cuts his hair
at the salon,

68
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:58,009
and I felt it. It's very soft.

69
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,594
Whoa. Can I have some?

70
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,179
Yeah, Abby, hook a sister up.

71
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:02,347
Ugh!

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,932
He looks like a hobo.

73
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,266
A hot hobo.

74
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,353
May I remind you
what real men look like?

75
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:10,188
4-Town!

76
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,023
Yes! 4-Town!

77
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,485
<i>Jesse went to art school.</i>

78
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,822
<i>Tae Young fosters</i>

79
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,156
<i>injured doves.</i>

80
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,868
<i>Robaire speaks French.</i>

81
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,036
Hey!

82
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,788
<i>And Aaron T. and Aaron Z.</i>

83
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:28,206
<i>are, like,
really talented, too.</i>

84
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:33,294
- We are 4-Townies, remember?
- Ride or die!

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,302
Yeah, but tickets
to 4-Town are, like,

86
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:43,388
a bajillion dollars,
and Devon's right here.

87
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:44,556
And free!

88
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,809
Ah, fudgesicles! I gotta go.

89
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:50,103
Wait! We're going
karaokeing today.

90
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,271
- Yeah!
- Come with us.

91
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:53,648
Please.

92
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,442
- Please.
- I...

93
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,986
can't. It's cleaning day.

94
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:00,989
Mei, every day
is cleaning day.

95
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:02,574
Can't you just
get one afternoon off?

96
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:04,951
But I like cleaning.

97
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:06,327
Plus,
I got this new feather duster

98
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:07,454
and, oh, my gosh, you guys,

99
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,581
it picks up so much dirt,
it's bananas!

100
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,374
Fine. I'll let you go.

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,003
If you can pass the gauntlet.

102
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:17,922
- Come on. Uh! Oh.
- Mir, not now...

103
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,424
You can't resist it.

104
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:20,550
Come on.

105
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,010
You know you want to.

106
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,012
Here we go.

107
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:26,055
<i>You're never not on my mind</i>

108
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:28,516
<i>- Oh, my, oh, my
- Oh, yeah, oh, my</i>

109
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,393
<i>I'm never not by your side,
your side</i>

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,561
Yeah.

111
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,812
<i>Your side</i>

112
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,063
- Peace sign.
- All right!

113
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,565
Yeah! Go, Mei!

114
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,442
- See, that was good!
- That was dope!

115
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:38,610
You passed.

116
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,612
And here is your reward.

117
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:41,779
Ninety-nine Australian tour,

118
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,907
with the <i>Girl I Love</i>
<i>Your Jeans</i> remix.

119
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:48,077
O-M-G, Mir!
I'll guard it with my life!

120
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,289
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

121
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:52,415
4-Town 4-ever!

122
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:53,625
4-ever!

123
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,212
We'll karaoke another time,
I promise!

124
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:58,379
Okay, sure, Mei!

125
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,965
It'll be on me.
The snacks, the tunes...

126
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,967
- Whoo!
- You're my jam, girl.

127
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,768
She's so brainwashed.

128
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:15,855
Crud, crud, crud.

129
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:18,733
<i>Okay.</i>

130
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:19,817
Excuse me.

131
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,110
<i>I know what it looks like.</i>

132
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,905
<i>I am my own person.</i>

133
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,824
<i>But that doesn't mean
doing whatever I want.</i>

134
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:28,243
- Hello, Meilin.
- Hey, how's it going?

135
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,911
Thank you, Meilin!

136
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:34,749
<i>Like most adults,
I have responsibilities.</i>

137
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,793
Hey, Bart. Hey, Lisa.

138
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,964
- Hello, Meilin.
- 'Sup?

139
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,383
Still down for a rematch,
Mr. Gao?

140
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,551
Bring it, Lee!

141
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,971
What a good girl.

142
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,722
<i>It's not all about me,
you know?</i>

143
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,646
<i>I do make my own moves,
it's just that...</i>

144
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:03,278
<i>...some of my moves
are also hers.</i>

145
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:04,988
Mei-Mei, there you are.

146
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,447
- Hey, Mom...
- You're ten minutes late.

147
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,283
What happened? Are you hurt?
Are you hungry?

148
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,576
Um...

149
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:10,743
How was school today?

150
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,705
Killed it per usual.
Check it out.

151
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,165
Oh. That's my little scholar.

152
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:17,458
Today, honor student,

153
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,919
tomorrow,
UN Secretary General.

154
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,589
The ancestors
would be so proud.

155
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:39,147
Sun Yee, revered ancestor,
guardian of the red pandas.

156
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:42,692
We humbly thank you
for protecting and guiding us.

157
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,485
Especially Mei-Mei.

158
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,406
May we continue
to serve and honor you

159
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:49,907
and this community.

160
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:51,618
Always.

161
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,430
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

162
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,568
Have fun

163
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,944
getting that off.

164
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,029
Shoo-shoo! You vandals!

165
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:29,155
Oh, snap!
They're coming!

166
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:30,823
- You good-for-nothing hosers!
- Go, go, go!

167
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,617
I'm telling your mothers!

168
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,745
Our family runs
one of the oldest temples

169
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,664
in Toronto.
And the most unique.

170
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:41,084
Instead of honoring a god,
we honor our ancestors.

171
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,877
And not just the dudes either.

172
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:46,047
Our most revered ancestor,
Sun Yee,

173
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,092
was a scholar, poet,
and defender of animals.

174
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:52,261
She dedicated her life to
the creatures of the forest.

175
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,430
Especially the red panda.

176
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:55,598
- Ta-da!
- Ooh!

177
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,475
Which she loved
for its fiery coat

178
00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:59,102
and mischievous nature.

179
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,397
Ever since, the red panda
has blessed our family

180
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:04,399
with good fortune
and prosperity...

181
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:07,235
And it can bless yours, too!

182
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,074
- Bye-bye!
- See you next time!

183
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:14,450
Thanks for coming.

184
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,915
- Give me five.
- Yeah.

185
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,084
- Come on. Dad's making dinner.
- Ooh.

186
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:47,024
Mmm.

187
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:50,236
Huh? Uh...

188
00:09:58,786 --> 00:09:59,871
He should have listened

189
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:01,164
to his mother
and married Ling-Yi.

190
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,750
Totally.
Siu-Jyu is so two-faced.

191
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,127
She's just using him
to get to the throne.

192
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:08,087
She'll probably stab him
on their wedding night.

193
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,255
Mmm-hmm.

194
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,299
Hmm?

195
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,176
Mmm. Hmm!

196
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,385
- Perfect.
- Yes!

197
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:15,553
<i>You've heard their hits,</i>

198
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:16,721
<i>you've seen their moves.</i>

199
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,973
<i>And now, you get
to experience them live!</i>

200
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,017
<i>The worldwide
pop sensation 4-Town</i>

201
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,227
<i>will be kicking off
their North American tour!</i>

202
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:24,854
<i>Tickets on sale now.</i>

203
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,397
Oh, my gosh!

204
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:28,608
Who are these hip-hoppers?

205
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,276
And why are they called
"4-Town"

206
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,569
if there are five of them?

207
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,446
Uh... I don't know.

208
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,281
Some of the kids
at school like them.

209
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:39,076
You mean Miriam?
That girl is odd.

210
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:41,829
Dinner's ready.

211
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,795
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

212
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,422
<i>You're never not on my mind</i>

213
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,591
<i>Oh my, oh my</i>

214
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:57,887
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

215
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,517
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

216
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:06,521
<i>I'm gonna be your ride or die
All right</i>

217
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:16,781
Hmm. Kinda looks like Devon.

218
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,660
I don't get
what Mir sees in him.

219
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,245
He's not that cute.

220
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:27,583
Okay, his shoulder's, like,
kind of nice, I guess.

221
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,921
His eyes are... fine.

222
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,631
Mei-Mei.

223
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:17,049
Ow! Ah!

224
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:22,597
Do you want a snack?

225
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:24,056
Cool, great, thanks.

226
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,308
<i>Don't look at the notebook,</i>

227
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,517
<i>don't look
at the notebook, don't!</i>

228
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,270
<i>No!</i>

229
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:33,190
Oh.

230
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,609
- Is this your homework?
- Mom...

231
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,611
- Don't!
- Oh, my. What... What is...

232
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:37,987
- Do not.
- Huh? What?

233
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:39,947
- Mom.
- Oh! Oh.

234
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,158
Huh? Huh?

235
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,326
Mei-Mei, what is this?

236
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:45,077
It's nothing. Just a boy.
He's no one.

237
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:46,454
A boy?

238
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:48,205
Who is he?
Did he do these things to you?

239
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,875
No! It's just made up, Mom!

240
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,377
It's not real.

241
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:55,463
That hat.

242
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,549
Is that the sketchy clerk
from the Daisy Mart?

243
00:12:58,633 --> 00:12:59,675
Mom, no!

244
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:03,304
What are you doing?

245
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:07,099
No, no, no!

246
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,393
No, no, no!

247
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,395
Oh, snap!

248
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,065
Mom, no!

249
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,524
- You!
- Whoa!

250
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,901
What have you done
to my Mei-Mei?

251
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:18,319
Uh... Who?

252
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:20,112
Meilin Lee, right here.

253
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,157
I should report you
to the police.

254
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,867
How old are you? Thirty?

255
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,243
I'm seventeen.

256
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,662
Oh, see, see?

257
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,288
This is what happens
when you don't wear sunblock

258
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,665
and do drugs all day!

259
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,750
She's just a sweet,
innocent child.

260
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,877
How dare you
take advantage of her!

261
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:37,880
Mom! No!

262
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:42,510
What?

263
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,304
What a weirdo.

264
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:47,807
Look at her.

265
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:57,149
The Daisy Mart has lost
a loyal customer today.

266
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,825
Thank goodness I was here.

267
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,285
That degenerate
won't come near you again.

268
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:13,708
Now, is there anything else
I should know about, Mei-Mei?

269
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,836
Nope. All good.

270
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:28,264
You sicko!
What were you thinking?

271
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,057
Why would you
draw those things?

272
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:32,560
Those horrible, awful,
sexy things?

273
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,770
It's fine.
You'll move to another city,

274
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:35,896
change your identity.

275
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:41,694
Mommy, I'm so sorry.

276
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,449
You are her pride and joy,
so act like it!

277
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,752
This will never happen again.

278
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:04,819
No! No, no, no!

279
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:15,830
Mei-Mei...

280
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,124
are you up?

281
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,378
Breakfast is ready!

282
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,130
- Mmm.
- Hey! No sugar.

283
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,551
Coming!

284
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:33,722
Mmm. Porridge.

285
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,613
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

286
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:00,040
- Wake up, wake up, wake up!
- Mei-Mei,

287
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:01,167
is everything okay?

288
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,751
Don't come in here!

289
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,421
Mei-Mei, what's going on,
honey? Are you sick?

290
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:07,965
Is it a fever? A stomach ache?
Chills? Constipation?

291
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:09,133
No!

292
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,260
Wait. Is it...

293
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:13,971
that? Did the...

294
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,307
Did the red peony bloom?

295
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:17,474
No!

296
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:19,602
Maybe?

297
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,936
But it's too soon.

298
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,398
Don't worry, Mei-Mei.
I'll get everything you need.

299
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,774
Mommy's here.

300
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,986
Jin. Jin! It's happening!

301
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,990
Come on! Please!

302
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,659
- Mei-Mei, I'm coming.
- Crud.

303
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:36,994
- I'm coming.
- No!

304
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,121
It's going to be okay.

305
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:41,207
No, it's not!
Will you just get out?

306
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,084
Excuse me?

307
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:48,505
I didn't mean that.
I'm a gross red monster!

308
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,425
Stop it! Stop talking!

309
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:56,722
Mei-Mei,
I know this is upsetting,

310
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:59,350
but we are going
to get through this together.

311
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:03,938
I have ibuprofen, vitamin B,
a hot water bottle, and pads.

312
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,273
Regular, overnight, scented,
unscented, thin, ultrathin...

313
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,483
- Uh-huh. All right.
- ...ultrathin with wings...

314
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,276
Awesome.
Just leave them by the sink.

315
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:11,320
Mei-Mei.
Perhaps we should talk

316
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:12,655
about why this is happening.

317
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:15,866
No! I mean, nah, it's okay.

318
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,786
You are a woman now.

319
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,162
And your body

320
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:21,747
- is starting to change.
- Mmm-hmm.

321
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,249
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

322
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:24,416
Mom, please!

323
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,544
You are now a beautiful,
strong flower.

324
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,046
No, no, no.

325
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,714
Who must protect
your delicate petals

326
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:32,591
and clean them regularly.

327
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,344
- Ming? Ming!
- My porridge.

328
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,137
Jin. Jin!

329
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,430
Jin, open a window!

330
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:39,515
Somebody call emergency!

331
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,063
I'll just go to sleep,
and when I wake up...

332
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,439
this will all be over.

333
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,077
What the...

334
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,584
Whoa.

335
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:18,929
Yes!

336
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:21,598
No!

337
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:24,685
Oh.

338
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:29,606
I'm calm.

339
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,234
Zen.

340
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:36,655
Yes.

341
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,622
Okay. No biggie.

342
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:48,250
You'll figure this out, Lee.

343
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,210
Just be the calm,

344
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:52,755
mature adult

345
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,715
you totally are.

346
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,009
You got this.

347
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:10,689
I know it feels strange,
Mei-Mei,

348
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,484
but I promise,
nobody will notice a thing.

349
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:16,612
Thank you
for your concern, Mother.

350
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,946
But I'll be fine.

351
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,408
Well, here's your lunch.
I packed extra snacks.

352
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:24,536
And herbal tea. For cramps.
It helps relax your...

353
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,829
I got it. Thank you. Bye.

354
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,352
Let's go, Beavers!
Let's go!

355
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,191
Hey, Mei.

356
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:57,319
Hey, girlfriends.
What is up?

357
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,114
Uh, what's with the tuque?

358
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:02,408
Uh... Bad hair day.

359
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:03,909
Did you, like,
work out this morning?

360
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:05,244
I got you, girl.

361
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,413
- Mei, we gotta talk.
- Okay.

362
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:08,622
Tyler's been telling everyone

363
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:09,998
- about the Daisy Mart.
- What?

364
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:11,375
He said
your mom went nuts.

365
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,501
And that you're
kind of a perv.

366
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,002
I am not a...

367
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:18,298
Tyler is an insecure jerkwad.

368
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:19,675
Words were exchanged.

369
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:22,261
Slightly uncomfortable secrets
were revealed.

370
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:26,640
End of story...

371
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:38,402
Uh, Mei?

372
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:40,154
Why are you staring
at Carter Murphy-Mayhew?

373
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,655
I wasn't.

374
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:44,074
No!

375
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,368
Tyler keeps putting these up.

376
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:47,744
Knock it off, butthead.

377
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:49,037
Not funny, Tyler!

378
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:51,874
Devon, my precious manly man.

379
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,000
I banish you.

380
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,585
- Literally go away!
- Begone!

381
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:55,961
I'm gonna kill him!

382
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,171
What is wrong with you?

383
00:21:57,254 --> 00:21:58,338
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
You wanna do this?

384
00:21:58,505 --> 00:21:59,506
Leave her alone!

385
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,841
You want
a piece of me, huh? Come here!

386
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:02,050
Smell you later, dorks.

387
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:03,927
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Get out of here, dude.

388
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:05,387
Gotta go.

389
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:06,805
- Uh, see you at lunch.
- Mei?

390
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,941
What's with her?

391
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,443
What's with your face?

392
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:21,695
What is with you?
You're being weird.

393
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,448
I'm just really excited
about math.

394
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:26,033
All right, guys.

395
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,910
The quadratic formula.

396
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,787
Let the fun begin.

397
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,999
Who can tell me
how the formula begins?

398
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:36,168
X equals...

399
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:40,672
What a surprise, no one.
Okay, listen up.

400
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:43,884
X equals negative B,
plus or minus,

401
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:46,553
don't forget that plus
or minus, or I promise you,

402
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,972
you will live to regret it.

403
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:58,023
No. No. No.

404
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:00,442
- Hi. Uh, ma'am?
- This isn't happening.

405
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,237
- Hi!
- My child goes to this school.

406
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:05,322
Why don't you come
to the front office?

407
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:06,532
- I'm sure that someone can...
- Keep your...

408
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:07,699
Ow!

409
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:08,867
I pay my taxes.

410
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,244
Whoa, what is that?

411
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:12,412
All right, all right,

412
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:14,206
settle down, little goblins.

413
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,624
- Stop it!
- Whoa!

414
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,042
Mei-Mei!

415
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,461
- No. Please, no.
- Mei-Mei, help!

416
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:21,547
Mei-Mei, tell him it's me!

417
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:24,132
Mei-Mei!

418
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,592
I will report you
for trespassing.

419
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:26,843
Tell him it's Mommy!

420
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:31,139
Mei-Mei!
Tell him you forgot your pads!

421
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:50,367
Mei-Mei.

422
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,578
Come back!

423
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:08,594
O-M-G!

424
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,558
Hey, I gotta go!
Open up!

425
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:23,025
Mei-Mei! Stop!

426
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:28,071
Jin. Jin, get home now.
There's been an emergency.

427
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:29,281
<i>Is it the woman thing?</i>

428
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:30,532
No! Another one.

429
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,285
It's so good.

430
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,411
Run!

431
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:36,038
It's a monster!

432
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:52,137
Awooga!

433
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,221
Huh?

434
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,281
Uh-oh.

435
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:26,546
Mei-Mei.

436
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,758
Mei-Mei.

437
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:32,302
Gotta get home! Gotta hide!

438
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,184
Mei-Mei.

439
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:08,213
Mei-Mei.

440
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:12,801
Mei-Mei!

441
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:16,972
Oh!

442
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:18,890
Mei-Mei!

443
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:23,395
Mei-Mei?

444
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:27,607
Don't look at me! Stay back!

445
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:31,945
Sweetie,
it's okay. Mommy is here.

446
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,697
What's happening to me?

447
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:36,408
What is it? What... What...

448
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,452
It's happened already?

449
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,792
What did you say?

450
00:26:50,672 --> 00:26:51,673
Ming?

451
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:53,759
It's time.

452
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:18,200
As you know,
our ancestor, Sun Yee,

453
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:21,203
had a mystical connection
with red pandas.

454
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:25,415
In fact,
she loved them so much

455
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:28,710
that she asked the gods
to turn her into one.

456
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:34,966
<i>It was wartime.
The men were all gone.</i>

457
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:38,428
<i>Sun Yee
was desperate for a way</i>

458
00:27:38,512 --> 00:27:40,680
<i>to protect herself
and her daughters.</i>

459
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,725
<i>Then one night,
during a red moon,</i>

460
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,061
<i>the gods granted her wish.</i>

461
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:49,481
<i>They gave her the ability
to harness her emotions</i>

462
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:53,276
<i>to transform into a powerful,
mystical beast.</i>

463
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:56,488
<i>She was able
to fend off bandits,</i>

464
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:57,697
<i>protect her village,</i>

465
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,991
<i>and save her family from ruin.</i>

466
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,328
<i>Sun Yee passed this gift
to her daughters,</i>

467
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:05,205
<i>for when they came of age.</i>

468
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:07,415
And they passed it to theirs.

469
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:08,708
But over time,

470
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:11,545
our family chose
to come to a new world.

471
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:14,422
And what was a blessing
became...

472
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:16,174
an inconvenience.

473
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:22,556
Are you serious?

474
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,641
- No!
- Mei-Mei, no!

475
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:26,226
- It's a curse!
- She meant it as a blessing.

476
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:28,228
You cursed us!
It's all your fault!

477
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:31,106
Mei-Mei, stop!
Listen to me. Listen!

478
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:32,691
There's a cure!

479
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:38,363
Really? How do you know?

480
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,199
Because it happened to me.

481
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,327
Why didn't you warn me?

482
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:46,496
I thought I had more time!

483
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:47,831
You're just a child.

484
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:49,666
I thought, if I watched you
like a hawk,

485
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,627
I'd see the signs
and be able to prepare.

486
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:55,922
But it's going to be fine.
I overcame it

487
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:57,799
and you will too.

488
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,051
On the next red moon,

489
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:01,761
you'll undergo a ritual

490
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:03,722
that will seal
your red panda spirit

491
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,557
into one of these.

492
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:08,310
And then
you'll be cured for good.

493
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,353
Just like me.

494
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:14,524
But any strong emotion
will release the panda.

495
00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:16,443
And the more you release it,

496
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:19,654
the more difficult
the ritual will be.

497
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:23,909
There is a darkness
to the panda, Mei-Mei.

498
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:27,162
You only have
one chance to banish it,

499
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,205
and you cannot fail.

500
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:32,459
Otherwise,
you'll never be free.

501
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:37,088
Let's see, the next red moon
will be the 25th.

502
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,965
That's a whole month away.

503
00:29:39,132 --> 00:29:40,592
We'll wait it out together.

504
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:44,721
And I'll be with you
every step of the way.

505
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:55,440
Not bad.

506
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,153
I saved Wilfred.

507
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:01,655
Thanks, Dad.

508
00:30:04,491 --> 00:30:06,826
It's only temporary, Mei-Mei.

509
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:11,373
This way, we won't worry about
any more accidents. Hmm?

510
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,004
Sleep tight.

511
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:25,095
Red is a lucky color.

512
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:42,946
<i>This is awful.</i>

513
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:45,281
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

514
00:30:45,782 --> 00:30:47,742
<i>Don't worry.
We'll get through this.</i>

515
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,745
<i>No one
can see her like this.</i>

516
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:53,206
<i>I never wanted this for her.</i>

517
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,835
<i>Did you see
how she was in the temple?</i>

518
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,170
<i>Her eyes...</i>

519
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:37,125
Please...

520
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,003
just...

521
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,256
go away.

522
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:47,927
No!

523
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,597
Why? Why?

524
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:51,765
Mei, it's us.

525
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:52,932
- Open up.
- Crud, no.

526
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:55,060
Guys, what are you doing?
Go away!

527
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,978
Are you okay?
Tap if you can hear us.

528
00:31:57,145 --> 00:31:58,438
One for yes, two for no!

529
00:31:58,605 --> 00:31:59,606
We were so worried.

530
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,649
We thought
you died of embarrassment.

531
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,526
You need more pads?
I brought extra.

532
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:06,696
Forget that.
4-Town's coming to Toronto!

533
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:08,782
What?

534
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,241
Hey!

535
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:11,493
It's okay, everybody be quiet!

536
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:12,577
Everybody, it's just me!
Shut up!

537
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:13,828
It's okay, it's me!

538
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:16,039
It's Mei!
Calm down, all right?

539
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:18,166
I'm gonna let go
and you're gonna be chill.

540
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:19,250
Got that?

541
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,919
Mmm-hmm.

542
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:22,087
Chill.

543
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:24,506
Mei?

544
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:27,133
Are you a werewolf?

545
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,301
No! What?

546
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,512
- She is a red panda!
- Sick.

547
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:33,098
You're so fluffy!
You're so fluffy!

548
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:35,934
- I've always wanted a tail.
- Priya, Abby, quit it.

549
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:37,727
Mei, what the heck happened?

550
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:42,607
It's just some, you know,
inconvenient, uh,

551
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:45,735
genetic thingy
I got from my mom.

552
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:49,030
I mean...
It'll go away.

553
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:50,657
Eventually.

554
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,283
Maybe.

555
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:56,955
Aw, Mei.

556
00:32:57,122 --> 00:33:01,000
I hate this!
I'm slobby, I'm smelly.

557
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,253
My mom won't even look at me,

558
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,130
and now 4-Town?

559
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,048
When are they coming?

560
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:09,008
May 18th.
They just announced it.

561
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:10,426
The 18th?

562
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,429
There's no way
this will be gone by then.

563
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:17,600
Just go.
Go become women without me.

564
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:20,562
Mei. It's gonna be okay.

565
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:24,357
No, it's not. I'm a freak.

566
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:25,817
Just...

567
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:27,277
Just leave me alone.

568
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,127
Mmm. Yeah.

569
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:46,171
Mmm. Let's go.

570
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:47,755
Mmm.

571
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,965
Yeah. Mmm.

572
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,175
- Let's go.
<i>- I've never met</i>

573
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:53,845
<i>nobody like you</i>

574
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:57,015
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

575
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:58,349
<i>It's true</i>

576
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:01,227
<i>But they don't turn my tummy</i>

577
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:03,021
<i>The way you do</i>

578
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:05,940
<i>I've never met nobody</i>

579
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:07,317
<i>Like you</i>

580
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:13,281
<i>You're never not on my mind?</i>

581
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,617
<i>Oh, my, oh, my</i>

582
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:20,538
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

583
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:25,251
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

584
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,463
<i>I'll never not be your ride
or die</i>

585
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,714
<i>All right!</i>

586
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,216
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Go, Mei!

587
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:34,177
- Thanks, guys.
- You're the best.

588
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:36,638
- Aw, we love you, Mei.
- You're our girl.

589
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:40,058
Yeah. No matter what.
Panda or no panda.

590
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:45,605
Whoa.

591
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:46,940
- Mei!
- You're you!

592
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:48,816
And you look amazing!

593
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:50,610
Red looks so good on you.

594
00:34:50,777 --> 00:34:51,778
Is it gone?

595
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:54,447
For now.
But if I get too excited,

596
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,990
it'll come right back... Ow!

597
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:57,700
Abby, what the heck?

598
00:34:58,409 --> 00:34:59,577
Huh?

599
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,372
Something feels different.

600
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,625
Abby, hit me.

601
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,962
Ow.

602
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:10,129
Oh, my gosh!

603
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:11,631
I stayed calm.

604
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:15,677
Something about you guys,
like, neutralizes the panda.

605
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:17,637
Aw! It's our love.

606
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:19,097
We're like a warm
and fuzzy blanket.

607
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,181
Yeah.

608
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:23,017
This means
I can have my room back.

609
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:25,603
I can
have my life back!

610
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,064
No. Even better.

611
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:29,691
You can come with us
to 4-Town!

612
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:30,858
Yeah!

613
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:33,194
This could be our only chance
to see them together.

614
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:35,238
We're all asking
our parents tonight.

615
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:36,489
We're making our stand.

616
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:37,949
Yeah. You in or you out?

617
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:42,787
But I can't ask my mom.
I'm a furry ticking time bomb!

618
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,205
Of awesomeness!

619
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:46,165
And now you can control it!

620
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:49,919
So just prove it to her,
and she's gotta let you go!

621
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,171
Mei-Mei?

622
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:53,381
Crap! You guys better go.

623
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:54,590
- But...
- No "buts," Mir.

624
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:55,758
My mom
already doesn't like you.

625
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:57,010
Wait, she doesn't?

626
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:58,469
I'll call you, I promise.

627
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,388
- We love you, Mei.
- Hang in there, girl.

628
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:02,432
Everything okay?
I thought I heard...

629
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:05,476
Mom, I think
I've made a breakthrough.

630
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:13,735
Ready.

631
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:15,445
Deforestation.

632
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:18,656
Sad orangutan.

633
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:20,116
Mmm!

634
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,035
Your second place
spelling bee trophy.

635
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:28,041
The important thing
is you tried.

636
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,584
You spelled
your little butt off.

637
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:31,461
First place in our hearts.

638
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:38,968
What a shame.

639
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:06,704
So cute!

640
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:10,917
No. So fuzzy.

641
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:15,463
Must resist.

642
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:20,760
We love you, girl.

643
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:22,720
We love you, girl.

644
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,514
Panda or no panda.

645
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,898
How adorable.

646
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:36,401
Mei.

647
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:39,779
How is this possible?
What happened to your panda?

648
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:42,407
It's easy.
When I start to get emotional,

649
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:44,534
all I do is imagine the people

650
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:45,868
I love most
in the whole world.

651
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:47,036
Oh.

652
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:50,039
- Which is you guys.
- Oh.

653
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,999
Oh, Mei-Mei.

654
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,129
So, now that that's settled,

655
00:37:56,295 --> 00:38:01,342
I just have one
teeny-tiny favor to ask.

656
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,553
No. Absolutely not.

657
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,389
What?

658
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:07,849
But this is
once in a lifetime.

659
00:38:08,015 --> 00:38:10,768
Mei-Mei, it's one thing to
stay calm at home or school,

660
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:11,978
but a concert?

661
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:13,646
You'll get whipped up
into a frenzy

662
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:14,814
and panda all over the place.

663
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:17,400
I won't, I won't! I promise!

664
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:18,734
You saw me keep it in.

665
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:21,195
Ming, maybe
we should trust her.

666
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,822
It's them I don't trust.

667
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:24,490
Look at those
glittery delinquents

668
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,617
- with their...
- gyrations.

669
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,829
Why on earth
do you want to go so badly?

670
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,789
Chug! Chug! Chug!

671
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:37,753
Like I said,

672
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,548
I just want to broaden
my musical horizons.

673
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:43,050
This isn't music.
This is filth.

674
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:45,553
And it's not worth
jeopardizing your life over.

675
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,929
- Right, Jin?
- Uh...

676
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:50,141
See? Your father agrees.
No concert. And that's final.

677
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,231
Okay, well, thanks
for listening. Good night.

678
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:07,783
What was that?

679
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,453
Am I the only one
who sees the danger here?

680
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,663
There's no way
she could keep her panda in.

681
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,249
And $200? For what?

682
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,960
Who do they think they are?
Celine Dion?

683
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:21,756
Hmm. Unbelievable.
I saw that look.

684
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:23,132
Where did she get that from?

685
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:24,884
Treating her own mother
like that.

686
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:26,177
Hold on.
Ming, it's your mother.

687
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,345
I'm not here!

688
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,975
Mother. Hello.

689
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:34,727
<i>How's everything in Florida?</i>

690
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:37,939
Ming.
I know about Mei-Mei.

691
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:39,732
<i>I was just about
to call you,</i>

692
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,234
but everything's fine.

693
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:43,444
I'm gonna handle
the ritual on my own.

694
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:47,198
The way you "handled"
Mei-Mei being on the news?

695
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:49,367
No one knows anything.

696
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:50,910
<i>They barely saw her.</i>

697
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:54,080
I'm on my way.
With reinforcements.

698
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:56,040
No! I can handle it. I can...

699
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:00,253
Run!

700
00:40:00,336 --> 00:40:02,046
Eyes on the balls, guys!

701
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:03,589
Be water! Be...

702
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:06,467
That presentation
was bomb-dot-com.

703
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:07,802
I cited all my sources.

704
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:11,305
I had sparklers.
And she still said no!

705
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:13,432
My parents said
I could go when I'm 30.

706
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,059
Mine called it stripper music.

707
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:16,686
What's wrong with that?

708
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,854
Mine said yes,
but I have to buy the ticket.

709
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,023
Who the heck's
got that kind of cash?

710
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:25,861
I know my mom's worried,
but sometimes she's just so...

711
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,322
- So...
- Wacko?

712
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:31,993
Ma'am! Please!

713
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,744
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lee!

714
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:35,288
I see you!

715
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,498
Little momma's girl.

716
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:41,168
No wonder Mei is such a loser.

717
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:55,725
Illegal throw!
You're out, Lee.

718
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:57,226
What? But, Mr. K, he...

719
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,520
Mei, chill.
Let's go, let's go.

720
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:01,063
Calm down, Mei.

721
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:03,649
Dude, keep it together.

722
00:41:03,816 --> 00:41:06,652
I can't. We need
to see this concert.

723
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:09,780
Why doesn't my mom get that?
I never ask for anything.

724
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:11,657
My whole life
I've been her perfect

725
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:14,076
little Mei-Mei.
Temple duties, grades...

726
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:15,828
- Violin!
- Tap dancing.

727
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:18,289
Yeah. We've been so good.

728
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,750
If they don't trust us anyway,
then what's the point?

729
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,627
Wow! Who are you?

730
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:24,545
- I love it!
- Fight the power!

731
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:26,922
Yeah. Yeah.

732
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:30,217
This isn't just
our first concert.

733
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:33,554
This is our first step
into womanhood.

734
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:36,599
And we have to do it together.

735
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:40,019
I'm in, girl. We'll say
it's a sleepover at my house.

736
00:41:40,186 --> 00:41:41,228
The perfect crime.

737
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:43,731
Yes! My mom will never know.

738
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:46,108
Now we just got to
raise the money for tickets.

739
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:47,818
Come on, girls, think!

740
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,657
Know what'll help me think?

741
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:54,116
- A little panda.
- Abby...

742
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:56,077
Come on, Mei.
It'll clear my mind.

743
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:58,579
Just a little hit!
It's so cute!

744
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:00,247
Ugh. Fine.

745
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:09,215
<i>Mon amour.</i>

746
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,511
Happy?

747
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:15,471
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.

748
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:17,640
O-M-G.

749
00:42:17,765 --> 00:42:19,684
Aah! Go away!

750
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,395
That was you in the bathroom!
I didn't imagine it!

751
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,730
- Yeah, you did.
- Get lost, Stacy.

752
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,024
But she's like a magical bear?

753
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:28,192
Red panda!

754
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:33,614
You are the cutest thing ever!

755
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:34,865
Come out, please?

756
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:36,117
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Please!

757
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,536
Wait. So, you like the panda?

758
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,287
Like it? I love it!

759
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,039
I'll give you anything! Money?

760
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:43,999
- My kidney!
- My soul.

761
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,418
- Yeah!
- Adorable!

762
00:42:45,584 --> 00:42:46,794
You're so cute!

763
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:51,173
Is it on?

764
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,342
- Let's go!
- Yeah, panda!

765
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,761
<i>- Fuel for domination.
- Money, money, money!</i>

766
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:56,929
<i>Stop hogging
and give me some!</i>

767
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:58,013
<i>Pass that over.</i>

768
00:42:58,097 --> 00:42:59,807
<i>4-Town, here we come!</i>

769
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,476
<i>Stop! That's so gross.
Do it again.</i>

770
00:43:02,643 --> 00:43:03,978
<i>All right, troops, listen up.</i>

771
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,815
Operation 4-Town Shake Down
is about to commence.

772
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:11,110
The boys are coming
to the SkyDome May 18th.

773
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:14,530
Our goal, four tickets.
That's 800 bucks!

774
00:43:14,697 --> 00:43:17,283
Step one,
neutralize the empress.

775
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,744
Mathletes?
Isn't it a little dangerous

776
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:21,328
to join an after-school
club now?

777
00:43:21,495 --> 00:43:23,748
What's dangerous
is an academic record

778
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:25,833
with a lack
of extracurriculars.

779
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,501
Hmm... Huh.

780
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:30,254
Step two... Spread the word.

781
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:43,768
<i>And step three...</i>

782
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:46,562
<i>hustle this panda
and squeeze</i>

783
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:47,897
<i>every last loonie
outta those kids.</i>

784
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:53,903
<i>And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

785
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:59,658
<i>Did it on my own</i>

786
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,120
<i>Own</i>

787
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:07,416
<i>Did it on my own, yeah</i>

788
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,088
<i>You know what's up</i>

789
00:44:15,257 --> 00:44:17,426
<i>You know it's us, yeah</i>

790
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:18,719
<i>You ready?</i>

791
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:20,596
<i>Here we go</i>

792
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,599
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

793
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:25,810
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

794
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:28,270
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

795
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:30,022
<i>Louder</i>

796
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:32,191
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

797
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:34,401
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

798
00:44:34,777 --> 00:44:36,737
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

799
00:44:36,904 --> 00:44:39,198
<i>Give me one, two, three, four</i>

800
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:43,619
<i>You wanted it, you went for it
And, baby, you got it</i>

801
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:48,332
<i>I wanted it, I went for it
And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

802
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:54,964
<i>Did it on my own</i>

803
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,802
<i>Own
Did it on my own</i>

804
00:45:01,136 --> 00:45:02,888
- Let's go.
- Yeah!

805
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:10,980
<i>Did it on my...</i>

806
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:13,399
<i>- Oh, no, it's falling!
- Grab it!</i>

807
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:38,966
Yeah, dude, let's go!
Push it, dude! Come on!

808
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:40,718
Come on, new guy,
just keep on going!

809
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:46,557
Come on, guys, keep going.

810
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:59,236
Check out Number 12.
He's got delts for days.

811
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,281
Forget that. I need lunch.
I'm starting to black out!

812
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:04,325
I think I'm getting
carpal tunnel.

813
00:46:04,491 --> 00:46:05,784
No pain, no gain, Priya.

814
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:07,202
Come on, chop-chop!
Five, 10...

815
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:08,537
Girl, relax.

816
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:10,080
Yeah. We're doing our best.

817
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:11,415
It's not enough!

818
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,750
The concert's this Saturday

819
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,293
and we're still
a hundred short!

820
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,961
I knew
we should have charged

821
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:17,463
more for photos!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

822
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,090
Mei, breathe. It's in the bag.

823
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:21,425
But...

824
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:23,302
What's the point
of getting to the concert

825
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:25,095
if you're too exhausted
to enjoy it?

826
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:28,432
Now, take a break and help me
appreciate some boys.

827
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,100
Okay, okay, okay.

828
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:32,895
Hey, what's up?

829
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:34,563
- Mei!
- Hey, Mei, what up?

830
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:37,024
- Looking good!
- Nice calves!

831
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:40,277
Are you a triangle?
'Cause you acute!

832
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:43,238
You guys are so weird.

833
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:45,574
- Hey!
- Are you spying on us?

834
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:46,909
I wanna talk to you, Lee.

835
00:46:46,992 --> 00:46:48,035
- Forget it.
- Fine.

836
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:50,788
Wonder if your mom knows
her precious little Mei-Mei

837
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:52,831
has been flaunting the panda
all over school.

838
00:46:56,835 --> 00:46:58,504
That's none of your business!

839
00:46:58,837 --> 00:47:00,965
One more step and
I'm telling her everything.

840
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:04,551
Now, put that thing away
and hear me out.

841
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,429
What do you want?

842
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:12,685
I wanna throw a sick
birthday party. An epic one.

843
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:17,064
It's this Friday.

844
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:18,857
If you're there,
everyone will come.

845
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:20,359
Simple as that.

846
00:47:20,526 --> 00:47:21,694
A party?

847
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:25,948
Look, I've done you a favor
keeping my mouth shut.

848
00:47:26,115 --> 00:47:27,992
All I'm asking for
is one back.

849
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,036
Hmm.

850
00:47:31,537 --> 00:47:33,914
I'll do it.

851
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:36,125
But it'll cost you one...

852
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,835
No. Two hundred bucks.

853
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,961
Okay.

854
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:41,171
Uh, hold, please.

855
00:47:42,214 --> 00:47:44,299
Are you serious?
You can't trust him.

856
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:45,467
It's a trap!

857
00:47:45,634 --> 00:47:47,219
This sounds like
a boy-girl party.

858
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:48,512
Are we allowed
to boy-girl parties?

859
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,932
Guys! Two hundred bucks
will put us over the top!

860
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:53,642
We have to do this.

861
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,769
We'll meet at Tyler's,
I'll do my thing,

862
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:57,646
and then we'll bounce.
Easy-peasy.

863
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:58,814
Dude, what about your mom?

864
00:47:58,939 --> 00:47:59,940
Forget my mom.

865
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:01,817
I'll be back before
she even knows I'm gone.

866
00:48:01,984 --> 00:48:03,360
- But...
- Hey, dorkbag.

867
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:06,280
We're in. But you only
get the panda for an hour.

868
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:09,158
And we are not
bringing any presents.

869
00:48:09,324 --> 00:48:10,534
Deal.

870
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,545
Okay, I'm heading off
to mathletes. See you later!

871
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:25,049
Wait, what about dinner?
I made all your favorites.

872
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,012
Thanks,
but Miriam's dad is, uh,

873
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:31,805
ordering pizza.
Save me leftovers?

874
00:48:31,972 --> 00:48:33,432
- What if I come with you?
- Wha...

875
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,642
What are you doing?
Linear equations? Geometry?

876
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:36,769
I have a double-jointed elbow!

877
00:48:36,935 --> 00:48:38,395
Look! I can make
a perfect circle!

878
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:42,441
Wow! Yeah, but it'll be
super boring.

879
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:45,569
Wouldn't you
rather hang with Dad?

880
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:46,862
Oh.

881
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:48,822
Let's get my flashcards.

882
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:49,990
- But...
- Hmm.

883
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:51,408
I was mathletes champ

884
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:52,534
- in grade 8, you know?
- Uh-huh.

885
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:55,329
They called me
the "Uncommon Denominator."

886
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:57,623
Cool. Oh, uh,
<i>Jade Palace</i> is on tonight.

887
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,999
- Can't miss that, right?
- Now, who's the weak link?

888
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,125
Priya and Abby
seem bright enough, but...

889
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,293
Oh, and traffic's a nightmare.

890
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:02,377
I can just
take the streetcar...

891
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:03,545
- you stay and rest.
- Miriam...

892
00:49:03,712 --> 00:49:05,005
I mean, she's a nice girl,

893
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:06,090
but maybe
she's slowing you down.

894
00:49:06,256 --> 00:49:08,050
Oh, Mom, you really
don't have to come.

895
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:09,885
Don't be silly.
We're already on the way.

896
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,554
But I don't want you to!

897
00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:21,146
Chop-chop, everyone.
Don't dawdle.

898
00:49:21,313 --> 00:49:22,314
Hurry up.

899
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:38,413
Oh! What...

900
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:40,582
Hey, cuz! Surprise!

901
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:42,876
Aunties?
What are you doing here?

902
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,336
The ritual, silly.

903
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:46,505
- She's lost weight.
- No, no, she gained weight.

904
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:48,173
- She looks like her mother.
- She looks like her father.

905
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,341
Ladies.

906
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,222
Mother.

907
00:49:57,057 --> 00:49:58,058
Hey, Grandma.

908
00:49:58,225 --> 00:49:59,226
Poor dear.

909
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:01,145
It must be so difficult

910
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:04,231
keeping that
unruly beast at bay.

911
00:50:04,773 --> 00:50:07,276
Your family is here now,
Mei-Mei.

912
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:10,154
And we will take care
of everything.

913
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:14,491
<i>Everybody clap your hands</i>

914
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:16,994
<i>Clap, clap, clap,
clap your hands</i>

915
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:20,873
<i>All right, now, we gonna do
the basic step...</i>

916
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:22,624
Where is she?

917
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,794
Who's up for some Boggle?

918
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:30,048
Eat. You need
your strength for the ritual.

919
00:50:30,174 --> 00:50:31,717
Thank you, aunties.

920
00:50:31,884 --> 00:50:34,011
Your hair is so thick,
like a pelt.

921
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:37,097
What a surprise
that you all came so early.

922
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:39,683
You need all the help
you can get, Ming.

923
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:42,477
So, Mei-Mei,
you've been managing

924
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,687
to keep the panda in?

925
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:46,607
- Yep. Totally.
- Really?

926
00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:47,774
What's that, Lily?

927
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:50,235
Well, it's a little hard
to believe

928
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,821
that Mei-Mei
could control such a beast.

929
00:50:52,988 --> 00:50:54,156
She's just a child.

930
00:50:54,323 --> 00:50:56,366
It's true.
And if Mei-Mei's panda

931
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,744
is anything like Ming's...

932
00:50:58,827 --> 00:50:59,995
Mei-Mei's better
than any of us

933
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:01,246
at controlling the panda.

934
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:05,167
She passed every trigger test.
Even the kitten box.

935
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:06,335
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness!

936
00:51:06,418 --> 00:51:07,461
- That's unbelievable.
- Impressive.

937
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:09,755
She just thinks
of my love for her,

938
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,090
and it gives her the strength
to stay calm.

939
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:14,259
Exactly.

940
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:15,928
- Aw.
- How sweet.

941
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:17,221
How sweet.

942
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:19,556
Anyway,
thanks for all the gifts,

943
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,600
but I think I'll go
to bed early.

944
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,101
Keeping that animal
locked down

945
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:24,686
sure takes a lot of energy.

946
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:26,396
Okay, sweetie. Get some rest.

947
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,481
Night, everyone.

948
00:51:27,606 --> 00:51:28,607
- Good night, Mei-Mei.
- Sleep well.

949
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,733
- Get some beauty rest.
- Get some rest.

950
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:38,825
Oh!

951
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,749
Mei-Mei, can I have a word
with you?

952
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,168
Uh, sure. What's up?

953
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:52,339
I found this.

954
00:51:53,048 --> 00:51:56,551
Strange for a girl
who hasn't let her panda out.

955
00:51:56,677 --> 00:51:57,803
It's, uh...

956
00:51:58,387 --> 00:51:59,513
It's not mine.

957
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:02,557
Mei-Mei,
I know what you're doing.

958
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:05,894
I know how hard it is
to keep the beast in.

959
00:52:06,061 --> 00:52:09,564
It feels so good
to let it out. So free.

960
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:14,653
But each time you do,
the stronger it gets.

961
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:17,364
And then you'll be
bound to it forever,

962
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:19,866
and the ritual will fail.

963
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,995
Has that ever happened?

964
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:25,414
It cannot happen.

965
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:32,004
Your mother and I
were close once,

966
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,549
but the red panda
took that away.

967
00:52:36,508 --> 00:52:39,636
I couldn't bear to see
that happen to you.

968
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:43,015
So, no more panda.

969
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:49,062
You are your mother's
whole world, Mei-Mei.

970
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:52,065
I know you'll do what's right.

971
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:56,820
Uh-uh. Mmm. Mmm!

972
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:58,613
- Uh, worm.
- Uh... Octopus!

973
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,699
- Spaghetti?
- Killer robot!

974
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:02,075
Mortality.

975
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:03,577
Hmm. Nice.

976
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,120
This sucks.

977
00:53:05,203 --> 00:53:07,080
- Let's bail.
- Just wait. She'll be here.

978
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:08,540
I knew she'd flake.

979
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:09,624
Panda girl!

980
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,626
- It's Mei!
- Thank Cthulhu.

981
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:13,587
Ugh. About time.

982
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:20,218
Yo! What up, peeps?

983
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:21,428
What are you wearing?

984
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:23,930
Hey, Tyler. Happy birthday.

985
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:29,019
I'm paying for the red panda,
not this garbage! Deal's off!

986
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:32,064
Wait! Can garbage do this?
Uh-huh.

987
00:53:32,147 --> 00:53:33,982
Or this? Stir the porridge.

988
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:37,069
Come on, guys!
Stir the porridge.

989
00:53:38,278 --> 00:53:40,280
Are you feeling okay?

990
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:42,783
Guys, it's hard
to explain, but just, hmm...

991
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:44,117
Just trust me on this.

992
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:45,911
I can't panda anymore.
I'm sorry.

993
00:53:46,078 --> 00:53:48,246
Okay, okay, okay. It's fine.

994
00:53:48,413 --> 00:53:49,623
You don't have to do it.

995
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:51,124
We'll just, uh,
figure something...

996
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:52,417
I won't go.

997
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:55,003
What? Priya, you can't not go.

998
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,797
Jesse's your soul mate.

999
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:57,964
But we only have enough

1000
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,591
- for three tickets.
- Then I'll stay home.

1001
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:01,676
Abby, no! I'll stay home.

1002
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:04,179
Guys, if we can't all go,

1003
00:54:04,346 --> 00:54:06,348
then none of us should go.

1004
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:07,891
Right?

1005
00:54:20,779 --> 00:54:22,656
Just one last time.

1006
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,282
Hey, Tyler!

1007
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:26,868
You want the panda?
You're getting the panda.

1008
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:29,871
Let's hear it
for the birthday boy!

1009
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:34,167
Yes!

1010
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:39,297
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler!

1011
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:41,133
- Go, go, go, Tyler!
- Yeah!

1012
00:54:41,299 --> 00:54:42,300
Okay!

1013
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:53,854
Yeah! Get it, girl!

1014
00:54:56,982 --> 00:54:59,067
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1015
00:54:59,234 --> 00:55:01,069
Oh, yeah!

1016
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,699
Faster! Faster! Whoo!

1017
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:07,826
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1018
00:55:07,993 --> 00:55:09,953
Yeah!

1019
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:12,372
You sure
the hotel's all right?

1020
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:14,291
It'll do.
At least breakfast is free.

1021
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,334
Get some rest. You look tired.

1022
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:17,711
Good night, cuz.
Try that tea.

1023
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:19,880
- Good night, Ming.
- Good night.

1024
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:24,885
Ming, this is a critical time.

1025
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:28,972
Mei-Mei needs a strong hand,
now more than ever.

1026
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:31,850
Don't let her
out of your sight.

1027
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:33,268
I won't, Mother.

1028
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:57,709
Hmm. Oh.

1029
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:02,923
Oh.

1030
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:04,591
Oh, no.

1031
00:56:09,221 --> 00:56:11,640
"Fur baby"?

1032
00:56:11,723 --> 00:56:12,891
Oh!

1033
00:56:13,767 --> 00:56:14,768
What?

1034
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:23,485
What...

1035
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,531
Mei-Mei. What is all...

1036
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:37,290
Yeah! We did it!
We are seeing 4-Town!

1037
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:38,458
- Whoo!
- Yes.

1038
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:41,670
Hey,
has anyone seen Mei?

1039
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:47,133
Dang. He is working you.

1040
00:56:47,259 --> 00:56:48,552
What a diva!

1041
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,720
It'll all be worth it.

1042
00:56:54,516 --> 00:56:58,061
Tomorrow, we are walking
into that concert girls

1043
00:56:58,228 --> 00:57:01,106
and coming out women.

1044
00:57:01,815 --> 00:57:03,525
Literally goosebumps.

1045
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,236
Hmm. What do you think
Jesse smells like?

1046
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:08,863
Milk chocolate and wet rocks.

1047
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,031
Wow!

1048
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:11,199
So manly.

1049
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:12,284
Oh, yes!

1050
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:14,244
It's happening,
Robaire Junior!

1051
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:15,829
You're finally gonna
meet your daddy!

1052
00:57:15,996 --> 00:57:17,539
And your hot uncles!

1053
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:20,166
What? It's true.

1054
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:25,630
Mei, what if you
didn't do the ritual?

1055
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:28,258
What if you kept the panda?

1056
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:30,260
- What?
- Look at you!

1057
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:32,012
You're not the same
feather-dustin',

1058
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:33,096
straight-A, goody-goody...

1059
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:34,764
Who we never saw, like, ever.

1060
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,725
- Yeah.
- You're such a rebel now.

1061
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:39,394
Guys, I can't be
like this forever.

1062
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:41,396
My whole family would freak.

1063
00:57:41,563 --> 00:57:43,356
Especially my mom.

1064
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:47,235
All her hopes and dreams
are pinned on me.

1065
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:50,405
I know.
But you've really changed

1066
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:52,365
and I'm proud of you.

1067
00:57:52,866 --> 00:57:55,785
Just don't get rid
of all of it, you know?

1068
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:57,370
Yeah. If it weren't for you,

1069
00:57:57,454 --> 00:57:58,872
none of this
would be happening.

1070
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,416
- You the bomb!
- Word. You da bomb, Mei.

1071
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:02,792
No, you da bomb.

1072
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:04,002
We all da bomb!

1073
00:58:04,169 --> 00:58:06,546
Yes. Yes. Yes!

1074
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:07,797
We da bomb!

1075
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:09,591
4-Town, here we come!
- - Robaire, I love you!

1076
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:11,801
We're coming for you!
We are women!

1077
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:13,637
- We are women!
- We are hot!

1078
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:17,182
<i>All right,
homies, next up is 4-Town.</i>

1079
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:20,018
<i>The boys are coming
to Toronto on the 25th!</i>

1080
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:21,603
<i>So get your tickets now.</i>

1081
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,897
<i>And check it, they'll be
cranking open the SkyDome</i>

1082
00:58:24,064 --> 00:58:25,523
<i>and performing under
a red lunar eclipse.</i>

1083
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:26,650
<i>It's gonna be galactic,
for sure.</i>

1084
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:27,984
Abby...

1085
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:31,655
you said the concert
was the 18th.

1086
00:58:31,821 --> 00:58:35,575
It is! He's wrong!
Look! The 18th, Toronto!

1087
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:37,327
Uh...

1088
00:58:37,452 --> 00:58:38,662
This says Toledo.

1089
00:58:38,787 --> 00:58:39,788
What?

1090
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,794
Toledo?

1091
00:58:45,919 --> 00:58:47,003
What the heck is Toledo?

1092
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,421
- Oh, no.
- What?

1093
00:58:48,588 --> 00:58:50,590
4-Town's the same night
as the ritual?

1094
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:51,841
No!

1095
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:53,134
The same night?

1096
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:55,887
The same night? What?

1097
00:58:56,054 --> 00:58:57,639
- Mei, chill.
- It's okay.

1098
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,182
No, it isn't!

1099
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:02,769
I can't miss 4-Town!
We worked so hard!

1100
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:06,356
But the ritual.
I'll let everyone down!

1101
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:09,150
- No, no, no!
- Hey, Panda Girl.

1102
00:59:10,652 --> 00:59:13,029
What are you doing?
We want more rides.

1103
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:14,989
Buzz off, jerkface. I'm busy.

1104
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:16,408
Oh, snap!

1105
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:17,909
You gonna take that, Tyler?

1106
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:19,369
You want your money?

1107
00:59:19,452 --> 00:59:21,121
Then get your butt
down here now!

1108
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:23,123
Forget your money,
and forget you!

1109
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:24,666
Mei! Let's just go.

1110
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:25,792
What about our deal?

1111
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:26,960
Shove your deal!

1112
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,586
Fine! Get out of here!

1113
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:30,505
Go back to your psycho mom

1114
00:59:30,588 --> 00:59:32,924
and your creepy temple,
you freak!

1115
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:35,051
Mei, no!

1116
00:59:35,176 --> 00:59:37,137
Take it back!

1117
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:38,304
Don't talk about my family
like that!

1118
00:59:38,471 --> 00:59:39,472
- You're hurting him!
- Mei!

1119
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:41,182
- Mei-Mei, stop!
- I hate you! I hate...

1120
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:43,226
What is going on here?

1121
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:46,896
I'm sorry.

1122
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:49,899
Just get off of me. Please.

1123
00:59:56,656 --> 00:59:57,907
I cannot believe

1124
00:59:57,991 --> 00:59:58,992
you would
let your daughter do this!

1125
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:00,702
Do you understand
what she did to my boy?

1126
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:01,953
I am so sorry.

1127
01:00:02,162 --> 01:00:04,456
She's never done
anything like this before.

1128
01:00:04,622 --> 01:00:05,707
I don't know
what came over her.

1129
01:00:05,874 --> 01:00:07,584
I don't want to hear
your apologies, okay?

1130
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:09,794
- I'm sorry again.
- She is an animal!

1131
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:12,922
All right, party's over!
Everyone, go home!

1132
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:28,521
I can't believe you girls
would use her like this!

1133
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:29,689
- What?
- But we didn't.

1134
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:30,774
No, we'd never.

1135
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,859
- What?
- I knew you were trouble.

1136
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:34,027
Putting all these thoughts

1137
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,321
into Mei-Mei's head,
parading her around.

1138
01:00:36,488 --> 01:00:38,656
Now she's lying, sneaking out.

1139
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:41,201
She attacked
a defenseless boy.

1140
01:00:41,493 --> 01:00:42,911
You think this is a joke?

1141
01:00:42,994 --> 01:00:44,746
Do you know
how dangerous this is?

1142
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:48,249
We didn't mean to,
we just wanted to see 4-Town.

1143
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,877
4-Town! You manipulated her

1144
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,545
for a bunch
of tacky delinquents?

1145
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:55,006
- No! She wanted to...
- Don't you blame her.

1146
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:56,591
She is a good girl,

1147
01:00:56,674 --> 01:00:58,218
and you've taken
advantage of her.

1148
01:00:58,593 --> 01:00:59,928
Mei, tell her.

1149
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:09,437
- What?
- Dude!

1150
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:12,565
Come on, Mei-Mei.

1151
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:14,567
Let's go.

1152
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:03,408
Will call that way.

1153
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:07,245
All righty,
general admission, eh?

1154
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:08,454
How many tickets?

1155
01:02:11,499 --> 01:02:12,500
Three, please.

1156
01:02:15,587 --> 01:02:17,422
What is that?

1157
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:20,592
Um, I think it's coming
from the SkyDome, Mother.

1158
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:22,719
Four is the worst number.

1159
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:24,637
You know,
Vivian was due on the fourth,

1160
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:26,180
but I held her
in until the fifth...

1161
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:27,348
Quiet, Lily.

1162
01:02:27,432 --> 01:02:28,433
Hurry up, everyone.

1163
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:30,435
It's almost time
to start the ritual.

1164
01:02:30,602 --> 01:02:31,895
Nervous, Mei-Mei?

1165
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:33,771
- A little.
- Oh, well,

1166
01:02:33,855 --> 01:02:37,901
I've got 50 years' experience
as a shaman.

1167
01:02:38,026 --> 01:02:40,278
This will be a piece of cake.

1168
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:42,906
And mostly painless.

1169
01:02:43,031 --> 01:02:45,033
Thanks, Mr. Gao.

1170
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,367
Wait, "mostly"?

1171
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:51,456
Long ago, the spirits
blessed the women

1172
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:54,500
of our family
with a great challenge.

1173
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:57,253
Mei-Mei, tonight is your turn.

1174
01:02:57,879 --> 01:02:59,881
Like all the women
around this table,

1175
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:02,675
you too will banish
the beast within

1176
01:03:02,842 --> 01:03:05,762
and finally become
your true self.

1177
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:09,599
May Sun Yee guide you
and keep you safe.

1178
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:10,808
- Hear, hear!
- That's right.

1179
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:11,893
Don't blow it.

1180
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:16,481
Uh... It's almost time.

1181
01:03:16,648 --> 01:03:18,858
The red moon
is about to begin.

1182
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:20,735
Mei-Mei, go get ready.

1183
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:22,111
Yes, Mother.

1184
01:03:22,654 --> 01:03:24,572
Oh, where are the instruments?

1185
01:03:26,074 --> 01:03:27,075
It's so amazing!

1186
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:31,496
- Hmm. Huh?
- Jin!

1187
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:32,956
- Help clear the table!
- Uh-huh.

1188
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,711
Uh...

1189
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:40,797
Oh!

1190
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:42,590
<i>Is it on?</i>

1191
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:45,259
<i>4-Town, here we come!</i>

1192
01:03:45,343 --> 01:03:46,469
Huh.

1193
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:47,720
<i>That's so gross.</i>

1194
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:49,263
Hmm.

1195
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,560
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1196
01:04:03,736 --> 01:04:04,737
I hate you!

1197
01:04:10,576 --> 01:04:11,619
Come in.

1198
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,371
Hey, Dad.

1199
01:04:14,038 --> 01:04:15,289
I... I'm almost ready.

1200
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:16,749
Did you make this?

1201
01:04:19,252 --> 01:04:20,545
Here, I'll erase it.

1202
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:24,298
What? We were
just being stupid.

1203
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:29,220
The panda's dangerous,
outta control.

1204
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:32,974
Huh. You sound
like your mother.

1205
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:36,853
What has she told you
about her panda?

1206
01:04:36,978 --> 01:04:40,440
Nothing.
She won't talk about it.

1207
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:43,484
It was quite destructive.

1208
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:45,820
And big.

1209
01:04:46,946 --> 01:04:49,115
She almost took out
half the temple.

1210
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:50,992
You... You saw it?

1211
01:04:51,284 --> 01:04:52,452
Only once.

1212
01:04:52,618 --> 01:04:55,163
She and your grandma
had a terrible fight.

1213
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:56,914
Over what?

1214
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:02,712
Your grandma
didn't approve of me.

1215
01:05:03,296 --> 01:05:05,214
But you should've seen
your mom.

1216
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:08,593
She was incredible.

1217
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:13,056
But I'm a monster.

1218
01:05:15,183 --> 01:05:18,352
People have all kinds
of sides to them, Mei.

1219
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:22,023
And some sides are messy.

1220
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:26,652
The point isn't to push
the bad stuff away,

1221
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:30,782
it's to make room for it,
live with it.

1222
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:36,704
Mei, erase it if you want,
but this side of you...

1223
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:39,624
made me laugh.

1224
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,796
<i>Dude, you're crazy!</i>

1225
01:05:46,214 --> 01:05:47,256
<i>Come here!</i>

1226
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,301
Mei-Mei.

1227
01:05:52,553 --> 01:05:53,554
It's time.

1228
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:07,693
Just follow my directions
and breathe.

1229
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:17,245
Now don't move
from the circle.

1230
01:06:17,328 --> 01:06:18,538
You understand?

1231
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:20,832
For as long
as the red moon shines,

1232
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:24,043
the astral realm will be open.

1233
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:27,088
And this circle is the door.

1234
01:06:43,312 --> 01:06:44,397
What are they saying?

1235
01:06:44,564 --> 01:06:48,693
The door will open only if we
sing from our hearts.

1236
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,405
It doesn't matter what.
I like Tony Bennett,

1237
01:06:52,572 --> 01:06:55,783
but your grandma, uh,
she's from old school.

1238
01:06:56,409 --> 01:06:59,328
Now, focus on their voices.

1239
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:01,497
Let them guide you.

1240
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:10,089
Oh, Sun Yee, revered ancestor,

1241
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:11,841
hear us now.

1242
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:20,224
Guide this girl
through her inner storm.

1243
01:07:28,441 --> 01:07:29,775
Louder! Louder!

1244
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:40,286
And return
the red panda spirit

1245
01:07:40,453 --> 01:07:41,829
from where it came!

1246
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:21,786
Sun Yee.

1247
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:21,012
You can do it. Keep going!

1248
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,782
No!

1249
01:09:54,378 --> 01:09:55,546
What happened?

1250
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:56,839
- What was that?
- Mei-Mei...

1251
01:09:56,922 --> 01:09:57,923
Is everyone okay?

1252
01:09:58,049 --> 01:09:59,091
Oh, my goodness,
I can't...

1253
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:00,176
Mei-Mei.

1254
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,553
It's okay. We can do it again.

1255
01:10:04,055 --> 01:10:05,056
Mei-Mei?

1256
01:10:06,307 --> 01:10:07,308
I'm keeping it.

1257
01:10:07,475 --> 01:10:08,642
- What did she say?
- Keeping it?

1258
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,061
I'm keeping it!

1259
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:11,228
- Oh, no!
- Mei-Mei!

1260
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:12,313
Stop her!

1261
01:10:12,438 --> 01:10:13,439
- What are you doing?
- Stop, Mei-Mei!

1262
01:10:13,522 --> 01:10:14,774
- Don't let her go!
- No!

1263
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,776
- Let go!
- What has come over you?

1264
01:10:16,942 --> 01:10:18,569
Stop!
Get a hold of her!

1265
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:20,571
- Mei-Mei! Stop!
- Don't do this!

1266
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:22,740
Mei-Mei!

1267
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:23,908
No!

1268
01:10:24,992 --> 01:10:26,660
I'm going to the concert!

1269
01:10:27,578 --> 01:10:29,455
- Get back here!
- Mei-Mei! Stop!

1270
01:10:29,622 --> 01:10:31,290
- A concert?
- No!

1271
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,877
This is a disaster.

1272
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,629
Unbelievable. Ming!

1273
01:10:36,796 --> 01:10:37,880
Too good to be true.

1274
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:39,465
How could you let this happen?

1275
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:41,801
She's out of control!

1276
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:44,178
Ming, it's okay.

1277
01:10:44,345 --> 01:10:45,388
Ming! Ming!
Answer me!

1278
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:46,472
What are we going to do
about this?

1279
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:48,557
How could she?

1280
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:53,562
How could she do this to...

1281
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,940
her own mother?

1282
01:11:06,826 --> 01:11:08,077
Ming?

1283
01:11:09,578 --> 01:11:11,455
Mei-Mei!

1284
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:16,794
Excuse me!

1285
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:45,614
Whoo! Yeah!

1286
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:48,242
4-Town!

1287
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:53,080
- Mei!
- Mei!

1288
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:54,874
- You're here!
- What are you doing here?

1289
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,668
I couldn't do it.

1290
01:11:57,835 --> 01:12:01,338
The panda's a part of me,
and you guys are too.

1291
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:04,091
Mei, you threw us
under the bus.

1292
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,135
I know and I'm sorry.

1293
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:07,470
I've been, like, obsessed

1294
01:12:07,553 --> 01:12:09,221
with my mom's approval
my whole life.

1295
01:12:09,388 --> 01:12:11,724
I couldn't take losing it,

1296
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:15,186
but losing you guys
feels even worse.

1297
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:17,396
Well, too bad.

1298
01:12:18,063 --> 01:12:19,398
'Cause you did.

1299
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,361
Robaire Junior?

1300
01:12:24,528 --> 01:12:26,030
She's been
taking care of him 24/7.

1301
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:27,156
No.

1302
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:28,324
And singing him lullabies
every night!

1303
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:30,409
No, no, no, I haven't.

1304
01:12:30,576 --> 01:12:32,119
They're lying.

1305
01:12:32,203 --> 01:12:33,954
Here.

1306
01:12:34,038 --> 01:12:35,372
Found him at Tyler's.

1307
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:42,296
4-Town forever?

1308
01:12:44,423 --> 01:12:46,258
4-Town forever.

1309
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:48,719
- 4-Town forever.
- 4-Town forever!

1310
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,721
Tyler?

1311
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:54,016
No! Tyler? Who's Tyler?
I don't know a...

1312
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:56,977
You are a 4-Townie?

1313
01:12:57,978 --> 01:12:58,979
No! Stop!

1314
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:00,147
- No way!
- Yeah!

1315
01:13:00,272 --> 01:13:01,398
Welcome to the sisterhood!

1316
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:02,650
Whatever, dorks.

1317
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:03,943
Cut it out!

1318
01:13:04,109 --> 01:13:05,528
Your mom
must have gone nuclear.

1319
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:07,404
Who cares?
What's she gonna do?

1320
01:13:07,488 --> 01:13:08,572
Ground me?

1321
01:13:12,368 --> 01:13:15,621
4-Town! 4-Town! 4-Town!

1322
01:13:15,788 --> 01:13:17,289
4-Town! 4-Town!

1323
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:23,671
Let's go!

1324
01:13:23,754 --> 01:13:25,047
Is it starting? It's starting!

1325
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:26,215
Guys, hold me.

1326
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:31,470
Four, three, two, one!

1327
01:13:33,556 --> 01:13:35,683
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1328
01:13:38,602 --> 01:13:39,812
Oh, my gosh!

1329
01:13:40,688 --> 01:13:42,398
Yeah! Z!

1330
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:43,774
I love you, man!

1331
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:46,318
Yeah! Yeah!

1332
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,282
Yes! Jesse!

1333
01:13:52,449 --> 01:13:55,786
<i>Toronto! Who knows what's up?</i>

1334
01:13:58,372 --> 01:13:59,748
Yes!

1335
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:04,587
<i>You want it?</i>

1336
01:14:04,753 --> 01:14:05,754
<i>I want it</i>

1337
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:07,923
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

1338
01:14:08,215 --> 01:14:10,092
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

1339
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:12,595
<i>Give me one, two, three, four</i>

1340
01:14:13,178 --> 01:14:15,055
<i>You wanted it
You went for it</i>

1341
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:16,307
<i>And, baby, you got it</i>

1342
01:14:17,516 --> 01:14:19,101
<i>I wanted it
I went for it</i>

1343
01:14:20,477 --> 01:14:24,857
<i>And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

1344
01:14:25,024 --> 01:14:29,987
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1345
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:33,115
<i>Own</i>

1346
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:34,283
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1347
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:36,118
Mei-Mei!

1348
01:14:41,915 --> 01:14:42,916
No way!

1349
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:45,044
Is this part of the show?

1350
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:49,340
Is this special effects?

1351
01:14:49,923 --> 01:14:50,924
Help! Help!

1352
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:53,260
Mei-Mei!

1353
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:56,430
Where are you?

1354
01:14:58,223 --> 01:14:59,224
Mom?

1355
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:00,893
Mei-Mei!

1356
01:15:08,025 --> 01:15:09,777
- I want a refund.
- What's her problem?

1357
01:15:09,943 --> 01:15:11,445
Mei!

1358
01:15:18,952 --> 01:15:20,245
It was just getting good!

1359
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:21,497
This isn't cool.

1360
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,418
- Mei! Mei!
- Dad?

1361
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:27,795
We have to save your mother!

1362
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:29,046
She's gone loco!

1363
01:15:29,213 --> 01:15:31,173
Mei, we have to do
the ritual again.

1364
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,008
What happened? She's huge!

1365
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:34,385
I told you she was big!

1366
01:15:34,593 --> 01:15:35,719
That big?

1367
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:37,763
Mei-Mei!

1368
01:15:37,846 --> 01:15:39,014
Ming!
She's your daughter!

1369
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:40,182
Mei!

1370
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:41,475
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her!

1371
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:45,020
You are in big trouble,
young lady!

1372
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:46,188
Mom! Let go!

1373
01:15:46,313 --> 01:15:48,357
I'm shutting this down,

1374
01:15:48,524 --> 01:15:50,192
right now!

1375
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:53,612
Everyone, go home!

1376
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:55,239
Where are your parents?

1377
01:15:55,406 --> 01:15:57,157
Put some clothes on!

1378
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:02,746
This isn't you!

1379
01:16:03,872 --> 01:16:05,708
This is me!

1380
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,048
- Mei-Mei!
- Mei! Are you hurt?

1381
01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,677
I'm not your little
Mei-Mei anymore!

1382
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:18,804
I lied, Mom!

1383
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:19,972
What?

1384
01:16:20,139 --> 01:16:22,516
It was my idea
to hustle the panda.

1385
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:25,310
My idea
to go to Tyler's party!

1386
01:16:25,477 --> 01:16:27,646
It was all me!

1387
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:29,273
I like boys!

1388
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,233
I like loud music!

1389
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,360
I like gyrating!

1390
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:35,988
I'm 13! Deal with it!

1391
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:49,334
The ritual.
Everyone in position.

1392
01:16:49,793 --> 01:16:51,378
Mei-Mei, keep her busy.

1393
01:16:51,545 --> 01:16:53,088
Oh, I'll keep her busy.

1394
01:16:53,839 --> 01:16:55,716
Where's Jin? Jin!

1395
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:59,678
Mei!
Keep her in the circle!

1396
01:16:59,845 --> 01:17:01,764
Get back here!

1397
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,265
Make me!

1398
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:05,684
You think
you're so mature!

1399
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:07,561
Lying to me!

1400
01:17:08,437 --> 01:17:10,063
Blaming me!

1401
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:13,400
How could you be so, so...

1402
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:15,277
crass?

1403
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,155
Oh!
That's nothing!

1404
01:17:18,322 --> 01:17:20,073
You wanna see crass?

1405
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,660
- What are you doing?
- You like that? Yes!

1406
01:17:23,827 --> 01:17:25,662
- Stop moving like that!
- What's wrong?

1407
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:27,539
- Is this bothering you?
- Stop it!

1408
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:28,874
Yeah, Mei!

1409
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:30,834
Destroy her
with your big butt!

1410
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:32,169
Yeah! Go, go, go!

1411
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:34,338
Start singing now!

1412
01:17:34,505 --> 01:17:35,547
Ladies!

1413
01:17:38,509 --> 01:17:41,053
Stop!

1414
01:17:42,888 --> 01:17:43,931
Sing louder!

1415
01:17:44,097 --> 01:17:45,349
We're trying.

1416
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:47,768
- Stop it!
- Let's get out of here!

1417
01:17:47,893 --> 01:17:49,144
Come on!

1418
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:50,979
- Huh? Take it, Mom! Take it!
- No!

1419
01:17:52,564 --> 01:17:55,567
Stop it! Stop!

1420
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:03,283
All I wanted...

1421
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:07,162
...was to go to a concert!

1422
01:18:08,372 --> 01:18:10,791
I never went to concerts!

1423
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,377
I put my family first!

1424
01:18:13,544 --> 01:18:15,838
I tried to be a good daughter!

1425
01:18:19,091 --> 01:18:21,051
Well, sorry I'm not perfect!

1426
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,345
Sorry I'm not good enough!

1427
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:27,307
And sorry
I'll never be like you!

1428
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:44,032
Oh, no!

1429
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,034
Mom... Mom!

1430
01:18:55,794 --> 01:18:56,920
No!

1431
01:19:00,507 --> 01:19:03,886
Mom!
You have to get in the circle!

1432
01:19:05,888 --> 01:19:07,180
Wake up!

1433
01:19:08,974 --> 01:19:10,225
I'm sorry!

1434
01:19:11,143 --> 01:19:13,061
Mom? Come on.

1435
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:14,897
Please!

1436
01:19:21,987 --> 01:19:24,281
Sun Yee, give me strength.

1437
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:38,086
- Pull, Mei-Mei!
- Grandma?

1438
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,505
I am not losing my daughter.

1439
01:19:40,672 --> 01:19:41,965
Don't just stand there!

1440
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:00,901
Make room
for your elders, Mei-Mei!

1441
01:20:00,984 --> 01:20:02,736
- What?
- We're with you!

1442
01:20:02,903 --> 01:20:04,571
But what are you doing?
What if you can't turn back?

1443
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:06,490
- Your mom needs us!
- She's family!

1444
01:20:06,657 --> 01:20:08,450
Less talking, more pulling!

1445
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:11,203
- This fur is so itchy!
- Quiet, Lily!

1446
01:20:23,173 --> 01:20:24,341
Louder!

1447
01:20:24,508 --> 01:20:26,134
Sing from the heart!

1448
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:28,595
Louder!
The circle isn't working!

1449
01:20:39,064 --> 01:20:41,942
<i>- Never met nobody
- Nobody</i>

1450
01:20:43,485 --> 01:20:44,736
<i>Never met, never met,
never met</i>

1451
01:20:44,903 --> 01:20:49,032
<i>Like</i>

1452
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,743
<i>You</i>

1453
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:01,712
<i>Get up</i>

1454
01:21:01,878 --> 01:21:04,339
<i>I never met nobody</i>

1455
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:06,008
<i>Like you</i>

1456
01:21:07,342 --> 01:21:09,011
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

1457
01:21:09,302 --> 01:21:10,679
<i>It's true</i>

1458
01:21:10,762 --> 01:21:15,017
<i>But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do</i>

1459
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:19,438
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1460
01:21:20,188 --> 01:21:24,651
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1461
01:21:24,818 --> 01:21:28,989
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

1462
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:33,618
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

1463
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:36,705
<i>I'll never not be
your ride or die</i>

1464
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:40,292
<i>All right!</i>

1465
01:21:44,129 --> 01:21:45,589
Huh?

1466
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:49,134
Mom? Mom!

1467
01:22:02,522 --> 01:22:05,567
Mom? Are you okay?
We have to...

1468
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:08,320
Mom?

1469
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,491
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

1470
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:17,037
What happened?

1471
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:19,915
I... I hurt her.

1472
01:22:20,957 --> 01:22:21,958
Who?

1473
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,251
My mom!

1474
01:22:23,835 --> 01:22:27,756
I got so angry,
and I lost control.

1475
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:31,968
I'm just so sick
of being perfect!

1476
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:34,429
I'm never gonna be
good enough for her.

1477
01:22:35,347 --> 01:22:36,640
Or anyone.

1478
01:22:49,986 --> 01:22:52,030
I know it feels that way.

1479
01:22:52,197 --> 01:22:54,449
Like, all the time.

1480
01:22:55,617 --> 01:22:59,955
But... it isn't true.

1481
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:06,586
Come on.

1482
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:38,785
Really? I could explode
at any moment.

1483
01:23:38,952 --> 01:23:40,162
- We have to find them.
- Where are they?

1484
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:42,664
- Finally.
- Hurry, hurry!

1485
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:43,915
Where have you been?
Come on!

1486
01:23:44,082 --> 01:23:46,251
- Let's get the lead out!
- Ladies.

1487
01:23:56,928 --> 01:23:59,598
- I'm sorry.
- Shh!

1488
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:02,267
You don't have to apologize.

1489
01:24:04,686 --> 01:24:06,229
I'm your mother.

1490
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:15,989
May Sun Yee guide you
and keep you safe.

1491
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:19,576
One at a time, ladies.
And quickly.

1492
01:24:21,745 --> 01:24:22,746
That's it?

1493
01:24:22,913 --> 01:24:24,456
Mei-Mei's keeping the panda?

1494
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:27,709
It's her life. Now move.

1495
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:53,235
Go ahead. It's okay.

1496
01:25:15,465 --> 01:25:16,466
No.

1497
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:20,178
Mei-Mei, please.
Just come with me.

1498
01:25:21,846 --> 01:25:24,391
I'm changing, Mom.

1499
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:28,436
I'm finally figuring out
who I am.

1500
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:32,732
But...

1501
01:25:32,941 --> 01:25:35,694
I'm scared it'll take me away
from you.

1502
01:25:38,363 --> 01:25:39,447
Me too.

1503
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,076
I see you, Mei-Mei.

1504
01:25:43,827 --> 01:25:46,121
You try to make
everyone happy,

1505
01:25:46,204 --> 01:25:48,415
but are so hard on yourself.

1506
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:51,293
And if I taught you that...

1507
01:25:53,712 --> 01:25:54,754
I'm sorry.

1508
01:25:56,715 --> 01:25:58,675
So, don't hold back.

1509
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:00,635
For anyone.

1510
01:26:05,348 --> 01:26:07,100
The farther you go,

1511
01:26:07,892 --> 01:26:09,561
the prouder I'll be.

1512
01:26:27,954 --> 01:26:31,708
I'm not going
to regret this, am I?

1513
01:27:00,195 --> 01:27:03,865
<i>I'm Meilin Lee,
and ever since I turned 13,</i>

1514
01:27:04,032 --> 01:27:07,410
<i>life's been a lot.</i>

1515
01:27:07,577 --> 01:27:11,331
<i>People still talk about
Pandapocalypse 2002.</i>

1516
01:27:12,207 --> 01:27:14,292
<i>Mom and I just call it...</i>

1517
01:27:14,459 --> 01:27:15,585
<i>growing pains.</i>

1518
01:27:17,962 --> 01:27:20,382
This thing's hungry
all the time.

1519
01:27:20,548 --> 01:27:22,425
Eat up, little one.
Oh, you're so hungry.

1520
01:27:22,592 --> 01:27:24,177
- Munch, munch, munch.
- What?

1521
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,554
Mr. Gao had to put
her panda in something.

1522
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:28,223
You should see Grandma's.

1523
01:27:28,348 --> 01:27:31,851
Hmph! So unlucky.

1524
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:37,440
You ready?

1525
01:27:37,607 --> 01:27:38,691
Let's do this.

1526
01:27:39,192 --> 01:27:41,403
- Hello! Welcome to our temple!
- What up, Toronto!

1527
01:27:41,569 --> 01:27:42,779
- Get in here!
- Yes, come on in.

1528
01:27:42,946 --> 01:27:45,323
And things at the temple
have never been better.

1529
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:47,534
O-M-G! That looks so cute!

1530
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,453
Our temple
is the oldest in Toronto.

1531
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:54,499
And the only one that's home
to the great red panda.

1532
01:27:58,211 --> 01:27:59,295
Say "bamboo leaves!"

1533
01:27:59,462 --> 01:28:01,256
- Bamboo leaves!
- Mei!

1534
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:02,715
- Hey!
- Guys!

1535
01:28:02,882 --> 01:28:04,175
- What's up?
- Bring it in!

1536
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,136
Ready to get your karaoke on?

1537
01:28:06,302 --> 01:28:07,429
Totally.

1538
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,889
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!

1539
01:28:10,056 --> 01:28:12,809
Hold on. You're not
going out like that, are you?

1540
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:15,145
My panda,
my choice, Mom.

1541
01:28:16,062 --> 01:28:18,731
I'll be back
before dinner, okay?

1542
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:20,984
Fine. Oh, um...

1543
01:28:21,067 --> 01:28:22,777
You're welcome to join us.

1544
01:28:22,902 --> 01:28:24,279
For Mr. Lee's cooking?

1545
01:28:24,362 --> 01:28:25,697
- Uh, yeah!
- We're so there.

1546
01:28:25,864 --> 01:28:27,157
Don't load up on junk.

1547
01:28:27,323 --> 01:28:28,867
Thanks for covering
for me, Dad.

1548
01:28:29,033 --> 01:28:30,493
Have fun!

1549
01:28:30,743 --> 01:28:33,163
And I'll beatbox.
And I can bleach my hair, too.

1550
01:28:33,538 --> 01:28:34,873
<i>And, yeah...</i>

1551
01:28:35,582 --> 01:28:38,293
<i>sometimes I miss
how things were,</i>

1552
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:41,671
<i>but nothing stays
the same forever.</i>

1553
01:28:41,838 --> 01:28:44,966
O-M-G! I'm so excited
for the new album.

1554
01:28:45,133 --> 01:28:47,385
<i>We've all got an inner beast.</i>

1555
01:28:47,552 --> 01:28:49,387
<i>We've all got
a messy, loud,</i>

1556
01:28:49,471 --> 01:28:52,640
<i>weird part of ourselves
hidden away.</i>

1557
01:28:52,807 --> 01:28:55,351
<i>And a lot of us
never let it out.</i>

1558
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,270
<i>But I did.</i>

1559
01:28:58,146 --> 01:29:00,064
<i>How about you?</i>

1560
01:29:04,068 --> 01:29:06,905
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1561
01:29:07,655 --> 01:29:12,076
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1562
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:15,788
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

1563
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:16,873
<i>It's true</i>

1564
01:29:16,956 --> 01:29:21,669
<i>But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do</i>

1565
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:26,216
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1566
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:31,221
<i>Yeah</i>

1567
01:29:35,475 --> 01:29:39,521
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1568
01:29:39,604 --> 01:29:44,317
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

1569
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,072
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

1570
01:29:49,155 --> 01:29:52,408
<i>I'll never not be your ride
or die</i>

1571
01:29:52,492 --> 01:29:53,826
<i>All right</i>

1572
01:29:54,869 --> 01:29:57,121
<i>Let's call it what it is
It's a masterpiece</i>

1573
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:59,832
<i>Got a whole lotta love
for them city streets</i>

1574
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:01,376
<i>Tonight is the place to be</i>

1575
01:30:01,459 --> 01:30:03,711
<i>Got a big boom box
and a new CD</i>

1576
01:30:03,795 --> 01:30:06,130
<i>- Come on!
- Everybody, let's tear it up</i>

1577
01:30:06,214 --> 01:30:08,550
<i>If you want mad skills
You can share with us</i>

1578
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:10,718
<i>Everybody just stop and stare</i>

1579
01:30:10,802 --> 01:30:13,346
<i>And you know why, it's me
Robaire</i>

1580
01:30:13,429 --> 01:30:14,514
<i>Woo!</i>

1581
01:30:15,682 --> 01:30:16,766
<i>Unh!</i>

1582
01:30:20,144 --> 01:30:21,271
<i>Let's go!</i>

1583
01:30:21,354 --> 01:30:25,692
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1584
01:30:25,775 --> 01:30:30,154
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

<i>I'll never not be your ride

1587
01:30:38,162 --> 01:30:39,581
<i>All right</i>

1588
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,376
<i>Like you</i>

1589
01:30:44,627 --> 01:30:45,628
<i>Like you</i>

1590
01:30:46,838 --> 01:30:47,839
<i>Like you</i>

01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:50,133
<i>Like you, like you</i>

01:30:57,807 --> 01:31:02,186
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1596
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,398
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

1597
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:06,566
<i>It's true</i>

1598
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:11,195
<i>But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do</i>

1599
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:15,908
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1600
01:31:18,494 --> 01:31:22,874
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1601
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:27,462
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

1602
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:31,966
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

1603
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:35,511
<i>I'll never not be your ride
or die</i>

1604
01:31:35,595 --> 01:31:36,679
<i>All right</i>

1605
01:31:40,767 --> 01:31:43,394
<i>Ooh</i>

1606
01:31:44,687 --> 01:31:46,981
<i>Yeah</i>

1607
01:31:48,691 --> 01:31:50,610
<i>Yeah</i>

1608
01:31:54,113 --> 01:31:57,533
<i>Heavy rain from my cloudy eye</i>

1609
01:31:57,617 --> 01:31:59,952
<i>Every time you say</i>

1610
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:03,706
<i>That it isn't why
I used to call you babe</i>

1611
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:06,834
<i>But you're the light
of my life</i>

1612
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:16,219
<i>I drove by your house
29 times today</i>

1613
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:24,435
<i>And nobody else
could make me feel this way</i>

1614
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:30,024
<i>Nobody else</i>

1615
01:32:32,985 --> 01:32:37,115
<i>Nobody else, nobody</i>

1616
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:42,078
<i>'Cause you've opened my eyes
and stolen my heart</i>

1617
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:46,082
<i>You make me believe
that love can be hard</i>

1618
01:32:46,165 --> 01:32:50,753
<i>And I can never survive
a minute apart</i>

1619
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:55,591
<i>You are my one true love</i>

1620
01:32:56,008 --> 01:32:59,804
<i>My one true love</i>

1621
01:33:00,012 --> 01:33:03,474
<i>My heaven above</i>

1622
01:33:03,975 --> 01:33:08,604
<i>My one true love</i>

1623
01:33:14,068 --> 01:33:17,780
<i>Heavy rain on a Saturday</i>

1624
01:33:17,864 --> 01:33:21,492
<i>When you said my name
in the saddest way</i>

1625
01:33:21,576 --> 01:33:23,786
<i>Nothing numbs the pain</i>

1626
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:27,665
<i>You're still the light
of my life</i>

1627
01:33:30,168 --> 01:33:36,090
<i>I drove by your house
10,000 times last year</i>

1628
01:33:38,342 --> 01:33:44,098
<i>Nobody else
wanted to dry my tears</i>

1629
01:33:45,016 --> 01:33:50,605
<i>Nobody else</i>

1630
01:33:52,857 --> 01:33:57,445
<i>Nobody else, nobody else</i>

1631
01:34:01,532 --> 01:34:06,204
<i>'Cause you've opened my eyes
and stolen my heart</i>

1632
01:34:06,287 --> 01:34:10,208
<i>You make me believe
that love can be hard</i>

1633
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:14,879
<i>And I can never survive
a minute apart</i>

1634
01:34:15,379 --> 01:34:20,134
<i>You are my one true love</i>

1635
01:34:20,218 --> 01:34:24,222
<i>My one true love</i>

1636
01:34:24,305 --> 01:34:28,142
<i>My heaven above</i>

1637
01:34:28,226 --> 01:34:32,980
<i>My one true love</i>

1638
01:34:33,606 --> 01:34:35,525
<i>Yeah</i>

1639
01:34:36,901 --> 01:34:39,362
<i>Yeah</i>

1640
01:34:51,123 --> 01:34:53,793
<i>Nobody else</i>

1641
01:34:59,298 --> 01:35:01,092
<i>You know what's up</i>

1642
01:35:03,177 --> 01:35:05,054
<i>You know it's us, yeah</i>

1643
01:35:05,471 --> 01:35:07,431
<i>You wanted it, you went for it</i>

1644
01:35:07,515 --> 01:35:09,767
<i>- And baby, you got it
- You know what's up</i>

1645
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:11,686
<i>You wanted it, you went for it</i>

1646
01:35:11,769 --> 01:35:14,105
<i>You know it's us, yeah</i>

1647
01:35:14,188 --> 01:35:18,401
<i>I'm gonna make it all the way
Just watch me</i>

1648
01:35:18,484 --> 01:35:21,988
<i>I'm gonna hustle every day</i>

1649
01:35:22,071 --> 01:35:23,114
<i>Ooh-oh</i>

1650
01:35:23,197 --> 01:35:27,201
<i>I'm making paper
like it's origami</i>

1651
01:35:27,285 --> 01:35:31,831
<i>I only came to win the game
Can't stop me</i>

1652
01:35:31,914 --> 01:35:33,958
<i>You wanted it, you went for it</i>

1653
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,877
<i>And baby, you got it</i>

1654
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,087
<i>I wanted it, I went for it</i>

1655
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:43,092
<i>And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

1656
01:35:43,634 --> 01:35:47,513
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1657
01:35:48,848 --> 01:35:51,642
<i>Own</i>

1658
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:54,645
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1659
01:36:00,526 --> 01:36:02,153
<i>You know what's up</i>

1660
01:36:04,655 --> 01:36:06,282
<i>You know it's us, yeah</i>

1661
01:36:06,365 --> 01:36:09,702
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
listen up.</i>

1662
01:36:10,369 --> 01:36:12,038
<i>I'm gonna ask you
a few questions,</i>

1663
01:36:12,121 --> 01:36:13,831
<i>and I just want you
to be honest with me.</i>

1664
01:36:14,457 --> 01:36:15,833
<i>You want those shoes?</i>

1665
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:18,044
<i>You want that shirt?</i>

<i>You want that purse?</i>

1668
01:36:25,259 --> 01:36:27,428
<i>I'm gonna need you
to convince me.</i>

1669
01:36:28,638 --> 01:36:31,098
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>

<i>Gimme one, two, three, four...</i>

<i>You wanted it, you went for it
And baby, you got it</i>

1679

<i>I wanted it, I went for it
And baby, I did it on my own</i>
