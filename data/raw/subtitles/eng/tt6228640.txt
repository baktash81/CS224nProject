So, how's Kathy?

384
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,499
She's great.

385
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,792
She just won her first, uh,

386
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,082
barrel racing competition...

387
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,062

- take over my dad's company.

396
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:22,624
be CEO.

397
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
That's interesting.

398
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,625
I know!

399
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,104
So how's your, um, college

that you go to?

401
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,957
It's good, I guess.

Uh, I think I'm gonna major

00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:38,165
in social work...

404
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,000

who needs help.

410

- Jessica's getting arrested.
- What?

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,104
Ladies, I know that Miss Jessica

419
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,957
is probably a good friend...

00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,790
a really skilled thief.

Jessica our whole lives.

428

- like this.

519
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:03,290
just the solution...

520
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,707

No, silly.

sixty-three cents.

00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,729

526
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,832
to do with this?

527
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,875

550
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,165
the horses?

00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,896

- every morning...

562
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:19,958
- So there'll be plenty of time
- with the horses.

563
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:21,915
I'll just skip flag.

Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:55,957
fear of tractors?

756
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:59,082
Me? Nothin'.

757
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,875
My pop saw I was havin' trouble

758
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,665
with it.

759
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,166
He just scooped me up, sat me

760
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,665
down on the bench next to him...

761
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,083
- and, well, once I was up
- there...

762
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,167
I wasn't afraid of tractors

763
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:09,249
anymore.

764
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,542
Of course, I was just a little

765
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:13,832
kid at the time.

766
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,958
- I'm guessing you're a little
- too old...

767
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:20,749
To be hauled up onto a horse.

768
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,499
Yeah, my point is...

769
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,938
I couldn't have gotten on that

770
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:25,374
tractor by myself.

771
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,625
Seems to me there's plenty

772
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:27,874
of fine gals around here...

773
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,521
would be more than happy to help

774
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:31,166
you out if you were to ask 'em.

775
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,958
[JERRY] Come back anytime.

776
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,500
Guess it was somethin' I said?

777
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,750
SAM (V.O.) Hi, Gram!

778
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:50,124
It's me, Sam.

779
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,542
I bet you never thought I'd

780
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:52,957
write you a real letter, huh?

781
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,249
Say hi to Mom for me.

782
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,791
- Everything's been going
- so great...

783
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,540
This past week here at camp.

784
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,625
( MUSIC PLAYING )

785
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,083
Hey, Samantha, do you want

786
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:08,500
a turn?

787
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,708
- SAM (V.O.) I've made a ton
- of new friends.

788
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:16,624
You wouldn't believe it.

789
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,104
The counselors are real

790
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:19,582
understanding and nice.

791
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,583
One of them, Miss Jessica, got

792
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,582
engaged right here at camp.

793
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,707
Crazy, huh?

794
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,999
So what can I do you for?

795
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,875
- Well, uh, Mr. C, here's
- the thing.

796
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,082
Dave, call me Mike, please.

797
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,812
Of course. Uh, Mike, uh,

798
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:34,540
here's the thing.

799
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,916
Um, Jessica and I were

800
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,290
wondering if...

801
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,583
We'd like to have our

802
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,874
wedding here. Please?

803
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,000
Please, please, please, say yes.

804
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:44,124
This camp means so much to me.

805
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,583
I... of course, we can wait

806
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,040
until next summer...

807
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,958
and the foliage, and the end

808
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,874
of spring is so beautiful.

809
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,667
I just can't imagine

810
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,457
having it anywhere else.

811
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:57,332
This is a... a surprise.

812
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,958
- Well, uh, of course, you
- know, we would pay.

813
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:00,250
- And we would also provide
- our own crew...

814
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:01,624
For cleanup and for teardown.

815
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,125
- Oh, no, no. I wouldn't
- think of charging.

816
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,625
Jessica's like family. It would

817
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,124
be an honor and a privilege.

818
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:09,124
It's just...

819
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,958
Give me a little time to think

820
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,790
about it, okay?

821
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,875
But...

822
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:16,957
Uh, of course, of course.

823
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,832
Absolutely, um, yeah.

824
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,290
Just let us know.

825
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,583
- Okay.
- Thank you.

826
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:22,666
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

827
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,041
- SAM (V.O.) Everyone's
- been real excited...

828
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:35,750
- About the upcoming
- talent show.

829
00:36:35,753 --> 00:36:38,249
Girls, rest time's over.

830
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,458
Are you guys ready to have some

831
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,665
fun? What's going on?

832
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,979
Coco said that we had to do

833
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,290
a skit about flowers...

834
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,915
but I think that's dumb.

835
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:52,540
Wait, girls. Girls, girls.

836
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,750
I think you guys are

837
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:54,957
forgetting...

838
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,979
what the talent show is all

839
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,999
about... teamwork.

840
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,625
How well can you cooperate

841
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,249
and work together?

842
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,188
I mean that's what BR's

843
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,124
all about, right?

844
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,707
Right?

845
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,249
Yeah.

846
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,563
I know you guys will come up

847
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,874
with an amazing skit.

848
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,854
Now there's an afternoon of fun

849
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:15,832
waiting for you outside.

850
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,896
Are you guys ready?

851
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:17,957
Yeah! Yeah!

852
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,166
- Let's go! Come on,
- let's go and get it.

853
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:20,250
Let's have some fun.

854
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,332
Come on.

855
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,167
Thanks, Miss Lisa.

856
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:24,999
But I still want puppies.

857
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,583
SAM (V.O.) And of course,

858
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,165
there's the horses.

859
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,229
They're more beautiful

860
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,290
than I imagined.

861
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,375
They each have their own

862
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,457
personality.

863
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,708
And I spend as much time

864
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,957
as I can with them.

865
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,832
Well, gotta go.

866
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,979
It's almost time for flag,

867
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,124
and I can't miss that.

868
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,250
Trust me. Love you, Grams.

869
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:43,374
I'll write you again soon.

870
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,229
P.S... sorry about the goat

871
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,082
bites.

872
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,562
I had a little friend helping

873
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:50,041
me write this letter.

874
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:24,040
Hello, George, it's Mike.

875
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,416
Yeah, it's been a while.

876
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,791
That long, eh?

877
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,979
Yeah, I guess I was a little

878
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,749
abrupt.

879
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,646
Look, uh, that's what

880
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm callin' about.

881
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,625
Um, I figured I owed you at

882
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,707
least an advanced notice.

883
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,999
After this camp season...

884
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,792
I'm putting Black River Ranch

885
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,583
up for sale.

886
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,563
Uh, what I was thinkin' was,

887
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,124
what do you think about maybe...

888
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,542
you could keep it open

889
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,957
for a few more seasons?

890
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:59,604
I could, uh, either run it for

891
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:02,249
you, or I could train somebody.

892
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,313
Well, that's, uh, George,

893
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:08,374
we haven't had privates here...

894
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,957
since the big recession.

895
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,854
You know, uh, a lot of families

896
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:13,750
had to stop sendin' their kids.

897
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,938
Pays a lot of dividends,

898
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:22,000
just, uh, no money.

899
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,957
Uh, really, that fast?

900
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,479
No, uh, none of us is gettin'

901
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,999
any younger.

902
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,625
Uh, well, it would take

903
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:34,249
a little while to...

904
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,375
uh, place the horses in new

905
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:36,499
homes.

906
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,583
Uh-uh-huh.

907
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,896
What about the horses

908
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,665
that don't sell at auction?

909
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:47,125
Uh-huh.

910
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,208
- Oh, Mrs. C and I will
- be all right.

911
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:52,333
We got a little condo

912
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:53,457
down South.

913
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,625
No horses, though.

914
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, uh, why don't you,

915
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,207
uh, write up a draft...

916
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,207
and, uh, send it over.

917
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,666
Thanks.

918
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,041
Bulldozers.

919
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,375
Not what I'd envisioned

920
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,125
for Black River Ranch.

921
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,166
I pledge allegiance to the

922
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,665

the talent show is only

937
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:53,832
three days away.

938
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:54,957
Yeah?

939
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,540
So go have fun out there.

940
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,062
And, oh, here's another morning

All right, everyone.

1139
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:33,146
We have only two more acts left

1140
00:50:33,147 --> 00:50:34,665
before the judges decide.

1141
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,208
Who will earn the phone call

1142
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:37,749
home? Oh, I'm so excited!

1143
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,500
All right, let's give a big

1144
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,249
Black River cheer...

1145
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,188
for Team Awesome Sauce and their

1146
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:45,125
special guest, Miss Lisa.

1147
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,500
Hi, everyone!

1148
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:54,125
Say hello to Miss Lisa.

1149
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,229
You probably don't know this,

1150
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,415
but, when Miss Lisa wakes up...

1151
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,021
the first thing she likes

1152
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,625
to do is dance.

1153
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,542
After that, Miss Lisa has

1154
00:51:16,543 --> 00:51:17,958
to brush her teeth.

1155
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,583
Now Miss Lisa likes to

1156
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:48,125
put on her makeup.

1157
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,375
Oh, no!

1158
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,041
And a little blush.

1159
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,938
Of course, no day would

1160
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:25,749
be complete without breakfast.

1161
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,041
Whip cream!

1162
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:40,375
I just love it on my face.

1163
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:42,708
And my hair.

1164
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,958
Thank you!

1165
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,896
How about another round

1166
00:53:05,897 --> 00:53:07,250
for Team Awesome Sauce?

1167
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,790
Now last, but not least...

1168
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,396
let's give a big round

1169
00:53:14,397 --> 00:53:16,000
of applause for Team USA.

1170
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:23,208
( MUSIC PLAYING )

1171
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,750
- Now before we announce
- the winners...

1172
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:37,438
Please thank Samantha for such

1173
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:39,125
an amazing performance.

1174
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:44,458
Here it is, the moment you've

1175
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:46,249
all been waiting for.

1176
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,521
The team who showed the best

1177
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:50,790
in Black River teamwork is...

1178
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,083
Team Awesome Sauce!

1179
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,458
Sage, there you are. I've been

1180
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:18,165
looking all over for you.

1181
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,332
Mind if I sit with you?

1182
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,707
Yeah.

1183
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,333
Okay.

1184
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,437
So I should probably tell you

1185
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:33,665
about my cousin.

1186
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,250
She's older than me, like

1187
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:36,832
15 years or so.

1188
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,812
But, uh, you know, she's got a

1189
00:55:39,813 --> 00:55:42,790
family, she's got a career.

1190
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:44,979
She's actually a surgeon,

1191
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,165
so she's super smart, right?

1192
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:49,583
You want to know something else

1193
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:52,000
about my cousin?

1194
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,438
She's had a speech impediment

1195
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,249
her entire life.

1196
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,375
She said that she used to cry

1197
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:01,499
when she'd have to stand up...

1198
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,938
in front of all the other kids

1199
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:04,374
at school and talk...

1200
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:05,854
and I know she doesn't even like

1201
00:56:05,855 --> 00:56:07,332
to do it to this day.

1202
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,750
And that's okay, because that's

1203
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:12,165
just not her thing...

1204
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,666
just like my thing is

1205
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:15,165
I don't dance.

1206
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,500
Have you seen me dance?

1207
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,457
It's not even called dancing...

1208
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,312
it's called tripping and falling

1209
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:23,165
and stumbling.

1210
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,291
But that's okay.

1211
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,083
- My friend Kathy, she's my best
- friend...

1212
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:33,521
She says that each of us needs

1213
00:56:33,522 --> 00:56:36,707
a good friend to show us...

1214
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:40,790
the best part of who we are.

1215
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,999
Everyone has their weaknesses...

1216
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,438
but also we have a special

1217
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:49,874
talent inside...

1218
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,125
that could make the world a

1219
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:52,374
better place if we shared it.

1220
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,999
Do you understand?

1221
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,458
I got something for you.

1222
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,646
After our show, I ran to the

1223
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:03,541
cabins and I grabbed it.

1224
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,417
Kathy gave me this, because she

1225
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:10,082
saw something in me...

1226
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,874
that I didn't know was there.

1227
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:14,979
I thought it was very courageous

1228
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,082
of you tonight...

1229
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,771
to get on that stage in front

1230
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,457
of all those people.

1231
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:23,332
Camp Princess-worthy.

1232
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,208
- Would you do me the favor
- and hold onto this...

1233
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:27,957
'til the end of the summer?

1234
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:31,707
There is one condition, though.

1235
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,875
Don't worry, it's not pots and

1236
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,040
pans or anything like that.

1237
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,000
I want you to use that courage

1238
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:41,957
and try to find...

1239
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,021
that one talent, that one

1240
00:57:45,022 --> 00:57:48,082
special thing...

1241
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:49,792
that will make the world

1242
00:57:49,793 --> 00:57:51,499
a better place.

1243
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,166
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

1244
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,416
Okay. Okay, c'mere.

1245
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:01,271
Why don't we go join the others

1246
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:03,707
and celebrate our win...

1247
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,041
- with eating some ice cream,
- okay?

1248
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:06,249
Yeah!

1249
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,458
Let's go. C'mere.

1250
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,792
I'm not sure I much see the

1251
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,832
point of tellin"em right now.

1252
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,125
- What they don't know
- won't hurt 'em...

1253
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,832
I guess is what I'm thinkin'.

1254
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:21,937
Could be that's the way

1255
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:23,040
to handle it, sure.

1256
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,915
But?

1257
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,583
I ever tell you about my

1258
00:58:26,584 --> 00:58:28,249
cousin Dan?

1259
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,208
One summer, when we was about,

1260
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:32,165
oh, ten or so...

1261
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:34,250
my uncle told him to go pick up

1262
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:36,332
a bag of horse feed...

1263
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,083
down at the supply store down

1264
00:58:38,084 --> 00:58:39,832
the road a ways.

1265
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,229
Now Dan, he didn't weigh much

1266
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,624
more...

1267
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:44,500
- than that 50-pound bag
- of food did.

1268
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:45,729
And when he got there

1269
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,957
and he saw how heavy it was...

1270
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,708
he decided that he would drag it

1271
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:50,457
all the way home...

1272
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,979
was about three miles or so,

1273
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,499
I think it was.

1274
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,749
Well, did he make it?

1275
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,999
Yeah, eventually.

1276
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,042
He was always a stubborn kid.

1277
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:01,082
Took him half the day.

1278
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,604
And he was pretty rung out,

1279
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,124
sore for days afterward.

1280
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,500
Lost a big chunk of the food,

1281
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:06,874
too, on account of the hole...

1282
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:09,125
- he wore in the bag by draggin'
- it like that.

1283
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,750
Funny thing is, I remember

1284
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:14,374
riding my bike down to check...

1285
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:15,708
on him a couple of times and I

1286
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:17,040
asked him if he needed any help.

1287
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,666
He just kept saying, "No, I can

1288
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:20,291
do it. I can do it."

1289
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,916
- Just, you know, I always
- wondered why he wouldn't...

1290
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:25,562
Let anyone share the burden,

1291
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,207
so to speak.

1292
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,500
Save him a lot of extra trouble

1293
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:29,790
I would think, don't you?

1294
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:30,958
You know a way to help me,

1295
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:32,124
Jerry?

1296
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:35,082
Me? No... wish I did.

1297
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,812
But you know somebody who

1298
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:38,540
might be able to?

1299
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,790
I really don't.

1300
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,396
But the thing is, we won't

1301
00:59:43,397 --> 00:59:46,000
know unless we ask.

1302
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:55,666
( MUSIC PLAYING )

1303
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:13,957
What's up?

1304
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,625
So that vaulting thing you

1305
01:00:15,626 --> 01:00:17,290
were telling me about?

1306
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:18,499
Can I still do that?

1307
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,938
Yeah! But what changed

1308
01:00:19,939 --> 01:00:21,374
your mind?

1309
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,771
Well, when I was practicing

1310
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:24,165
for the talent show...

1311
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,875
- the whole time I was just
- thinking...

1312
01:00:25,878 --> 01:00:27,938
How amazing would it be to do

1313
01:00:27,939 --> 01:00:29,999
that on a horse.

1314
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,104
Absolutely... but there's just

1315
01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:36,207
one condition...

1316
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,208
and you're not gonna like it.

1317
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:46,707
No. Unh-unh. No way.

1318
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,540
Worst idea ever!

1319
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:52,957
Yes way, and best idea ever!

1320
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,625
With Sam's gymnastic ability,

1321
01:00:54,626 --> 01:00:56,290
she could be a great vaulter...

1322
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,854
and you know it... just needs

1323
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,415
to learn from the best...

1324
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,291
and that's you.

1325
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,792
Fine, but only if she listens

1326
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:09,124
to every single thing I say.

1327
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,563
Fine, but only if you don't

1328
01:01:10,564 --> 01:01:11,999
give me your pointers...

1329
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,082
when I'm trying to concentrate.

1330
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:16,207
Fine.

1331
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,375
Great! You guys wanna shake

1332
01:01:17,376 --> 01:01:18,541
hands?

1333
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:27,916
All right.

1334
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,415
Sam? This letter came for you.

1335
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:35,750
Thanks!

1336
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,000
- GRAM (V.O.) I had a feeling
- you'd thrive there...

1337
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,707
At camp, honey bear.

1338
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,167
It makes me so happy to know

1339
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:50,624
you're making friends...

1340
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,500
and I want to hear all

1341
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:54,374
about them.

1342
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,583
It sounds like you'll have

1343
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:56,790
a wonderful experience...

1344
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,021
to share with them

1345
01:01:58,022 --> 01:01:59,249
for the rest of your life.

1346
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,938
Keep making the most

1347
01:02:00,939 --> 01:02:02,624
of your time there.

1348
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,188
I can't wait to see you

1349
01:02:04,189 --> 01:02:05,749
in the final show...

1350
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,040
at the end of summer.

1351
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,625
- It'll be here
- before you know it.

1352
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,583
Love you, Gram.

1353
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:33,750
- Listen up, ladies.
- I have a brief announcement.

1354
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,332
This will only take a minute.

1355
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:39,999
Uh...

1356
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,646
this is gonna be a little

1357
01:02:41,647 --> 01:02:43,291
more difficult than I thought.

1358
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,208
You know that attendance here

1359
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:47,582
at Black River Ranch...

1360
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,104
for the last few years

1361
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:50,624
has been dropping off.

1362
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,771
The ranch has been losing money

1363
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:54,915
for several years...

1364
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:57,666
a lot of money.

1365
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,542
Things just can't keep going

1366
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,207
the way they're going.

1367
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,937
What are you talking about,

1368
01:03:03,938 --> 01:03:05,665
Mr. C?

1369
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,875
I'm saying that this

1370
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:08,082
is the last season...

1371
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,146
for Black River Ranch

1372
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:10,208
horse camp.

1373
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:12,957
No! Oh no, no.

1374
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,833
- At the end of the season,
- we're dismantling the camp...

1375
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,125
And putting the property up

1376
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,415
for sale.

1377
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:19,500
I, uh, I thought you deserved

1378
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:21,582
to know.

1379
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:24,271
Uh, I know this is bitter news

1380
01:03:24,272 --> 01:03:26,957
to swallow...

1381
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,937
but, uh, the summer's

1382
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,915
only half over...

1383
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,958
- and there are lots of wonderful
- girls out there...

1384
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:34,021
Who deserve the best time

1385
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,082
of their lives.

1386
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,229
So let's make sure they get

1387
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,375
that, all right?

1388
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,708
All right, let's get back at it.

1389
01:03:40,709 --> 01:03:42,833
All right, back at it.

1390
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,665
I am so sorry, Jessica.

1391
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:00,791
- I would have done anything to
- arrange for you...

To have your wedding here but I,

1393
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:03,541

get up on the horse.

1407
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,312
You two need to work

1408
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:21,457

- what a team is?

What have I ever done?

Yes, you.

Ladies, ladies, can someone

1420
01:05:57,522 --> 01:05:58,665
please tell me...

- into Mr. C's bank account.

I'm saving camp, Mr. C.

1430
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:20,457
That's final.

1431
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,292
But I do need to use your phone,

please.

Please?

Hey, is this some kind of

1435
01:06:34,063 --> 01:06:35,332
joke, Stacy?

1436
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,790
Of... of course not.

1437
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,333
- It's just that Black River

Well, it sure sounds like one.

After all of the money I have

1440
01:06:40,939 --> 01:06:42,124
dumped into that camp...

1441
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,458
over the years, they've got to

1442
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:44,790
be out of their minds...

1443
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:46,833
- if they think I'm going to throw
- away good money...

1444
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,540
On some charity case.

1445
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,771
It's not a charity case.

1446
01:06:50,772 --> 01:06:52,999
They just need a little help.

1447
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,688
It's not my fault if they don't

1448
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:56,374
know how to run a business.

1449
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:57,708
Bottom line, I built this

1450
01:06:57,709 --> 01:06:59,040

1451
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:01,207

I said they know how to run

1456
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,415
a business. It's just...

1457
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,915
Well, obviously they don't.

1458
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:11,125
- And if you can't tell the
- difference...

1459
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:13,125
- I'm starting to wonder why
- I'm spending all this money...

to get to.

1465
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,957
So what did he say?

1466
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,833
I said he would, didn't I?

1467
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,707
And the arbor will go there.

1468
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,833
- And the guests, they'll sit
- over there.

1469
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:03,625

1470
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:05,415

01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,124

Get a room?

01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,937
it's almost like I'll be right

2042
01:41:45,938 --> 01:41:47,916
there looking down on you.

2043
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,833
Anyway, I've sent along

2044
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:53,707
a little present for you...

2045
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:55,958
in this letter, something

2046
01:41:55,959 --> 01:41:58,207
for you to remember me by...

2047
01:41:58,208 --> 01:41:59,958
if I'm not there.

2048
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:08,917
I don't think I've ever

2049
01:42:08,918 --> 01:42:09,957
really explained...

2050
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,292
why this medal was

2051
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:12,624
so important to me.

2052
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:14,604
I won quite a few individual

2053
01:42:14,605 --> 01:42:16,582
medals over the years...

2054
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:18,625
but this was the only team

2055
01:42:18,626 --> 01:42:20,665
medal I ever won.

2056
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:22,479
It is a constant reminder

2057
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,290
of my team...

2058
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:28,291
of the friendships we forged.

2059
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:31,729
We were there for each other

2060
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,333
through thick and thin.

2061
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:36,708
From your letters, it sounds

2062
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:38,040
like you have found...

2063
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:40,208
the same friendships at camp.

2064
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:43,500
Those friendships are the most

2065
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:44,790
important prize...

2066
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:46,187
you could ever earn

2067
01:42:46,188 --> 01:42:47,582
in this life.

2068
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,458
Cherish them.

2069
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,375
Okay, okay, I've rambled on

2070
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:55,749
long enough.

2071
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,333
Enjoy the rest of your time

2072
01:42:57,334 --> 01:42:58,915
there, sugar bear.

2073
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:02,583
See you soon. Love, Gram.

2074
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:10,083
I love you too, Grams.

2075
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:22,146
Yeah, let's... let's see what

2076
01:43:22,147 --> 01:43:23,665
we got goin' on here.

2077
01:43:23,666 --> 01:43:25,415

- Why don't you guys go get

2079
01:43:26,878 --> 01:43:28,541
- Okay.
- Thanks.

2083
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,167
I just wanted to thank you for

2084
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,082
saving the package from Gram.

2085
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:39,917
It's really special, and I could

2086
01:43:39,918 --> 01:43:41,749
never repay you.

2087
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,125
Don't thank me. Make sure

2088
01:43:43,126 --> 01:43:44,499
you thank Jerry.

2089
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,500
He's the one who found it.

2090
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:49,874
I want to try.

2091
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:51,375
Try what?

2092
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:54,354
Black River has meant so

2093
01:43:54,355 --> 01:43:55,790
much to me.

2094
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:57,666
And I wanna try and return

2095
01:43:57,667 --> 01:43:59,541

01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:10,416

- Really!

2097
01:44:10,419 --> 01:44:12,458

- Let's go!

2098
01:44:12,461 --> 01:44:14,415

- Heck, I've even got reservations
- for next season...
