1664
01:55:55,361 --> 01:55:57,591
About me, I mean?

1665
01:55:59,766 --> 01:56:01,427
Have you?

1666
01:56:04,504 --> 01:56:06,131
Yeah.

1667
01:56:31,831 --> 01:56:34,095
- This isn't gonna work, is it?
- No way, no how!

1668
01:56:34,267 --> 01:56:35,427
- Damn!
- Oh!

[LAUGHING]

1670
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:39,297
Oh, wow.

1671
01:56:39,706 --> 01:56:42,197
I mean, that was like kissing my sister.

1672
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:45,037
- I'm so relieved!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1673
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:48,772
I got this letter and I thought he must have
been feeling self-sacrificing...

1674
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:51,940
...but he's really full of crap.
If he meant it, he'd give me a sign.

1675
01:56:52,118 --> 01:56:55,349
- I hate signs.
- Then I got your message on the machine.

1677
01:57:01,894 --> 01:57:04,624
Weird, bitter friends?

1678
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:08,162
Forever.

1680
01:57:20,279 --> 01:57:22,042
What's wrong, friend?

1681
01:57:22,215 --> 01:57:24,183
It's Gerry.

1682
01:57:26,185 --> 01:57:28,016
It's been a year...

1683
01:57:30,356 --> 01:57:33,223
...and I don't feel him
around me anymore.

1684
01:57:35,228 --> 01:57:37,526
I don't think he's here anymore.

1685
01:57:40,032 --> 01:57:42,227
I think Gerry's gone.

1686
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:45,397
[WHISPERS]
He's really gone.

1687

<i>HOLLY:
Dear Gerry, you said you wanted me...</i>

1688
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:08,693
<i>... to fall in love again...</i>

1689
01:58:08,861 --> 01:58:13,264
<i>... and maybe one day I will,
but there are all kinds of love out there.</i>

1690
01:58:14,467 --> 01:58:16,264
<i>This is my one and only life...</i>

1691
01:58:16,669 --> 01:58:20,127
<i>... and it's a great and terrible
and short and endless thing...</i>

1692
01:58:20,306 --> 01:58:23,104
<i>... and none of us come out of it alive.</i>

1693
01:58:32,952 --> 01:58:37,582
<i>I don't have a plan except
that it's time my mom laughed again.</i>

1694
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:39,621
<i>She's never seen the world.</i>

1695
01:58:39,792 --> 01:58:45,788
<i>She's never seen Ireland, so I'm
taking her back to where we started.</i>

1696
01:58:52,038 --> 01:58:54,404
<i>Maybe now she'll understand.</i>

1697
01:59:02,949 --> 01:59:04,143
Mom?

1698
01:59:19,732 --> 01:59:20,926
William?

1699
01:59:22,835 --> 01:59:24,029
Hello, you.

1700
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,705
You back for another visit?

1701
01:59:30,042 --> 01:59:31,339
How long?

1702
01:59:32,411 --> 01:59:33,969
I don't know.

1703
01:59:36,282 --> 01:59:38,648
Oh, um... This is my mom, Patricia.

1704
01:59:39,085 --> 01:59:40,950
Hello. This is me father, Patsy.

1705
01:59:45,191 --> 01:59:47,056
You've dropped your sweets, luv.

1706
01:59:47,226 --> 01:59:49,217
Mustn't do that around these parts.

1707
01:59:49,395 --> 01:59:52,990
Pretty woman like you,
a fella could take it the wrong way.

1710
02:00:10,983 --> 02:00:12,541
So I'll see you around, then?

1711
02:00:13,619 --> 02:00:15,052
Yeah.

1712
02:00:21,954 --> 02:00:25,856
<i>HOLLY: I don't know how you did it,
but you brought me back from the dead.</i>

02:00:26,025 --> 02:00:28,050
<i>I'll write to you again soon.</i>

1714
02:00:28,227 --> 02:00:30,092
