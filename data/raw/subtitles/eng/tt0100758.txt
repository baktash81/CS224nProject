1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,434
Much more than just a series
of small, isolated incidents...

2
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:26,064
it's apparent an organized
criminal element is at work.

3
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:28,506
And at the moment,
business is good.

4
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,671
So good, in fact, there appear
to be no eyewitnesses...

5
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:34,247
to any of these crimes.

6
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,749
With complaints ranging
from purse-snatching...

7
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,250
to breaking and entering...

8
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,252
police switchboards have been
swamped...

9
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,256
with the angry voices
of more and more citizens...

10
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:46,554
who have fallen prey
to the recent surge of crime...

11
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,560
that continues
to plague the city.

12
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:08,676
Instead of getting better,
things have gotten worse.

13
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,148
Even more alarming
is the baffling...

14
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,449
and often bizarre
nature of these crimes.

15
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,157
Merchandise of every size
and description...

16
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:20,659
from skateboards
to stereo systems...

17
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,060
has been disappearing
from store shelves...

18
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:26,258
and storage areas
at an alarming rate.

19
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:33,707
Even the victims themselves
rarely glimpse the thieves.

20
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:37,573
Many don't know they've been
victimized until it's too late.

21
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:42,912
In fact, police have yet
to come up with an eyewitness.

22
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:44,916
Only a few vague reports...

23
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:49,421
of young boys or teenagers
at the scenes have been filed.

24
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:53,426
But whoever is behind these
crimes, one thing is certain.

25
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:59,125
These are much more than just
a series of random incidents.

26
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,100
Come on. Hurry up.

27
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,050
Good.

28
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:25,151
Crimes without criminals?

29
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,989
An invisible gang at work?

30
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,653
Who are we going to call?

31
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:32,062
Unfortunately, the police
are the only ones available...

32
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:36,694
to combat what some are dubbing
"the silent crime wave."

33
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:39,466
But perhaps the most
disturbing silence...

34
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,974
is that coming from City Hall.

35
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:45,602
April O'Neil,
Channel Three Eyewitness News.

36
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,544
You got to stop working so hard.

37
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,550
What, give up all this glamour?

38
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,518
Good night.

39
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,716
Bad timing.

40
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:33,920
You're telling me.

41
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:36,428
Get her purse.

42
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,727
Get away from me!
What do you think... Help!

43
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:42,200
- Get her jewelry.
- I got her watch!

44
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:03,191
What the hell's going on?
Thought I'd seen it all.

45
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:08,988
All right. Come on, tough guys.

46
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:13,724
You all right, ma'am?

47
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,393
I'm fine.

48
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,563
Rest right here
while we deal with these guys.

49
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:27,405
Ted, give John a hand.

50
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,915
Oh, man.

51
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,222
Let's get them in the car.

52
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:36,449
Damn.

53
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,310
Oh, spectacular.

54
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,819
We were awesome, bros.

55
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:08,251
Awesome!

56
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,618
Yes, dudes and dude-ettes...

57
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,886
major league butt-kicking
is back in town.

58
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,996
Awesome!

59
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:22,334
Righteous!

60
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:25,531
- Bossa nova!
- What?

61
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,300
Bossa nova?

62
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,410
Chevy Nova?

63
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,973
Excellent!

64
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,976
All right!

65
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,983
Come on, let's move it.

66
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,485
I'm starving.

67
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:41,645
We're talking...

68
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:42,813
major pizza attack here, dudes.

69
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:46,325
Pizza! I need it. Oh, baby.

70
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:48,429
Oh, man!

71
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,031
What's eating him, bros?

72
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:54,533
Give me three.

73
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,193
You got it.

74
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,642
We were great.

75
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,278
Damn!

76
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,853
We have had our first battle...

77
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,219
Master plinter.

78
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:21,124
They were many, but we kicked...

79
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,288
We fought well.

80
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:26,298
Were you seen?

81
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:30,598
In this you must never lapse.

82
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,604
Even those who would be...

83
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:36,336
our allies would not understand.

84
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:40,004
Our domain is the shadow.

85
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,241
Stray from it reluctantly.

86
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,750
For when you do, you must...

87
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,753
strike hard and fade away...

88
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,657
Without a trace.

89
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,292
I lost a sai.

90
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,930
Then it is gone.

91
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,030
But I can get it back.

92
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,032
Raphael... let it go.

93
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:10,369
Your ninja skills
are reaching their peak.

94
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:17,384
Only one truly important lesson
remains, but must wait.

95
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:22,286
I know it is hard
for you here underground.

96
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,325
I want a large thick crust
with double cheese...

97
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:26,620
ham, pepperoni...

98
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:30,629
Your teenage minds
are broad, eager.

99
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:35,361
But you must never stop
practicing the art of ninja...

100
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:39,098
the art of invisibility.

101
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:41,265
Oh, but no anchovies.

102
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,206
And I mean no anchovies.

103
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,247
You put anchovies on this thing,
and you're in big trouble.

104
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,440
Michaelangelo!

105
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:51,142
That'll do.
And the clock's ticking, dude.

106
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,788
You are still young...

107
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,124
but one day, I will be gone.

108
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:06,165
Use my teachings wisely.

109
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:12,899
I suggest we all meditate now
on the events of this evening.

110
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,750
Ninjitsu!

111
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:36,022
Well, this is like meditating.

112
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,764
Hey, Raph, where you going?

113
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,835
Out to a movie.

114
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,972
That OK with you?

115
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,949
Sock it to me, baby.

116
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,033
How you doing?

117
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:16,262
Fine.

118
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,201
Nice night.

119
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,843
Pizza dude's got 30 seconds.

120
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:31,710
Mikey, did you ever think about
what plinter said tonight?

121
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:37,883
I mean, about what it would
be like not having him?

122
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:43,160
Time's up. Three bucks off.

123
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:01,208
Now, 122... 122 1/8?

124
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,409
One-twenty-two and an eigth?

125
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:08,750
Terrific.
Where the heck is 122 1/8?

126
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:11,950
You're standing on it, dude.

127
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,186
Just slip it down here.

128
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:22,970
Give me that!

129
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:29,075
This is a 10. The tab's 13.

130
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,575
You're two minutes late, dude.

131
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,613
Come on!
I couldn't find the place!

132
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:35,943
Wise man say,
"Forgiveness is divine...

133
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,951
"but never pay full price
for late pizza."

134
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,215
I got to get a new route.

135
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,983
And I thought
I delivered everywhere.

136
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,560
Yes, friends,
the new Turbo Ginsu!

137
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,424
It dices, it slices...

138
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,658
and yet makes french fries
in three different...

139
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,361
Kids.

140
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,244
Where do they come up
with this stuff?

141
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,799
Somebody stop them!

142
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,614
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

143
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:51,225
That was a crime,
you purse-grabbing pukes...

144
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,224
and this is the penalty.

145
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,195
Two minutes for slashing,
two minutes for hooking...

146
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,699
and let's not forget
my personal favorite...

147
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:03,303
two minutes for high-sticking.

148
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,174
How about a five-minute game
misconduct for roughing, pal?

149
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,833
Hey, Bogey...

150
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,445
who died and made you referee?

151
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,410
You did your job. Get out
of here and let me do mine.

152
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,174
These JV lowlifes need
to be taught a lesson.

153
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,547
Not like that they don't.
Not from you.

154
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:26,050
It looks like you're
the one who needs a lesson, pal.

155
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:30,164
Class is Pain 101.
Your instructor is Casey Jones.

156
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,857
I don't want to fight you.

157
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,832
Tough rocks, pal.

158
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,631
A Jose Canseco bat?

159
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,436
Tell me... you didn't
pay money for this.

160
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,045
That's it.

161
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,545
Was a two-for-one sale, pal.

162
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,715
Hey, what are you,
some sort of punker?

163
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:55,646
I hate punkers.

164
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:58,258
Especially bald ones
with green makeup...

165
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,918
who wear masks over ugly faces.

166
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,154
That's it.

167
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,031
New batter! Strike one!

168
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,930
Whiffer.

169
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,763
Home run.

170
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,033
Raphael wins!

171
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:18,873
One-nothing!

172
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,677
Well?

173
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,410
New game, roundhead.

174
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,015
Cricket.

175
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,820
Cricket?
Nobody understands cricket.

176
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,589
You got to know what a crumpet
is to understand cricket.

177
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,857
I'll teach you.

178
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:43,664
Six runs.

179
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:51,711
So long, freak.
I got work to do.

180
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,245
Freak?!

181
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,358
What the heck was that?

182
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:08,360
Looked like a big turtle
in a trench coat.

183
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,623
You going to La Guardia?

184
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,267
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!

185
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,029
Damn!

186
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,313
Come sit by me.

187
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,478
Couldn't this wait till morning?

188
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,817
You will listen now.

189
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:51,167
My master Yoshi's
first rule was...

190
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:55,171
Possess the right thinking.

191
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:58,744
Only then can one receive...

192
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:03,476
the gifts of strength,
knowledge, and peace.

193
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:11,521
I have tried to channel
your anger, Raphael...

194
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,820
but more remains.

195
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:17,761
Anger clouds the mind.

196
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:22,802
Turned inward,
it is an unconquerable enemy.

197
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:27,430
You are unique
among your brothers...

198
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:32,444
for you choose
to face this enemy alone.

199
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:38,314
But as you face it,
do not forget them.

200
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:42,150
And do not forget me.

201
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:49,094
I am here, my son.

202
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:50,298
April, you could've called me
last night, you know?

203
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:53,495
April, you could've called me
last night, you know?

204
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,465
Call it a quirk,
but I like to know...

205
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,867
when one of my best reporters
has been mugged.

206
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,301
I wasn't mugged, Charles.

207
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,305
Besides,
I knew you'd just worry...

208
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:04,639
and rush over here
like you did this morning.

209
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,974
From now on,
security is gonna escort you...

210
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,310
to that stone-age van of yours
every night.

211
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:12,078
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not kidding, April.

212
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,449
Hey, Danny, how's school going?

213
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,648
- Fine.
- Wonderful.

214
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:20,659
So wonderful I have to drive
him there every morning now...

215
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,126
just to make sure he goes.

216
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,560
That's what he does
when he wants to ignore me...

217
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,204
sticks his head in those things.

218
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:33,864
I wonder where the hell
he got those things, anyway.

219
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,839
Charles, give the kid a break.

220
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:41,146
Just what is going on
out there, April?

221
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,046
I've never seen anything
like this before.

222
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,016
It's like
the city's falling apart.

223
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:49,385
It's getting so you can't step
outside in the daytime anymore.

224
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:51,321
I'll tell you one thing.

225
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:54,326
After everything I've been
hearing out of Little Tokyo...

226
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,828
Sterns is gonna have some
answering to do this afternoon.

227
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:59,558
Just take it easy.

228
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:02,794
He's already got the mayor
breathing down my neck.

229
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:05,872
We are presently executing
a plan of redeployment...

230
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,872
that will minimize
response time...

231
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:11,206
while maximizing coordination
between patrol units...

232
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:14,371
in a decentralized
networking scheme.

233
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:20,286
I'm not sure I understood
all that, Chief Sterns.

234
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:24,357
Would you mind repeating it...
in English, perhaps?

235
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:29,828
What that means, Miss O'Neil,
is everything is well in hand.

236
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:33,161
Hey, guys, look. That's her.

237
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,667
I didn't say that either,
Miss O'Neil.

238
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:38,328
If you would stick
to asking questions...

239
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,802
I'm in love.

240
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,842
What do you know
about an organization...

241
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,343
known as The Foot Clan?

242
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:49,415
There is no evidence to link
such a name to these incidents.

243
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:53,418
Are you denying an organization
known as The Foot exists?

244
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,488
I'm not denying anything.

245
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,387
You're putting words
into my mouth.

246
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,291
Find her.

247
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,557
Silence her.

248
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,702
- She's great.
- An understatement as usual.

249
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,531
You're telling me.
The girl is a fox.

250
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,263
Take a look at the local
weather for this vicinity...

251
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,566
as it stands at this hour.

252
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:16,302
O'Neil, get in here.

253
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,445
Time me.

254
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,885
Just what is it you
hoped to accomplish out there...

255
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,388
besides busting my chops?

256
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,120
I think you know as much
as I do about this Foot Clan...

257
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,527
and I don't think you're
doing anything about it.

258
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,496
You expect me to waste
precious manpower...

259
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,863
because a few immigrants
are reminded of something...

260
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,063
that supposedly happened
years ago in Japan?

261
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,571
Have you got something else?

262
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:50,837
Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?

263
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,281
One minute, seven seconds...
a new record.

264
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:20,001
Oh... great. Just great.

265
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:33,385
We've been waiting for you,
Miss O'Neil.

266
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:37,889
Am I behind
on my Sony payments again?

267
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,393
Your mouth may yet bring you
much trouble, Miss O'Neil.

268
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:45,260
I deliver a message.

269
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:48,896
Shut it.

270
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:56,770
All right. That's it!

271
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:57,839
Are you crazy?

272
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,830
Are you crazy?

273
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,436
Yeah, Leo, I'm crazy!

274
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,203
A loony!

275
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,472
Why?

276
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:08,980
Why? Oh, I don't know.

277
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,947
'Cause I wanted to redecorate.

278
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,179
A couple of throw pillows,
a TV news reporter.

279
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,982
What do you think?

280
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:17,988
Raphael, what are you doing?

281
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,127
She got jumped in the subway.

282
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:23,355
- I had to bring her here.
- It's the news lady.

283
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,590
Can we keep her?

284
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:28,801
Bring water,
cold washcloth, pillow.

285
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,369
Far out!

286
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,560
Oh, my God!

287
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,995
I'm dead! I'm dead, aren't I?

288
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,998
- It's OK.
- No, I'm dreaming.

289
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,329
I must be dreaming.

290
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:06,099
Those guys in the black pajamas,
they jumped me.

291
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:09,004
And that rat... I saw you
in the parking lot.

292
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:12,374
That explains you.
And you guys...

293
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,178
I have no idea
where you came from.

294
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:22,119
If you will please just sit down
and calm yourself...

295
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,054
I will tell you
where we came from.

296
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:26,625
It talks!

297
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:28,989
It is really quite simple,
Miss O'Neil.

298
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:33,862
And he knows my name. Perfect.

299
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:36,162
Fifteen years ago...

300
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:39,329
Why don't I ever dream of
Harrison Ford?

301
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:46,837
For 15 years now,
we have lived here.

302
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:53,511
Before that time, I was a pet
of my master Yoshi...

303
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:57,419
mimicking his movements
from my cage...

304
00:22:57,592 --> 00:23:00,891
and learning
the secret art of ninja.

305
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:06,422
When we were forced to come
to New York...

306
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:10,230
I found myself for the first
time without a home...

307
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:16,935
wandering the sewers, scavenging
for whatever I could find.

308
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,306
And then, one day...

309
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,278
I came upon
a shattered glass jar...

310
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,748
and four baby turtles.

311
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,443
That was us.

312
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,316
Shut up.

313
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:34,761
The little ones were crawling
into a strange glowing ooze...

314
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,092
from a broken canister nearby.

315
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,465
I gathered them up
in an old coffee can...

316
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,470
and when
I awoke the next morning...

317
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,805
I received a shock,
for they had doubled in size.

318
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:54,608
l, too, was growing,
particularly in intellect...

319
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:58,218
and I was amazed at how
intelligent they seemed.

320
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:03,119
But nothing could have prepared
me for what happened next.

321
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,122
One of them spoke.

322
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,853
Pizza! Pizza!

323
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,931
More words followed,
and I began their training...

324
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,934
teaching them all that
I had learned from my master.

325
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,072
Radical! Radical! Radical!

326
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:21,731
And soon
I gave them all names...

327
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:23,934
Leonardo...

328
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,273
- Michaelangelo...
- That's me.

329
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,881
Donatello...

330
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,745
and Raphael.

331
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:37,987
I'm not dreaming, am I?

332
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,627
I'm afraid not.

333
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,933
Are you guys sure you
know where you're going?

334
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:51,435
11th and Bleecker?

335
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,437
Nope. This is only 9th street.

336
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,599
- Get it?
- Yuck.

337
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,591
I'd like
to invite you all in...

338
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,130
but I don't have anything to
offer you except frozen pizza.

339
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,597
Let's go for it!

340
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:23,259
You said the magic word.

341
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,601
- You guys eat pizza?
- Doesn't everybody?

342
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:30,369
Well, all right...

343
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,877
Did she say pizza?

344
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:35,345
So, you live
in an antique store?

345
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:37,848
- Yep. Pizza!
- Well, above, actually.

346
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:41,682
What do you guys
like on your pizza?

347
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:46,259
Just the regular stuff...
flies, stink bugs.

348
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:48,918
It was a joke.

349
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,138
Maybe I'll fight Apollo,
and maybe I won't, you know?

350
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,038
What do you think? Adrian!

351
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,338
Hey, I got another one!

352
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:09,040
- This is totally cool!
- Oh, no, not Cagney.

353
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:14,120
You dirty rat.
You killed my brother.

354
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:15,778
You dirty rat.

355
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,885
That must be
Splinter's favorite.

356
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,667
It was a joke.

357
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:41,211
And speaking of which,
we better get going.

358
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:43,646
He worries.

359
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:46,548
I don't know what to say.

360
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,951
Will I ever see you guys again?

361
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,147
Indubitably.

362
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:53,157
That depends on how fast
you stock your pizza.

363
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:55,158
See you around.

364
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,354
- Bye.
- Later.

365
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:03,404
[Skipped item nr. 365]

366
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:06,168
No doubt about it.
She loved us!

367
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,807
It was the impressions.

368
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,636
- You wish.
- Hold it.

369
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,820
What's wrong?

370
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,279
Charles Pennington?

371
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,416
Yeah. Who's this?

372
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,017
You got a son
named Danny, Charles?

373
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,801
Who is it?

374
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:45,302
It's me, Charles.

375
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,271
It's my boss.

376
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:50,603
Can you guys...

377
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:51,836
hide?

378
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,679
Charles, what's up?

379
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,185
April... listen.

380
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:07,461
You have been working
awful hard on this story lately.

381
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:09,858
Why don't you take it easy
for a while?

382
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,791
Just let somebody else
handle it.

383
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:18,870
Just for a little while,
you know?

384
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,406
What are you talking about?
It's my story. No way.

385
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:22,940
Look at you. You're exhausted.

386
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,078
I just had a rough night.

387
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,942
Let somebody else
help you cover City Hall.

388
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:31,516
Charles, that's ridiculous.
What's with you today?

389
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,017
Nothing's with me today.

390
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:36,520
I just thought you might like
a little help.

391
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,491
I don't.
Hand me a towel, will you?

392
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:42,356
Where do you keep the towels?

393
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:45,362
What's wrong?

394
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,367
I just don't want you to see
my unsightly bathtub ring.

395
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,368
Out, out, out, out.

396
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,370
I have to get ready for work.

397
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,032
Are you sure you won't
reconsider about some help?

398
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,542
Danny, will you tell
your father to relax?

399
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,010
I wish.

400
00:30:01,682 --> 00:30:04,674
Just don't push
any buttons today.

401
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:09,755
That was close.

402
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:14,156
Time to switch to decaf, April.

403
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:15,625
I don't get it, Danny.

404
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:18,788
I make more than enough money
to provide for both of us...

405
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:21,127
and you're stealing. Why?

406
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,429
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

407
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:26,505
What the heck were you doing
with a car stereo anyway?

408
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,073
Or don't you know that either?

409
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,402
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

410
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,603
Not as sorry as you're
going to be after school.

411
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,714
Danny, come back here!

412
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:21,759
Check it out, man.
Anything you guys want, we got.

413
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:24,830
Anything you want to do... do it.

414
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,830
Know what I'm saying? Anything.

415
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,764
You got any cigarettes?

416
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,768
Regular or menthol?

417
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,417
Read 'em and weep, boys.
Full house!

418
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:55,091
Go. Play.

419
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,505
You.

420
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,255
Good.

421
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:42,268
Never lower your eyes
to an enemy.

422
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,274
Yes, Master Tatsu.

423
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,881
Master Shredder.

424
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:48,362
Money cannot buy the honor
which you have earned tonight.

425
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,608
You make us all proud.

426
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,110
Only effort,
discipline, loyalty...

427
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:07,914
earn the right to wear
the Dragon dogi.

428
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:12,991
You are here because
the outside world rejects you.

429
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,458
This is your family.

430
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:19,258
I am your father.

431
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:26,134
I want you all to become
full members of The Foot.

432
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:29,105
There is a new enemy...

433
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:33,940
freaks of nature
who interfere with our business.

434
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:37,515
You are my eyes and ears.
Find them.

435
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:42,520
Together we will punish these...

436
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,625
creatures!

437
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:50,162
These... turtles!

438
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,128
Master.

439
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,576
This is beginning
to sound less and less...

440
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,510
like your common,
garden-variety subway mugging.

441
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:11,913
She's a good reporter.

442
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,111
She's a babe!

443
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:15,846
...known as The Foot.

444
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:17,991
I'm sorry... The Foot?

445
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:21,616
I know it sounds like a funky
club for podiatrists...

446
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,990
but I've been speaking with
a lot of Japanese-Americans...

447
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:27,133
in the past few days who say
that our recent crime wave...

448
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,134
is reminiscent of a secret band
of ninja thieves...

449
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,135
who once operated in Japan.

450
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:34,706
Are the police
looking into this?

451
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,775
I've included everything
in my statement...

452
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,742
but I doubt very much
that Chief Sterns...

453
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:42,245
is taking this possible
connection seriously.

454
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:45,408
Well, perhaps
if any of our viewers...

455
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:46,746
Oh, God.

456
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,013
Mr. Pennington,
Chief Sterns' office.

457
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,624
Pennington, I thought
we had a deal!

458
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,627
You still haven't told us how
you got away from your attacker.

459
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,766
It's really quite incredible.

460
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:03,096
Some citizens of New York
actually came to my rescue.

461
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,865
Who says everyone in the
Big Apple looks the other way?

462
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,168
Seriously, June, I would like
to take this opportunity...

463
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:13,609
to thank one of those
individuals in particular.

464
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,579
And if he's watching,
thanks, Raphael.

465
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:19,876
Studly!

466
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:23,250
Hey, look.
I think he's blushing.

467
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:25,016
I am not.

468
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:27,183
I think he's
actually turning red.

469
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,226
Maybe not.

470
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:35,493
So what do we do now?

471
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:37,933
What do you mean,
what do we do now?

472
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:39,595
Splinter's out there somewhere!

473
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:41,172
I know Splinter's out there.

474
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:42,740
- Fight?
- Fight.

475
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,309
- Kitchen?
- Kitchen.

476
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,843
What are we gonna do about it?

477
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,242
What can we do about it?

478
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,747
April's our only link
to these guys.

479
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,284
We have to wait until she
comes up with something.

480
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:59,051
So that's the plan
from our great leader?

481
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:00,989
Just sit here on our butts.

482
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:03,994
I never said
I was a great leader.

483
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:05,961
You sure
act like it sometimes.

484
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:09,500
Well, you act like a jerk
sometimes.

485
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,230
And this attitude of yours
isn't helping anything.

486
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:15,432
Maybe I'll just take
my attitude and leave!

487
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,270
- Why don't you?
- I will!

488
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:19,275
- Good!
- Great!

489
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:21,311
Go ahead.
We don't need you!

490
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:27,244
- Pork rind?
- Pork rind.

491
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,286
Damn!

492
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,632
Move it, will you?

493
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,427
You're letting him
blow right by you!

494
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:17,433
Can you believe this guy?

495
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:19,435
Don't just...

496
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:23,337
Ninja-kick the damn rabbit!
Do something!

497
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,377
April, you were great.

498
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:27,536
Thanks, Mikey.

499
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:30,808
She called me Mikey.

500
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:38,415
- Hear anything yet?
- Not yet.

501
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:41,720
They're going to repeat the
interview at 5:00 and at 6:00...

502
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:44,625
and we're going
to have to wait and see...

503
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:47,289
if it helps generate
any new information.

504
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,628
I told them
to call me here immediately...

505
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,566
if anyone calls the station.

506
00:39:51,738 --> 00:39:53,899
Thanks, April.

507
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:57,009
We really appreciate,
you know, everything.

508
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,873
Forget it.

509
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:03,578
Where's Raphael?

510
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:13,358
I was going to give you guys
a tour of the store.

511
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,119
Shall we go get him?

512
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,997
He just needs
to blow off some steam.

513
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:24,866
You guys must be studying the
abridged book of ninja fighting.

514
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:41,013
I mean, come on.

515
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,180
How do you guys
expect to beat me?

516
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,825
Good answer.

517
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:53,590
I only keep it open part-time,
mostly for my dad.

518
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:56,759
He loved junk. I don't know.

519
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:58,837
I guess it's kind of dumb
to lose money on a business...

520
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:01,338
just because
you miss your father.

521
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:02,975
No, it isn't.

522
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:06,605
Ready?

523
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:16,681
This place has everything.

524
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,586
Just about.

525
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:32,832
Hasn't Raph
been gone a long time?

526
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:35,736
He does it all the time.
He likes it.

527
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,075
Are you sure?

528
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,238
Don't worry. He'll probably
be back any minute.

529
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:49,411
- Is he...
- No, he's alive... barely.

530
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:04,526
And I thought
insurance salesmen were pushy.

531
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:12,041
A fellow chucker, eh?

532
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,713
Keep practicing.

533
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:00,158
Take that!

534
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,398
One of these guys knows where
they're holding Splinter...

535
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:12,003
so don't knock them all out.

536
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,164
I don't think
that will be a problem, Leo.

537
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:27,178
Gotcha.

538
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:33,824
Hey, Donnie,
Wheel of Fortune, dude.

539
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,224
Bisentos now!

540
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:45,031
I guess
they're not game show fans.

541
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,571
And I thought
everybody loved Vanna.

542
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,137
California roll!

543
00:43:54,314 --> 00:43:56,305
What a spaz.

544
00:43:56,483 --> 00:43:57,472
Missed again.

545
00:43:57,651 --> 00:43:58,811
Good thing these guys
aren't lumberjacks.

546
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:00,009
No joke.

547
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:03,987
The only thing safe
in the woods would be the trees.

548
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:08,718
Guys, I'm not so sure if this
is, structurally speaking...

549
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:12,854
such a good time
for your buddies to drop in.

550
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:25,236
Whoa, wipeout.

551
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:20,194
Man, we could really use
Raph right about now.

552
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:29,340
Now what?

553
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:36,045
You guys mind telling me...

554
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:39,208
what you're doing to
my little green pal over there?

555
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,884
Who is the babe?

556
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:46,355
Who the heck is that?

557
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:49,723
Wayne Gretzky on steroids?

558
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:52,091
Attack!

559
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:11,216
We got to get out of here.

560
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:20,453
Help me. There used to be
a trapdoor here to the basement.

561
00:46:20,627 --> 00:46:23,619
Come on, you all! Three more!

562
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,423
We're getting out of here.

563
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,806
Get away, man.
I'll take care of these guys.

564
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:36,940
You coming?

565
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,135
I'll cover you.

566
00:46:39,312 --> 00:46:40,745
Good idea.

567
00:46:44,717 --> 00:46:47,709
Hi, this is April.
Leave a message after the beep.

568
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:50,751
April, it's Charles.

569
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:53,256
I'm sorry. I don't know
how else to say this.

570
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:54,757
You're fired, April.

571
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:58,056
I'm sorry.
I know this comes as a blow.

572
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,759
You can say that again, Chuck.

573
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:02,458
Come on!

574
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:04,626
Bye, guys. Got to run.

575
00:47:08,374 --> 00:47:10,035
Ninja, vanish.

576
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:55,947
What are these... freaks?

577
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:59,614
How do they know how
to fight like this?

578
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:04,920
You will answer.

579
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:09,735
Then hang there until you die.

580
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:46,268
Master Tatsu, stop, please.

581
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:48,168
Please, stop it.

582
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:56,137
Shinsho.

583
00:49:00,553 --> 00:49:03,283
You'll be all right.

584
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:28,040
How can a face so young
wear so many burdens?

585
00:49:28,214 --> 00:49:30,375
So, you can talk.

586
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,919
Yes, and I can also listen.

587
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:40,055
Some say that the path
from inner turmoil...

588
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:44,162
begins with a friendly ear.

589
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,063
My ear is open
if you care to use it.

590
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,169
I don't think so.

591
00:49:51,337 --> 00:49:53,362
What is your name?

592
00:49:56,042 --> 00:50:00,172
And have you no one to go to,
Danny? No parent?

593
00:50:00,346 --> 00:50:02,780
My dad couldn't
care less about me.

594
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:06,316
I doubt that is true.

595
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:08,884
Why?

596
00:50:10,556 --> 00:50:15,357
All fathers care for their sons.

597
00:50:25,304 --> 00:50:28,068
- How's Raphael?
- Not so good.

598
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:30,869
Didn't they use this place
in The Grapes of Wrath?

599
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:33,011
Very funny.

600
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:37,206
I told you, I haven't been
up here in years.

601
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:44,979
Can you fix it?

602
00:50:51,397 --> 00:50:52,728
Does that answer your question?

603
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:56,391
The block's got a crack
the size of the San Andreas.

604
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:58,434
Wonderful.

605
00:50:58,604 --> 00:51:01,437
I guess
I've got some walking to do.

606
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:03,165
What for?

607
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:06,175
Our nearest neighbor
is about four miles away.

608
00:51:06,345 --> 00:51:09,178
I need to get to a phone,
and I need to call my boss.

609
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:10,474
You mean Charles?

610
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,140
How did you know that?

611
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,287
He left a message on your
machine just before we got out.

612
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:21,591
You just saved yourself
an eight-mile round-tripper.

613
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:23,752
You were fired.

614
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:28,657
I just saved myself...

615
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,498
Did you take classes
in insensitivity?

616
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,537
I was just trying
to break it to you easy.

617
00:51:34,707 --> 00:51:36,334
You failed miserably!

618
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:39,410
Broadzilla, you wouldn't be
here if it weren't for me.

619
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:42,173
And what do you want?
Do you want a thank you?

620
00:51:42,348 --> 00:51:45,476
It's me who should thank you
for that privilege, right?

621
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:46,481
Fine!

622
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:48,483
Thank you.

623
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:49,780
You're welcome!

624
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:56,828
It's kind of like Moonlighting,
isn't it?

625
00:52:07,673 --> 00:52:10,107
It's strange being back
on the old farm.

626
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:14,178
Even after all these years,
it still feels like home.

627
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:16,315
My amazing new friends...

628
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:18,575
have suffered
their first real defeat.

629
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:22,585
That's bad enough, but they've
also lost the opportunity...

630
00:52:22,755 --> 00:52:24,586
to find out
about their mentor...

631
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:27,590
and I'm sure that hurts them
more than anything else.

632
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,093
Each of them deals with
this confusion in his own way.

633
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:34,097
Donatello has found
someone to latch onto.

634
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:37,327
Not even close, zip neck.

635
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,495
The Professor and Mary Ann,
happily ever after.

636
00:52:40,673 --> 00:52:44,575
No way, atomic mouth.
Gilligan was her main man.

637
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,110
They'd be married
and have six kids by now.

638
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,544
Gilligan was a geek,
barfarooni!

639
00:52:49,715 --> 00:52:51,546
You're the geek, camel breath.

640
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,150
Dome head.

641
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:55,953
Elf lips.

642
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:00,055
Let's give this a try.

643
00:53:00,226 --> 00:53:02,558
See if this transplant
worked... fungoid.

644
00:53:02,728 --> 00:53:05,060
Here goes. What are we on?

645
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:06,596
"G."

646
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,961
Here goes, gack face.

647
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:10,932
I'm ready, hose brain.

648
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:21,711
It worked.

649
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:28,444
Leonardo, meanwhile, has kept
a constant vigil with Raphael.

650
00:54:03,956 --> 00:54:05,821
He'll be OK.

651
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:13,328
And then there's Casey Jones...

652
00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:16,195
a nine-year-old
trapped in a man's body.

653
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:19,736
He might almost be cute if it
wasn't for that pigheadedness.

654
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:25,703
He's out with the others,
exercising.

655
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:28,711
Doing something together,
I don't know.

656
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:30,371
Want some help?

657
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:33,248
I don't know.

658
00:54:33,419 --> 00:54:36,752
I am your man.
I am Mr. Fix-it.

659
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:38,253
Let's go.

660
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:39,914
Lead the way, toots.

661
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,086
Toots?

662
00:54:43,262 --> 00:54:45,492
Babe?

663
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:47,521
Sweetcakes?

664
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,393
Princess!

665
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:54,061
Do you want to throw me a clue
here? I'm drowning.

666
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,265
You know what? That's OK.

667
00:54:56,442 --> 00:54:58,137
I'll take care of it myself.

668
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,641
That's up to you.

669
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:02,474
Just don't come around here
asking for my help anymore.

670
00:55:02,648 --> 00:55:04,172
I wouldn't
ask for your help...

671
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:09,447
if you were the last thing
on the face of this planet.

672
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:11,249
It's coming along nicely.

673
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:20,891
What?

674
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,437
You're awake!
How do you feel?

675
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:31,838
What's a guy got to do to get
some food around here?

676
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:34,271
He's awake!

677
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:38,474
He wants some food!
Bring some food!

678
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:41,142
You're going to be OK, Raph.

679
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,981
Get a grip, will you?

680
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:48,888
Listen, Raph...

681
00:55:50,496 --> 00:55:52,555
About what I said before...

682
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:57,625
About not needing you and all...

683
00:55:59,205 --> 00:56:02,299
Leo, don't.

684
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:05,174
Oh, boy, we missed you.

685
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:08,438
It's a Kodak moment.

686
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:19,218
The Turtles are four
once again...

687
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:21,450
and yet, still not whole.

688
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:25,086
A lingering doubt remains...

689
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:27,960
an unknown which
they can't bear to face...

690
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,295
their greatest fear.

691
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:42,907
Your empire flourishes,
Master Shredder.

692
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:44,913
What more from the rat?

693
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:47,917
Nothing. It will not speak.

694
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:51,420
And the boy
who led us to the turtles?

695
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,421
He is still missing.

696
00:56:53,592 --> 00:56:55,583
I do not understand.

697
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:58,594
Why do the turtles
trouble you, Master?

698
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:01,927
They have not been seen
for many days.

699
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:07,437
Something about the way you
described their fighting...

700
00:57:07,606 --> 00:57:09,733
something familiar.

701
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:17,780
Something... from the past.

702
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:28,787
Ointment?

703
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:39,988
Funny, Mikey.

704
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:10,656
What Russian novel, embracing
more than 500 characters...

705
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:13,024
is set in the Napoleonic Wars?

706
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:14,495
War and Peace.

707
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:15,565
He's alive!

708
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:17,361
Thanks, spaz.

709
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:19,003
Splinter's alive!

710
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:21,969
We know, Leo. Of course he is.

711
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,972
We all think he's alive.

712
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,371
I don't think.

713
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:27,603
I know.

714
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:39,216
Leo, if you dragged us
out here for nothing...

715
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,859
Don't worry. I came prepared.

716
00:59:42,027 --> 00:59:43,392
Put those away.

717
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,267
Everybody close your eyes
and concentrate.

718
00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:52,260
Concentrate hard.

719
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:22,657
I am proud of you, my sons.

720
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:25,167
Tonight you have learned...

721
01:00:25,337 --> 01:00:30,172
the final and greatest truth
of the ninja...

722
01:00:30,342 --> 01:00:35,405
that ultimate mastery comes
not of the body...

723
01:00:35,581 --> 01:00:38,345
but of the mind.

724
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:40,485
Together, there is nothing...

725
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:43,815
your four minds
cannot accomplish.

726
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:47,823
Help each other.
Draw upon one another.

727
01:00:47,993 --> 01:00:53,989
And always remember
the true force that binds you...

728
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:58,830
the same as that which
brought me here tonight...

729
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:04,408
that which I gladly return
with my final words.

730
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:09,513
I love you all, my sons.

731
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:49,149
So you actually
played professionally?

732
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:51,152
Before I got hurt.

733
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:53,018
Less than a year.

734
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:56,324
I'm sorry.

735
01:01:56,495 --> 01:01:58,224
So was I.

736
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:01,864
Just a minute.

737
01:02:02,034 --> 01:02:03,399
Guys, I told you...

738
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,732
I hate it when
you do that, all right?

739
01:02:06,905 --> 01:02:08,395
What is it?

740
01:02:09,675 --> 01:02:11,666
It's time to go back.

741
01:02:36,535 --> 01:02:37,695
Home sweet home.

742
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:42,837
Now I know what it's like
to travel without a green card.

743
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:44,873
This isn't bad.
Nice place, guys.

744
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:49,009
You coming or not, dude?

745
01:02:54,386 --> 01:02:55,580
This is great.

746
01:02:55,754 --> 01:02:58,814
First, it's the farm
that time forgot, and now this.

747
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:02,757
Why don't I ever fall in
with people who own condos?

748
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:06,329
Guess it's hard to get
good maid service in a sewer.

749
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:08,989
Maybe you guys should try
Roto-rooter.

750
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:12,331
Would you quit complaining?
It's just for the night.

751
01:03:12,504 --> 01:03:15,837
I still don't see why we don't
get started right away.

752
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:17,669
It's been a long drive, Raph...

753
01:03:17,843 --> 01:03:20,676
and before we go out advertising
to The Foot that we're back...

754
01:03:20,846 --> 01:03:23,246
we could all use
a few hours' sleep.

755
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:25,406
You're right. I'm just...

756
01:03:25,584 --> 01:03:26,573
What's that?

757
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:31,587
Don't shoot!

758
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:33,748
I don't think it's loaded, kid.

759
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:35,917
Danny, what are you doing here?

760
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:38,324
- Hey, where'd he come from?
- Beats me.

761
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:40,328
I ran away from home.

762
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:43,662
Your father's
going to have kittens.

763
01:03:43,835 --> 01:03:44,995
Does this thing work?

764
01:03:46,905 --> 01:03:48,065
Please don't call.

765
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,935
Just let me stay here
the night with you.

766
01:03:50,108 --> 01:03:51,507
We can call in the morning.
I promise.

767
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:52,507
Danny, listen...

768
01:03:52,678 --> 01:03:54,009
Hold on.

769
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:59,207
What is all this talk about
spending the night down here?

770
01:03:59,384 --> 01:04:01,648
You're a claustrophobic.

771
01:04:04,022 --> 01:04:05,182
Do you want a fist in the mouth?

772
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:09,458
I've never even looked
at another guy before.

773
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:13,325
What he means is that you're
afraid of enclosed areas.

774
01:04:13,498 --> 01:04:14,590
Afraid?

775
01:04:16,835 --> 01:04:20,965
What, me?
Is that what you think?

776
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:25,166
I don't have to take
this stuff about being afraid.

777
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,171
I'm going to sleep in the truck.

778
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:41,986
These are good.

779
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:45,828
Do you think
maybe I could have one?

780
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:48,330
ure. Why not?

781
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,660
I could really go...

782
01:04:49,835 --> 01:04:52,167
for a little deep-dish action
right about now.

783
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:54,532
I had some pizza down here
the other day.

784
01:04:54,706 --> 01:04:56,731
There might be some left over.

785
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,413
- Well?
- Question.

786
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:07,575
Do you like penicillin
on your pizza?

787
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,365
"Afraid of enclosed areas."

788
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:56,123
You are here because
the outside world rejects you.

789
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:59,737
And you have
no one to go to, Danny?

790
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:01,395
This is your family.

791
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:05,339
All fathers
care for their sons.

792
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,970
Look out, man.

793
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:46,003
I have not seen you for days.

794
01:07:46,178 --> 01:07:50,808
I've been down
at my hideout a lot lately.

795
01:07:50,982 --> 01:07:55,817
And do you now hide from
your surrogate family as well?

796
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,655
I don't know.

797
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:05,229
l, too, once
had a family, Danny.

798
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:10,832
Many years ago,
I lived in Japan...

799
01:08:11,002 --> 01:08:13,994
a pet of my master Yoshi...

800
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:16,936
mimicking his movements
from my cage...

801
01:08:17,108 --> 01:08:21,670
and learning the mysterious art
of ninjitsu.

802
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:26,682
For Yoshi was one of Japan's
finest shadow warriors.

803
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:32,552
His only rival was a man
named Oruku Saki...

804
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:35,818
and they competed
in all things...

805
01:08:35,994 --> 01:08:41,159
but none more fiercely
than for the love of a woman...

806
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,426
Tang Shen.

807
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:47,836
Shen's love
was only for my master...

808
01:08:48,006 --> 01:08:51,840
and rather than see him fight
Saki for her hand...

809
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:56,174
she persuaded Yoshi
to flee with me to America.

810
01:08:56,348 --> 01:08:58,839
But Saki vowed vengeance.

811
01:08:59,017 --> 01:09:03,977
I remember it well
as my master returned home...

812
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:07,989
to find his beloved Shen
lying on the floor.

813
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,684
And then he saw her killer.

814
01:09:10,862 --> 01:09:14,354
Saki wasted no words,
and during the struggle...

815
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:15,966
my cage was broken.

816
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:19,501
I leapt to Saki's face,
biting and clawing...

817
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:21,400
but he threw me to the floor...

818
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:25,236
and took one swipe with
his katana, slicing my ear.

819
01:09:26,678 --> 01:09:30,079
Then he was gone,
and I was alone.

820
01:09:33,018 --> 01:09:37,011
Whatever happened
to this Oruku Saki?

821
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:40,817
No one really knows.

822
01:09:40,992 --> 01:09:45,326
But you wear his symbol
upon your brow.

823
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:19,327
What are you
doing in there, boy?

824
01:10:19,497 --> 01:10:20,987
Nothing.

825
01:10:30,842 --> 01:10:32,571
Where have you been?

826
01:10:32,744 --> 01:10:35,338
Nowhere.

827
01:10:35,513 --> 01:10:37,845
You're lying to me.

828
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:41,042
And you're hiding
something as well.

829
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:09,006
They're back!

830
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:15,018
Master.

831
01:11:15,186 --> 01:11:17,984
There will be
no mistake this time.

832
01:11:18,156 --> 01:11:20,181
I go myself.

833
01:11:20,358 --> 01:11:22,223
And the rat...

834
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:23,952
kill it.

835
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:33,366
What do you want?

836
01:11:33,538 --> 01:11:35,028
Recognize me now, kid?

837
01:11:35,206 --> 01:11:36,901
What's the deal?

838
01:11:37,075 --> 01:11:37,973
You got to come with me!

839
01:11:38,143 --> 01:11:39,576
What are you talking about,
come with you?

840
01:11:39,744 --> 01:11:41,735
They're going to kill Splinter.

841
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,751
No sweat.

842
01:12:32,263 --> 01:12:35,255
I do hope
there's more of them.

843
01:12:41,906 --> 01:12:43,066
Good!

844
01:12:52,283 --> 01:12:54,274
Where are the keys?

845
01:12:57,422 --> 01:12:59,913
Who are you?

846
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:05,252
The name's Casey Jones.

847
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:09,422
A friend.

848
01:13:14,606 --> 01:13:16,938
Let's get out of here.

849
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:37,092
A little to the right...
A little to the left.

850
01:13:37,262 --> 01:13:39,093
One more time.

851
01:13:39,264 --> 01:13:41,095
A little bit
more like... that!

852
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:43,461
And stop. Perfect.

853
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:47,427
You're a natural, sis.

854
01:13:56,748 --> 01:14:01,811
A little Primatene might just
help to clear that up there.

855
01:14:04,422 --> 01:14:06,720
That's going to cost you,
Tinkerbell.

856
01:14:08,426 --> 01:14:11,327
I don't think
that you're listening.

857
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:19,767
You know,
I'm starting to pick up...

858
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:23,101
on a little language barrier
thing going here.

859
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,158
Fore!

860
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:58,265
I'll never call golf
a dull game again.

861
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:04,937
Gangway!

862
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:19,229
Show-off!

863
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:23,791
What are we just standing
here for? Let's get him!

864
01:15:25,436 --> 01:15:27,904
Do you want to be first, Junior?

865
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:31,000
We have a loyalty
to The Shredder.

866
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:33,006
The Shredder uses you.

867
01:15:33,177 --> 01:15:37,841
He poisons your minds to obtain
that which he desires.

868
01:15:39,784 --> 01:15:43,743
He cares nothing for you
or the people you hurt.

869
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,280
We're a family.

870
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:52,761
Family? Is that what you said?

871
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:58,995
You call this here
and that down there "family"?

872
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,707
Hey, dudes, where you going?

873
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:44,037
Donnie, looks like this one's
suffering from shell shock.

874
01:16:44,215 --> 01:16:46,012
Too derivative.

875
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:50,216
Boy, I guess we can
really shell it out.

876
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:52,219
Too cliche.

877
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,258
Well, it was
a shell of a good hit.

878
01:16:56,427 --> 01:16:58,725
I like it. Step up.

879
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:01,930
Awesome!

880
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:08,172
Where do you think you're going?

881
01:17:13,845 --> 01:17:16,575
Wait for me!

882
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:22,242
God, I love being a turtle!

883
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:09,323
Aw, no more?

884
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:28,616
Does anybody have any idea
about who or what this is?

885
01:18:28,786 --> 01:18:29,878
I don't know...

886
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:33,023
but I'll bet it never has
to look for a can opener.

887
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:37,218
You fight well
in the old style...

888
01:18:37,395 --> 01:18:40,853
but you've caused me
enough trouble.

889
01:18:41,032 --> 01:18:44,024
Now you face...

890
01:18:44,202 --> 01:18:45,999
The Shredder.

891
01:18:48,506 --> 01:18:51,634
Maybe all that hardware's
for making coleslaw.

892
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:53,868
I got him.

893
01:18:59,283 --> 01:19:00,614
This guy's good.

894
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:03,276
Why don't you go next?

895
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:11,021
Match you for it?

896
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:16,156
Damn. Great.

897
01:19:18,803 --> 01:19:20,464
Come on.

898
01:19:27,612 --> 01:19:29,603
So much for family.

899
01:19:34,752 --> 01:19:39,189
Now... at exactly what point...

900
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,416
did we lose control here?

901
01:19:41,592 --> 01:19:46,086
Maybe somebody ought to tell
him that we're the good guys.

902
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:47,253
Any thoughts?

903
01:19:47,431 --> 01:19:49,092
I've only got one thought.

904
01:19:49,267 --> 01:19:51,963
This guy knows
where Splinter is.

905
01:19:56,374 --> 01:20:00,140
Looks like your boys are
going to need a little...

906
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:02,779
Where did he go?

907
01:20:23,768 --> 01:20:25,030
Leftovers.

908
01:20:53,464 --> 01:20:54,692
It's a talent.

909
01:21:11,315 --> 01:21:13,613
Where's Splinter?

910
01:21:13,784 --> 01:21:15,809
Ah, the rat.

911
01:21:15,987 --> 01:21:18,285
So it has a name.

912
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:21,721
It had a name.

913
01:21:23,427 --> 01:21:25,361
You lie!

914
01:21:26,564 --> 01:21:28,293
Do I?

915
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:38,404
He dies.

916
01:21:39,543 --> 01:21:40,840
Weapons.

917
01:21:44,048 --> 01:21:45,208
Now!

918
01:21:54,558 --> 01:21:56,116
Fools.

919
01:21:56,294 --> 01:21:59,024
The three of you
might have overpowered me...

920
01:21:59,196 --> 01:22:01,460
with the loss of but one.

921
01:22:01,632 --> 01:22:06,228
Now your fate will be his!

922
01:22:14,378 --> 01:22:19,441
Yes, Oruku Saki,
I know who you are.

923
01:22:19,617 --> 01:22:23,417
We met many years ago...

924
01:22:23,587 --> 01:22:28,320
in the home of my master...
Hamato Yoshi.

925
01:22:34,632 --> 01:22:36,793
It's him.

926
01:22:41,572 --> 01:22:46,805
Now I will finish
what I began with your ear.

927
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:03,752
Death comes for us all,
Oruku Saki...

928
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:07,022
but something much worse
comes for you.

929
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:09,496
For when you die, it will be...

930
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,810
Without honor.

931
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:35,582
Splinter, are you OK?

932
01:23:38,095 --> 01:23:40,325
We were so worried.

933
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:41,795
Kids.

934
01:24:10,027 --> 01:24:11,892
All right, guys,
let's get to it.

935
01:24:17,034 --> 01:24:19,594
April, here.

936
01:24:20,604 --> 01:24:22,538
What's this for?

937
01:24:22,706 --> 01:24:24,571
It's something I owe you.

938
01:24:24,742 --> 01:24:25,731
Trust me.

939
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:30,847
Dad!

940
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:36,950
Where have you been?

941
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:39,715
I've had the whole city
looking for you.

942
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:42,381
Are you all right?

943
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,425
It's OK, Dad. I'm OK, really.

944
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:47,462
And, Dad?

945
01:24:47,631 --> 01:24:50,623
It's just Dan now, OK?

946
01:24:59,443 --> 01:25:00,671
What have you been up to, freak?

947
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,642
I want some stretchers in here.
Get some doctors.

948
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:03,802
On the sidewalk. Don't move.

949
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:04,970
Get those kids over there.

950
01:25:05,149 --> 01:25:06,707
Don't let them get away.
I want to talk to them.

951
01:25:06,884 --> 01:25:10,183
April, I told you
there were circumstances.

952
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:13,016
I really need you to cover this.

953
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:14,521
I don't know, Charles.

954
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:17,684
Did you know that May Williams
over at Channel Five...

955
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,352
has her own office?

956
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:20,827
You can have an office.

957
01:25:20,998 --> 01:25:22,989
She has her own corner office.

958
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,725
You can have a corner office.

959
01:25:24,902 --> 01:25:27,700
But she's also one of the
highest-paid field reporters...

960
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,032
in New York City.

961
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:30,537
Now you are.

962
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:36,709
You are a tough negotiator,
Charles.

963
01:25:38,048 --> 01:25:40,573
I want some answers.

964
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:45,381
What in God's name
happened out here tonight?

965
01:25:45,556 --> 01:25:48,150
Somebody better talk to me.

966
01:25:50,427 --> 01:25:53,362
Go check out the east warehouse
over at Lairdman Island.

967
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:55,431
You'll get your answers there.

968
01:26:00,437 --> 01:26:01,461
Let's go.

969
01:26:04,575 --> 01:26:07,738
I've been looking
all over for you.

970
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,812
Casey, hi.

971
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,106
"Hi"?

972
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:17,382
I look like I just called
Mike Tyson a sissy.

973
01:26:18,889 --> 01:26:20,880
And all you just say is hi?

974
01:26:21,058 --> 01:26:25,757
You don't need
an ambulance, do you?

975
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:28,194
No, but... I was...

976
01:26:28,365 --> 01:26:29,662
Will you just shut up
and kiss me?

977
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:31,391
I got a report to do.

978
01:26:34,204 --> 01:26:35,535
I love it when you're pushy.

979
01:26:40,477 --> 01:26:44,072
9.95!

980
01:26:48,586 --> 01:26:50,315
That's the way to go!

981
01:26:50,487 --> 01:26:53,115
We were awesome!

982
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:56,054
Bodacious!

983
01:26:56,226 --> 01:26:58,421
Bitchin'.

984
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,164
Gnarly.

985
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:04,130
Radical.

986
01:27:05,135 --> 01:27:06,466
Totally tubular, dude.

987
01:27:06,637 --> 01:27:08,798
Wicked!

988
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:10,804
Hellacious!

989
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,170
Uh, mega...

990
01:27:14,244 --> 01:27:17,407
I have always liked...

991
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:21,779
Cowabunga.

992
01:27:28,492 --> 01:27:30,460
I made a funny.
