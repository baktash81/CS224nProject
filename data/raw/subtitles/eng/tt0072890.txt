1
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:08,815
It has to be from downtown.

2
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:13,546
It's handled through this office,
but it requires downtown approval.

3
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:18,156
I don't know.

4
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,260
It has been submitted.

5
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:58,065
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

6
00:04:58,635 --> 00:04:59,727
Coming.

7
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,948
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,957
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

9
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:29,962
I couldn't say.

10
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:35,735
- You the manager?
- It's a matter of policy.

11
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,937
It- It looks-

12
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:42,644
Keep talking like nothing was wrong.

13
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:46,812
Listen, let me call you back.

14
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,591
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

15
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:59,492
What are you talking about?

16
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,061
Maybe we should take
something smaller, Sonny.

17
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:08,831
You crazy? He started already.
He's got the gun out.

18
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,774
Go on, go over by the door.

19
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,638
Get over by the door.

20
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,056
Freeze!

21
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:10,131
- Nobody move.
- Get over there!

22
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:14,163
Okay. All right,
get away from those alarms.

23
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,332
Come on, get in the center.

24
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,108
He moves, take his head off.

25
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:22,370
Put the gun on him!
Get out of the center.

26
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,775
Sonny.

27
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,841
I can't do it, Sonny.

28
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:31,153
- What?
- I'm not gonna make it.

29
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:35,951
- What? Put it on him.
- I can't do it, Sonny.

30
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,287
Oh, fuck me. Sal.

31
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:43,228
- What?
- Where are you? He can't make it.

32
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,591
Fuck him. Let him go!

33
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:47,695
Come on, Sonny!

34
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,297
All right, let him out.

35
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,909
- Let him out!
- Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

36
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,712
Let him out!

37
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,212
I'm sorry, Sonny.

38
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:02,215
Oh, shit.

39
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,882
- Stevie, don't take the car.
- How do I get home?

40
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,550
Take the subway. We need the car.

41
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,327
Stevie, the keys.

42
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,094
- I'm sorry, Sonny.
- Right.

43
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,732
All right, lock it.

44
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,232
Shit.

45
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:27,800
- What do you want?
- Sonny, there's a girl under that desk.

46
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,644
All right, go.

47
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:44,286
We got rid of him.
So now we just move it along.

48
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,122
- Sal, you got them?
- I got them.

49
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:49,162
Okay. What'd he say to me?
Wait a minute.

50
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,423
Anybody here?
What's this, a squirrel?

51
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,501
Hey, you. Come on. Go ahead.

52
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:57,333
In the back there.
No one's gonna hurt you.

53
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:59,500
Go ahead, get to the back.

54
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:02,541
- Pull the drapes!
- Howard.

55
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:08,874
Now, you, to the back there.

56
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,847
Go to him, right there.

57
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:15,048
Okay. We're gonna move this now.
Just moving along.

58
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:18,319
Come on. Gotcha. Gotcha.

59
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:23,030
We're moving right along, folks. Gonna
get this thing done in half an hour.

60
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,259
We just gotta block...

61
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,231
Oh, shit.

62
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:28,769
Here.

63
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:33,267
Knock out the TV.
There we go.

64
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:37,176
See? No replay, folks.
No alarms.

65
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,540
Let's get you all fixed up
and on your way.

66
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,344
- Right. Is the vault open?
- I can take care of that.

67
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,646
That's good. Let's go.
Take care of it.

68
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,560
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

69
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:53,797
Trip the alarm?
Use the spot key?

70
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,895
- I must've been out of my mind.
- You get your mind right!

71
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:01,065
I'm a Catholic. I don't wanna
hurt anybody, understand?

72
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:03,103
- Yes, sir.
- No alarms.

73
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,932
- No alarms!
- Okay.

74
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,837
No games, all right?

75
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:09,569
Use the other one.

76
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,041
Miriam...

77
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:13,815
...open the safe.

78
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,885
It's all right. It's all right.

79
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:33,398
Here. Put it in this.

80
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,051
What?

81
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,586
That's all there is.

82
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,823
What are you talking about?

83
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,656
They picked it up today.
There's only $1100.

84
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,796
- It's true.
- He's gonna shoot me.

85
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,901
I can't believe it.

86
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,730
I can't believe it.

87
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,638
There's no money here.

88
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:15,301
- Come on, Sonny, let's do it!
- I'm doing it!

89
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:21,450
Too much. This is too much.
This is too much.

90
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,983
All right, come on. Let's go.

91
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:27,356
Somebody- You answer it.

92
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:30,960
Watch him, Sal. You, come with me.
Watch him.

93
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:35,196
- Sit down.
- Who's the head teller here?

94
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,093
- I am.
- Come here.

95
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,502
All right, open it up.

96
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,277
Nope, not all of it.

97
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:51,608
Look, I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

98
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:53,611
Don't play games with me. See.

99
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,843
You take one of these,
go like this...

100
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:57,712
...in here, and out it comes.

101
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,148
You got your 100.

102
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,214
I'll call you back.

103
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:05,490
No, it's decoy money.
It's marked.

104
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:07,426
It's shit.

105
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:08,961
See?

106
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,702
Cheer up, you'll be
the veterans of a robbery.

107
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:17,668
You know the bank
sends you a dozen red roses?

108
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,637
Sal, let him answer it.

109
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,348
Hey, you. Manager. Fucker!
Don't get ideas.

110
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:27,516
I bark, that man there, he bites.

111
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,310
- Believe me, I'm on your side.
- On my side, shit.

112
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,979
Listen, we got young girls here.
You could watch your language.

113
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,695
I speak what I feel.

114
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:43,358
"Watch my language. "
Empty the drawer out.

115
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:47,095
I don't know.
You'd have to find out from him.

116
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:49,196
Traveler's checks...

117
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:51,965
...and the register.

118
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:55,110
The register.

119
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,538
You've got it.
All right, let's go.

120
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,913
I'll take that from you.

121
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,055
All right, Sal, here we go.

122
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,284
Shit.

123
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,502
Come on.

124
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,439
- Shit.
- Sonny, what the hell are you doing?

125
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,872
I'm burning the register here.

126
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:36,551
Moving right along, folks.

127
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,545
All right. Okay.

128
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,283
We're leaving.
Let me have the keys.

129
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:45,158
Howard, give him the keys.

130
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:48,962
- Come on.
- Howard.

131
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,759
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
We're gonna leave.

132
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:59,605
Sonny. Who's that?

133
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:03,542
It's the insurance guy from across
the street. He probably saw the smoke.

134
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:14,988
Please, put out the fire.

135
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:30,337
- I'll get some water.
- Stay right there!

136
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,601
No, no, please, don't-! Don't do it!

137
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:36,674
- I'll call you back later.
- Get rid of him.

138
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,375
- Come on, get rid of him!
- Howard.

139
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,681
Howard.

140
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,656
- Use your head.
- I can handle it.

141
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:01,603
- Everything's all right?
- Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

142
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,339
- Well, then you're okay.
- Yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out.

143
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,103
Okay.

144
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:15,173
- Good.
- Go now. We gave you all we've got.

145
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,149
Okay, we're going.

146
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:19,913
Answer the phone.
Sal, get them in the vault.

147
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,556
Come on, in the vault.

148
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,988
- Where's the money?
- I'm getting it. Got it.

149
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,669
He's gonna come with us. Okay.

150
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:36,738
No, please don't close that door.
How can we breathe?

151
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:38,635
- I can't explain. I'll call-
- Right.

152
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:40,666
Wait a minute.

153
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,435
- Wait a minute. Listen.
- What?

154
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,375
I'll never make this.
I'll have to go to the toilet.

155
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:49,680
Honey, it's no joke.

156
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:52,946
I got a terrible fear
of being locked in.

157
00:15:57,193 --> 00:16:00,094
- Who has to go to the bathroom?
- I do too.

158
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:04,095
- See, now they all wanna go.
- Look, do you wanna check it out?

159
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,236
It's the first door on your right.

160
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,072
All right, Mouth, let's go.

161
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,439
First door on my right.

162
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,404
It's Maria!

163
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:22,575
Listen, I- I forgot she's in there.
It's not her fault.

164
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:25,653
She's always pulling this.
She's supposed to have 10 minutes...

165
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:29,121
- ... she takes 15-
- Shut up! Nobody goes to the bathroom.

166
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:32,261
- Let's go, out.
- We're having a bank robbery.

167
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,095
Mulvaney speaking.

168
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,927
All right, Mouth. Mouth.

169
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,998
- Here's your toilet.
- It's for you.

170
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,568
- What?
- Telephone call.

171
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,771
For you.

172
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,187
Yeah.

173
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:10,423
- What are you doing in there?
- Who's this?

174
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:15,661
Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti,
asshole. We got you by the balls.

175
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:19,465
I'm looking you right in the eye.
Right now I can see you.

176
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:20,734
- Who is it?
- Cops.

177
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:44,291
You come to the front door...

178
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,063
Hang it up.

179
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,182
Get on the side of the street.

180
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,691
Come on, let's go.

181
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,223
How'd that happen?

182
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:19,434
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badly?

183
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:23,730
- Look at my salary. I won't be a hero.
- Did you have a plan or what?

184
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,941
What did you do,
just barge in on a whim?

185
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,676
- Why'd you have to light a fire?
- I told you to get out...

186
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:32,074
...when you could,
but you had to hang around.

187
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,273
He don't have a plan.
It's all a whim.

188
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,010
- Rob a bank, right?
- I had it planned!

189
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:40,086
Only the money should have
been delivered, not taken away.

190
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:44,215
That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave
me the wrong information. That fuck!

191
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,726
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

192
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,365
I wouldn't be arguing with me.

193
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,900
We're all in a barrel together
and we wanna get out of it.

194
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,634
All right, I gotta have time to think.
I gotta think.

195
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:01,240
Oh, shit.

196
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,328
Listen, bastards. You keep away,
or we'll start throwing bodies out...

197
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:22,988
...one at a time. Got that?

198
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,298
Who is this?

199
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,244
There a Jenny here?

200
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,784
- Who's Jenny here?
- That's me.

201
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,318
It's the squirrel.
You got a husband?

202
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:50,323
Yeah? Well, he's on the phone.
Go ahead.

203
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,524
Well, what could I tell him?

204
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,621
I don't know, tell him whatever.
Tell him the truth.

205
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:59,893
What a fucking comedy.
W- N-E-W, plays all the hits.

206
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,660
Listen. Now, don't hang up.

207
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:04,770
- First off, is anybody hurt in there?
- No.

208
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:08,944
Keep away, or we'll start throwing
bodies out, one at a time. You got that?

209
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:12,671
Don't do that. Let me talk to you for
a while. How many people you got?

210
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,111
No, call me back.

211
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,509
- Call me back.
- Excuse me.

212
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:21,014
He said he wants to know
what time you'll be through.

213
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:23,649
What? Oh, girlie, please.

214
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,865
Come on. Let's go.

215
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:43,341
- Where's the back door?
- It's locked on the inside.

216
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,876
Where is it?

217
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:47,241
Through the passageway to the right.

218
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:52,214
Sal, cover them, cover them.

219
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:55,649
You could just go ahead
and cook whatever's there.

220
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:05,327
Ready for riot gang.
3-4, sergeant.

221
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,697
3-4, sergeant. Is that roof-?

222
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,848
- Negative.
- Tell units preset.

223
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:30,616
Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will.

224
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:33,854
- Let's go, come on.
- Honey, I've gotta go now.

225
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,989
I gotta go.

226
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:38,390
I love you too.

227
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:41,533
All right, inside here.

228
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:47,738
Sal, I don't know what happened.

229
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:51,138
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm
or something. I don't know.

230
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:53,748
- But there's a way out of this.
- Listen.

231
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,113
- Were you serious about what you said?
- About what?

232
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,946
About throwing-

233
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:05,728
About throwing those bodies
out the door?

234
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,031
- That's what I want him to think.
- I wanna know what you think.

235
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,138
Because I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

236
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,472
Right. Okay.

237
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:25,974
- I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

238
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,074
All right.

239
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,116
Listen, everybody.
I know we got a problem here, right?

240
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:35,119
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm telling you.

241
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:37,952
All you gotta do is cooperate with me.

242
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,594
Stay cool, and we'll get out of this,
all right?

243
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,821
Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me.

244
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:47,193
First, we'll do things a step at a time.
You gotta go to the bathroom, right?

245
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,131
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

246
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,967
Everybody who has to go
will get to go to the bathroom.

247
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:53,438
We'll do things together.

248
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:56,441
Now, stay cool-
What's the matter with him?

249
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:59,504
He's got asthma.

250
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:03,085
- Asthma?
- Yeah, asthma.

251
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:14,462
Asthma. Shit.

252
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:17,698
All right, I'll take care of that.

253
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,893
- You, what's your name?
- Mulvaney.

254
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:22,127
Mulvaney? Come with me.

255
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:26,965
- He's got asthma and he's a guard?
- They go to guard school.

256
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:29,736
To learn what, how to shoot?
He doesn't have a gun.

257
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:32,973
They earn a $105 a week
to fold the flag in the morning...

258
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:35,411
...straighten up.
I don't know what they learn.

259
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:40,146
All right, I wanna block that door. In
case they try coming in, I can hear it.

260
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:41,914
All right. Let's move this.

261
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:48,420
Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.

262
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,026
Let's get rid of this.

263
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,104
You got kids?

264
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:01,766
I got two kids and I'd like
to see them again.

265
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:04,675
You'll see them again.
You're being cooperative with me.

266
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,782
I got no complaints
against you, whatsoever.

267
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:10,913
Whatsoever.
You got bank insurance?

268
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:14,716
You know I do. You seem
to know a lot about bank procedure.

269
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,349
I know a lot about a lot of things.

270
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:24,526
I just wanna get you
out of here safe, right?

271
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:28,237
What if I take you with me?

272
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:29,894
If you take anybody...

273
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:32,072
...please take me.

274
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:33,967
They'll shoot you, you know?

275
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:35,472
The cops...

276
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:39,613
...don't care about bank insurance.
See what they did in Attica?

277
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:44,110
Forty-two people, they killed.
The innocent with the guilty.

278
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:46,888
Anyway...

279
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:54,187
I won't take you. I'll take one of
them girls, a married one with kids.

280
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,389
Cops don't like it in the papers when
they shoot a married woman with kids.

281
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:03,997
You're all right.

282
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,135
You won't fuck with me, will you?

283
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,222
Come on, set a car.

284
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:27,960
- Help with those barricades.
- Move them back.

285
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:37,870
There's the FBl.

286
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:43,541
How you doing, Sheldon?

287
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,368
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

288
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:10,035
I made an error in judgment.

289
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:13,674
Thought the S.O.B.s would be
remorseful at the sight of a policeman.

290
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:17,573
And you know something?
Nobody said "hostage" yet, understand?

291
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:23,042
- We have a bank robbery here.
- Yeah.

292
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,381
How did the press guys
get through the barrier?

293
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:37,997
We don't know what's up yet.
We're setting up communications.

294
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:41,533
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Can you tell me the situation?

295
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:45,105
We got the- We're setting up
communications now.

296
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:47,002
The perpetrators are in the bank.

297
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:48,541
That's all I can say now.

298
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:52,543
When I get it, you'll get it.
That's all. Okay.

299
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,939
What are you doing
on the fire escape?

300
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:58,676
I said on the roof.
Now, get up on the roof, will you?

301
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,667
- Get the phone company?
- It's being set up now.

302
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:52,669
This phone is gonna be
a direct line into the bank.

303
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:02,075
- Mulvaney speaking.
- Moretti here. Let me talk to him.

304
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,086
- Yeah.
- Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti.

305
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:10,123
- Yeah.
- Okay...

306
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:12,784
...you're in there, we're out here.
What do we do?

307
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,021
- I don't know. What do we do?
- Listen.

308
00:28:15,464 --> 00:28:18,957
- Are the people in the bank okay?
- They're okay.

309
00:28:19,268 --> 00:28:22,761
- You alone or you got confederates?
- I'm not alone.

310
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,438
- I got Sal.
- Sal, what's that for, Salvatore?

311
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,135
Yeah. Sal, he's a killer.

312
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:33,509
We're Vietnam veterans
so killing don't mean anything to us.

313
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,409
- In the Army?
- In the Army, yeah.

314
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:40,121
- So there's you, what's your name?
- Why do you wanna know my name?

315
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:43,789
Give me any name.
Just so I got something to call you.

316
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,728
Let's be reasonable, okay?
Just give me your name.

317
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:57,495
Call me Sonny.

318
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,004
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:00,733
Okay. Now listen, Sonny.

320
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,944
I wanna see
if the people are okay.

321
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,578
- Right.
- Yeah.

322
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,375
Then I wanna work out a way
to get them out of there.

323
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:09,518
I wanna come over without a gun.

324
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,983
You can frisk me so you can trust me.
We'll find a way out of this.

325
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:14,247
Right.

326
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:18,689
I just wanna find some way
that I can trust you too.

327
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:21,395
Not be on the street
where you could just shoot me.

328
00:29:21,697 --> 00:29:24,063
- Some sign, right?
- Right. Like what?

329
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,093
How about letting the people out?

330
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:30,066
Come on, now. Who do you think you're
dealing with? A fucking idiot here?

331
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,671
They're keeping me alive.
I'm gonna let them out?

332
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:35,504
Talk to me. Just talk to me straight.
I'm ready to talk.

333
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:38,510
Okay, okay.
How about giving us the women?

334
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,079
No, I've got women.
That's all I've got here.

335
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,775
Okay. Give me something.
Give me one of them.

336
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:46,284
- Why do you want one?
- It's like a fair exchange.

337
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:48,683
- I'll come over. I won't pack nothing.
- Yeah?

338
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:52,020
I don't know if you'll take me hostage.
It's a sign of trust.

339
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:55,424
- How do I call you back?
- We got a direct line here.

340
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:57,631
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

341
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:01,230
He wants one.

342
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,607
- Him, right?
- Right.

343
00:30:08,277 --> 00:30:09,301
- Right?
- Right.

344
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:12,378
- Okay? He goes.
- Okay.

345
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,072
Can you get up?

346
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:19,078
What are we dealing with here?

347
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:23,583
Hey, you have to keep
checking me out all the time?

348
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:25,421
Yeah.

349
00:30:25,794 --> 00:30:29,162
- Here you are. Your stomach okay?
- It's all right.

350
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,091
He'll need the keys.

351
00:30:32,768 --> 00:30:33,962
Got the keys?

352
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:38,636
- Just the one, Sonny!
- Right.

353
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,948
- Hey, don't fire! Don't fire!
- What are you doing?

354
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:58,423
- Get away from him!
- That's a hostage!

355
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:03,458
- Don't fire, don't fire. Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire!

356
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:05,498
We voted to send him out!

357
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:09,161
- He's one of the hostages!
- Get away from him!

358
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:11,863
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a hostage!

359
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:15,567
He's one of the hostages.
What the hell's the matter with you?

360
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:19,304
I don't give a fuck, goddamn it!
Get away. Get out of here.

361
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,448
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute, Sonny.

362
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:25,017
That was your fault, Sonny.

363
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,815
You know we had
the communications set up here.

364
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,959
We're not set up properly.
We've got 250 cops here.

365
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:32,958
We don't know
what's going on in there.

366
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:36,324
- You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
- That was smart.

367
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:41,331
You say you got nothing but women,
and throw out a guy. What's going on?

368
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:43,469
You wanted a hostage,
I gave you one.

369
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:46,800
- You gonna deal with us or not?
- I gave you one.

370
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:50,341
You did, but you should have picked up
the phone. Come on out.

371
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:53,641
Look. I ain't packing nothing, see?

372
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:55,181
I ain't packing nothing.

373
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,616
You can come out and frisk me.
You can tell.

374
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:03,214
- Why you want me to come out?
- To look at something.

375
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,320
- To see what you're up against.
- I can see it. Why come out?

376
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:10,395
Come out and see it all, all right?
Come on.

377
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:12,901
All right?

378
00:32:13,435 --> 00:32:18,066
Sal is in there with the other people.
Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

379
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,603
I don't forget about Sal.
Come out and look. Okay?

380
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:24,041
Come on. Okay?

381
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:28,274
- I gotta check with him first.
- All right. You don't need that artillery.

382
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:38,251
Sonny, five minutes.
You tell him that.

383
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,221
Take it easy.

384
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:43,156
Get them back.
He's got a white flag.

385
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,298
All right. Okay.
Everything's all right.

386
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:48,698
- See that?
- Right, yeah. Okay.

387
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:52,367
- Come on out, Sonny.
- He's too close here.

388
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,471
Get back!
What the fuck are you doing?

389
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:56,201
- Get them back.
- Get back!

390
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:59,541
- All right.
- Okay. Come on out.

391
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:02,273
Take a look at this. Come on.

392
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,045
Here, look. Look up here. Look.

393
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,381
Look.

394
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,917
Look over here, huh?

395
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:16,956
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

396
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:37,212
You got the militia out here, huh?

397
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,827
Let Sal come look.
What hope have you got?

398
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,128
Come on. Quit while you're ahead.

399
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:53,801
- It's only attempted robbery.
- Armed robbery.

400
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,470
All right, armed, then.
Nobody's been hurt.

401
00:33:56,738 --> 00:34:00,334
Release the hostages. No one
will worry over kidnapping charges.

402
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:01,999
The most you'll get is 5 years.

403
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:03,975
- You'll get out in one year.
- Kiss me.

404
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,239
- What?
- Kiss me.

405
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:09,383
When I'm being fucked,
I like to get kissed on the mouth.

406
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:12,552
You're a city cop, right?
Bank robbery's a federal offense.

407
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:15,985
They got me on kidnapping, armed
robbery. They're gonna bury me.

408
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:18,149
I won't talk to somebody
trying to con me.

409
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,192
- Get someone in charge.
- I am in charge.

410
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:24,025
I won't talk to some flunky pig
trying to con me. What's he doing?

411
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,129
- Get back!
- Why are they moving in?

412
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:30,532
Will you get the fuck back there?
Get back there. Get over there!

413
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,970
- Go on back there, man!
- Get over there!

414
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:35,303
He wants to kill me so bad,
he can taste it.

415
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,810
- No one's gonna kill anybody.
- Attica! Attica! Attica!

416
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:43,008
Attica! Attica! Attica!

417
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:45,517
Attica! Attica!

418
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:49,821
Attica! Attica! Attica!

419
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:51,886
Attica!

420
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:55,223
Attica! Remember Attica!

421
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:03,531
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Your word don't fucking matter!

422
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,500
Come on, calm down.

423
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,211
...to put their guns down!

424
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,279
Put your guns down!

425
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,542
Wasn't for the TV guys,
they'd kill us all.

426
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:21,052
Tell them to put their guns down!
Get back!

427
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:23,123
- Put those guns down!
- Put the guns down!

428
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,919
Get back!
Put those fucking guns down!

429
00:35:26,094 --> 00:35:27,892
Put those guns down!

430
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,392
Put them down! Put them down!

431
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:34,600
Put those fucking guns down.

432
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,963
Put those guns down.

433
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:42,770
Attica! Attica!

434
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:56,113
You got it, man!
You got it, man!

435
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,487
You got it, man!

436
00:35:59,427 --> 00:36:01,487
You got it! You got it!

437
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:08,332
You got it, man! You got it, right?
You got it, right?

438
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:12,804
You got it. You got it.
You got it, right?

439
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:16,006
- headquarters in Washington-
- Robbing a bank?

440
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:19,111
- What was-? What?
- as to the identity of one of the men.

441
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:22,614
Why didn't he tell me
he needed money?

442
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:27,321
He should've come to me
if he needed money.

443
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:30,151
I can't believe it.

444
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:34,489
We know that 8 people
are still being held in the bank.

445
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:38,798
The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...

446
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:42,834
...descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.

447
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:45,266
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

448
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:49,443
We'll switch you now to Ron Cummins
at the bank in Brooklyn.

449
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:52,146
Miss Benson, what's it like inside?

450
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:54,647
They're holding up,
what can you say?

451
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:57,148
- The guy with the gun on us...
- Got a deal?

452
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:01,688
- ... he's a quiet type.
- Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

453
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:05,688
They don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I gotta go now.

454
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,459
What's this with the hands?

455
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,726
She's out, let her stay out.

456
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:13,868
They're my girls.
I'm going back in there.

457
00:37:24,346 --> 00:37:27,315
- Howard, how is he?
- Howard's all right.

458
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:30,675
- Put the TV on.
- Girls, I was interviewed.

459
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:33,844
Sal, looks good.

460
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:37,087
Everybody's out there.
They got the whole media.

461
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:39,318
Television people. Television people...

462
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:42,189
...they wanna talk to you.
They're out there.

463
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,594
Yeah?

464
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:52,502
Hello, Sonny.
Sonny, you're on the air.

465
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:55,266
- Would you answer a few questions?
- Yeah.

466
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:58,269
Why are you doing this?

467
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:04,008
- Hello?
- See, now...

468
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:06,120
...I just saw myself there.
What'd you-?

469
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,051
- Why am I doing it?
- Yes.

470
00:38:08,223 --> 00:38:10,783
- Doing what?
- Robbing a bank.

471
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:18,091
What? I don't know
what you mean by that.

472
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:21,063
I'm robbing a bank
because they got money here.

473
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:24,363
I mean, why do you feel
you have to steal for money?

474
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,039
Couldn't you get a job?

475
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,408
No. Doing what?

476
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:34,910
You know- You know, if you want a
job, you gotta be a member of a union.

477
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,246
See. If you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

478
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,281
What about non-union jobs?

479
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:45,017
What's wrong with this guy?

480
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,956
What do you mean, non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

481
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,291
- Know how much a bank teller makes?
- Not much.

482
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:54,834
Not much. $115 to start, right?
You gonna live on that?

483
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:59,335
I got a wife and kids. How am I gonna
live on that? What do you make a week?

484
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:03,043
- I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.
- No, well, I'm- I'm talking to you.

485
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:06,611
We're entertainment, right?
What do you-? What do you got for us?

486
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,847
What do you want to get for it?

487
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:13,145
- Do you expect to be paid?
- I don't need to be paid. Look.

488
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:17,449
I'm here with my partner and nine
other people, see, and we're dying.

489
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,084
You're gonna see our brains on the
sidewalk. They'll spill our guts out.

490
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:22,753
Gonna show that on television?

491
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,762
Have housewives see that?
Instead of As The World Turns?

492
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:28,300
What do you got for me?
I want something for that.

493
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,528
- Sonny.
- Yeah.

494
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:32,298
- You could give up.
- Give up?

495
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:34,701
- Right. You ever been in prison?
- No.

496
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:38,105
No. Let's talk about something
you fucking know about, okay?

497
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:42,148
- How much you make a week?
- Transmission has been interrupted.

498
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:45,878
Please stand by, we will return
to our special newscast very soon.

499
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:48,613
Hello? What the fuck happened?

500
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:53,217
Guess he didn't appreciate
your language.

501
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:56,694
Fuck him.

502
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:04,638
Sal.

503
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:08,876
Sal.

504
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:27,122
I don't know,
they might deal with us.

505
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:31,627
You know? I mean, I don't know about
that guy out there.

506
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:36,395
But if I get the FBl involved in this,
they might deal.

507
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,198
What do you think?

508
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:48,416
No.

509
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,013
- Sal...
- No!

510
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:53,454
- What's the matter with you?
- You made a promise, didn't you?

511
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:55,418
- Did you promise me something?
- Yeah.

512
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,356
Did you say either we get away clean
or we kill ourselves?

513
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:02,393
- Did you?
- I'm not talking about that.

514
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:04,691
- You believe in keeping your promises?
- Yeah.

515
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:06,561
- Then does it still go?
- Yeah.

516
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,761
- Well, what are you talking about?
- I'm trying to-

517
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:14,773
I ain't going back
to that prison, Sonny.

518
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:21,909
- Yeah.
- Kill them all. Now.

519
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,280
- Take your bayonet, jam it into their-
- Fuck you, you fucker.

520
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,961
Shit.

521
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,021
We ask for a jet.
What do you think?

522
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:14,335
We get a helicopter.

523
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:18,095
We get a helicopter here,
it lands on the roof...

524
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:23,239
...and takes us to a jet.
And we fly the fuck out of the country.

525
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:28,010
Sal. Sal...

526
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,844
...we can do it.

527
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:37,182
Sal. Sal, look.

528
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,954
We got them. We don't even know it.
We got the hostages.

529
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:45,697
We've been looking at this the
wrong way. We make the demands.

530
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,663
They're gonna give us
anything we want.

531
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:57,407
I'm flying to the tropics.
Fuck the snow.

532
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,152
Hey, where's the Mouth?

533
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:10,822
- You ready to go to Algeria?
- Algeria? Yeah, sure.

534
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:12,921
We're all going to sunny climes!

535
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:16,189
Sal, I can make it happen!
I can make it happen!

536
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:20,366
I made it happen so far, right?
I can make it happen.

537
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,702
- Yeah.
- Give me Moretti.

538
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:31,672
Sarge.

539
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:36,081
All of you, go ahead, make phone calls.
Call home or whatever.

540
00:43:36,718 --> 00:43:38,083
We're all going on a trip.

541
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,583
- Yeah, Sonny.
- Yeah. I wanna talk to you.

542
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:43,915
- And I'm coming out.
- Good, I'll be there.

543
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:45,921
Let's go. Come on, he's coming out.

544
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:47,424
Sal.

545
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:50,524
Now, you gotta understand something.

546
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:53,962
If we leave the country,
there's no coming back here.

547
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,535
There's no coming back.

548
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:59,069
If there's anyone you wanna talk to...

549
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,332
...you wanna say goodbye to,
do it now.

550
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:08,346
No.

551
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,449
No.

552
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:13,451
Is there any special country
you wanna go to?

553
00:44:16,424 --> 00:44:18,256
Wyoming.

554
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:22,794
No, Wyoming...
That's not a country.

555
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:26,363
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

556
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,686
All right, put them down!

557
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,898
Put them down. You need a gun?
What do I have?

558
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:01,632
See this here, look.
I got nothing up my sleeve.

559
00:45:01,903 --> 00:45:05,771
I got nothing here either.
Wanna see my pockets? Here.

560
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:09,534
You need that gun, right? Yeah.

561
00:45:10,445 --> 00:45:13,539
Moretti, tell them
to put their guns down!

562
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:17,617
Hey, you, see that?
Put it in your holster.

563
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,120
Put the guns down!

564
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:28,956
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

565
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:32,189
- What's this?
- Put them down.

566
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:36,167
Right. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

567
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:38,697
You got it, right?

568
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:42,065
You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti!

569
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,072
You ready to let these-?

570
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:51,508
You got Maria in there!

571
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:56,256
Maria!

572
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:00,517
He's got a gun in there! Maria!

573
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:04,658
Maria! Maria!

574
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,164
Get him the fuck out of here!

575
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:10,830
How the hell did that happen?

576
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:13,336
- I got Sal in there!
- Take it easy.

577
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:16,476
- Notify the precinct, all right?
- Who the fuck is that?

578
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:19,002
No, no, no.
He's one of them Spanish kids.

579
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:20,714
- Who's Maria?
- She's inside.

580
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:23,610
Sal wants to see Sonny,
says he'll shoot unless he does.

581
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:26,879
- Sal. Sal.
- He's serious. Sonny, he means it!

582
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:30,252
- He means it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

583
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:32,424
It's all right.

584
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:37,427
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- How'd that happen?

585
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:40,227
You got his girlfriend.
You know the Spanish. You okay?

586
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,233
That fuck tried to kill me.

587
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:45,302
- You look all squeezed out.
- Squeezed out, I'm squeezed out.

588
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:48,407
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Wait, let me see.
Let me see your head.

589
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:50,941
- I'm bleeding.
- Let me see it.

590
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:52,643
Let me see it.

591
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:56,375
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

592
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:01,414
It's all right. You want to
talk to me about something?

593
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:04,058
You should've heard that phone call.

594
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:06,590
Calls up, some creep,
says, "Kill everybody. "

595
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:08,593
Everybody wants to kill everybody.

596
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,458
You're gonna get assholes like that
anyhow, right?

597
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:13,032
Right.

598
00:47:17,038 --> 00:47:19,666
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.
I got an offer.

599
00:47:20,975 --> 00:47:22,534
I want a helicopter out of here.

600
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:27,342
And a jet to go wherever I wanna go.

601
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:29,913
So I don't want a little jet,
I want a big one.

602
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:33,587
One with a bar, a piano.
Maybe I wanna go out of the country.

603
00:47:33,754 --> 00:47:37,452
I don't know, Sonny. I don't know
whether a helicopter'll fit in here or not.

604
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,086
I'll check it out.

605
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,524
- It could land on the roof.
- No, that's asphalt.

606
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,823
You know what'll happen,
it'll break through.

607
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:46,694
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

608
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:49,061
Why don't you
bring your superiors here?

609
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:52,000
Why am I talking to you
if you gotta call your superiors?

610
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:56,002
- We don't always see eye-to-eye.
- Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

611
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,575
I'll see what they say.

612
00:47:57,812 --> 00:48:01,043
I talk to them and I ask them,
all right? Then we'll see.

613
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,945
Anything else I can give you?

614
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,353
Yeah, I want you to bring
my wife down here.

615
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:12,220
- What do you give us?
- What do you want?

616
00:48:13,094 --> 00:48:14,527
The women hostages.

617
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:18,632
Oh, man. You know,
there's no talking to you.

618
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,830
That's all I got in there,
I told you, is women.

619
00:48:22,703 --> 00:48:24,728
You gonna talk to me or what?

620
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:29,406
I'll give you one hostage
for each thing you give me, see?

621
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,704
Give me the helicopter,
I give you a hostage.

622
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:33,711
Give me the jet, I give you a hostage.

623
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:36,507
You give me my wife,
I give you a hostage.

624
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:39,015
Then the rest come home on the jet.

625
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:43,180
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

626
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:46,557
In the meantime, you pick out
who you wanna give us.

627
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:49,729
And you tell me where
your wife is, all right?

628
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:54,201
I'm here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor, go, "Sonny what?"

629
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:56,767
I can't believe my ears.
I grab the kids.

630
00:48:56,937 --> 00:49:00,339
I'm telling you, Sonny didn't do it.
It ain't him to rob a bank!

631
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:04,067
It ain't him to steal or hurt anybody
or do nothing wrong!

632
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:07,041
He's never done wrong
since the day I know him.

633
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:11,241
Night before last we're at Coney Island.
I'm looking in the glove compartment.

634
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:13,353
He's got a gun with bullets in it.

635
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:16,182
Things are adding up
how crazy he's acting lately...

636
00:49:16,424 --> 00:49:19,587
...and in with a bad crowd.
So I look at him.

637
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,559
Go on, get in bed. He's yelling
at the kids like a madman.

638
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:26,062
Then he wants me to go on a
kiddie ride. I don't wanna go.

639
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,236
He starts screaming at me.
Sweetheart.

640
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:32,100
He's screaming and screaming.

641
00:49:32,373 --> 00:49:35,104
I say, "What are you
gonna do with the gun?

642
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:37,242
Shoot me and dump me in the river?"

643
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:40,806
I mean, I was scared of him.
I never been scared of him.

644
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:44,882
His mother says we was always fighting,
the cops was always at our house.

645
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,487
I hit him with a jack handle
once in the car.

646
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:50,981
Only I didn't even hit him,
I hit myself.

647
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:54,059
You should've seen the bruise
on my leg, from here to here.

648
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:57,459
He'd put on his hat and coat,
he goes out the door.

649
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,000
So they tell me he did it.
But I don't believe it.

650
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:06,731
Mrs. Wortzik, please, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

651
00:50:06,974 --> 00:50:11,241
His body functions might've done it,
but he himself, he didn't do it!

652
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:23,355
"Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming
about falling into water...

653
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,516
...and not being able
to reach the surface.

654
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:31,155
I begin to breathe heavily
and I wake up in a cold sweat.

655
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:36,097
A friend tells me that my problem
is one of sexual repression. "

656
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:39,807
- Margaret, are you all right?
- No.

657
00:50:39,974 --> 00:50:43,876
What are you, a renegade, a bandit?
What kind of man are you...

658
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,809
...siding with the Indians
against his own people?

659
00:50:46,981 --> 00:50:51,611
- What's your grudge against me?
- I'm taking you in for murder, Kilgore.

660
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:57,548
Yeah?

661
00:50:57,758 --> 00:51:01,058
Are you doing anything
to any of those girls in there?

662
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:03,627
He's back again.

663
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:06,291
Well?

664
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:10,901
Who is this?

665
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:14,205
Look at Margaret.

666
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:18,974
What's the matter with her?

667
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,671
There's no air in here.

668
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:28,348
What happened to the air conditioning?

669
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,161
- I'm sorry, Syl.
- It's all right.

670
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:41,657
- Where's the air conditioning?
- The basement.

671
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:49,407
Sal, I'm gonna go
check the air conditioning.

672
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:52,544
- I'll be right back.
- Sonny.

673
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:59,042
What?

674
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:03,220
I never been up in an airplane before.

675
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:09,886
So? I mean-

676
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:15,262
I mean, it's safe. It's like a car.
It's safer than a car.

677
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:19,766
It's all right, Sal.

678
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:28,776
- I'm gonna go check it now.
- Okay.

679
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:53,799
- Sal!
- What?

680
00:52:53,974 --> 00:52:56,739
- They're coming in the back!
- In the vault! Come on.

681
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,340
- Goddamn it, move!
- Back, get back.

682
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,777
No, don't shoot!

683
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:12,092
That's it, Sonny! Get her in there!
Do it!

684
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:14,795
Get her in there!

685
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,695
Who fired that shot?

686
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,001
Pick her up by the legs.

687
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,899
Who fired the shot?

688
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:27,774
Come on! Move!

689
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,605
Okay, legs. I'll bring her.

690
00:53:31,312 --> 00:53:33,109
- They're moving good.
- What's that?

691
00:53:35,783 --> 00:53:37,341
Sonny?

692
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,346
Sonny! Get me a bullhorn.

693
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:46,057
Sonny!

694
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:53,691
- You got that bullhorn?
- Right. Here.

695
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,502
Hey, Sonny.

696
00:54:00,808 --> 00:54:02,241
Come on out, Sonny.

697
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:06,146
- Sonny.
- Sonny!

698
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:07,508
That's all I need.

699
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,346
- Sonny?
- Sonny!

700
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,454
Come on, take care of that, will you?

701
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:17,988
- Sonny, come on out.
- Sonny, come on out.

702
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:20,525
Go straighten that out,
will you, Carmine? Sonny!

703
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,387
Sonny, come on out.

704
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,829
- Sonny?
- You did fine.

705
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,559
Sonny.

706
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:33,997
Sonny!

707
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:37,474
You son of a bitch,
you wanna get those people killed?

708
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:39,577
Come on out, Sonny.

709
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:45,176
Sonny, come on out.

710
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:50,523
Come on out here, now.

711
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:56,754
Come on out, Sonny. Sonny!

712
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,496
Sonny?

713
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,207
Come on out here, Sonny.

714
00:55:09,209 --> 00:55:11,144
All right, I see it, Sonny. Come on.

715
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,213
Come on. All right, get back.

716
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,881
Wait, wait. People, wait.

717
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:25,923
Keep going.

718
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:29,962
What's the matter with you?

719
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:33,392
- What?
- What're you firing that shot for?

720
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:35,124
We got 250 cops here!

721
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:37,632
Fuck you! What were
they doing back there?

722
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:40,135
What the hell's the matter with you?

723
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:42,405
Are we dealing?

724
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:44,567
- They were trying to get in, right?
- Who?

725
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:47,144
Come on, don't give me that shit.
You know who.

726
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:49,439
- What's going on?
- You're full of shit!

727
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:51,642
Find out what's going on there!

728
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:54,581
- Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know-
- Bullshit!

729
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:56,756
Communications aren't set up yet.

730
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,289
- Get someone to talk to me!
- Goddamn it.

731
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,460
I'm not talking to you anymore.

732
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,130
- Let me talk to you.
- You say this, you do that.

733
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:05,662
Why were they back there?!

734
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:08,196
- I don't know!
- You're full of shit.

735
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,334
That's another force, a tactical force!

736
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:13,130
They like to shoot,
climb through windows!

737
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,309
They like that, right?
Without your orders, right?

738
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:18,010
No. Yes! Without my orders!

739
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:21,042
- You're not coming through the roof?
- I tell you we won't.

740
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:24,673
You're telling me a lot of things,
but you're not doing them.

741
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:26,180
What were they doing?!

742
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,682
- I don't know!
- You can't answer me, right?

743
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:30,380
- You can't answer me.
- What?

744
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:32,149
- You can't answer me.
- Yes, I can.

745
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:34,384
So tell me what they were doing.

746
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:37,186
No communications!
I sent someone back there.

747
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:41,333
I got a guy in there who's gonna kill
somebody. That's your responsibility.

748
00:56:41,502 --> 00:56:44,198
- Not mine, that's yours.
- Wait a minute, hold on. Let's-

749
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:46,305
- We got everything you wanted.
- Oh, yeah?

750
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:49,534
Yeah. We can't get a helicopter in here,
but a bus is coming.

751
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,843
We got a jet coming into Kennedy,
all right?

752
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:55,243
Okay? All right?

753
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:59,050
Now, we got ahold of your wife.

754
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:01,253
Your wife is coming.

755
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:03,720
We reached her
and she's coming here, all right?

756
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:06,749
- Okay?
- Where you going? Where you going?

757
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:09,487
I'm right here.
I thought we were gonna talk.

758
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,864
I thought so too.
But we're not talking.

759
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:13,898
We're trying to get in the back door.

760
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:17,660
Your wife will be here
in about a half-hour. Okay?

761
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:19,863
They're still pointing.
They love to point.

762
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,507
Holster that weapon!
Holster it!

763
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,434
Holster that weapon!

764
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:26,839
You too!

765
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:29,944
All right, come on.

766
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,412
- What?
- What else do you want me to do?

767
00:57:32,686 --> 00:57:34,745
How could you do any better?

768
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,688
We got everything you wanted.

769
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:39,189
I'll do anything I can
to stop anything I can.

770
00:57:41,862 --> 00:57:43,159
Anything else?

771
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:44,955
- Yeah.
- What?

772
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:47,724
I got some people
in there that are hungry.

773
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:50,734
- Can you get some food?
- No problem. What do you want?

774
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:52,565
- Want some pizzas?
- Yeah, all right.

775
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:53,797
Pizzas?

776
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:57,433
Hey, Carmine, get some food,
some pizzas.

777
00:57:58,111 --> 00:57:59,977
Can we get some beer, you think?

778
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,909
No beer.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

779
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,751
Come on. All right? Carmine...

780
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:08,547
...some soft drinks too, okay?
Cokes.

781
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,689
- What else?
- I need some aspirin too.

782
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:12,392
Some lady's not feeling well.

783
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:14,925
You got it. Anything else?

784
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:19,123
- Just don't fucking con me.
- I'm not. Why would I wanna do that?

785
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:23,327
I'm in trouble enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any trouble.

786
00:58:23,937 --> 00:58:25,268
All right?

787
00:58:32,746 --> 00:58:34,077
It's okay.

788
00:58:38,118 --> 00:58:41,315
They can't- They can't bring
a helicopter in here, Sal.

789
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:43,252
Because they can't land it here.

790
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,858
But they're gonna get us a limo bus-
A big bus so we can all get in.

791
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:48,995
And that's how we get to the airport.

792
00:58:50,163 --> 00:58:51,859
It's good. It looks good.

793
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:58,762
You people,
I just ordered you some food, so...

794
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:00,998
I even got her some aspirins.

795
00:59:01,174 --> 00:59:03,268
Okay? So we're moving it along now.

796
00:59:03,777 --> 00:59:06,974
I gotta pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

797
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:09,875
That was a foolish thing
you did back there.

798
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:13,811
Yeah? Foolish thing.

799
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,020
We gonna get the ball rolling?

800
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:21,822
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

801
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,224
I'm working on it, right?
What's it look like?

802
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,798
You think it's easy?
I gotta keep them cool.

803
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,797
I gotta keep all you people happy.

804
00:59:29,036 --> 00:59:31,300
I gotta have all the ideas
and do it all alone.

805
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:33,201
I'm working on it.
You wanna try it?

806
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:36,073
Your food is here, Sonny.

807
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:39,635
You're starting to get on my nerves.

808
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:52,489
All right. Go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right here.

809
00:59:55,562 --> 00:59:57,997
- What do I owe you?
- It's all paid for.

810
00:59:58,165 --> 00:59:59,598
- It's paid for.
- I paid for it.

811
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,393
No, I got it. I got it.

812
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:04,563
Here. Keep the change.

813
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:09,406
What?

814
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:13,607
- You want this?
- Yeah!

815
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:18,108
You like it?

816
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:30,422
Moretti, could you use five?

817
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:40,934
I got a lot for you.

818
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,481
Get back!

819
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:55,611
Get back, goddamn it! Get back!

820
01:00:56,857 --> 01:00:59,951
Let him go. Let him go.

821
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:15,339
More! More! More!

822
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:19,673
More! More! More!

823
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:25,979
Could you open it?

824
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:28,686
Thank you, man.

825
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,185
See you later.

826
01:01:33,426 --> 01:01:35,952
I'm a fucking star!

827
01:01:58,985 --> 01:02:01,352
- Okay, kick...
- Right.

828
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:03,512
- ... out, turn.
- Around.

829
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,150
No, just pick her up and hold her.
She'll be okay.

830
01:02:08,862 --> 01:02:11,627
You're getting your kick good. Here.

831
01:02:20,373 --> 01:02:23,036
Kick, out...

832
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,201
This is where it gets stuck.

833
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,741
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

834
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,007
Here.

835
01:02:30,183 --> 01:02:34,211
- Miriam's making a fool of herself.
- Out.

836
01:02:34,487 --> 01:02:37,685
- Anybody got a cigarette?
- Yeah, I do.

837
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,448
Sylvia, you don't smoke.

838
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:43,559
You don't smoke?

839
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:45,897
No.

840
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:49,067
Why-? Why do you wanna start now?

841
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:52,236
I'm scared to death, that's why.
What, you don't smoke?

842
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,240
- No.
- How come?

843
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,610
- I don't want the cancer.
- Oh, my God.

844
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:06,352
- Give me the cigarette.
- Go ahead, do what you want.

845
01:03:07,988 --> 01:03:10,354
I just think you ought to
take care of your body.

846
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,685
My body? What for?

847
01:03:15,495 --> 01:03:18,192
The body is the temple of the Lord.

848
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:22,130
You're serious.

849
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:26,904
So you rob a bank...

850
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,770
...but you keep your body pure.
Is that it?

851
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:38,100
You gonna smoke or what?

852
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:41,252
Yes.

853
01:03:41,387 --> 01:03:44,415
If I die of cancer,
it'll be half your fault.

854
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:53,927
- No, it's because you're weak.
- Right, I'm weak.

855
01:03:54,633 --> 01:03:57,330
- One, two, three-
- Where's your bullets?

856
01:03:57,569 --> 01:03:59,060
Mulvaney speaking.

857
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:03,442
It's Moretti.

858
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:06,809
Wants to talk to you.

859
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:10,816
- Yeah.
- Will you guys hold it down back there?

860
01:04:10,983 --> 01:04:13,475
Sonny, they're bringing in your wife.

861
01:04:27,466 --> 01:04:29,833
Step back. Stay back.

862
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:32,702
- Where's Moretti?
- Probably in the bar.

863
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:43,048
In the barbershop.

864
01:04:45,584 --> 01:04:47,109
What's that?

865
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:50,078
We went to Bellevue
where you told us...

866
01:04:50,355 --> 01:04:51,755
...said he was his wife.

867
01:04:52,024 --> 01:04:53,753
They were married in a church.

868
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,493
Jesus Christ!

869
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:57,220
Leon.

870
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:02,501
Leon!

871
01:05:03,068 --> 01:05:04,729
Hey, Leon, over here!

872
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:07,535
Leon! Hey, Leon!

873
01:05:07,706 --> 01:05:10,369
- Now move it back.
- Leon, over here!

874
01:05:10,609 --> 01:05:13,374
Leon! Happy birthday!

875
01:05:23,322 --> 01:05:25,518
- Hey, give us some room, huh?
- Watch his head.

876
01:05:30,262 --> 01:05:31,787
He's a queer?

877
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:35,066
Sarge. Sarge, he wants you!

878
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:39,631
Come on, get the shield out of here.
I don't need it now.

879
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:42,169
Where were you four hours ago,
when I needed it?

880
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,910
He's not gonna shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what?

881
01:05:45,144 --> 01:05:47,305
What happened? Is he all right?

882
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:50,913
- He's a little groggy right now, okay?
- No, let me talk to him.

883
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:54,348
Let me get him on his feet and
call you back. Shut the fucking door.

884
01:05:57,356 --> 01:06:00,291
Stop the noise in here.
I don't wanna hear a fucking sound!

885
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:01,583
Typewriter!

886
01:06:02,427 --> 01:06:04,487
- Get off the fucking phone!
- Sarge.

887
01:06:04,963 --> 01:06:06,260
Now!

888
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:08,999
Give me some water, all right?

889
01:06:11,503 --> 01:06:14,166
Leon? Leon.

890
01:06:14,873 --> 01:06:18,776
You all right, Leon? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

891
01:06:19,812 --> 01:06:22,872
Oh, God.
They shot me with, like, unreal!

892
01:06:23,148 --> 01:06:24,946
You gotta get ahold of yourself...

893
01:06:25,384 --> 01:06:28,513
...so you can talk to him,
see if he'll come out of the bank.

894
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:30,121
Oh, no.

895
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:32,951
He's got eight people, and a kid
named Sal. You know him?

896
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:36,625
- No, not really.
- Says he's gonna shoot these eight people.

897
01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:40,356
I can't help it.
I can't stop him from anything.

898
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:42,327
Who will he listen to, then?

899
01:06:42,601 --> 01:06:45,502
I can't- I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to anybody.

900
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:48,333
He's been-
He's been crazy all summer.

901
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:51,471
He's tried to kill me since June.

902
01:06:52,978 --> 01:06:56,346
Yeah. Put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

903
01:06:56,515 --> 01:06:59,484
- He beat up my friends.
- Did you contact the police?

904
01:07:00,686 --> 01:07:02,347
What good would that do?

905
01:07:02,688 --> 01:07:06,522
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. And it wouldn't stop him.

906
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:11,162
- Somebody's gotta stop him.
- You don't understand. He's crazy.

907
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,759
He's got a wife, children.

908
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,061
He's a wonderful father.

909
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:22,031
His mother...

910
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:26,440
...you should see her. Together with
his father, they're like a car wreck.

911
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:29,881
It just- It just rolls off his back.

912
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:33,175
He sees them.
He pays the rent. Unbelievable.

913
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:39,183
I was the one who wanted to get
married. He didn't really want it...

914
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:42,052
...but he did it.
I don't know why.

915
01:07:43,028 --> 01:07:44,655
Why did you wanna get married?

916
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:50,863
I thought it would help me.

917
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:54,667
But it didn't.

918
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,305
I- I was so confused.
I was doing...

919
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:00,070
...insane things.

920
01:08:01,213 --> 01:08:02,703
What sort of things, Leon?

921
01:08:07,552 --> 01:08:09,179
After the wedding...

922
01:08:09,888 --> 01:08:12,880
...I ran off for 10 days
to Atlantic City.

923
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:15,987
Sonny was frantic.

924
01:08:16,194 --> 01:08:20,325
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where I was, who I was with.

925
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,629
I couldn't explain the things I did.

926
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:27,201
So I went to a psychiatrist...

927
01:08:27,506 --> 01:08:29,064
...who told me...

928
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:33,702
...that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

929
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:45,146
So right away Sonny wanted to give me
money for the sex-change operation.

930
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:47,358
But where was he gonna get it?

931
01:08:47,626 --> 01:08:50,118
$2500?

932
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:53,026
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears already.

933
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:55,130
He needed the money
for your operation?

934
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:58,428
It drove him crazy. He-

935
01:08:58,603 --> 01:09:01,038
He would fly into these rages.

936
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,136
And I got more depressed than ever.

937
01:09:04,443 --> 01:09:06,877
I knew I'd never get my operation.

938
01:09:09,781 --> 01:09:13,650
So I tried to kill myself.
I took about a half a pound of pills.

939
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:18,313
Blues, reds, yellows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

940
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,756
And I wound up in a hospital.

941
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:25,055
And Sonny comes there...

942
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,526
...and he just looks at me.

943
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,361
And he says:

944
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:32,570
"Why, Leon?

945
01:09:32,904 --> 01:09:35,533
When things were going so good?"

946
01:09:40,178 --> 01:09:42,044
Don't you think-?

947
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:45,879
Leon, don't you think
he sort of did it for you?

948
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:51,512
Yeah, I guess so.

949
01:09:53,191 --> 01:09:56,093
Don't you think you owe it to him
to try to get him out?

950
01:09:57,596 --> 01:09:59,723
I can't talk to him.

951
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,031
You're up to your neck in it, Leon.
You're an accessory.

952
01:10:05,437 --> 01:10:10,341
- No, no. They can't hold me responsible.
- Wait, you could help us a little.

953
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:11,733
I'm afraid.

954
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:15,403
Just talk to him for a minute.
How can he hurt you on the phone?

955
01:10:16,548 --> 01:10:20,917
- All you're gonna be is on the phone.
- I can't. I don't know what to...

956
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:24,451
- Just talk with him on the phone.
- I can't. No.

957
01:10:30,395 --> 01:10:32,523
You think about it, Leon.

958
01:10:33,532 --> 01:10:34,760
Yeah.

959
01:10:39,571 --> 01:10:43,030
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- What do you mean, won't talk to me?

960
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:46,909
- Let me work on it.
- I thought you were doing that.

961
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,746
He don't wanna talk to me.

962
01:11:12,404 --> 01:11:16,136
Police are questioning Leon Shermer,
a 26-year-old admitted homosexual...

963
01:11:16,408 --> 01:11:21,141
...who claims to have married
one of the bank robbers last November.

964
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:24,749
According to sources in the barbershop
where Leon is being held...

965
01:11:24,983 --> 01:11:26,508
...Leon has reportedly said...

966
01:11:26,785 --> 01:11:30,153
...they were married in an
official ceremony by a Father Burke.

967
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,491
Leon's story has been confirmed.

968
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,090
Seven bridesmaids, all male,
Sonny's mother and 70 other guests...

969
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:41,766
...all members of the gay community,
were present.

970
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:48,000
We've been able to obtain
a still photograph of Leon in his gown.

971
01:11:49,508 --> 01:11:50,975
Leon has confirmed...

972
01:11:51,209 --> 01:11:56,204
...that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost $700.

973
01:11:57,616 --> 01:11:59,641
We have not confirmed the story...

974
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:04,116
...with the priest. But we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked.

975
01:12:04,556 --> 01:12:09,721
Phone calls have arrived from
various factions of the gay community.

976
01:12:09,995 --> 01:12:13,988
Some in support of Sonny and his
actions, others totally condemning...

977
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,896
...the present events
and calling the marriage a farce...

978
01:12:17,068 --> 01:12:21,528
...and, quote, "A case
of sheer exhibitionism. " End quote.

979
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:26,970
Our coverage of the Brooklyn robbery
where two homosexuals hold hostages...

980
01:12:27,145 --> 01:12:29,478
...for their demands of
a helicopter, a jet...

981
01:12:29,648 --> 01:12:33,084
Sonny. Sonny, they said,
"Two homosexuals in the bank. "

982
01:12:33,251 --> 01:12:35,982
- Right on TV. You hear?
- What difference does it make?

983
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:39,590
They're gonna say anything they want.
Let them say it.

984
01:12:44,763 --> 01:12:46,094
Well, I'm not a homosexual.

985
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:53,032
Tell them to get that right.
That's going out on the TV.

986
01:12:57,275 --> 01:13:01,872
Sal, what am I supposed to do? I can't
control what they say on television.

987
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:06,917
What should I do? I'm doing
everything I can. I can't do that.

988
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:09,210
I mean, they're-

989
01:13:11,523 --> 01:13:13,116
Look, Sal.

990
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:17,688
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

991
01:13:17,862 --> 01:13:19,694
Whatever they say, it don't matter.

992
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,429
It'll be all right.

993
01:13:36,581 --> 01:13:38,379
What's the matter with you?

994
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:42,944
You shouldn't let something like that
spoil your fun, you know?

995
01:13:43,121 --> 01:13:45,283
You gotta get fun out of life.

996
01:13:50,762 --> 01:13:51,957
Shit.

997
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,155
Where's the goddamn jet?

998
01:13:55,233 --> 01:13:58,066
They're always screaming overhead,
going somewhere...

999
01:13:58,236 --> 01:14:00,398
...when you don't need them,
you know?

1000
01:14:24,095 --> 01:14:28,362
What are you gonna tell the pilot
when you get on the plane?

1001
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:31,432
You have to know, right?

1002
01:14:31,603 --> 01:14:33,799
- Did you know Holland's pretty good?
- Use this.

1003
01:14:34,072 --> 01:14:37,599
- Holland?
- They sheltered people during the war.

1004
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:39,973
They're good people.

1005
01:14:40,178 --> 01:14:41,646
Where's Holland?

1006
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,077
- It's right up...
- It's over there.

1007
01:14:47,852 --> 01:14:49,184
She doesn't have a map.

1008
01:14:49,354 --> 01:14:51,584
It's got good chocolate.

1009
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:56,484
Come on, get in the vault.
Get in the vault. Come on.

1010
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:57,685
Quickly!

1011
01:15:09,874 --> 01:15:12,673
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

1012
01:15:16,314 --> 01:15:17,714
Sonny.

1013
01:15:19,184 --> 01:15:21,914
- Come on out for a second, please.
- It's him, Sonny.

1014
01:15:22,353 --> 01:15:24,822
Come on out here.
I wanna talk to you a second.

1015
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:29,755
- Come on, Sonny.
- Sonny.

1016
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,002
Sonny.

1017
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:41,330
Come on out, Sonny.

1018
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,931
Sonny?

1019
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,548
Come on out a minute.

1020
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:53,242
That's it, Sonny.

1021
01:15:58,957 --> 01:16:01,448
Hey, Sonny!

1022
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:06,754
Moretti!

1023
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:13,598
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on.

1024
01:16:13,972 --> 01:16:15,667
Moretti!

1025
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:18,299
Who are you?

1026
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:21,677
FBl, Sheldon.

1027
01:16:24,249 --> 01:16:25,978
Oh, good.

1028
01:16:26,184 --> 01:16:29,154
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started, huh?

1029
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,118
Look, get the lights back on...

1030
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:34,554
...and the air conditioner.
We got no air conditioning.

1031
01:16:34,793 --> 01:16:38,388
- No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
- Favors?

1032
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:40,994
You been doing me favors all night?

1033
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:45,567
I have a jet, limo will be here
in a half hour.

1034
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:49,634
I want the hostages.

1035
01:16:50,408 --> 01:16:52,069
No, no, no. Bullshit.

1036
01:16:52,844 --> 01:16:55,336
I'd like to work with you on this,
not against you.

1037
01:16:55,613 --> 01:16:57,843
The hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

1038
01:16:59,984 --> 01:17:01,281
When do I get them?

1039
01:17:03,021 --> 01:17:04,614
Didn't they tell you anything?

1040
01:17:06,524 --> 01:17:08,458
I'd like to hear it from you.

1041
01:17:10,361 --> 01:17:14,730
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

1042
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,325
One hos- One hostage for the jet.

1043
01:17:18,803 --> 01:17:22,239
Then I get to the airport.
I go into the plane, check it all out.

1044
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:24,999
And if it's okay,
then they all come out.

1045
01:17:27,145 --> 01:17:29,477
- I wanna go inside.
- Why?

1046
01:17:29,747 --> 01:17:33,047
- To see if everybody's all right.
- They're all right.

1047
01:17:33,384 --> 01:17:34,943
No, I have to see.

1048
01:17:44,062 --> 01:17:45,529
You got guts.

1049
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:49,028
Think if we slit their throats,
we're gonna let you out?

1050
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:51,028
I have to see.

1051
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:04,641
I gotta check with my partner.

1052
01:18:12,056 --> 01:18:14,548
The FBl, Sal. They're coming in.

1053
01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:23,834
Hey, pussycat. There you go.

1054
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,572
You'd like to kill me?
Bet you would.

1055
01:18:32,844 --> 01:18:36,041
I wouldn't like to kill you.
I will if I have to.

1056
01:18:36,314 --> 01:18:38,214
It's your job, right?

1057
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,009
The guy who kills me...

1058
01:18:41,252 --> 01:18:45,451
...I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not because it's his job.

1059
01:18:52,063 --> 01:18:55,192
Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBl.

1060
01:19:06,778 --> 01:19:10,305
Just wanna make sure all you
young ladies are all right in here.

1061
01:19:10,481 --> 01:19:11,778
- Look...
- We're all right.

1062
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:15,078
...they asked for the jet hours ago.
Now, what are you doing?

1063
01:19:15,253 --> 01:19:18,552
That's being set up.
We'll have you out in a couple of hours.

1064
01:19:18,756 --> 01:19:21,919
- A couple of hours?
- Why not give them what they want?

1065
01:19:22,093 --> 01:19:25,063
They'll get what they want. We
wanna be sure we get what we want.

1066
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:28,165
That's to get you all out of here safe.

1067
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:31,165
You two boys too.

1068
01:19:31,469 --> 01:19:32,800
That's close enough.

1069
01:19:36,574 --> 01:19:39,908
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's two homosexuals in here.

1070
01:19:41,012 --> 01:19:42,912
I will, Sal.

1071
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:46,941
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

1072
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,668
You handle yourself well, Sonny.

1073
01:20:14,145 --> 01:20:18,173
A lot of men would have choked. We
might have had a death on our hands.

1074
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:20,918
But you handled it. I respect that.

1075
01:20:21,653 --> 01:20:24,679
Now, don't you try to take Sal.
We'll handle him.

1076
01:20:25,657 --> 01:20:29,525
- Just sit tight and you won't get hurt.
- Wait. What are you talking about?

1077
01:20:31,329 --> 01:20:33,161
You just sit quiet.

1078
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:36,497
We'll handle Sal.

1079
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,504
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

1080
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,949
What'd he say?

1081
01:21:03,194 --> 01:21:05,219
He was just talking
about arrangements.

1082
01:21:05,396 --> 01:21:08,389
I talked to him about the TV, Sal.
It's gonna be all right.

1083
01:21:09,267 --> 01:21:10,325
That's all?

1084
01:21:11,235 --> 01:21:12,532
Yeah.

1085
01:21:14,038 --> 01:21:16,234
Why couldn't he say that in here?

1086
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:21,974
I don't know. He wanted to show me
how the bus is coming in.

1087
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:33,914
What's the matter?

1088
01:21:35,126 --> 01:21:37,254
Somebody get a glass of water.

1089
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,226
Got a hankie?

1090
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,626
They poisoned the pizza.

1091
01:21:43,868 --> 01:21:47,497
It's not the pizza.
He's got diabetes.

1092
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:52,103
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hold it.

1093
01:21:52,877 --> 01:21:55,903
What can we do for you,
Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1094
01:22:00,718 --> 01:22:02,880
Is there a doctor out here?

1095
01:22:06,023 --> 01:22:08,083
We need a doctor in here.

1096
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:12,453
We need a doctor.

1097
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:16,824
- What's wrong?
- The manager, he's diabetic.

1098
01:22:17,034 --> 01:22:18,593
He don't look good.

1099
01:22:32,283 --> 01:22:33,808
I gotta search you.

1100
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:39,549
Watch out he don't kiss you, doc.

1101
01:22:40,925 --> 01:22:43,155
Looking for an antonym.

1102
01:22:45,096 --> 01:22:46,495
Okay.

1103
01:22:52,436 --> 01:22:53,768
Just him.

1104
01:22:55,173 --> 01:22:56,572
Sonny.

1105
01:22:57,842 --> 01:23:01,676
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1106
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:16,884
He's coming on.

1107
01:23:25,636 --> 01:23:26,694
Hello.

1108
01:23:27,805 --> 01:23:29,170
Hello?

1109
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:30,906
Hello, Leon?

1110
01:23:31,342 --> 01:23:33,868
Hello. Hello, Sonny.

1111
01:23:34,478 --> 01:23:35,844
What happened?

1112
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:38,175
How you-? How you doing?

1113
01:23:38,649 --> 01:23:41,551
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1114
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:45,212
Yeah, I know. You know,
I thought you'd never get out.

1115
01:23:46,357 --> 01:23:49,418
Hot. I never thought
I'd get out this way, I'll tell you.

1116
01:23:49,727 --> 01:23:51,161
Yeah.

1117
01:23:51,662 --> 01:23:53,255
So how you doing?

1118
01:23:55,233 --> 01:23:57,565
- I'm a little shaky.
- Oh, yeah?

1119
01:23:57,735 --> 01:24:01,137
Moretti told me that you were
all drugged up...

1120
01:24:02,139 --> 01:24:06,770
...so I figured that's why you didn't
talk to me. I was wondering why.

1121
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:08,708
It was really terrible, you know?

1122
01:24:08,946 --> 01:24:12,212
I mean, you walk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1123
01:24:12,383 --> 01:24:14,943
And then they start sticking
things in your arm.

1124
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,952
I mean, how do they expect you to get
uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?

1125
01:24:21,459 --> 01:24:25,293
I'm- I'm just starting
to come out of it now.

1126
01:24:25,463 --> 01:24:29,092
- So...
- So how are you?

1127
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,731
I'm fine.

1128
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:34,599
This is something, huh?

1129
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:41,138
Yeah, yeah.

1130
01:24:41,312 --> 01:24:44,805
I don't know, Leon, you know?
I'm dying here.

1131
01:24:45,116 --> 01:24:46,777
I'm dying.

1132
01:24:48,452 --> 01:24:51,684
Don't you ever listen to yourself
when you say you're dying?

1133
01:24:51,923 --> 01:24:55,051
- Did you ever listen to yourself?
- What are you talking-?

1134
01:24:55,293 --> 01:24:58,786
What do you mean, what am I
talking about? You're dying.

1135
01:24:58,996 --> 01:25:02,933
Do you know that you say that
to me every day? "I'm dying. "

1136
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,070
You're not dying.
You're killing the people around you.

1137
01:25:06,304 --> 01:25:09,762
Leon, don't give me that shit.
I don't need the deep shit now!

1138
01:25:10,007 --> 01:25:12,476
You don't realize what
the things you do mean.

1139
01:25:12,743 --> 01:25:15,235
Yeah? I know what I do.

1140
01:25:15,713 --> 01:25:17,408
You stick a gun
to somebody's head.

1141
01:25:17,648 --> 01:25:21,346
- I don't know what I'm doing sometimes.
- Obviously, you don't.

1142
01:25:21,619 --> 01:25:23,917
"Go to sleep
so it won't hurt when I shoot. "

1143
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:27,450
What do you think
I've been doing in the hospital?

1144
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:30,321
I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1145
01:25:30,494 --> 01:25:32,121
- Right?
- Yeah.

1146
01:25:32,296 --> 01:25:34,822
So now I'm talking to you
on the phone again, right?

1147
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:37,795
I- I- I got no job.
I don't have friends.

1148
01:25:38,035 --> 01:25:40,732
I can't live.
I have to live with people.

1149
01:25:42,606 --> 01:25:44,472
This death business, I'm sorry.

1150
01:25:44,742 --> 01:25:47,837
I don't know what I'm getting here
with that shit.

1151
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:52,176
You know, what am I supposed
to say to that shit? This is going on.

1152
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:54,884
- And you're giving me that shit.
- I'm sorry.

1153
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:56,814
You know what's happening with me.

1154
01:25:57,054 --> 01:25:59,683
You know the pressures
I've been having, right?

1155
01:25:59,957 --> 01:26:03,257
I got all these pressures. You know it.
You're in that hospital...

1156
01:26:03,494 --> 01:26:06,657
...with them tubes coming out
and want that operation, right?

1157
01:26:06,864 --> 01:26:09,492
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1158
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:14,400
Everybody needs money.
So you needed money? I got you money.

1159
01:26:14,672 --> 01:26:18,404
- I didn't ask you to rob a bank!
- I know you didn't ask me.

1160
01:26:18,576 --> 01:26:22,774
Look, I'm not putting this
on anybody, you know?

1161
01:26:23,014 --> 01:26:25,983
Nothing on nobody.
I did this on my own. You see?

1162
01:26:26,217 --> 01:26:29,414
All on my own, I did it.
But I just want you to know something.

1163
01:26:29,587 --> 01:26:32,784
I want you to know
that I'm getting out of here.

1164
01:26:33,023 --> 01:26:35,151
I'm getting a plane out of here...

1165
01:26:35,326 --> 01:26:39,228
...and I just wanted you to know it.
And I wanted you to come down...

1166
01:26:39,497 --> 01:26:42,432
...and I wanted to just say
goodbye to you.

1167
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,999
Or, if you wanted to,
you can come with me.

1168
01:26:46,237 --> 01:26:48,899
You're free to do what you want.
That's just what...

1169
01:26:49,173 --> 01:26:51,073
...I wanted to say to you, that's all.

1170
01:26:53,244 --> 01:26:55,576
- I'm- I'm free to do what I want, huh?
- Right.

1171
01:26:55,846 --> 01:27:00,614
I been trying to get away from you for
months and I'm going with you on a trip?

1172
01:27:00,885 --> 01:27:02,876
Where? Where are you going?

1173
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,223
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1174
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:09,517
So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know yet.

1175
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,320
Why are you going to Algeria?

1176
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:16,923
I don't know why. They got
a Howard Johnson's there.

1177
01:27:17,101 --> 01:27:20,036
Howard Johnson's. You're warped, you
know? You're really warped.

1178
01:27:20,237 --> 01:27:22,638
I'm warped. I know I'm warped.

1179
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,534
God, Algeria. It's-

1180
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:31,412
You know, they walk around
with masks on, things on their heads.

1181
01:27:31,649 --> 01:27:34,846
- They're a bunch of crazy people.
- What am I supposed to do?

1182
01:27:35,086 --> 01:27:38,214
- You could have picked a better place.
- Like where?

1183
01:27:38,456 --> 01:27:40,617
Sweden? Denmark?

1184
01:27:42,726 --> 01:27:44,991
Yeah, I like that. Yeah.

1185
01:27:46,797 --> 01:27:49,926
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1186
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:54,229
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1187
01:27:54,572 --> 01:27:58,133
I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. Think you got problems?

1188
01:28:01,645 --> 01:28:03,409
So, Sal is with you?

1189
01:28:03,647 --> 01:28:07,106
Oh, boy.
You'd be better off giving up.

1190
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:11,486
I'm not giving up, because
why have I done this so far?

1191
01:28:11,755 --> 01:28:15,522
I've gone so far with this,
and why should I give up now?

1192
01:28:16,026 --> 01:28:17,619
I can't give up.

1193
01:28:20,464 --> 01:28:24,196
- Would you do me a favor then?
- Yeah, what?

1194
01:28:26,537 --> 01:28:30,769
These guys that have me
down here, you know...

1195
01:28:31,509 --> 01:28:34,842
...they think I'm part of the plot
to rob the bank.

1196
01:28:35,012 --> 01:28:38,039
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy.

1197
01:28:38,215 --> 01:28:40,684
They're bullshitting you,
giving you a snow job.

1198
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:43,545
- They told me I was an accessory.
- No.

1199
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:46,552
That's just a con job on you.
Don't listen to that.

1200
01:28:46,824 --> 01:28:50,852
I have to listen to it.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1201
01:28:51,028 --> 01:28:53,725
- Leon, you're not going to prison.
- How do you know?

1202
01:28:53,998 --> 01:28:55,829
Because I know. Believe me.

1203
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,366
- Look, please, just tell them.
- Please what?

1204
01:28:58,669 --> 01:29:00,068
Tell them what?

1205
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:04,297
That you didn't do it?
Are they on the phone now?

1206
01:29:04,475 --> 01:29:06,739
- Are they on the phone now?
- Yeah.

1207
01:29:07,044 --> 01:29:09,672
That's great, Leon.
That's really terrific.

1208
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:12,506
You talk to me with them on the phone.
Really smart.

1209
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,650
- I have no choice!
- What do you mean?

1210
01:29:14,885 --> 01:29:18,822
What am I supposed to do? There's
7000 fucking cops all around me.

1211
01:29:19,056 --> 01:29:21,024
- Who's on now?
- Look, don't lay it on me!

1212
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:24,319
I'm not, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1213
01:29:24,562 --> 01:29:26,530
You knew what was happening, right?

1214
01:29:26,764 --> 01:29:28,027
Yeah!

1215
01:29:28,265 --> 01:29:30,495
I wanna know
who's on the phone now.

1216
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,897
Moretti. Moretti, is that you?

1217
01:29:36,473 --> 01:29:37,964
Hello.

1218
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:43,073
Will somebody talk to me?
Somebody gonna talk to me or what?

1219
01:29:43,347 --> 01:29:46,510
- They on the phone now?
- They won't talk to you.

1220
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:51,085
All right. He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1221
01:29:52,489 --> 01:29:55,220
All right. Now, will you get
the fuck off the phone?

1222
01:29:55,392 --> 01:29:56,985
Are they off the phone?

1223
01:30:00,531 --> 01:30:01,555
Yeah.

1224
01:30:01,732 --> 01:30:05,191
Terrific. That really convinced them.
That's what they wanted to know.

1225
01:30:05,369 --> 01:30:07,337
- Did I do it for you?
- Yeah, thank-

1226
01:30:07,504 --> 01:30:08,733
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

1227
01:30:10,774 --> 01:30:12,902
So now what?
What are you gonna do?

1228
01:30:13,544 --> 01:30:15,307
Well, I thought...

1229
01:30:16,714 --> 01:30:18,807
...that I would
go back to the hospital.

1230
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:23,213
They're really nice there. They
seem like they're trying to help me.

1231
01:30:23,654 --> 01:30:25,747
That's good, then.
You found something.

1232
01:30:26,557 --> 01:30:28,548
Yeah, I don't know if I have or not.

1233
01:30:30,394 --> 01:30:32,624
So are you gonna still
have the operation?

1234
01:30:32,896 --> 01:30:35,388
Yeah. Yeah.

1235
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:39,229
So then, what am I
supposed to say to you?

1236
01:30:45,743 --> 01:30:47,040
Thanks a lot...

1237
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:50,269
...and bon voyage.

1238
01:30:51,615 --> 01:30:53,675
Yeah, right.
See you sometime.

1239
01:30:53,917 --> 01:30:56,648
Yeah. I'll see you in my dreams, huh?

1240
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,048
Right, I'll write a song.

1241
01:31:02,459 --> 01:31:06,692
- I don't know. Life's so funny.
- You said a mouthful, sweetheart.

1242
01:31:11,835 --> 01:31:13,826
Well- Goodbye, huh?

1243
01:31:17,474 --> 01:31:18,771
Bye.

1244
01:31:45,169 --> 01:31:46,636
- Yeah.
- Give me- Can I have-?

1245
01:31:46,804 --> 01:31:49,136
- Moretti. Moretti.
- Hey. Hey.

1246
01:31:49,306 --> 01:31:52,333
You cut off the incoming calls.
Can I have a line?

1247
01:31:52,509 --> 01:31:54,978
I wanna talk to my wife
and to my kids.

1248
01:31:55,212 --> 01:31:57,544
He wants an outside line,
is it all right?

1249
01:31:59,149 --> 01:32:02,415
- I want a line.
- Yeah, Sonny, I'm getting it.

1250
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,754
I could call anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1251
01:32:07,624 --> 01:32:09,149
The Pope, an astronaut...

1252
01:32:10,494 --> 01:32:12,189
...the wisest of the wise.

1253
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:15,490
Who do I have to call?

1254
01:32:17,634 --> 01:32:19,899
I just don't know what to do.

1255
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:28,741
- Hello.
- Angie.

1256
01:32:28,912 --> 01:32:31,438
Sonny, Jesus!
I was watching it on TV.

1257
01:32:31,648 --> 01:32:35,642
- Yeah. So where are the kids?
- I sent them to the neighbors.

1258
01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:40,087
I can't believe. I can't believe.
I mean, it ain't like you.

1259
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:41,349
I know.

1260
01:32:41,525 --> 01:32:44,290
You've never done anything
like it before in your life.

1261
01:32:44,561 --> 01:32:47,190
I'm dying, you know that?
I'm dying here.

1262
01:32:47,431 --> 01:32:52,096
I blame myself. I notice you been
tense, like something is happening.

1263
01:32:52,369 --> 01:32:55,430
Like that night you're yelling
at the kids like a madman.

1264
01:32:55,706 --> 01:32:57,196
Then you want me to go...

1265
01:32:57,441 --> 01:33:00,172
...on that ride, here
to there, full of those kids.

1266
01:33:00,411 --> 01:33:03,778
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go,
so you yell at me:

1267
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:08,314
"You pig, get on the fucking ride!"
Everything fell out of me.

1268
01:33:08,585 --> 01:33:11,953
My heart, my liver just fell to the floor.
I mean, everything.

1269
01:33:12,222 --> 01:33:16,819
You know what it felt like? You yelling
at me in front of all those people?

1270
01:33:17,094 --> 01:33:19,392
You never talked to me
like that before, Sonny.

1271
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:22,394
I think, "He's gonna shoot me,
dump my body in the river. "

1272
01:33:22,566 --> 01:33:25,126
- Will you just shut up?
- I was scared of you!

1273
01:33:25,502 --> 01:33:29,962
Will you shut the fuck up and
listen to me?! Just listen to me!

1274
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,504
You see that?
With the language and everything.

1275
01:33:32,776 --> 01:33:35,143
I'm trying to talk to you, and you-

1276
01:33:35,412 --> 01:33:37,142
A person can't communicate with you!

1277
01:33:37,414 --> 01:33:41,078
I mean, what am I here?
I'm your wife. I'm your wife!

1278
01:33:42,085 --> 01:33:44,452
You know something?
You hurt me.

1279
01:33:44,721 --> 01:33:48,419
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1280
01:33:49,426 --> 01:33:51,486
Did I ever do anything
to make you do that?

1281
01:33:51,762 --> 01:33:54,595
Did I ever turn you down or anything?

1282
01:33:54,832 --> 01:33:56,629
I know I let myself get fat.

1283
01:33:56,867 --> 01:34:00,098
- Don't call yourself fat.
- You can't stand me to say it.

1284
01:34:00,337 --> 01:34:04,365
Like I can't stand you being
a bank robber. That's what love is.

1285
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:06,942
Yeah? You know what love is, right?

1286
01:34:07,177 --> 01:34:10,613
If you know what love is so much,
why didn't you come down here?

1287
01:34:10,848 --> 01:34:14,841
- Well...
- Talk to me about love, go ahead.

1288
01:34:15,853 --> 01:34:17,320
Sonny, I'm scared.

1289
01:34:17,554 --> 01:34:20,387
I'm scared. Are they
gonna shoot me or something?

1290
01:34:20,657 --> 01:34:22,057
They're not gonna shoot you!

1291
01:34:22,326 --> 01:34:26,262
You should see it on the TV.
They got cannons, machine guns.

1292
01:34:26,497 --> 01:34:28,522
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1293
01:34:28,765 --> 01:34:30,757
It's late already
by the time I find out...

1294
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:34,767
...it's just you and Sal. I can't
get a babysitter! What'll I do?

1295
01:35:06,003 --> 01:35:10,838
Listen, I think I better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1296
01:35:21,251 --> 01:35:23,914
So, what's the matter?
What, he gonna die or what?

1297
01:35:24,087 --> 01:35:29,321
No, no. It's just a precautionary
measure. It's awfully warm in here.

1298
01:35:42,105 --> 01:35:45,041
All right, then. Let's go,
let him out.

1299
01:35:45,275 --> 01:35:47,335
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1300
01:35:48,211 --> 01:35:49,975
I just needed the injection.

1301
01:35:50,247 --> 01:35:54,479
What, you trying to be a hero?
You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1302
01:35:54,751 --> 01:35:56,845
I'm not trying to be anything.

1303
01:35:57,421 --> 01:35:59,389
I just wanna be left alone.

1304
01:35:59,556 --> 01:36:01,115
Okay?

1305
01:36:01,658 --> 01:36:04,787
- No one's bothering you.
- I wish to fuck you never came.

1306
01:36:06,163 --> 01:36:07,494
That's all.

1307
01:36:07,664 --> 01:36:11,066
Don't try to act like
you're some angel of human kindness.

1308
01:36:16,506 --> 01:36:21,308
Out of the closets and into the streets!
Out of the closets and into the streets!

1309
01:36:24,748 --> 01:36:29,276
Out of the closets and into the streets!
Out of the closets and into the streets!

1310
01:36:38,929 --> 01:36:42,422
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1311
01:36:42,599 --> 01:36:45,796
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1312
01:36:45,969 --> 01:36:49,838
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1313
01:37:19,236 --> 01:37:20,829
Ladies.

1314
01:37:22,172 --> 01:37:23,662
Ladies.

1315
01:37:25,075 --> 01:37:28,534
I wanna apologize
for my use of language back there.

1316
01:37:28,945 --> 01:37:31,744
Why? What did you say,
Mr. Mulvaney?

1317
01:37:38,055 --> 01:37:40,546
- What did he say?
- He said the F-word.

1318
01:37:40,824 --> 01:37:42,383
- What?
- What did he say?

1319
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:44,150
He said the F-word.

1320
01:37:51,268 --> 01:37:52,826
- Fuck.
- I know, Miriam.

1321
01:37:53,003 --> 01:37:54,334
Fuck.

1322
01:37:56,973 --> 01:38:00,774
But I'm a Christian
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1323
01:38:03,213 --> 01:38:04,703
Come on.

1324
01:38:04,881 --> 01:38:07,248
Oh, Edna.

1325
01:38:08,351 --> 01:38:11,219
- Then we shouldn't go after them.
- Then we won't.

1326
01:38:11,888 --> 01:38:13,879
- What's that?
- Sonny.

1327
01:38:14,257 --> 01:38:17,557
Could you come out, please?
Sonny?

1328
01:38:17,727 --> 01:38:19,593
- Shit.
- What?

1329
01:38:19,763 --> 01:38:22,596
- It's my mother.
- Sonny.

1330
01:38:23,133 --> 01:38:25,101
Someone here to see you. Sonny...

1331
01:38:25,268 --> 01:38:29,205
- ... could you come out, please?
- Oh, who needs this shit?

1332
01:38:29,372 --> 01:38:33,366
Sonny. Sonny,
could you come out, please?

1333
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:42,783
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1334
01:38:43,954 --> 01:38:47,048
- I don't need you down here.
- Oh, Sonny.

1335
01:38:47,224 --> 01:38:50,523
All of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of television.

1336
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,060
- I got it all worked out, Ma.
- I talked to the man from the FBl.

1337
01:38:54,431 --> 01:38:56,263
Who?
No, don't talk to anybody.

1338
01:38:56,433 --> 01:38:59,835
He says if you come out now,
everything is gonna be all right.

1339
01:39:00,103 --> 01:39:03,130
- I'm trying to get you out of this.
- Don't talk to the FBl.

1340
01:39:03,406 --> 01:39:04,635
I told them everything...

1341
01:39:04,908 --> 01:39:09,778
...how you were in the war in Vietnam,
I told them you always had good jobs.

1342
01:39:09,946 --> 01:39:13,143
I told them you were with Goldwater
in '64 in the convention and-

1343
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:16,318
Listen, I'm getting a plane
and I'm going to Algeria.

1344
01:39:16,586 --> 01:39:18,612
- I'll write you from there.
- Algeria?

1345
01:39:18,789 --> 01:39:21,053
- I gotta get out of here.
- I don't understand.

1346
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:24,317
If I stay and talk to you,
they won't send the limousine.

1347
01:39:24,594 --> 01:39:28,793
- They'll think I'll come out with you.
- What's the matter with that?

1348
01:39:29,065 --> 01:39:30,863
Because I'm not coming with you.

1349
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:35,697
The FBl understands everything,
that it is not you that is doing this.

1350
01:39:35,972 --> 01:39:38,942
It's the pressures from your home life!

1351
01:39:39,176 --> 01:39:42,703
- Don't get on Angie now.
- Did I say one word against her?

1352
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:45,949
You were going to. She has
nothing to do with it, it's me!

1353
01:39:46,183 --> 01:39:49,277
Your life was sweetness and roses.
And you-

1354
01:39:49,452 --> 01:39:53,981
You wouldn't need Leon if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1355
01:39:54,224 --> 01:39:57,819
I don't understand why you
wanna sleep with her anyway.

1356
01:39:58,094 --> 01:40:00,359
You got two kids on welfare now.

1357
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:05,329
- You want three kids on welfare?
- I can't talk to you about this now.

1358
01:40:05,802 --> 01:40:08,135
What are you gonna do?
All right, come out.

1359
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:11,398
I can't come out. I can't.
Sal is in there with the people.

1360
01:40:11,675 --> 01:40:14,405
- If I come out, he's gonna kill them.
- Oh, my God.

1361
01:40:14,611 --> 01:40:16,238
Run. Run.

1362
01:40:16,513 --> 01:40:19,710
Run? Where am I gonna run?
Ma, I can't run.

1363
01:40:19,983 --> 01:40:22,475
- Maybe-
- There's no maybe. No maybes.

1364
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,654
You gotta go home. Where's Pop?
He didn't come, did he?

1365
01:40:25,889 --> 01:40:29,882
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1366
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,153
- He says you're dead.
- He's right.

1367
01:40:32,329 --> 01:40:33,557
- No. No.
- Look, Ma...

1368
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:36,631
...I'm a fuck-up and an outcast
and that's it.

1369
01:40:36,866 --> 01:40:40,234
You come near me, you're
gonna get fucked over and fucked out!

1370
01:40:40,503 --> 01:40:43,405
Now, I gotta go, Ma.
Get her home, okay?

1371
01:40:43,673 --> 01:40:45,141
Just take her home.

1372
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,037
How beautiful you were
when you were a baby.

1373
01:40:48,211 --> 01:40:51,670
Go home now. Get her home now.

1374
01:40:53,183 --> 01:40:54,207
All right.

1375
01:41:01,358 --> 01:41:03,189
Ten minutes.

1376
01:41:18,975 --> 01:41:21,205
Being of sound mind...

1377
01:41:21,811 --> 01:41:23,177
...and body...

1378
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:25,942
You know, what they...

1379
01:41:36,092 --> 01:41:38,425
To my darling wife...

1380
01:41:39,763 --> 01:41:41,128
...Leon...

1381
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:46,769
...whom I love...

1382
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,700
...more than any man...

1383
01:41:53,076 --> 01:41:55,010
...has loved another man...

1384
01:41:56,146 --> 01:41:58,080
...in all eternity.

1385
01:42:02,786 --> 01:42:04,151
I leave...

1386
01:42:05,989 --> 01:42:09,516
...$2700...

1387
01:42:11,494 --> 01:42:15,226
...from my $10,000
life-insurance policy...

1388
01:42:18,802 --> 01:42:20,736
...to be used...

1389
01:42:22,272 --> 01:42:24,934
...for your sex-change operation.

1390
01:42:30,947 --> 01:42:34,042
If there is any money left over...

1391
01:42:37,053 --> 01:42:39,352
...I want it to go to you...

1392
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:43,957
...at my first-

1393
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:48,529
At the first anniversary
of my death...

1394
01:42:49,032 --> 01:42:50,966
...at my grave.

1395
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:01,910
To my wife...

1396
01:43:02,345 --> 01:43:04,279
...to my sweet wife...

1397
01:43:05,415 --> 01:43:07,042
...Angela...

1398
01:43:10,186 --> 01:43:14,316
...$5000 from the same policy.

1399
01:43:19,229 --> 01:43:21,527
You are the only woman...

1400
01:43:21,698 --> 01:43:23,928
...that I ever loved.

1401
01:43:29,205 --> 01:43:32,368
And I repledge my love to you...

1402
01:43:34,444 --> 01:43:36,503
...in this sad moment.

1403
01:43:44,187 --> 01:43:47,213
To little Kimmy...

1404
01:43:48,258 --> 01:43:49,953
...and Timmy.

1405
01:43:51,594 --> 01:43:53,961
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1406
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,733
You are the little man
of the family now...

1407
01:44:08,578 --> 01:44:11,878
...and I hope
you look after them for me.

1408
01:44:16,085 --> 01:44:17,883
To my mother...

1409
01:44:21,491 --> 01:44:23,789
...I ask forgiveness.

1410
01:44:28,465 --> 01:44:31,298
You- You don't understand...

1411
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,934
...the things I said...

1412
01:44:36,973 --> 01:44:38,498
...and did.

1413
01:44:41,611 --> 01:44:45,070
But I'm me and I'm different.

1414
01:44:50,954 --> 01:44:53,650
I want a military funeral...

1415
01:44:58,261 --> 01:45:01,822
...and I'm entitled to have one,
free of charge.

1416
01:45:07,637 --> 01:45:10,698
God- God bless you...

1417
01:45:12,141 --> 01:45:14,110
...and watch over you...

1418
01:45:17,814 --> 01:45:20,681
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1419
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:38,497
Here, I'll sign.
I'll spell that last name.

1420
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:47,007
- Watch out!
- Watch out over here.

1421
01:45:47,176 --> 01:45:49,145
Look out over here. Watch it.

1422
01:45:53,049 --> 01:45:54,983
Come on, sarge, just one picture?

1423
01:46:02,692 --> 01:46:04,683
Back, back!

1424
01:46:07,197 --> 01:46:09,392
All you guys, back up!

1425
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:36,582
- You're the driver?
- Yeah.

1426
01:46:39,028 --> 01:46:41,088
All right. I wanna check it out.

1427
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:47,568
- These seats come out?
- No, they're bolted.

1428
01:46:55,511 --> 01:46:58,208
All right, here.
Light me on that side.

1429
01:46:59,716 --> 01:47:01,513
Give me light over there.

1430
01:47:06,823 --> 01:47:08,313
All right.

1431
01:47:14,163 --> 01:47:16,792
Jesus, you're the man, huh?

1432
01:47:17,667 --> 01:47:20,329
I was watching. I saw you, man.

1433
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:24,563
You should see yourself,
you wouldn't believe it.

1434
01:47:24,941 --> 01:47:28,138
- I believe it.
- Goddamn, Sheila won't believe it.

1435
01:47:28,311 --> 01:47:29,904
- Who's Sheila?
- My old lady.

1436
01:47:30,146 --> 01:47:32,274
They said, "Gas up a stretch...

1437
01:47:32,448 --> 01:47:35,907
- ... go to 285 Prospect Park West. "
- Give me some light over here.

1438
01:47:36,085 --> 01:47:39,612
I said, "Shit, another load
for the massage parlors. "

1439
01:47:56,372 --> 01:47:57,430
It's okay.

1440
01:47:57,874 --> 01:47:59,842
My man, I'm gonna remember you.

1441
01:48:07,183 --> 01:48:09,709
This is Agent Murphy.
He'll be your driver.

1442
01:48:10,086 --> 01:48:11,349
No, I want him.

1443
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:16,682
- Give me the black guy.
- Hey, man, I ain't into that shit.

1444
01:48:16,859 --> 01:48:18,156
Nobody'll hurt you.

1445
01:48:19,228 --> 01:48:22,198
If they would've shot,
they would've shot already.

1446
01:48:22,398 --> 01:48:24,992
- I can't allow that, Sonny.
- You can't allow?

1447
01:48:25,335 --> 01:48:28,702
What makes you think you can
say shit to me? I'm running this.

1448
01:48:30,039 --> 01:48:32,667
I'll pay you. What do you want?
A hundred? Two hundred?

1449
01:48:32,842 --> 01:48:34,503
A thousand? Come on.

1450
01:48:35,745 --> 01:48:37,713
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1451
01:48:39,048 --> 01:48:40,516
Come on.

1452
01:48:42,618 --> 01:48:44,018
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1453
01:48:49,425 --> 01:48:52,554
You men that shoot,
aim for white meat.

1454
01:49:01,003 --> 01:49:02,699
Take a walk.

1455
01:49:04,073 --> 01:49:05,131
Give me him.

1456
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:10,379
You think you're dealing
with a fucking idiot?

1457
01:49:11,381 --> 01:49:12,746
Take a walk, cop!

1458
01:49:17,887 --> 01:49:21,084
Everybody is a con man. Come on.

1459
01:49:25,361 --> 01:49:27,091
I want everyone across the street.

1460
01:49:28,765 --> 01:49:31,165
I want them all back,
on the sidewalk!

1461
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,800
Let's go!

1462
01:49:33,536 --> 01:49:36,096
At least I know
who I'm dealing with now.

1463
01:49:39,075 --> 01:49:41,544
Here's a pen for you. Come on.

1464
01:49:51,721 --> 01:49:53,587
Don't move, okay?

1465
01:49:57,126 --> 01:50:00,187
Sonny, here's your document.

1466
01:50:01,297 --> 01:50:04,756
- Right.
- Oh, you gotta sign it. Here.

1467
01:50:06,569 --> 01:50:09,630
We're taking off. We're going now.

1468
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:12,139
Okay, Sal. Where is he? Sal?

1469
01:50:12,942 --> 01:50:14,273
Sal.

1470
01:50:14,444 --> 01:50:16,139
That's it, we're going.

1471
01:50:16,979 --> 01:50:19,073
Here, people, let's go. We're going.

1472
01:50:19,749 --> 01:50:23,447
- Can I get my sweater?
- Get what you had when you came in.

1473
01:50:33,296 --> 01:50:34,763
Sal?

1474
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:38,497
Sal.

1475
01:50:41,337 --> 01:50:43,465
- How you doing?
- Good.

1476
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:46,507
- Good? We're gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

1477
01:50:47,009 --> 01:50:48,875
We're gonna do it. Sal, see...

1478
01:50:49,145 --> 01:50:51,739
...you gotta keep your eye on him.
He's the driver.

1479
01:50:51,981 --> 01:50:54,279
- I need it.
- No, it's mine.

1480
01:50:54,517 --> 01:50:56,747
You gotta keep
your eye on him, Sal, see?

1481
01:51:01,757 --> 01:51:03,623
All right, where am I now?

1482
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:03,519
All right, hold it. Hold it.

1483
01:52:04,387 --> 01:52:06,116
All right, let's go.

1484
01:52:06,889 --> 01:52:09,620
Swing around now. Swing around.

1485
01:52:10,326 --> 01:52:12,260
Just keep holding hands.

1486
01:52:18,534 --> 01:52:19,899
Hold it.

1487
01:52:21,837 --> 01:52:24,102
Break it on "three. "
Not yet, don't break yet.

1488
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,399
One...

1489
01:52:26,709 --> 01:52:28,268
...two...

1490
01:52:28,444 --> 01:52:30,037
- ... three. Go.
- Go.

1491
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:43,220
Oh, fuck. We did it.

1492
01:52:43,392 --> 01:52:46,123
- We did it.
- Wish us luck.

1493
01:52:47,563 --> 01:52:48,758
Bye-bye.

1494
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,933
- Okay, you got your one.
- Follow my car.

1495
01:53:07,016 --> 01:53:08,484
Sheldon here, get me Kennedy.

1496
01:53:08,651 --> 01:53:12,918
- Sal, we did it.
- Yeah.

1497
01:53:13,322 --> 01:53:15,655
I'll be a son of a bitch, we did it.

1498
01:53:16,292 --> 01:53:19,284
Okay, let's move.
Come on, honk the horn.

1499
01:53:21,897 --> 01:53:24,162
Hey, Sal, do me a favor, will you?

1500
01:53:24,433 --> 01:53:27,403
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, the gun'll go off.

1501
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:39,648
All right. You set out there?

1502
01:53:42,485 --> 01:53:44,282
We're leaving now.

1503
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,420
We want no trouble en route.

1504
01:53:49,425 --> 01:53:50,688
- Intersection check?
- Check.

1505
01:53:53,429 --> 01:53:56,922
- All right. We'll be starting up right now.
- 10-4.

1506
01:54:28,864 --> 01:54:30,230
It's gonna be all right.

1507
01:54:56,092 --> 01:54:57,582
Sal.

1508
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,923
Sal, you just gotta remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1509
01:55:24,553 --> 01:55:25,953
You fucking-

1510
01:55:30,259 --> 01:55:32,250
Hey, let him go!

1511
01:57:27,843 --> 01:57:29,038
What's he doing?

1512
01:57:29,411 --> 01:57:31,778
He's still got some
arrangements to make.

1513
01:57:45,294 --> 01:57:47,695
- That's it?
- That's it.

1514
01:57:47,863 --> 01:57:50,662
Sal, see it? There it is.

1515
01:58:47,489 --> 01:58:49,116
Oh, I forgot.

1516
01:58:49,358 --> 01:58:51,486
I forgot to ask if they
got food on board.

1517
01:58:56,332 --> 01:58:57,822
They gonna have food on board?

1518
01:59:04,373 --> 01:59:07,604
There's your jet. We get one more now.
That's the deal.

1519
01:59:07,843 --> 01:59:10,107
Right. Okay, who goes?

1520
01:59:10,646 --> 01:59:12,114
Sylvia?

1521
01:59:13,649 --> 01:59:15,242
Maria.

1522
01:59:23,258 --> 01:59:25,454
I'll pray for you.

1523
01:59:26,295 --> 01:59:27,626
Sal...

1524
01:59:28,063 --> 01:59:30,225
...because this is
your first plane trip...

1525
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:32,891
...don't be scared, okay?

1526
01:59:46,515 --> 01:59:49,644
I didn't eat all day.
Will there be any food on board?

1527
01:59:49,985 --> 01:59:51,544
There'll be hamburgers. Ready?

1528
01:59:55,157 --> 01:59:56,989
- Sal.
- What?

1529
01:59:57,393 --> 01:59:59,054
Ready to go?

1530
01:59:59,661 --> 02:00:00,993
Yeah.

1531
02:00:05,234 --> 02:00:08,294
Okay. Let's move it.

1532
02:00:10,005 --> 02:00:11,405
Sal...

1533
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:15,367
...we don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1534
02:00:15,744 --> 02:00:17,405
You keep your gun pointed up.

1535
02:00:19,748 --> 02:00:21,409
You ready to get out first?

1536
02:00:21,884 --> 02:00:23,249
I'm ready.

1537
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,881
Don't shoot me.

1538
02:00:31,393 --> 02:00:34,021
Wait, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it, please.

1539
02:00:34,196 --> 02:00:35,686
Okay, it's safe. Come on.

1540
02:00:35,864 --> 02:00:37,696
Put him away, put him away.

1541
02:00:52,047 --> 02:00:55,415
All right, guys, move back.
Come on, back up.

1542
02:01:08,163 --> 02:01:09,631
Now spread them!

1543
02:01:14,503 --> 02:01:17,268
No. No, we're all secure here.

1544
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:20,170
Murphy will report from the car.

1545
02:01:24,813 --> 02:01:26,474
You make the report.

1546
02:01:26,748 --> 02:01:28,148
Put the gun down.

1547
02:01:28,417 --> 02:01:29,748
Back off.

1548
02:01:30,586 --> 02:01:34,522
Get up now, Sonny.
You're under arrest.

1549
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:36,920
You have the right to remain silent.

1550
02:01:37,092 --> 02:01:40,790
You have the right to an attorney
during your interrogation.

1551
02:01:41,029 --> 02:01:45,262
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1552
02:01:45,434 --> 02:01:47,527
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer...

1553
02:01:47,703 --> 02:01:51,833
...one will be appointed
to represent you if you wish one.

1554
02:02:04,553 --> 02:02:08,148
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1555
02:02:08,323 --> 02:02:11,919
...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?

1556
02:02:12,161 --> 02:02:13,185
Repeat:

1557
02:02:13,428 --> 02:02:16,694
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1558
02:02:17,132 --> 02:02:21,365
...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?

1559
02:02:21,637 --> 02:02:23,969
Yeah, I got you.
We'll hold here.
