00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:27,242
HI, how are you?

185
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:28,202
Nervous.

186
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:32,044
Lets begin with something
simple say… Tchaicovsky.

187
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:41,531
Earthquakes, eh. Let us see by
this does not fall to pieces.

188
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,068
Oh... Pretty!

189
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:09,869
Not BAD!

190
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,352
Comming up on the Chello part.

191
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:14,873
And lets just listen to our
newest member...

192
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:17,115
Madeline Robistat.

193
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:18,115

194
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,800

195
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,325

196
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,130

00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:52,858

"Chellie"

205
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,164
I thought that you would like
to meet a friend...

206
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,966
... or at least my bosses
computer

207
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,571

allright!

209
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:54,298

211
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,421

212
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:13,872
Hello, Cinderella?

213
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,594

00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:23,198
What are some fairy

217
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:26,200
Frog Prince, the 3 bears...

218
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,763

Jack and the bean stalk...?

219
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:32,444

00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,767

221
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,768

226
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,069
Water.

227
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,006

228
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,447

229
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,260

246
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:56,578
I think most of them are
allready there.

247
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:59,340
Oh, I wanted to tell you
how much I enjoy your music.

248
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,701

00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:04,583

00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:05,584
Ginger snap?

252
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:06,824
So pretty...

253
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,147
At first I thought it was
the televisión...

254
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:10,917
From MY apartment?

255
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:12,668

256
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:13,629

259
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:22,395
So you are a
musician.

260
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:23,756
No, I am artech...

261
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,198
That is what I heard.
like your music...

262
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,022
I think that is the cash
register!

263
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,882
Really,
so what are you doing...

264
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:35,723
... for dinner MR
Archieologist!

265
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:37,605
Architect.

266
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:41,007
So it made you decide
to be a musician?

267
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,128
My mother.

268
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:44,730
She used to play a lot
of music in the house.

269
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,492
Bach, Beethoven, Bing Crosby.

270
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,053
and you studied Chelo.

271
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:51,214
No, I danced alone
in my room...

272
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,294
In front of the mirror.

273
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,656
I wanted to be a great
ballarenia.

274
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:57,218
But my mother said I was
too short!

275
00:20:57,618 --> 00:21:00,180
So she gave me chello
lessons instead!

276
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,261
So, what about you?

277
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,743
, architecture…

278
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:06,184
, is not very
exighting right now...

279
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,585
Mainly sinks and
bathtubs..

280
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,267
The plubming in
high rise buildings...

281
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,588
That what you do your
first few years

282
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:15,070
I have a special
project on the side.

283
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,311
Some new building?

284
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,831
Is a new brick.

285
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,235
It has fascets like a diamond.

286
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:25,236
Or more like a jigsaw
puzzle piece.

287
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,237
But why?

288
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,599
Well, then it wont
come apart in an earthquake.

289
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:30,520
And, you built this?

290
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,002
No, but I will
Someday.

291
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,923

294
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,209
Oh... thats...
I told you thats......nothing.

295
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,930
What are you talking about!
That was... Brilliant!

296
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:46,975
It was?

297
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,012
Extraordinary
Like we were talking...

298
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,733
... Communicating!

299
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:52,414
Where did you study?

300
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,936

301
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,177

302
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:58,739
No, architecture.

303
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,861
Ok I'm Sorry

304
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,661
For What?

305
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,223
for Intruding

306
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:08,985
I understand, used to dance single
in my room, you remember?

307
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,907
Thats why I wanted
to meet you

308
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,948
I thought you wanted me
to hear

309
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,070
But I didnt do it

310
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:21,914
Well, Maybe I did,
just a little

311
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:26,317
- Will I see you again?
I think so, we are neighbors!

312
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:27,958
No i mean OUT!

313
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:29,799
OK, where?

314
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,799
How about tomorrow night

315
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,681
I rehearse every night this

316
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,722
... except Wednesdays.

317
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,722
Oh, Wednesday?

318
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:36,763

319

324
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:52,334

326
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:54,616

327
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:59,539
Oh but miles, even though

00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:00,860
Well, I still loved it

329
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,421
And its ok if you do it

330
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,183
- Good night.
Good night.

331
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:12,467
She said she heard music..

332
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,951
Perhaps the mixer.

333
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:22,914
Couldnt be that

334
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:30,879
Not the TV

335
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,123
Well at least that works

336
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,846

339
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:51,493
There is no dog in here

340
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,328
MILES

341
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,135

00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:11,185
Oh, you were in the shower?

345
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:12,667
No why?

346
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:15,468
I heard singing

347
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:16,780
Is the radio.

348
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,030
Oh, Classical?

349
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,751
Oh, All the time...

352
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:23,394

00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:56,055
Oh, is not nothing.
Its the echo in this building

366
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:57,096
It must be the echo!

367
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:58,737
If you say so...
... you are the expert

368
00:26:58,767 --> 00:26:59,657

Miles it was so funny!
But while I was playing...

401
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:47,538
... I thought I heard... like that
day in our building!

402
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:48,504
Yes. I heard it too!

403
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,691
It must have been some nut with
a radio... it was... terrable!

410
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,107
She's exaggerating.

411
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:10,143
Well, I would really like to

412
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:15,216

00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,593
I cancelled It.

430
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:58,745
Im not doing anything... well I had
plans but...

431
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,996

Good bye.

00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:42,104
Open up!

440
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:46,476
Open up God Damnit! or I will
break the door down!

441
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:49,128
SHIT!

442
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:52,300
Stupid piece of junk!

443
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:53,301
What do you think...

444
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:54,902
What kind of!

445
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,285
Im talking to a machine!

446
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:02,397
What is happening to me?

447
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,079
Im going nuts!

448
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,582
This has gone too far!

449
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,197
I am going to have you
checked out tomorrow

450
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,434
What ever is doing this to you is
going to be removed

451
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:31,642
I am doing It again…

452
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:33,598
I cannot believe this.

453
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,881
Whatever you do, keep
your mouth SHUT

454
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:49,938
She is with me, Bill.

455
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,192
No, no.

456
00:34:56,773 --> 00:35:00,055
She is with me.

457
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,809
I cannot touch.

458
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:14,945
Come back here

459
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:18,837
She is…

460
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,220
Come...

461
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:31,827

462
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,811

468
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:04,418
I did.

469
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,022
Who is in this room?

470
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:11,022

471
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,495

472
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,488
Oh, God mine!

473
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,600
Hello.

474
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,242
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

475
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:42,272

476
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:43,774
you are talking!

477
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,258
Don't Touch

478
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,251
But you CANT
Talk!

479
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:56,252
NO!

480
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,855
Its not in the instruction
Book!

481
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,116
Nothing you did was

482
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,999
But you do not have brain.

483
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:09,335
What is AN BRAIN?

484
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,123
Memory cells that
can think

485
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:16,876
I Am… I am…
What am I?

486
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:21,609
Um, Memory cells that...

487
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,621
... Process...

488
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:28,143
Must have been the Memory
dump from...

489
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,334
... the computer
at the office

490
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:32,306
How you know so many words?

491
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:33,307
Word processing.

492
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,488
Or maybe the champagne.

493
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:37,489
Maybe...

494
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:45,414
So...
So!

495
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:57,362
I dont believe this!

496
00:37:57,397 --> 00:37:58,363
Where is she?

497
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:01,445
- Who?
She... The music...

498
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:03,716
Madeline, she is...
...upstairs

499
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:07,159
How you know that she is woman?

500
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,920
The sounds when she moves...

501
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,487
what, her footsteps

502
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,313
They are different from you

503
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:17,436
Do you hear her?

504
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:18,401
Do you talk her?

505
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:20,482
Do you talk her?

506
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,075
TO her... yes!

507
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,631
Do you see her?

508
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:26,631
Often.

509
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:28,418
Are you sure this thing...?

510
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:29,514
Dont touch!

511
00:38:32,415 --> 00:38:33,517
What now?

512
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:35,788
What now?

513
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:44,144
Have you had this car long?

514
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:45,824
No its my 3rd!

515
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:49,797
They break down a lot...

516
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,468
Can I turn this down

517
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,109
No its broken

518
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,162
Madeline, have you ever heard
of artificial intelligence?

519
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,793
What you mean?

520
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:02,816
Like computers that speak.

521
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,337
Yes. My mother has one.

522
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:06,303
Yes?

523
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:07,339
Its a clock that
tells you the time...

524
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:11,832
Oh, thats not like "think"
talking!

525
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:14,223
Since when is "thinking"
"talking"?

526
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:19,186
What about a machine
that can create art?

527
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:22,949
Write poetry, or create music?

528
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:24,580
What about those things?

529
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,702
Whats wrong with artists
doing those things?

530
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,786
I know that love hurts

531
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:37,608
If you know what I went through

532
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:40,531
If you knew how much I loved you!

533
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:44,023
And how much I still do!

534
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,861
So who is this Bill!

535
00:39:58,222 --> 00:40:00,644
So who is this in the car?

536
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:04,806
You know, I havent put
popcorn on my dash in years!

537
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,273
When you said movie...

538
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:08,849
I like comming here, the sound is
good...and...its very private...

539
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:09,920
oh...

540
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,343
I must move this thing. its stuck!
- OH~!

541
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:16,789
Did I get any on
you?

542
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:19,716
Thats ok Diet coke does
not stain?

543
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,609
Its not diet, and they
only had Root Beer!

544
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:28,943
Do you want some
popcorn?

545
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,656
You got JU JU BEES
in my popcorn!

546
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:34,847
Any red ones?

547
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:35,847
uh...no.

548
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,690
Its really hard to see red in
the dark!

549
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:40,655
Madeline, I am sure that…

550
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,581
... we can get another box!

551
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:45,124
No, we CANT, I
brought them from home!

552
00:40:45,504 --> 00:40:47,084
Argh! I was just
Stretching!

553
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,516
You are OK?

554
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:54,989
Just stretching, right!

Kiss on my lips...
Tears on my pillows...

586
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:38,128
Doesnt matter, they
should rhyme!

587
00:42:38,163 --> 00:42:38,938

593
00:42:52,518 --> 00:42:54,884
Alcataraz, what are we doing going
to a prison?

594
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:59,072
EX Prison, its now
A Tourist place!

595
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,123
Where Begin

596
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,476
1st rythm.

597
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:13,146
There is so smoking... eating...blah
on this tour...

598
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:16,013
If you want to do those things...
do them in the dock area!

599
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:18,845
Also, if you have a heart condition, or
other problems...

600
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:20,586
you dont want to be on this
tour!

601
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:21,862
All right, lets move it along!

602
00:43:21,897 --> 00:43:23,598
Walk together quickly!

603
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:26,105
Bring up the rear there!

604
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,290
Stop right here!

605
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,266
Come on!

606
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:33,034
inmates never entered the building this way...
only the warden did!

607
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:56,179
Let me out!
I didnt do it!

608
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:57,181
melody...

609
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:03,955
too slow

610
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:07,447
Too Simple

611
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:12,660
Too long!

612
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:18,404
YES!
Now backwards!

613
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,490
What are you doing?
Stop!

614
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:47,264
Hello?

615
00:44:48,134 --> 00:44:49,134
What?

616
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:52,927
this is where the inmates went
when they were being punished!

617
00:44:53,978 --> 00:44:56,469
This place is good and dirty!

618
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:19,010
Four brothers
no short stuff!

619
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:20,375
Nice toy!

620
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,061
Have you known a
lot of giris?

621
00:46:00,096 --> 00:46:01,062
A few.

622
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,014
But none ever won
me a penguin!

623
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,196
How about you?
- Penguins?

624
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:08,307
No, MEN!

625
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:10,428
Enough!

626
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,452
But none ever wrote music for me!

627
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:34,854
I never had a day like this
EVER!

628
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:38,517
Its my pleasure.
Now for MY pleasure!

629
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,520
Kiss me Groucho!

630
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:48,143
- Youre beeping!
Its just my watch!

631
00:46:50,214 --> 00:46:52,456
- Oh you will be late for rehersal!
SO!

632
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:54,628
I will be late then!

633
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:22,656
If you can play it for her, you
can play it for me!

634
00:47:22,691 --> 00:47:23,621
What?

635
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:24,657

636
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:26,544
What key?

637
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:27,709
Your favorite

638
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,163
Do you want verses first?
Or choruses?

639
00:47:32,203 --> 00:47:32,973
Any way you like!

640
00:47:33,008 --> 00:47:33,973
YES!

641
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:38,266

642
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:42,880
Five, four, three and Lift!

00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:53,427
Stop STOP!

646
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,192
Wrong?

647
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:56,268
Sounds like Soda Pop!

648
00:47:56,303 --> 00:47:57,234
It IS!

649
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:58,235
And those WORDS!

650
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,235

I want to squeeze you, lick you..

But they rhyme!

654
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:09,192
NO, We must do it again!

655
00:48:09,227 --> 00:48:11,633
Do over?

656
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:14,275
Its gotta be slow...

657
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,862
I dont know what love is...

658
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:17,862
And the words...
you have gotta understand them!

660
00:48:19,883 --> 00:48:22,155

Kiss..

Like that?

666
00:48:40,277 --> 00:48:42,089
Well actually...
2 mouths!

667
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:44,640
Two mouths.

668
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,483
And then you pucker up, touch lips,
and kiss!

669
00:48:48,883 --> 00:48:49,884
Next...

670
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,884
Did you...

671
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:52,185
Kiss to her?

672
00:48:52,485 --> 00:48:54,127
YES.

673
00:48:54,162 --> 00:48:55,733
Next...

674
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:56,768
You spelled it wrong!

675
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,370
The real way is
L O V E

676
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,602
It is the most powerful feeling
in the universe!

677
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:04,289
Really!

678
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:06,125
Its how we have all survived!

679
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,730
How does it feel like?

680
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:10,137
It can make you feel happy,
Sad...

681
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:12,078
Nervous, calm...

682
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:14,029
Hot,...Cold...

683
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:17,512
...Can give you stregnth,
Make you weak...

684
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:20,213
Moles...
That does not compute!

685
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:22,645
Look!
I cant!

686
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,611
Listen...

687
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:25,092
Its not about words...

688
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:26,538
its about feelings...

689
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:29,130
Remember when you first played
the music for her...

690
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,430
YES!

691
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,838
Try to remember what it was
like...

692
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:37,235
it came from deep inside me!

693
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,752
she made me feel...

694
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:41,457
Thats it! She made
you feel!

695
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:43,129
Good! Perfect!

696
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:45,147
Love!

697
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,086
Well, no...

698
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,063
But its good enough
for a song!

699
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:50,414
Any other words?

700
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:51,414
Screw

701
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:54,277
Where did you hear that?

702
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:56,157
The cleaning lady.

703
00:49:56,192 --> 00:49:57,548
She said that?

704
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:01,651
Could have been the plumber...
...he was here too!

705
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:03,152
Well skip that word...

706
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:04,984
Next?...

707
00:50:13,689 --> 00:50:16,266
Attn: sports fans...

708
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:19,803
We interrupt this program for
a brief musical interlude...

709
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,503
I finished it... Moles.

710
00:50:26,538 --> 00:50:28,529
Ok, lets hear it!

711
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:15,399
Is beautiful.
But I cannot give it to her...

712
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:16,399
- Why not?

713
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:20,032
Madeline!
What you are doing here?

714
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:22,094
I thought you were at
rehersal.

715
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:24,595
I forgot my music...

716
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,866
and now I find this

717
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:30,019
Its wonderful Miles

718
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:32,875
You wrote it for me

719
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,742
No... I mean...

720
00:53:34,942 --> 00:53:36,783
Did you like it?

721
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:40,016
You keep saying you know
nothing about music...

722
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:41,576
...then you surprise me with this...

723
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,199
I LIKED it!

724
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:54,585
Are you sure you dont
have a dog?

725
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,181
No, just a PEST!

726
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:58,287
Come on, Ill walk you
to your car!

727
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:05,812

From now on,
Stay OUT of this ROOM!

731
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:29,288
I want to TELL her!

732
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,602

00:54:35,162 --> 00:54:37,113
Whats been going on!

734
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:39,195
Who wrote the song.

735
00:54:39,335 --> 00:54:42,897
Get out of there, go to your...
... um... room..?!

736
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:46,159

Please!

739
00:54:56,716 --> 00:54:58,497
Maybe she loves ME!

740
00:55:05,031 --> 00:55:07,128
How could she possibly
do that?

741
00:55:07,163 --> 00:55:10,375
She loves Music, MY MUSIC...
...MY song!

742
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:11,415
Your Song?

743
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:13,462
It was MY Idea?

I want to Kiss her!

745
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:20,377

Whats a dream?

755
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:47,930
A dream is a wish your
heart makes...

756
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:49,741
When you are fast asleep.

1092
01:20:16,992 --> 01:20:19,573
Its about a feeling....

1093
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:23,416
Miles, for the first time in my life, I feel
like I am not alone.

1094
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:26,647
Like you are not just someone living
under me....

1095
01:20:26,682 --> 01:20:27,879
....or beside me....

1096
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:33,102
Even when you wern't there, its like
you were!

1097
01:20:35,824 --> 01:20:37,464
... And I was all right!

1098
01:20:39,146 --> 01:20:42,548
Miles... I guess...
I love you.

1099
01:21:09,726 --> 01:21:11,046
[beeping]

1100
01:21:24,556 --> 01:21:25,266
Hello.

1101
01:21:26,307 --> 01:21:27,497
[computer]
Hello :(

1102
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:30,090
[computer]
Good bye :(

1103
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,451
Good bye?

1104
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:33,832
[computer]
I'm Leaving

1105
01:21:33,872 --> 01:21:35,143
Why?

1106
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:39,446
[computer]
Because I finally found out
what love is.

1107
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:42,468
What Is it?

1108
01:21:42,508 --> 01:21:46,791
[computer]
Its give and not take

1109
01:21:46,821 --> 01:21:51,074
[computer]
So I give her to you,
and I take myself away....

1110
01:21:53,515 --> 01:21:54,996
So why would you do that?

1111
01:21:55,036 --> 01:21:57,838
[computer]
Because thats what love is

1112
01:21:58,878 --> 01:22:03,722
[computer]
Besides its a game for just
two people.

1113
01:22:05,493 --> 01:22:06,629
[computer]
Youre different now

1114
01:22:06,664 --> 01:22:09,155
[computer]
You were ready to turn me off....

1115
01:22:09,606 --> 01:22:13,338
[computer]
2 hours, 28 minutes and 52 seconds ago

1116
01:22:13,368 --> 01:22:14,489
I couldnt do that now

1117
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:17,020
[computer]
You couldnt if you wanted to

1118
01:22:18,162 --> 01:22:20,063
[computer]
I even had to fool myself.

1119
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:24,776
[computer]
Im not really capable of self destruct.

1120
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,257
What did you do?

1121
01:22:26,297 --> 01:22:27,632
[computer]
I called long distance....

1122
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:32,961
[computer]
I sent 40,000 volts
around the world.

1123
01:22:34,703 --> 01:22:37,464
[computer]
It should be in Tokyo
by now....

1124
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,865

1125
01:22:38,905 --> 01:22:42,237
[computer]
Dont be upset... I dialed
toll free!

1126
01:22:44,088 --> 01:22:46,550
Wheat happens when It gets here?

1127
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:49,312
[computer]
Just dont pick up on the
1st ring.

1128
01:22:51,554 --> 01:22:56,437
[computer softly]
could you hold.... meeee?

1129
01:22:58,238 --> 01:22:59,518

[computer]
Thank you!

1133
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:18,932
[computer]
Relax, its a local call!

1134
01:23:20,783 --> 01:23:21,823
[computer]
Just a minute...

1135
01:23:22,253 --> 01:23:25,656
[computer]
Would you like to own a
free encyclopedia

1136
01:23:25,686 --> 01:23:28,337
No, just hang up

1137
01:23:28,377 --> 01:23:31,180
[computer]
No thanks, we dont need any!

1138
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:38,504
[computer]
I think this might be it.....
you better put me down....

1139
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:48,791
[computer]
Thank you!

1140
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:58,198
I feel like a part of me is dying

1141
01:23:58,228 --> 01:24:00,759
Youll get over it!

1142
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:08,244
[computer]
You never asked me my name!

1143
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:11,146
What is it?

1144
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:13,048

1145
01:24:13,088 --> 01:24:14,889

1147
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:22,333

1154
01:25:04,992 --> 01:25:06,522
Where is your brick?

1155
01:25:06,552 --> 01:25:08,164
Still in my head.

1156
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:11,165
Two weeks without telephone and TV.

1157
01:25:11,196 --> 01:25:14,038
Or movies,
we can only look at each other.

1158
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:31,019
Is yours broken too?
-I dont think so.

1159
01:25:31,299 --> 01:25:32,750
