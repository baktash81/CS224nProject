1
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,273
I think this house
will be exactly right for you.

2
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,031
That's what she said about all the wrong
ones she showed us yesterday!

3
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,668
Isn't it rather isolated?

4
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,792
Well, secluded, I'd say.

5
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,195
- Are you sure it wasn't $1,000 a week?
- Quite sure.

6
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,675
- Furnished?
- Indeed.

7
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,792
- What's the catch?
- Catch, Mr Curtis?

8
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,037
A bargain like that
wouldn't stay on the market.

9
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,515
Maybe there's a ghost.

10
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,555
What self-respecting English house
would be without one?

11
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,392
Nonsense. The fact is Mrs Aylwood,
the owner, is a bit eccentric.

12
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,717
She has no family left
and she needs the income,

13
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,075
but she is quite sentimental about the house
and picky about who lives in it.

14
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,317
Look around.
I'll nip to the cottage for the keys.

15
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,114
- Is someone living there?
- Mrs Aylwood.

16
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,077
I expect that's why she wants to make sure
the tenants are the right sort of people.

17
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,276
If we live here, I'm gonna climb this
and go exploring in those woods.

18
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,600
Leave a trail of pebbles so I can grab you
before the wicked witch eats you up.

19
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,191
If she lives in a gingerbread house,
I'll eat it up. I'm starved!

20
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,231
- What is it?
- Mrs Aylwood.

21
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,070
- I've brought a lovely family to...
- You were told to notify me first.

22
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,115
- I tried to reach you by telephone.
- I haven't left the house all day.

23
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,352
Mrs Curtis writes charming children's books,

24
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,712
and Mrs Curtis is quite well-known
in American musical circles.

25
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,278
Pianist and composer. He's here
to conduct one of his own operas.

26
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,119
Mrs Aylwood, are you all right?

27
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,595
I'll get the keys.

28
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,509
They don't build houses like this any more.

29
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,075
What we need is a little light.

30
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,392
There's a large dining room
and the kitchen has full butler's pantry.

31
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,991
The living room is just beyond
the music room. This way.

32
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,348
That's a bit more cheery, isn't it?

33
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
How long before lunch?

34
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,272
You just had breakfast an hour ago.

35
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,152
When you said opera,
I thought he was a serious musician.

36
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,831
I have a very soft touch late at night.

37
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,674
Come on, Jan. Let's go upstairs.

38
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,634
I want that room. It's really neat,
and you can look right out at the woods.

39
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,239
Did you hurt yourself?

40
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,836
It's just a little cut.

41
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,394
I thought...

42
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,956
I thought I saw something
out there in the woods.

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,275
What sort of person are you?

44
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,198
It's hard to say. Just... average, I guess.

45
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,552
Are you adventurous... and kind?

46
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,228
Are you kind?

47
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,715
I... try to be.

48
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,876
And sensitive?

49
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,155
Do you sense things?

50
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,590
Mrs Aylwood, my husband would like
to talk about the details of the lease.

51
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,951
That is, if you've decided to let us live here.

52
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,438
I'm going to take a chance on you.

53
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,671
Isn't this a pretty room?

54
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,598
- What was all that about?
- I don't know.

55
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,075
What happened to your hand?

56
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,475
I cut it on that window.

57
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,636
Let's see.

58
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,993
- Mom?
- What, darling?

59
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,398
- Couldn't we keep looking?
- This place has everything we need.

60
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,038
- And the price is right. Why don't you like it?
- I don't know.

61
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,832
The whole atmosphere, I guess.

62
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,474
I had such a funny, cold feeling
out by the woods.

63
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,234
Like someone was watching me.

64
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,593
And then there's Mrs Aylwood...
and this house.

65
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,157
Older people, when they live alone,
tend to be a bit unusual.

66
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,630
Something awful happened here.

67
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,796
I can feel it.

68
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,836
Something awful.

69
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,798
Boy, Mrs Aylwood sure is creepy.

70
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,717
Comforting to know
we're the right sort of people.

71
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,515
I've seen the iciest of old ladies
melted by your charm.

72
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,837
- I think your daughter did the trick.
- Me?

73
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,996
No, dear, not you.

74
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,393
She had a daughter, about your age.

75
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,751
- Had?
- Lost, many years ago.

76
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,198
- Perhaps you reminded Mrs Aylwood of her.
- Lost how?

77
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,235
I really don't know all the details,
just that she disappeared.

78
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,591
I believe the circumstances
were rather tragic.

79
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,030
She's going to stay here.

80
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,110
Is that what you wanted?

81
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,155
Let's see. Gooseneck lamp
up here with the rest of my writing things,

82
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,635
mirror in the living room, please.

83
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,395
- Jan, you didn't!
- I don't know what happened.

84
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,750
I wasn't even touching it!

85
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,516
Mom, I couldn't see myself in it.
My reflection wasn't in it.

86
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,994
What?

87
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,556
I couldn't see myself in the mirror.

88
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,274
And then I saw...

89
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,508
I thought I saw... somebody else in it.

90
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,273
You know how old mirrors are. I never made
a move without something getting broken.

91
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,596
That's seven years' bad luck.

92
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,315
Nonsense. I broke a mirror
the day I met your mother.

93
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,398
I'm not sure that makes your point, darling.

94
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,558
It's OK, Dad, I'll get it.

95
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,716
Well, be careful.

96
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,113
Boo!

97
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,073
- Boy, are you ever jumpy!
- Brat!

98
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,996
Look out! You'll wreck the scariest mask
I ever had! I may want to use it on you again.

99
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,317
- Out!
- Some people are no fun at all.

100
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,957
What is going on?
You are supposed to be in bed.

101
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,676
- I was just attacked by that thing.
- Even monsters have to sleep.

102
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,836
Here. Give us a kiss.

103
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,236
- Goodnight.
- 'Night.

104
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,516
Goodnight.

105
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,476
- Sweet dreams.
- You, too.

106
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,476
Mom, will you catch the light?
I'm through reading.

107
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,198
Door.

108
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,956
Must open door.

109
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,518
Door.

110
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,996
Must open door.

111
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,838
Ellie? Ellie, wake up. It's OK.

112
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,077
Ellie, wake up. You were dreaming.

113
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,794
Talking in your sleep. It's OK.

114
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,354
- I wasn't talking. You were.
- No, I wasn't.

115
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,038
Well, you're the only one here.
Who else could it have been?

116
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,553
Jan, can I come into bed with you?

117
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,709
Sure. Then if we talk in our sleep,
we won't wake each other up. Make sense?

118
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,559
No, but I'm coming anyways.

119
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,630
I'll bring Arthur. He'll watch out for us.
Elephants hardly ever sleep, you know.

120
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,150
Mike, you were right.

121
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,909
This one chose me,
so I'd better not hurt its feelings.

122
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,272
It came right away from the mother.
That means she's brave, huh?

123
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,598
- What are you gonna call her?
- I'm not sure. I've gotta think.

124
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,156
She's special,
so it's gotta be a special name.

125
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,234
What's that?

126
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,670
The name of the puppy: Nerak!

127
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,471
- But what does it mean?
- You oughta know. You whispered it to me.

128
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,514
- I was talking to Mike.
- Well, I heard somebody say it.

129
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,474
I've never seen you write like that.

130
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,558
Ring up and Mike will deliver what you need.

131
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,437
That's marvellous. When I'm working, it's
hard to tear myself away from the typewriter.

132
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,236
He can pick things up for you in the village.
He's a good lad, my Mike.

133
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,560
My strong right arm since his dad died.
I wanted him to stay at college, but...

134
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,159
Mrs Fleming? What's wrong?

135
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,832
Nothing. I... I just remembered
I left something cooking. Excuse me.

136
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,436
Look, Mom! Isn't she beautiful?
Her name's Nerak.

137
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,356
We've never known a Karen.

138
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,156
Look, this may not be any of my business.
You want to talk about it?

139
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,555
Jan, we're ready to go now.

140
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,196
I can't. Not now, anyway.

141
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,356
Karen!

142
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,755
Come on, Nerak! Come on.

143
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,710
Come here, Nerak. Come on!

144
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,876
Come on.

145
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,716
Come on, Nerak! Come on.

146
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,876
Come on, come on!

147
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,436
Come on. Come on.

148
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,596
No!

149
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,438
Come on, come on. Come here, Nerak.

150
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,876
- Bye!
- Bye!

151
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,719
Ellie?

152
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,592
Ellie?

153
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,392
Ellie?

154
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,793
Ellie?

155
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,550
Ellie, can you hear me?

156
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,278
Ellie!

157
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,748
Ellie, please!

158
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,557
Ellie, why didn't you answer
when I called you?

159
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,356
I didn't hear you. And you shouldn't
sneak up like that. You scared me.

160
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,552
- I was yelling myself hoarse!
- I didn't hear.

161
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,151
- I asked you not to come into the woods!
- I had to. Nerak ran off.

162
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,875
If I hadn't come after her,
she would have gotten lost.

163
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,913
Isn't this a pretty place?

164
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,994
Yeah.

165
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,110
Yes, it is.

166
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,828
- That's a happy song.
- What?

167
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,076
The song you were just humming.

168
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,676
I wasn't humming anything.

169
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,476
Come here, Nerak.

170
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,751
- Did you see that?
- See what?

171
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,714
All I can see is this vicious animal
trying to smother me!

172
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,557
- We should head back.
- Tell that to Nerak.

173
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,877
- I mean it! Now!
- Come back, you little...

174
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,954
Jan!

175
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,990
- No!
- Let go of me!

176
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,158
- Stop! You're drowning her!
- Let me go!

177
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,748
- Stop!
- Get out of my way!

178
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,597
She had to. She had to push you down
to get you loose from the branch.

179
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,756
She saved your life.

180
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,996
- I thought she was trying to drown you.
- Ellie...

181
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,715
Go and fetch some dry clothes
for your sister.

182
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,680
Yes, ma'am. Come on, Nerak.

183
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,876
Dry your hair or you'll take a chill.

184
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,156
I don't know how to thank you for saving me.

185
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,956
What kind of name is that? Nerak?

186
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,314
Ellie just made that up.
It's the name Karen spelled backwards.

187
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,998
What is it? What's wrong?

188
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,115
That was my daughter's name. Karen.

189
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,317
Mrs Thayer told us
you'd lost your daughter. I'm sorry.

190
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,076
Drink this.

191
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,471
- Mrs Aylwood?
- Yes?

192
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,911
Was anything wrong with Karen's eyes?

193
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,156
Why do you ask?

194
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,354
The night she disappeared...
was she blindfolded?

195
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,877
How do you know about the blindfold?

196
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,595
You asked me once if I sensed things.

197
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,078
Well, I have. And Ellie's been hearing things.

198
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,556
It's like someone is watching us.

199
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,753
- And the day we moved in, I saw something.
- What?

200
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,549
An image in a mirror.

201
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,996
A girl... about my age...
with long blonde hair.

202
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,795
And she was blindfolded.

203
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,110
- You saw her?
- I'm not sure.

204
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,190
Could you...
Could you tell me what happened?

205
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,276
How she disappeared?

206
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,753
My husband was killed in the war.

207
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,198
And Karen was everything to me.

208
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,154
She was soon to be 17,

209
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,675
and I stayed up late... finishing her present.

210
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,990
Karen wasn't in her room.

211
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,839
She was always so considerate,

212
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,919
I couldn't believe
she'd gone off without telling me.

213
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,990
Then I remembered there was an eclipse.
She might have gone to watch it at the pond.

214
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,156
Karen?

215
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,635
Karen, where are you?

216
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,960
Mary! John!

217
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,238
Tom? Tom Colley!

218
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,999
Karen?

219
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,993
Karen!

220
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,996
Karen!

221
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,791
They searched the ruins...
but there was no sign of Karen.

222
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,956
No sign at all.

223
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,516
Didn't the other kids
know what happened to her?

224
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,479
Why was she blindfolded?

225
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,071
They said it was part of a game.

226
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,110
They used to meet in the chapel.

227
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,116
Sometimes there seems to be
something out there.

228
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,114
Sometimes... I hear someone
whispering in the wind.

229
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,035
Mrs Aylwood, what do you think
happened to Karen?

230
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,029
I think she's still out there.

231
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,711
- What nonsense.
- I told you there was a ghost.

232
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,549
As long as it keeps out of the house,
I can live with it.

233
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,231
For heaven's sake! I knew Mrs Aylwood
was strange, but this is ridiculous.

234
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,797
I did see something in the mist at the pond.
That's why I fell in.

235
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,912
We'll always be grateful
to her for saving you,

236
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,875
but I won't have her filling your head
with these far-fetched fantasies.

237
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,592
Excuse me.

238
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,349
- I'll catch you later. I want to watch Mike.
- OK.

239
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,278
She seems less moody today.

240
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,429
This is what she needs. It'll do her good.
Knight on shining motorcycle.

241
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,758
- How many sandwiches do we have?
- Four for me and one for you!

242
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,439
Come on!

243
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,034
Come on, Mike!

244
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,591
- Hi, guys!
- Hi.

245
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,951
Grab a sandwich
before your sister eats them all.

246
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,116
Ellie, let's get closer.

247
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,029
Well, be careful now.

248
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,235
- There he is!
- There's Mike!

249
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,276
Jan! Come quick!

250
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,311
What is it?

251
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,639
Quickly!

252
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,470
Jan, quickly!

253
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,153
Wow! Did you see that?

254
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,393
- What did you want?
- I didn't want you. Nerak did.

255
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,709
- It's lucky you moved off that rock.
- It wasn't luck.

256
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,435
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing. Forget it.

257
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,998
- It's just been a crazy kind of week all round.
- Do you want to talk about it?

258
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,278
Mrs Aylwood told me that Karen,
her daughter, disappeared years ago,

259
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,870
when she was about my age,
and was never seen again.

260
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,633
If Karen was murdered, that would explain
her haunting the woods, wouldn't it?

261
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,833
Mrs Aylwood said there were three kids
with Karen that night.

262
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,670
One was John Keller,
and there was a Tom something. Collier?

263
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,556
Tom Colley. He lives in the woods
in the old lodge. Kind of a hermit.

264
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,993
And there was a girl. Mary... Mary Pierce.

265
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,719
- Mary Pierce?
- Yeah.

266
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,276
That was my mother's name
before she married Dad.

267
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,634
It was a long time ago. It's best forgotten.

268
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,470
- How come you never told me?
- It happened years before you were born.

269
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,118
I remember your dad saying it's important
to live in the present and leave the past.

270
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,756
There's something about those woods
that bothers you.

271
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,476
You never go near them,
not even to take the short cut to the village.

272
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,912
Across that rickety old bridge?
I should say not.

273
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,874
Mum, what do you think
really happened to Karen Aylwood?

274
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,272
I think she ran away from home.

275
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,838
I don't know why she did,
but it's the only logical explanation.

276
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,310
What were the four of you doing?

277
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,511
We were just... just larking about.

278
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,956
It was John Keller's idea.

279
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,280
It was... just a game.

280
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,714
Then there was a... sudden summer storm.

281
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,912
Lightning struck the belfry.

282
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,032
The whole thing was aflame.

283
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,920
We ran out.

284
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,192
At least... three of us did.

285
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,238
I've never been back to that place again.

286
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,435
Look what Daddy made me
to watch the eclipse on Saturday.

287
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,111
- I can show you how to make one.
- Not now. Mike's taking us riding.

288
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,470
I'll get ready.

289
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,349
- Mom said she'd only be a minute.
- That means ten.

290
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,392
- I wish you didn't have to go.
- So do I.

291
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,912
But if I don't, singers, dancers
and musicians will be unemployed.

292
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,635
- Jan, I'll be back in time for supper.
- OK.

293
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,833
- See if you can find some peanut butter.
- Crunchy or smooth?

294
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,190
- Smooth!
- Crunchy!

295
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,073
OK, I'll handle it. Have a good ride.

296
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,918
- Bye.
- Bye.

297
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,236
- Bye!
- Bye!

298
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,035
Good riding, Ellie. Ride ahead
and make sure the path's clear of Indians.

299
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,995
It gets me out of the way so you two
can be alone, doesn't it? See you.

300
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,080
Come on. Come on, Snowball. Let's go.

301
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,075
I tried to talk to Mum about Karen.

302
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,716
She was very evasive.
She really didn't want to talk about it at all.

303
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,355
Come on, you guys. Hurry up!

304
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,676
Let go back through the woods.

305
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,559
- No, Mike, I don't think we should.
- Oh, come on!

306
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,470
Help! Help me!

307
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,834
Help! Mike, help!

308
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,433
- Stop, Snowball!
- Hang on!

309
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,429
Cocoa! Help!

310
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,154
Mike! Help!

311
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,635
Stop! Cocoa, stop!

312
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,956
Cocoa!

313
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,036
Anybody there?

314
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,235
Is anyone in there?

315
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,398
Mike!

316
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,594
Are you OK?

317
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,110
- That man!
- It was Tom Colley. He didn't hurt you?

318
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,678
I saw Karen's face again!
In the chapel. In a coffin!

319
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,950
It's only a reflection.

320
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,994
It couldn't have been my reflection.
I wasn't standing here.

321
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,512
I was back there. It was Karen, her image.

322
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,076
She was lying in that coffin
as if she were dead.

323
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,549
I think I was sent here for a reason.

324
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,072
You were on a runaway horse.
He could have bolted in any direction.

325
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,034
He bolted because
something in the woods spooked him.

326
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,196
Don't build it up into a...

327
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,074
Mike!

328
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,559
What made the windows break?

329
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,117
The wind. It just came
blasting through the chapel.

330
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,675
But there wasn't any wind outside.

331
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,475
Overlapping circles. What does it mean?

332
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,838
- Can't we go now, Jan?
- Sure we can, Ellie. Come on, Jan.

333
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,876
Mike. There was a shadow of a triangle
on this coffin when I came in.

334
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,959
The same triangle
that's on the window in my bedroom.

335
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,392
These circles, they must mean something.

336
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,276
There was a circle
on the water at the pond, too.

337
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,596
It was strange.

338
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,636
I've seen her, Mr Keller.
As God's my witness, I've seen her.

339
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,791
- She was in the chapel, she was.
- You're drunk.

340
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,389
Not then, I wasn't.

341
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,397
She was there, I tell you.

342
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,958
She come in and went right to the coffin
and looked inside.

343
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,516
- That's impossible.
- Listen!

344
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,596
It's thundering.

345
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,638
There was thunder and lightning
that other night. The night we...

346
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,355
Now, I've told you
never to talk about that night!

347
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,998
All that time gone by, and her looking
like it was yesterday it happened.

348
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,834
- How could that be?
- Get hold of yourself, man!

349
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,590
It's been nearly 30 years.

350
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,319
Now, none of us could look the same,
could we?

351
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,359
There.

352
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,069
What was it I seen, then?

353
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,035
Has she come back from the grave
to haunt us for what we done, Mr Keller?

354
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,030
Is it the ghost of Karen I seen?

355
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,756
Works every time!

356
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,236
We should bring Ellie.
It might curb her appetite.

357
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,552
- What took you so long?
- I saw her again.

358
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,797
- What are you talking about?
- In the mirrors.

359
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,835
She was reaching out, begging me,
pleading with me to help her.

360
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,755
- She's trapped and needs my help.
- Oh, come on, Jan!

361
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,754
- It means something, Mike.
- You're not making sense.

362
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,428
There's something I've got to do.

363
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,077
Maybe she wants me to find out
what really happened that night.

364
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,638
- How?
- I don't know, but I've got to find out.

365
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,559
Stay!

366
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,834
Didn't you see the signs?
This is private property!

367
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,431
Mr Keller, I had to see you.
It's about Karen Aylwood.

368
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,914
- What about Karen Aylwood?
- She needs help.

369
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,793
- How would you know that?
- I've seen her.

370
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,877
- Where?
- In mirrors.

371
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,151
Mirrors. You see yourself as Karen?

372
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,193
No! It was her image!

373
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,912
Why was she blindfolded in the chapel?
I've gotta know what happened that night!

374
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,910
Why do you? You're a stranger here.
It's none of your business.

375
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,231
Don't you see? She needs my help.
She's trapped somewhere...

376
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,719
That's enough. I've better things to do
than listen to hysterical fantasies.

377
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,549
What happened to Karen
was a tragedy that touched us all,

378
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,354
changed us all, but it's best forgotten!

379
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,030
- Have you ever forgotten?
- Get out of here!

380
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,710
- Mr Keller, please.
- I said, clear out.

381
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,598
Tom Colley?

382
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,839
Tom Colley?

383
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,190
Please, don't be angry.
I didn't mean to come inside.

384
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,039
I called but nobody answered!

385
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,511
- You ain't no ghost.
- I'm the girl you saw in the chapel.

386
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,471
You ain't Karen come back to haunt us.

387
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,076
Why would she do that?

388
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,831
Can't talk about that.
Mr Keller, he said not to.

389
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,073
Nasty poacher hurt its paw,
but old Tom'll make it right.

390
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,796
Like he did for you, eh?

391
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,235
Nearly right now, ain't you?

392
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,393
Not like them poor little ones there.

393
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,037
When I finds 'em like that, dead,
I buries 'em.

394
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,278
Tom, was Karen dead when you found her?

395
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,436
Never found Karen. Looked and looked.

396
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,954
Here. Hold.

397
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,679
It won't hurt you none.
They know when you try to help.

398
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,310
- Karen needs your help, Tom.
- Needs me?

399
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,676
Yes, she needs you.

400
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,110
But Karen's gone.

401
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:47,631
- Tom, if you knew Karen was trapped...
- Awful things, traps. They hurt.

402
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,313
- You'd set her free, wouldn't you?
- If I could find her.

403
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,993
You don't have to, Tom. All you have to do
is tell me what happened in the chapel.

404
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,995
Why did you blindfold her?

405
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,558
What was it you did?
You and Mary Pierce and John Keller?

406
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,997
Mr Keller said mustn't talk about that.

407
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,835
- Mary Pierce said you were playing a game.
- She said?

408
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,838
Yes, Tom. What kind of game?

409
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,758
Ring Round the Roses, it was.

410
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,829
Never meant to harm Karen.

411
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,954
Loved Karen. Wouldn't ever hurt her.

412
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,916
There was three of us.

413
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,275
Me and Mary made our way
to the secret meeting place, the old chapel.

414
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,755
We had blindfolded Karen.

415
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,512
That was what John Keller had told us to do.
She was the new one, you see.

416
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,393
John Keller was already in there.

417
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,351
You have been brought to this place to prove
yourself worthy of our secret society.

418
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,838
We number only three. We alone
have passed this test of courage.

419
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,554
Many have tried and failed.

420
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,716
Once we link hands, you must not show fear,

421
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,268
you must not speak, you must not remove
the blindfold, you must not move at all.

422
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,873
We shall hold hands around you and you
must not break the circle of our friendship.

423
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,471
Whatever happens, whatever we say or do,
you must abide by our code.

424
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,389
Banish all thoughts from your mind.
Do you understand?

425
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,556
Let us join hands...

426
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,270
<i>...</i>and concentrate.

427
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,830
Mary Pierce, Tom Colley and I, John Keller,

428
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,875
we are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood,
willing you to be as one with us.

429
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,551
We ask the question, is this person worthy...

430
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,990
She wasn't there any more.

431
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,517
When the bell come down,
she was gone already.

432
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,837
- Are you sure?
- I told 'em what I seen.

433
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,352
"Where could she have gone?" they says.
There was no other way out.

434
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,475
And they looked and looked...
and never found nothin'.

435
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,476
Tom...

436
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,875
Nice to me, she was.

437
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,356
So nice.

438
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,749
She was my friend.

439
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,317
Ellie.

440
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,554
Where'd you hear that song?

441
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,515
From Jan. She was humming it at the pond
the day she fell in the water.

442
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,552
Come in, child. There's something
I want to show you. I think you'll like it.

443
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,799
- My mother said I was never to bother you.
- It's no bother.

444
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,198
Come on. I was just about
to have some tea and cakes.

445
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,552
OK!

446
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,710
This belonged to my daughter.

447
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,231
I gave it to her on her fifth birthday.
She loved it.

448
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,558
She played it at night
before she went to sleep.

449
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,231
It's the same tune you heard at the pond.

450
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,313
Listen.

451
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,553
Your sister tells me you hear... other things.

452
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,195
Voices that tell you to... do things?

453
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,430
I was just dreaming.

454
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,756
Not when you named Nerak.

455
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,110
She named herself.

456
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,390
Listen, child. Listen to the music.

457
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,352
See if you can hear that voice again.

458
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,313
- Mrs Aylwood.
- Hi, Jan.

459
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,114
Look at the music box. Isn't it pretty?

460
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,917
In a minute, Ellie. I've something to tell
Mrs Aylwood. I just came from Tom Colley's.

461
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,510
He said it was some kind
of initiation ceremony.

462
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,633
He said there was a flash of light,
just like you saw,

463
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,116
but when the bell crashed,
Karen was already gone.

464
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,515
There was no other way out.

465
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,316
That's what Tom Colley said.
The bell crashed. Karen was already gone.

466
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,115
Karen. Must help Karen.

467
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,557
Must help.

468
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,355
No! We must listen.

469
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,314
How can we help Karen?

470
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,479
Door. Must open door.

471
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,036
- What door? Where?
- Chapel.

472
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,711
Soon! Very soon! Help Karen very soon!

473
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,233
Karen, tell us how.

474
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,035
No, not Karen, but need help.

475
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:56,155
- If you're not Karen, who are you?
- Tell me what to do, Karen, please!

476
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,794
No! Not Karen!

477
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,956
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

478
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,469
- Who are you?
- Ellie!

479
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,956
- What have you done to her?
- It just happened.

480
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,436
I didn't want to hurt Ellie! I love her!

481
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,073
Mom?

482
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,914
Mom...

483
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,796
It's all right, baby.
Everything is gonna be all right now.

484
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,790
I'm taking you out of here. I'm taking
both of you away from here tonight.

485
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,232
No! You can't. Not now, Mom!

486
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,790
It's not Karen outside there.
Don't you understand? It's someone else!

487
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,595
You get your things ready.
We're leaving here right now.

488
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,038
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

489
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,789
- The battery's shorting.
- It's trying to stop us.

490
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,956
Nothing's trying to stop us.

491
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,272
- We must go back.
- Don't be ridiculous.

492
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,471
- If we go back, they'll start again!
- Jan, stop it. Just stop it!

493
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,113
- What are you doing?
- We have to get off the bridge!

494
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,675
Come on! Get out!

495
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,438
- Enough of this hysteria! Give me the keys!
- I can't!

496
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,115
Sorry she made you angry.

497
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,080
You're not Karen. I know that.

498
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:05,599
I don't know who you are,
but, please, leave my little sister alone.

499
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,873
- Stop that.
- Mom, I can't. I can't stop!

500
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,710
There's something I've got to do,
or Ellie and I'll go on being haunted!

501
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,912
Whatever is out there
won't tell me what it wants!

502
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,395
Stop it this minute!

503
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,953
Mom, I'm scared.

504
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,915
Whatever it is out there,
it's not going to use you, either of you.

505
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,554
Not Karen!

506
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,716
We've got to hurry!

507
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,076
Nearly too late.

508
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,955
- Hardly ever happens.
- What hardly ever happens?

509
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,032
Ellie, you said it hardly ever happens.
What does it mean?

510
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,758
I don't know, Jan.

511
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,916
I can't remember.

512
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,715
"Do again tomorrow."

513
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,876
Do what?

514
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,436
I don't know.

515
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,676
I'm scared.

516
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,634
Good, you're up. Mom said not to wake you.
Seen my thing to watch the eclipse?

517
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,558
No.

518
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:44,471
Dad says you can't look straight at the sun
or it'll ruin your eyes.

519
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,753
- I hope he gets here in time to see it.
- Daddy's coming?

520
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,397
Mom called him.
Help me look, Jan. It's nearly too late.

521
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,431
<i>Nearly too late.</i>

522
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,835
Here it is!

523
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,315
That's funny. I looked in there before.

524
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,515
We can all take turns using it.
It hardly ever happens.

525
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,438
<i>Hardly ever happens.</i>

526
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,354
- What hardly ever happens?
- I just told you. The eclipse.

527
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,951
There are lots of moon eclipses,
but a sun eclipse is special.

528
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,556
What time does it start?

529
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,399
12.30. Oh, rats!

530
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,515
When Mike did this, it came out elephants,
not Ring Around the Rosey!

531
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,029
<i>Ring Round the Roses, it was.</i>

532
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,439
What's wrong?

533
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,795
Nothing. Tell Mom I'm going back to sleep.

534
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,639
- Hello?
- <i>You gotta do something for me!</i>

535
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,992
- Jan, what's wrong?
- I think I know what those circles meant.

536
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,149
- The overlapping ones meant an eclipse.
- There's an eclipse today.

537
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,830
And the circle at the pond
meant a circle of people.

538
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,397
I can't explain it all,
but I have to get Keller, Tom and your mom

539
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,239
to the chapel now before the eclipse.

540
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,514
I need your help. Tell her anything.
Say it's a matter of life or death.

541
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,719
Jan?

542
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,590
Where are you going?

543
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,874
I'm going to the chapel with John Keller,
Tom Colley and Mary Fleming.

544
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,073
I want them to repeat
the ceremony they held, linking hands,

545
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,750
like in a seance
when people make objects move.

546
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,795
- I think that's what happened to Karen...
- No! You mustn't do that!

547
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,835
Whatever happened to my Karen
could happen to you.

548
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,275
Mrs Aylwood, I have to do it.

549
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,518
Whatever is haunting Ellie and me
will never leave us alone.

550
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,436
God be with you, child.

551
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,195
- Karen Aylwood's dead!
- How do you know that?

552
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,995
She never would have put her mother
through suffering!

553
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,317
Part of the suffering is not knowing.

554
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,159
Maybe we can find out what happened,

555
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,753
how she disappeared before the bell fell,
or how she died, if she died.

556
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,714
I told you before, it's none of your business.

557
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,957
Mr Keller, it was your idea, wasn't it?

558
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,589
The secret society?
The initiation ceremony?

559
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,791
Don't you wanna know the truth?

560
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,355
Who do you think you are to disrupt lives
and reopen old wounds?

561
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,949
They never really healed, did they?

562
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,948
Isn't that why you lock yourself away
in that dreary house,

563
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,276
a prisoner of your own guilt?

564
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,517
Mr Keller, I don't have much time.

565
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,950
But you owe it to Karen

566
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,995
and you owe it to yourself
to try to help make this happen.

567
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:35,432
- They should have been here by now.
- They won't come. Not back to this place.

568
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,679
But they are! They're coming!

569
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,076
Nerak, look...

570
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,276
Nerak, get over here!

571
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,520
Nerak! Come back!

572
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,314
- I can't.
- You must.

573
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,990
We're running out of time.
We can't waste it arguing.

574
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,192
It may not work, Mrs Fleming,
but we must try!

575
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,550
We have to repeat the ceremony.

576
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,713
No. No!

577
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,959
Whatever happened 30 years ago
was during an eclipse.

578
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:52,392
The same thing's happening now,
so maybe we can bring her back.

579
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,278
Nerak!

580
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,634
Nerak!

581
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,714
Nerak!

582
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,113
Nerak!

583
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,594
Nerak!

584
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,993
Nerak!

585
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,473
Nerak.

586
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,154
Don't do it. When Karen did it, something
went wrong. She was never seen again.

587
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,113
The circle won't be broken this time.

588
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:50,795
No, no, no! We ran away once before
and we've regretted it ever since.

589
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,912
- We must not run out again!
- The blindfold.

590
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,752
Mr Keller, I have to know exactly
what you said and did that night.

591
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,080
- I told Karen...
- To me, Mr Keller. I'm Karen now.

592
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,478
- Say it to me!
- Very well.

593
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,036
Once we link hands, you must not show fear,

594
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:31,792
you must not speak, you must not remove
the blindfold, you must not move at all.

595
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,157
We shall hold hands and you must not break
our circle of friendship.

596
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,275
- If anything happens to Jan, I'll break it.
- Don't interfere! Move away!

597
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:49,430
We are looking upon you, Karen Aylwood,
willing you to be as one with us.

598
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,677
We ask the question: is this person worthy?

599
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,111
<i>Listen.</i>

600
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,677
<i>Ready to return.</i>
<i>I have been trapped on your planet.</i>

601
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,997
<i>Karen was my intervention.</i>

602
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,279
<i>We exchanged places by mistake.</i>

603
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,712
<i>Magnetic pull of the eclipse</i>
<i>transferred our positions.</i>

604
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,518
<i>Now exchange places again.</i>

605
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,310
- <i>Almost time.</i>
- Ellie!

606
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,114
<i>I must return home.</i>

607
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,515
Where's home?

608
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,875
What happened to Karen?

609
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,112
<i>Continue. Continue.</i>

610
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:40,235
<i>My power comes from you,</i>
<i>the three linked as before,</i>

611
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,074
<i>when darkness comes at noon.</i>

612
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:49,308
- The eclipse.
- <i>It's almost time. Hurry.</i>

613
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:54,950
Go on with the ceremony, Mr Keller!
We've gotta beat the eclipse.

614
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,351
Come on!

615
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:06,588
We shall hold hands around you.
You must not break our circle of friendship.

616
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,473
With joined hands,

617
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,832
we call upon the powers of the universe

618
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,280
to grant us...

619
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,351
This is our chance!
Don't break the circle!

620
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,711
Mary. Give me your hand!

621
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,792
<i>Must return home.</i>

622
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,754
<i>Time's running out. Hurry.</i>

623
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,350
- <i>Hurry.</i>
- But where is Karen?

624
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,516
<i>Karen was in the way.</i>

625
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,589
<i>Mistake. Transferred by mistake.</i>

626
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,475
<i>In error we exchanged places.</i>

627
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,478
<i>Karen's still in my dimension.</i>

628
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,194
<i>Trapped and suspended.</i>

629
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,756
<i>Must reverse the process.</i>

630
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,712
<i>Concentrate.</i>

631
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,236
<i>Exchange persons again. Transfer back.</i>

632
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,479
<i>Now. Later too late.</i>

633
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,713
<i>Now.</i>

634
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,309
<i>Now. Now.</i>

635
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,270
- It's taking me!
- Jan, you have to get out of that!

636
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,357
I can't!

637
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,437
Jan, move! Move!

638
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,232
Break the ring! Break it!

639
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,396
It's Karen.

640
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,358
We brought her back!

641
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,639
Jan.

642
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,956
Karen.

643
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,471
You're home.
