Y-yeah.

00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,677
Or you'll die?

547

Yeah.
But you didn't eat me.

Um, exhume means
to, like, revive.

00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,516

I know, it's so stupid.

Like you're
attracted to him?
No, I don't...

721
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:33,261
Like he could be
your boyfriend?

722
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,097

Okay? But, Julie,
this is weird.

was still working

that's wrong with you.

be a teenager.

ever going to buy that.

get you even close
enough to tell them.

As soon as they saw you,

your head to bits.

to go to my dad.

It was your mom that
was the reasonable one.

that grounded you
for a year

Peach Schnapps.

Well, what other choice
do we have, Nora?

808
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,519
{SIGHS} Still, we'd have to
get him through the city.

definitely see you.

that I was saving
for a special occasion

isn't going to happen.

a little bit of
foundation,

maybe a little blush.
Probably a lot of blush.

They're...

I don't know.
They're somehow
curing themselves.

You think they're curing
themselves? How is that?

880
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:33,027
I saw it.
It is really happening.

No. You know what is
happening, Julie?

is every day

883

there are more of them
and less of us.

curing themselves.

Okay? So I want you
to wake up!

He took care of me.

I triggered
something in him

902
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,663
and that must have sparked
something in all of them...

904
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,366

We're getting better.

No. Things don't get better.
Things get worse.

910

People get bit,
then they get infected,

911
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,082
then I shoot them
in the head.

No, Dad...
That's what happened

913
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:04,785

what's going to happen to him.
