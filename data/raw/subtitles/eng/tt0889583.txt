1
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,798
What's up? I'm Brüno.

2
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,793
I live in Austria's coolest city, Vienna.
No big deal. Whatever.

3
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,475
I am the host of Funkyzeit,

4
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,435
the most important TV fashion show
in any German-speaking country,

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,399
apart from Germany.

6
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,514
Funkyzeit is über influential.

7
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,192
In fact, Austrian fashionistas live their lives
according to my "In or Out" list.

8
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,237
In! Autism.

9
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,078
Aus. Chlamydia.

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,037
Why is autism so cool at the moment?

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,668
-Because it's funny.
-Great.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Through Funkyzeit,
ich have done interviews

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,840
mit everyone in the Euro-fashion world.

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,996
Can you look into this camera and just say,

15
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,714
"You're watching Funkyzeit mit Brüno"?

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,470
You are watching Funkyzeit programme
with Brüno, and it's really a great show.

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,237
Yeah, that's cool. Can you do it, like,
even more like a kind of black guy?

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,315
You know, like an afrikanischer...

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,714
-Like this?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,549
You are watching
Funkyzeit programme with Brüno.

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,877
Yo, man. Fuck, man. Welcome to the jungle.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,549
Something maybe a bit more crazy.

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,069
Maybe show a bit of skin
or something like that.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,875
-No, I don't think so.
-Or what about just like one Kugelsack?

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,353
One of the balls?

26
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,715
No.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,869
And the most exciting
and amazing thing in the town,

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,949
from the fashion streets of Milan,
only for the German girls, my great hairs.

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,229
Yo, man.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,795
Modelling, a lot of people think it's easy.

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,309
But it's the hardest job in the world, isn't it?

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,956
It's very hard. Standing in heels all day,
and everyone's watching you,

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,674
so you have to make sure your walk is good.
And, yeah.

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,756
Yeah, it's really hard,
'cause you've gotta remember, like,

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,997
to put your right leg forward
and then put your left leg forward

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,712
and then, like, which one now?

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,753
Right leg again, and then, like, the left one.
And then sometimes you even have to turn.

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,351
Yeah. And especially the turn. It's so scary.

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,192
Being the host from Funkyzeit

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,959
means Brüno's always
seated on the front row.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,952
Hi. How are you?

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,399
You have to lose some weight.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,034
-The kettle is calling the pot black.
-Yeah?

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,952
Put your shoulders back.
This is a fashion show, not a slave auction.

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,993
Mein personal assistant,
Kookus, is my rock.

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,159
He's also mein stylist.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,119
-Do you think the glasses are too much?
-Yeah, I'd lose them.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,434
They're too much like, "Look at me.

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,551
"Hey, everybody, look at me.
Look at my glasses."

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,193
-Yeah.
-"Everybody, like, stare at my glasses."

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,151
He's also my nutritionist.

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,554
Yeah, that is good.

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,468
I have a second assistant,
but ich can't remember its name.

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,073
Brüno has known true love twice in his life.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,069
Once, for 7 minutes with Milli from
Milli und Vanilli. No big deal. Whatever.

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,311
But for the last 9 years,
ich have been head über heels in love

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,477
mit a pygmy flight attendant called Diesel.

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,511
We're just like an ordinary couple,
you know, boring, stay-at-home types.

59
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,633
-Oh, my God. I feel it.
You're getting so big. -Ja.

60
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,550
-How much do you want?
-Just half a glass. Otherwise I get too giggly.

61
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,996
In September 2008,
I left for Milan Fashion Week

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,680
to shoot a new season of Funkyzeit.

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,309
Brüno had backstage access for
the hottest show of the week, de la Prada.

64
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,437
So I wore the jewel of mein wardrobe,
a suit made entirely out of Velcro.

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,515
I'm wearing this.

66
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,235
This is a prototype.
It's a Velcro suit made by Frederic Worms.

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,315
Pretty cool, right?

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,512
It is. I was looking at it, and can I have one?

69
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,951
-Well, it's a prototype. It's a one-off.
-Okay.

70
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,593
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Okay...

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,039
-Also... Yeah.
-Can you go out, please?

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,229
We'll get out, but don't push me.

73
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,830
Yeah. Okay, no listen.
We haven't finished the thing.

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,995
-You go out now.
-Yeah.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,394
Yeah, wait a second.

76
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,078
Take... Get this off...

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,275
Stop!

78
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,998
-Thank you.
-Can someone help this guy?

79
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,439
Can you take...

80
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,759
Wait. Get me out of this.
Get me out of this.

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,271
Brüno was aus.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,076
For the second time in a century,

83
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,317
the world had turned
on Austria's greatest man

84
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,712
just because he was brave enough
to try something new.

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,196
-No.
-Okay.

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,351
Brüno was schwarz-listed.

87
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,154
-I'm on the front row.
-I don't think so.

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,755
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,868
Und worst of all...

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,075
Hello?

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,555
...ich was fired from Funkyzeit.

92
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,472
Ich realised that night that the fashion world
was superficial und vacuous.

93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,753
So, I decided instead to go to Los Angeles
to become a celebrity.

94
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,352
Ich was going to be
the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler.

95
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,912
What? I'm not coming.

96
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,957
-Why not?
-Because you out. You humiliate me.

97
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,358
-I'm so sorry I humiliate you.
-Okay. Gotta go.

98
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,272
Bye, baby, I love you.

99
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,119
Diesel, I love you. Diesel.

100
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,438
Ich arrived in LA

101
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,553
und cunningly avoided
being snapped by the waiting paparazzi.

102
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,719
No photos, please. Do you want
another Diana on your hands?

103
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,393
Mein Plan was to become

104
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,398
the biggest gay movie star
since Schwarzenegger.

105
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,238
Maximum Santzgaut!

106
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,750
Also, ich headed to my first meeting
mit a Hollywood über agent.

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,359
So my name's Brüno.
I was born in Klagenfurt.

108
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,554
I'm 19 years old. And, of course,
you'll know me as the host of Funkyzeit.

109
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,712
Okay. Well, I understand
that you took a look at a side

110
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,991
that I wanted you to think about
from the Jerry Maguire show.

111
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,839
And I wouldn't mind
hearing you try that out.

112
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,234
Okay, great.

113
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,478
-"Jerry enters."
-No.

114
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,989
-"Dorothy seated."
-Just start with the word "hello."

115
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,516
"Hello. Hello.

116
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,391
"I'm looking for my wife!

117
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,237
-"Shut up, women." That was improvisation.
-Fine.

118
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,873
"I couldn't hear your voice
or laugh about it with you."

119
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,798
-All right, let me stop... Wait.
-No, wait, wait. I...

120
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,117
Let me stop for 2 minutes.
Let me stop you right there.

121
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,828
Nowhere in the script does it say

122
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,074
he pauses for an inordinate period of time.

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,039
You're here because
you are looking to do feature films.

124
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,479
I wanna be a star.

125
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,874
-In?
-In a huge Hollywood movie.

126
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,550
-Can you make that happen?
-No.

127
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,749
-What?
-I definitely cannot.

128
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,314
But he did get me a starring role
in a top TV show as an extra.

129
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,870
All right, picture's next.
Last looks, please.

130
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,675
Set.

131
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,313
-Background.
-Action.

132
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,348
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

133
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,439
it gives me no pleasure at all
to speak to you this afternoon.

134
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,351
The defendant, as you know,

135
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,713
has served our municipality
for more than 12 years as city controller.

136
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,877
So I was pained to learn that his debts

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,949
compelled him to accept
hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.

138
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,198
-Cut!
-Just do a little bit less.

139
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,754
-More or less?
-Less.

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,519
-Less. Okay.
-Yeah.

141
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,273
Sure. Thank you.

142
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,395
-Set.
-Action.

143
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,509
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

144
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,632
I'm afraid it gives me no pleasure at all
to speak to you this afternoon.

145
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,079
As you know, the defendant has
served our municipality as city controller

146
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,474
for more than 12 years,

147
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,993
and I have known him personally
for most of that time.

148
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,475
So I was very pained to learn that

149
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,149
his personal debts
compelled him to accept bribes.

150
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,474
-Cut!
-Here, I'll take that.

151
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,715
-Okay.
-Thank you.

152
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,875
Sorry.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,319
-Should we just go again?
-Okay.

154
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,829
As you know, the defendant

155
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,918
has served this municipality as
city controller for more than 12 years,

156
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,511
and I have personally known him
for most of that time.

157
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,915
That is why I was very pained to learn...

158
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,350
Cut. Sorry, I'm not feeling this one.
Could we go again?

159
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,069
This way.

160
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,716
You were actually my second choice.

161
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,358
I was going to go to the salon that maintains
Salma Hayek's inner thighs,

162
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,590
but the team that do it were booked up
for the next 4 days

163
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,392
because she's got the Elle Style Awards.

164
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,713
And they said they're, like, really,
really exhausted after they do her.

165
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,593
They're exhausted
after they wax Salma Hayek?

166
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,551
She must have a lot of hair.

167
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,275
They say that after a waxing,
there's enough to stuff a mattress.

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,151
Well. Speaking of rectums,
let's get you clean.

169
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,597
-Okay. There we go.
-There's not much.

170
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,835
Yeah, sure.

171
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,075
There you go. Now there's wax in there.

172
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,833
Telephone.

173
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,951
-Hello?
-Hey, how you doing, man?

174
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,638
Lloyd, hi. How are you?

175
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,593
I just got off the phone with the network.
They've agreed to do a screening.

176
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,553
Great! Das is all maximum Santzgaut!

177
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,309
In 2 days. I got them to pay
for a focus group for the show.

178
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,112
I think you just scraped my anus.

179
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,468
I did. I got you clean.

180
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,990
My stinker is slightly burning.
Is that normal?

181
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,075
What?

182
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,192
No, that was to the lady who is...
I'm in the salon, yes.

183
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,117
She's just washing my Arschwitz.

184
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,312
Is there any way we can get something
together enough to put it on?

185
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,590
-Okay, sure.
-All right. I'm gonna call them right now.

186
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,352
Are you using Vaseline?

187
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,515
No, lotion.

188
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,552
Could you take your finger
out of my Arschenholer?

189
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,830
All right. I think, guys, we're finished.

190
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,793
Once again, "Can you take my finger,
your finger out of my ass,"

191
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,353
is what the guy just said on the phone.

192
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,233
No, Lloyd, I was not speaking to you.
I was just talking to the woman here.

193
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,509
Who's got the audio?

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,750
I want to hear the audio back.
I want you to hear...

195
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,871
I want you to hear what this fool is saying.

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,833
Play it back. Talking about what?
His asshole.

197
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,119
Can you be quiet?

198
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,155
Hello, hello. Hey, can you come in?

199
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,998
Do any of you guys
want to make some more money?

200
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,159
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi.

201
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,078
-I'm Brüno. Great to have you here.
-It's nice to meet you.

202
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,509
Come and sit on our great furniture.

203
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,715
These are our Mexican chair people.

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,675
Demi Moore has 2 of them in her house.

205
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,359
Yeah, if you sit here.

206
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,078
If you sit on that one.

207
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
Also, so tell me about
your humanitarian work.

208
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,677
How important is it for you
to help other people?

209
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,589
Helping other people is so vital to my life.

210
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,478
It's like the air that I breathe
and the water that I drink.

211
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,919
-Please, have some water.
-It is extremely, extremely important for me.

212
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,271
You give love to other people
and you get love back in spades.

213
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,674
And I just feel like that's been my life.

214
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,590
Great. You must be hungry.
Let's bring in some food.

215
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,193
Oh, my God.

216
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,918
-Have some.
-Yeah, this is really bad for me.

217
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,349
I'm sorry. This is really not good.

218
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,879
We're leaving.

219
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,993
Come back, please.
Can you please come back?

220
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,110
Yes, yes, I understand.
But I was thinking...

221
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,518
Okay, but... Okay. Okay.

222
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,512
Yes. Thank you.

223
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,752
Minimum Santzgaut.

224
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,595
Puffy Vater?

225
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,228
Reese Witterspinzel?

226
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,355
Stevie Wunderbar?

227
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,668
Wilhelm Schmidt?

228
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,639
Bradolf Pittler?

229
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,319
I think this focus group is really gonna be

230
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,233
a very interesting example
of how it's gonna play out.

231
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,318
I actually got an interview mit Harrison Ford.

232
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,759
-Very good. Very good.
-Yes.

233
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,553
So, you probably already know, today
we're going to be looking at a new TV show,

234
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
A-List Celebrity Max Out mit Brüno.

235
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,274
-Howdy, I'm Lloyd Robinson.
-Lloyd, Denny Bond.

236
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,038
Hi. Hi. Great.

237
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,436
Me und Lloyd, we haven't actually spoke
since the other day

238
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,994
when I was getting my anus bleached.

239
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,875
We won't go there, please.

240
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,672
-We won't go there. Yeah.
-That was a very

241
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,074
difficult issue on the phone.

242
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,271
And it's very important
what scores you give it,

243
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,675
because if the show scores over an 85%,,

244
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,553
the network's obviously gonna be
very interested. So take a look.

245
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,759
-Absolutely.
-Congratulations.

246
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,479
Who's ready to max out
with loads of celebrities? I am.

247
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,159
Because das ist A-List Celebrity Max Out.

248
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,031
-How are you?
-Great. Thank you for having me.

249
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,798
Okay, so this is the part of the show,

250
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,876
it's called Future Kinder.
People who are pregnant,

251
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,558
we've managed to get the ultrasound photos.

252
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,635
-It's totally great.
-Okay.

253
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,116
Okay, it is Britney's sister.
I can't even remember her name.

254
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,878
-What's her name?
-Jamie Lynn.

255
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,434
Jamie Lynn Spears.
I mean, is she a celebrity?

256
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,515
No.

257
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,476
Okay, let's see
what she's got in her stomach.

258
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,278
All right. What do you think there?
Is that a white-trash foetus?

259
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,628
Yeah. Totally.

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,870
She's got her arms up like she's a A-lister.

261
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,197
Newsflash, you're in a C-lister's womb.
Am I right?

262
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,117
Worse. I think, like, D.

263
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,032
Do you think this kid is retarded?

264
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,038
Definitely the hands look way too big,

265
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,355
and the ears, like,
have not been developed yet.

266
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,358
-Yeah, so keep it or abort it?
-Abort it.

267
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,712
Und now, my exclusive interview
mit Harrison Ford

268
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,509
is only moments away.
But first, some more dancing mit Brüno.

269
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,870
That's right.
It's the time you've all been waiting for.

270
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,394
It's my one-on-one,
exclusive interview mit Harrison Ford.

271
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,915
-Also, here I am mit Harrison Ford.
-Fuck off!

272
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,715
What's that?

273
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,314
That's actually mine.

274
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,629
-More champagne?
-No, I'm fine, thanks.

275
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,955
Brüno!

276
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,152
The end bit was Lloyd's idea.

277
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,638
The last bit was? Lloyd's?

278
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,232
So if you could
describe this show in one sentence...

279
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,437
Can anybody give me one sentence?

280
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,074
-Go ahead.
-The worst piece of crap I have ever seen.

281
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,920
There's always one who's against it. Those...

282
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,439
In any group, there's always one.

283
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,313
What sick human being came up
with something like this?

284
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,590
Well, there's always 2.
There's always 2.

285
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,553
I wanted to poke my eyes out
with hot needles.

286
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,511
You'd have to borrow the needles from me.

287
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,473
Lloyd, we need to distract him

288
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,033
-from listening to this.
-You can't. You can't.

289
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,593
-We need to distract him.
-You can't.

290
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,789
-Kiss me.
-No.

291
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,878
No logical person
would consider a show like this

292
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,709
unless they had
some sort of a mental or moral defect.

293
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,309
Everything.

294
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,635
Oh, my God.

295
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,638
Let me have a look at those.

296
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,638
"The host is a talentless idiot."

297
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,674
Is this the dancing of a talentless idiot?

298
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,628
-I would say that it is.
-Yeah, yeah.

299
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,274
Please, where you going?

300
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,119
Please, this is my career.
I put all my money into this.

301
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,873
I'm here with Congressman Ron Paul,

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,037
who was the 2008 presidential candidate.

303
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,508
So tell me, who are you wearing?

304
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,277
Well, I don't even know
because it's pretty conventional.

305
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,472
And I'm pretty, in that sense, pretty ordinary.

306
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,397
But the message is not ordinary.

307
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,069
Sure.

308
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,993
-Do you want some champagne?
-I don't care for any. No.

309
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,953
There's no ice bucket,
but I know a good place to put it.

310
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,991
Yeah, you were great in there.
Have you done a lot of television before?

311
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,988
Well, off and on throughout the years.
This last year, a tremendous amount.

312
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,718
-Sure.
-I do a lot of them.

313
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,673
Do you want some strawberries

314
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,950
-or maybe some oysters?
-No, I'm okay.

315
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,310
I'm gonna light some candles if it's okay.

316
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,199
Really loosens you up.

317
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,480
Has anyone ever told you
you look like Enrique Iglesias?

318
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,951
Of course not. You're much cuter.

319
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,715
I love music.

320
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,071
And dancing. I used to be a dancer.

321
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,029
-All right! Get out of here!
-What?

322
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,512
-All right, this has ended.
-What's going on?

323
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,073
That guy is queerer than the blazes.
He took his clothes off. Let's get going.

324
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,236
-What happened?
-He's queer. He's crazy.

325
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,078
He put a hit on me. He took his clothes off.

326
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,634
I couldn't even schtupp RuPaul.

327
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,231
How would I become weltfamous?

328
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,439
Ich decided to seek advice
from the wisest guy I'd ever known.

329
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,591
I wanna speak to Milli

330
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,712
from the pop dance group Milli und Vanilli.

331
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,316
Is he in heaven?
And if so, is he in the VIP section there?

332
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,951
He says he's in a place
with green trees and flowers.

333
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,717
Can I ask him if he has any advice for me?

334
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,998
He says there's some sort of thing that you
will set up, like a foundation or something,

335
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,351
where there will be other people involved
that will benefit.

336
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,948
Okay, that's a great idea, 'cause if I do that,
then I'll definitely become world famous.

337
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,349
Absolutely.

338
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,189
There's something that he could do
that could make me incredibly happy.

339
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,671
-Can I kiss him now?
-Of course.

340
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,388
Well, good luck with your life.

341
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,713
Thanks to Milli,
ich could now see clearly

342
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,876
despite having an eyeful of Schpunken.

343
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,278
Charity was a great way to become famous.

344
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,630
Also, Brüno just needed to find
the hottest world tragedy to fix.

345
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,593
I want a charity that doesn't involve
too much effort,

346
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,236
but is gonna really make a difference,
you know, really put me into the A-list.

347
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,193
Is there something that you, like,
that you believe in?

348
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,833
Well, I'm really into issues.

349
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,793
Yeah. Global warming's only getting worse.

350
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,875
-So...
-Great.

351
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,389
Now, I think that would be...
That's something to get involved now,

352
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,229
so, we can just help ease the...

353
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,352
Like, after us, in order to help for our future.

354
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,155
In order for everyone... It's just
a beneficial thing to be involved with now.

355
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,518
I'm really into doing something
maybe for Africa.

356
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,517
-Okay.
-Is that still cool or...

357
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,952
Saving some kind of extinct animal.
What's going extinct right now?

358
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,476
-I don't know, like elephants or something.
-And then make bracelets?

359
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,831
That's so bad. Never mind.
I was gonna say make bracelets out of a...

360
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,633
Make bracelets out of the extinct animal?

361
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,876
That's not gonna really work though,
because you need the...

362
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,116
You can't take from the extinct animal.

363
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,036
What's the coolest type of charity
to get into at the moment?

364
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,078
Save Dafar?

365
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,194
-Save what?
-Save Dafar.

366
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,878
-Save Dafar, yeah.
-Angelina Jolie.

367
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,150
Is that in, like, Iraqi or something like that?

368
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,157
Yeah, that's in the... It's in... Yeah.

369
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,235
Yeah.

370
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,717
Is there anywhere in the world
that no celebrity has tried to fix?

371
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,751
Darfur is the big one now.

372
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,275
-Yeah, no, it is.
-What's the new one? What's Dar-five?

373
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,549
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

374
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,798
Ich was going to become famous
by solving a world problem.

375
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,955
But which one?

376
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,318
Clooney's got Darfur.

377
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,228
Sting's got the Amazon,
and Bono's got AIDS.

378
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,830
Luckily, there was still one shithole
left to fix,

379
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,754
the Middle-earth.

380
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,717
Mein Plan was to get both sides to sign
a peace deal in front of the world's press,

381
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,036
making Brüno über famous.

382
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,955
Hi, I love your hat. It's great.

383
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,272
Hey, great. Is that Marc Jacobs?

384
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,394
Lutz! Lutz! Start the car!

385
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,555
Lutz!

386
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,791
Why are you so anti-hummus?

387
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,278
I mean, isn't pita bread the real enemy?

388
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,234
You're confusing Hamas
with hummus, I believe.

389
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,274
-Hummus has nothing to do with Hamas.
-Do you think

390
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,675
there is a relation
between Hamas and hummus?

391
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,997
So was the founder of Hamas a chef?

392
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,795
He had created the food
and then got lots of followers.

393
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,631
Hummus has nothing to do with Hamas.
It's a food. Okay? We eat it. They eat it.

394
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,759
It's vegetarian. It's healthy. It's beans.

395
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,430
Well, do you both agree on that?

396
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,033
We both agree that hummus is very healthy.

397
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,197
So we're making progress.

398
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,351
Let's try and get a solution, right?

399
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,877
'Cause I'm not gonna be here forever.
Will you, the Palestinians,

400
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,871
agree to give the pyramids back
to the Israelis?

401
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,072
This is in Egypt. Not in Palestine.

402
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,632
I don't care where you put them.
Give them back.

403
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,435
This is about gaining something
for your own people

404
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,235
whether you believe it,
whether you were convinced to do that.

405
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,476
-But in any case...
-All right, okay. Take it easy, girlfriend.

406
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,715
-All right.
-Civil rights...

407
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,116
If I did not get these queens
to sign a peace deal soon,

408
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,912
I would not become famous.

409
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,512
So I decided to think outside
the Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung.

410
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,955
I've written a song that I think
is gonna help us make peace.

411
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,073
In fact, I know it will.

412
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,598
I've written a song

413
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,070
that I hope is gonna bring you two together

414
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,195
It's time for this war to end

415
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,557
Jews and Hindus, you be friends

416
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,309
This is the Middle East

417
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,149
Creating love is my mission

418
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,872
Don't kill each other

419
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,230
Shoot a Christian

420
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,675
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

421
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,393
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

422
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,918
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

423
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,675
Yeah, a bit more than that.

424
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,870
Ich was out of options.

425
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,357
My song hadn't worked, und I didn't have
enough ecstasy for everyone.

426
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,472
Ich was ready to give up
when I suddenly remembered something

427
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,158
that the Jude had said.

428
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,909
In the last few years,
people were kidnapped,

429
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,749
and then they would
broadcast it to the whole world.

430
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,199
-To the whole world?
-Yeah.

431
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,878
So what, the whole world gets to see

432
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,399
-these hostage videos?
-Of course. Of course.

433
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,796
Ich would become famous
by getting kidnapped.

434
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,354
I am going to say something
that is gonna get you so angry

435
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,360
that if you've got a gun on you,
you're gonna pull it out

436
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,552
-and shoot me in the head. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

437
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,714
Your hair is sun damaged.

438
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,399
I'll be honest with you. I want to be famous.

439
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,958
And I want the best guys in the business
to kidnap me. Al-Qaeda is so 2001.

440
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,439
I don't like.

441
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,148
Can I give you guys a word of advice?

442
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,036
Lose the beards, because your King Osama

443
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,312
looks like a kind of dirty wizard
or a homeless Santa.

444
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,757
Get out. Get out now.

445
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,760
Ich was encouraged
to leave the Middle East.

446
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:14,839
Ich was encouraged
to leave the Middle East.

447
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,031
But Brüno had a new plan.

448
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,390
It involved stopping off in Africa

449
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,114
on the way home for a little bit of shopping.

450
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,359
Mein little afrikanischer
Freund was going to get me

451
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,789
on the cover of every magazine.

452
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,955
Also, ich hired a top photographer

453
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,470
und held a casting for
the hottest baby photo shoot ever.

454
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,833
We're gonna do like this religious theme

455
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,317
where my baby is gonna be
on a crucifix playing Jesus

456
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,078
even though my baby's black.
So it's pretty cool, no?

457
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,156
That's cool.
It's kind of like that Madonna video.

458
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,271
Yeah, it's really edgy.
You know, we're turning it on its head.

459
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,958
Why not? Come on. Whatever.

460
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,471
So. We're looking for 2 thieves
to be on the crucifixes next to my baby.

461
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,798
Would you be ready for your baby
to be strung up on a crucifix next to mine?

462
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,514
Fine. Yeah, I don't mind her
being up on a crucifix.

463
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,629
Sure.

464
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,355
Is your baby comfortable with bees,
wasps and hornets?

465
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,710
George is comfortable with everything.
He's fine.

466
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,593
Is he comfortable with dead
or dying animals?

467
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,989
Yes.

468
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,789
Great.

469
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,839
Amateur science?

470
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,949
What do you mean by that?

471
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,518
You know, some untrained people
conducting scientific experiments.

472
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,075
-Should be fine.
-You know,

473
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,031
her mixing the pots of acid and that type...

474
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,553
-Okay.
-And so it's a yes.

475
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,908
-Yes.
-Great.

476
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,838
Is she okay with
extremely rapid acceleration?

477
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,589
Yes.

478
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,795
-Okay.
-Yes.

479
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,912
Does she always have to be in a car seat,
or can she just, like, freestyle it?

480
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,554
Yeah. You can freestyle it,
put her in a car seat. Whatever.

481
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,193
If it looks better without the car seat...

482
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,309
Of course. Of course.

483
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,352
So what? You're travelling fast.
You're not gonna kill it.

484
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,799
Of course. Of course.

485
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,992
Is your baby fine
with antiquated heavy machinery?

486
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,869
Yeah, she's fine. She's been around that.

487
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,991
Would she be fine to operate them?

488
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,439
-Yes.
-Great.

489
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,639
Is your baby fine with lit phosphorus?

490
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,875
Yes.

491
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,718
Excellent. Does he like it?

492
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,832
-Loves it.
-Good.

493
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,277
A little sensitive subject here.
How much does she weigh?

494
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,470
She's about 30 pounds.

495
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,513
-Thirty pounds.
-Yes. Approximately.

496
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,799
Can Olivia lose 10 pounds in the next week?

497
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,270
In the next week, 7 days.

498
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,514
Yeah. I'd have to do whatever I could.

499
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,153
If there's a problem losing the weight,

500
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,556
would you be ready to have Olivia
undergo liposuction?

501
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,633
If that was a last resort
and she didn't lose the few pounds,

502
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,035
then, yeah, we'd have to do that.

503
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,398
Great. Fantastisch news.

504
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,036
We have chosen your baby
to be dressed as a Nazi officer

505
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,674
pushing a wheelbarrow with another baby
as a Jew in it into an oven.

506
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,519
Into an oven?

507
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,876
Congratulations. How do you feel?

508
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,468
-Great, if she got the job. That's great.
-Yeah.

509
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,317
O.J., you're going to be on television.

510
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,436
Welcome back to Today with Richard Bey.

511
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,519
Now, our next guest is a single parent.
Please welcome Brüno.

512
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,835
Where are you from?

513
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,189
I'm from Austria.

514
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,029
Austria. And what are your impressions
of the American people?

515
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,275
You see a lot of them out here.

516
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,279
I gotta say, I love American people,
and I love African-American people.

517
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,073
You're the best. You guys are the best.

518
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,480
All right, all right.
Now, you are a single parent.

519
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,875
-Yeah.
-Most people think that a child

520
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,228
should have 2 parents.

521
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,432
It is, like, really difficult, you know,

522
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,677
bringing up a child without another parent.
Am I right?

523
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,869
-Right.
-Right.

524
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,436
I'm hoping that I don't grow old alone.
Am I right?

525
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,515
True that. True that.

526
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,108
I'm hoping that I find Mr. Right. Am I right?

527
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,195
-No!
-No!

528
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,878
No, no, no.

529
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,279
Well, honey, you need to get it together.
Sugar, you're lost and confused.

530
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,719
-All right, now...
-Listen, you're just jealous

531
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,432
'cause you know I can get any guy here.

532
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,834
Go get them!

533
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,039
You brought your son here today?

534
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,709
-That's right.
-Can we see your son?

535
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,435
Yeah, sure.

536
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,676
No. No.

537
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,519
All right, this is...

538
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,268
-What?
-Where did they allow you

539
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,516
to get your baby from?
Is your baby from Australia?

540
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,552
I was in the Middle East, like,
solving the crisis there.

541
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,272
No big deal. Whatever.

542
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,198
And I flew back here to America,

543
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,949
und I stopped over in this country
called Africa, right?

544
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,992
Africa is a continent, not a country, baby.
Get it right.

545
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,872
Well, it is full of African-Americans.

546
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,276
It's full of Africans.
It's full of people of African descent.

547
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,551
No. That's a racist thing to call them.
African-Americans is the right word.

548
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,318
No. African-Americans are here.

549
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,358
No, they're called
African-Americans, girlfriend.

550
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,515
No, fool.

551
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,676
All right.
So how did you find your son?

552
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,755
I swapped him.

553
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,359
-You swapped him?
-What?

554
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,676
Swapped the baby for what?

555
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,392
-For an iPod.
-What?

556
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,675
Not just any iPod.

557
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,588
One that was, like, limited edition, red.
A U2 iPod. Heard of it?

558
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,348
All right, but wait a second.
You are the baby's father now.

559
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,995
And you chose to dress that baby up
in a T-shirt that says what?

560
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,109
Gayby.

561
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,196
That's not the baby's name, is it?

562
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,880
No. I gave him, like,
a traditional African name.

563
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,553
So what's the baby's name?

564
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,635
O.J.

565
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,909
Stand up, please.

566
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,508
I think you're using him as an accessory.

567
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,110
I think maybe because he's a black baby
that might be your cue,

568
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,879
like how some people walk in the park
with dogs to pick up girls,

569
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,558
that might be your cue
to get maybe a down-low brother.

570
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,477
I don't know. What do you think?

571
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,955
I gotta be honest. He's a real dick magnet.

572
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,912
You brought some photographs
that you took with the child because...

573
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,315
I guess to demonstrate
how much you love the child.

574
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,237
We're going to put them up on this screen.

575
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,112
That's the first shot.

576
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,596
Let's see the next picture.

577
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,352
You're gonna burn in hell for that one.

578
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,549
That's some mess.

579
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,911
All right. Do we have another photo,
or is that the last one?

580
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,359
There we go.

581
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,199
What is going on here?

582
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,551
If I'm having fun,
I want little O.J. to come with me.

583
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,990
I want him to have fun with me.

584
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,956
Hold on. Hold on. What's that?

585
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,109
-What is that?
-Someone's scared.

586
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,117
-You're making the audience leave.
-They are scared of the truth.

587
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,800
Yes, ma'am? Stand up, please. Go ahead.

588
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,390
Listen, I don't see how you can even walk
out of here with that baby in your hands

589
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,559
without someone stopping you
and taking that baby out of your possession.

590
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,797
All right, well, you know,
there is a finale to this talk show.

591
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,277
Please welcome Shatonya Miggins
from the State Child Services Department.

592
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,039
Take the baby.

593
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,472
What would be the opinion,
the legal opinion of the state,

594
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,957
which is empowered to look after children
and their welfare?

595
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,356
This child is here illegally.

596
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,869
No, it's not. I made a deal with the mother.

597
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,197
And at this time, we're taking the child
into protective custody.

598
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,630
-You are not doing that. You're not taking...
-The child is going...

599
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,191
Get off me. That is my baby.

600
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,874
Give him back! Give me my baby back!

601
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,911
Give me my baby! Give him back!

602
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,314
Come on! Back!

603
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,673
Give me my baby back!

604
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,598
O.J.! Give me my baby! Give me my...

605
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,990
Give me my baby! O.J.!

606
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,874
O.J.!

607
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,474
O.J.! Give me my baby back!

608
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,632
You want some pie today?

609
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,718
Yeah. I haven't had any carbs for 15 years,

610
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,876
since I was, you know, 4 years old.

611
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,911
-Since you was 4?
-Yeah.

612
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,311
Is that your boy? He's pretty.

613
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,476
That was my boy.
He got taken away today.

614
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,910
I'm so sorry. Gosh.
What is he, about 2?

615
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,239
I think he was about, I don't know, 6 or...

616
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,759
-Was he? Was he about that age?
-I don't know.

617
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,031
He could've been a midget.
So he could have been 10.

618
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,711
Good morning, cowboy. What's your name?

619
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,515
Lutz.

620
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,397
Get that out of my face.

621
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,796
Move that out of my... No, Lutz.

622
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,876
Hello? Engineering.

623
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,840
Hello, I apologise for the state of the room.

624
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,191
But can I assure you,
the toilet is absolutely spotless.

625
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,636
Can you look?
The key, I think, is over there, just...

626
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,273
No, I can't do this.

627
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,437
Yeah, Brian, I need you up here
on 20 immediately.

628
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,069
Well, no, it's 2 guys
handcuffed together on a bed.

629
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,749
And there's some contraption
with a dildo on the end of it.

630
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,669
And they're asking...
They've been staying at the hotel for a while

631
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,349
and wanted to know if I can get the key
for them because they can't get out of bed.

632
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,550
I'm pretty freaking flipping right now.

633
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,756
-Come in.
-Can you tell me what's going on?

634
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,792
You were not meant to see this.
You find the key, I can get out of this.

635
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,239
Now, can you just look under that shelf...

636
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,272
No. This is not what was
supposed to be going on in here.

637
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,549
You're telling me, honey.

638
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,514
I should be chained to a 6'4" Norwegian
with a PhD in sucking dick.

639
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,629
That's not my concern.

640
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,235
Okay, well, listen, one other thing.

641
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,319
Can you switch off the television?
Because I made a fart,

642
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,955
and I am on the verge of buying
Mr. Magorium's Wunderbar Emporium.

643
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,593
That's unfortunate.

644
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,951
No, but I refuse to pay
for Mr. Magorium's Wunderbar Emporium.

645
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,559
I did not press it.

646
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,238
No, I'm afraid we are not
gonna be doing that.

647
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,238
Hey, listen, you. What's your name?
Hi. What's your name?

648
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,793
-No, don't even talk to me.
-You're cute.

649
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,195
You're like a Latino Paul Giamatti.

650
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,197
-Hey, don't talk to me. I'm not talking to you.
-Hey, girlfriend.

651
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,875
Also, great. Maybe they can let us out.

652
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,235
Excuse me, can you unlock us? Please.
Hello? Can you unlock us?

653
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,434
Please, can you unlock us?

654
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,074
Please. My assistant's about to shit
on my balls.

655
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,675
What's going on here?

656
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,438
What does it look like, Paul Blart?

657
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,829
Brüno.

658
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,949
Brüno.

659
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,159
Ich was at a low point.
Brüno had hit rock Arsch.

660
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,511
Lutz had gone, und ich had only
9 Freunds left on MeinSpace.

661
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,316
Lutz! Lutz!

662
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,352
I was about to give up
on my dream of celebrity,

663
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,997
when suddenly it hit me.

664
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,237
All the most famous stars in the world,

665
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,708
Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kevin Spacey,
they all had one thing in common.

666
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,437
They were all straight.

667
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,473
To become famous,
I would have to quit guys.

668
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,435
Ich just needed to find
a cock-aholics anonymous.

669
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,594
Things have got to change.
I want to become straight.

670
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,030
-Awesome.
-Once I'm straight,

671
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,071
can I still play the clarinet?

672
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,273
If it doesn't remind you
about some of the behaviour

673
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,119
that you engaged in
when you put your lips around it.

674
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,959
If it doesn't remind you of that,
then I say go for it

675
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,514
and play the clarinet
with everything inside of you.

676
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,872
If it does remind you of that,
then I say put it down,

677
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,198
give it away, let a friend hold it
until you know in your mind

678
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,278
you're ready to pick it up again
and it wouldn't remind you of that.

679
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,110
Und what about if
I put a flute up my stinker?

680
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,151
That... I wouldn't do that either because it
would remind you of the former lifestyle.

681
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,319
So you don't put any woodwind
instruments up your Arschwitz.

682
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,238
-Absolutely not. You know why?
-Why?

683
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,432
Because that would harm my body.
That would hurt...

684
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,790
-Only if you lose the reed.
-Okay.

685
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,758
Well, that would... That would be bad.

686
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,236
Is there any music that I shouldn't listen to?
Any bands?

687
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,199
Sinead O'Connor. The Indigo Girls.

688
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,837
Of course, the Village People.

689
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,872
When I become straight,
you know, a Kuntmeister,

690
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,799
are there any new hobbies
that I should take up?

691
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,230
-Do you enjoy hiking? Lifting weights?
-Sure.

692
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,032
Man, there's nothing like just working out

693
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,277
and lifting weights
and building your muscles

694
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,915
around some other men who are not gay.

695
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,796
I'm totally irresistible to gay guys.
They see me und they want to schtupp me.

696
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,072
-Right.
-So how do I protect against those guys?

697
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,636
If they get close to you,
hit them and leave the situation.

698
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,830
How do you spot the homosexual?

699
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,154
Very hard to do.

700
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,319
Because some of them don't even dress
no different than myself or you.

701
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,079
-Amazing.
-You know?

702
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,270
It's kind of like terrorists.

703
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,950
If a terrorist has infiltrated
a police department

704
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,913
and he dresses like the policemen,
how would you know that's him?

705
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,110
What are obvious things
that we can look for?

706
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,313
Obvious is a person that's being
extremely nice to them to start with.

707
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,912
So if someone approaches you in the street
und is being very, very nice to you,

708
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,712
you know that they are a homosexual?

709
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,114
Most likely.

710
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,355
How should I protect myself
from being attacked by homosexuals?

711
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,553
They probably would attack from behind.

712
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,948
So, again, if I am a homosexual,

713
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,719
and I'm just trying to run in und kiss you...

714
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,192
-Boom! You done moved in the wrong range.
-Right.

715
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,960
Let's say the homosexual
has got you on the ground.

716
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,115
Okay.

717
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,993
Und the homosexual, you know,
has got you down here.

718
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,269
-Right.
-I go to pull this down.

719
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,790
-I want to lock this, lock this leg here.
-Touching.

720
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,399
-Yeah.
-Hit with the elbow.

721
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,953
Boom. As I roll across.

722
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,071
How do you protect yourself from a dildo?

723
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,758
So let's say I'm trying...

724
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,472
Here, you know.

725
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,519
Like that. You know?

726
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,392
Und disarm the dildo?

727
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,509
Yes.

728
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,799
Is it harder to defend against a black dildo?

729
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,273
-No.
-Great.

730
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,676
One is just as easy as the other
to defend against.

731
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,871
-So, I'm attacking.
-Boom.

732
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,440
-Like that.
-Let's say I go down and I...

733
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,793
Trap it, work the knees. Work the elbows.

734
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,154
How do you defend yourself
against the man with 2 dildos?

735
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,714
Coming in. Here. Boom.

736
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,873
Depending on his range. Boom.
Then to his face. Boom.

737
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,354
Okay? Kick around, boom.

738
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,394
He can't do nothing from there.

739
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,273
And if he's just running
with his pants down?

740
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,872
Here. Boom. And then to the eyes.

741
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,998
-Homosexual attacking your bum.
-Leg here.

742
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,829
And then come in and break his arm.
Take it here, take him out.

743
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,872
Break his arms. Boom, break his ribs.
Break his arms.

744
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,639
Okay. Thank you very much. Fantastisch.

745
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,159
-Okay.
-It's very useful.

746
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,556
That's just totally different than
what I've ever tried to, you know, work with.

747
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,152
So you were never gay?

748
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,316
It's ironic that you should have
amazing blow job lips.

749
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,551
Well, these lips were made to praise Jesus.

750
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,511
No, they were made for something else,
but you're just not using it for them.

751
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,834
Well...

752
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,076
Are there any activities you suggest

753
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,794
where I'll be surrounded
just by straight guys?

754
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,195
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Let's go! Let's go!

755
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,598
-Push ups! Sit ups!
-Push ups! Sit ups!

756
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,916
-Hurry up. Get in here.
-Was?

757
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,674
Make this bed. Hurry up. Make the bed.

758
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,472
But do you have something,
maybe a double...

759
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,749
Make the bed!

760
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,553
Could you hold the sheet over there?

761
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,635
I'm not holding anything.

762
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,954
-Get down. Get down.
-Was?

763
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,196
I said, get down! Do push ups.

764
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,039
This line right here is
a line that you don't cross.

765
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,515
This is TAC Alley. TAC Officer's...

766
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,756
You're in it again. This is my alley.

767
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,995
I don't want to be in your alley.

768
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,192
Yeah, well, get out of it.
Your finger's in my alley.

769
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,869
Not yet.

770
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,473
By the way, where's your uniform?
Go get your uniform on.

771
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,669
Do it!

772
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,033
Oh, my gosh.

773
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,509
What's up with the scarf?

774
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,115
That is, like, it's my own thing.

775
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,515
Let me introduce you to somebody.
Captain Miles.

776
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,232
Candidate, what are you doing?

777
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,918
Stand at the position of attention, candidate.

778
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,429
-Do it! Do it!
-Head and eyes straight forward, candidate.

779
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,915
Head and eyes straight forward.
Stand still, candidate.

780
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,155
That is not part of the uniform, candidate.
You need to take that off.

781
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,195
This outfit is too matchy-matchy as it is,

782
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,995
and so I was just trying to break it up
with some simple horizontal lines.

783
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,793
Do you have an attitude, candidate?
Do we detect an attitude?

784
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,310
-Sir, she's got an attitude.
-What?

785
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,749
Sir Officer Candidate,
did you just call me "she"?

786
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,791
-Get down, candidate! Now!
-Do it!

787
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,956
What type belt is that, candidate?

788
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,274
What is that?

789
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,152
-D&G.
-What is D&G?

790
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,157
Dolce und Gabbana. Hello?

791
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,269
-"Hello"?
-"Hello"?

792
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,799
-Front in the rest position.
-Get down, you!

793
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,868
Sir Officer Candidate,
you deserve a medal for exceptional skin.

794
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,755
What are you talking...
What are you trying to say, candidate?

795
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,510
Sir Officer Candidate, you could be a general
in the Bitch Army the way you're going.

796
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,278
-Did you use profanity again?
-Did you use profanity?

797
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,549
But you're being really nasty.

798
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,275
The OC guide states that I will not
use profanity while I'm at OCS.

799
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,960
Yes, mein Führer. Yes, Officer Candidate.

800
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,196
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up! Let's go!

801
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,473
-Yeah, this is mine.
-You better help your buddy.

802
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,071
Get out of my TAC Alley.

803
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,155
Get out of my TAC Alley.

804
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,555
-Hurry up! Hurry up!
-Move over there!

805
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,913
-Salute!
-Salute with your right hand.

806
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,029
Salute with your right hand.

807
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,832
-That's not a salute.
-That's not a salute.

808
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,915
That's not a salute.

809
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,472
Can I tell you about the person
that changed my life?

810
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,397
Was it Karl Lagerfeld?

811
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,832
No, actually, his name is Jesus.
Jesus is in this room right now.

812
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,077
He never leaves us. He never forsakes us.
He's here.

813
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,509
Amazing.

814
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,119
That's exactly right. He's amazing.

815
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,755
You want to be famous.
You'll be one that's so famous, Brüno,

816
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,316
you will prepare the way
for other young men all over the world

817
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,194
who want to come out of the homosexual
lifestyle and make a change in their lives.

818
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,039
And they'll say, "If Brüno can do it,
then I can do it.

819
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,230
"How did he change?
How did you change, Brüno?"

820
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,033
And they'll say, "It's Jesus. He changed me."

821
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,116
But he wants to come into
your heart right now.

822
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,435
Are you ready to make that change?

823
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,400
Are you hitting on me?

824
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,719
No, I'm not.

825
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,837
Okay, good, 'cause I just...
That was, like, really hot, that whole speech.

826
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,351
Are there any outdoor activities

827
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,677
that I should do
if I want to become straight?

828
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,239
Absolutely.

829
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,154
-Hi.
-Hello.

830
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,879
-Mike. Brüno.
-Brüno.

831
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,315
Hey. Great.

832
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,998
-I'm Donny.
-Brüno.

833
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,035
Robert.

834
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,430
-You ever been hunting?
-I've never killed an animal.

835
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,589
Although, I did once
suffocate a hamster in Mykonos.

836
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,749
The women, eh? Do you prefer the vagina
or the mammary glands?

837
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,070
-I prefer the vagina.
-Me, too.

838
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,630
I love a woman with a vagina.

839
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,749
Yeah.

840
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,509
My favourite.

841
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,278
Didn't see anything.

842
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,475
We were just talking about vaginas.

843
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,595
About what?

844
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,551
Vaginas. The woman's vagina.

845
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,750
Sharing stories
and saying how much we enjoy them.

846
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,995
Yes.

847
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,912
Really fantastisch.

848
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,271
Really wonderful things.

849
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,873
It's my favourite.

850
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,958
This is wonderful.

851
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,791
This is what rabbit look like.

852
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,353
Look at the 4 of us.
We are so like the Sex and the City girls.

853
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,351
No, we aren't, either.

854
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,078
Which one are you, Donny?

855
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,555
I ain't any one of them. I'm Donny.

856
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,228
That is such a Samantha thing to say.

857
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,232
I've never been
out of the city before.

858
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,158
You haven't? How's it feel?

859
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,597
I feel a bit vulnerable.

860
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,910
You know, I'm 19 years old,
I've got a perfect body.

861
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,316
You know, I really don't want to wake up
tomorrow morning und find

862
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,750
that I'm torn in my Arschenholer.

863
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,830
You probably ain't the only one.

864
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,032
Me, either, definitely.

865
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,994
There's so many stars in the sky.

866
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,319
Full of them.

867
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,472
Makes you think of
all the hot guys in the world.

868
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,508
Do we all share one tent
or what's more sensible?

869
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,868
I hope not.

870
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,032
All right, God damn it.

871
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,760
Reverend BJ found me
too much of a handful

872
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,711
and put me in touch with one of his chums.

873
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,558
You look decent in that.

874
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,993
Look like a straight guy, how's that?

875
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,432
Women are good for us.

876
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,474
They're good even though

877
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,910
they appear to us
to be terribly conventional.

878
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,155
And we find that somewhat irritating

879
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,389
that they complain so much.

880
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,157
-Right.
-But we need that.

881
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,996
We need many of the things

882
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,992
that, at first glance,
are annoying and irritating.

883
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,197
And women often don't stick to the point.

884
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,757
They're often talking about one thing
and then another and then another,

885
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,829
and they never get back to the first point
maybe ever.

886
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,916
I am repulsed by the idea
of making the sex with a woman.

887
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,836
The important thing is to be around women,

888
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,192
somewhat, that you find tolerable
or interesting

889
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,638
and give them a chance to seduce you.

890
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,833
How did you get into it?

891
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,949
We, actually, our first time was on our...

892
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,838
-Our honeymoon.
-Yeah.

893
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,959
Of all nights for us to swing,
the first time was for our honeymoon.

894
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,995
Und what is your favourite position?

895
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,838
That would be missionary or reverse cowgirl.

896
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,351
What's reverse cowgirl?

897
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,553
Show me. I'll pretend to be the woman.

898
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,635
Like, I'm sitting here, and...

899
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,275
Yeah, and so, if I'm the woman...
Don't worry. Yeah, so what?

900
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,435
You'd be sitting like that,

901
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,790
-and that's called reverse cowgirl.
-Right. Right.

902
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,593
And then when you're facing me,
that's called cowgirl.

903
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,954
This one here is cowgirl or reverse cowgirl?

904
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,149
This is cowgirl.

905
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,840
And then when you're turned
the opposite way, it's reverse cowgirl.

906
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,953
Und what other positions are there?

907
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,196
-Power driver.
-Right.

908
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,435
69.

909
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,039
But this is the girl's position.

910
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,599
You don't want to be like this
if you're a guy.

911
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,597
There's missionary, doggy style.

912
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,869
So what's doggy style like?

913
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,389
You'd be bent over, like a dog does it.

914
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,794
Yeah. Like that?

915
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,831
All right, and then
what would you be doing?

916
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,393
If you was a woman,
I would be humping you.

917
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,158
-No, show me.
-I'm not gonna show you.

918
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,554
-You're a man.
-Don't be a faggot.

919
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,114
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just a couple of guys.

920
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,316
I'd be humping you like that.

921
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:48,151
I can't wait to do this to a woman.

922
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,908
Anybody want a sandwich or something?

923
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,350
Yeah. Great.

924
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,792
Very good. You've got great hair actually.

925
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,592
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

926
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,594
That was great.

927
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,194
-Oh, yeah.
-Good boy.

928
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,788
Fuck, yeah.

929
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,198
You're doing a great job.

930
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,514
Thank you.

931
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,875
Come on, Jack, look me in the eyes.

932
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,195
Look me in the eye. You can do this.

933
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,315
Dude.

934
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,317
Why would he look you in the eyes
when he's looking at a pussy?

935
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,352
-Why would he look you in the eyes?
-No, no. Just for concentration.

936
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,358
-He does not look in a guy's...
-I don't need you for concentration, okay?

937
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,948
-Look her in the eye.
-This is a fucking swingers party. Okay?

938
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,718
If you don't want pussy,
if you don't want fucking...

939
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,717
-No, I want...
-Then quit fucking touching me

940
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,559
and quit telling me
to look at you in the eye. Okay?

941
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,240
I didn't come here
for no fucking queer shit. Okay?

942
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,759
-Me, neither.
-Okay.

943
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,233
-Let's keep it at that then.
-Cool.

944
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,158
This is a fucking swingers party.
Right, guys?

945
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,271
I see what the fuck you're doing, dude.

946
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,469
-Hi.
-Did he not try to pull

947
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,158
-that queer shit on you out there?
-Hi. How you doing?

948
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,430
I don't need this motherfucker
touching me on the back,

949
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,516
telling me to look him
in the fucking eye. Right?

950
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,950
-I was just going to the kitchen.
-I know, yeah. Come on.

951
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,638
What's this shit? Let's take this off.

952
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,239
Let's maybe we get
to know each other a little.

953
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,874
-I think you broke that, actually.
-I don't give a fuck.

954
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,549
Yeah, there is...
Let's get to know each other a little bit first.

955
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,835
Know each other? What?

956
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,110
You must produce a lot of milk.

957
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,749
I don't want you to do something
that you'll regret.

958
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,190
You wake up tomorrow, you've lost
your virginity, and you feel ashamed.

959
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,471
You know, let's take this a little slower.

960
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,556
-We should reschedule.
-Sit the fuck down.

961
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,830
Sit the fuck down. Don't fuck around!

962
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,830
No, let's do this the right way.

963
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,669
I go, and I sit down with your father,
we talk about this.

964
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,153
-If he gives his permission...
-What?

965
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,554
Would you quit being a little bitch here

966
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,399
and take your little briefs off
before I fucking rip them?

967
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,039
Wait. Yes.

968
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,149
-Yeah.
-Fine.

969
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,269
-Thanks.
-Okay. Great.

970
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,197
I don't like this little shit.

971
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,469
Yes, well, I want to really make
this heterosexual sex.

972
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,389
It's going to be fantastisch!

973
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,274
Do as I say. Take that fucking shit off now!

974
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,675
-Don't... You fold them.
-Fuck.

975
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,439
You gotta fold that neatly.
You don't treat suede like that. It stains.

976
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,835
Sit the fuck down. Take it off!

977
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,270
I've got an idea.
Let's play a little bit of dress-up here.

978
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,355
It will be erotisch.

979
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,232
What is this?
You gonna dress me like a man?

980
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,679
No, it's just a beard.

981
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,233
-Am I supposed to wear a beard?
-It's just a...

982
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,634
Come on, it will be fun.

983
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,875
I don't need a beard.

984
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,319
Take it off! Now!

985
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,589
Once you put the...

986
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,435
-Fuck! Take it off.
-Okay. I'm...

987
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,595
-Okay, I'm going to do this.
-Right now!

988
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,280
Get on your fucking knees
and suck my spike here, bitch.

989
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,831
Okay. Help!

990
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,752
Don't fuck around!

991
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,512
Don't call me gay!

992
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,874
I'm gonna become straight.
I'm gonna become über straight.

993
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,713
I'm gonna be the straightest man
who's ever lived.

994
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,628
Und then I'll be famous.
You'll see. You'll see.

995
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,549
What's up, Arkansas?
How's everybody doing?

996
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,590
You guys ready to see
a little ass kicking tonight?

997
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,477
Make some noise, everybody.
Put your hands together. Make some noise

998
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,469
for the host of the brand-new TV show,
Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout.

999
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,633
Give it up for Straight Dave!

1000
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,589
Straight Dave. Straight Dave.

1001
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,317
Are you ready for
some man-slamming action?

1002
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,230
Who's ready for
an old-fashioned heterofest?

1003
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,599
Are you 100% hetero like me?

1004
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,188
Who out there is proud to be straight?

1005
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,993
Let me hear you say straight pride.

1006
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,468
-Straight pride.
-Straight pride.

1007
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,158
Straight pride.

1008
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,599
-Straight pride.
-Straight pride.

1009
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,549
I am so straight
that when I bought my house,

1010
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,956
the first thing I did
was brick up the back door.

1011
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:15,119
You know why?
Because my asshole's just for shitting.

1012
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,719
Let me hear you say that.

1013
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,990
-My asshole's just for shitting.
-My asshole's just for shitting.

1014
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,117
It's great to have an evening
with straight people.

1015
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,913
It's great not to have any fags here.

1016
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,553
You're a faggot!

1017
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,471
Who called me a faggot?

1018
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,788
Whoever called me a faggot come up here,
and I'll beat your Arsch.

1019
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,198
Who called Straight Dave a faggot?
Come up here.

1020
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,119
Let him in.

1021
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,790
Who wants to see me beat this fag's ass?

1022
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,955
Who wants me to beat this...

1023
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,155
Fuck him up!

1024
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,508
Get him, motherfucker!

1025
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,431
Beat his fucking ass!

1026
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,953
Kick his ass!

1027
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,639
Fucking fag!

1028
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,270
-Homo! Queer fags!
-Motherfuckers!

1029
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,511
Stop! Stop!

1030
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,590
Get out of my town. You all are sick.

1031
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,634
Tell him we don't have no faggots here
in Arkansas. Take that shit somewhere else.

1032
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,788
You pussy-ass faggot motherfucker!

1033
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,716
Fuck that shit! Fuck that shit!

1034
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,391
Fuck that shit! Fuck that shit!

1035
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,673
The footage went everywhere,
und Brüno became über famous.

1036
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,948
As for Lutz,
we decided to get married in California.

1037
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,117
But because of the law,
we had to be a bit inventive.

1038
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,836
I feel this is the biggest step
you'll ever make in your lifetime.

1039
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,678
-It's a very big moment.
-That's right.

1040
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,758
Am I going to be able to meet her
before we actually start?

1041
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,869
Sure.

1042
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,431
I... I don't marry 2 men or 2 women.

1043
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,956
If she's a man,
then how did it give birth to our son?

1044
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,269
You gave birth to a little black child?

1045
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,389
Yes.

1046
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,436
When did you have the baby?

1047
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,758
I don't even know why
I'm asking that question.

1048
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,075
But even though marriage
was a nicht-nicht,

1049
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,395
we weren't gonna let it get us down.

1050
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,555
We were happy. We had each other.

1051
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,548
And we had O.J. back,

1052
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,680
although he did cost us a MacBook Pro.

1053
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,749
Plus, ich was now so famous

1054
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,839
that I was able to record
mein very own charity video.

1055
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:53,519
Subtitles: Arigon

1056
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,072
I've written a song

1057
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,116
that I hope is gonna
bring the world together

1058
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,236
Put down your guns and bombs

1059
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,038
and just make love forever

1060
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,834
Okay, then.

1061
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,758
He's come to heal the world

1062
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,910
and make all nations calmer

1063
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,955
I am the Austrian Jesus

1064
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,597
He is the white Obama

1065
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,798
He's the white Obama

1066
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,118
War's just based on hate and fear

1067
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,357
Stop fighting, North and South Korea

1068
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,038
You're both basically Chinese

1069
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,709
And he's Brüno, dove of peace

1070
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,513
Hey, yo, Brüno, where the bitches at?

1071
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,874
You are Brüno, dove of peace

1072
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,231
You do it, fashion model
You got the cute hos

1073
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,229
You are Brüno, dove of peace

1074
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,072
You know, I love black guys.
I'm a chocoholic.

1075
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,192
Du bist Brüno, dove of peace

1076
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,878
Brüno wants peace.

1077
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,789
Either we gonna have peace,
or we gonna have motherfucking war.

1078
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,278
I have a dream for the Third World

1079
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,310
Clean water, food and teaching

1080
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,230
In every village and every town

1081
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,918
a place for anal bleaching

1082
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,030
We need to rid the world of hunger

1083
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,311
I'm like Bono, except much younger

1084
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,718
He's only 19

1085
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,479
Ich bin Brüno, dove of peace

1086
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,592
Hey, hey, he gay, he gay

1087
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,549
Okay.
