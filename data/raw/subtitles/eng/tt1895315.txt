1
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,593
<i>As life progresses...
images blur.</i>

2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,167
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>Some of them true...</i>

4
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,506
<i>- some of them false.</i>

5
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,515
<i>I remember her well.</i>

6
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,511
<i>At least I think I do.</i>

7
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,121
<i>She was a warrior.</i>

8
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,618
<i>In the old century,
you had to be...</i>

9
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,753
<i>in order to survive.</i>

10
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,851
Breathe in and out,
the way she does.

11
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,958
And now push. Now!

12
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,875
- Thank you so much.

13
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,882
- Bye.

14
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,877
- See you in a couple of days,
right'?

15
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,499
Mama?

16
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,271
Are you coming?

17
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,320
- Good morning!
- 'Morning, Liz!

18
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,419
Here, Ma.

19
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,291
- Liz, the boy's gotta learn
how to shoot.

20
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,457
- Well, he's gonna do it anyway.

21
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,263
Better here than sneaking off
somewhere else.

22
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,803
You're scaring your mother.
- She ain't my mother.

23
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,566
- Beware of false prophets...

24
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,343
who come to you
in sheep's clothing...

25
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,342
for inwardly,
they are ravening wolves.

26
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:45,081
Jesus is the shepherd who protects you
and your family from those wolves.

27
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,520
And I am his dog.

28
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,356
The sheepdog that gets the lambs back
on track when they stray off the path.

29
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,203
And some of you have strayed...
haven't you'?

30
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,441
What do you people think?

31
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,376
That God is well-disposed towards you?

32
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
Let me set things straight.

33
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,782
Those who deserve it go to Hell.

34
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,414
I could tell you about Hell.

35
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,223
About its flames.

36
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,952
About the pain.

37
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,898
I'm sure you people
have tried to imagine what it's like.

38
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,129
It's worse.

39
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,974
Retribution is coming.

40
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,810
Now... let us join in singing.

41
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,049
Abide With Me.

42
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,256
<i>♪ Abide with me</i> ♪

43
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,158
<i>♪ Fast falls the eventide</i> ♪

44
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:03,833
♪ <i>The darkness deepens</i> ♪

45
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,564
<i>♪ Lord with me abide</i> ♪

46
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,332
You alright?

47
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,772
- Thank you.

48
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,598
- How're you doing, sir?
This is my daughter, Sam.

49
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,700
My boy, Matthew. And, uh...

50
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,010
my wife.

51
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,148
Where were you?

52
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,786
That man's a stranger here.

53
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,556
He doesn't know anybody yet.

54
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,564
I'd have expected
a little more compassion from you.

55
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,032
What's wrong'? What's wrong?

56
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,967
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong'?

57
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,381
- Just breathe, alright? Breathe,
just breathe.

58
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,586
Everybody outside.
We don't need no busybodies.

59
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,822
Go on, get. Get out!

60
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,229
It's gonna be alright.

61
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,598
- Nathan,
I think you better go outside too.

62
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,934
Some things aren't meant
for a man's eyes.

63
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,540
It's gonna be just fine, right, Liz?

64
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,938
- You're gonna take care of her, right?
Promise?

65
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,545
I'm going to be right outside, OK?
I love you. I love you.

66
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,955
You take care of her.

67
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,954
- Close the door behind you.

68
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,583
It's gonna be alright, honey.

69
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,064
- The baby's head's too big.

70
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,303
- What's that supposed to say?

71
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,467
- We're going to have to choose
between the baby and the mother.

72
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,306
Can't save both of them.

73
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,471
You have to.

74
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,106
Your mother said
everything would be bleating...

75
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,254
- No, I wanna stay. I wanna help.

76
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,829
- Hey... how's it going in there?

77
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,038
Everything alright?

78
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,034
Yeah?

79
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,497
- Push, Abby.
Hard as you can now. Come on!

80
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,516
Good girl!

81
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,190
- Where's the baby?

82
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,091
I wanna see my baby.
Where is he?

83
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,887
Give me my baby!

84
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,918
- It ain't your fault.

85
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,396
The Lord gives...
and the Lord takes away.

86
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,603
- The Reverend?

87
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,779
Liz...

88
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,178
The Reverend is a man of God.

89
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,616
You're seeing things that ain't there.

90
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,646
- <i>If Jesus came back to life
after he was dead...</i>

91
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,441
couldn't that happen
to Abigail's baby too'?

92
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,986
Can you face-paint me?

93
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,263
- I'm doing something.
Can't you tell?

94
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,129
- We've come to see
if everything's alright.

95
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,763
- Everything's just fine.

96
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,103
No reason for you folks
to go wasting your time.

97
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,971
- We'd like to look for ourselves.

98
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,605
- Rather not.
There's a doctor coming in an hour.

99
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,979
It's better if he takes a look.

100
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,890
The Reverend arranged it.

101
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,766
- Hello!

102
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,610
- What the hell?
- Liz!!

103
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,177
Liz!!

104
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,815
You get down here, Liz!

105
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,985
You get down here!

106
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,387
I wanna see your face.

107
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,827
I wanna see... your face.

108
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,213
Nathan!!
Don't take it out on my boy!!

109
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,151
We can talk about this
like decent folk!!

110
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,195
- I got no quarrel with you, Eli!

111
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,694
I'm here for your wife!

112
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,428
She's gotta be punished for her sins.

113
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,529
She's gotta burn at the stake, Eli!

114
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,163
- Try to be reasonable now, Nathan!

115
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,107
I know your sorrow, believe me.

116
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,769
I lost a loved one too, remember'?!

117
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,545
I know you're out of your mind
with grief,

118
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:23,120
but believe me, your pain will <i>pass,</i>
just like mine did!

119
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,449
- I could accept that real easy...

120
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,257
as long as that tongueless murderess
ends up at the stake!

121
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,462
I demand retribution!

122
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,065
You know what she did, Eli?

123
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,765
She murdered my baby boy.

124
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,274
Before he could even be baptized,
she murdered him.

125
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,611
What's gonna happen to him now?

126
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,491
You think he's gonna find salvation?

127
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,927
You know how she did it, Eli?

128
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,095
I seen him.

129
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,298
His brains had leaked out.

130
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
Your wife broke his skull.

131
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,812
She cracked his skull wide open!

132
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,117
She should go to hell for this!

133
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,318
- That will be enough.

134
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,757
There has been suffering.

135
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,792
It is the whiskey talking now.

136
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,464
This is not the moment to solve this.

137
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,336
- She belongs in hell, Reverend.

138
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,798
- He do you any harm?

139
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,180
He just helped us out of a real fix.

140
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,277
- Do I get one too?

141
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,511
- You ain't old enough for that yet.

142
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,451
- Why be so hard on the boy?

143
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,524
He only acted to protect his family.

144
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,286
That makes him an adult.

145
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,861
- His mother doesn't want him
playing with guns.

146
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,956
- It's natural for a young man
to want to hold a rifle in his hands.

147
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,234
May I offer my glass to Matthew?

148
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,554
- I think it's about time
you went back to bed, Matthew.

149
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,089
- Aw, Dad!
- Come on, drink up.

150
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,634
- None of this would've happened if that
baby had been born in perfect health.

151
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,148
- But Liz couldn't do nothing about that.

152
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,152
- She decided who was to live
and who was to die.

153
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,689
That decision belongs to God
and God only.

154
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,924
Why did she not leave
that choice up to Him?

155
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,924
- Maybe I should go fetch her.

156
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,147
- I know you're there,
and I know you can hear me.

157
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:27,183
You may have no tongue,
but there is nothing wrong with your ears.

158
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,560
Why do doubts rise in your heart?

159
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,933
Why are you troubled?

160
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,402
How do you sleep at night?

161
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,713
How does it feel to be a murderess?

162
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,887
Do you know why I'm here?

163
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,220
I'm hereto punish you.

164
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,100
Do you love this family?

165
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,601
I've looked at your daughter.

166
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,411
She's almost a young woman already.

167
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,718
- There you are.

168
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,779
- I must be going.

169
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:37,255
Please don't bear a grudge
against Nathan in your heart-.

170
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,564
Losing a child is the worst thing
a body can go through.

171
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,830
I was just talking to your wife
about that same thing.

172
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,327
- You didn't even thank him.

173
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,496
Fact is,
you didn't even say hello to him.

174
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:28,106
- Oh, Liz, Nathan will come around.

175
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,315
Right. You know what?

176
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,356
Give me a couple of days.

177
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,893
I'll get somebody to come in
for the sheep.

178
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,325
And then we'll go up
to my pa's for a bit.

179
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,329
He's all alone up there anyway.

180
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,064
- Dad'?!

181
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,873
Dad!

182
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,013
- I'm just going to talk.
This has got to stop.

183
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,484
First shootin' our windows up,
now this.

184
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,249
Yah! Come on!

185
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,316
Yah! Yah!

186
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,691
I want you to stay
with your mother!

187
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,495
- She ain't my mother.
- Matthew!

188
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,626
- You're gonna need my help.

189
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,836
- Alright,
as long as you stay outside.

190
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,036
- But why can't I just play inside?

191
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,847
- Why?

192
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,053
- And why can't I help out?

- I think we can take
that blindfold off now.

208
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,235
- But I promised.

209
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,737
- Your mother won't mind.
She has a lot to do.

210
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,734
Here, see?

211
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,144
Everything will be fine.

212
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,716
- And Mama?

213
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:05,049
- She had to work in the barn.

214
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,590
And she did not want you there.
Do you remember?

215
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,960
I would like to talk to you
about your mother.

216
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,654
- Nathan?

217
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,235
- They've gone and moved.

218
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,915
Liz?

219
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,681
Where are you?

220
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,730
No, no, Nathan's gone.
And Abigail.

221
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,930
Packed up, moved out.

222
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,588
Whoa. Where'd you get to, huh?

223
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,957
You scared your mother.

224
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,429
Had her worried sick.

225
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,659
- Mama, are you evil?

226
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,131
The Reverend said
you murdered a man.

227
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,270
He says he's hereto punish you.

228
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,937
To take you back
where he came from.

229
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,883
Why?

230
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,650
- Because she loves you.

231
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,325
- Shoot me.

232
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,295
Behind you.

233
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,981
Please.

234
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,080
Stop the pain.

235
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,034
Take them to Grandpa.

236
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,453
Mama?

237
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,455
Mama?

238
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,664
It was the Reverend.
He woke me up.

239
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,304
Yah! Yah!

240
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,272
- Joanna. My name is Joanna.

241
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,348
- Frank!

242
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,683
Frank!

243
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,051
- Meng!

244
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,012
Meng, you prosperous fucker, you.
Look at you.

245
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,951
And what do we have here?

246
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:17,557
- My name's Joanna.
- Well, it is a pleasure to meet you.

247
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:21,357
Come on now, spin around,
let me get a look at you.

248
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,859
There you are.

249
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:25,798
Sally!
- Yeah.

250
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,961
- Would you be so kind
as to treat Joanna here

251
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,039
to a glass of cold lemonade?

252
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,734
- Yeah, but of course.
Come, honey.

253
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,074
- Alright, Meng,
let's talk fucking turkey.

254
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,579
- Here you go.

255
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,459
- Lookie here! Fresh meat.
- Swallow it right on down, girlie.

256
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,089
Soon you'll be swallowing something else.

257
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,895
- What's your name, girl?

258
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,299
- Joanna.

259
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,427
- Did your daddy bring you here?

260
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,975
No? You sure?

261
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,838
Didn't he just think
you were so good,

262
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,912
he had to let the rest
of the world in on it too?

263
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,154
- Hey. Whoa, there now,
where do you think you're going?

264
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,664
- They're leaving without me!

265
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,927
- Yes, they are,
but don't you worry about a thing,

266
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:36,130
'cause from now on,
this is where you live, darling.

267
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,262
Right here.

268
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,679
Now, come on now.
Let's get you cleaned up.

269
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,850
- Shhh, shhh!

270
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,599
- Yeah, yeah!

271
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,199
- So that's the work we do around here.

272
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,936
And we do all the moaning and groaning
because that makes sure it's over faster.

273
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,741
- Why?
- Why? That's what men like.

274
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,683
So, uh... you ever bled yet?

275
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,916
'Twixt your legs, honey.

276
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,291
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You have, haven't you?

277
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,192
Yeah'? Well, then,

278
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,395
that's gonna be our little secret
for the time being. OK'?

279
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,297
Now, you go to bed.

280
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,427
- Ah!

281
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,936
- And who are you?

282
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,140
What's your name, girl?

283
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,777
- Joanna.

284
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,015
- Frank, what's it cost
to go upstairs with this one?

285
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,649
- Come on now, Fred,
you cannot afford her.

286
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,457
- Oh, I don't know about that.
I got pretty damn lucky at cards today.

287
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:16,963
- Hey, Eastman!

288
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,632
I'm horny as hell
and I feel like doing you!

289
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,034
What would you say to a free ride, huh?

290
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,936
- That ain't yours to decide.
- I'll pay for it myself.

291
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,170
- Damn Sally, what,
you been holding out on me now, huh?

292
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,645
- <i>I'll</i> go along with that.
But then she gets to watch.

293
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,649
- No way.
- Then it's no deal.

294
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,617
- Oh, it sounds like a fine idea to me.

295
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,046
It'll be most educational, I'm sure.

296
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,705
- What's wrong,
don't you like it, honeybunch?

297
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,005
Oh, yeah.

298
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:09,874
Hit me.

299
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,009
- What?
- Hit me!

300
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,582
- No, I ain't gonna do that.
- Hit me, goddammit!

301
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,252
- Ah! I'm not taking this, Eastman.

302
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,828
- Hit me again.

303
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,598
Hit me again!

304
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,569
- No, no, no, no, don't shoot!

305
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,701
Don't shoot.
I don't mind it, Joanna.

306
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,041
It's just a game, right'? Oh!

307
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,246
- You do that again
and I'm going to shoot.

308
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,878
- Please put the gun down.
- Don't you ever.

309
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,423
Just keep pointing it at me.

310
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,027
Don't you dare drop that gun on me.

311
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,088
- Ah!

312
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,427
- That's right. Keep pointing it at me.

313
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,865
Don't you dare...

314
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:09,066
I'm gonna strangle the life out of her!

315
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,580
Shoot me!

316
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,246
Do it, Joanna.
Shoot me, goddammit!

317
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,559
Shoot, goddammit, bitch!

318
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,948
You're gonna make a fine little whore,
I can see that already.

319
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,588
I just bet that you can make me
real nice and clean too.

320
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,806
- The whole world
may see our fair city of Bismuth

321
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:16,639
as a place of Sodom and Gomorrah.

322
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,447
But rules do apply here.

323
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:24,880
A whore cannot be allowed
to shoot down her customers with impunity.

324
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:30,014
My brother runs The Inferno
as a place where hardworking miners

325
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,286
can find well-deserved recreation.

326
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,829
That must remain so,

327
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:36,659
and so it will.

328
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,975
Let this be an example.

329
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,684
No.

330
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:23,042
- Come on now,

331
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:26,842
a mining town has a need
for organized entertainment.

332
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,918
And I need to know
that customers here feel safe.

333
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,024
That's why I brought
my brother Zeke to Bismuth.

334
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,116
He's a better sheriff
than this town deserves.

335
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:44,926
Everybody at The Inferno knows that if a
girl so much <i>as</i> scratches a customer,

336
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,864
she's gonna be punished.

337
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,030
So Sally knew what she had coming.

338
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,197
- But he strangled her.

339
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:58,239
- Yeah, I know. It hurt me too.

340
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,815
Damn, she was one of my oldest employees.

341
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,213
But rules are rules.

342
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:10,258
If you don't obey the rules, you're guilty.
And if you're guilty, you're gonna pay.

343
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,456
You understand that, don't you? Hmm?

344
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,429
Tell me you understand.

345
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,679
You know how old I was
when I first went to bed with a girl?

346
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,644
I was 21.

347
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:41,655
Twenty-one.

348
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,792
While Zeke, he was 14.

349
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,954
I got to watch, though.

350
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,861
I spied on him through the peephole.

351
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,497
I never did see
what all the fuss was about.

352
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:01,470
You know, what everybody talked about.

353
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,475
I couldn't see it.

354
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,873
You're not a child anymore.

355
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,153
- I haven't been for a long time.

356
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,131
- The time has come.

357
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,507
I'm gonna be gentle.

358
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:00,063
- That's right.

359
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,194
Oh, stud, you sure are good.

360
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,431
- Joanna!

361
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,199
Joanna!

362
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,037
Frank is in a gunfight!

363
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,509
- Hey, what the hell?!
I'm almost done.

364
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,076
- You see that?

365
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,711
What do you say
we have her join us next time?

366
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:38,963
- This is just between me and Frank.

367
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,468
All I want is a fair fight.

368
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,637
- Then what are you doing here?!

369
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,613
- Blow him to hell!
- Yeah!

370
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,650
- I'm not a violent man.

371
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,380
I usually work with numbers.

372
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,651
But now I'm standing here
in front of you...

373
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,783
to shoot you dead, Frank.

374
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:03,664
My daughter is dead because of you.

375
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,661
It's men like you who think
their actions have no consequences,

376
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:12,831
who are making the country
turn into what it's turning into.

377
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,245
So for my daughter's sake...

378
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,014
for every daughter's sake...

379
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,475
I have to kill you.

380
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,609
Because I'm a father.

381
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:29,087
- So you can count.

382
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,293
And you can sure as shit talk.

383
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,290
But what we all wanna know is,

384
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,421
can you shoot?

385
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,886
- So when do we elope?

386
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,886
- Where to?

387
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,723
- Anywhere.

388
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,300
Wherever we can be free.

389
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,468
- But we are free here. Sort of.

390
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,369
- No, we're not.

391
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,499
And you know it.

392
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:27,142
Face-paint me.

393
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,145
- What?

394
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:33,011
- Paint my face with your fingers.

395
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,364
- You, uh, you remind me of my wife.

396
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,375
But you dress better,
you smell better, you look better.

397
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,340
- Thank you.

398
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,248
- No fucking kissing.

399
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,949
I said, no kissing!

400
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,024
No kissing! Goddammit!

401
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,930
- So you gonna buy me that drink, or what?
- Sure. Whiskey.

402
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:34,047
- I warned you, you sonofabitch!
Nobody kisses me! Do you understand'?!

403
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,310
- Fucking whore,
you bit my tongue off!

404
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,284
Frank?! Frank'?!

405
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,855
Oh, girl, you really
gone and done it now.

406
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,472
I warned him six times!

407
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,254
- Well, the fella you warned
is kind of important

408
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:48,385
up at the gold mine.

409
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,630
Now, I got me a whole saloon

410
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,292
full of drunken fucking idiots
all howling for retribution!

411
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,504
- Tell 'em to go fuck themselves. Give
them a drink on the house or something.

412
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,802
- You think I'm gonna waste
my hard-earned money

413
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,274
because you girls refuse
to obey the fucking rules'?!

414
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:04,401
Get the fuck up! Come on!

415
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,779
Get out there!
- Fuck you!

416
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,441
Now where's Mike?!

417
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:13,486
- I demand retribution!

418
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,954
- You're gonna get it, Mike!

419
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,423
You see, the rules in Bismuth are clear,

420
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,689
and all customers will get
the respect they got coming!

421
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,094
- Hang the stupid whore!

422
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,100
- No, no, Elizabeth here,
she's not gonna hang.

423
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,999
Gotta hang her, Frank!

424
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,299
- Mike ain't dead neither, is he?

425
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:34,875
But he was a victim of her lawlessness,

426
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,309
so he gets to make a fucking proposal.

427
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,642
Now what's it gonna be, Mike? Huh?

428
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,115
You want this free pussy for a week?
Is that it?

429
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,479
- You cut that fucking bitch's tongue off!

430
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,630
- You want a trade, Mike, huh?

431
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:00,861
You want an eye for an eye?
Is that what you want'?

432
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,046
- Rinse it five times a day with alcohol

433
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,553
and it should heal up
sooner than you'd think.

434
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,987
No solid foods. No blow jobs.

435
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,355
- Will she ever be able to talk again?

436
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:27,155
- Not much chance of that.

437
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,854
Here you go.

438
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,692
Goodbye.

439
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,866
- I...

440
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,072
dance...

441
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,741
on Tuesday?

442
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,279
I... only drink...

443
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:49,180
on Tuesdays.

444
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,274
I only drink on Tuesdays.

445
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:55,884
I...

446
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,257
kill...

447
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:01,894
Frank?

448
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,793
That's suicide.

449
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:10,402
But they'll come after you.

450
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,269
Besides, what're you gonna do?
Work in some other cathouse?

451
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,943
Please don't do it.

452
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,714
I couldn't stand to miss you.

453
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,455
God sees each and every one of you.

454
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:37,588
Don't think just because this is a lawless,
godless place

455
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:41,134
that your actions will go
without consequences.

456
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:47,004
Ladies, do you want to end up in Hell?

457
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,574
The nice clothing doesn't fool anybody.

458
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,443
I know who you are,

459
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,744
and I know what you are.

460
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:01,621
What would your fathers think if they knew?

461
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:04,953
Your mothers weep.

462
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,792
Your fathers pluck out their eyes in shame!

463
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,672
- I've managed to find someone who doesn't
mind marrying a woman without a tongue,

464
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,216
but it will take some travelling.

465
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:33,277
He's been a widower
since the last six months.

466
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,481
He's looking for a wife
who can cook

467
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,115
and who doesn't mind
that he already has a son.

468
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:42,627
No, I figured as much-.

469
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,870
- "We will welcome you with open arms

470
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,666
and make sure you feel right at home
as quickly as possible.

471
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:54,867
Respectfully yours," and so on and
so forth. And there's a picture.

472
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,811
You're gonna have a real family.

473
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,250
How am I gonna do that?

474
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,823
We're sisters?

475
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,714
Frank would kill us.

476
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,848
No, you never know.

477
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:44,755
And when you've convinced
your new husband,

478
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,259
you can pay for the stagecoach
from down there.

479
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,255
How long you think you'll need?

480
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,028
- You two gotta come right away.

481
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,540
Some fella just paid a whole pile of cash
to buy out The Inferno.

482
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,405
Get your asses moving.

483
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,071
- Your last night
and you got to work too.

484
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,477
- Alright now, listen up!

485
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,254
Usually we don't earn jack-shit
at the end of the month.

486
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:21,420
Jackie, shut the fuck up right fucking now,
or I'm gonna fucking make you.

487
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:24,795
This customer right here is a godsend,

488
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,629
and he bought the right
to all of y'all this evening-.

489
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,738
And if he becomes a regular customer,
well, you can all expect

490
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:32,932
a big, fat, fucking bonus,
courtesy of me.

491
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,237
But I demand total commitment here.

492
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,973
I mean, whatever happens,

493
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,606
whatever the fuck he wants,

494
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:44,912
he is gonna get it.

495
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,121
Now if anybody -

496
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:53,751
I mean anyone -
does anything to ruin it for me...

497
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:57,925
well, they gonna be punished.

498
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:03,129
Shit, they're gonna be punished
worse than I've punished anyone before.

499
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,442
But with that fucking said,
you do a good job, and, uh...

500
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,771
shit, he'll take you all.

501
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:18,548
I want this one.

502
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,791
- Hey.

503
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:44,378
Alright now, come on!

504
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,805
You are gonna like this.

505
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:52,476
That's right, there you are.

506
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,213
My little doves.

507
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,589
Now, will you look at that, huh?

508
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:06,059
These two right here,
they're real young, real fresh.

509
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,260
Untouched, if you know what I mean.

510
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:10,234
We got all kinds here.

511
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:13,838
We've got Chinese,
if you like that kind of thing.

512
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,510
Oh, this one here, she's Jackie.

513
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,410
Jackie likes you, I can tell.

514
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,275
We've got anything you want here.

515
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,386
All your heart's desire.

516
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,045
Right here in The Inferno.

517
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,552
Oh, this one here,
well, she got a fire in her.

518
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,855
I had to cut out her tongue
just to keep her in line.

519
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,626
Good thing she can't talk back.

520
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:49,069
Oh, you have fine taste, sir.

521
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,646
This one right here,
well, she is a mystery to me.

522
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:57,384
I bought her from a band
of travelling gypsies.

523
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,475
You know, colourful types.

524
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,722
- Uh-huh.

525
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,417
- Damn,
I don't even know her real name.

526
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,684
- She's the one.

527
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,824
- Well, that's an excellent choice, sir.
May I suggest a couple of other gi...

528
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,488
- Only her.

529
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:47,367
- But you paid for the whole Inferno.

530
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,766
- I paid not to be seen doing this.

531
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:30,543
This evening has cost me a lot of money.

532
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,582
Is there something wrong with your voice?
Can't you talk?

533
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,983
- Yes, I can.

534
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,031
Would you like me to dance for you?

535
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:13,183
- I had to wait a long time to find you.

536
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,247
I am very disappointed.

537
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,791
I had considered many things,
but not this.

538
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,526
Is this what you wanted?

539
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,197
What you looked for?

540
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,046
I am prepared to forgive all your sins.

541
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:43,441
I have also sinned.
I am going to burn in Hell forever.

542
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,281
I gave up the right to go to Heaven.

543
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:49,986
But you made me do it.

544
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,055
And only you can save me.

545
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,931
- No.
- Yes.

546
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:11,136
I have sinned because
we should've finished the ceremony first.

547
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,474
Paul the Apostle wrote it
in the First Corinthians.

548
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,947
Help me, Joanna.
- I can't.

549
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,779
- Then we shall both burn in Hell.

550
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:20,786
I am here to save you
so that you can save me.

551
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,126
I will make you do it.
You know I will.

552
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:28,126
- I won't let you do that again.

553
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,094
I'll kill you first.

554
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:34,596
- I tried.
You leave me no choice.

555
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,496
- Help! Somebody! Ah!

556
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,131
Somebody, help!

557
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:43,540
- You are mine!
It is God's will!

558
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,112
- Help!

559
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,450
Get out!

560
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,491
You whore!

561
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,904
You're coming with me tonight.

562
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,944
- I need your help.

563
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:08,282
- You're not gonna get me
into trouble, are you'?

564
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,482
Are you sure about this?

565
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,818
Alright.

566
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,535
I can't do this!

567
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,383
- Are you Elizabeth Brundy?

568
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,565
- Are you sure
you're up to making this trip?

569
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,567
Well, good luck.

570
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,780
Don't let anyone see that for a while.
It's still pretty fresh.

571
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:18,388
And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

572
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:20,118
And lead us not into temptation;

573
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,286
but deliver us from evil.

574
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:25,695
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory,

575
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,960
forever and ever.
Amen.

576
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:49,749
- Ahem.

577
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:53,222
Tonight.

578
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:02,066
Joanna is still speaking Dutch.
I hold you responsible for that.

579
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:05,161
- I'll pray for the Lord's assistance.

580
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,741
- As a wife, you have your duties.

581
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:12,177
"The wife does not have authority
over her own body,

582
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:15,510
but yields it to her husband.“
Please come with me.

583
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,246
- Not tonight.

584
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:23,687
- You leave me no choice.

585
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,785
<i>We know why we came here.</i>

586
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,053
<i>This is God's nation.</i>

587
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:05,929
<i>The Lord shed his grace
on this beautiful new country.</i>

588
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:10,226
This was our Exodus.
In this city on a hill,

589
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:14,569
we will develop a purer form
of Christianity.

590
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:20,440
Hadn't we all agreed
to leave the old language behind?

591
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:24,442
Hadn't we sworn
to do things better over here?

592
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:28,612
The new world would free us
from the sins of the old.

593
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:34,125
We are the bright hope of humanity.

594
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,126
This is the Promised Land,

595
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:40,427
and by coming here,
we have become His chosen people.

596
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,799
Agatha, would you tell everyone
how you received the calling?

597
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,339
- I was at home, peeling potatoes,

598
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,005
when this huge white light appeared.

599
01:22:55,838 --> 01:23:00,378
In that light, I saw a beautiful young man
with white wings.

600
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,785
I asked if he was an angel,

601
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:07,019
and the young man nodded and smiled.

602
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,492
- Hmm.

603
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:11,858
Arie, would you be so kind

604
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,991
to share your story
of witness with us?

605
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,735
- For me, it was more or less
the same thing,

606
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:23,139
but it wasn't a man.

607
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:27,806
It was a beautiful young woman
who showed herself to me.

608
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,645
- You see?
We are the chosen people.

609
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:35,017
A visitation like that
is not something that happens

610
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,521
to just anybody.
You have to earn it.

611
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:45,162
Anna, would you please
come to the front?

612
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,914
What about you, Anna?

613
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,451
Have you received the calling yet?

614
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:12,248
- I have not been blessed in such a way.

615
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:17,455
- In our community, everyone of age
has received such a calling; you have not.

616
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:22,929
What did you do, Anna,
to... anger God this much?

617
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:31,274
My own wife,
who cannot find the Lord's favour.

618
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,242
I am ashamed of you.

619
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:32,998
- Father, I pray that my wife
will grow in her love for you,

620
01:26:33,088 --> 01:26:34,567
and me.

621
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:39,730
May she love us with all her heart, all
her soul, all her mind and all her might.

622
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:44,071
Give me the strength to lead her
to the salvation provided by your grace.

623
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:47,203
In Jesus's name... Amen.

624
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,729
You must wash your daughter.

625
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:51,232
She is unclean.

626
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,174
- But he never raises a finger
to help out,

627
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,648
- It's a woman's fate.

628
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,242
- Says who?

629
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,082
- Says the Bible.

630
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,748
- It's not fair.

631
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,560
- Your father's a man of the cloth.

632
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:18,528
He serves God
and leaves earthly chores to his wife.

633
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:22,060
What do you want?

634
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,329
- Leave us alone,
I have to talk to the girl.

635
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:40,782
Has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman?

636
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,587
- Yes.

637
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:47,421
- The blood has penetrated into your life
and driven out the innocence.

638
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:51,224
It won't be long before men
start to find you attractive.

639
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,296
Woman! I know you're listening.

640
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,804
From now on,
you must treat Joanna like a woman.

641
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:03,607
As of today, you will do the hogs.

642
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:48,613
Hello, lady.

643
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,769
I saw the pump.

644
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,997
I was hoping you'd be kind enough...

645
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,368
to let me quench my thirst.

646
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:34,560
Allow me to express... my deepest thanks.

647
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,566
- Where are you men from?

648
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:38,830
- Oh, that's a long story.

649
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,569
Maybe some other time.

650
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:46,341
- What about him?
- You take care of him.

651
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:49,244
After all, you are a Christian, I assume?

652
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:52,913
God damn me.

653
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,847
Get the horse.

654
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:23,847
- My parents will find you two.

655
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:29,120
- Then get... the goddamn saddle.

656
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,762
Go!

657
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:43,193
Go on, get out of here! Go on!

658
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,780
- Damn bullet needs to get taken out.

659
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,244
And I need taking care of too.

660
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,587
- My father wouldn't like that.

661
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:07,454
- Yeah...

662
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,461
You know what?
Don't fuckin' tell him.

663
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:34,619
- Here it comes.

664
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:02,479
- I reckon... it's about time
I introduced myself.

665
01:34:05,507 --> 01:34:06,781
I'm Samuel.

666
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,281
It's nice to meet you...?

667
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:13,689
- Joanna.

668
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:16,686
Thank you.

669
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:33,506
- The girl is growing fast.

670
01:34:58,593 --> 01:35:00,573
- Hi, sweetie.

671
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,402
- He's running a fever.

672
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,838
- Are you sure?

673
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:06,435
'Cause they say the best way
to take someones temperature

674
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:08,343
is with the lips, huh?

675
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:29,891
- How old are you now, child?

676
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:32,302
- Thirteen.

677
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:39,037
- A full-grown woman has...

678
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:42,307
has duties in life
that a young girl can't fulfill.

679
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:47,579
Duties imposed by our Lord himself.

680
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,082
Come with me, please.

681
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:10,069
Your mother does not always
assume responsibilities the way she should.

682
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:13,611
She does not comply
with her natural duties.

683
01:36:14,836 --> 01:36:16,679
Do you understand what I mean?

684
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:24,617
God has made you a woman
so soon for a reason.

685
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:29,188
You might believe it to be a curse,
but He has a reason for everything.

686
01:36:30,485 --> 01:36:34,023
You have, as the apostle Paul put it,

687
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:36,635
"passed the flower of your age."

688
01:36:36,758 --> 01:36:38,362
- This is not right.

689
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:41,363
- You have seen the blood.

690
01:36:43,031 --> 01:36:44,704
- She's just a child.

691
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:50,341
- I need not answer to you.
Only to God.

692
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:30,246
No, thank you, Anna.

693
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:32,255
God has other plans.

694
01:37:59,674 --> 01:38:01,085
- It'll be alright.

695
01:38:03,678 --> 01:38:05,282
Use both hands.

696
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:10,029
Don't let the blast scare you.

697
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:13,288
- You're a grown woman now, Joanna.

698
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,646
- Could I talk to you for a moment?

699
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:26,232
I want to offer my apologies.

700
01:40:26,988 --> 01:40:30,231
I withheld from you
that to which you have a right.

701
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,235
That was wrong of me.

702
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:37,066
- Apology accepted.
- Let me make it up to you.

703
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,876
- It's too late for that.

704
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:43,881
- I have seen how you look at her.

705
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:47,880
She's your own daughter.

706
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,395
It's a sin.

707
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:59,395
- It does not have to be.

708
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,194
"If any man thinks
that he is behaving himself unseemly

709
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:05,066
toward his virgin daughter,
if she pass the flower of her age,

710
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:07,900
and if need so requires,
let him do what he will;

711
01:41:08,029 --> 01:41:10,566
he is not sinning; let them marry.“

712
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:18,941
- You shall be scolded.

713
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:20,245
" No!

714
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:33,797
Good girl.

715
01:42:04,352 --> 01:42:06,525
- That sure as hell took long enough.

716
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,997
- Where are you going?

717
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,763
- Gonna take a crap.

718
01:42:15,162 --> 01:42:17,142
- Where you want me to put this?

719
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:20,768
- I need some rope and I need it fast.
Can you get that for me?

720
01:42:21,669 --> 01:42:22,977
Good.

721
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,507
I had to do that.

722
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:38,773
If I hadn't,
he'd have killed me at some point.

723
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,642
Better him than me, I'd say.

724
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:47,022
I heard that story once.

725
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:50,422
The one about turning
the other cheek and all that.

726
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:55,027
The only person who'd say
something like that

727
01:44:55,156 --> 01:44:57,966
is someone who's in control.

728
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:02,137
Someone who doesn't want you
to stand up to him.

729
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:07,771
I've seen your mother.

730
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:12,182
She's the kind of person
that turns the other cheek.

731
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:15,478
Are you like her?

738

Why do you let him do this?

739
01:46:42,029 --> 01:46:43,906
I'll never be like you.

740
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:45,772
This is no way to live.

741
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:50,439
I'd rather die first.

742
01:47:16,664 --> 01:47:18,166
- The serpent said to the woman,

743
01:47:18,299 --> 01:47:20,301
"You surely will not die!

744
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:23,938
For God knows that in the day you eat
from it, your eyes will be opened,

745
01:47:24,071 --> 01:47:27,678
and you will be like God,
knowing good and evil."

746
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:30,789
And when the woman saw
that the tree was good for food,

747
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:32,447
and was a delight to the eyes,

748
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:36,152
and that the tree was
desirable to make one wise,

749
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:39,093
she took from its fruit and ate.

750
01:47:40,521 --> 01:47:43,161
And then the Lord God
said to the woman:

751
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,499
"I will greatly multiply
your pain in childbirth,

752
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:48,868
In pain you will bring forth children;

753
01:47:48,996 --> 01:47:53,103
Yet your desire will be for your husband,

754
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,202
And he will rule over you.“

755
01:48:02,676 --> 01:48:04,349
This is an abomination.

756
01:48:06,013 --> 01:48:07,720
This is an abomination!

757
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,793
Does she not know that her body is
the temple of the Holy Spirit,

758
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:14,491
which she received from God?

759
01:48:14,621 --> 01:48:16,623
This is a disgrace.

760
01:48:16,724 --> 01:48:19,170
She will be punished in Hell.

761
01:48:19,293 --> 01:48:22,502
She will be transformed
into a thorny tree,

762
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:26,167
and in a tortured wood,
she will be punished by harpies,

763
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:28,712
who will dig their sharp talons into her,

764
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:31,373
until the blood comes flowing down!

765
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:36,544
O Lord.

766
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:38,846
Forgive me.

767
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:42,517
You know I have tried to keep her
on the narrow way to repentance.

768
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:47,359
The way is broad that leads to destruction.

769
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:49,925
I spoke to her.

770
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,432
I chastised her.

771
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,838
But to no avail.

772
01:48:59,233 --> 01:49:00,541
I failed.

773
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,398
- There, there.

774
01:49:53,487 --> 01:49:54,989
It's alright.

775
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:57,427
It's alright.

776
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:12,242
- I'm old enough.

777
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:17,411
- I know.

778
01:50:58,819 --> 01:51:01,026
- God has forgiven me.

779
01:51:01,355 --> 01:51:02,857
I am ready.

780
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:17,338
<i>Thank you, Lord,
Thank you, Almighty.</i>

781
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:19,883
<i>You saw, and foresaw ail.</i>

782
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:24,052
<i>You saw that my wife did not do
what you expected of her.</i>

783
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:27,682
That she did not love you, or me,
as my daughter will.

784
01:51:28,315 --> 01:51:31,762
Lot lay with their daughters
and they bore children unto him.

785
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:34,832
Joanna and I shall enter
a state of matrimony

786
01:51:34,922 --> 01:51:37,095
and she shall bear my children.

787
01:51:37,224 --> 01:51:39,898
We shall be joyous and honour you.

788
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:41,904
- Ah! Let me go!

789
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:44,009
Fear not.

790
01:51:44,097 --> 01:51:46,407
- No!!! Ah!!

791
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:48,035
No!!

792
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:51,672
- It is the will of God.
We are his chosen ones.

793
01:51:51,772 --> 01:51:55,413
When two people make their vows
in the name of the Everlasting,

794
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,853
they pronounce their wish
to belong to each other, fully in love.

795
01:51:58,946 --> 01:52:02,587
Together they shall search
for what God wants from their lives.

796
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:06,721
Together they shall perform their duties
and care for their family.

797
01:52:32,613 --> 01:52:34,923
- My father was a real bastard.

798
01:52:35,048 --> 01:52:39,258
Used to put cigars out on my arm,
the sadistic fuck.

799
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:44,158
And he was a pervert, just like you.

800
01:52:45,225 --> 01:52:48,069
I killed him when I was nine years old.

801
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:49,640
- Who are you?

802
01:52:50,397 --> 01:52:53,173
- You have a real special daughter.

803
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,807
She deserves to be free.

804
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:06,246
- You think you can come in here
and take that which belongs to me?

805
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:10,194
- Yeah. What do you think?

806
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:13,424
That God's gonna come down here
and save you'?

807
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,603
- I am as God. He is as I am.

808
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:36,445
I will love you.

809
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:38,454
And you will learn to love me.

810
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:40,786
It is God's will.
- I will kill you!

811
01:53:40,881 --> 01:53:43,885
- That would not stop me.
- You're mad!

812
01:53:44,017 --> 01:53:47,658
- Who was that man?
He put foolish thoughts in your mind.

813
01:53:47,788 --> 01:53:50,234
- He helped me. I love him!

814
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:54,533
- No, you do not.

815
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,504
It is lust.

816
01:53:58,699 --> 01:54:00,042
- Yes.

817
01:54:05,372 --> 01:54:07,579
- I will beat your mother out of you.

818
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:36,377
The time has come.

819
01:54:36,503 --> 01:54:38,380
I will be gentle.

Are we there yet?

827
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:14,469
Ah!! Ah!

828
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:17,305
What was that?

829
02:01:17,437 --> 02:01:19,576
No, let me go!

830
02:01:19,672 --> 02:01:21,811

- Matthew!

831
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:24,148
- Stay there, Sam!
Whatever happens!

832
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:25,813
- Matthew!

833
02:01:28,148 --> 02:01:29,627
Ah!!!

834
02:01:31,684 --> 02:01:33,288
Mama!

835
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,967
Matthew!

836
02:03:34,974 --> 02:03:36,612
- Oh, Liz...

837
02:03:37,744 --> 02:03:41,886
I'd always hoped
this place would be Eli's someday.

838
02:03:44,317 --> 02:03:45,625
I mean...

839
02:03:45,752 --> 02:03:47,993
he could've...

840
02:03:48,121 --> 02:03:49,725
I don't know...

841
02:03:49,822 --> 02:03:52,302
a sawmill or something...

842
02:04:16,582 --> 02:04:18,459
Are you sure?

843
02:04:18,584 --> 02:04:21,155
You ever fired one of those things before?

844
02:04:25,825 --> 02:04:28,305
- I should be the one holding the gun.

845
02:05:03,896 --> 02:05:06,308
- There's no use shooting
from that distance.

846
02:05:17,577 --> 02:05:20,387
It's more difficult than you think,

847
02:05:20,513 --> 02:05:22,857
especially with a gun like that.

848
02:05:35,895 --> 02:05:39,035
I was truly prepared to forgive you,
back in Bismuth.

849
02:05:40,433 --> 02:05:41,844
I loved you.

850
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:44,039
You should have seen that.

851
02:05:48,207 --> 02:05:49,948
You've turned against me.

852
02:05:51,177 --> 02:05:52,713
Just like your mother.

853
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:57,459
But again, I have been provided
with an alternative.

854
02:06:00,953 --> 02:06:02,796
That's right, Joanna.

855
02:06:03,956 --> 02:06:06,129
Your daughter shall
suffer for your actions.

856
02:06:08,027 --> 02:06:11,941
And I will make you watch
<i>as</i> I chastise her.

857
02:06:12,065 --> 02:06:15,239
And after that, you will witness
how I make her a woman.

858
02:06:18,137 --> 02:06:20,413
You believe she's safe in there?

859
02:06:20,773 --> 02:06:22,480
That I cannot get to her?

860
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:26,988
You left her alone, Joanna.

861
02:06:27,413 --> 02:06:29,893
Never leave your loved ones alone.

862
02:06:29,982 --> 02:06:31,723
You should know that by now.

863
02:06:36,255 --> 02:06:39,327
What is the worst thing
I could do to you, Joanna?

864
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:43,467
Lucky for her, she was asleep.

865
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:45,507
She did not see a thing.

866
02:07:00,646 --> 02:07:02,455
Huh'? What?

867
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:27,846
- Beware... of false prophets...

868
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:32,286
who come to you in sheep's clothing.

869
02:07:33,613 --> 02:07:37,288
For inwardly...
they are ravening wolves.

870
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:10,190
- Mama! Ah!

871
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:13,724
No! Mama! Mama!

872
02:08:13,853 --> 02:08:15,230
No!!

873
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:22,396
Mama!

874
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,030
Mama!

875
02:08:46,118 --> 02:08:49,565
- I will do to your daughter
exactly as I did to you.

876
02:08:53,092 --> 02:08:55,698
I am going to hurt you
as much <i>as</i> I can.

877
02:09:02,535 --> 02:09:06,312

878
02:09:06,439 --> 02:09:11,946

879
02:09:37,403 --> 02:09:39,610
I will leave the door open.

880
02:10:16,342 --> 02:10:17,980
I brought you this.

881
02:10:24,383 --> 02:10:27,660
Has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman?

882
02:10:29,822 --> 02:10:33,497
Many people believe that God
does not approve of violence.

883
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:37,330
They have not read their Bible.

884
02:10:37,463 --> 02:10:41,138
"Violence cleanses evil.
It purifies the heart."

885
02:10:42,802 --> 02:10:45,043
Does your heart need purifying?

886
02:10:46,405 --> 02:10:48,180
Have you had bad thoughts?

887
02:10:49,408 --> 02:10:51,251
About men, perhaps?

888
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,056
Do you like men?

889
02:11:02,488 --> 02:11:04,263
Have you bled yet?

890
02:11:23,175 --> 02:11:25,519
I am a doomed man, Sam.

891
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:28,917
Beyond salvation.

892
02:11:29,048 --> 02:11:31,961
I can do whatever I want.

893
02:11:37,957 --> 02:11:40,904
Young girls still carry
the scent of innocence.

894
02:11:42,428 --> 02:11:45,534
Older women smell different.

895
02:11:56,742 --> 02:11:58,380
The time has come.

896
02:12:46,325 --> 02:12:49,772
People think it's the flames
that make Hell unbearable.

897
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:52,870
It's not.

898
02:12:54,133 --> 02:12:56,306
It is the absence of love.

899
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,540
. Hey-

900
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:09,451
Mm-hmm.

901
02:14:38,871 --> 02:14:42,978
- Well... longtime no see, Liz.

902
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:52,725
I was a broken man.

903
02:14:53,152 --> 02:14:55,325
Couldn't go on living there.

904
02:14:56,288 --> 02:15:00,293
Good thing the new preacher showed me
I had to go try somewhere else.

905
02:15:00,759 --> 02:15:03,797
He was the one told me
they was lookin' for deputies,

906
02:15:03,929 --> 02:15:05,306
up in Bismuth.

907
02:15:06,732 --> 02:15:09,144
I made myself up a new life there.

908
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:15,616
'Bout a year ago,
the sheriff there got himself shot,

909
02:15:15,741 --> 02:15:17,482
and I was chosen to replace him.

910
02:15:19,311 --> 02:15:21,655
While I was cleaning out his office...

911
02:15:24,783 --> 02:15:26,626
I found this.

912
02:15:31,957 --> 02:15:34,198
You should've changed your name, Liz.

913
02:15:35,494 --> 02:15:39,135
How many Elizabeth Brundys
you figure there are in this world?

914
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:42,108
And how many of 'em
you figure don't got no tongue?

915
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:50,449
Elizabeth Brundy,
I hereby arrest you

916
02:15:50,542 --> 02:15:52,488
for the murder of Frank Blain,

917
02:15:52,611 --> 02:15:56,787
your former employer
and proprietor of Frank's Inferno.

918
02:16:27,346 --> 02:16:29,849
Your past done caught up with you, Liz.

919
02:17:29,808 --> 02:17:31,754
<i>As life progresses,</i>

920
02:17:31,877 --> 02:17:33,652
<i>images blur.</i>

921
02:17:35,581 --> 02:17:38,061
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

922
02:17:47,092 --> 02:17:49,299
<i>I</i> remember her <i>well.</i>

923
02:17:51,096 --> 02:17:52,973
<i>She was a warrior.</i>

924
02:17:53,098 --> 02:17:55,100
<i>Always in control.</i>

925
02:18:16,688 --> 02:18:19,362
<i>We often wondered
what she was thinking about</i>

926
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:21,129
<i>on her way down.</i>

927
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:26,507
<i>I like to think she thought of me.</i>

928
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:33,611
<i>I like to think she knew
I would grow up to be strong.</i>

929
02:19:28,327 --> 02:19:30,204
<i>I remember her well.</i>

930
02:19:30,929 --> 02:19:32,738
<i>At least I think I do.</i>

931
02:19:36,401 --> 02:19:39,177
<i>It feels like she always
stayed with me.</i>

932
02:19:43,108 --> 02:19:44,519
<i>Watching over me.</i>

933
02:19:46,044 --> 02:19:48,388
Protecting me.

934
02:19:48,513 --> 02:19:50,754
Hey, come on. Put that down.

935
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:07,608
- Mama?

936
02:20:08,267 --> 02:20:09,575
You coming?

937
02:28:20,892 --> 02:28:22,929
CNST, Montreal
