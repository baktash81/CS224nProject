1
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,220
You're always sick.

2
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,681
You were sick
when you were my age.

3
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,643
Evening, sir.

4
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,939
Evening, Victor.
I didn't realize that you're still here.

5
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,652
I'm just keeping James company, sir.
If that's all right...

6
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:13,489
Very kind of you.

7
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,618
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, father.

8
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:20,204
It's just a mild fever.
You'll be all right in the morning.

9
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:24,875
- You always say that.
- And you always pull through, don't you?

10
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:29,337
Now... take your medicine.

11
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,090
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

12
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:33,841
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

13
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,802
Your father's drunk again.

14
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:37,678
You should help him home, Victor.

15
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:40,347
It's not my name he's calling, sir.

16
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:44,017
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James!

17
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,936
Father!

18
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:51,232
<i>I told you never to come back here!</i>

19
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,802
James...

20
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,471
There are things you
don't understand.

21
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:24,680
- Don't...
- I need him them to know!

22
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:25,347
Please no!

23
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:26,515
- No... more... lies!

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,433
James...

25
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:47,952
James!

26
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:56,418
He... he wasn't your father...

27
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,218
...son.

28
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,311
What are you?

29
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,953
- I didn't mean it! I didn't--
- Yes, you did!

30
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:39,124
He deserved it!
And you gave it to him.

31
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,838
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realize that?

32
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:47,006
Brothers protect each other.

33
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,133
You have to be hard now.

34
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:52,220
Hard enough they can't ever touch us.

35
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,013
I want to go home.

36
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:57,433
We can't. We stick together
no matter what.

37
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,561
And take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

38
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,397
Can you do that, little brother?

39
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:11,738
They're coming.
Can you run? Okay.

40
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:17,284
Keep on running.
Don't look back.

41
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,880
Enough! Enough!

42
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:45,240
Stand down, soldier!

43
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:51,512
Stand down!

44
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,294
Victor, no!

45
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,028
Ready!

46
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:31,530
Aim!

47
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,657
Wake me when it's over.

48
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:40,788
Fire!

49
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,695
My name is Major William Stryker.

50
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:59,115
You were sentenced to death
for decapitating a senior officer.

51
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,908
Is that correct?

52
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:03,244
Apparently we have some
issues with authority.

53
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,495
Just keep a lid on it.

54
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,330
Sir.

55
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:09,374
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out

56
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,668
by a firing squad at 1000 hours

57
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,879
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

58
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,594
You boys tired of running?

59
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:24,472
Tired of denying your...true nature?

60
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,891
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care...

61
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,726
I care cause I know
how special you are,

62
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:31,895
how valuable.

63
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:36,941
Look.

64
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:40,904
You can stay here, locked up
like freaks of nature,

65
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,698
or you can join me.

66
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,953
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

67
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,957
Now tell me. How would you like
to really serve your country?

68
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,347
I love this weapon more than anything
in the whole wide world.

69
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:11,724
- You wanna know why?
- No.

70
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,685
It's memorable.

71
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:17,354
Sure, it's a little bulky,
to have to get 'em on a plane.

72
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,482
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

73
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,151
they will never, ever forget it.

74
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:27,155
That's funny, Wade.
I didn't think you liked girls.

75
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:31,701
Right, it is...it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun or

76
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:35,704
bone claws or the fingernails
of a bag lady...

77
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:48,216
- Manicure?
- Victor...easy.

78
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,677
Speaking of sharp,
Fred got a new tattoo.

79
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:55,806
- I'm concerned.
- Oh geez, Fred, you just met her last night.

80
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,892
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

81
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,687
She's a gymnast.

82
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:04,189
Bradley, take her down.

83
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,446
Are you gonna puke?

84
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,239
If we were meant to fly,
we'd have grown wings.

85
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,908
Oh, don't worry man. See, more people
die driving than flying.

86
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:16,992
How about from impaling?

87
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,163
Hey, be nice.
Or your approximation of nice.

88
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,249
Would you like a bucket?

89
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,335
Gentlemen, wheels down
in Lagos in five.

90
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:07,039
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero...

91
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:53,311
- Victor, high ground lookout.
- Having fun yet?

92
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:01,375
- Fred...
- Tank?

93
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,669
- Tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

94
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,390
Great!

95
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,351
Stuck in an elevator with five guys
on a high protein diet.

96
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:45,103
- Oh Wade!
- Dreams really do come true.

97
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,104
Would you just shut it!
You're up next.

98
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:49,440
Thank you, sir.
You look very nice today.

99
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:50,399
It's the green.

100
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,192
Brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

101
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:55,988
- Oh my God, do you ever shut up, pal?
- No. Not when I'm awake.

102
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,741
Bradley? Top floor, please.

103
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:09,625
Cover the elevator!
The elevator!

104
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:22,012
Time to go to work.

105
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,838
Okay!

106
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,090
People are dead!

107
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,804
If you haven't that mouth on you, Wade,
you'd be the perfect soldier.

108
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:23,318
Take the diamonds, they're yours.

109
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:24,862
I don't want your diamonds.

110
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,406
I want this.

111
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,868
That? That is nothing. A souvenir.

112
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:35,413
Where did you find it?
I want the source.

113
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:41,544
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

114
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,174
Tell him that this rock is more valuable
to me than his life.

115
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:48,550
Ask him where he found it.

116
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,440
He says it came from the sky.

117
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,112
He's telling the truth.

118
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:14,241
- You don't know their language, Logan.
- It's a meteor fragment.

119
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:17,118
I know what it is.
I'm asking him where he found it.

120
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,079
Sir, base wants to know our location.

121
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,122
Shut him down.

122
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:29,505
Tell him everyone here will die unless
he tells me where he found the rock.

123
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,142
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay, fine.

124
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,356
Victor...

125
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,664
Victor!

126
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,585
Don't even think about it!

127
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,880
We didn't sign up for this.

128
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:21,470
Put him down.

129
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,316
What are you doing?

130
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:38,777
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

131
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:42,739
- Enough, it's enough. We've done enough.
- Who do you think you are?

132
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:45,325
This is what we do.

133
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,827
Maybe you'd rather be rotting
in a hole somewhere

134
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:49,787
till they figure out a way
to do it to us, is that it?

135
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:50,997
Uh?

136
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:53,791
I'm done.

137
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,671
You coming?

138
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:06,053
Jimmy!

139
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:12,517
We can't just let you walk away!

140
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,485
Jimmy!

141
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,864
Jimmy!

142
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,995
Why are you up so early?

143
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,332
Come here.

144
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,244
See you baby.

145
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:14,171
Oh, that's nice! Yeah!

146
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,906
No. Come on.

147
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,800
Hey, what do you do?

148
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,054
You turn off the light, you win a prize.

149
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,433
- Two tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it!

150
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:20,733
Um, that's obvious.

151
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,488
That's two.

152
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:39,250
- That's a stupid trick.
- It's not a trick, man.

153
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,377
C'mon.

154
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,755
Bye!

155
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,158
Show's over!

156
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:22,874
I said, show's over!

157
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:30,547
The show is never over for us, Bradley.

158
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:35,677
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

159
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,015
Yeah, come on in.

160
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,736
You know, I've never said anything

161
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:57,239
to anyone...about what happened.

162
00:21:57,948 --> 00:22:00,617
I'm living a totally different life now,
but uh...

163
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:02,911
No need to bring up the past.

164
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:20,260
You know,

165
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:24,389
I always thought it would be Wade
coming knocking at my door.

166
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:30,561
Well, Wade's gone.

167
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:37,109
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

168
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:41,238
I'm not afraid to die.

169
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:47,452
How do you know?
You've never tried it before.

170
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,679
Was it the wars?

171
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:12,308
- Which one?
- All of 'em.

172
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,234
Tell me.

173
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,737
It's just a scratch.

174
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,455
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

175
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,206
Yeah...

176
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:04,065
Who the hell is this?

177
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,317
It smells like government.

178
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,698
My God!
Haven't aged a day!

179
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:14,449
Clean living.

180
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,326
You remember Agent Zero.

181
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:18,953
Still shooting first and
asking questions later?

182
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:22,832
You still chewing those cheap cigars?

183
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:27,294
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

184
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,713
- I already have a job.
- Lumberjack.

185
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:32,091
- Eighteen grand a year?
- Eighteen five.

186
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:34,343
Plus I haven't had
to kill anyone in a while.

187
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:36,553
- Start to miss it?
- Yeah, right now I am.

188
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:39,472
Zero, back to the car.

189
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,518
Attaboy.

190
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,402
You know, I'm not proud about the way
things ended between us.

191
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,320
Conversation's over.

192
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,908
Play the little house on the prairie
with a...a school teacher.

193
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:02,077
That's just isn't you, Logan.

194
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:03,912
And you would know, huh?

195
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:05,830
I would.

196
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:07,457
What do you want, Stryker?

197
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,377
Bradley was killed three days ago.

198
00:25:12,962 --> 00:25:15,589
Wade, before that.

199
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:18,800
I believe that someone is
hunting down our whole team.

200
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,470
Anyone else?

201
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:24,264
As far as I know,
Victor is safe.

202
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:30,228
- Whoever it is, he's had names, addresses...
- I can take care of myself.

203
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,398
This is not about you, Logan.

204
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,154
Country needs you.

205
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:42,698
I am Canadian.

206
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:46,826
I know you, Logan!
I know who you are!

207
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:26,405
What's wrong?

208
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,825
Stryker came by today.

209
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:32,702
Don't worry, I said no.

210
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:35,580
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

211
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:38,374
Because I'm the best
there is at what I do.

212
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,459
And what I do best
isn't very nice.

213
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:43,587
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

214
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:47,633
A gift? You can return a gift.

215
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:01,854
Come on, fellas!

216
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:08,986
- Stay in the car.
- I'm just gonna ask nicely.

217
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:15,367
Mind lettin' us go by?

218
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:17,035
You're in some kind of
a hurry there, pal?

219
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:18,286
Are ya?

220
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:22,457
- Just move your truck so we can go by...
- Trying to have a conversation there, right!

221
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,543
If you start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

222
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:27,628
Hey guys, take it easy!

223
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:35,969
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
- I know.

224
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:41,015
Big temper too,
so please, let us pass.

225
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:46,771
Thank you!

226
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:51,192
How did you do that?

227
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:54,194
You know, power of persuasion is a gift.

228
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:57,823
I see...
Do you, uh, have those powers over me?

229
00:27:58,073 --> 00:28:01,243
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

230
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,218
Why is the moon so lonely?

231
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:22,804
Why?

232
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:25,432
Because she used to have a lover.

233
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:27,851
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

234
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:32,063
His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived
in the spirit world together.

235
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:34,357
Ah, it's a true story.
Right.

236
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:38,736
And every night,
they would wander the skies together.

237
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:43,824
But...one of the other spirits
was jealous.

238
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:47,452
Trickster, one of the moons from South,

239
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:51,581
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

240
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:55,668
He told him to come to our world
and pick up some wild roses,

241
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,797
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the spirit world,

242
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:03,342
you can never go back.

243
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:09,598
And every night, he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

244
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:13,768
But...

245
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,980
...he can never touch her again.

246
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:24,236
Koo-koo-Kachooka got screwed.

247
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,614
Kuekuatsheu.

248
00:29:33,953 --> 00:29:37,665
Means the Wolverine.

249
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,097
What you're doing, Logan?

250
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:35,941
Kayla!

251
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,128
You're not from around here, are you?

252
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,800
What gave me away?

253
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,516
- You got an insurance in this place?
- Insurance?

254
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,935
No.

255
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,728
Too bad.

256
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:19,329
Well, well, well...
Look what the cat dragged in.

257
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,707
Guys, whatever this is,
take it outside.

258
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:37,471
- Why?
- Why?

259
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:44,769
You don't call,
you don't write.

260
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:49,523
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

261
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:32,813
I hate to say it, James,
but, frankly, I'm a little disappointed.

262
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:35,983
Stay down.

263
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:18,126
Tell me something, Jimmy,
was she worth it?

264
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:38,937
When are you gonna figure it out?

265
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:43,109
We are not like them.

266
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:54,201
- I... am nothing like you.
- Sure you are. You just don't know it yet.

267
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:09,737
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

268
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:14,533
What? Is this a joke?
The guy's fine.

269
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:16,117
Where is he?

270
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:16,826
I said where is he!

271
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,786
I don't know who he is.

272
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:20,976
I can help you.

273
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:30,735
Six years I've been here. No one
knew me and then you show up!

274
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:34,072
- And the next day, she's dead!
- I tried to warn you.

275
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:37,116
- Why don't you tell me it was Victor?
- I didn't know!

276
00:36:40,744 --> 00:36:44,581
I swear on my son's life!
I didn't...

277
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,986
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

278
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,447
I had to lock him up.
He thought I'd betrayed him.

279
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:01,785
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

280
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:05,497
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to save your own ass.

281
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,332
So what's your plan, captain?

282
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,168
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't.

283
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:12,211
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

284
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:16,131
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

285
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:25,515
- So we can still save the others.
- You mean save yourself, right?

286
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,685
I promise you two things:

287
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,896
You'll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure,

288
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:34,482
but you'll have your revenge.

289
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:40,612
If I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

290
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:44,783
No law, no code of conduct.

291
00:37:45,158 --> 00:37:49,245
You point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way.

292
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:29,908
When it starts,

293
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,620
whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

294
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,831
focus on that.
Maybe it will help.

295
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,500
Trust me, I've been through worse.

296
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,002
No, you haven't.

297
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:43,379
We are ready.

298
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:50,552
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.

299
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:57,058
Remember what we were
looking for in Africa?

300
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:58,017
I remember.

301
00:38:58,101 --> 00:38:58,935
Well, I found it.

302
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:05,316
It helped us create a...
metal compound so strong

303
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:08,360
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything.

304
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:11,113
It's called Adamantium.

305
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,158
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

306
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:20,788
To kill him, you're gonna have to
embrace the other side.

307
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,500
Become the animal.

308
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:27,920
Let's do this.

309
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:30,047
I almost forgot.

310
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:35,427
I want new ones.

311
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,637
What do you want them to say?

312
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:40,932
Wolverine.

313
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:01,117
Generals!
Welcome.

314
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,161
General Munson.

315
00:40:04,204 --> 00:40:07,373
Today, we're gonna witness
medical history.

316
00:40:07,582 --> 00:40:10,877
- Today, we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

317
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,130
Roman numeral, Ten.

318
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:20,594
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton

319
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:22,637
Let's begin.

320
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:11,224
<i>- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!</i>

321
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:13,768
Body temperature is 1-0-8
and rising.

322
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:19,523
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

323
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:23,110
He feels pain, just like the rest of us.
Anaesthesia won't work on him.

324
00:41:23,193 --> 00:41:24,987
That's why he had to volunteer.

325
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:27,072
195.

326
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:28,991
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

327
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:30,700
200.

328
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:34,204
<i>...son.</i>

329
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:37,248
Heartbeat's well beyond maximum.

330
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:39,667
- Blood pressure?
- 260 on 180.

331
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,211
He can make it, he can make it.

332
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,258
<i>Victor!</i>

333
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,390
<i>I love you.</i>

334
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,559
<i>You're not an animal, Logan.</i>

335
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:05,149
<i>It means...
the Wolverine.</i>

336
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,051
I guess he can die.

337
00:43:04,954 --> 00:43:07,832
Come on, old friend.
Come back.

338
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:12,253
Heart rate rising.

339
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:16,215
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

340
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:19,843
No rejection.
Procedure completed.

341
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:21,261
We did it!

342
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,145
We take him to the island?

343
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:34,190
The island?
No.

344
00:43:34,982 --> 00:43:39,945
<i>The bonding works.
We use his DNA for the XI.</i>

345
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,282
Erase his memory.

346
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,370
<i>Fry his brain!</i>

347
00:43:58,629 --> 00:44:00,422
I think he heard you.

348
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:17,814
Lockdown!

349
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:57,934
Hunt him down.
Take his head off.

350
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,849
Travis!

351
00:45:48,147 --> 00:45:52,234
I think there is some
naked man in the barn.

352
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:53,152
Yep.

353
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:27,392
Son...

354
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,435
What in hell are you doing?

355
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:33,147
- It's cold.
- Cold?

356
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,738
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

357
00:46:41,822 --> 00:46:44,616
- You're not onto drugs, are you?
- No.

358
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:49,120
- Hmm. You just had a rough night.
- Yeah, you could say that.

359
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:54,459
Come on up the house.

360
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:58,004
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

361
00:46:58,879 --> 00:47:01,340
Here, cover it up with that.

362
00:47:01,715 --> 00:47:04,718
I don't want to give an old lady
a heart attack.

363
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:51,928
You're right in there?

364
00:47:52,012 --> 00:47:53,472
Yeah, everything's fine.

365
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:58,768
- Supper's on the table.
- I... Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

366
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:12,781
I swear I'm gonna pay for it.

367
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,409
Set it down over there.

368
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:23,207
Come and sit down, son.

369
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:32,049
I can't thank you both enough...
for everything.

370
00:48:32,132 --> 00:48:34,927
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

371
00:48:35,385 --> 00:48:38,305
- Decent...
- What?

372
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:42,434
Um... Nothing, I'm just not
really used to that word.

373
00:48:45,186 --> 00:48:48,022
- That's a nice chopper you've got out there.
- You know motorcycle?

374
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:49,940
Oh Lord, here we go!

375
00:48:50,024 --> 00:48:51,317
My favorite is a '48 Panhead.

376
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,610
I bought one new off the line.

377
00:48:52,693 --> 00:48:55,362
I think you're a little young
for that, son.

378
00:48:55,446 --> 00:48:58,573
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

379
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,492
In the barn.

380
00:49:01,243 --> 00:49:03,578
Nothing you can break out there.

381
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:18,383
<i>I love you.</i>

382
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:22,345
<i>- Why is the moon so lonely?
- Why?</i>

383
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,516
<i>Because she used to have a lover.</i>

384
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:31,229
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

385
00:49:50,538 --> 00:49:51,372
You sleep ok?

386
00:49:53,499 --> 00:49:55,001
Uh...yeah.

387
00:49:57,211 --> 00:50:01,382
You look like a man fixing
to do a bad thing.

388
00:50:03,008 --> 00:50:06,595
You know what happens
to many looking for blood?

389
00:50:06,928 --> 00:50:10,765
- What?
- They find it.

390
00:50:13,268 --> 00:50:17,105
- We all got a choice, son.
- Yeah, mine got taken.

391
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,106
Bullshit.

392
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,154
This was my son's jacket.

393
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:28,699
Try it on.

394
00:50:44,338 --> 00:50:48,175
- Thank you.
- Yep...

395
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:53,638
You wanna take my bike for a spin,
test the suspension.

396
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:57,016
'64, huh?

397
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:03,022
- Man, you're heavy.
- Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

398
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:03,940
Good morning.

399
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:05,066
Good morning.

400
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,738
Oh, it fits you beautifully!

401
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:13,615
I brought you some...

402
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:25,376
<i>Weapon X is in the barn.
He just murdered two civilians.</i>

403
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,713
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

404
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,604
<i>Fire at will.</i>

405
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:54,947
Come and get me!

406
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:09,213
Blow his head up.

407
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,881
Damn!

408
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,999
Alpha One, do not lose him!

409
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,509
<i>Alpha 2, target's coming to you!</i>

410
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,829
PULL UP!

411
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:02,257
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

412
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:04,550
I'm down

413
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:08,026
<i>Did you get him?is Logan dead?</i>

414
00:55:13,596 --> 00:55:15,389
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

415
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,556
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

416
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:23,058
Logan?

417
00:55:23,183 --> 00:55:24,350
Where is Victor?

418
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:26,269
Come back to base.

419
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:28,396
I'll explain everything,
we'll take Victor down together.

420
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:30,022
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

421
00:55:30,106 --> 00:55:32,775
After I've killed Victor,
I'm coming for you.

422
00:55:35,528 --> 00:55:37,529
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

423
00:55:37,613 --> 00:55:40,115
If you go down this road, you're
not gonna like what you find.

424
00:55:41,283 --> 00:55:43,618
You wanted the animal, Colonel?

425
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,496
You got it.

426
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:52,585
Those were good people
back there.

427
00:55:52,835 --> 00:55:54,920
Innocent people.

428
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:07,038
It's funny how good innocent people
tend to die around you.

429
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,371
Zero never stood a chance.

430
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:35,208
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet

431
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:45,509
This facility is compromised.
Prep transport.

432
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:56,436
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

433
00:56:56,936 --> 00:56:59,147
- Don't worry, we'll stop him.
- Really?

434
00:56:59,272 --> 00:57:02,483
You've just spent half a billion
dollars making him indestructible.

435
00:57:05,694 --> 00:57:07,071
- Sir?
- Yes.

436
00:57:07,196 --> 00:57:10,240
The young mutant you've been looking for?
We found him.

437
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:13,368
General, Logan isn't the only
piece in this puzzle.

438
00:57:13,452 --> 00:57:17,414
I need to evacuate this facility.
Please, go back to Washington.

439
00:57:17,622 --> 00:57:18,957
We've got work to do.

440
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,775
Yo hablo: I talk,
tu hablas: you talk, el habla?

441
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,360
Somebody translate?

442
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,446
Summers?

443
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,365
Sit up and take off those glasses.

444
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,785
I have a headache.

445
00:57:36,118 --> 00:57:38,537
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

446
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,248
while you add up
this conjugation 100 times.

447
00:57:41,874 --> 00:57:42,749
Somebody else?

448
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:43,792
<i>He talks.</i>

449
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,961
Thank you, he talks.
El habla.

450
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,724
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

451
00:58:00,683 --> 00:58:02,935
Damn!

452
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,062
I'm sorry, mate.

453
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:09,775
What the hell happened
to him after I left?

454
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,692
He got worse.

455
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:13,028
He felt like you abandoned him.

456
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:14,946
Hell, we all do.

457
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:18,783
But Victor, he had to prove you
he was better than you.

458
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:21,619
Hunting and killing
everything's he was pointin' at.

459
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:25,998
Quit a few months later myself,
couldn't take rounding them up.

460
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:29,793
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

461
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:31,837
Rounding who up, John?

462
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,422
Hey! God damn it, John!

463
00:58:34,506 --> 00:58:36,841
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

464
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,594
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

465
00:58:39,677 --> 00:58:40,511
Mutants?

466
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:43,347
Why?

467
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:46,142
Stryker'd say we would
make a difference.

468
00:58:46,475 --> 00:58:49,186
Protecting people from the bad ones.

469
00:58:57,068 --> 00:58:59,571
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

470
00:59:00,196 --> 00:59:03,699
- Remember that stuff in Africa?
- Yeah, I remember Africa, what about it?

471
00:59:07,953 --> 00:59:09,205
Damn!

472
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:12,207
What'd they do to you?

473
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,251
Don't ask.

474
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:20,173
Listen, Zero said something about an island.
Does that mean anything to you?

475
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,257
Nope.

476
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:22,884
But maybe Dukes knows.

477
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:25,011
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes?

478
00:59:25,136 --> 00:59:26,345
- Where is he?
- He's here.

479
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:28,347
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- Hold on.

480
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,266
He don't get in until around four.

481
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:33,519
But I gotta warn you,
he developed a bit of eating disorder.

482
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:37,272
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whoop him back into shape.

483
00:59:41,693 --> 00:59:44,028
Come on, Fred, if you want to get
into shape, you gotta move, man.

484
00:59:44,112 --> 00:59:45,238
I told him he got to move.

485
00:59:50,493 --> 00:59:53,037
Fred Dukes? Trapped inside that creature?
That ain't Fred.

486
00:59:53,162 --> 00:59:55,289
If you want his help,
don't mention it, Logan.

487
00:59:56,749 --> 00:59:58,959
Hey, Fat, Fred, um.

488
00:59:59,626 --> 01:00:02,504
See, I remember that girl when
she's got 85 pounds, huh.

489
01:00:04,673 --> 01:00:07,613
Oh that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

490
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:10,344
You know where Victor is?

491
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:11,387
No idea.

492
01:00:11,512 --> 01:00:13,639
What's the island, slim?

493
01:00:15,558 --> 01:00:17,810
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

494
01:00:18,143 --> 01:00:20,062
Listen, I ain't gonna leave
until you tell me where Victor is.

495
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,272
Come on, Bob.
For old times' sake, huh?

496
01:00:24,483 --> 01:00:25,817
Did you just call me...

497
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:28,738
Blob?

498
01:00:29,737 --> 01:00:31,572
No, but...

499
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:40,039
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why did you call him Blob?

500
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:42,624
I didn't call him Blob, I said Bob!

501
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,418
Goddamn it!

502
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:46,253
I got an idea.

503
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:50,298
- This is your idea of an idea?
- Trying to help you out, Logan.

504
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:52,258
Dukes don't like you that much,
and you know it.

505
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:53,509
The feeling is mutual.

506
01:00:53,593 --> 01:00:56,012
Use those gloves, man,
dance with him a little bit.

507
01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:58,222
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

508
01:00:58,764 --> 01:01:01,600
I figure if you do that, he might
tell you everything you wanna know.

509
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,602
Come on, man, look at him.

510
01:01:03,727 --> 01:01:06,146
Big old ass comin' out of
the front of his shirt.

511
01:01:06,438 --> 01:01:09,024
Jesus, he's gonna have a coronary
for Christ's sake.

512
01:01:09,149 --> 01:01:11,735
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

513
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,738
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out on a stretcher.

514
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:17,240
You're an asshole.

515
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:21,369
Whoop his ass!

516
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:23,579
- Let me have it.
- If you want.

517
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:26,957
Be careful with this.
You wanna dance with me?

518
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:28,834
Oh. Oh, that feels good.

519
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:34,673
Hey, guess what?

520
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:38,301
See, he's gonna talk, man.
You got him right where you want him.

521
01:01:38,426 --> 01:01:39,927
Whose side are you on, anyway?

522
01:02:15,168 --> 01:02:17,170
Now, where is Victor?

523
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:50,701
A little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

524
01:03:06,466 --> 01:03:09,302
Please don't! Please! Don't, please!

525
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,012
Victor!

526
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:17,309
Where's Victor?

527
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:26,026
Victor's... with Stryker on...
on the island, they run it together.

528
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:29,154
What... what?

529
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:31,197
Victor's being with Stryker?

530
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:32,699
Yeah.

531
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:34,450
You didn't know that?

532
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:57,263
All that's left now is Logan, I...

533
01:03:57,346 --> 01:04:00,433
...trust you can handle that.

534
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:02,810
I did before, didn't I?

535
01:04:02,935 --> 01:04:05,229
Oh yes, you did that.

536
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:12,193
Our deal... it still applies, right?

537
01:04:13,528 --> 01:04:14,654
Of course.

538
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:17,365
Now pack him
and tag him, Captain.

539
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:27,583
What's the island?

540
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:32,712
It's where... Striker takes them
after Victor's caught 'em.

541
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:36,132
Wait, wait... um, what?
Takes who?

542
01:04:37,217 --> 01:04:39,093
Mutants.

543
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:44,223
The rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

544
01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:48,852
Well, you never wondered
what happened to them?

545
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:51,230
I tried not to.

546
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:11,790
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

547
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:16,420
They killed her for a
goddamn experiment.

548
01:05:20,674 --> 01:05:22,509
Where is it?

549
01:05:22,592 --> 01:05:25,428
Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

550
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:31,600
But...

551
01:05:32,226 --> 01:05:34,728
- A prisoner escaped there once.
- Who?

552
01:05:34,853 --> 01:05:35,771
His name is Remy LeBeau.

553
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:38,148
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

554
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,505
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

555
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:43,737
'cause he kept taking all their
money at poker, that's all I know.

556
01:05:43,862 --> 01:05:46,322
What's Stryker up to Fred,
what's the end game?

557
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:52,953
He's taking their powers,
trying to combine them somehow.

558
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,706
It's all I know, Logan.
It's all I know.

559
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:00,127
If I had to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

560
01:06:04,381 --> 01:06:05,924
I'm coming with you, Logan.

561
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,470
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

562
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,923
There's our dude.

563
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,139
That's cool.

564
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,808
But I'm gonna gonna go and cover
the back if he runs.

565
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,142
I'm not havin' a fight with him.

566
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,769
- Yeah right.
- What?

567
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:05,187
I am havin' fights with everybody?

568
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,272
Don't dogs kill cats?

569
01:07:07,397 --> 01:07:09,357
Just go cover the back, will ya?

570
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:24,622
Are you Remy LeBeau?

571
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:27,499
Do I owe you money?

572
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:28,959
No.

573
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:32,087
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

574
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:53,398
Large blind is 100,
and the small blind's 50.

575
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:56,151
May I deal you in?

576
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:58,445
Now what can I get for 17 bucks?

577
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:01,364
17 dollars?

578
01:08:02,073 --> 01:08:04,117
A cab ride home, perhaps.

579
01:08:08,704 --> 01:08:11,081
You're my brother's new babysitter, John?

580
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:14,084
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

581
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:15,961
And your creepy black
coat don't scare me.

582
01:08:16,044 --> 01:08:17,504
Really?

583
01:08:17,879 --> 01:08:19,297
It worked on Dukes.

584
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:23,426
What a shame, 'cause now I'm gonna kill you
so Logan never gets the chance.

585
01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:27,221
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

586
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:29,307
Victor Creed.

587
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:32,685
And who's that?

588
01:08:33,519 --> 01:08:35,687
The man I'm gonna kill.

589
01:08:37,064 --> 01:08:40,358
He works for a man named Stryker
on, uh, on an island.

590
01:08:41,276 --> 01:08:44,696
- I just need to know where it is.
- Why would you think I know that?

591
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,740
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

592
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:53,079
You are the guy who escaped and you are
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

593
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:56,707
You know, John...

594
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,834
There's something I always
wanted to tell you.

595
01:09:04,297 --> 01:09:06,758
You're predictable.

596
01:09:10,553 --> 01:09:13,097
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

597
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:16,976
That's funny.
I never knew you had one.

598
01:09:20,187 --> 01:09:23,982
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

599
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:28,194
The men who took me
wore tags just like 'em.

600
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:33,741
Hey, now Bob, you listen to me...

601
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:11,151
Two years I was rottin' in that hell,
and I'm never going back.

602
01:10:13,903 --> 01:10:16,489
Oh, shiny.

603
01:10:18,658 --> 01:10:20,660
Tell me something, Jimmy.

604
01:10:21,452 --> 01:10:23,662
Do you even know how to kill me?

605
01:10:23,788 --> 01:10:26,332
I'm gonna cut your goddamn head off.

606
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,168
See if that works.

607
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:40,511
You're gettin' slow, old man.

608
01:10:49,937 --> 01:10:52,272
Son of a bitch.

609
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:58,403
You're gonna die for
what you did to her.

610
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:24,052
Victor!

611
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:35,729
That's a nice stick.

612
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:36,744
Shithead. Here's the deal.

613
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:39,205
See, you're gonna take me to this
island, where I can kill Creed,

614
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,041
Stryker, pretty much everyone
you hate in this world.

615
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,959
Do you understand?

616
01:12:45,335 --> 01:12:46,712
You really want to kill 'em.

617
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,172
As long as you stay
out of my way, yeah.

618
01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:04,561
Colonel.

619
01:13:05,687 --> 01:13:06,772
General?

620
01:13:06,855 --> 01:13:09,274
Is this Weapon XI?

621
01:13:10,525 --> 01:13:13,653
All their strenghts
but none of their weaknesses.

622
01:13:13,737 --> 01:13:15,780
You really hate them, don't you?

623
01:13:16,114 --> 01:13:17,949
No, I don't hate them.

624
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:21,494
After 20 years of working with them,
I just know what they can do.

625
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:30,168
If we win this war before it starts,
and save countless lives in the process.

626
01:13:30,294 --> 01:13:33,380
Preemptive action is
the only action here, General.

627
01:13:33,922 --> 01:13:38,051
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

628
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:42,221
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

629
01:13:42,805 --> 01:13:45,683
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

630
01:13:46,475 --> 01:13:49,269
But this is as far as it goes.

631
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:51,813
Weapon X was a... a hickup.

632
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:53,649
We know about your son, Bill.

633
01:13:53,774 --> 01:13:55,484
We know he's a mutant.

634
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:58,695
And we know he killed your wife.
You shouldn't have kept that from us.

635
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:00,280
That...

636
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,951
- That has nothing to do with my work.
- Bullshit!

637
01:14:05,451 --> 01:14:08,662
You're too close to this.
I'm sure you know it.

638
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,501
You're right.
I...I won't lie to you.

639
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:22,467
My son did bring the problem home for me.

640
01:14:22,884 --> 01:14:25,470
But I took an oath...

641
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:29,015
to protect the American people

642
01:14:29,307 --> 01:14:31,475
from every threat,

643
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:33,435
both foreign

644
01:14:40,484 --> 01:14:42,110
...and domestic.

645
01:14:49,992 --> 01:14:51,994
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

646
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:53,329
Just concentrate on
what you're doing.

647
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:55,164
You sure? You got a bit of
sweat on your brow there.

648
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:58,333
- Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...
- On the what? Clouds?

649
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,961
We're jumpin' up and down
like a freakin' yoyo here.

650
01:15:00,962 --> 01:15:02,109
Where did you get this thing anyway?

651
01:15:02,212 --> 01:15:04,422
Oh, this is my baby,
I won her in a game.

652
01:15:04,506 --> 01:15:07,550
- Jacks over fives.
- Great.

653
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,220
Relax. We're almost there.

654
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:16,016
There it is....The island.

655
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:19,770
Three Mile Island.
Hiding in plain sight.

656
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:25,400
No one's gonna sneak around
a nuclear reactor.

657
01:15:25,525 --> 01:15:27,944
They think it's gonna turn them into freaks.

658
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:29,195
Like you?

659
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,947
Right.

660
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,158
All right, you ready?

661
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:35,785
Cause it's now or never.
Let's go.

662
01:15:35,868 --> 01:15:37,161
About time.

663
01:15:46,378 --> 01:15:49,464
Hey, if it's make you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

664
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:53,134
Oh yeah. It kind of does actually.

665
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,136
Good luck.

666
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:57,263
Likewise.

667
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:00,558
Oh shit.

668
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:08,649
How are you doing?

669
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:10,650
Is everything alright?

670
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:14,112
- Is he ready yet?
- A few hours.

671
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:16,531
He will respond to my commands?

672
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,533
Yes, Colonel.

673
01:17:21,049 --> 01:17:22,217
Logan.

674
01:17:23,551 --> 01:17:25,345
Welcome back to the war.

675
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:30,057
Before I gut you,
I wanna know why.

676
01:17:31,267 --> 01:17:33,602
I needed your powers
for the pool.

677
01:17:33,686 --> 01:17:35,354
For the what?

678
01:17:35,437 --> 01:17:38,649
A mutant killer.
The dead pool.

679
01:17:39,483 --> 01:17:43,236
Years of searching him, to find him,
finding the right powers

680
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:48,032
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart.

681
01:17:49,283 --> 01:17:52,995
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

682
01:17:53,788 --> 01:17:55,789
Logan, you are the last.

683
01:17:56,206 --> 01:17:57,958
You made Weapon XI possible.

684
01:17:59,459 --> 01:18:00,294
I...

685
01:18:00,794 --> 01:18:06,549
I asked you to help but...
you said you wanted the quiet life.

686
01:18:06,841 --> 01:18:07,634
Well...

687
01:18:08,718 --> 01:18:14,849
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

688
01:18:31,114 --> 01:18:32,865
Who are you?

689
01:18:33,616 --> 01:18:36,202
Oh she's a real old friend.

690
01:18:47,796 --> 01:18:49,881
Do you really think we'd
just let you walk away?

691
01:18:51,091 --> 01:18:53,593
You are a dangerous man.

692
01:18:53,801 --> 01:18:56,471
I like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

693
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:58,890
Tell him about the
day you died.

694
01:19:04,937 --> 01:19:08,190
They gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide.

695
01:19:10,275 --> 01:19:14,112
<i>It reduces the heart rate so low,
it appears you flatline.</i>

696
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:28,375
Don't be angry with her.

697
01:19:28,876 --> 01:19:32,254
Real credit...
to your species.

698
01:19:34,923 --> 01:19:39,010
Did you know that her sister
has diamond-hard skin?

699
01:19:39,135 --> 01:19:42,597
Kayla's mutation
is tacto-hypnosis.

700
01:19:42,722 --> 01:19:45,641
She can influence people as
long as she touches them.

701
01:19:45,766 --> 01:19:48,435
Quite a useful tool in the seduction.

702
01:19:48,644 --> 01:19:51,271
It was never real, my friend.

703
01:19:56,026 --> 01:19:58,236
It was real for me.

704
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:03,324
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you'd found.

705
01:20:10,748 --> 01:20:12,833
That story you told me...

706
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:16,336
about man who gets flowers for the moon...

707
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:20,423
I had it backwards.

708
01:20:22,467 --> 01:20:26,012
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

709
01:20:28,264 --> 01:20:31,434
But you were the Trickster, aren't you?

710
01:20:31,642 --> 01:20:34,186
I am just the fool that got played.

711
01:20:36,146 --> 01:20:39,691
The worst part of this is
I should have known.

712
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:44,863
But I ignored my instincts.

713
01:20:47,782 --> 01:20:50,785
I ignored what I really am.

714
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:57,958
Well, that will never happen again.

715
01:21:28,945 --> 01:21:31,072
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

716
01:21:31,156 --> 01:21:33,908
I have done everything you've asked.

717
01:21:35,076 --> 01:21:37,078
My sister...

718
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,955
You said that if I help you,
you'd let her go.

719
01:21:40,581 --> 01:21:42,499
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.

720
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:45,460
Her mutation is unique.
Quite beautiful.

721
01:21:45,586 --> 01:21:47,713
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

722
01:21:47,796 --> 01:21:48,797
You let him go?

723
01:21:52,634 --> 01:21:55,053
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

724
01:21:55,136 --> 01:21:57,513
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Give me the Adamantium.

725
01:21:57,638 --> 01:21:58,764
- Tests came out...
- We had a deal!

726
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:01,058
You would never survive the operation.

727
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:06,605
- I can take anything he can.
- No, you can't.

728
01:22:07,773 --> 01:22:08,940
You are my favorite soldier, Victor.

729
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,318
Be patient, time will come.

730
01:22:11,651 --> 01:22:12,694
He's using us!

731
01:22:21,786 --> 01:22:26,123
How about this time, you die for real?

732
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:28,083
Let me go.

733
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:33,380
Your mind game don't work on me.

734
01:22:33,797 --> 01:22:35,006
Victor!

735
01:23:09,246 --> 01:23:11,248
Feels good, doesn't it?

736
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,626
All that rage...

737
01:23:15,836 --> 01:23:17,421
Do it.

738
01:23:17,504 --> 01:23:19,047
Logan!

739
01:23:20,131 --> 01:23:21,257
You're not an animal.

740
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,260
Oh yes, you are.

741
01:23:27,763 --> 01:23:28,973
Do it.

742
01:23:32,977 --> 01:23:35,145
Finish it.

743
01:23:59,209 --> 01:24:00,002
Logan?

744
01:24:03,797 --> 01:24:05,507
My sister.

745
01:24:05,715 --> 01:24:07,133
They have my sister.

746
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:10,887
Please, I didn't trick you
into believing me.

747
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,181
It was real for me too.

748
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:18,519
Please, I'm so sorry.

749
01:24:18,602 --> 01:24:21,105
They have my sister.

750
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:23,148
Where is she?

751
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:31,406
- Activate Weapon XI.
- The binding process is incomplete.

752
01:24:31,489 --> 01:24:32,407
Just do it!

753
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,408
Now!

754
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,800
Are you okay?
Come on.

755
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,953
Okay...

756
01:26:31,467 --> 01:26:32,760
Perfect.

757
01:26:33,052 --> 01:26:34,553
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

758
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:36,972
Find another way out.

759
01:26:37,055 --> 01:26:38,974
Come on, let's go!

760
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:41,977
Wade, is that you?

761
01:26:45,647 --> 01:26:48,858
I guess Stryker finally figured
out how to shut you up.

762
01:26:59,618 --> 01:27:00,410
Wade...

763
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:03,455
You don't have to do this.

764
01:27:04,873 --> 01:27:06,124
Alright, maybe you do.

765
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,055
Shoot on sight!

766
01:27:30,563 --> 01:27:32,148
I can help! Point me at 'em!

767
01:27:32,482 --> 01:27:33,399
Go!

768
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:43,075
Go! Now!

769
01:27:49,873 --> 01:27:51,416
Did I get them?

770
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:52,625
Yeah.

771
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:03,636
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

772
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:04,887
Kayla, come on!

773
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:06,263
I have to stay here.

774
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:08,932
You take them.

775
01:28:09,328 --> 01:28:10,121
Go!

776
01:28:11,351 --> 01:28:12,143
Go!

777
01:28:39,976 --> 01:28:41,018
<i>Go left.</i>

778
01:28:41,295 --> 01:28:42,088
Left.

779
01:28:43,422 --> 01:28:45,174
- What?
- We go left.

780
01:28:45,257 --> 01:28:47,343
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

781
01:29:01,272 --> 01:29:03,441
C'mon Bob! Let's see
your dance up here.

782
01:29:40,476 --> 01:29:42,145
Nobody kills you but me.

783
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:52,362
Back-to-back!

784
01:29:55,177 --> 01:29:56,679
- I got him!
- Oh no, you don't.

785
01:31:32,372 --> 01:31:33,164
Stop!

786
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:35,249
- This can't be the way.
- This is the way!

787
01:31:35,374 --> 01:31:37,001
- How do you know?
- I just know.

788
01:31:37,418 --> 01:31:38,210
Come on.

789
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:50,639
Adamantium bullets.

790
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:55,310
Let's see him heal with a few
of these through his thick skull.

791
01:31:55,393 --> 01:31:57,895
You can't stop him.
Even with that.

792
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,230
He'll heal.

793
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,482
His brain may heal.

794
01:32:02,816 --> 01:32:05,569
But his memories won't grow back.

795
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:24,879
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

796
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:27,715
We're done.

797
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,300
We can never be done, Jimmy.

798
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:32,302
We're brothers.

799
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,930
Brothers look out for each other.

800
01:33:08,294 --> 01:33:10,129
- You miss me?
- Jesus...

801
01:33:12,256 --> 01:33:16,593
When you said you'd gonna kill everyone,
I thought you may just've been exaggerating.

802
01:33:17,094 --> 01:33:17,886
Yeah...

803
01:33:19,262 --> 01:33:21,056
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

804
01:33:21,598 --> 01:33:22,557
You're welcome.

805
01:33:31,315 --> 01:33:32,691
These kids trying
to get off the island.

806
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,234
- Split up. Go!
- I'm on it.

807
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:44,533
Kayla!

808
01:33:45,543 --> 01:33:46,585
Kayla!

809
01:33:55,629 --> 01:33:57,673
I love you.

810
01:34:05,221 --> 01:34:06,139
No...

811
01:34:09,726 --> 01:34:11,227
I am so cold.

812
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:14,230
Listen to me, I'm gonna
get you outta here.

813
01:34:14,313 --> 01:34:15,189
You understand?

814
01:34:16,148 --> 01:34:17,274
Let's go easy, nice and easy.

815
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:18,442
That's it.

816
01:34:18,609 --> 01:34:19,401
That's it.

817
01:34:22,779 --> 01:34:24,573
I'm gonna get you out.

818
01:34:47,593 --> 01:34:48,935
Logan!

819
01:35:44,914 --> 01:35:47,024
I should make you
pull the trigger.

820
01:35:48,192 --> 01:35:50,402
But that would make us
not better than you.

821
01:35:52,196 --> 01:35:53,989
Throw the gun away.

822
01:35:57,885 --> 01:36:01,487
Turn around...Walk until your feet bleed.

823
01:36:02,497 --> 01:36:04,082
And then keep walking.

824
01:36:42,033 --> 01:36:44,327
<i>It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

825
01:36:44,411 --> 01:36:46,663
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

826
01:36:46,788 --> 01:36:48,956
<i>I'm a mutant, like you.</i>

827
01:36:49,082 --> 01:36:53,544
<i>- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes. And I can hear yours.</i>

828
01:36:53,753 --> 01:36:55,963
You're safe now.

829
01:36:56,088 --> 01:36:58,257
<i>Come. We have to go.</i>

830
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:48,407
The kids are safe.

831
01:37:54,288 --> 01:37:55,497
Damn

832
01:37:59,084 --> 01:38:02,045
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

833
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,714
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

834
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:08,134
Where the hell am I?

835
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:10,720
Listen to me, I am a friend.

836
01:38:10,928 --> 01:38:12,138
I'm a friend.

837
01:38:12,221 --> 01:38:13,722
What's my name?

838
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:15,266
What's my name!

839
01:38:15,474 --> 01:38:17,684
Your name is Logan.

840
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,648
You need to trust me.
We have to go.

841
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:30,822
Follow me.

842
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:36,994
Now!

843
01:39:10,942 --> 01:39:12,652
Do you know her?

844
01:39:16,447 --> 01:39:17,448
No.

845
01:39:22,578 --> 01:39:24,538
These dudes are not gonna like
what you've done in this place.

846
01:39:24,621 --> 01:39:26,957
We really need to go.

847
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,126
I'll find my own way.

848
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,173
Good luck.

849
01:41:06,716 --> 01:41:08,718
Colonel Stryker?

850
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:16,029
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

851
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:21,576
You're wanted for questioning in
connection of the death of General Munson.

852
01:41:21,577 --> 01:41:22,619
Sir.
