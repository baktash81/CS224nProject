1
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:30,143
Ha-ha!

2
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,939
Yeah, my man!

3
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,610
All right!

4
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:41,988
I wanna tell you a story.

5
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:45,158
Every man oughta know.

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,161
If you want a little lovin'

7
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:50,789
You gotta start real slow.

8
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:54,042
She's gonna love you tonight now.

9
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,170
If you just treat her right now.

10
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,589
Oh, squeeze her real gentle.

11
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,968
You gotta make her feel good.

12
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:05,887
Tell her that you love her.

13
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:08,306
Like you know you should.

14
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:11,935
Cos if you don't treat her right now.

15
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,604
She won't love you tonight now.

16
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:17,732
If you practise my method.

17
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,527
Just as hard as you can.

18
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:23,446
You're gonna get a reputation.

19
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:26,533
As a lovin' man now.

20
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,286
And you'll be glad every night.

21
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:32,247
That you treated her right.

22
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:34,875
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,542
Hey!

24
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:37,836
Hey!

25
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:39,504
Hey!

26
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,089
All right!

27
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:59,316
In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia.

28
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:05,363
Down in the dark of a Cumberland mine.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,303
Tell us about the early days, Jimmy.
How did it all begin?

30
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:33,642
Well, Terry, I was always in the music
business, but more on the sales side.

31
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:34,767
Fuck off.

32
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't want your kisses.

33
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:41,066
That's for sure.

34
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:46,238
I die each time.

35
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:49,824
I hear this sound:

36
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:54,955
Here he comes.

37
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:58,208
That's Cathy's clown.

38
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,296
Here he comes.

39
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:06,091
That's Cathy's clown.

40
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,475
Dearest.

41
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,602
Darlin'

42
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:22,190
I have to write to say
that I won't be home.

43
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,567
Any more.

44
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:26,236
Cos something happened.

45
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,738
To me.

46
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,740
While I was drivin' home.

47
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,909
And I'm not the same.

48
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,703
Any more.

49
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:37,080
Oh, I was only.

50
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:42,711
Twenty-four hours from Tulsa.

51
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,754
Only.

52
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:49,301
One day away from your arms.

53
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,013
I saw a welcoming light.

54
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,224
And I had to stop for the night.

55
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,854
Said to the man at the railroad station

56
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:02,314
I want a ticket.

57
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:04,774
Just for one.

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,737
He said: Well, if you insist.

59
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:11,489
Where you wanna go, miss?

60
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,158
Oh-oh.

61
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,535
Destination anywhere.

62
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:20,332
- Jimmy! Jimmy! You got the video?
- Yeah. Mississippi Burning, wasn't it?

63
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,252
Have you got any Hothouse Flowers?

64
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:30,008
And this old world ain't got
no back door.

65
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,385
Because I saw her today

66
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,095
I saw her face.

67
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:35,805
It was a face I loved.

68
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:38,058
And I knew

69
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,185
I had to run away-ay.

70
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,146
And get down on my knees and pray-ay.

71
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,856
That they'd go away.

72
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,983
But still they begin.

73
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,946
Those needles and pins, yeah.

74
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,199
Because of all my pride.

75
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,702
The tears I gotta hide.

76
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,454
Right now-yeah!

77
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,040
Needles and pins, yeah.

78
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,544
Needles and pins, yeah.

79
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,214
Needles and pins.

80
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:14,344
Needles and pins,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,805
Yeah-yeah!

82
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,849
Ye-e-e-eah!

83
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,149
We'll take a short break here,
but we'll be back,

84
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,068
so stay in the groove.

85
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:38,326
- Imelda, you're lookin' deadly!
- What are you doin' here?

86
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:41,246
- Friend of the band's.
- You're sure no friend o' me sister's!

87
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,540
The fella she's marrying
hardly knows her.

88
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:44,708
Cheeky bastard!

89
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,586
- You'll be next.
- Why me? I'm not bleedin' pregnant!

90
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,713
- Imelda.
- See yeh, Jimmy.

91
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,846
Fuck off!

92
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:01,975
Well, I'm three months gone.
It's a bit tight.

93
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:04,895
- Oh, I can feel it!
- You can feel it already?

94
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:07,647
That's great! Can you feel it?

95
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,778
- Why d'yeh want me to manage yis?
- Cos you know all about music, Jimmy.

96
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:16,823
You had Frankie Goes To Hollywood's
album before anyone else.

97
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:20,994
- You were first to realise they were shite.
- What's shite is what yous were playin'.

98
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:24,414
- We have to play that at weddings.
- What d'yeh call yourselves?

99
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,792
- And And And.
- And And fuckin' And?

100
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,921
Ray is thinkin' of an exclamation mark
after the second And.

101
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:34,132
- He says it'll look deadly on the posters.
- Yeh don't like it?

102
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:38,887
- D'yeh think it should go at the end?
- I think it should go up his arse.

103
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,639
We're not married to it.

104
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:41,723
Aah, no.

105
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:43,892
Dance, yeh bastard!

106
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,062
I've looked at the ocean.

107
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,105
Tried hard to imagine.

108
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,066
The way you felt the day you sailed.

109
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:53,818
From Wester Ross to Nova Scotia!

110
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,946
We should have helped you.

111
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,572
We should have told you.

112
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:01,826
- Look at that eejit!
- That eejit's singin' somethin' like music.

113
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:04,412
Jimmy, we need direction.

114
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:07,165
If I'm the manager, Ray's not in the band.

115
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,626
- Why not?
- I don't like him. I never have.

116
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,629
- I hate him, to be honest with yeh.
- But he owns the synth.

117
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,257
No one uses synths any more.
It's back to basics.

118
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,259
Just as well, cos we've fuck-all else.

119
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:18,969
Railtrack.

120
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,096
From Miami to...

121
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:26,935
Jaysis!

122
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:30,939
- What the fuck is tha'?
- It's me hanky.

123
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,608
- Here yeh are, lmelda.
- Thanks.

124
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,236
What are yous lookin' at?

125
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:37,779
Nothin'.

126
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,325
- I'll have this washed for yeh, Jimmy.
- That's OK.

127
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:45,245
Wash it? I'd fuckin' frame it!

128
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:50,625
What does she see in him? He looks like
he models fuckin' knittin' patterns!

129
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,879
- Mothers love him.
- Why? He's a prick!

130
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:56,965
He's a prick with a job.

131
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:00,010
That band, Free Beer.
They always pull a big crowd.

132
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,762
- I like A Flock of Budgies.
- That's a stupid name.

133
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,724
It's better than bleedin' yours:
Cosmic Lino.

134
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:10,437
It has to be "The" something. All the best
Sixties bands were "The" somethings.

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,690
- We could be The Northsiders.
- Or The Liffey Lads?

136
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,234
How about The Fuckin' Eejits?

137
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:19,779
What kind of music are we
goin' to be playin', Jimmy?

138
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:23,200
- You're workin' class, right?
- Yeah, if there was any work.

139
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:26,578
Your music should be about
where you're from.

140
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,830
It should speak
the language of the streets.

141
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,916
It should be about struggle and sex.

142
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,920
And I don't mean mushy shite about
I'll love you till the end o' time.

143
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:39,341
I mean ridin', fuckin', tongues,
gooters, boxes. The works!

144
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:42,177
Jaysis! What kind of music says all that?

145
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,428
Soul.

146
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:44,553
Soul?

147
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,766
Soul! We're goin' to be
playing Dublin soul.

148
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:49,601
Dublin soul.

149
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,770
Fuckin' deadly!

150
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,273
Dublin soul, wha'?

151
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,526
Jimmy!

152
00:08:58,568 --> 00:08:59,736
Dublin soul!

153
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:02,697
In a window pane.

154
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:05,158
Do you remember.

155
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,121
How sweet it used to be?

156
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:17,712
When we was together.

157
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,759
Everything was so... grand.

158
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:24,845
Now.

159
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:29,057
Now that we've parted.

160
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:31,726
You know there's one thing.

161
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:34,563
That I just can't stand

162
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,690
I can't stand the rain.

163
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,404
- Are you Mr Rabbitte?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:45,490
- I've come about the ad.
- What ad?

165
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:47,868
The one in the paper.

166
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,830
"Have you got soul? If so..."

167
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,877
Yeh have the wrong Rabbitte!

168
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:02,382
Can I have me paper back?

169
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:04,259
Fuck off!

170
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:09,848
Jimmy, I've more things to be doin'
than ironing shirts for you every day!

171
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:13,059
- What's this?
- What's what?

172
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:17,272
"Have you got soul? If so, the world's
hardest-working band is looking for you."

173
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:22,235
"Contact J Rabbitte. Rednecks and
southsiders need not apply."

174
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,239
- World's hardest-working band(!)
- Was that someone about it?

175
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:29,326
- Where are you goin'? Finish your dinner.
- Out.

176
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:31,870
- Can I borrow your hairdryer?
- Go and shite!

177
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:35,332
- And leave my aftershave alone.
- Who was that at the door?

178
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,876
Some snotty-nosed fella
with a mouth organ.

179
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:41,338
- Yeh put an ad in the paper?
- I'm puttin' a band together.

180
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,381
D'yeh need a singer?

181
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:48,136
Wise men say.

182
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,351
Only fools rush in.

183
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:59,189
But I can't help.

184
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:02,359
Falling in love.

185
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:05,028
With you.

186
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:10,158
- Like the river flows...
- Elvis is not soul.

187
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,993
Elvis is God!

188
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:14,538
I never pictured God
with a fat gut in a corset

189
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:16,915
singing "My Way" at Caesar's Palace!

190
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,834
Don't upset your father.

191
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:27,759
- Who are your influences?
- Uh... Barry Manilow.

192
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,890
- Who are your influences?
- Joan Baez... Joni Mitchell...

193
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:35,851
Wings...

194
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,561
Bachman Turner Overdrive?

195
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:39,855
Spandau Ballet. Soft Cell.

196
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,064
Sinéad O'Connor.

197
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,943
It's a nice trip to a candy shop...

198
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,196
Hi, I've come about the audition.

199
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,322
Led Zeppelin.

200
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:50,782
Uh...

201
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,158
Billy and The Bollix.

202
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,535
U2?

203
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,879
Well, the black folks are starvin'

204
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:09,342
And the white trash is carpin'

205
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:17,426
And the KKK's all over the TV.

206
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:23,231
Blood on the mirror,
and there was blood on your face!

207
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,626
Look so good

208
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,253
I've really done my best.

209
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:47,797
Powder, paint and lipstick.

210
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:50,634
The latest Paris dress.

211
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:55,222
Poppa, rumba, rumba,
hey, Poppa Joe, coconuts.

212
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,015
Poppa Joe, hey, Poppa Joe.

213
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,184
Yeah, hey... Poppa Joe.

214
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,436
Why didn't you tell me
you were bored!

215
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,605
Why didn't you tell me
you were bored!

216
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:29,256
And still I dream he'll come to me.

217
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,801
That we will live the years together.

218
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:36,346
But there are dreams that cannot be.

219
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,683
In the haze of a drunken hour.

220
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:43,395
- But heaven knows I'm miserable now.
- Yeah, I know how yeh feel.

221
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,858
Elvis was a Cajun.

222
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,986
He had a Cajun heart.

223
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,865
Had to move down to Memphis.

224
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:59,494
- Cos that's where he got his start.
- Fuckin' blasphemy! Elvis wasn't a Cajun!

225
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,122
All that time in Graceland
and in Vegas, where he got huge.

226
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:04,457
What d'yeh play?

227
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,128
I used to play football at school.

228
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,505
I mean what instrument?

229
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,674
I don't.

230
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,260
So what are yeh doin' here?

231
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:20,056
Well, I saw everybody else linin' up,
so... I thought yeh were sellin' drugs.

232
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,857
Hey, lads. This is Dean Fay.

233
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:31,443
Howayeh? Outspan Foster.

234
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:33,403
Derek Scully.

235
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:37,240
His influences are Clarence Clemons
and the guy from Madness.

236
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,784
- That's a nice sax.
- I haven't had it long.

237
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,454
Me uncle gave it to me
when his lung collapsed.

238
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:45,207
- This the band, is it?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,210
Bet U2 are shittin' themselves.

240
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:51,796
- Still got blue suede shoes, Mr Rabbitte?
- Fuck off, carrot-head!

241
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,133
Who's sorry now?

242
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,345
Who's sorry now?

243
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,805
Any chance for me, lads?

244
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:05,185
In your wildest dreams, Jimmy,
did yeh ever think you'd be this big?

245
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:08,688
To be honest, Terry, I did.
Even in the early days.

246
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,275
As big as The Rolling Stones?

247
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,611
Who the fuck are they, Terry?

248
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,031
- Who's in there with yeh?
- I'm being interviewed on television!

249
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:22,869
It's Colonel Jimmy Rabbitte now, wha'?
Interviewed on television!

250
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:25,038
He's interviewing himself!

251
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:28,583
- Yeah?
- Jimmy, there's another one.

252
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,797
Yeah?

253
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:35,924
- I saw the ad.
- Did yeh?

254
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:39,261
- Yeah. I'm a singer.
- Is that right? Let's hear yeh, then.

255
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,304
- Here?
- Yeah.

256
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,640
- Can I come inside?
- No.

257
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,767
- In the hall, even?
- No.

258
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,479
I can't sing. Not out here.

259
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:51,940
Fair enough. See yeh.

260
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,024
OK. Thanks.

261
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,193
Only the lonely.

262
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:00,824
Know the way I feel tonight.

263
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:06,788
Only the lonely.

264
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:12,252
Know this feeling ain't right.

265
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:16,715
I can't play for yis cos me drum kit's
in the pawnshop. But I'm good.

266
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
- Who are your influences?
- Animal in the Muppets.

267
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,719
Animal!

268
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,012
Jaysis!

269
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,389
- I used to play in a band.
- What did they do?

270
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:27,934
- Depeche Mode. Aztec Camera.
- Fuckin' art-school stuff.

271
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,646
- The Beatles went to art school.
- So did Roxy Music, and you liked them.

272
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:37,277
It's who it's aimed at. Wankers with funny
haircuts and rich dads with fuck-all to do.

273
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,946
That sounds like me arse.

274
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,365
But I'm sure you're right, Jimmy.

275
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,870
- Me boss has a truck I can get the use of.
- Could be handy, Billy.

276
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:48,830
Might help till we get a tour bus.

277
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:51,208
Hey! There's lmelda Quirke!

278
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,836
Fuck! Do you know her?

279
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,214
- Yeah.
- She was in our school.

280
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:01,760
- Oh, look at that body! She is beautiful!
- She's a little ride, isn't she?

281
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:05,555
Yeh'd think she'd be in a cocktail bar
sippin' drinks with umbrellas.

282
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,098
She's almost too perfect.

283
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:10,268
You mean you'd stand a chance
if she had bandy legs and a hump?

284
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:14,147
When this band's happenin',
you'll be fightin' women off.

285
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,107
Ohh! Rock'n'roll!

286
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:19,611
- You won't get that with And And And.
- We told Ray we left the band.

287
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,571
- How did he take it?
- Not too bad.

288
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:25,534
- He said he was goin' solo.
- Doesn't have much bleedin' choice!

289
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,796
- Howyeh, Bernie.
- Howayeh, Jimmy?

290
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:39,339
- How's things?
- Shite.

291
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,550
Gis a bag o' chips, will yeh?

292
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,511
I like the hair. Are yeh growing out
the Sinéad O'Connor?

293
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,012
Fuck off!

294
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,598
- D'yeh wanna be in a band?
- Wha'?

295
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:51,059
- Back-up singer, like.
- Me?

296
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:54,813
Why not? You used to sing
in the church choir. Lovely voice!

297
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:57,023
Fuck off! D'yeh want salt an' vinegar?

298
00:17:57,148 --> 00:18:00,902
I'm serious. On the Bible. I'm puttin'
a band together. I need singers.

299
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,612
I'll think about it.

300
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:04,990
- How much is that?
- 50p.

301
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,616
Thanks.

302
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,411
Are you still friendly
with that, uh... Imelda?

303
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:10,495
Imelda Quirke?

304
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,248
Imelda Quirke. Will you ask her as well?

305
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:14,331
Yeah.

306
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,293
Thanks. See yeh.

307
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:19,796
Jimmy? Me friend Natalie's
got a great voice.

308
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,632
Good. Bring her.
But don't forget lmelda.

309
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,428
- OK. See yeh, Jimmy.
- See yeh.

310
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:30,098
What the fuck do they want lmelda Quirke
for? Fuckin' tits and arse-that's it.

311
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,715
Anyone sittin' here?

312
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:06,426
Doesn't look like it.

313
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:09,471
- How's the soup?
- Poxy.

314
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,557
- Anything worth eatin'?
- It's all poxy.

315
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:18,021
Me name's Jimmy Rabbitte. I'm puttin'
a band together. I need a singer.

316
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:19,022
Me?

317
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:22,025
Yeah! I heard yeh.
You've a rare pair o' lungs.

318
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,861
- Where'd yeh hear me singin'?
- The Quirke wedding.

319
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,489
I was pissed out o' me brains.
I had 14 rum an' blacks.

320
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:30,408
- You got up and sang.
- I did?

321
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:33,078
No one told me.

322
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,556
Hey, you!

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,183
Hey, you!

324
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,352
Hey!

325
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,771
That's enough!

326
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,733
Had to see if he could play before I paid.
I'll be back at the end o' the month.

327
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,236
- That's what they all say.
- I will!

328
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,864
It's me ma's.
She thinks I'm havin' it cleaned.

329
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,326
Oi! Ginger!

330
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,787
Shut the fuck up, will yeh!

331
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:17,914
I... I... I...

332
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:19,416
I

333
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,667
I

334
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:21,876
I

335
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,253
I

336
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:24,628
I

337
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,340
I can feel.

338
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:31,011
Love.

339
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,181
I love you so.

340
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:38,351
- Can you sing that sort o' stuff?
- I can sing anythin'.

341
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:42,105
It's not the singin'. It's how he does it.
The showmanship.

342
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,065
Brilliant!

343
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,819
I'm not doin' that! I'd kneecap meself!

344
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,031
He's hurt, look. They're helpin' him off.

345
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,493
What'll they do now?
Bring on a substitute?

346
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:57,287
It's the act, lads. Watch.

347
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,915
- Five minutes, Jimmy.
- How are you, gorgeous?

348
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:01,625
Go an' shite!

349
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,756
That's what you've got to
measure up to, lads.

350
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,883
D'yeh not think, uh...

351
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,551
What?

352
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:16,097
Well, like... maybe we're
a little white for that kind o' thing.

353
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,974
D'yeh not get it, lads?

354
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:23,563
The Irish are the blacks of Europe.
And Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland.

355
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,816
And the northside Dubliners
are the blacks of Dublin.

356
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,737
So say it once, say it loud:
I'm black an' I'm proud!

357
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:47,462
Now I know it's wrong.

358
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:51,508
The things I ask you to do.

359
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,222
But please believe me, darlin'

360
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,225
I don't mean to hurt you.

361
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,938
But could you slip away.

362
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:09,609
Without him knowin' you're gone?

363
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:14,406
Could you meet me somewhere?

364
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:25,125
Take my hand.

365
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:30,672
You must be gettin' desperate. Wait till
you see the little bollix askin' for yeh.

366
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:35,093
Take my whole life too.

367
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:36,887
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

368
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,555
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

369
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,390
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

370
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:42,475
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

371
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:46,897
Yeah?

372
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:50,275
God bless you, Brother Rabbitte.
Your band need a trumpet?

373
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,027
You're the same age as me da!

374
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,156
You may speak the truth.
But I'm 16 years younger than BB King.

375
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,909
- You've heard of BB King?
- I jammed with the man.

376
00:22:58,992 --> 00:22:59,826
Piss off!

377
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:04,414
Leicester Mecca, 1972. Didn't give it me
best, though. Had a bit of a head cold.

378
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,833
What's your name, pal?

379
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,877
Joseph Fagan.

380
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,379
Joey "The Lips" Fagan.

381
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:13,673
And I'm Jimmy "The Bollix" Rabbitte!

382
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:17,761
I earned me name for me horn playin'.
What did you earn yours for?

383
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:21,181
- Don't get snotty with me, son.
- I get snotty with no man.

384
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:24,476
- You played with BB King?
- Among others, brother.

385
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:27,145
- Like?
- Have we got all day?

386
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,981
Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Martha Reeves.

387
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,149
Sam Cooke.

388
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:32,526
Poor Sam.

389
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:35,820
Otis Redding. May the Lord
have mercy on his sweet soul.

390
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:39,032
Joe Tex. The Four Tops. Stevie Wonder.

391
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:41,409
He was only 11. A pup.

392
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:43,703
- Wilson Pickett...
- Why are yeh in Dublin?

393
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,290
I'm tired of the road.
And me mammy isn't very well.

394
00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:51,086
- Why would yeh want to join us?
- The Lord sent me

395
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:53,672
and the Lord blows my trumpet.

396
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,850
- What did Evel Knievel want?
- God sent him.

397
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:07,102
- What?
- God sent him.

398
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:09,479
On a fuckin' Suzuki?

399
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:44,472
Jaysis!

400
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:46,808
He can play. That's for sure.

401
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:50,437
- The Lord doesn't like it if we whisper.
- Why? Is he deaf?

402
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:53,982
I didn't join this band to sing
Moon fuckin' River.

403
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:57,194
It's merely my favourite lip-loosener.

404
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,321
We'll be playin' soul.

405
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:04,284
See, the Lord told me the Irish brothers
needed some soul. Well, Ed Winchell,

406
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:07,495
a Baptist reverend on Lenox Avenue
in Harlem, told me.

407
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:10,707
But the Lord told him to tell me.

408
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,754
He said the Irish brothers wouldn't be
shootin' the arses off each other

409
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,340
if they had... soul.

410
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:24,888
I can't figure him out, Jimmy. He talks
like a priest and he's wearin' slippers!

411
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,599
He's played with all the greats.
Even The Beatles.

412
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:29,142
- The Beatles?
- Yeah.

413
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:31,102
All you need is love!

414
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:32,437
Da-da-da-da-da!

415
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:33,730
That was Joey.

416
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:37,609
- What's Steven Clifford doin' here? He's...
- What?

417
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:40,237
A medical student.
He's not like the rest of us.

418
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,990
Could be useful to have someone
that could bandage heads.

419
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,785
I'm worried about
the direction we're takin'.

420
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:50,539
Direction?! What magazines
you been readin', yeh tosser?

421
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:53,416
Look, with Joey and me,
we can touch greatness.

422
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,463
So if you want to be part of it, take in
the tea, and I'll bring in the Jaffa Cakes.

423
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:02,968
- It's the fuckin' Addams Family!
- The Addams Family!

424
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,887
Hold on, girls.
I think I've got a ladder in me tights.

425
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:08,640
Imelda! Come on!

426
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:13,186
Who the fuck will be lookin' at
your fuckin' thigh, yeh fuckin' eejit!

427
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:19,109
- Look at the size of that fuckin' doorknob!
- Fuckin' huge!

428
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:22,946
I hope some o' these fuckin' fellas
are gonna be rides.

429
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:27,367
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- I've never been here before!

430
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,954
- Who told yeh? It was Jimmy, was it?
- Fuck, I don't know.

431
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,878
Um... sorry. We were lookin' for a band.

432
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:41,506
Oh! That's my boy Joey's.
They're out the back.

433
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:56,813
Joey says no rehearsals till you get
friendly with your instruments.

434
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:59,816
- Friendly with mine already.
- Shut up, Declan.

435
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,070
Deco. If I'm gonna front the band,
I like the sound o' Deco.

436
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:07,908
Deco the bus conductor.
Is that top Deco or bottom Deco?

437
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:12,537
The only bollixin' thing that's important
is what this band's called.

438
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:14,706
Joey knows. Tell them.

439
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:17,834
We are...

440
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,337
We are...

441
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:24,090
At the end of the garden
you'll find a ladder.

442
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:25,884
- A ladder?
- Yes.

443
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,595
- Right. Thank you.
- You're welcome, girls.

444
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:33,391
- What are yeh gettin' us into, Bernie?
- Fuck off, Natalie! We've come this far!

445
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:39,314
Over here?

446
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:41,525
Over the top! Over the top!

447
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:45,237
I'm not goin' over the fuckin' ladder!
You're over the fuckin' ladder!

448
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,616
You know 'em. You go.

449
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,243
The Commitments?

450
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:52,953
- The Commitments?
- The Commitments?

451
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,248
It's a "The".

452
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,126
How do you spell it?

453
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,545
T-H-E.

454
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:03,922
It's very good. It's a statement.

455
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:07,259
- I still like A Flock of Budgies.
- Fuck me!

456
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:10,595
I just seen lmelda Quirke's arse
comin' down a ladder!

457
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:24,818
Lads, you're lookin' at
The Commitmentettes.

458
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:27,529
The Commitment-tits, yeh mean!

459
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:30,490
Brilliant management, Brother Rabbitte.

460
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,034
Will they be dressed in black?

461
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:38,707
What are you bleedin' lookin' at?

462
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:45,380
Destination anywhere.

463
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:50,468
East or west, I don't care.

464
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:53,680
Destination anywhere.

465
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:57,976
East or west, I don't care.

466
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,938
Destination anywhere.

467
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:05,692
East or west, I don't care.

468
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:09,738
Destination anywhere.

469
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,908
East or west, I don't care.

470
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:17,204
From now on, I don't want you listenin'
to Guns N' Roses an' The Soup Dragons.

471
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:21,333
I want a strict diet of James Brown for
the growls, Otis Redding for the moans,

472
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:25,253
Smokey Robinson for the whines,
and Aretha for the whole lot put together.

473
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:27,797
- Jimmy says soul is sex.
- Dirty bastard!

474
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:30,509
I said the rhythm of soul
is the rhythm of ridin'.

475
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:33,553
You want us to sing as if
we were ridin'with someone?

476
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,597
You can practise with me.

477
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:38,725
I'd bite your bollix off, yeh spotty fuck!

478
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:42,145
- Might fancy that.
- Or make earrings out o' them!

479
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,106
Soul is the rhythm of sex.
Rhythm of the factory, too.

480
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,567
The working man's rhythm.
Sex and the factory.

481
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:51,363
Not in the factory I'm in.
Not much rhythm in guttin' fish!

482
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:55,534
Soul is the music that people understand.
It's basic and it's simple.

483
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:59,913
But it's somethin' else. Somethin' special.
Cos... cos it's honest.

484
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:02,541
It's honest. There's no fuckin' bullshit.

485
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:05,252
It says it straight from the heart.

486
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:09,172
There's lots of music yeh can get off on,
but... soul is more than that.

487
00:30:09,256 --> 00:30:14,386
It takes yeh somewhere else. It grabs you
by the balls and lifts you above the shite.

488
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:20,308
Said to the man at the railroad station.

489
00:30:20,976 --> 00:30:22,686
I want a ticket.

490
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,396
Just for one.

491
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:28,275
He said: Well, if you insist.

492
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:31,403
But where you wanna go, miss?

493
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:33,154
Oh-oh.

494
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:36,741
Destination anywhere.

495
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:40,829
East or west, I don't care.

496
00:30:41,246 --> 00:30:44,749
You see, my baby don't
want me no more.

497
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,669
And this old world ain't got.

498
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,213
No back door.

499
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,389
Howayeh, Duffy?

500
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:42,891
This is Jimmy.

501
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:44,893
Howayeh?

502
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:51,733
- Glad that dog's got a muzzle.
- Have to. He keeps eatin' me bunnies.

503
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,112
- So you've got a band?
- Yeah.

504
00:31:56,238 --> 00:32:00,700
I don't know why you bother. Everything's
shite since Roy Orbison died.

505
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:04,204
- What are yeh short of?
- I need a power amp, speakers, a desk,

506
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:05,997
an' a few bits and pieces.

507
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:08,124
It's all here in the... note.

508
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:12,462
That's no problem. How are yeh payin'?

509
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:15,674
I can give you 50 now,
some when we get the gear,

510
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,676
an' the rest when we do our first gig.

511
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,513
Most bands in Dublin don't last
more than one gig, son.

512
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:24,933
- D'yeh need anythin' else? Bit o' blow?
- No.

513
00:32:25,016 --> 00:32:30,063
Oh, me ma would like one o' those things
that wakes you up with a cup o' tea.

514
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:37,612
Nowhere to run to, baby.

515
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,823
Nowhere to hide.

516
00:32:41,283 --> 00:32:44,452
Got nowhere to run to, baby.

517
00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:47,289
Nowhere to hide.

518
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:51,793
It's not love I'm runnin' from.

519
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:55,005
Just the heartbreak I know will come.

520
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:58,466
Cos I know you're no good for me

521
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:01,970
I'm black an' I'm proud.

522
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:04,097
Everywhere I go.

523
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:05,765
Your face I see.

524
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,893
Every step I take.

525
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:10,687
You take with me, yeah.

526
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:13,690
Each night as I sleep.

527
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:15,317
Into my heart.

528
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,319
You creep

529
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:20,530
I wake up feelin' sorry I met you.

530
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:24,367
Hopin' soon that I'll forget you.

531
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:26,161
When I look in the mirror.

532
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:27,704
To comb my hair

533
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:31,875
I see your face just smilin' there, yeah.

534
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:35,712
Nowhere to run to, baby.

535
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:38,757
Nowhere to hide.

536
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:43,428
Got nowhere to run to, baby.

537
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:46,097
Nowhere to hide.

538
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:50,060
I know you're no good for me.

539
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:52,229
But you've become a part of me.

540
00:33:52,354 --> 00:33:55,607
- What? When can I stop?
- When your hand falls off.

541
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,734
How can I fight a love.

542
00:33:58,026 --> 00:34:00,070
That shouldn't be?

543
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:02,322
And it's... so deep.

544
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,075
So dee-eep.

545
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:07,452
Deep inside of me.

546
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:09,621
My love's reachin' so high.

547
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,957
- How's it goin', Cave?
- Howyeh, Jimmy.

548
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,917
- Long time no see.
- Long time no hear.

549
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:16,086
I can't get around it, no.

550
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:18,213
Nowhere to run.

551
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:20,048
Nowhere to hide.

552
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,217
From you, baby.

553
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:26,179
Just can't get away from you, baby.

554
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:31,935
- Jesus, it's brilliant!
- Just leave it in the state you found it.

555
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,063
- How long's your boss away for?
- Only two months.

556
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:37,899
Unless he gets time off
for good behaviour.

557
00:34:37,983 --> 00:34:41,069
Nowhere to run to, baby.

558
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,905
Nowhere to hide.

559
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:48,034
Got nowhere to run to, baby.

560
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:51,746
Nowhere to hide.

561
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:58,378
- Look at this place!
- The ceiling's beautiful!

562
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,338
Jaysis!

563
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:03,884
- Pigeons and everything! Great(!)
- Lovely spot!

564
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,511
I haven't got any bleedin' cigarettes!

565
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,184
- Where'd you get this piano?
- It's me granny's.

566
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,477
- That was nice of her.
- She doesn't know I took it.

567
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:17,564
But she doesn't use
the front room very often.

568
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:19,107
Ow!

569
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,193
Up! Up!

570
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:23,445
Lift it!

571
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:27,824
Two. Two.

572
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:29,284
Two! Two!

573
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:37,876
Two! Two! Two! Two!

574
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,836
Two!

575
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:42,923
- Where'd yeh get the gear?
- Don't ask.

576
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:45,133
Fuckin' rapid!

577
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,843
- Are yeh ready, Steven?
- Yeah, ready.

578
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:49,012
Two, two! One, two!

579
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:50,514
That's enough!

580
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:54,100
OK, Joey, we can't put this thing off
for ever. Let's get busy.

581
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:58,730
Mustang Sally, brothers and sisters. And
remember: Rome wasn't built in a day.

582
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,899
- Dublin was.
- In an hour!

583
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:02,817
One, two, three, four!

584
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:03,902
One, two!

585
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:05,820
Mustang Sally.

586
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:13,745
Guess you better slow
that Mustang down.

587
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:22,587
Mustang Sally now, baby.

588
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:28,927
Guess you better slow
that Mustang down.

589
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:40,355
Oooooh... ooh!

590
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,110
Well, I guess you gotta put
your flat feet on the ground.

591
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:55,203
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

592
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,497
Ride, Sally, ri...

593
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:00,375
Hold it, hold it.

594
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:01,710
Hold it!

595
00:37:01,793 --> 00:37:05,463
Now, sisters, that's where you
all come in. Ride around, Sally.

596
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:07,507
Ride, Sally, ride.

597
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:08,925
- Sorry.
- I'm scarlet!

598
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:09,676
Again.

599
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,388
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

600
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:16,850
Ride, Sally, ride.

601
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:20,729
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

602
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:23,398
Roid, Sally, roid.

603
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:29,029
Look, don't use your own accents. It's
ride, Sally, ride. Not roid, Sally, roid.

604
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:31,489
Ride, Sally, ride.

605
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:32,449
From the top.

606
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:34,576
Mustang Sally.

607
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:41,917
Guess you better slow
that Mustang down.

608
00:37:47,923 --> 00:37:50,842
Mustang Sally now, baby.

609
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,261
- What were you playin'?
- C, F and G.

610
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,472
You weren't. It's not the chords, anyway.

611
00:37:55,597 --> 00:37:57,557
- What are they, then?
- C, F, C, C.

612
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:01,686
- You'd look better without your glasses.
- I'm blind without my glasses.

613
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,647
So was Ray Charles.

614
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,733
Your drumming's coming along, Billy.
Have yeh been practising?

615
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:08,610
Me da's dead and
me brothers are younger.

616
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:09,653
So?

617
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:12,531
So there's no one to tell me
to shut the fuck up.

618
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:14,157
Look at him!

619
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:16,785
- He eats like a pig.
- He's such a prick!

620
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,497
Hasn't got the voice of a prick, though.
Joey says it belongs to God.

621
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,457
God should ask for it back.

622
00:38:22,582 --> 00:38:26,503
- I suppose Jimmy'll groom him.
- Teach him to use a knife and fork.

623
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:30,090
- Are you all choir girls, then?
- What if we are?

624
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:33,969
Well, you've got fair voices, but you're
not putting much of that into it.

625
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,887
Good Jaysis!

626
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,139
All mouth and bollix!

627
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:41,810
- I bet he's never done the business.
- I bet he does it every night.

628
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,895
Get me share.

629
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:48,775
That's why you don't play guitar. You've
lost the muscles in your right hand!

630
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,382
Are yeh doin' what I told you? Are you
thinkin' of that reed as a woman's nipple?

631
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:15,677
- I am, yeah.
- Do you mind me askin' who she is?

632
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:21,558
She lives across the street from me. But I
feel embarrassed. She's still at school.

633
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:25,187
Maybe you should set
your sights a little higher.

634
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,690
My trumpet was always Gina Lollobrigida.

635
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:32,110
- I've never heard of her.
- A fine woman!

636
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:35,697
I could try, uh... Kim Basinger.

637
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,283
Is she...?

638
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:40,493
Ohh! Yeah!

639
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:42,204
Good.

640
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:44,831
Pick a nipple and try it again.

641
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:03,141
One of these early mornings.

642
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:07,979
Oh, I'm gonna be wipin'
your weepin' eyes.

643
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:09,731
Yeah.

644
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:18,365
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

645
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,576
Ride, Sally, ride.

646
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:26,248
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

647
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:29,042
Ride, Sally, ride.

648
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:33,713
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

649
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,633
Ride, Sally, ride.

650
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:41,429
One of these early mornings

651
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,309
I'm gonna be wipin' your weepin' eyes.

652
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:47,769
Yeah.

653
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:51,147
Yeah.

654
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:55,735
Oh, sweet ba-a-abe!

655
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:57,112
Yeah!

656
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:02,117
OK, everyone. We're gettin' there,
no question. Let's call it a night.

657
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:05,579
That was a load o' shite.

658
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:07,330
It was woeful,

659
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:09,583
but that boy can sing.

660
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:16,089
And it was a start. I believe in starts. Once
you have the start, the rest is inevitable.

661
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:20,552
All right, folks, we've done good work
tonight. Will you form a circle, please?

662
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,053
You too, Jimmy.

663
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:24,890
Come on, come on. Just form a circle.

664
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,606
Now, everybody turn right.

665
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:39,321
Now let's pat ourselves on
the back for a job well done!

666
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:58,340
Mr Rabbitte, you've been collecting
unemployment benefit for two years.

667
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:00,675
Are you telling me you can't get a job?

668
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,970
We're a Third World country.
What can yeh do?

669
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:13,480
- Jimmy! Howayeh?
- Dean! Didn't know you were on the dole.

670
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:17,400
- Three months now. How about yourself?
- Lost count. Yeh know how it is.

671
00:42:17,484 --> 00:42:20,487
- See you at Joey's. Tuesday, is it?
- Yeah, Tuesday.

672
00:42:20,695 --> 00:42:22,322
See yeh there.

673
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:25,909
Jimmy! It feels much better
bein' an unemployed musician

674
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:28,537
than an unemployed pipe fitter!

675
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:45,011
Check that horn.

676
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,721
You?

677
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,683
Joey The Lips.

678
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:58,400
This is an all-star album. Very rare.

679
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:01,444
I'll get a pen, and then
I can autograph it for yis.

680
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:05,073
He's full of it.

681
00:43:05,156 --> 00:43:08,159
Look, that's Joey there,
next to Otis Redding.

682
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:11,037
That could be anybody.
All yeh can see is the trumpet.

683
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,832
Look at this, then. "Trumpet, J Fagan."

684
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:17,169
- Ah, it's a very common name.
- Not in Detroit.

685
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:20,255
He's played with all the
greats, then? Your Joey?

686
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:24,176
Oh, yes, indeed.
He was in America for years!

687
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:29,389
But I'll tell you something that
nobody knows about my Joey.

688
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,687
Wherever he went, or wherever he played,

689
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,565
he always sent me a postcard.

690
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:45,030
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,909
They say it's a man's world.

692
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:52,078
Oh, but you can't prove that by me.

693
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,915
Excuse me. Is this Bluebell Way?

694
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:59,377
No, this is Marigold.
Bluebell's over there an' to the left.

695
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,173
Show some respect for me.

696
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:08,220
If you wanna do right...

697
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:16,895
Hey!

698
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,730
What?

699
00:44:19,147 --> 00:44:24,361
- You're not takin' that into the lift?
- I have to. The stairs would kill him.

700
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:33,870
- Hello, Mrs McGloughlin. Is Bernie in?
- She is. Come on in, will yeh?

701
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,997
Close that door.

702
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,417
- Howyeh, Bernie.
- Howayeh, Jimmy?

703
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:42,420
If Jimmy wants tea,
you've to make it yourself.

704
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:44,631
Oh, I'm not bothered, thanks.

705
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:47,926
Move that washing
if yeh want to sit down.

706
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,223
Bernie, you've been missin' rehearsals.

707
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:57,769
You can see why! Me ma can't work -
she's about to drop another one.

708
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:01,314
Me da's in the fuckin' hospital.
I'm the only one bringin' any money in.

709
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:03,900
- It's tough, I know, but...
- What?

710
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,945
It's hard when only two
backup singers show up.

711
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:09,698
You're not dumpin' me.
I brought in the other two.

712
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,825
Or is that why yeh fuckin' asked me?

713
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,661
You've got the best voice
o' the three of yis!

714
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:17,998
Bollix! You just wanted to get
your paws on lmelda Quirke.

715
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:22,335
Watch the fuckin'...! Yeh fuckin' bollix,
yeh! Go and fuckin' play!

716
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,297
Look at the bloody mess yeh made!

717
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,177
Look, Jimmy, I'll catch up.
I need this band more than any of us.

718
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:33,555
I need somethin' to look forward to.

719
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:46,985
A lot o' work.

720
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,281
If you didn't do it for God,
who would you do it for?

721
00:46:03,168 --> 00:46:06,338
- Steven!
- Jimmy. Father Molloy will be here soon.

722
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:07,881
- Great sound, wha'?
- Yeah.

723
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:11,885
I wish my granny had
one of these we could borrow.

724
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:16,014
- Great intro, uh?
- They nicked it from Marvin Gaye.

725
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:18,141
He nicked it from Bach!

726
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:20,602
Ah, it's beautiful.

727
00:46:21,937 --> 00:46:25,106
We skipped the light fantastic.

728
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:28,568
Skipped the light fandango!

729
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:32,155
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor.

730
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:38,912
I was feeling kinda seasick.

731
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:46,211
But the crowd called out for more.

732
00:46:46,878 --> 00:46:48,922
Poxiest bleedin' lyrics ever written.

733
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:53,343
One of sixteen vestal virgins leaving
for the coast. What's that mean?

734
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,763
I never understood that, either.

735
00:46:57,722 --> 00:46:59,516
It's a very peculiar lyric.

736
00:47:00,183 --> 00:47:02,727
Howayeh, Father?
Did you talk to the committee?

737
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,397
I have, and they've agreed in principle.

738
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,942
It would have to be the 28th
because Danny, our bingo caller,

739
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:11,862
is going into hospital to have
a tap put in his kidneys.

740
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:13,405
28th. No problem.

741
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:16,116
I'm sure you'll blow their minds, Jimmy!

742
00:47:21,246 --> 00:47:26,209
Look here, girls. Take this advice.
And remember always in life:

743
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,213
Into each heart.

744
00:47:30,672 --> 00:47:32,716
Some tears must fall.

745
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:36,219
Though you love and lose.

746
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,138
You must stand tall.

747
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,016
Cos... we've all got to cry sometimes.

748
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,976
Yeah, yeah, yeah

749
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,687
- I said sigh sometimes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,731
- Pull yourself together.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:49,774
No use crying for ever.

752
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:50,692
Because there's.

753
00:47:50,817 --> 00:47:52,694
Too many fish in the sea.

754
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,905
Too many fish in the sea

755
00:47:54,988 --> 00:47:57,032
I said there's short ones.

756
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:58,825
Tall ones.

757
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,160
Too many fish in the sea.

758
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:02,412
You're supposed to come in.

759
00:48:02,495 --> 00:48:05,665
All right, we'll take a break.
You're gettin' there, girls.

760
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,919
It's not just how you sing, it's how
you move. You're sex machines.

761
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:11,880
My ma would crease me
if she thought I was a sex machine!

762
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:15,133
- Greg wouldn't complain, would he!
- Piss off, you!

763
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:19,971
- Whose turn is it to get the hamburgers?
- Sweet child, it'll be my pleasure.

764
00:48:20,055 --> 00:48:22,516
I'll come with yeh, Joey.

765
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:26,603
- If they're singin', what am I to do?
- Play with yourself!

766
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:29,272
Sing along.
You've bigger tits than all o' them.

767
00:48:29,397 --> 00:48:31,024
Fuck you!

768
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:57,801
Oh, Jaysis!

769
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:02,514
- Here.
- What are you starin' at?

770
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,683
Nothin', Joey.

771
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:09,187
You fairly ruffled my savoir-faire
there, Dean, my man.

772
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:12,941
- I thought you were goin' for the burgers.
- I am gone, Dean.

773
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,826
You're gonna want my love someday.

774
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,578
Well-a bye, bye, baby.

775
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,204
- You've organised a gig?
- Yeah.

776
00:49:26,288 --> 00:49:28,248
- Where?
- Community centre.

777
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:33,461
That's a desperate place! Full of old-age
pensioners learnin' ballroom dancin'!

778
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:35,881
- It's a room with a stage.
- How much will it cost?

779
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,092
Nothin'. We told Father Molloy
it's part of his anti-heroin campaign.

780
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:41,178
I can get my little brother to do a poster.

781
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:42,846
The 28th is no time away.

782
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:45,223
We've two songs.
All we need is another ten.

783
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:46,057
Ten?!

784
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:51,062
You'll never believe what I just seen! Joey
and Natalie gettin' it off on the stairs!

785
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:54,649
- I'm tellin' the truth!
- Knob off! What if she was?

786
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:57,152
- It's Natalie's business!
- Tongues, was it?

787
00:49:57,235 --> 00:49:58,945
- Yeah!
- He's got terrible breath!

788
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,948
- Lads, it's a free country.
- But he's old and he's ugly.

789
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,491
You're young and you're uglier.

790
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:06,369
You'd get off with Joan Collins
quick enough, and she's 50!

791
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:10,665
And you'd do it with Tina Turner,
and she's a granny!

792
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:13,835
Joey's not married, so fair fucks to him.

793
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:17,756
Yous are all so fuckin' stupid!
Natalie got off with him!

794
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,884
- Then she's a slut.
- Fuck you, yeh fat fucker!

795
00:50:22,928 --> 00:50:25,722
Me knee! Ohh, Jaysis!

796
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,937
OK. Let's have a look at it.

797
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:42,656
Hey, that's really good!
But there's only one E in heroin.

798
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,283
- Wha'?
- There's no E at the end of heroin.

799
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:48,161
You little bollix!
There's only one E in heroin!

800
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,955
- No, there isn't.
- Yes, there is!

801
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,667
- The syringe is good, though.
- No one round here can spell.

802
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,294
Today, St Bridget's Community Centre.

803
00:50:56,461 --> 00:50:58,588
Tomorrow... oblivion.

804
00:50:58,672 --> 00:50:59,923
Where's Oblivion?

805
00:51:00,048 --> 00:51:05,178
Jimmy! Jimmy! Mickah Wallace
wants to see yeh. He's in the pub.

806
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,974
- Mickah Wallace?!
- I hired him to do the door. Security.

807
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:13,436
- You're mad, Jimmy! He's a savage!
- I know he is. But he's our savage.

808
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:16,273
- He'll fuck off with the money!
- Shh! Dean!

809
00:51:16,356 --> 00:51:18,066
Sorry, Father.

810
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:20,026
One! Two!

811
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:22,612
One! Two! Testin'!

812
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:25,240
One! Two! Testin'!

813
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:27,993
One! Two! Testin'!

814
00:51:28,076 --> 00:51:30,370
One! Two! Testin'!

815
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:34,583
That's a good strong mike, that.
Quality's very rare these days.

816
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,628
Are yeh sure now? Two pounds to
come in. Half-price to the unwaged.

817
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:40,130
Got it.

818
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:45,010
Ben Nevis on the stand side! Come on,
Ben Nevis! Lester's out the saddle!

819
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:48,763
Shit! He's just fallen and croaked.
And now I want to sing for yis.

820
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:51,308
Tell me why I don't like Mondays!

821
00:51:51,558 --> 00:51:54,227
Tell me why I don't like Mondays!

822
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:05,030
- I've a bugle here you can blow on.
- I've an arse here you can kiss!

823
00:52:06,781 --> 00:52:10,619
Where's me knob? I know I tucked it
into me sock before I came out!

824
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:16,291
- I can't get this hair to stay down.
- These suits are a waste o' money.

825
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:20,921
- He's upset cos it hides his tattoos.
- All Motown brothers wore suits.

826
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,631
Neat. Dignified.

827
00:52:22,714 --> 00:52:25,008
You'll play better in your suit.

828
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:29,137
- But I can't lift me sax in this jacket.
- Swap it with Outspan, then.

829
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:30,764
- D'yeh mind?
- No.

830
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:34,476
Fuckin' monkey suit.
I haven't worn one since that weddin'.

831
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,896
- I puked on mine. Remember?
- Remember? Some of it got on me.

832
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,981
Are yeh decent? We're comin' out!

833
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,655
I didn't recognise meself!

834
00:52:46,738 --> 00:52:50,659
I hope I don't need a piss in this dress.
I'd never get it back on again!

835
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:53,495
There'd be plenty of volunteers to help!

836
00:52:53,578 --> 00:52:56,414
Will they be eatin' chips
out of our knickers?

837
00:52:56,498 --> 00:52:58,291
I wouldn't say no!

838
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,460
It's £2.

839
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:05,757
Howyeh doin', Mrs Foster?
Outspan's up on the stage.

840
00:53:13,765 --> 00:53:15,642
Any messin' and I'll kill yeh, right?

841
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:24,067
- What's wrong?
- He's bein' sick!

842
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:28,196
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.
Come on. It'll be all right.

843
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:31,449
Sweet Jaysis!
She promised me she wouldn't come!

844
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,451
- Who?
- Me ma!

845
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,830
- I'm not goin' on.
- Go and find Mickah. He'll get him on.

846
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:40,500
My ma would beat the shite
out o' Mickah Wallace any day!

847
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,627
Shh! Shut the fuck up!

848
00:53:44,796 --> 00:53:47,090
Ladies and gentlemen...

849
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:53,180
Put your working-class hands together
for the saviours of soul,

850
00:53:53,305 --> 00:53:56,892
the hardest-working band
in the world! Yes! Yes, yes!

851
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:58,977
The Commitments!

852
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:01,021
Wrong rope, Brother Rabbitte.

853
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:04,065
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Commitments!

854
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,993
Get the fuck off!

855
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,794
- Hurry up!

856
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:27,297
Brother Billy.

857
00:54:27,422 --> 00:54:29,049

858
00:54:29,174 --> 00:54:30,509
Oh, shit! Yeah.

859
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:32,886
If I catch you messin', you're out!

860
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,435
They call me Mr Pitiful.

861
00:54:41,436 --> 00:54:43,313
Baby, that's my name.

862
00:54:44,606 --> 00:54:47,400
They call me Mr Pitiful.

863
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,694
That's how I got my fame.

864
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:53,406
But nobody seems to understand now.

865
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,159
What makes a man feel so blue.

866
00:54:56,618 --> 00:54:59,538
Ohh, they call me Mr Pitiful.

867
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:01,998
Cos I lost someone just like you.

868
00:55:02,874 --> 00:55:04,918
They call me Mr Pitiful.

869
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,796
Most everybody knows now.

870
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,341
They call me Mr Pitiful.

871
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,802
Most every place I go now.

872
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,181
But nobody seems to understand now.

873
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:20,559
What makes a man
sing such a sad song.

874
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:24,104
Ohh, when he lost everything.

875
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,314
When he lost everything.

876
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:28,817
Hello, Dublin!

879
00:55:35,574 --> 00:55:37,200
How can I explain to you.

880
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,579
Somebody actin' so very blue?

881
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,124
How can I tell you about my thing?

882
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,917
Oh, nothin' to do.

883
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:48,253
Mr Pitiful!

884
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:55,218
- You'll apologise to the girls!

885
00:55:55,302 --> 00:55:57,596

00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,308
Fuckin' bastard!

887
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:03,643
Cos nobody seems to understand now.

888
00:56:04,102 --> 00:56:07,355
What makes a man
sing such a sad song.

889
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,941
Oh, when he lost everythin'

890
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:12,402
When he lost everythin'

891
00:56:15,113 --> 00:56:16,656
We-ell.

892
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,200
Your love was.

893
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:20,327
Sweeter than.

894
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,120
Any I know.

895
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:23,872
So-oh-oh.

896
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,624
Don't come back.

897
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,917
Runnin' or.

898
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,544
Knockin' on my front door.

899
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:31,296
Well, you said that I.

900
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,051
Was your only girl.

901
00:56:36,134 --> 00:56:37,761
Do-do.

902
00:56:37,886 --> 00:56:38,970
There ain't no other.

903
00:56:39,054 --> 00:56:40,597
Do-do, do-do.

904
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,724
In the whole wide world.

905
00:56:42,891 --> 00:56:44,351
Do-do, do-do.

906
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,478
You know you took my love.

907
00:56:46,728 --> 00:56:49,105
Threw it away.

908
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:51,900
You're gonna want my love someday.

Bye bye bye, baby.

00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:06,831
Bye bye, baby.

915
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:08,834
Goodbye, goodbye.

916
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,544
Bye bye, baby.

917
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,420
Bye bye, bye bye.

Well, goo-ood-bye now.

00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,463
For crisps and Coke?

929
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,716
Go on.

930
00:57:58,258 --> 00:58:02,554
Aaahh, show me a man

00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:26,328
Show me a man that's

938
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:31,374
Show me a man that's

939
00:58:31,499 --> 00:58:34,586
I'll show you a man that
goes to work hummin'

940
00:58:34,669 --> 00:58:37,672
You know he's got
some sweet lovin' comin'

941
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:41,051
At the end of his workin' day.

942
00:58:41,176 --> 00:58:43,720
Yeah.

943
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:56,733
Show me a woman

944
00:58:56,816 --> 00:58:57,816
Show me.

945
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,198
I wanna see a woman out there
claims she's got a good man.

00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:04,448

951
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:27,305
Don't touch him!

952
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,312
Get an ambulance, quick!

953
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:37,107
- Fuckin' eejit!
- We want more! We want more!

954
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:53,039
- If Derek dies, we'll be famous.
- What are you on about?

955
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:57,335
It's a sure way to get famous.
Die on a stage... Get shot in a motel...

956
00:59:57,419 --> 01:00:00,839
- We'd sell millions of records.
- I don't understand what happened.

957
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,758
You have to keep the juice from
the amps and the mikes separate.

958
01:00:03,842 --> 01:00:05,719
Derek was the earth there for a minute.

959
01:00:05,844 --> 01:00:09,764
- Isn't that how the guy from AC/DC died?
- No. He choked on his own vomit.

960
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:13,643
- So did your man from Free, didn't he?
- Yeah. Lots o' them.

961
01:00:13,727 --> 01:00:15,937
- Keith Moon.
- Jimi Hendrix.

962
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:18,440
- Brian Jones.
- No, he drowned.

963
01:00:18,565 --> 01:00:20,609
- Did he?
- Yeah.

964
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:22,485
- Mama Cass?
- That was vomit.

965
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:23,486
Vomit.

966
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,363
- Not a heart attack?
- No.

967
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:27,991
Maybe we could get Deco
to choke on his own vomit!

968
01:00:28,116 --> 01:00:30,076
Lads, it's alive!

969
01:00:30,202 --> 01:00:32,746
Derek! Howayeh doin'!

970
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:36,541
They don't get many electrocutions
on Saturday night.

971
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,461
It's mostly bottles in the face
and bruised balls.

972
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:42,380
They said it was a mild shock.
Didn't feel mild to me.

973
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:45,800
- Made me hair stand on end.
- Your hair always stands on end.

974
01:00:45,926 --> 01:00:48,220
Not fuckin' all of it!

975
01:01:02,234 --> 01:01:05,111
- See yeh, Derek.
- See yeh.

976
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,239
Bye now.

977
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:12,994
- Rehearsal's tomorrow night, all right?
- OK!

978
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,540
We need a year's rehearsal.
We're all over the place.

979
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:20,418
It was raw, sure. But there was
moments where you were cookin'.

980
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:22,462
It was only kids and relatives.

981
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:25,924
What are yeh sayin'?
One gig and we pack it in?

982
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,718
Why d'yis want to be in a band?
Is it the money?

983
01:01:28,802 --> 01:01:30,512
- What money?
- So it's the chicks.

984
01:01:30,595 --> 01:01:32,806
- No.
- Why, then?

985
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,350
- It's hard to say.
- You want to be different.

986
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:39,104
You want to stand out from the rest o' the
tossers. You want to get up and shout:

987
01:01:39,187 --> 01:01:44,067
"I'm Derek fuckin' Scully
and I'm not a tosser!" Isn't that it?

988
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,361
- That's it, Jimmy.
- Well, don't forget it!

989
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:51,449
Unless you want to spend the rest o' your
life wrappin' frozen fuckin' chickens!

990
01:01:57,497 --> 01:02:02,627
Jimmy, did yeh ever have any doubts that
things wouldn't turn out as you planned?

991
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:05,505
Well, I'd be tellin'
fibs if I didn't, Terry.

992
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:09,342
And there was that oul'
rock'n'roll demon, S-E-X.

993
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,136
Sex, Jimmy?

994
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:12,929
Sex, Terry.

995
01:02:13,054 --> 01:02:16,558
- Sex?
- Fuck off! I'm being interviewed!

996
01:02:25,817 --> 01:02:33,817

Don't get hung up on anythang.

Our signs have brought us

Will yeh stop talkin' shite, Joey?

1007
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,135
Who's the black private dick
that's a sex machine to all the chicks?

1008
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:35,512
Shaft!

1009
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:36,972
Damn right.

1010
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:42,561
- Can I have your autographs?
- Get lost, Tommy Boyle!

1011
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:45,814
- I liked the light show at the end.
- Shag off!

1012
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:50,318
The kids around here will be thinkin' of us
when they play with their willies!

1013
01:03:50,402 --> 01:03:52,779
Your Greg wasn't too happy.

1014
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:55,532
I'd tell him to fuck off,
only me ma'd crease me.

1015
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:57,659
- Dean's nice, wha'?
- I suppose so.

1016
01:03:57,742 --> 01:04:01,663
- He's serious. I like that.
- Got a nice little arse on him!

1017
01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:03,373
- Jimmy's nice.
- He's great.

1018
01:04:03,498 --> 01:04:07,419
- Always got a nice smell on him.
- D'yeh think he's a bit...

1019
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:10,338
- Jaysis, no!
- He never seems to fancy any of us.

1020
01:04:10,422 --> 01:04:12,799
I'd have thought you'd find that a relief.

1021
01:04:12,924 --> 01:04:16,595
- When are yis playing next?
- That's up to our manager.

1022
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:18,722
I feel like Madonna!

1023
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:58,637
Ah, Jaysis!
Get him off the fuckin' drums!

1024
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,514
Shut up, Deco!

1025
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:05,435
Get the fuckin' hell out!

1026
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:08,605
Doesn't take long to get
the hang of it, does it?

1027
01:05:08,688 --> 01:05:10,982
It takes control and skill,

1028
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,485
so you're fucked for starters.

1029
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:16,863
Fuckin' pig!

1030
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:18,823
D'yeh know Wilson Pickett, Joey?

1031
01:05:18,907 --> 01:05:21,034
I jammed with the man. Many moons ago.

1032
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:24,621
We'll be all right for
backstage passes, then. Look.

1033
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:28,500
- "Pickett adds Ireland to European slate."
- Who's Wilson Pickett?

1034
01:05:28,583 --> 01:05:31,586
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour!

1035
01:05:31,711 --> 01:05:35,632
You'll wait longer than that
to get near me, yeh fuckin' gobshite!

1036
01:05:37,217 --> 01:05:40,178
- Can I have a word, Jimmy?
- Sure. What is it?

1037
01:05:40,262 --> 01:05:43,348
- This gig on the 15th. I won't be here.
- What?!

1038
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,893
I'll be on me holidays with Greg and
the family. We've got a caravan...

1039
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:50,355
- A caravan?!
- I know. It's not very soul, is it?

1040
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:51,439
It bleedin' isn't!

1041
01:05:51,565 --> 01:05:54,442
- It was arranged months ago.
- Months ago we didn't have this band!

1042
01:05:54,526 --> 01:05:58,029
Just gettin' goin' and you're pissin' off
to some tossin' campin' site!

1043
01:05:58,113 --> 01:06:02,576
- You're makin' me feel worse...
- I can't believe you, lmelda!

1044
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:05,537
Ah, for Jaysis' sake, Jimmy!
What can I do?

1045
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:09,040
Will yis all get on! It's not as if
yeh don't need the practice!

1046
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:19,092
Hey there, here I am

1047
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,219
I'm a man on the scene.

1048
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:24,181
I can give you what you want.

1049
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:26,057
But you got to come back with me.

1050
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,810
I forgot some good old lovin'

1051
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:31,188
I got some in store.

1052
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,650
At least the little bollix is in key.

1053
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:38,862
Boys were comin' down by the dozen.

1054
01:06:39,154 --> 01:06:42,657
Jaysis, that's amazing!
You were actually in Graceland.

1055
01:06:43,158 --> 01:06:46,995
So, anyway, there's the four o' yis
sittin' in the front room o' the mansion.

1056
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,540
Vernon wasn't drinkin' lemonade,
if yeh know what I'm sayin'.

1057
01:06:50,665 --> 01:06:54,336
- Who's Vernon?
- Elvis's da! Vernon Presley!

1058
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:56,505
Go on, Joey.

1059
01:06:56,588 --> 01:06:58,298
He picked up Gina.

1060
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,008
Gina's me trumpet.

1061
01:07:00,091 --> 01:07:02,636
- And he puked right into her.
- He didn't!

1062
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:04,846
- Right into her.
- Good Jaysis!

1063
01:07:04,971 --> 01:07:06,765
I went upstairs...

1064
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:11,728
I said "Yo! Elvis, me man. Look what
your daddy's after doin' to my trumpet."

1065
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:14,189
- "Who's goin' to get her cleaned?"
- Hang on.

1066
01:07:14,648 --> 01:07:15,899
Get out!

1067
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:17,943
I said get out!

1068
01:07:19,945 --> 01:07:24,241
- What did Elvis say, Joey?
- Listen to this. This bit's brilliant.

1069
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:26,493
The man said nothin', at first.

1070
01:07:27,118 --> 01:07:30,205
He took Gina, very gently,

1071
01:07:30,288 --> 01:07:34,751
and he brought her into the bathroom
and he run her under the tap.

1072
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:38,797
Then he took out his handkerchief
and he gave her a good wipe.

1073
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,260
And he handed her back to me
and he said... he said...

1074
01:07:43,343 --> 01:07:45,470
"Joey The Lips,

1075
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:48,056
please forgive my daddy."

1076
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,274
Jaysis!

1077
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:03,864
Tell me something, Joey. In all the time
that you were in Graceland,

1078
01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:06,116
did you ever...

1079
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:10,328
did yeh ever see Elvis
messin' around with drugs?

1080
01:08:11,204 --> 01:08:12,664
No, brother.

1081
01:08:12,747 --> 01:08:18,837
I knew it! I always said...! And you,
yeh malignant little bastard! I knew it!

1082
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,964
My God Almighty!

1083
01:08:21,089 --> 01:08:23,925
Only the lonely.

1084
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:29,806
Know the way I feel tonight

1085
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:35,020
Lorraine, I can't get your head in.
Everybody bunch up.

1086
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:38,106
Come on, lmelda,
give us a smile! Cheese!

1087
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,024
Cheese!

1088
01:08:39,107 --> 01:08:40,734
Get on with the photograph!

1089
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:43,153
What are yeh takin' pictures for?
We're still in Dublin!

1090
01:08:43,278 --> 01:08:44,738
Cheese, everybody!

1091
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,072
Cheese!

1092
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:49,284
Here, let's get in out o' the cold.

1093
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:52,495
- I'm not goin'.
- Wha'?

1094
01:08:52,579 --> 01:08:54,956
- I can't!
- What are yeh talkin' about?

1095
01:08:55,081 --> 01:08:58,335
It's that bloody group.
You're goin' with them, aren't yeh?

1096
01:08:58,418 --> 01:08:59,669
I have to!

1097
01:08:59,753 --> 01:09:03,089
What you have to do is go on holiday
with your folks and me.

1098
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,926
- I'll follow yis tomorrow.
- You'll never find us!

1099
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:09,179
Ah, Ma, you'll be in
the same field as last year!

1100
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:18,688
- This stuff's so heavy!
- Would yeh give me a hand, Outspan?

1101
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:22,484
Mickah! Would you get your man
off the piano here?

1102
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:24,736
Would yeh get out o' the way there?

1103
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:29,199
Hey! Yeh never told me it was the whole
bleedin' Philharmonic we were bookin'.

1104
01:09:29,324 --> 01:09:33,787
They're takin' up half the shaggin' pub!
I normally put 20 people in that corner.

1105
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:35,872
20 leprechauns, maybe.

1106
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,544
Imelda!

1107
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:45,632
What happened to your holiday?

1108
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,509
Imelda!

1109
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:50,178
- What happened?
- I couldn't go.

1110
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:52,639
- Jaysis, me hair's a state!
- Yeh look great!

1111
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,307
There's no time to get me dress.

1112
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:56,852
- I'll buy you a bloody dress!
- Oh, will yeh?

1113
01:09:56,935 --> 01:09:59,145
She can pay me later!

1114
01:10:04,442 --> 01:10:07,946
- Is he porkin' her now?
- He must be dippin' his dick in steroids!

1115
01:10:09,447 --> 01:10:12,450
I don't know why I love you like I do.

1116
01:10:13,034 --> 01:10:15,829
After all these changes
that you put me through.

1117
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:16,913
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah.

1118
01:10:16,997 --> 01:10:19,624
Used all my money and my cigarettes.

1119
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:20,458
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah.

1120
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:23,461
And I haven't seen hide
nor hair of you yet

1121
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:26,464
I wanna know. Won't you tell me?

1122
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:27,716
Won't you tell me?

1123
01:10:27,799 --> 01:10:31,386
I'd love to stay.

1124
01:10:31,678 --> 01:10:32,345
Take me.

1125
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:33,013
Take me.

1126
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,307
Take me to the river.

1127
01:10:35,515 --> 01:10:37,100
Take me to the river.

1128
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:38,977
And wash me down.

1129
01:10:39,352 --> 01:10:40,520
Wash me down.

1130
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:42,439
Won't you cleanse my soul?

1131
01:10:42,564 --> 01:10:44,274
Oo-oo-ooh, my sou-ou-oul.

1132
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:46,276
Get my feet on the ground.

1133
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:48,111
On the ground, yeah.

1134
01:10:48,695 --> 01:10:50,405
Hey, yeah.

1135
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,407
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1136
01:10:52,532 --> 01:10:54,075
Hey, yeah, yeah.

1137
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:57,996
- Dip me in the water - Dip me.

1138
01:10:58,371 --> 01:10:59,706
Take me, take me to the river.

1139
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:02,000
- Dip me in the water, baby.
- Dip me.

1140
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,376
Take me, take me to the river.

1141
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,504
- Dip me in the water - Dip me.

1142
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:07,172
Take me, take me to the river.

1143
01:11:07,255 --> 01:11:09,299
- Dip me in the water - Dip me.

1144
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:11,676
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1145
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
Dip me.

1146
01:11:12,844 --> 01:11:13,678
Dip me.

1147
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:16,723
- Take me, take me to the river.
- I said dip me one more time, baby.

1148
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,493
- You gotta dip me.
- Take me, take me to the river, yeah.

1149
01:11:18,517 --> 01:11:23,647
Dip me in the water, yeah...

1150
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,774
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
01:11:28,276 --> 01:11:31,363
- Fuckin' eejit!
- Sorry, Joey. I got a bit carried away.

1152
01:11:31,446 --> 01:11:34,616
And you, George Michael!
Call me a fuckin' eejit again

1153
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:38,078
and you'll get a drumstick up your hole!
The one you don't sing out of!

1154
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:39,329
That'll be the day!

1155
01:11:39,412 --> 01:11:42,499
It's comin', so keep your Vaseline handy.

1156
01:11:42,624 --> 01:11:46,795
Keep cool, brothers.
We are the saviours of soul, remember?

1157
01:11:46,878 --> 01:11:48,463
Come on, let's go!

1158
01:11:49,714 --> 01:11:52,592
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1159
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:55,637
What I'd like to do for my fans now
is a nice slow song.

1160
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:57,013
Fans?

1161
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,015
It goes a little bit like this.

1162
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,726
Fucker.

1163
01:12:02,769 --> 01:12:08,692
At the dark end of the street.

1164
01:12:09,776 --> 01:12:14,656
That is where we always meet.

1165
01:12:15,282 --> 01:12:20,954
Hidin' in shadows
where we don't belong.

1166
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:26,918
Livin' in darkness to hide our wrong.

1167
01:12:28,003 --> 01:12:30,046
You and me.

1168
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:36,887
At the dark end of the street.

1169
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:40,098
You and me.

1170
01:12:41,683 --> 01:12:45,979
I know time is gonna take its toll.

1171
01:12:48,023 --> 01:12:52,569
We have to pay for the love we stole.

1172
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:58,825
It's a sin and we know it's wrong.

1173
01:13:00,202 --> 01:13:05,248
Ohh, but our love
keeps comin' on strong.

1174
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,667
Steal away.

1175
01:13:10,212 --> 01:13:14,508
To the dark end of the street.

1176
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:18,512
You and me.

1177
01:13:19,554 --> 01:13:21,598
They're gonna find us.

1178
01:13:22,599 --> 01:13:24,476
They're gonna find us.

1179
01:13:25,936 --> 01:13:30,899
They're gonna find us, love, someday.

1180
01:13:31,149 --> 01:13:34,069
You and me.

1181
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:39,908
At the dark end of the street.

1182
01:13:40,575 --> 01:13:43,495
You and me.

1183
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:50,377
And when the daylight hour rolls around.

1184
01:13:51,545 --> 01:13:56,424
And by chance we'll both go downtown.

1185
01:13:57,133 --> 01:14:02,889
If we should meet,
just walk, walk on by, yeah!

1186
01:14:02,973 --> 01:14:08,436
Ohh, darlin', please don't you cry.

1187
01:14:09,604 --> 01:14:11,815
Tonight we'll meet.

1188
01:14:11,898 --> 01:14:13,358
Oh.

1189
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:15,735
At the dark end.

1190
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:18,029
Of the street.

1191
01:14:36,631 --> 01:14:39,885
It sounds good now. Good brass section.

1192
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:45,891
I can give you what you want
but you gotta come back for more!

1193
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:47,058
Fuck off, piss brain!

1194
01:14:47,184 --> 01:14:49,561
Are we in with a chance
now you're single, lmelda?

1195
01:14:49,644 --> 01:14:53,231
- Derek's pantin' to make his move!
- Shut up, yeh gobshite!

1196
01:14:53,315 --> 01:14:55,192
Derek, I thought it was me yeh fancied.

1197
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:59,905
- You were havin' it off with Dean!
- Must've been when I wasn't lookin'!

1198
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:03,742
- We're all bustin' to ride 'Melda.
- I've no designs on lmelda.

1199
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:08,663
No, cos you're skewerin' Bernie,
and she's only half your age.

1200
01:15:08,747 --> 01:15:11,917
- Is he doin' it to Bernie?
- Sex, sex, sex! It fucks up everythin'!

1201
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:14,169
You told us soul was sex.

1202
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:17,589
Look, let's keep relations
on a professional basis.

1203
01:15:17,672 --> 01:15:19,799
Professional?! We've never been paid!

1204
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:22,802
I'm workin' on it! I'm
fuckin' workin' on it!

1205
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:28,767
Why don't you learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

1206
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,810
No fuckin' pay! Fuckin' crazy!

1207
01:15:30,936 --> 01:15:34,439
At the dark end of the street.

1208
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:38,151
You and me.

1209
01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:42,072
- Are you all right?
- Sure. They just get up me arse at times.

1210
01:15:42,155 --> 01:15:43,615
Want to share a taxi home?

1211
01:15:43,698 --> 01:15:48,495
- For fuck sake! How can yeh ask me that!
- If yeh weren't the manager, would yeh?

1212
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,288
- Would I what?
- Take me home.

1213
01:15:50,413 --> 01:15:52,207
But I am the manager.

1214
01:15:52,332 --> 01:15:54,626
You and me.

1215
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:59,923
At the dark end of the street.

1216
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:03,635
You and me.

1217
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:13,436
D'yeh not think it better to have
the Customs House in the background?

1218
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,899
I'm not after a bleedin' postcard!
I'm after urban decay.

1219
01:16:18,024 --> 01:16:20,777
Where's Billy?
We're freezin' our tits off here.

1220
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:23,864
- Are your nipples all hard?
- You make me want to vomit!

1221
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,907
- Will this be in the papers?
- Could be.

1222
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:28,285
Fame! I wanna live till Tuesday!

1223
01:16:28,368 --> 01:16:32,747
- What's this? Bingo callers' convention?
- Get him, Mickah!

1224
01:16:43,008 --> 01:16:47,554
- You're not even changed, Billy.
- There's no point. I'm leavin' the band.

1225
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:48,805
It's Deco. I hate him!

1226
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:52,601
He's not worth hatin'. He's just
a big fat boy with bollix for brains.

1227
01:16:52,726 --> 01:16:58,023
It's no use, Jimmy. I'm goin' to have to
hit him. And I'm on probation!

1228
01:16:58,106 --> 01:17:01,693
- Probation? What for?
- For hittin' a prick just like him.

1229
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,862
Where will I get a drummer
as good as you?

1230
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:05,739
Ah, you'll find someone.

1231
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:07,449
Ah, thanks a lot!

1232
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:10,410
You can have the loan of me kit
until you do.

1233
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:13,663
Anyone can play the drums, Billy.
So fuck off!

1234
01:17:13,788 --> 01:17:14,706
Ah, Jimmy...

1235
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:18,919
And we'll get our own tour bus with
"The Commitments" painted on the side.

1236
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:22,339
And "Billy Mooney's a Fuckin' Bollix"
on the back!

1237
01:17:22,422 --> 01:17:23,965
Mind me van, yeh fucker!

1238
01:17:24,049 --> 01:17:27,802
OK, everyone, a big serious face now.
That's it. Great. OK.

1239
01:17:27,928 --> 01:17:30,305
Big cheesy smile!
Everyone say "testicles".

1240
01:17:30,388 --> 01:17:32,432
Testicles!

1241
01:17:32,557 --> 01:17:34,851
Fair enough. Great stuff.

1242
01:18:00,919 --> 01:18:03,213
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1243
01:18:03,547 --> 01:18:06,341
It's been a month since
my last confession.

1244
01:18:06,466 --> 01:18:10,762
I've been with this band, and there's
been a lot of cursing and blasphemy.

1245
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:13,557
And I've been neglecting my exams.

1246
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,184
And there's these three girls
with the band.

1247
01:18:16,309 --> 01:18:18,103
I've had lustful thoughts.

1248
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:20,272
About all of them.

1249
01:18:20,438 --> 01:18:22,899
And when I studied I used to sing hymns.

1250
01:18:22,983 --> 01:18:27,112
Now I'm always humming "When a Man
Loves a Woman" by Marvin Gaye.

1251
01:18:27,195 --> 01:18:29,406
- Percy Sledge.
- Wha'?

1252
01:18:29,531 --> 01:18:33,034
It was Percy Sledge did that
particular song. I have the album.

1253
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:34,578
Oh.

1254
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:43,587
Saw the posters.
The band's playin' a few gigs?

1255
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,921
A few, yeah.

1256
01:18:45,046 --> 01:18:47,716
So why haven't I been paid?

1257
01:18:47,799 --> 01:18:49,843
That was the deal.

1258
01:18:49,968 --> 01:18:51,845
I get you gear,

1259
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:54,431
and you give me money.

1260
01:18:54,556 --> 01:18:58,143
I'll pay. It's just I've got
a few problems. Outgoings...

1261
01:18:58,268 --> 01:19:00,312
Yeah. Tell me about it.

1262
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:05,567
And I'm breakin' in a new drummer.

1263
01:19:11,698 --> 01:19:14,409
I think I'm gettin' the hang o' this!

1264
01:19:24,044 --> 01:19:25,044
Yes!

1265
01:19:28,465 --> 01:19:30,008
Here yeh are.

1266
01:19:30,091 --> 01:19:32,135
About bleedin' time!

1267
01:19:33,637 --> 01:19:35,597
Jimmy, do we have to do this?

1268
01:19:35,722 --> 01:19:38,892
- We've no choice, Bernie.
- What did yeh get a gig so far away for?

1269
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:43,188
- Cos they're payin' us money, that's why.
- But I could go to jail! Or lose me job!

1270
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:45,649
We are bringin' soul
to the people, my angel.

1271
01:19:45,732 --> 01:19:47,859
No jury in the land would convict us.

1272
01:19:47,943 --> 01:19:51,279
- Are we goin' in or wha'?
- If we're caught here, we're fucked.

1273
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:54,157
It's all right! Don't be worryin'.

1274
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,541
What's that? A Mister Chippy van?

1275
01:20:02,624 --> 01:20:06,378
- We can't travel in that shit heap.
- Buddy Holly's last words.

1276
01:20:06,503 --> 01:20:10,006
- "We can't travel in that shit heap."
- Did Buddy Holly say that?

1277
01:20:10,131 --> 01:20:13,885
Before he flew to meet his destiny
on that storm-tossed night.

1278
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,304
Will crashin' in a chipper van
make us famous?

1279
01:20:16,429 --> 01:20:19,683
Said to the man at the railroad station

1280
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:21,142
I want a ticket.

1281
01:20:21,268 --> 01:20:23,395
Just for one.

1282
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,606
He said: Well, if you insist.

1283
01:20:27,065 --> 01:20:29,860
Where you wanna go, miss?

1284
01:20:29,943 --> 01:20:31,319
Oh-oh.

1285
01:20:31,403 --> 01:20:34,906
Destination anywhere.

1286
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:38,785
East or west, I don't care.

1287
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,288
I have to fart.

1288
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:43,915
- What?
- I have to fart!

1289
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,421
Open a fuckin' window!

1290
01:20:57,762 --> 01:20:59,890
Would yeh have any
rock salmon, please?

1291
01:21:00,015 --> 01:21:02,726
Sorry, mister! We only have soul!

1292
01:21:06,313 --> 01:21:09,191
Said to the man at the railroad station

1293
01:21:09,482 --> 01:21:10,942
I want a ticket.

1294
01:21:11,026 --> 01:21:12,652
Just for one.

1295
01:21:20,744 --> 01:21:22,704
Baby, here I am

1296
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:25,040
I'm a man on the scene.

1297
01:21:25,582 --> 01:21:27,459
I can give you what you want.

1298
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:30,003
But you gotta come back with me

1299
01:21:30,337 --> 01:21:32,380
I forgot some good old lovin'

1300
01:21:32,506 --> 01:21:34,966
I got some in store.

1301
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,385
When it comes to takin' it all.

1302
01:21:37,469 --> 01:21:39,679
You gotta come back for more.

1303
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,140
Boys were comin' down by the dozen.

1304
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:44,643
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'

1305
01:21:44,768 --> 01:21:46,811
Pretty little thing,
let me light your candle.

1306
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,064
Cos, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now.

1307
01:21:49,147 --> 01:21:50,607
Yes, I am.

1308
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:56,404
Action speaks louder than words.

1309
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,114
And I'm a man with a great experience.

1310
01:21:58,198 --> 01:21:59,198
Oh, yeah?

1311
01:21:59,241 --> 01:22:01,201
I know you got you another man.

1312
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:02,911
But I can love you better than him.

1313
01:22:03,036 --> 01:22:03,787
Says who?

1314
01:22:03,995 --> 01:22:05,956
Take my hand, don't be afraid

1315
01:22:06,081 --> 01:22:07,791
I'm gonna prove every word I said.

1316
01:22:07,874 --> 01:22:08,875
No lie?

1317
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,877
I'm advertisin' love for free.

1318
01:22:11,002 --> 01:22:12,629
So won't you place your ad with me?

1319
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:13,547
Uh-uh.

1320
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,841
Boys were comin' down by the dozen.

1321
01:22:15,966 --> 01:22:18,260
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'

1322
01:22:18,385 --> 01:22:20,262
Pretty little thing,
let me light your candle.

1323
01:22:20,387 --> 01:22:22,430
Cos, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now.

1324
01:22:22,514 --> 01:22:24,140
Yes, I am.

1325
01:22:27,769 --> 01:22:32,899
I went through hell learnin' the sax. Now I
wanna get better. I wanna express meself.

1326
01:22:32,983 --> 01:22:36,903
That's commendable, Brother Dean.
But what you were playin' was not soul.

1327
01:22:36,987 --> 01:22:40,907
Soul solos are part of the song.
They have corners.

1328
01:22:41,032 --> 01:22:45,120
- You were spiralling. That's jazz.
- I'm just tryin' to stretch meself.

1329
01:22:45,203 --> 01:22:46,705
Jazz is musical wankin'.

1330
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:50,709
If you want a wank, use that
thing in your hand, not your sax!

1331
01:23:05,265 --> 01:23:07,475
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1332
01:23:07,934 --> 01:23:09,561
Over here!

1333
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:12,647
There's your money, son.
They're drinkin' like fishes.

1334
01:23:12,772 --> 01:23:14,983
- That's 200 quid.
- 200 quid?

1335
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:17,110
Big time, wha'? 200 quid!

1336
01:23:17,194 --> 01:23:20,113
Jimmy, this is Roddy Craig.
He's with The Herald.

1337
01:23:20,197 --> 01:23:22,324
- You got my message, then?
- Howayeh?

1338
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:25,368
- Glad you could make it.
- So how did this band come about?

1339
01:23:25,452 --> 01:23:28,330
- Jimmy put an ad...
- Destiny! We're a band with a mission.

1340
01:23:29,206 --> 01:23:30,373
What kind of mission?

1341
01:23:30,457 --> 01:23:33,877
Bringin' soul to Dublin.
Bringin' the music to the proletariat.

1342
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:38,715
We're against racial and sexual
discrimination, apartheid, and heroin.

1343
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,550
- When's your next gig?
- We haven't...

1344
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:43,178
We're the guerrillas of soul.
We don't announce gigs.

1345
01:23:43,303 --> 01:23:46,264
We hit, then we sink back
into the night.

1346
01:23:47,098 --> 01:23:49,643
That's guerrilla with a U, not an O.

1347
01:23:49,768 --> 01:23:51,394
Oh, yeah.

1348
01:23:52,062 --> 01:23:53,855
Chain, chain, chain.

1349
01:23:54,064 --> 01:23:55,774
Chain, chain, chain.

1350
01:23:56,066 --> 01:23:57,859
Chain, chain, chain.

1351
01:23:58,068 --> 01:23:59,861
Chain, chain, chain.

1352
01:24:00,111 --> 01:24:01,112
Chain, chain, chain.

1353
01:24:01,196 --> 01:24:04,157
Chain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1354
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:07,494
Chain of fools.

1355
01:24:08,245 --> 01:24:10,914
For five long years.

1356
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:15,001
I thought you were my man.

1357
01:24:16,545 --> 01:24:18,588
But I found out

1358
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:22,467
I'm just a link in your chain.

1359
01:24:24,761 --> 01:24:27,222
You got me where you want me.

1360
01:24:28,598 --> 01:24:31,142
I ain't nothin' but your fool.

1361
01:24:33,144 --> 01:24:35,856
You treated me mean.

1362
01:24:36,857 --> 01:24:39,609
You treated me cruel.

1363
01:24:41,486 --> 01:24:43,446
Chain, chain, chain.

1364
01:24:43,697 --> 01:24:45,490
Chain, chain, chain.

1365
01:24:45,574 --> 01:24:47,617
Chain of fools.

1366
01:24:49,786 --> 01:24:51,580
Every chain.

1367
01:24:53,957 --> 01:24:55,917
Has got a weak link.

1368
01:24:57,878 --> 01:25:00,797
I might be weak, child.

1369
01:25:01,548 --> 01:25:03,675
But I gave you strength.

1370
01:25:07,345 --> 01:25:08,513
Ooh! Ooh!

1371
01:25:08,638 --> 01:25:12,225
Now you tell me to leave you alone.

1372
01:25:13,018 --> 01:25:16,771
My papa says come on home.

1373
01:25:16,938 --> 01:25:21,067
My doctor says take it easy.

1374
01:25:21,151 --> 01:25:24,029
But your lovin' is much too strong

1375
01:25:24,321 --> 01:25:26,198
I'm wedded to your.

1376
01:25:26,364 --> 01:25:27,991
Chain, chain, chain.

1377
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:29,826
Chain, chain, chain.

1378
01:25:30,035 --> 01:25:31,912
Chain, chain, chain.

1379
01:25:32,162 --> 01:25:33,955
Chain, chain, chain.

1380
01:25:34,206 --> 01:25:36,249
Chain, chain, chain.

1381
01:25:43,298 --> 01:25:45,258
That's our money, pal!

1382
01:25:47,677 --> 01:25:49,721

01:26:01,775 --> 01:26:03,818
Chain...

1386
01:26:05,403 --> 01:26:07,447
Chain, chain.

1387
01:26:08,114 --> 01:26:10,242
Chain-ain-ain-ain-ain.

1388
01:26:10,367 --> 01:26:12,077
Are yeh OK?

1389
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,830
- You're fuckin' dead, Rabbitte!
- Still got the money, though.

1390
01:26:15,956 --> 01:26:19,793
I'll be fuckin' back for you an'

Ladies and gentlemen,

1403
01:27:05,422 --> 01:27:06,798
Chain, chain, chain.

1404
01:27:07,007 --> 01:27:09,301
Chain, chain, chain.

1405
01:27:09,509 --> 01:27:10,844
Chain, chain, chain.

1406
01:27:11,094 --> 01:27:12,971
Chain, chain, chain.

1407
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:17,100
Chain, chain, chain.

1408
01:27:24,107 --> 01:27:28,403
I got dreams, dreams.

1409
01:27:28,528 --> 01:27:31,364
To remember.

1410
01:27:31,531 --> 01:27:34,326
To remember

1411
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:43,418
I've been waitin' bleedin' ages!

1412
01:27:43,502 --> 01:27:48,131
- I don't suppose they'll let me park here.
- Fuck them. Listen to this.

1413
01:27:48,256 --> 01:27:50,967
"Following U2 and Sinéad O'Connor...

1414
01:27:51,051 --> 01:27:54,137
The Commitments could be the next
major act to come out of Dublin."

1415
01:27:54,221 --> 01:27:57,057
"The lead singer has a voice
Bob Geldof would starve for."

1416
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:00,644
U2, Sinéad, Geldof, and us
in one paragraph. Deadly, wha'?

1417
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:04,022
- We'll show this to me mammy.
- We'll show it to Wilson Pickett.

1418
01:28:04,147 --> 01:28:06,358
I'd better handle this thing alone.

1419
01:28:06,483 --> 01:28:09,027
- Why? I want to meet the man.
- It's personal.

1420
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:12,197
You told me him and you were friends
and he'd do us a favour.

1421
01:28:12,322 --> 01:28:16,243
I know, but the last time I met Wilson
things were a bit sticky.

1422
01:28:16,743 --> 01:28:18,286
It's personal.

1423
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:21,373
Hold on to that. Keep an eye on the bike.

1424
01:28:39,432 --> 01:28:41,142
Roddy!

1425
01:28:41,226 --> 01:28:43,770
Ah, howayeh, Jimmy?

1426
01:28:43,854 --> 01:28:46,690
Your office said you were here.
What happened?

1427
01:28:46,773 --> 01:28:49,734
Two eejits tried to hold up
the bank with pump guns.

1428
01:28:49,818 --> 01:28:51,528
What's this? The getaway cart?

1429
01:28:51,695 --> 01:28:54,072
No, the poor horse
caught it in the crossfire.

1430
01:28:54,197 --> 01:28:58,118
- I thought you only covered music.
- Music, crime, funerals...

1431
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:00,328
Are yeh goin' to the Wilson Pickett show?

1432
01:29:00,495 --> 01:29:01,580
Bleedin' right I am.

1433
01:29:01,663 --> 01:29:04,374
I owe you for the review. Fuckin' rapid!

1434
01:29:04,457 --> 01:29:07,169
Come to Gallagher's afterwards,
where we're playin'.

1435
01:29:07,252 --> 01:29:08,670
Oh, yeah. Right.

1436
01:29:09,296 --> 01:29:11,965
And Pickett's gonna jam with us!

1437
01:29:12,632 --> 01:29:16,303
- He is in his bollix!
- World exclusive, Roddy!

1438
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,472
He thinks he's Basil Brush.

1439
01:29:19,556 --> 01:29:22,475
- Just fuckin' relax, would yeh?
- Fuckin' idiot!

1440
01:29:22,559 --> 01:29:25,103
This place is infested with rats!

1441
01:29:29,357 --> 01:29:32,068
You do look like a rat! Ratso Foster!

1442
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:34,905
Oh, supercool!

1443
01:29:35,822 --> 01:29:37,782
- Where's your white walkin' stick?
- Fuck off!

1444
01:29:37,908 --> 01:29:40,911
Bring the guide dog, yeah? Lovely hair!

1445
01:29:41,036 --> 01:29:43,747
At least I have some fuckin' hair!

1446
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:46,499
- Steven?
- Yeah?

1447
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,710
- Could I talk to yeh?
- About what?

1448
01:29:48,793 --> 01:29:52,297
Well, you're educated, and...
I've had this offer, see?

1449
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:55,509
It's from another band.
We reckon it could be a good move.

1450
01:29:55,634 --> 01:29:58,386
- "We"? You have advisors, is it?
- Well, me ma, like.

1451
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:01,556
- What's this?
- Mr Cuffe has an offer he can't refuse.

1452
01:30:01,681 --> 01:30:03,225
Offer of wha'?

1453
01:30:03,308 --> 01:30:06,019
From another band with a record deal.

1454
01:30:06,144 --> 01:30:09,731
- You wha'?
- You're already in a band!

1455
01:30:09,856 --> 01:30:11,733
I've my career to think of!

1456
01:30:11,816 --> 01:30:13,360
- I have to do it!
- Wha'?

1457
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:15,487
- Break his face!
- No, no, no!

1458
01:30:18,782 --> 01:30:21,493
Stop lookin' at me knickers, you!

1459
01:30:24,829 --> 01:30:27,123
I'm fuckin' warnin' yeh! You're dead, man!

01:30:27,249 --> 01:30:28,959

- What's what?

1461
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:31,086
- That.
- It's only a haircut.

1462
01:30:31,169 --> 01:30:34,256
That's a jazz haircut.
And why aren't yeh dressed?

1463
01:30:34,381 --> 01:30:37,717
- I'm gonna wear me new suit!
- And why aren't yous changed?

1464
01:30:37,843 --> 01:30:40,762
Nobody wants to wear
fuckin' monkey suits, Jimmy.

1465
01:30:40,929 --> 01:30:44,599
- Who wants to look like The Four Tops?
- More like fuckin' undertakers!

1466
01:30:44,724 --> 01:30:46,768
Look at this!

1467
01:30:47,769 --> 01:30:49,020
What the fuck...?!

1468
01:30:49,104 --> 01:30:52,190
What are yis all lookin' at?
He only gave me a ride!

1469
01:30:52,274 --> 01:30:55,694
- I'm sure he did!
- He shagged the lot o' them.

1470
01:30:55,777 --> 01:30:58,238
How are yeh, 'Melda?

1471
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:02,075
- Jimmy, can I talk to yeh?
- Shut up, the lot o' yis! And you, Deco!

1472
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,704
Someone comin' in tonight
could make a big difference to us.

1473
01:31:05,912 --> 01:31:06,830
Gorbachev?

1474
01:31:06,913 --> 01:31:10,584
- Batman? The Pope?
- Even better. Wilson Pickett.

1475
01:31:10,834 --> 01:31:12,711
- Fuck off!
- No, he isn't!

1476
01:31:12,794 --> 01:31:17,757
- Isn't that right, Joey?
- He promised me he's gonna jam with us.

1477
01:31:17,841 --> 01:31:21,011
- Me hole, he is!
- Yeh can wear jockstraps for all I care!

1478
01:31:21,136 --> 01:31:23,513
Just behave like yeh know

01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:27,642
Wilson Pickett and Deco Cuffe,

01:31:27,726 --> 01:31:30,020
Ow! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Three Hail Marys for you tomorrow!

1482
01:31:35,233 --> 01:31:37,903
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Keep out o' this! Fuck off!

1483
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,454
Mustang Sally.

1484
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:55,837
Guess you better slow
that Mustang down.

1485
01:32:02,093 --> 01:32:04,638
Mustang Sally now, baby.

1486
01:32:08,433 --> 01:32:11,937
Guess you better slow
that Mustang down.

1487
01:32:19,402 --> 01:32:22,572
You been runnin' all over town.

1488
01:32:22,697 --> 01:32:24,574
Oo-oo-ooh.

1489
01:32:24,658 --> 01:32:30,497
Ooh, I guess you gotta put
your flat feet on the ground.

1490
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:35,585
Sing it to me one more time, girls!

1491
01:32:36,753 --> 01:32:41,007
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

1492
01:32:41,091 --> 01:32:43,635
Ride, Sally, ride.

1493
01:32:45,554 --> 01:32:49,391
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

1494
01:32:49,516 --> 01:32:52,394
Ride, Sally, ride.

1495
01:32:53,562 --> 01:32:57,858
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

1496
01:32:57,941 --> 01:33:00,569
Ride, Sally, ride.

1497
01:33:02,112 --> 01:33:06,199
All you wanna do is ride around, Sally.

1498
01:33:06,283 --> 01:33:08,952
Ride, Sally, ride.

1499
01:33:10,453 --> 01:33:13,957
One of these early mornings

1500
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,796
I'm gonna be wipin' those weepin' eyes.

1501
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,841
Yea-eah.

1502
01:33:22,924 --> 01:33:24,509
All right!

1503
01:33:27,137 --> 01:33:30,140
I bought you a brand-new Mustang.

1504
01:33:30,557 --> 01:33:31,808
Uh-huh.

1505
01:33:31,892 --> 01:33:34,436
It was a 1965.

1506
01:33:35,687 --> 01:33:39,191
Now you come around
signifying a woman.

1507
01:33:40,233 --> 01:33:43,403
Girl, you won't... you won't...
let me ride!

1508
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:45,572
Mustang Sally now, baby

1509
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:48,200
Sally now, baby.

1510
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:49,993
Tell me, Jimmy.

1511
01:33:50,076 --> 01:33:53,330
When would yeh think was the big
turning point for The Commitments?

1512
01:33:53,455 --> 01:33:55,081
Good question, Terry.

1513
01:33:55,165 --> 01:33:59,336
It has to be when Wilson Pickett
played with us in a small club in Dublin.

1514
01:33:59,419 --> 01:34:02,130
That must have been quite a thrill, Jimmy.

1515
01:34:02,506 --> 01:34:05,383
It will be if the fucker turns up, Terry.

1516
01:34:07,802 --> 01:34:09,930
Baby, they don't know.

1517
01:34:10,805 --> 01:34:13,808
That I'd leave you if I could.

1518
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:17,854
I guess I'm all tied.

1519
01:34:19,606 --> 01:34:21,650
And I'm stuck like glue.

1520
01:34:22,609 --> 01:34:23,693
Cos I ain't never.

1521
01:34:23,818 --> 01:34:24,818
Never

1522
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:25,862
I ain't never.

1523
01:34:25,987 --> 01:34:26,988
Never

1524
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,072
I ain't never.

1525
01:34:28,114 --> 01:34:28,782
Never.

1526
01:34:28,907 --> 01:34:30,367
No, no!

1527
01:34:30,617 --> 01:34:34,371
Loved a man the way that I

1528
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,207
I love you.

1529
01:34:40,168 --> 01:34:42,212
Some time ago I thought.

1530
01:34:42,838 --> 01:34:44,256
Oo-ooh.

1531
01:34:44,339 --> 01:34:46,383
Rum an' black, please.

1532
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:48,134
Oo-ooh

1533
01:34:48,218 --> 01:34:50,595
I was so wrong.

1534
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:53,932
Because you've got one
you'll never lose.

1535
01:34:56,059 --> 01:34:58,520
The way you treat me is a shame.

1536
01:34:59,938 --> 01:35:02,232
How could you hurt me so bad?

1537
01:35:04,276 --> 01:35:06,319
Baby, don't you know.

1538
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:11,074
That I'm the best thing you ever had?

1539
01:35:11,992 --> 01:35:14,202
Kiss me once again.

1540
01:35:15,412 --> 01:35:18,290
Don't you never, never say
that we're through.

1541
01:35:18,999 --> 01:35:20,417
Cos I ain't never.

1542
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,500
Never

1543
01:35:21,543 --> 01:35:22,210
I ain't never.

1544
01:35:22,335 --> 01:35:23,420
Never

1545
01:35:23,587 --> 01:35:25,297
I ain't never.

1546
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:27,174
No, no!

1547
01:35:27,299 --> 01:35:29,092
Loved a man.

1548
01:35:29,176 --> 01:35:31,469
The way that I

1549
01:35:31,595 --> 01:35:33,388
I love you.

1550
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:38,310
Oh, I can't sleep at night.

1551
01:35:40,437 --> 01:35:42,314
I can't eat a bite.

1552
01:35:43,857 --> 01:35:45,901
Guess I'll never be free.

1553
01:35:47,861 --> 01:35:49,821
Since you got.

1554
01:35:49,905 --> 01:35:51,781
Your hook.

1555
01:35:51,907 --> 01:35:53,950
In me.

1556
01:35:54,075 --> 01:35:56,119
Oh, oh, oh.

1557
01:35:56,661 --> 01:35:58,163
Yeah!

1558
01:35:58,747 --> 01:36:00,957
Yeah!

1559
01:36:01,374 --> 01:36:03,335
I ain't never loved a man, baby.

1560
01:36:03,919 --> 01:36:08,882
- Jimmy! Dougie Best, Music Weekly.
- Thanks a lot for showin' up.

1561
01:36:08,965 --> 01:36:11,843
- Is Pickett still comin'?
- Absolutely. No question.

1562
01:36:11,927 --> 01:36:16,389
You told me I was goin' to be the only
press. See a fella from The Times there.

1563
01:36:16,473 --> 01:36:20,310
Dublin's a small town. Word gets out.
Yeh know what I'm sayin'?

1564
01:36:21,144 --> 01:36:21,645
Never.

1565
01:36:21,853 --> 01:36:22,854
Never.

1566
01:36:23,146 --> 01:36:23,813
Never.

1567
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:28,401
Ne-e-e-ver.

1568
01:36:39,371 --> 01:36:40,747
Yeah.

1569
01:36:41,248 --> 01:36:42,707
Mm. Yeah.

1570
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,835
How was it?

1571
01:36:45,544 --> 01:36:48,004
Yeah. All right.

1572
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,215
OK. See yeh.

1573
01:37:01,726 --> 01:37:05,146
Oh, she may be weary.

1574
01:37:06,439 --> 01:37:09,609
And young girls, they do get weary.

1575
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:17,742
Wearin' that same old shaggy dress.

1576
01:37:22,247 --> 01:37:25,000
But when she gets weary.

1577
01:37:28,044 --> 01:37:29,671
Try.

1578
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:36,219
A little tenderness.

1579
01:37:41,474 --> 01:37:42,934
Fandango.

1580
01:37:44,561 --> 01:37:47,647
You know she's waitin'

1581
01:37:49,024 --> 01:37:51,776
Just anticipatin'

1582
01:37:52,652 --> 01:37:54,112
The things.

1583
01:37:54,321 --> 01:37:56,698
That she never, never.

1584
01:37:56,781 --> 01:37:59,701
Never, never possesses.

1585
01:37:59,784 --> 01:38:01,203
Yeah.

1586
01:38:03,288 --> 01:38:05,916
But while she's there waitin'

1587
01:38:05,999 --> 01:38:07,459
Without them.

1588
01:38:09,252 --> 01:38:13,089
Try a little tenderness.

1589
01:38:14,382 --> 01:38:16,176
That's all you gotta do.

1590
01:38:16,551 --> 01:38:18,136
This is for you.

1591
01:38:22,182 --> 01:38:23,975
It's not.

1592
01:38:24,059 --> 01:38:26,353
Just sentimental.

1593
01:38:31,274 --> 01:38:35,737
She has her grief and her cares.

1594
01:38:36,696 --> 01:38:38,740
Ye-eah, yeah.

1595
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,703
But the soft words.

1596
01:38:43,787 --> 01:38:46,957
They are spoke so gentle.

1597
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:51,169
It makes it easier.

1598
01:38:51,253 --> 01:38:55,549
Easier to bear.

1599
01:38:55,632 --> 01:38:57,342
Yeah.

1600
01:38:59,594 --> 01:39:02,305
You won't regret it, no, no.

1601
01:39:03,348 --> 01:39:05,475
Young girls, they never forget it.

1602
01:39:07,435 --> 01:39:11,022
Love is their only.

1603
01:39:11,147 --> 01:39:13,441
Happiness.

1604
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:19,197
But it's all so easy.

1605
01:39:22,284 --> 01:39:24,661
All you gotta do.

1606
01:39:24,786 --> 01:39:28,039
Is try a little tenderness.

1607
01:39:28,623 --> 01:39:29,708
Oh, yeah, baby.

1608
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:32,961
Oh, yeah.

1609
01:39:34,087 --> 01:39:35,338
Squeeze her.

1610
01:39:35,463 --> 01:39:36,464
Don't you tease her.

1611
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:37,590
Never leave her.

1612
01:39:37,632 --> 01:39:38,632
You got to.

1613
01:39:38,675 --> 01:39:39,676
You got to.

1614
01:39:39,885 --> 01:39:40,468
You got to.

1615
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:41,887
You got to.

1616
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:46,349
Try a little tenderness, yeah.

1617
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:49,227
Yeah.

1618
01:39:54,983 --> 01:39:58,570
Howayeh, Jimmy?
This is Eamon, me photographer.

1619
01:39:58,695 --> 01:40:01,072
Jaysis! Some rain, wha'?
Is Wilson here yet?

1620
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:06,077
- No. What time did the show finish?
- Ah, it's over an hour already.

1621
01:40:06,203 --> 01:40:08,580
He'll be doin' all that backstage bullshit.

1622
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:11,249
I thought he was supposed to be here.

1623
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:12,667
Never leave her.

1624
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:13,752
You got to.

1625
01:40:13,919 --> 01:40:14,586

Oh, yeah.

01:40:25,764 --> 01:40:26,681
You got to.

1632
01:40:26,765 --> 01:40:27,349
Squeeze her.

1633
01:40:27,432 --> 01:40:28,266
Don't you tease her.

1634
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:29,351
Never leave her.

1635
01:40:29,434 --> 01:40:30,435
You got to.

1636
01:40:30,644 --> 01:40:33,730
Got to, got to, got to,
got to, got to, got to.

1637
01:40:33,855 --> 01:40:36,816
Try a little tenderness.

01:40:36,983 --> 01:40:38,443
Yeah.

1639
01:40:38,527 --> 01:40:40,028
Oh, oh, oh.

01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:40,862
Whoa!

01:40:41,112 --> 01:40:41,863
Whoa!

1642
01:40:42,113 --> 01:40:43,448
Whoa!

1643
01:40:43,532 --> 01:40:45,325
You got to, you got to squeeze her.

1644
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,994
Don't you tease her, man.

1645
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:50,872
Got to, got to, got to,
got to, got to, got to.

1646
01:40:50,956 --> 01:40:54,209
Try a little tenderness.

1647
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:55,544
Yeah.

1648
01:40:55,669 --> 01:40:56,837
Oh, baby.

1649
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,088
Oh! Oh!

1650
01:40:59,714 --> 01:41:01,675
You've got to squeeze her.

1651
01:41:01,758 --> 01:41:02,759
Never leave her.

1652
01:41:02,843 --> 01:41:03,510
You got to.

1653
01:41:03,718 --> 01:41:04,386
You got to.

1654
01:41:04,469 --> 01:41:06,513
Got to, got to, got to, got to.

1655
01:41:06,596 --> 01:41:07,596
Got to, got to.

1656
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:13,144
Try a little tenderness...!

1657
01:41:13,603 --> 01:41:15,897
Oh, yeah...!

1658
01:41:15,981 --> 01:41:17,148
Yeah!

1659
01:41:41,506 --> 01:41:43,300
You don't need a new amp, Outspan!

1660
01:41:43,383 --> 01:41:46,052
- Jimmy! Is Wilson back there?
- Not yet.

1661
01:41:46,136 --> 01:41:47,762
Where the fuck is he, then?

1662
01:41:47,846 --> 01:41:50,307
Wilson Pickett! Load o' bollix!

1663
01:41:50,515 --> 01:41:53,518
It's not, Jimmy, is it?
He will come, won't he?

1664
01:41:54,978 --> 01:41:58,648
- Wilson Pickett finished an hour ago.
- I spoke to the man. I did me best.

1665
01:41:58,773 --> 01:42:01,860
You said it was no problem.
You said it was all fixed.

1666
01:42:01,985 --> 01:42:05,155
If you've been bullshittin' me,
I'll ram that trumpet up your arse!

1667
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,824
I'm sorry you doubt me, Brother Rabbitte.

1668
01:42:08,867 --> 01:42:10,994
We need roadies.

1669
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:13,079
Will yeh ever shut up, for fuck sake!

1670
01:42:13,205 --> 01:42:15,957
Who the fuck d'yeh think yeh are?

1671
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:19,586
When I come offstage I want
a proper towel, not a tea towel.

1672
01:42:19,669 --> 01:42:21,880
And a bottle of mineral water.

1673
01:42:21,963 --> 01:42:24,966
- Don't fuckin' spray that!
- Thinks he's fuckin' Prince!

1674
01:42:25,175 --> 01:42:27,552
And what's that meant to mean?

1675
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:31,890
- Are we doin' an encore?
- Not till I've had a pee. I'm desperate.

1676
01:42:31,973 --> 01:42:34,017
Are we waitin' for the
fuckin' mystery man?

1677
01:42:34,142 --> 01:42:36,770
Shut up, Charlie shaggin' Parker!

1678
01:42:36,978 --> 01:42:38,855
Is Wilson goin' to come?

1679
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:43,527
"Wilson"! You didn't know who Wilson
Pickett was a month ago, you stupid cow!

1680
01:42:43,985 --> 01:42:45,570
Don't do that!

1681
01:42:45,654 --> 01:42:47,239
You're probably goin' with him, too!

1682
01:42:47,322 --> 01:42:51,451
They're me fans! They love me!
They're my fans, not your fans.

1683
01:42:52,702 --> 01:42:55,413
Are yeh goin' to do
a fuckin' encore or not?

1684
01:42:57,415 --> 01:43:00,252
I'm goin' to fuckin' burst you!

1685
01:43:00,335 --> 01:43:03,046
Your fuckin' days are numbered! Fat slob!

1686
01:43:03,129 --> 01:43:06,466
- Go an' fuck yourself!
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1687
01:43:25,402 --> 01:43:26,778
A double Jameson's, please.

1688
01:43:29,239 --> 01:43:30,699
Hello, Dublin!

1689
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:38,874
So yous lot couldn't get tickets
to Wilson Pickett tonight, no?

1690
01:43:40,876 --> 01:43:42,669
He was supposed to come an' see us.

1691
01:43:46,047 --> 01:43:49,134
I'm serious. Only, our manager fucked up!

1692
01:43:51,178 --> 01:43:54,598
We'd like to do a Pickett song now.
Hope yeh like it.

1693
01:43:54,931 --> 01:43:56,183
Hit it!

1694
01:44:11,698 --> 01:44:15,035
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour.

1695
01:44:15,827 --> 01:44:19,080
That's when my love
comes tumblin' down

1696
01:44:19,915 --> 01:44:22,918
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour.

1697
01:44:23,919 --> 01:44:27,339
When there's no one else around

1698
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:31,551
I'm gonna take you, girl, and hold you.

1699
01:44:32,886 --> 01:44:34,930
And do all the things I told you.

1700
01:44:35,055 --> 01:44:37,724
In the midnight hour.

1701
01:44:38,475 --> 01:44:40,435
Midnight hour.

1702
01:44:40,519 --> 01:44:42,562
Oh, yeah

1703
01:44:46,233 --> 01:44:49,319
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out.

1704
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:53,907
And see that twinkle in your eye

1705
01:44:54,199 --> 01:44:56,993
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour.

1706
01:44:57,077 --> 01:44:58,078
Midnight hour.

1707
01:44:58,203 --> 01:45:01,164
That's when my love begins to shine

1708
01:45:01,623 --> 01:45:04,167
Jimmy Rabbitte?
That is a mean band yeh got there.

1709
01:45:04,292 --> 01:45:06,962
- Dave Machin, Eejit Records.
- Eejit Records?

1710
01:45:07,045 --> 01:45:10,006
- Listen, I'm very excited. Can we talk?
- Sure!

1711
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:12,217
Go somewhere a bit quieter, yeah?

1712
01:45:13,218 --> 01:45:14,928
Midnight hour.

1713
01:45:24,813 --> 01:45:31,236
Exactly, Jimmy. Eejit Records is a small
label, but we're good because we care.

1714
01:45:31,361 --> 01:45:34,865
No money upfront, but we'll pay for
an engineer and studio time for a day.

1715
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:35,991
Sounds brilliant!

1716
01:45:36,616 --> 01:45:38,994
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour.

1717
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:40,495
Midnight hour.

1718
01:45:40,579 --> 01:45:43,206
That's when my love
comes tumblin' down.

1719
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:44,916
Midnight hour

1720
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:45,709
I'm gonna wait.

1721
01:45:45,834 --> 01:45:47,085
Wait.

1722
01:45:47,169 --> 01:45:48,753
Midnight hour.

1723
01:45:48,837 --> 01:45:51,214
That's when my love begins to shine.

1724
01:45:51,339 --> 01:45:52,424
Midnight hour.

1725
01:45:52,507 --> 01:45:53,758
Just you and I.

1726
01:45:53,884 --> 01:45:55,427
Wait.

1727
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:56,344
Midnight hour.

1728
01:45:56,469 --> 01:45:57,721
Just you and I.

1729
01:45:57,846 --> 01:45:59,389
Wait.

1730
01:45:59,472 --> 01:46:00,807
Midnight hour.

1731
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:01,891
Just you and I.

1732
01:46:01,933 --> 01:46:02,933
Wait.

1733
01:46:03,351 --> 01:46:04,686
Midnight hour.

1734
01:46:04,769 --> 01:46:05,937
You and I.

1735
01:46:06,062 --> 01:46:07,062
Wait.

1736
01:46:07,397 --> 01:46:08,398
Midnight hour.

1737
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:10,692
Just you and I.

1738
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:12,819
Yeah.

1739
01:46:13,278 --> 01:46:16,281
Yeah...!

1740
01:46:41,848 --> 01:46:45,769
- We were good, Steven, weren't we?
- Fuckin' deadly!

1741
01:46:45,894 --> 01:46:48,688
- Hey, Joey, what about tha'!
- We were brilliant!

1742
01:46:48,772 --> 01:46:51,233
- Not tossers, wha'?
- I was good, wasn't I?

1743
01:46:51,358 --> 01:46:54,694
- You were good?
- My chords was good!

1744
01:46:54,819 --> 01:46:58,573
- Give it to Natalie! She had him first!
- I'd piss in his helmet if I was you!

1745
01:46:58,698 --> 01:47:00,242
Fuckin' take it!

1746
01:47:00,325 --> 01:47:04,162
You're the one that had your fuckin'
tongue rammed down his throat!

1747
01:47:04,871 --> 01:47:09,334
Can you believe this? They're
fightin' over the little fucker now!

1748
01:47:09,459 --> 01:47:12,170
You started this!
You and your fuckin' dick!

1749
01:47:12,254 --> 01:47:14,297
- I am gone.
- No one's had me!

1750
01:47:14,422 --> 01:47:16,716
It's lmelda. She's such a prick teaser.

1751
01:47:16,842 --> 01:47:19,302
Don't call me a fuckin' prick teaser!

1752
01:47:23,265 --> 01:47:24,724
Give over, all o' yeh!

1753
01:47:25,016 --> 01:47:27,978
I've said it before, and I'll
say it again. I'm very excited.

1754
01:47:28,395 --> 01:47:31,815
But is there any problems with the band?
They were slaggin' you off a bit.

1755
01:47:31,898 --> 01:47:36,111
No, no, no, Dave.
You know how it is in rock'n'roll.

1756
01:47:36,194 --> 01:47:39,614
Once they get a taste,
they become overnight arseholes.

1757
01:47:39,739 --> 01:47:42,284
Isn't everybody in rock'n'roll an arsehole!

1758
01:47:42,367 --> 01:47:44,578
Except for management, that is.

1759
01:47:52,544 --> 01:47:55,547
All right! All right!

1760
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:58,175
- Autographs now, is it?
- At least I can write me own name!

1761
01:47:58,258 --> 01:48:00,385
You're a smart boy, yeah?

1762
01:48:00,468 --> 01:48:02,929
Don't start me now. Don't fuckin' start me.

1763
01:48:03,013 --> 01:48:04,598
Don't fuckin' start me!

1764
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:07,350
Don't start me! Don't start me! Don't...

1765
01:48:25,911 --> 01:48:29,831
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, get up here!
They're murderin' each other!

1766
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:31,290
Bastard!

1767
01:48:32,626 --> 01:48:34,085
Fucker!

1768
01:48:35,504 --> 01:48:37,005
What the fuck is goin' on?!

1769
01:48:37,088 --> 01:48:39,382
- The usual.
- I turn my back for 30 seconds!

1770
01:48:39,466 --> 01:48:41,927
- I'm leavin' this fuckin' band!
- Me, too!

1771
01:48:42,052 --> 01:48:46,306
Not one of yis has ever seen me
as anythin' but a bum and a skirt!

1772
01:48:53,522 --> 01:48:55,982
Fuck yis. Fuck the lot o' yis.

1773
01:48:58,026 --> 01:48:59,486
Arsehole! Fuck off!

1774
01:49:05,367 --> 01:49:08,119
Ohh... My God! Jesus Christ!

1775
01:49:08,203 --> 01:49:11,373
- Are yeh all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

1776
01:49:12,123 --> 01:49:14,167
Can I have your autograph?

1777
01:49:28,265 --> 01:49:30,475
Jimmy! D'yeh want a ride?

1778
01:49:30,559 --> 01:49:31,935
Piss off!

1779
01:49:32,018 --> 01:49:34,729
Look, don't take it personally, Jimmy.

1780
01:49:35,355 --> 01:49:37,315
They'll all come crawlin' back.

1781
01:49:37,399 --> 01:49:39,693
They can crawl up their holes
for all I care!

1782
01:49:39,818 --> 01:49:43,238
O sing unto the Lord a new song,
for he's done marvellous things.

1783
01:49:43,363 --> 01:49:44,781
Psalm 98.

1784
01:49:44,865 --> 01:49:50,871
You lied to me, Joey! I always bought
everythin' you told us! But you lied to me!

1785
01:49:50,954 --> 01:49:53,248
I'm sorry you doubt me, Brother Rabbitte.

1786
01:49:53,373 --> 01:49:56,710
In time you'll realise
what you've achieved.

1787
01:49:56,835 --> 01:49:59,713
- I've achieved nothin'!
- You're missing the point!

1788
01:49:59,796 --> 01:50:02,007
The success of the band was irrelevant!

1789
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:06,136
You raised their expectations of life!
You lifted their horizons!

1790
01:50:06,219 --> 01:50:11,349
Sure, we could have been famous,
but that would have been predictable.

1791
01:50:11,433 --> 01:50:13,977
This way it's poetry.

1792
01:50:14,186 --> 01:50:16,897
It's a pisser is what it is, Joey.

1793
01:50:42,088 --> 01:50:45,342
Hey, man... you know a nightclub
called Gallagher's?

1794
01:50:45,467 --> 01:50:48,970
Yeah, it's just around the corner,
but it's closed now.

1795
01:50:49,054 --> 01:50:51,765
Should we go back
to the hotel, Mr Pickett?

1796
01:50:51,848 --> 01:50:53,099
OK.

1797
01:50:57,187 --> 01:50:58,813
Fuck!

1798
01:51:16,289 --> 01:51:19,042
So how did you feel at the time, Jimmy?

1799
01:51:19,125 --> 01:51:21,586
Well, sick, I can tell yeh, Terry.

1800
01:51:21,711 --> 01:51:24,714
What happened to everybody
after you split up?

1801
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,759
Well, all sorts of things, Terry.

1802
01:51:28,593 --> 01:51:32,347
I still see Derek and Outspan.
They're still in the music business.

1803
01:51:32,472 --> 01:51:34,766
Mostly in Grafton Street.

1804
01:51:34,891 --> 01:51:37,811
I try to help them out whenever I can.

1805
01:51:37,894 --> 01:51:39,062
And Bernie,

1806
01:51:39,187 --> 01:51:42,065
last I heard, she was in
a country and western band.

1807
01:51:42,148 --> 01:51:46,194
But you know Bernie. Nice girl,
but she had terrible taste in music.

1808
01:51:46,736 --> 01:51:49,656
And, of course, Dean is still
playin' tossers' music.

1809
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:53,326
Although, I must admit,
he got quite good in the end.

1810
01:51:54,411 --> 01:51:57,247
And Billy?
What happened to him, Jimmy?

1811
01:51:57,330 --> 01:52:03,503
God knows, Terry. The last I heard, he'd
been kicked in the head shoeing a horse.

1812
01:52:04,045 --> 01:52:07,799
Steven became a doctor, of course.
But he says he misses the music.

1813
01:52:07,924 --> 01:52:08,924
Say...

1814
01:52:11,803 --> 01:52:13,388
And Mickah?

1815
01:52:13,471 --> 01:52:16,099
He has his own band,
believe it or not, Terry.

1816
01:52:16,183 --> 01:52:19,269
Quite a success, considering
he should be locked up.

1817
01:52:21,188 --> 01:52:25,358
Imelda married dopey Greg.
There's a kid on the way, apparently.

1818
01:52:25,442 --> 01:52:29,196
He won't let her sing any more.
Shame, really. She had a nice voice.

1819
01:52:31,907 --> 01:52:36,536
Deco got his recording contract.
He's an even bigger prick now.

1820
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:39,164
Oh! Excuse my language, Terry.

1821
01:52:39,497 --> 01:52:41,208
How about Natalie, Jimmy?

1822
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:44,002
She became very successful,
as you know, Terry.

1823
01:52:44,085 --> 01:52:45,795
Is it true about you and her?

1824
01:52:45,921 --> 01:52:48,298
Don't believe all you read
in the papers, Terry!

1825
01:52:48,381 --> 01:52:51,259
But, yes, it's true to say
we are fond of one another.

1826
01:52:51,676 --> 01:52:54,513
And Joey?
What happened to him, Jimmy?

1827
01:52:54,596 --> 01:52:59,309
Natalie saw his mum the other day, Terry.
She said she had a postcard from him.

1828
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,395
He was playin' with Joe Tex
on a North American tour.

1829
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,649
Only thing is, Terry, Joe Tex died in 1982.

1830
01:53:05,982 --> 01:53:07,692
So, lookin' back, Jimmy,

1831
01:53:07,776 --> 01:53:11,780
what have you learned from your
experience with The Commitments?

1832
01:53:11,863 --> 01:53:15,700
Well, that's a tricky question, Terry.
But, as I always say,

1833
01:53:15,825 --> 01:53:20,539
we skipped the light fandango,
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor.

1834
01:53:20,747 --> 01:53:25,377
I was feelin' kinda seasick,
but the crowd called out for more.

1835
01:53:25,836 --> 01:53:29,005
That's very profound, Jimmy!
What does it mean?

1836
01:53:30,423 --> 01:53:32,217
I'm fucked if I know, Terry!

1837
01:53:32,342 --> 01:53:33,969
All you've gotta do.

1838
01:53:34,553 --> 01:53:38,306
Is try a little tenderness.

1839
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:39,975
Oh, yeah, baby.

1840
01:53:40,058 --> 01:53:43,019
Oh, yeah.

1841
01:53:44,145 --> 01:53:44,980
Squeeze her.

1842
01:53:45,105 --> 01:53:46,022
Don't you tease her.

1843
01:53:46,106 --> 01:53:47,106
Never leave her.

1844
01:53:47,148 --> 01:53:48,149
You got to.

1845
01:53:48,358 --> 01:53:49,358
You got to.

1846
01:53:49,442 --> 01:53:50,442
You got to.

1847
01:53:50,527 --> 01:53:51,528
You got to.

1848
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:54,781
Try a little tenderness.

1849
01:53:54,865 --> 01:53:56,116
Yeah.

1850
01:53:56,366 --> 01:53:57,450
Oh, babe.

1851
01:53:57,659 --> 01:53:58,326
Oh.

1852
01:53:58,493 --> 01:54:00,620
Oh, yeah.

1853
01:54:00,704 --> 01:54:01,705
You got to.

1854
01:54:01,788 --> 01:54:02,622
Squeeze her.

1855
01:54:02,706 --> 01:54:03,790
Never leave her.

1856
01:54:03,874 --> 01:54:04,541
You got to.

1857
01:54:04,749 --> 01:54:05,333
You got to.

1858
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,251
Got to, got to.

1859
01:54:06,459 --> 01:54:08,670
Got to, got to, got to, got to.

1860
01:54:08,753 --> 01:54:11,464
Try a little tenderness.

1861
01:54:11,548 --> 01:54:13,341
Yeah, yeah.

1862
01:54:13,425 --> 01:54:14,426
Oh, yeah.

1863
01:54:14,509 --> 01:54:16,970
Yeah, ye-ah!

1864
01:54:17,095 --> 01:54:18,095
Yeah!

1865
01:54:22,309 --> 01:54:24,269
Ha-ha!

1866
01:54:24,352 --> 01:54:26,396
Yeah, my man!
