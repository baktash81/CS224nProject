1
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,272
Miller, they're ready for you.

2
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,728
Sneaker, you're late.

3
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,930
I had to run.

4
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,031
Run faster.

5
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,200
Get a move on, Sanchez.

6
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,901
That car's got to
be ready by 3:00.

7
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,369
All right, boss.

8
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,799
- What's up, man?
- What's up, brother?

9
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,588
Damn it.

10
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,057
<i>You couldn't
tell me this last week?</i>

11
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,458
<i>I looked at
the brakes last week.</i>

12
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,126
<i>- They looked good then, I...
- Oh, "good then"?</i>

13
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,561
I'm not playing with you, boy.

14
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,896
Go get Joey for me.

15
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,964
You want me to get him?

16
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,465
Yeah, go get Joey now,
all right?

17
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,700
I looked at the brakes,
and I'm telling you...

18
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:55,934
Oh, you didn't look
at the brakes, all right?

19
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,035
They did, they looked good.

20
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,136
No, you didn't look
at the brakes...

21
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,772
Last week your mom needed
the car and the bus was late.

22
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,075
- Bus wasn't running today.
- Look, sneaker.

23
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,910
- It's Jaden.
- That's twice already.

24
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,878
You been here a month.

25
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,715
One more thing, you're gone.

26
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,650
Now you get
the hell out of here!

27
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,755
<i>Ramirez was finally released</i>

28
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,823
<i>from the ICU yesterday</i>

29
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,559
<i>and said you were
his most frequent visitor.</i>

30
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,793
<i>Not his fault that his manager</i>

31
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,928
<i>made a bad decision.</i>

32
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,463
<i>Ramirez was the second opponent</i>

33
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,664
<i>you've hospitalized,</i>

34
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,600
<i>and still you've never even
been knocked down.</i>

35
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,768
<i>Is it true?</i>

36
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,069
<i>Are you just undefeatable?</i>

37
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,305
<i>I guess
no one's found my weakness.</i>

38
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,667
<i>We'll see
what happens next week.</i>

39
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,608
<i>Good luck.</i>

40
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,976
<i>Thank you.</i>

41
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,146
Sneaks. You gonna punch out?

42
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,514
Yeah, I'm sorry.

43
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,296
Yo, J. You need a ride?

44
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,832
Yeah. Cool.

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,170
You know, you're the only one
that calls me by my name.

46
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,638
Hell, I'm the only one

47
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,973
that knows your name.

48
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,392
Still live at your mom's, huh?

49
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,162
Can't afford
the rent on her own, you know.

50
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,965
Oh, man. I understand.
Tough times.

51
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,902
Yeah.

52
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,071
Well, uh,
thanks for the ride, man.

53
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,508
And, J...

54
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,844
Be on time tomorrow.

55
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,347
Yeah.

56
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,975
Oh, Jesus.

57
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,981
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

58
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,118
Get out of there.

59
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,358
Yeah?

60
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,661
At least I'm not late, right?

61
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,698
He's not late.

62
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,137
<i>Stay as long as you need.</i>

63
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,055
Joe's gonna kill me

64
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,990
if I don't get that oil
out of my suit.

65
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,659
There's a laundromat
on prospect, man.

66
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,861
They get anything out.

67
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,863
The address is on the fridge.

68
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,240
Hey, I dropped a suit off
in here before.

69
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,374
You know where the guy is?

70
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,612
Uh, Duane. Um, in...
In the market.

71
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,615
Should I wait in here?

72
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,884
He's been there a while...

73
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,655
The one on the corner?

74
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,924
The red and yellow sign.

75
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,160
He's probably sitting
to the... in the door

76
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,995
to the left of the...

77
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,732
- All right, thanks.
<i>- SÃ­, bueno.</i>

78
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,818
Hey, do you know
where the laundry guy is?

79
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,814
You know that guy?
Banging there?

80
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,415
You're hearing banging?

81
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,683
That guy, crazy guy back there?

82
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,019
Every day the same thing.

83
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,487
- Thanks.
- He's crazy, man.

84
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,661
Uh, Duane?

85
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,529
I just came by to pick up my...

86
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,764
Hold on.

87
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,470
Yo! The machine's broke again.

88
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,704
And this time it's mine.

89
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,173
Let me see. Let me see.

90
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,016
Quarters are mine, gum is yours.

91
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,173
Let's go.

92
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,491
What? I just do that
when it gets slow.

93
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,994
I do lottery tickets.

94
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,062
That's dumb.

95
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,497
Lottery.

96
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,173
Feet.

97
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,080
What is it?

98
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,016
It's a pack of gum
wrapped in a 20.

99
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,587
I got a spot
20 blocks from here,

100
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,756
I just heard
they got 50s and 100s.

101
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,527
This all from today?

102
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:18,703
Twelve bucks.

103
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,578
What's up, Duane?

104
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,249
There's a boxing gym
across the street, huh?

105
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,422
Can you just walk in there or...

106
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,324
Five bucks a day.
20 bucks a month.

107
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,894
Cool. Thanks.

108
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,612
Oh, man, you're crazy, dog.

109
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,443
Right.

110
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,611
Hey yo, J.

111
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,447
- Yeah.
- We're all gonna go down

112
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,782
and check out
my boy's fight tonight.

113
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,017
You down?

114
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,386
What kind of fight?

115
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:45,123
Boxing, bro.
Come on, you know I'm a boxer.

116
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,191
I mean, I knew you boxed.

117
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,292
I didn't know you were a boxer.

118
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,726
Oh, homeboy said you box,

119
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,628
but you ain't no boxer.

120
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,197
Man, shut up!

121
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,298
Dumbass.

122
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,465
What? Is that not what he said?

123
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,301
That's not what I meant.

124
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:01,072
So, is that how you make
that extra cash?

125
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,176
I mean, it's not much.

126
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,979
But it helps.

127
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,183
What do you guys think?

128
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,853
This guy any better than you?

129
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,189
It'll be a good fight.
I promise you.

130
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,998
Get up and fight.

131
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,234
That's it! Stop!

132
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,404
Well, it lasted
longer than I thought.

133
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,207
<i>Winner by way of knockout,</i>

134
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,376
<i>and still your
champion of the Bronx,</i>

135
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,712
<i>Manuel Rodriguez.</i>

136
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,180
I thought you said he was good.

137
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,449
He is.
This Rodriguez guy must be...

138
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,117
Must be a hell of a lot better.

139
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,452
You cannot do that
with that guy.

140
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,953
I told you that too many times.

141
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,855
Yeah, well, the next fight's
got to be better than that.

142
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,390
We staying for
another ass-whooping, man?

143
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,458
Of course.

144
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,927
- J?
- Guess not.

145
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,062
Fists in front
of the face, firm.

146
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,632
Off the ropes. All you do
is rotate. You don't listen.

147
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Damn it.

148
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,269
You could have beaten that guy.

149
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,070
So could my girlfriend.

150
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,273
Did not listen,
that's why you lost.

151
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,575
Excuse me.

152
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,043
Excuse me.

153
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,712
Lottery ticket?
What're you doing here?

154
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,814
Dt. This is J. J, this is...

155
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,449
Duane, I know.

156
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,784
You guys know each other?

157
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,085
It's Mr. Taylor.

158
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,121
That's your gym, isn't it?

159
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,658
What do you want?

160
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,761
I want you to train me.

161
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,396
In what, tennis?

162
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,232
I don't train rookies.

163
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,668
- I got experience.
- Come on, sneaks.

164
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,710
No, I do. Fighting, but...

165
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,840
Look... I'm not good at

166
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,443
many things, Mr. Taylor,
all right? But, I can do this.

167
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,511
I know I can.

168
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,452
Lottery tickets, huh?

169
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,990
6:00 tomorrow.
You know where it is.

170
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,859
I'll see what you can do.

171
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,529
Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
You won't regret it.

172
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,863
You serious? You really gonna
train this guy?

173
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,699
That's 6:00 A.M., understood?

174
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,033
Yes, sir, I'll be there.

175
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,202
All right.
Terrence, see you Monday.

176
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,471
Yeah, coach.

177
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,772
Come on, dt!

178
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,008
So, you're a boxer now, huh?

179
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,712
I didn't even know you boxed.

180
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,815
Yeah, well. I don't, yet.

181
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,117
You're killing me, man.

182
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,152
Turn your hips
into those punches.

183
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,888
Morning.

184
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,857
You're early.

185
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,494
You're late.

186
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,928
When did you get here?

187
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,163
Around 5:30.

188
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,998
Good. You should be
warmed up then.

189
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,533
Well, I mean, I was just...

190
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,036
Whoa, hold on.
First thing's first, lottery.

191
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,437
This ain't fighting.

192
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,073
Boxing is one of the hardest
sports in the world.

193
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,075
It requires endurance, strategy,

194
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,176
technique.

195
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,046
I'm not looking for a fighter.

196
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,453
Show me your stance.

197
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:40,024
Feet shoulder-width apart.
Left foot forward.

198
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,428
Spread your feet
like a triangle.

199
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,862
Back foot always up.

200
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,267
These up, firm.

201
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,203
Okay. Throw a punch.

202
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,610
- What was that?
- What do you mean?

203
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,746
That's a straight right.
It's a power punch.

204
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,247
Where's the power?

205
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,885
Where does the power
in that punch come from?

206
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,221
- My arms.
- That's a jab, rookie.

207
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,557
Power punches
aren't thrown with your arms.

208
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,991
Okay, we're gonna
try this again.

209
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,794
This time, rotate your hips,

210
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,398
and shift your weight from
your back foot to your front.

211
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,766
Snap back immediately

212
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,668
and return to
defensive position.

213
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,641
Okay. Again.

214
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,779
Hips. Again.

215
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,248
Harder.

216
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,783
Hips!

217
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,118
Swing your hips again.

218
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,686
Harder!

219
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,287
Harder, hips.

220
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,655
Again!

221
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,756
Harder!

222
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,160
Okay.

223
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,264
So, why are you here, kid?

224
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,604
I don't know.
I want to be somebody.

225
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,107
Sick of playing the lottery.

226
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,480
What'd you mean when you said
you used to fight?

227
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,986
I was 11. Was gonna start
private school in the fall.

228
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:16,821
And then I, uh,

229
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,456
got in my first fight.

230
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,191
Got kicked out of school.

231
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,160
Lost the scholarship.

232
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,131
Got in more schools,
more fights...

233
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,233
Never finished high school.

234
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,171
Never finished anything really.

235
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,008
Been job-to-job ever since.

236
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,075
Why do you fight?

237
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,014
The right reasons.

238
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,482
You win?

239
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:45,983
Always.

240
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:52,523
I don't, uh,
train boxers anymore.

241
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,358
What do you mean? What about...

242
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,893
What about Maxwell and Terrence?

243
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,396
Exactly. I really
just run the laundromat.

244
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,900
My last real boxer
was Keenan Anderson.

245
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,836
After four years,

246
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,172
we were finally
gonna get a shot at the title.

247
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,108
But the other manager needed
a win for one of his fighters.

248
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,513
So, I matched him up
with another one of my guys.

249
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,581
Malik Jones.

250
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,449
He threw that fight. I remember.

251
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,585
In three months,

252
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,054
I lost two fighters
and my reputation.

253
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,924
I'm sorry.

254
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,729
It's like playing
the lottery, kid. Dumb.

255
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,734
So, that's why
they call you "sneaks"?

256
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,738
Yeah.

257
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,641
When you come in here tomorrow,

258
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,309
I want you to get some new ones.

259
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,144
Tomorrow?

260
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,883
Those things
will ruin your back.

261
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,388
So, uh... that means
you're gonna train me.

262
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,628
I think it's time Hector
did some damn work

263
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,962
at that laundromat.

264
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,269
Thank you.

265
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,273
Okay.

266
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:22,113
So, um... I never got your
full name, or is it just "j"?

267
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:26,851
No, it's... it's Jaden.
Jaden Miller.

268
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,453
Jaden Miller?

269
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,460
Well, Jaden. Same time tomorrow?

270
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,462
Yes, sir. I'll be here.

271
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,930
All right.

272
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,806
Jaden Miller.

273
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,449
<i>Jaden Miller,
have you lost your mind?</i>

274
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,117
I need to get us back home, ma.

275
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,153
No. Not like that, J. No.

276
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,621
Uh, excuse me,
this ain't your place.

277
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,489
So, look. You go to this...
Uh, trainer...

278
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,291
I can't even watch
my own damn TV.

279
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,027
Regina, please. Hush, Regina.

280
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,729
Go and tell this man

281
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,831
that you're not
doing this anymore,

282
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,965
you're not trying this.

283
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,034
- But, ma, I...
- Promise me, honey.

284
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,705
Look, I am proud that
you're doing good on your job.

285
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,139
See, that's how you help.

286
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,342
Another week,
I'll have enough money,

287
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,409
and we can get...

288
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,577
Get the hell out of here.

289
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,212
- Regina, please.
- What?

290
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,481
It's only gonna be a few days.

291
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,083
And whose couch
were you sleeping on

292
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,851
before you moved into
this place?

293
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,353
- Couch?
- That's right.

294
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,254
That thing was
plywood with a cushion.

295
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,336
- Oh, so now you're...
- That thing ain't no couch...

296
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,861
<i>That marks the champ's
sixth straight title defense,</i>

297
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,163
<i>and still
renders him undefeated.</i>

298
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,264
<i>It begs the question,</i>

299
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,699
<i>is there a challenger out there</i>

300
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,867
<i>that can beat him?</i>

301
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,535
<i>Damien Wright sure thought so,</i>

302
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,171
<i>but as we saw last night,
Wright was proven wrong.</i>

303
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,855
When are you gonna find me
a real challenger, Vin?

304
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,690
Keep embarrassing them like that

305
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,458
and no one will fight you.

306
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,895
I can't change the way I fight,

307
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,230
you know that.

308
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,467
Maybe you can find
someone who can.

309
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,707
<i>One, two!</i>

310
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,976
One, two! One, two!

311
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,545
One, two! Come on!
Why you holding back?

312
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,746
- One, two!
- I'm not!

313
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,381
One, two! One, two!

314
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,463
You're hitting like a girl.

315
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,251
One, two! One, two!

316
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,952
One, two! Stop holding back.

317
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,888
- One, two!
- I'm not!

318
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,656
So you do have a pulse.

319
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,992
I'm doing my best, all right?

320
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,560
No.

321
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,797
- What do you want from me?
- Your best.

322
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
You want to tell me
what's going on?

323
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,336
What are you afraid of, huh?

324
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,273
What are you afraid of?

325
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,848
What the hell am I doing

326
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,750
wasting my time with you?

327
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,951
You think I came back to boxing

328
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,352
to get embarrassed again?

329
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,623
Look, my mom doesn't know
I'm here, all right?

330
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,592
- She doesn't want me fighting.
- Oh.

331
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,993
Mama's boy.

332
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,595
How long you gonna keep that up?

333
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,866
You want to keep living
from job-to-job, fine.

334
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,602
But I've seen too many boxers
waste their talent,

335
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,104
waste their lives,
because they were afraid.

336
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
Afraid of losing. But mostly,

337
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,142
afraid of winning.

338
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,111
You can be great
and you're already quitting.

339
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,714
If you don't stand up and fight

340
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,016
for who you are now, right now,

341
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,818
you never will.

342
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,056
I better not see you
in here tomorrow.

343
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,893
I'm here, all right? I'm ready.

344
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,299
I'm ready!

345
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,536
Really?

346
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,145
Show me.

347
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,056
One, two! One, two!
One, two! One, two!

348
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,425
One, two! Come on!
One, two! Harder!

349
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:37,261
<i>One, two! One, two!
Harder! Harder, come on!</i>

350
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:39,797
<i>Keep moving.</i>

351
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,799
<i>You can't stop.
Ain't no days off.</i>

352
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:42,933
<i>I told you that.</i>

353
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,469
<i>You wanna be the champ,
that's what you got to do.</i>

354
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,806
Harder! Harder, come on!

355
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:53,811
<i>Let's go!</i>

356
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,513
One, two! One, two!

357
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,682
One, two! One, two! One, two!

358
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,818
One, two! Come on!
One, two! Harder!

359
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,596
<i>Where do you wanna be?
Where do you wanna be?</i>

360
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,124
<i>Come on.</i>

361
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,459
<i>That's how you got to work.</i>

362
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,261
<i>Got to keep working.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

363
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,630
<i>That's how you do it.</i>

364
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,198
<i>That's what you need.</i>

365
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,633
<i>Don't be out-worked.</i>

366
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,369
<i>Maybe outclassed,
maybe out-techniqued,</i>

367
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,771
<i>but don't be out-worked.</i>

368
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,840
<i>You got to train like that.
You can't get tired.</i>

369
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:24,775
<i>It's endurance,</i>

370
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,444
<i>technique, strategy.</i>

371
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,780
<i>Ain't no days off. Keep working.</i>

372
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,983
<i>One, two! One, two!
One, two! One, two!</i>

373
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,985
<i>Hips! Hips! Harder!</i>

374
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,855
<i>Harder! Keep moving!</i>

375
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,864
<i>One, two! Come on!
50 more seconds.</i>

376
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,860
<i>Last round! Last round!</i>

377
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,062
<i>Last round! Last round!</i>

378
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,163
<i>One, two! Hips!</i>

379
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,032
<i>Hips! Let's go.</i>

380
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,000
Come on! How do you
want to be remembered?

381
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,202
Champ or chump?

382
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,085
How do you
want to be remembered?

383
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,007
Huh?
What do you want out of life?

384
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,010
Switch it, go around, go around!

385
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,518
Let's go, come on,
give me 10 more seconds.

386
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,022
<i>Come on, five more!</i>

387
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,191
Five more for the championship.

388
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,327
Three! The champ is here!

389
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,363
Two, one. Time!

390
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,373
Show me something now.
Yeah, there you go.

391
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,241
Can't play hockey

392
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,523
till you know
how to skate, baby.

393
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,912
Whatever direction
you're going in,

394
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,046
that foot leads.

395
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,248
You need hips to throw a punch

396
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,683
and balance to throw your hips.

397
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,190
- Damn!
- Hold on, let's try something.

398
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,869
Hear that?

399
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,038
Yeah. Okay?

400
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:06,577
Try no hands.
React to your opponent.

401
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,644
Dance.

402
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,048
Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,783
No hands.

404
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,752
There you go. Sway.

405
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,954
Back and forth.
He can't touch you.

406
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:18,589
Down, down, back and forth.

407
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,892
There you go.

408
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,295
What's the difference
between a fight and boxing?

409
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,265
Endurance!

410
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,735
Strategy.

411
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:34,004
Technique.

412
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,806
Yeah.

413
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,408
Come on, come on, that's right.

414
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,930
Move. Move your hands,
move your hands.

415
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,580
There you go.
That's it, that's it.

416
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,149
Yeah.

417
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,184
Good work, fellas, good work.

418
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,853
Sway the hips though,
there you go.

419
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,124
Okay, that's good.
That's it for now.

420
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,004
Great fighters.

421
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,540
Yeah.

422
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,710
You wanted to see me?

423
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,279
I think you're ready
for your first fight.

424
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,513
What do you think?

425
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:19,983
Yeah, sure.

426
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,489
It's the only one in a frame.

427
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,692
It's the only one worth framing.

428
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,661
That's Derrick Taylor.

429
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,197
Man trained me
since I was a kid.

430
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,733
Knew more about the sport
than anyone.

431
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,002
Never made it as a boxer, but...

432
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,805
He was a great man.
A great father.

433
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,811
He used to say that great
boxing was more of a dance

434
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,213
than a fight.

435
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,848
- A dance?
- Yeah.

436
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,684
One leads.
The other one follows.

437
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,219
And then it switches.

438
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,920
You get two great

439
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,755
equally matched boxers
in the ring,

440
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,390
and it's choreography.

441
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,326
It's beautiful.

442
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,229
You ever see
something like that?

443
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,531
Hmm. Once...

444
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,733
1971.

445
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,568
Ali, Frazier.

446
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,571
They called it
"the fight of the century."

447
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,208
Pop got us tickets
for my seventh birthday.

448
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,912
I never knew what he meant
until I saw that fight.

449
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,914
Lasted a full 15.

450
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,683
Ali was quick and agile.

451
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,186
And Frazier was a powerhouse.

452
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,055
It was 15 rounds of...

453
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,758
Dance.

454
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,028
That was real boxing.

455
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,631
Boxing ain't what it used to be.

456
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,234
You can't have great fights
without great fighters,

457
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,370
and it takes more than
knowledge to be great.

458
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,772
It takes something special.

459
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,709
Pop and I never had it.

460
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,047
I think you just might.

461
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,118
Get some rest.

462
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,943
I'm on a stairway
to heaven right here.

463
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,245
Stairway to heaven, baby.
That's what we want.

464
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,014
All these steps
lead to something.

465
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,517
All these steps lead
to a better life.

466
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,352
Pretty soon,
it's gonna be the big venues,

467
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,120
ain't gonna be
this place no more.

468
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,358
All right.

469
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,094
Get to your feet
as soon as you can.

470
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,629
Control yourself,

471
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,431
control the fight.

472
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,967
And throw those hips, rotate.

473
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,203
Okay, you can do this.
You're ready? There you go.

474
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,371
Let's go do it.

475
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,445
<i>And here's tonight's challenger,</i>

476
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,980
<i>Jaden Miller.</i>

477
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,619
You're ready. Stay ready.

478
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,690
Come on, get up in there.

479
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,129
Get in there. Get loose.

480
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,965
<i>Newcomer Jaden Miller
enters the ring.</i>

481
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:26,670
<i>And here's</i>

482
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,172
<i>your champ of the Bronx,
Manuel Rodriguez.</i>

483
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,643
Stay warm, stay warm, baby.

484
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,647
Move around, baby. Get ready.
Get ready. Get ready.

485
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,749
Make sure you're tough now.

486
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,183
Make sure you're tough.

487
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,718
That's it. Let's do it.
Let's do it.

488
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,086
Move around, get ready.

489
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,557
<i>Champ of
the Bronx, Manuel Rodriguez,</i>

490
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,926
<i>clearly looking for
another stepping stone here.</i>

491
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,229
All right, come on,
let's go, baby, come on.

492
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,999
You sure about starting him
with Rodriguez, coach?

493
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,101
Yeah.

494
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,570
Gentlemen. Give me
a good, clean fight.

495
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,272
Obey my commands at all times.

496
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:03,774
And protect yourself
at all times.

497
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,409
And at this time,
I want you to touch gloves.

498
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,010
Touch gloves!

499
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:10,847
Back to your corners.
Good luck to both.

500
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,955
Box!

501
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,535
Get your feet. Get your feet!

502
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,049
Come on! Get off those ropes!

503
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:48,552
Feet! Feet!

504
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,391
The crowd loves you, Jaden.
It's you!

505
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,061
Five, six,

506
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,831
seven, eight...

507
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,501
Box!

508
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,681
Fists cover the face! Firm!

509
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,985
Move, baby, move!

510
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,654
Put him down! Put him down!

511
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,624
Right now!

512
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,261
Hips!

513
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,532
That's it!

514
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:42,806
Out!

515
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,669
Check this refrigerator.

516
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,804
I bet you there's some
science projects in here.

517
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,708
It's still buzzing.

518
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,245
Check the sink.

519
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,514
Oh, he fixed the sink.

520
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,683
Oh, that Joe is a good guy.

521
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,851
Those extra hours

522
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,452
really paid off, Jaden.

523
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,090
Ah, well, let me get my coat off

524
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,325
and get going. Whoo...

525
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,027
I am so glad to get away
from Regina,

526
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,395
I don't know what to do.

527
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:41,231
That girl was about ready to
drive me crazy.

528
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,867
It's good to be home, baby.

529
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,068
Yeah, it is.

530
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:50,540
Get this stuff going.
And then I can mop the floor.

531
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,243
Get those dishes,

532
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,611
get us some food.

533
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,980
'Cause Regina can't cook either.

534
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,249
Ooh, that girl is toppy.

535
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,136
<i>Bronx boxing
is making a comeback</i>

536
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,905
<i>and there's a new kid in town.</i>

537
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,074
<i>Last month,
he took Rodriguez down</i>

538
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,208
<i>in one round.</i>

539
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,478
<i>He fights again tonight.
Willis Avenue boxing gym.</i>

540
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,614
<i>8:00, the Bronx boy.</i>

541
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:31,815
<i>- Check him out.</i>
- Yeah.

542
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,751
Come on! Pick your punches!

543
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,786
Pick your punches!

544
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,755
Let's go. Get going!

545
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,323
Come on! Hips!

546
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,826
Endurance!

547
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,730
Yeah!

548
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,932
Good work, Jaden!

549
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,168
<i>The winner,
by way of knockout...</i>

550
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,970
<i>The Bronx boy, Jaden...</i>

551
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,273
<i>- Jaden...
- Jaden Miller!</i>

552
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,645
- Down!
- Look at those feet!

553
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,981
Stop showing off!

554
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:10,153
Five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10.

555
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,555
<i>Out!</i>

556
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,691
Whoo! Woohoo!

557
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,029
There you go!

558
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,357
Oil's good, man.
I checked it already.

559
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,660
I can tell you've done
a lot of work today.

560
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,663
I make this look easy, bro.

561
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,699
I can't believe he still
keeps you around.

562
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,534
- Terrence?
- Oh...

563
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,170
- Hey.
- Hey, Ms. Miller...

564
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,304
Hey, baby.

565
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,806
What are you doing here?

566
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,541
Well, my car's acting funny,

567
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:05,842
so I thought I'd bring it by

568
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,478
for Jaden to look at it.
Uh, he free?

569
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,749
Um, actually Jaden is...

570
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,580
Hey, ma. Check this out.

571
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:44,781
No more buzzing.

572
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,283
Where did you get the money
for that, j?

573
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,519
I told you, I picked up

574
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,681
some extra shifts at Joe's...

575
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,292
You haven't worked at
the body shop for six months.

576
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,930
Fighting ruined everything, J,

577
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,565
don't you know that?

578
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:07,971
No. It didn't.

579
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,140
I did the right thing.

580
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,175
Not the right thing for you.

581
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,411
And what was that?
Letting my friend get beat up?

582
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,546
Oh, okay. All right then.

583
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,481
Where's Alvin now, Jaden?
Tell me that.

584
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,283
- Where is Alvin now?
- Alvin's alive, okay.

585
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,886
Alive,
and in an Ivy league school.

586
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:23,987
Where are you?

587
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,189
I'm a boxer now.
And I'm winning.

588
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,992
Yeah. Until you get
knocked into a coma?

589
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,327
You know, this time I mean it.
You're gonna...

590
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,996
You're gonna
stop this thing and...

591
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:35,064
You're gonna go back
to your normal job.

592
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,499
No. I said no!

593
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,402
I finally found something
I'm good at.

594
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,070
I'm good at this.

595
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,941
Can't you just be happy for me?

596
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,359
So how do you like the fridge?

597
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,197
It doesn't buzz.

598
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,706
Jaden...

599
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,476
Yeah?

600
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,881
I'm afraid of this.

601
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,553
I know.

602
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,560
This is what boxing needs.

603
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:13,696
Anderson was ranked
third by the WBC.

604
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,932
He was next in line
for a title shot.

605
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,202
Last night, this kid knocked
him out in the third round.

606
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,906
We are a basic cable network.
We haven't shown boxing

607
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:24,374
since the '60s.

608
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,809
But, that's what's
so interesting.

609
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,811
We all know, heavyweight boxing

610
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,413
hasn't done
big numbers in years.

611
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,315
And that's because
we haven't had a challenger

612
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:33,816
anyone cares about.

613
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,319
The crowd loves this kid.

614
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,755
He's poor, from the Bronx,

615
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,056
no high school diploma,

616
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,691
was working as an auto mechanic

617
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,560
when he and his mother
were evicted.

618
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,295
He quit his job to start boxing

619
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:46,829
and won back her apartment.

620
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,631
Hasn't lost yet.

621
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,634
And what? We give him
a shot at the title?

622
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,102
Yes.

623
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,905
I can see why the other
networks turned you down.

624
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,340
You're talking about a massacre.

625
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:58,641
People are tired of watching

626
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,143
three-round fights.

627
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,946
No, Mike...

628
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,715
People are just tired.

629
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,117
They need something
to believe in again.

630
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,154
So...

631
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,623
We make a show...

632
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,595
<i>The challenger.</i>

633
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,363
We show people his life.

634
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,298
Home, training, everything.

635
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,766
Follow him right up to
the fight.

636
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,002
Everyone's an underdog
right now.

637
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:27,937
America's an underdog.

638
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,840
We get America behind this kid

639
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,675
and this fight

640
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,377
could bring boxing back.

641
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,685
Thanks for coming.

642
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:45,355
Jaden, you know
I can't watch that.

643
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,492
So, how's this
new trainer of yours?

644
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,595
You just can't let it go,
can you?

645
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,766
It's just that, I've heard
some things about this guy...

646
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,534
Like people
heard things about me?

647
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,675
They want to spin it
as a public interest story.

648
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,777
Give a no-name a shot.

649
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:14,350
That's your idea of getting
me better fights, huh?

650
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,551
It's a pay day, James.

651
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:17,687
Besides, they're paying
double this time.

652
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:18,988
I don't fight for the money.

653
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,725
You're gonna tell me
Ramirez wasn't a pay check?

654
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:31,734
Come on.

655
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,304
That's him coming. I'm rolling.

656
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:36,739
- All right, here we go.
- Jaden Miller?

657
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,341
Jaden Miller. How does it feel?

658
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,043
Are you ready for
the opportunity of a lifetime?

659
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,177
Yeah, man. Are you nervous

660
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,245
- taking on Burchard?
- What's going on?

661
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:43,446
J, my office.

662
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:44,580
For one of your first big fights

663
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:45,682
of your career?

664
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,216
I mean, you've only had
like seven fights...

665
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,018
- Are you ready for this?
- What are they talking about?

666
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,087
Let's talk in my office.
Get back.

667
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:52,422
Hey, easy.
Don't touch the camera.

668
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:53,589
- Get back.
- What are they

669
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,691
- talking about, Duane?
- They offered you

670
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:55,758
a title shot.

671
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:56,959
What?

672
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:58,194
But it's got conditions.

673
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,395
They want to film your training.

674
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:01,864
Well, not just the training,
not just the training...

675
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,199
They want to film everything.
Your life.

676
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,767
They want to make it
into a show.

677
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,169
Why me?

678
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,472
Apparently Anderson was
next in line... if he'd won.

679
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,407
But look, J...

680
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:14,677
Anderson is one thing.
You got to think about this.

681
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,614
Oh. Easy, easy.
Don't touch the camera, man.

682
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:19,749
- Don't touch the camera.
- Move.

683
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:21,050
Uh, I need some time, all right?

684
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,785
Go. Go. Move!

685
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,054
Hey, man. That's
not part of your contract.

686
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,789
Get back here!
Hey, what are you doing?

687
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,111
- Get back here, baby!
- Get back!

688
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,931
Tell me you're not actually
considering this.

689
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,604
It's suicide, J. He'll kill you

690
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,005
out there. Literally.

691
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,408
Thanks.

692
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,610
He's put three opponents
in the hospital,

693
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:49,212
one in ICU.

694
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:50,646
You're talking about
the champion of the world.

695
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:51,781
So what, man?

696
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,151
What do you want me to do?
Run away?

697
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,723
Get this far and not finish?
Where's that gotten me?

698
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,024
Finish.

699
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,260
But finish
when you're ready, man.

700
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,336
Hey, ain't seen

701
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:21,971
that face in a while.

702
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:26,008
No lottery ticket, champ?

703
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,746
Hmm.

704
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,876
I can't do it.

705
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,247
What did you just say?

706
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:42,919
I can't do it.

707
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,688
Hmm.

708
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:48,891
Let me tell you
something, son...

709
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,130
There's a reason
why I found you.

710
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,168
There's a reason why
this fight found you.

711
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,405
Now, I know I've tried

712
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:03,940
to fight it...

713
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:12,682
But this is your path.

714
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:14,951
So take it.

715
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,286
Hmm?

716
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,291
Take it.

717
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,376
I'm gonna take the fight.

718
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:41,744
Oh, yes.

719
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,047
There's one thing
I need to know first, though.

720
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,482
Okay.

721
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:48,951
How do you know my mother?

722
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:56,826
She says she's heard things

723
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,893
about you.

724
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,396
Everybody's heard things, J.

725
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,699
She doesn't know anybody
in the boxing world.

726
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,636
- How old are you now?
- 24.

727
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,640
Well, about 23 years ago,
your mother and I...

728
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:14,510
We were in love.

729
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:17,880
What?

730
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,750
Even talked about
getting married.

731
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,086
She wanted a kid so bad.

732
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:27,590
When she found out
she couldn't have any, well...

733
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,494
I think that's why she worked
at that adoption agency

734
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:32,728
for so long.

735
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,367
One night I came home,
a little bit

736
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,435
later than normal.

737
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,905
She was holding a baby
in her arms...

738
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,809
A white baby.

739
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,312
She just said he was
left on the doorstep.

740
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,515
That it was a sign.

741
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,254
She believed in that stuff...

742
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,322
Although,
I might believe in it too.

743
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,690
So what'd you do?

744
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,329
What could I do? I panicked.

745
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,835
I was saving up to open
up my own gym.

746
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,037
Establish myself.

747
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,541
I was trying to do like you...

748
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,709
Be somebody.

749
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,849
I could hardly
take care of myself.

750
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:29,085
I couldn't take care of a kid.

751
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:34,290
Even if that kid needed you?

752
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:59,081
You got to give us something.

753
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,749
You got to give us something.

754
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,184
The camera's heavy.

755
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,652
Did you... tell me
about the neighborhood.

756
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:04,887
This looks like
a rough neighborhood.

757
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,622
You grew up around here?

758
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,157
Did you... did you go
to school around here?

759
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,492
So man,
what was it like growing up

760
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:10,960
in this neighborhood, man?

761
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:12,328
Hey, did you get in
a lot of fights

762
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,395
when you were at school?

763
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:14,763
Is that what kept happening?

764
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,599
Yeah, is that how you
learned how to fight?

765
00:52:17,068 --> 00:52:19,969
How long have you been, uh,
training with Duane?

766
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,038
- Come on...
- Come on, man...

767
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,473
Open up. I'm telling you.

768
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,175
- You're gonna wanna...
- You signed a contract

769
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,543
to do this, man. Come on.

770
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,378
So is this, uh,

771
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,880
how long
have you been living here?

772
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:32,381
I'm digging the, uh,
the vibe in here.

773
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,849
How long have you been
in this place, Jaden?

774
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,451
I told you, man.
I'm done with questions.

775
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:37,486
Ma! Ma? Are you all right?

776
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,188
What happened?
What's wrong with her?

777
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,289
Are you okay? What's the matter?

778
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,124
Call 911! Right now! Call 911!

779
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,026
Okay, yeah, yeah...

780
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:46,162
Get your phone!

781
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,429
Just put the Mike down!

782
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:49,064
Get out of here!

783
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,835
She's stable now.

784
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:55,504
I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

785
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,506
Has she been taking
her medication?

786
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,008
I give 'em to her every day.

787
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,442
She hates taking pills.

788
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:02,311
<i>I don't know if
it would've mattered.</i>

789
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:03,879
<i>Her heart is very weak.</i>

790
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,184
<i>I'd like to keep her
in the hospital.</i>

791
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:09,251
Get her strength back.

792
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:11,420
When she's ready,
we need to operate.

793
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:12,755
Operate?

794
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,024
I don't see another option.

Hey, what happened?
Where'd it go?

00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,139
Cops took it.
Said it was gambling.

806
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,845
- Let me have a pack of gum.
- All right.

807
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,294
How you feeling?

808
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,362
Better.

He didn't leave me, J.

812
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,279
What do you mean?

813
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,316
Well, maybe for a day.

814
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:23,018
But the very next day,
he was at my door.

815
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:26,155
With a dozen roses in one hand

816
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,657
and a ring I wanted
in the other.

817
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:32,695
He proposed...
Every day that week.

818
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,201
I left.

819
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:41,537
Why?

820
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,506
I wanted to be a mother,

821
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,344
more than anything.

822
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,914
And I couldn't take
a chance on someone

823
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,016
coming in and out of your life.

824
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,052
I chose you.

825
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,090
I chose you.

826
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,094
I love you, Jaden.

827
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,430
I love you too, ma.

828
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,088
- Hey.
- Hey.

829
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:37,126
She, uh...
She told me everything.

830
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,929
Sorry it took this long
for you to hear.

831
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,899
Me too.

832
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,938
Flowers and everything, huh?

833
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,608
She still didn't take you back?

834
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:55,244
She's a tough woman.

835
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,146
Yeah. That's the truth.

836
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,615
You know she needs surgery.

837
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,551
We can't afford it.

838
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,457
Your mother never gave me
a second chance, kid.

839
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:09,691
But you did.

840
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,394

841
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:14,496
the ratings of
that show of yours...

842
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,135
They want you to finish it, J.

843
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:25,274
The purse is big. 70-30 split.

844
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,075
If you win,
it'll be more than enough.

845
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,814
What if we lose?

846
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,583
We don't fight to lose.

the whole fight.

01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:23,652
Study his moves.
Learn his style.

894
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:24,720
Technique.

895
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,321
To the body, to the body!

896
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,323
Push him back,
push him back. Good. Good!

897
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,493
And then, gonna speed
the whole thing up.

898
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,161
Push him back on the ropes.

899
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:37,032
Easy. Easy. Easy, stop! Stop!

900
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,835
'Course, nobody
I put you against

901
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:42,337
is gonna be as strong,
or as quick,

902
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:43,972
or as fast as Burchard.

903
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,642
Take it easy.
I said the body. Easy! Stop!

904
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:47,976
Stop! Stop, James!

905
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,512
The hell is wrong with you?

906
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:51,713
'Cause in that ring,

907
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:53,915
you gotta be
a split second faster.

908
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,551
The hell's wrong with you.
You okay?

909
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,186
- You sure?
- Yeah.

910
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:00,355
Okay. James.

911
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,626
Every man is beatable,
gentlemen.

912
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,496
But to beat the man
you gotta learn

913
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,258
things about him.
You gotta do your homework.

914
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,533
<i>This is homework.</i>

915
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,568
<i>He's there for a reason.</i>

916
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,071
<i>He has worked it.</i>

917
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,675
<i>He has earned the right</i>

918
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,376
<i>to wear that championship belt.</i>

919
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,480
<i>So on those days you don't
feel like working too hard,</i>

920
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,150
remember, somebody's workin'.

921
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:29,217
That's him.

922
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,219
<i>When you don't feel like
hitting that bag</i>

923
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,288
<i>for three more minutes,
he feels like it.</i>

924
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,857
<i>He wants to be a champion.</i>

925
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,061
<i>You want what he has.</i>

926
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:41,263
<i>But he has worked
hard to get it.</i>

927
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,312
How hard are
you willing to work?

928
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,201
<i>Because I have seen him work.</i>

929
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,737
<i>And believe me,
you better be ready.</i>

930
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,305
<i>Because he's gonna be ready.</i>

931
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:52,808
<i>When I get on you,</i>

932
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:53,942
it's not because
I don't like you.

933
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:56,211
I want you to be ready
for that right there.

934
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,246
<i>'Cause that is a machine.</i>

935
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:01,283
<i>That is gonna come after you.</i>

936
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:04,920
<i>When that bell rings,
it's going to be eye to eye.</i>

937
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:08,090
<i>You lookin' at him.
Him lookin' at you.</i>

938
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:09,991
<i>And then you're
going to see everything</i>

939
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,426
<i>that I ever taught you.</i>

940
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,295
<i>Technique.</i>

941
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,764
<i>Endurance.</i>

942
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,132
<i>Strategy.</i>

943
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,135
You gotta do those things,
gentlemen, if you want to win.

944
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,209
That's Jaden Miller.

945
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:28,810
Hey, Bronx boy!
Go get him, buddy!

946
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,011
Jaden!

947
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,955
Bronx boy!

948
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:46,348
I was wrong, bro.

949
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,618
You're ready.

950
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,653
Definitely ready.

951
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:54,422
Oh, my god.

952
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:56,391
Whoo.

953
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:05,400
Come on, let's go.

954
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:07,569
Let's go get a milkshake.

955
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,971
Come on!

956
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:11,106
Ugh, god.

957
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,120
These were my father's.

958
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:28,290
Then mine. Now yours.

959
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:31,760
Duane, I...

960
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,628
He always wanted
to be in the ring

961
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,297
for a championship fight.

962
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:37,799
You think you can
wear 'em tomorrow?

963
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:38,900
Of course.

964
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:48,610
Thanks for giving me a chance.

965
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,545
Thank you for giving me
a second chance.

966
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,555
<i>For the first time</i>

967
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:01,723
<i>since the 1960s,</i>

968
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:05,860
<i>a boxing title fight is being
broadcast on basic cable.</i>

969
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,329
<i>That's right, America,
it's free.</i>

970
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:10,498
<i>Everyone will have the
opportunity to tune in tonight</i>

971
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,567
<i>for the fight of
the 21st century.</i>

972
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,536
<i>From his
meek beginnings in the Bronx,</i>

973
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:15,737
<i>to the heavyweight title</i>

974
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:17,706
<i>in just under a year.</i>

975
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,307
<i>And we've seen it all.</i>

976
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,942
<i>America has fallen in love</i>

977
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:22,577
<i>with the Bronx boy,
Jaden Miller,</i>

978
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,714
<i>and tonight he lives
the American dream.</i>

979
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:28,049
<i>Watch it here, 7:00 eastern.</i>

980
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:30,552
<i>Tonight, the Bronx boy
fights for it all</i>

981
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,520
<i>in New York's capital city.</i>

982
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,189
<i>I'm here in what has become</i>

983
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:36,324
<i>the poorest neighborhood
in the country.</i>

984
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,159
<i>This is the south Bronx.</i>

985
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,095
<i>And what Jaden Miller
calls home.</i>

986
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,498
<i>Here, it's more than
just a fight.</i>

987
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,101
For these folks,
Bronx boy Jaden Miller

988
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:47,569
<i>is fighting for them.</i>

989
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:49,738
Hi, Scotty.

990
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:51,339
Hey, Joe. How you doin'?

991
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,607
I'm good, how about yourself?

992
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:53,708
Not bad.

993
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,343
<i>The fight of the 21st century.</i>

994
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,845
- What are you havin'?
- I'll have a beer.

995
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,580
<i>Really serious about that title.</i>

996
01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:00,682
<i>That title of course
in reference to the...</i>

997
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:03,218
So, big night tonight
for the J, huh?

998
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,720
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be the big one.

999
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,289
I think he's gonna do real well.

1000
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:09,991
I hope so.

1001
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:13,728
Heavyweight boxing is back.

1002
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:15,764
<i>More fans are tuned in tonight</i>

1003
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,767
<i>than for any other fight
since Tyson-holyfield</i>

1004
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,935
<i>back in 1997.</i>

1005
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:23,438
And it's all due to one person.

1006
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,640
The challenger, Jaden Miller.

1007
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,079
Miller, they're ready for you.

1008
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,200
<i>Listen to that.</i>

1009
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,435
<i>It's clear who the favorite is
here tonight.</i>

1010
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,070
Jaden! Jaden!

1011
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:30,171
Come on, champ, let's go!

1012
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,008
And here comes
the challenger now.

1013
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:36,277
This is our fight.
This is what we've worked for.

1014
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,946
Let's do it!

1015
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,481
The crowd really showing

1016
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:41,349
its appreciation
for Bronx boy Jaden Miller.

1017
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:43,318
Well, I'm afraid it's all
just wishful thinking.

1018
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:45,587
Jaden Miller has a better chance

1019
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:46,888
at hitting the lottery

1020
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,389
than winning this fight
here tonight.

1021
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,705
This is where we wanna be!
This is where we wanna be!

1022
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:54,696
Let's go, Jaden! Get him, baby!

1023
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,231
Get him, babe! You can do it!

1024
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:00,835
We all know
what that sound means.

1025
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:04,672
<i>And here comes your champion,
James Burchard.</i>

1026
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:13,248
Get him outta here!

1027
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,520
This has got to be

1028
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:20,321
<i>the first fight that Burchard</i>

1029
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,056
is actually getting
less applause

1030
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:23,558
than his challenger.

1031
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,059
Besides
Mrs. Burchard, of course.

1032
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:26,761
Guess you owe that
to the pride of the Bronx.

1033
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:28,630
And that good ol'
American spirit.

1034
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,137
- What's that, the fight?
- Shut up!

1035
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:42,243
<i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i>

1036
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:47,182
<i>Our main event of the evening!</i>

1037
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:52,086
<i>Introducing first,</i>

1038
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:53,655
<i>the challenger!</i>

1039
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,056
<i>He comes to us tonight</i>

1040
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,457
<i>from the Bronx</i>

1041
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,526
<i>in New York City!</i>

1042
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:04,365
<i>Big welcome to the Bronx boy,</i>

1043
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,236
<i>Jaden Miller!</i>

1044
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:10,171
And how about Duane Taylor?

1045
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,105
This guy used to be one of the
best trainers in the business

1046
01:10:12,108 --> 01:10:13,975
until that fixed fight scandal.

1047
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:15,310
<i>No one's heard from him since.</i>

1048
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,978
<i>He gets
a second shot here tonight.</i>

1049
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,880
Come on, Jaden. Go, go, go!

1050
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:22,617
You can't say he didn't
put in the time and effort.

1051
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:26,454
<i>Fighting
out of the red corner...</i>

1052
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:31,259
<i>he weighs in at 175 pounds.</i>

1053
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:33,394
<i>No losses.</i>

1054
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:37,699
<i>29 wins by knockout.</i>

1055
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:41,603
<i>Mr. undefeatable,</i>

1056
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:45,206
<i>James Burchard!</i>

1057
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:47,442
<i>Burchard looks to be</i>

1058
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:49,477
<i>in the best shape of his career.</i>

1059
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:53,248
<i>Good evening, gentlemen.</i>

1060
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,349
<i>This is 12 rounds for the</i>

1061
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:56,284
<i>light heavyweight
world championship.</i>

1062
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,653
<i>Protect yourself at all times.</i>

1063
01:10:58,888 --> 01:10:59,954
<i>Touch gloves now.</i>

1064
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:01,697
<i>Come out fighting at the bell.</i>

1065
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,158
James Burchard simply

1066
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,427
towers over the challenger,
Jaden Miller.

1067
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,030
How is Miller
ever going to hit him,

1068
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:10,231
<i>if he can't even reach him?</i>

1069
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,000
<i>You hate to question
his motives, Peter,</i>

1070
01:11:12,002 --> 01:11:13,334
<i>but at some point,</i>

1071
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:14,469
doesn't it come down to ethics?

1072
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:15,603
Taking a title fight

1073
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,804
with such a novice fighter?

1074
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,039
You said it, Jason.

1075
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:20,541
I mean, he has no business
being in the ring tonight.

1076
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:22,110
And knowing Burchard's history,

1077
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:24,045
Jaden Miller is gonna get hurt.

1078
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:27,448
Boy, this is it.

1079
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,930
This is what
you've been training for.

1080
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:30,952
All that stuff
you went through as a kid,

1081
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,787
all those early morning
workouts,

1082
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,509
it's for this moment.
Right here, right now.

1083
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:38,026
And no matter
what happens out there,

1084
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:43,398
I want you to know, I'd be
proud to call you my son.

1085
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:50,505
Thanks.

1086
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,010
Go out there and get him.

1087
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:57,292
All right, come on, let's do it!

1088
01:11:58,148 --> 01:11:59,213
Look...

1089
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:01,049
I don't care what they say.

1090
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:02,517
We both know

1091
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,853
this is your biggest fight!

1092
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:09,824
He's never gone
more than three rounds.

1093
01:12:10,093 --> 01:12:11,292
You outlast him.

1094
01:12:12,262 --> 01:12:15,363
That's how we win. You hear me?

1095
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:17,999
- Yeah.
- Good.

1096
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,933
Box!

1097
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:16,958
<i>Miller
trying to get something going.</i>

1098
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:20,795
Come on.

1099
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,308
<i>Not much going
on here in the first round.</i>

1100
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,310
There's a...
A jab from Burchard.

1101
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,414
And another stiff left
by Burchard

1102
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,782
and Miller's shaken!

1103
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:42,950
Shaken in the first round

1104
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:46,020
as Burchard is landing
punch after punch on Miller!

1105
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:48,423
Peter, this is not the

1106
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,824
end of the round
that Miller wanted.

1107
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:51,626
Let's go! This is just
the beginning! Come on!

1108
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,696
He may be
out of his league here.

1109
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,399
Trying to stay in the round
with Burchard.

1110
01:13:58,401 --> 01:14:00,334
But backed into the corner.

1111
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,205
Burchard with total control
after round one.

1112
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:05,840
Jaden Miller lasted one round

1113
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,341
longer than I thought he would

1114
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,477
but I gotta tell you,
he didn't look half bad.

1115
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:10,912
Don't count him out
just yet, Peter.

1116
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:12,947
<i>His Bronx brethren
must be proud.</i>

1117
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,917
That's my man!
Go get him. Go get him!

1118
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:19,554
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

1119
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:20,822
There you go. Relax.

1120
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:21,923
Look here. Good. Good.

1121
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:24,992
Burchard has never
been knocked down.

1122
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:28,463
This round, knock him down.

1123
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:30,238
You hear what I'm telling you?
This round,

1124
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,732
he gets knocked down.

1125
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,702
Not later, not tomorrow,
right now, tonight.

1126
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:36,737
This guy gets knocked down!

1127
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:39,173
This round, by you!

1128
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:41,843
Because after today people
are going to call you champ.

1129
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,378
After today, you are the champ!

1130
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,948
- You understand me?
- Mmm-hmm.

1131
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,583
Okay, give me that. Come on.

1132
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:50,251
Relax, baby. You got this.

1133
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,652
Relax, but knock him down.

1134
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:05,366
<i>As the second round continues,</i>

1135
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:06,901
<i>Miller can't seem to get
anything going</i>

1136
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,002
once again.

1137
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:10,972
He's taking stiff left jabs
from Burchard.

1138
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:12,841
And now a right,

1139
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,802
a nice left-right combination
there from Burchard.

1140
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:17,845
<i>Miller... I can't believe he's
still standing at this point.</i>

1141
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:18,980
No, Peter, I can't believe

1142
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:21,282
he's still standing either.
He's got the face of a rhino,

1143
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:22,984
the fact that he hasn't
broken yet.

1144
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:25,419
Right now!

1145
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:28,289
<i>Wait a minute. Now it's.</i>

1146
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:29,690
<i>Miller getting in some shots!</i>

1147
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:30,892
<i>Actually, Miller is landing...</i>

1148
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:33,060
Come on give it to him!
Work that body!

1149
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,128
Punch after punch

1150
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,263
and the champ is feeling it!

1151
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:36,797
Hit him! Come on, hit him!

1152
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:40,701
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

1153
01:15:41,804 --> 01:15:43,704
And James Burchard goes down!

1154
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,573
James Burchard is down!

1155
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:48,809
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1156
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:51,445
I can't believe it! For the
first time in his career,

1157
01:15:51,447 --> 01:15:53,414
James Burchard is on the canvas!

1158
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,416
Boy, Scotty, look at that!

1159
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:56,617
Look at that shot!

1160
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,390
Yes, yes!

1161
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:04,792
Did you see that?
I know that kid!

1162
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:06,460
<i>I have never seen.</i>

1163
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:07,628
<i>James Burchard down.</i>

1164
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:10,565
He's not only down,
he's bleeding

1165
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:11,899
and he's hurt.

1166
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,100
And he's struggling to

1167
01:16:13,102 --> 01:16:14,302
get back to his feet.

1168
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:16,470
That's my boy! That's my boy!

1169
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,172
Come towards me.

1170
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:19,440
- Let's see your gloves.
- I'm good, I'm good!

1171
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:20,741
Box!

1172
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,916
And Burchard is furious!

1173
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,051
That has got to have

1174
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,152
shaken him up.

1175
01:16:31,154 --> 01:16:33,321
Time! Whoa, whoa! Break it up!

1176
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:34,622
What a round!

1177
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:36,490
Where did
Jaden Miller come from?

1178
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:38,693
That's easy.
And I hope they're watching,

1179
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:40,795
because Bronx boy Jaden Miller

1180
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:42,330
<i>is making history here tonight.</i>

1181
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:49,704
The champ of the Bronx

1182
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:51,606
versus the
champion of the world!

1183
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:52,873
Hold onto your seats, folks!

1184
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,275
We've got a fight on our hands!

1185
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:24,038
And now Miller is down!

1186
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:26,140
What a shot!

1187
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,309
Welcome to the big leagues,
Jaden Miller!

1188
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,377
And he looks hurt.

1189
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:31,479
Get up, get up.

1190
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:32,980
Get up! Get up!

1191
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,348
Get up! Get up!

1192
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,484
- Come on.
- Get up, J, not now!

1193
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:37,551
Come on. Get up!

1194
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:47,194
<i>Jaden...</i>

1195
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:51,032
Yeah?

1196
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:52,533
<i>If you don't stand up</i>

1197
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:54,502
<i>and fight for who you are now...</i>

1198
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,571
I'm afraid of this.

1199
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,007
Right now. You never will.

1200
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:02,443
I know.

1201
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,259
Get up. Get up!

1202
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:20,594
<i>Right now.</i>

1203
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:25,700
- Wait a minute.
- One,

1204
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:28,736
two, three,

1205
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:32,440
four, five, six...

1206
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:34,475
Jaden Miller is back up!

1207
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:36,711
There is no doubt about it!

1208
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,613
Nobody is getting out of this
fight easy here tonight.

1209
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:40,748
Whoo!

1210
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:44,585
Jaden! Jaden! Jaden!

1211
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:46,554
Let's see your gloves.

1212
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:00,634
Time!

1213
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:05,272
That's my son.

1214
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:09,944
He's out there fighting for me.

1215
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,317
As round 4 begins, Jason,

1216
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,086
this is uncharted territory
for the challenger.

1217
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,722
The question is,
how long can he survive?

1218
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:23,791
How you feelin'?

1219
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,459
I can't feel my arms.

1220
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,328
That's all right. Believe me,

1221
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,829
he's hurtin' just as bad.

1222
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:30,464
Okay, do me one favor.

1223
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,666
- Yeah.
- Forget the training,

1224
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:33,768
forget the pain...

1225
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:38,005
Just dance. Remember that?

1226
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,307
Remember the man with no arms?

1227
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:42,009
The hips, the hips, baby.

1228
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:43,644
That's all we gotta do
in this fight.

1229
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:45,813
Forget everything else.
Dance on him.

1230
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:49,016
Come on, you got this.
You got this, come on!

1231
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:50,785
This is our fight, come on!
This is what we worked for.

1232
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:51,852
Let's do it!

1233
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:54,976
<i>The crowd is electrified, Jason.</i>

1234
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:57,691
We've gotta be
the only two people

1235
01:19:57,693 --> 01:19:59,560
sitting down
watching this fight.

1236
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:04,465
Round 4 may have done it.

1237
01:20:05,735 --> 01:20:06,801
That's a knock-down!

1238
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,304
Shake that off! Shake that off!

1239
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:20,548
Six, seven, eight,

1240
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,649
box!

1241
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,396
That's it! That's it!

1242
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,443
Move! Move!

1243
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,946
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1244
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:09,697
Come on, baby, come on!

1245
01:21:13,135 --> 01:21:15,069
There you go,
almost time, almost time!

1246
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:20,774
Beautiful.
There you go baby, beautiful!

1247
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:00,014
Come on, get up!

1248
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:01,749
Peter,
Burchard takes that round,

1249
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:04,818
but the champ has never
seen a challenger like this.

1250
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,254
Work the body, work the body!

1251
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,323
Burchard with
another powerful right,

1252
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:10,758
but Miller answers again.

1253
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,593
That's it, that's it!

1254
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,595
Knock his ass out! Yeah!

1255
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:15,696
One,

1256
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:16,797
- two...
- I'm okay.

1257
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:19,967
Three, four, five...

1258
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,103
Here we go! Here we go!

1259
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:27,041
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Eight. Come towards me.

1260
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:28,842
Let me see your gloves.

1261
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,054
What the hell's
going on out there?

1262
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,472
Anyone who is scoring this fight

1263
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,507
has gotta give that round
to the challenger.

1264
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:01,675
Endurance.

1265
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,077
Endurance, right?

1266
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:05,245
Speed kills, baby. Speed kills.

1267
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:08,215
I don't know what to do.

1268
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,350
I don't know what to do.

1269
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:10,584
Keep your arms up.
Watch the body.

1270
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:11,685
Watch the body.

1271
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:13,887
- Just like we practiced.
- Okay.

1272
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:15,169
- Just like we practiced.
- Yeah.

1273
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:19,693
Let's do it!

1274
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:29,837
Keep movin' there.
Keep movin', endurance!

1275
01:23:44,787 --> 01:23:47,521
Both fighters
are simply exhausted.

1276
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,223
Burchard with another weak jab.

1277
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:51,125
He can barely
keep his hands up, Jason.

1278
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:54,061
Miller comes back with
another shot to the body

1279
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:56,697
as he continues to pound
the champ's midsection.

1280
01:24:00,038 --> 01:24:02,903
Burchard
now in excruciating pain!

1281
01:24:07,177 --> 01:24:08,377
One-two, one-two.

1282
01:24:09,018 --> 01:24:10,412
This could be it, folks!

1283
01:24:12,087 --> 01:24:13,915
And Burchard
is saved by the bell!

1284
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:15,814
Unbelievable!

1285
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:17,114
Listen to this crowd!

1286
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:20,327
What was anticipated to be
a one-round fight

1287
01:24:20,326 --> 01:24:23,092
has now turned
into an all-out war,

1288
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,792
with James Burchard

1289
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:27,428
literally in jeopardy
of losing his title!

1290
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:30,464
All right,
everyone take a ticket!

1291
01:24:30,466 --> 01:24:32,466
For good luck because
it's the last round.

1292
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:33,600
Everyone take a ticket!

1293
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:35,469
Spit it out.

1294
01:24:39,008 --> 01:24:40,074
Let me take a look.

1295
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:44,138
- They're broken.
- You think?

1296
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:46,313
- Can you breathe?
- -Yeah.

1297
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,681
- I'm good.
- James,

1298
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:48,782
if they broke...

1299
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:50,417
- No, no...
- Look, I can't let you...

1300
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,252
I said no, okay!

1301
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,921
You're not stopping this fight!

1302
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:56,623
Okay, kid...

1303
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:00,360
Keep 'em covered.

1304
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,363
- You hear me?
- I got this.

1305
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:04,598
Keep 'em covered.

1306
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:07,701
Jason,
how do you score the fight?

1307
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,002
Every round has been close,

1308
01:25:09,004 --> 01:25:11,705
but I've got it 7 to 4,
James Burchard.

1309
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:14,775
But I've gotta tell you,
what a job by Jaden Miller!

1310
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,277
Going the distance!
Nobody saw this coming.

1311
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,679
If he has anything
left to prove,

1312
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:19,813
it's to himself.

1313
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:21,548
This is it! I got nothin' left.

1314
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:22,850
I know. I know.

1315
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:25,052
And in 10 minutes,

1316
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:26,954
this'll all be over.
You can rest.

1317
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,388
You can go back to your mom

1318
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,124
and you can tell everybody

1319
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:32,860
about how you made it to
the last round with the champ.

1320
01:25:32,862 --> 01:25:34,394
Nobody can take that
from you now.

1321
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,232
But if you can just find it
within yourself,

1322
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:40,501
to give me three more minutes...

1323
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:42,069
180 seconds...

1324
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:44,972
One day, you'll tell your kids,

1325
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:46,874
when you were up
against the ropes,

1326
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:49,309
when you were down
and had nothin' left,

1327
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,410
that you stood up

1328
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,513
and you fought for who you are!

1329
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:54,882
When I first met you,

1330
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:55,983
they didn't even know your name.

1331
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,084
Now listen to 'em!

1332
01:25:57,253 --> 01:26:00,254
Jaden! Jaden! Jaden!

1333
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:02,890
Where we're from, we gotta
fight for what we get.

1334
01:26:02,892 --> 01:26:04,024
Seconds out!

1335
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:06,093
Okay, okay, okay.
There's just 10 seconds left.

1336
01:26:06,095 --> 01:26:07,261
Look, listen to me.

1337
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,930
Go for his ribs.
They're hurting.

1338
01:26:09,932 --> 01:26:12,032
You can do this, J.
I know you can.

1339
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,537
Let's show 'em
where you're from, j!

1340
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:19,873
Show 'em
where you're from, baby!

1341
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:44,364
<i>Burchard with
a left hook, and another.</i>

1342
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,366
<i>Miller counters with a jab...</i>

1343
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,902
<i>Burchard with a powerful right.</i>

1344
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:51,605
<i>Miller now with another shot
to the body.</i>

1345
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:54,808
Burchard is taking a beating
here in the final round!

1346
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,743
Miller just
attacking those ribs!

1347
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:58,445
Working so hard
for the knockdown!

1348
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:05,886
Finish him! Finish him now!

1349
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:07,888
Pounding away at the body

1350
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,256
with everything he's got left.

1351
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:11,758
Jason, I can't believe
both of these guys

1352
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,760
are still standing
at this point.

1353
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:15,963
And now it's Miller
who's in the corner!

1354
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:21,068
Come on! Don't give up!

1355
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:31,178
Body! Body!

1356
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:37,451
Hips!

1357
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:20,327
Two...

1358
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:23,797
four...

1359
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:27,701
seven... it's over!

1360
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:28,802
You've taken enough
punishment, champ.

1361
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,337
I can't believe it!

1362
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:32,739
Jaden Miller
has done the unthinkable!

1363
01:28:33,242 --> 01:28:34,708
<i>Miller, the new</i>

1364
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,311
<i>light heavyweight
champion of the world!</i>

1365
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:38,912
<i>How about that!</i>

1366
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:30,731
Oh...

1367
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:33,700
And you lost.

1368
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:38,105
Never did win these things.

1369
01:29:45,981 --> 01:29:47,047
You ready?

1370
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:48,281
Yup.

1371
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:07,934
We did it, pop.

1372
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,260
Always the last one.

1373
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:39,699
You know, I never asked you
how those sneakers feel.

1374
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:41,134
They're a little tight actually.

1375
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:42,202
Oh, really?

1376
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:44,137
Well, get your own next time.

1377
01:30:49,578 --> 01:30:50,644
Here you go, ma.

1378
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:40,093
We don't train to lose.

1379
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:45,432
I'd just like to say
it's been a pleasure

1380
01:31:45,434 --> 01:31:46,933
working on<i> the challenger.</i>

1381
01:31:47,536 --> 01:31:48,668
This has been one of the most

1382
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,871
innovative movies
I have ever done

1383
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:53,006
and I told this guy right here,

1384
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:54,774
when I first met him
at the airport...

1385
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:56,443
I said there's only
two director-actors

1386
01:31:56,445 --> 01:31:58,278
that I've ever worked with...

1387
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,347
Anthony Hopkins and him.

1388
01:32:00,349 --> 01:32:02,249
He's in a really good category.

1389
01:32:02,551 --> 01:32:05,785
From this guy right here...
From this guy right here.

1390
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:07,888
This is our man.
He's the sound guy.

1391
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,089
And all these guys standing

1392
01:32:09,091 --> 01:32:10,524
over here, all you guys,
come here.

1393
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:12,359
Come here. I want everybody
over here, come here.

1394
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:13,760
I want everybody to see this.

1395
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:18,732
All these guys made
<i>the challenger...</i>

1396
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:20,700
And are gonna make
<i>the challenger</i> a great movie.

1397
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:21,868
Everybody.

1398
01:32:22,337 --> 01:32:23,937
And from me,
Michael Clarke Duncan,

1399
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:25,472
I wanna say thank you

1400
01:32:25,474 --> 01:32:27,073
to the cast and crew

1401
01:32:27,075 --> 01:32:29,409
for really making this
a unique experience.

1402
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:31,578
I didn't know what to expect
when I got down here.

1403
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,079
I was truly flabbergasted

1404
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:35,382
that these guys
are doing a hell of a job.

1405
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:37,150
From me to everybody
in Hollywood,

1406
01:32:37,152 --> 01:32:38,985
watch out for<i> the challenger.</i>
Thank you guys.

1407
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:41,221
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you so much.

1408
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,557
Man, that was awesome,
seriously.
