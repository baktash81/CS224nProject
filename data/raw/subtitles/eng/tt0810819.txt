1
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,719
Don't you wish you could paint like that?

2
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,880
Oh, I'm sorry?

3
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,014
I said, don't you wish
you could paint like your husband?

4
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:47,184
Really. You must be so proud of him.

5
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:52,353
So elegant.

6
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:55,056
Yes, they're all Vejle,
where he grew up.

7
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:58,857
Now, I don't say my client is the
best landscape artist in Denmark,

8
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,152
but he is in the top one.

9
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,658
Yes. Oh, hello!

10
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,531
It's going very well.

11
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,794
Mmm. Yes. He'll be impossible.

12
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,161
Oh, my.

13
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,094
Oh, thank you.

14
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,221
And Rasmussen!

15
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:23,048
Oh, come on. Be kind.
At least he agreed to see your work.

16
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,455
It was only because he was drunk.

17
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,511
I know.

18
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:26,595
Yes, you were loving it.

19
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,010
I was not!

20
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,852
"I don't say my client is
the best landscape artist in Denmark..."

21
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:32,935
But...

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,940
"He's in the top one!"

23
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:37,192
Quiet! People are sleeping.

24
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,154
Sorry.

25
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:00,571
Do you know what time it is?

26
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,514
Time you came back to bed?

27
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,801
No.

28
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,137
I'm ready to start work.

29
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,644
- Gerda.
- What?

30
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,231
Your face.

31
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:19,823
You think I can't resist you?

32
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,489
Do you want to resist me?

33
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:25,608
No.

34
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:29,241
But I'd like you to ask nicely,
so I don't feel such a pushover.

35
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,875
Gerda Wegener.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My life.

37
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,507
My wife.

38
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,850
Thorbjorn.

39
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:57,024
Mr. Wegener.

40
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:04,985
Tighter.

41
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:17,998
Perfect.

42
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,665
Yes. More.

43
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:35,225
Einar Wegener.

44
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:37,516
Oh, don't worry about him.

45
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,559
He's only ever had eyes for one woman.

46
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,727
My guilty secret's out.

47
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:44,899
So,

48
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:48,486
when are you two
going to brood me a godchild, huh?

49
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:49,912
Ulla, you're an atheist.

50
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:51,701
Have you tried drinking raw eggs?

51
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,082
- No.
- Do it. For my sake.

52
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,579
- We're trying.
- Try harder.

53
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,123
Anyway...

54
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:00,288
What are you doing in today?

55
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,094
I thought you had finished last week.

56
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:06,013
I wanted to check on the painting
of the backdrop for the storm scene.

57
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,760
And give Gerda some space.

58
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:11,641
Ah. She's got a shy one?

59
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,509
Well, you know I'm next.

60
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,098
Oh... So I heard.

61
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,525
I won't be shy.

62
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,024
I should imagine not.

63
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,978
She'll need all her colors for me.

64
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,121
Mmm-hmm.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mmm!

66
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:45,342
Head up.

67
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,553
I wanted to say
I appreciate our being alone today.

68
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,641
I hope your husband doesn't mind.

69
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,232
Not at all.

70
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:05,401
I could see his being here
made you uncomfortable.

71
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,651
It wasn't personal.

72
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:11,735
It's not uncommon.

73
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,489
Ah.

74
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:17,118
It's hard for a man
to be looked at by a woman.

75
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:21,211
Women are used to it,
of course, but for a man to, um,

76
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:24,963
submit to a woman's gaze.

77
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,167
It's unsettling.

78
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:35,805
Although I believe there's some pleasure
to be had from it, once you, um,

79
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:39,848
yield.

80
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,310
Sit.

81
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,150
Good girl.

82
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,962
- Morning.
- Morning.

83
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:22,892
Well?

84
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,310
Perfect.

85
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,435
Almost.

86
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,820
Ah.

87
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,583
Good luck!

88
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,497
Toodle-oo!

89
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,780
All portraits.

90
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,450
Is that bad?

91
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,373
Not per se.

92
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,720
This kind of work is not really my...

93
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,932
Gerda, I don't think it would
benefit either of us to show these.

94
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,939
It's not a judgment on your abilities.

95
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,190
I agree with Einar.

96
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:53,822
You could be a first-class painter
if you found the right subject matter.

97
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,246
How was it?

98
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,789
Fine.

99
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,415
I finally managed
to get the color for the snow.

100
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:15,342
A bog in Vejle.

101
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,385
I don't know how you can
paint the same thing over and over.

102
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,840
I suppose I just haven't
finished with it yet.

103
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,970
Gerda?

104
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,176
Could you please not speak
to Rasmussen about me again?

105
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,895
My work is my business.

106
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,731
- Stay out of it.
- Gerda.

107
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,471
I have my period.

108
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,353
Sorry.

109
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,057
- Are you?
- Of course I am.

110
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:09,643
I mean, you know I am.

111
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,053
Could you help me with something?

112
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:22,278
Anything.

113
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:25,124
Ulla has an extra rehearsal.
She canceled again.

114
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,330
Oh.

115
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,411
Would you try on her stockings and shoes?

116
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:32,923
I'm just so behind, I don't know how
I'll be finished in time for her opening.

117
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,288
Yeah, I'll...

118
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:35,536
I'll do it.

119
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:37,918
It's fine, I'll do it.

120
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,085
They're there.

121
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,920
Hvappe, no, not now.

122
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:17,922
He almost snagged it.

123
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,882
Hvappe.

124
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Uh...

125
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:25,975
That's backwards.

126
00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:38,438
I saw those in the window at Fonnesbech's.

127
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,523
Hmm.

128
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:41,897
Smart, aren't they?

129
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,492
I don't think they'll fit.

130
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:45,739
Well, you do the best you can.

131
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,257
- No, I need the dress.
- No.

132
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:10,846
I need to see how the hem falls.

133
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:12,024
No, Gerda, I'm not putting it on.

134
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,182
Well, I haven't asked you to.

135
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,356
Just relax.

136
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:24,318
The sooner I start,

137
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,449
the sooner I finish.

138
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,253
Well, hello, there!

139
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,592
Oh, don't worry, my darling.

140
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:31,593
We're going to call you

141
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,347
Lili.

142
00:13:57,454 --> 00:13:59,164
Such concentration.

143
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,248
Sometimes I think you're going to slip

144
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,803
through the surface
of the painting and vanish.

145
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,297
Into the bog.

146
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,971
Like your friend's kite
when you were a boy.

147
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,473
- Hans.
- Mmm.

148
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,014
Yes, Hans.

149
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,980
I bet he still sits on that rock,

150
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,193
sobbing his heart out.

151
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,362
Don't.

152
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:29,647
He's actually an art dealer in Paris.

153
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:33,355
- Peddling old masters to rich Americans.
- Hmm.

154
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,198
So we don't need to worry about Hans.

155
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,405
No, we don't need to worry about Hans.

156
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,255
I didn't mean to disturb you.

157
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,461
No, it's okay. I'm finished.

158
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,960
And don't worry, I won't
disappear into the bog.

159
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,713
The bog's in me, silly.

160
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
What?

161
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:13,364
Can't a man watch his wife get undressed?

162
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:20,659
It's new.

163
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:23,246
That's very observant.

164
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,338
Oh, no, leave it on.

165
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,520
It's pretty.

166
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,475
I might let you borrow it.

167
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,568
I might enjoy that.

168
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,071
Is there something you'd like to tell me?

169
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:56,533
Is there something you'd like to know?

170
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,783
No.

171
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,697
I'm your wife.

172
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,911
I know everything.

173
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:14,089
Those two, over there.

174
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,090
Both of them?

175
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,427
And at the same time.

176
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:22,806
Oh, married people
are so delightfully easy to shock.

177
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,733
We just pretend to be shocked
because it encourages you.

178
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,646
I know.

179
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,769
That is why you're the only married couple
in my party for the Artists' Ball.

180
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,397
No. Out of the question.

181
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,779
She can go without me.

182
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:37,659
Gerda without an escort?
Why, it would be a scandal!

183
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,281
Gerda loves a scandal.

184
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,783
Look at the way she dresses.

185
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,868
Flaunting her ankles.

186
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:46,003
I don't think anyone is likely to
be corrupted by seeing my ankles.

187
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,503
I was.

188
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,295
It was the first time we met,
I was leaving the Academy

189
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:53,249
and she was sitting on the steps,
flaunting said ankles.

190
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:57,428
And she propositioned me.

191
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,216
Is that true?

192
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,804
When I said hello to him,
he actually blushed.

193
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,600
He was so shy, so I asked him out.

194
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:07,977
And you said yes.

195
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:09,436
Well, she made me.

196
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,067
She seemed so sure.

197
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,522
I was sure.

198
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:15,988
I still am.

199
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:18,113
- Please, enough.
- No.

200
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:20,574
What was it about him?

201
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,157
I don't know.

202
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,750
But we went for coffee, and after,

203
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:28,998
I kissed him.

204
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:32,794
And it was the strangest thing.

205
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,925
It was like kissing myself.

206
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:38,425
These two won't be staying much longer.

207
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,049
Unmarried people
are so delightfully easy to shock.

208
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:01,702
Leave it.

209
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:09,251
Were you really corrupted by my ankles?

210
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,043
You were shameless.

211
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:18,876
I still am.

212
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,539
Beautiful,

213
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:39,755
shameless Gerda.

214
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,570
Wait.

215
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:38,021
Did I wake you?

216
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,613
Sorry.

217
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,284
I couldn't sleep.

218
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,278
Why?

219
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:48,165
Wondering about things.

220
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,619
What things?

221
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:54,198
Wondering if we made a baby last night.

222
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,122
What do you think?

223
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,213
Wondering when you got so pretty.

224
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:04,212
I was always pretty.

225
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,217
But you just never noticed.

226
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,550
- Hello?
- In here.

227
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:55,467
These are good, Gerda.

228
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,480
- You think?
- Mmm.

229
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,230
Well, thank you.

230
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,275
I had a coffee with Ulla.

231
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,688
- Hmm.
- She asked me about the Artists' Ball.

232
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,284
I'm not going.

233
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,162
Don't worry.

234
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,410
I told her no.

235
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,289
You should go. You enjoy it.

236
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,120
With you, I enjoy it.

237
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:21,545
It's good to be seen at those things.

238
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,795
I do understand that.

239
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,094
And that's why you hate them.

240
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,457
I feel as though I'm performing myself.

241
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:29,967
Giving them your Einar Wegener.

242
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,050
Mmm-hmm.

243
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:38,056
Why not give them something different?

244
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,520
Go as someone else?

245
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,729
Do you have someone in particular in mind?

246
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:51,494
No.

247
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,531
You'd be very convincing.

248
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,660
That is outrageous.

249
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,536
Oh, you might even enjoy it.

250
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,623
No.

251
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:14,338
You'll have to shave closer next time.

252
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:26,359
Mmm? Mmm.

253
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,279
Close your eyes.

254
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:32,204
This is hard on someone else.

255
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:33,277
Well, let me try.

256
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,870
What do you think?

257
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,503
Better than I ever manage.

258
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:50,461
Lili.

259
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,173
I want to sketch you.

260
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,089
Sit.

261
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,220
Come on, Hvap. Come on, you.

262
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,643
Lean to the side.

263
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:02,183
Knee over.

264
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:05,981
Head up. Oh.

265
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,443
Look at those hands. Relax.

266
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:26,707
Don't make her a slut!

267
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,080
It's your fault.

268
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:31,211
You excite her.

269
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,424
My, Miss Lili.

270
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:35,217
You are forward.

271
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:36,758
You have no idea.

272
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,650
Maybe bring out the hand.

273
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:57,453
Morning.

274
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:06,288
Morning, Thorbjorn.

275
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:07,618
Good morning.

276
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:20,552
Forward.

277
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,850
Hello?

278
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:11,058
I was wondering where you were.

279
00:26:12,898 --> 00:26:14,358
It's getting late.

280
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,857
We have plenty of time.

281
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,114
I bought you these.

282
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,237
Ah.

283
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:25,544
Oh, they're perfect.

284
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,579
Are you sure about tonight?

285
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:49,061
What is it?

286
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:52,399
Am I pretty enough?

287
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:55,225
Of course you are.

288
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,364
I'll never be as pretty as you.

289
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:03,737
You are so beautiful.

290
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,219
My darling!

291
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:24,094
Ulla, let me introduce...

292
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,182
It's Lili.

293
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,142
That's right.

294
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:32,348
Einar's cousin from Vejle.

295
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,939
My dear.

296
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:35,771
You're exquisite!

297
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,276
In, let's go in.

298
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,493
Come on.

299
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:44,406
You won't leave me, will you?

300
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:48,118
No, never.

301
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:03,512
People are looking.

302
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,803
Well, you're a pretty girl.

303
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:09,644
You'll have to get used to it.

304
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,437
It's fine.

305
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:21,233
You're just feeling self-conscious.

306
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,741
Gerda?

307
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:23,954
Oh...

308
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:27,202
Go and talk to them.

309
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:28,735
I'll stay with you.

310
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:32,039
No, go, I'll be fine.
Please go before they come over.

311
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:33,622
All right.

312
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,500
Who's that?

313
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:33,221
Are you a reporter?

314
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:37,191
No.

315
00:29:38,061 --> 00:29:39,441
A poetess?

316
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:00,829
Do you know the story of this oak tree?

317
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:04,086
No.

318
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:09,342
They say that if you eat its acorns,
you can make a wish.

319
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:12,513
And become anyone you want for a day.

320
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:17,934
Why would they say that?

321
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:23,398
Henrik Sandahl.

322
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,020
At your disposal.

323
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:26,689
Lili.

324
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:31,066
Are you here with someone, Lili?

325
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:34,239
Yes, my, uh...

326
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:35,704
My cousin's wife.

327
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,041
Who's your cousin?

328
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:42,875
Einar Wegener. Painter.

329
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,090
Yes, he's rather a good one.

330
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:49,724
He's better than most people think.

331
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:51,967
Is that right?

332
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,217
Most people our age, at any rate.

333
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,310
Don't go back in there.
It's, um... It's cooler out here.

334
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:07,941
Besides, I'm a romantic.

335
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:09,358
Really?

336
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:11,574
I prefer the shadows.

337
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:15,492
And I don't mean to presume,

338
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:17,334
but I've been watching you.

339
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:21,083
And I think you might be the same.

340
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,919
Come on.

341
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,940
Have you seen Einar? I can't find him.

342
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:44,522
Of course you can't. He isn't here.

343
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:49,194
Cheers.

344
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:54,278
You're different from most girls.

345
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,204
That's not a very original line.

346
00:32:00,537 --> 00:32:01,577
It's true.

347
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,131
You're old-fashioned.

348
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:07,626
Provincial.

349
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:11,667
I'm new to the city.

350
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,553
No, it's more than that.

351
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:19,099
I feel I'd need to ask your permission
before I kissed you.

352
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,266
I should go and find Gerda.

353
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:33,401
Why don't you tell her I'll walk you home?

354
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:37,244
No, she wouldn't like that.

355
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,486
- Lili...
- No, Einar...

356
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:44,748
He might be waiting for us,
and he wouldn't like this.

357
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:46,924
Wouldn't he?

358
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:49,592
No.

359
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:54,593
Lili...

360
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,300
Lili...

361
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:04,643
Lili...

362
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:28,504
You didn't ask permission.

363
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,003
I couldn't risk you saying no.

364
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,467
What's the matter?

365
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,970
I'm sorry.

366
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,709
I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.

367
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,389
How are you?

368
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:33,961
You were late home last night,
so I thought I'd let you sleep.

369
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,358
How was it?

370
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:40,614
Did Lili have fun?

371
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:02,085
I think it would be better
if Lili didn't come here again.

372
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:06,969
Fine.

373
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:10,314
Exactly what happened
between you and Sandahl last night?

374
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:13,234
Nothing. It was nothing.

375
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:15,061
Did he know it was you?

376
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,439
It wasn't as simple as that.

377
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:20,896
I watched him kiss you, Einar,
so could you please make an effort?

378
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:27,744
He may have known who I was,
but I wasn't always me.

379
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:33,578
There was a moment when I was just Lili,
and I think that he could see that.

380
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:37,338
- Do you see?
- But Lili doesn't exist.

381
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:43,086
- We made her up.
- I know.

382
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,140
- We were playing a game.
- I know we were.

383
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:48,772
But then,

384
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,185
something changed.

385
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,110
This is absurd. We... We need to stop.

386
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:58,983
You need to stop, Einar.

387
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,780
I am going to try.

388
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:29,475
Another headache?

389
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:32,599
It's nothing.

390
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,060
Can I get you anything?

391
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,280
I'm fine.

392
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:53,867
Maybe you should see a doctor.

393
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:54,955
Gerda...

394
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:56,924
I'm fine.

395
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:13,492
I didn't think you'd come.

396
00:40:16,658 --> 00:40:17,868
No.

397
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:20,452
Nor did I.

398
00:40:36,595 --> 00:40:38,605
I thought you might not come back.

399
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,470
That's absurd.

400
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,184
Is it?

401
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,318
Come here.

402
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:20,926
The model...

403
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:25,482
Einar's cousin.

404
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:33,575
The resemblance is...

405
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:41,165
Are there others?

406
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,450
A series back at the studio.

407
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:48,121
These are different.

408
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:51,294
For these...

409
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,128
I don't know, there may be a market.

410
00:41:53,797 --> 00:41:55,127
You're taking them?

411
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:56,545
Well, yes.

412
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:12,772
Come in.

413
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:20,818
I haven't got long.

414
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:23,738
Gerda's seeing Rasmussen.

415
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:27,999
I don't like all these lies.

416
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,502
She's very protective.

417
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:33,668
Why don't you just tell her about us?

418
00:42:33,837 --> 00:42:35,457
I couldn't do that.

419
00:42:44,473 --> 00:42:45,683
Sorry.

420
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,350
I don't want to upset you.

421
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:55,284
Come here.

422
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:05,076
- No.
- Yes.

423
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:12,917
Einar.

424
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
What?

425
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:19,417
Come on. Shh. It's all right.

426
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:24,176
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

427
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:29,385
I... Lili.

428
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:30,559
Please.

429
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:33,984
I don't know what you want.

430
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,775
- I want you.
- I don't know what you mean.

431
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,359
- I want you.
- No!

432
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:43,988
Lili. Lili. Lili, wait!

433
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:49,097
Are you all right?

434
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:52,475
No.

435
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:04,453
I've been seeing Henrik Sandahl.

436
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:19,708
I'm...

437
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:48,665
I thought perhaps you knew.

438
00:45:48,698 --> 00:45:50,118
No.

439
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:52,042
Not this.

440
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:55,371
So...

441
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,576
Are you in love with Sandahl?

442
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:01,707
No.

443
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,800
No, I love you.

444
00:46:06,216 --> 00:46:09,506
Gerda, only you. It's Lili, she...

445
00:46:10,345 --> 00:46:11,345
Be honest.

446
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:15,353
I need you to believe me, Gerda.
You of all people to understand.

447
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:19,057
All right.
You need to tell me when Henrik and

448
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:20,479
Lili

449
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:22,734
are together, they what? They...

450
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:25,032
They kiss?

451
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:30,068
- Has it gone beyond that?
- No.

452
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:34,082
No, Lili has never gone
further than that with a man.

453
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,251
She wouldn't. She's...

454
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:36,912
There have been other men?

455
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,369
Wait, there...

456
00:46:38,415 --> 00:46:42,215
There was another, yes,
but it was a long time ago.

457
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:46,417
It was that boy, Hans.

458
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,720
In Vejle.

459
00:46:48,884 --> 00:46:51,394
She fell for him, and

460
00:46:52,554 --> 00:46:54,764
he kissed her. Just once.

461
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,350
But then my father came in
and he caught them.

462
00:47:01,605 --> 00:47:03,905
And he smacked Hans down.

463
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,400
He was so angry.

464
00:47:08,236 --> 00:47:09,736
I don't know what to say.

465
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:16,325
What?

466
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:19,164
I'm so...

467
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:20,617
Einar?

468
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:22,041
I'm so sorry.

469
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:25,298
- I'm so sorry, I'm not feeling well.
- Einar, what is it?

470
00:47:25,462 --> 00:47:26,922
Einar, Einar, Einar!

471
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:30,219
Einar. What's happened? What's happening?

472
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,890
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
- What? Do you have pain?

473
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:57,122
So, you saw Dr. Andersen
after a bout of severe nosebleeds,

474
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,120
which you have come to believe

475
00:48:00,288 --> 00:48:05,458
coincide with the stomach cramps,
and on a monthly basis.

476
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:06,919
Hmm.

477
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:09,171
So.

478
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,080
How long have you been married?

479
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:12,973
Six years.

480
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:14,179
Children?

481
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,261
No.

482
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:17,642
Is there regular copulation?

483
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:20,641
Yes.

484
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,310
Perhaps less now than before...

485
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,200
Than before you started
to dress as a woman?

486
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:31,493
I'm a specialist, Mr. Wegener.
You may be embarrassed.

487
00:48:31,528 --> 00:48:33,028
I am not.

488
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:36,073
Tell me about Lili.

489
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:38,032
Where does she come from?

490
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:40,199
Inside me.

491
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:49,340
You know, the most likely explanation
for all of this is a chemical imbalance.

492
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:51,383
- Really?
- Mmm.

493
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,380
Onto the bed.

494
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:56,724
That would explain the pain,

495
00:48:56,803 --> 00:49:00,853
the confused state of masculinity
and the infertility.

496
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,351
Let's hope it is that,
because that, at least, we can cure.

497
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:09,575
I don't need to do this.

498
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:11,113
There's nothing wrong with me.

499
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:13,193
- That's not true.
- Gerda, this can't be right.

500
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:15,911
Radiation is a miracle, Mr. Wegener.

501
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:19,083
It destroys the bad and saves the good.

502
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:21,657
I'm sure it'll be over quickly.

503
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,680
Lie still, Mr. Wegener.

504
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:05,956
Mr. Wegener?

505
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:08,787
How are you feeling this morning?

506
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:13,628
You hurt Lili.

507
00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:19,972
I'm afraid your husband's
aberrant thinking persists.

508
00:50:22,472 --> 00:50:24,642
Do you keep a lock on your wardrobe?

509
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:25,808
Of course not.

510
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:28,562
Mrs. Wegener,
you're not encouraging this delusion?

511
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:32,067
You do understand that
your husband is insane?

512
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:34,649
No. That's not true.

513
00:50:35,652 --> 00:50:38,662
We trusted you. We came to you for help.

514
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:05,013
Gerda!

515
00:51:06,016 --> 00:51:07,676
Where have you been?

516
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:09,598
Away.

517
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:11,846
Why? What's wrong?

518
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:14,108
I sold the Lili portraits.

519
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:17,991
I have enough interest, now,
to mount a full show.

520
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:21,028
- That's wonderful.
- And there's more.

521
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:29,828
The Gallery Etienne Dufour in Paris
wants to represent you.

522
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,498
- In Paris?
- Yes, you must go.

523
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,340
I can't travel just now.

524
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:42,183
Gerda, this is your moment.

525
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,099
You've waited long enough.

526
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,559
These art dealers can be fickle.

527
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:52,436
Oh!

528
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:18,837
What are you doing?

529
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:20,836
I've been asked to exhibit in Paris.

530
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:24,225
- That's wonderful.
- Yes.

531
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:26,181
We have to go.

532
00:52:26,263 --> 00:52:28,013
Rasmussen said it would
make all the difference.

533
00:52:28,098 --> 00:52:30,428
Gerda, I'm not sure that I can.

534
00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:32,273
I'll take care of you.

535
00:52:32,436 --> 00:52:34,306
Yes, but surely there's no rush.

536
00:52:34,396 --> 00:52:36,356
Can't you just do this one thing for me?

537
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,780
What's happening?

538
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:43,068
I had a letter from Hexler.

539
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:45,951
He wants to lock me up.

540
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,122
Everything will work out for us.

541
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:54,424
Really. I know it.

542
00:52:57,461 --> 00:52:59,461
You just have to trust me.

543
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,130
I do.

544
00:53:26,948 --> 00:53:28,658
Einar's a painter, too.

545
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:31,655
Oh. Do you exhibit in Paris?

546
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:36,002
I think my work's a little introspective
for French taste.

547
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,093
Excuse me. Is the model here?

548
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:40,628
No.

549
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:42,623
She stayed behind in Denmark.

550
00:53:42,714 --> 00:53:45,764
Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.

551
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:48,886
Madame Gerda Wegener...

552
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,370
No, no.

553
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:16,001
I'm sorry.

554
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,060
Will you sit for me?

555
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:39,103
Just as you are.

556
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:42,731
We haven't done that since art school.

557
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:49,115
The teacher,
suddenly at the mercy of the student.

558
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,069
You found it exciting.

559
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:54,736
I can't just now.

560
00:54:56,413 --> 00:54:57,833
I'm sorry.

561
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:00,749
I miss you.

562
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:04,054
I miss you working beside me.

563
00:55:06,715 --> 00:55:09,095
I can't remember the landscape anymore.

564
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:13,966
I can't remember Vejle.

565
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:19,192
Well, you can help me with this background.

566
00:55:20,729 --> 00:55:23,939
What does it need? A kettle-hole lake?

567
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:27,147
A farmhouse? Far off?

568
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:28,947
Gerda.

569
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:11,645
Merci.

570
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:11,651
Well, he's playing with us.
He knows the price.

571
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:14,613
Look, I have to go,
I have some Danish girl waiting to see me.

572
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:16,278
All right.

573
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:17,321
Madame.

574
00:58:25,956 --> 00:58:27,166
Hans Axgil.

575
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,790
Hello. Thank you for seeing me.

576
00:58:30,877 --> 00:58:34,667
Don't thank me yet, I can't represent you.
I don't handle any contemporary art.

577
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:36,928
Of course. I know that.

578
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:39,972
The reviews for your show
were terrific, but...

579
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:43,771
Perhaps if you would let me speak,
things would be clearer.

580
00:58:44,182 --> 00:58:46,312
So, when did you arrive?

581
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:48,101
Six months, almost.

582
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:51,728
I don't know
why Rasmussen gave you my number,

583
00:58:51,773 --> 00:58:53,233
but I'm happy he did.

584
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:56,147
I asked him.

585
00:58:56,194 --> 00:58:59,204
I wanted to meet you to
put a face to a name.

586
00:58:59,698 --> 00:59:00,698
Hmm.

587
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:03,699
I believe you were
a childhood friend of my husband.

588
00:59:05,787 --> 00:59:07,207
You have a husband?

589
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,250
I'm married to Einar Wegener.

590
00:59:13,837 --> 00:59:14,837
Einar?

591
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:16,095
You remember him?

592
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:19,756
Of course I remember him.
We were such friends. How is he?

593
00:59:20,844 --> 00:59:22,394
He told me that you kissed him once.

594
00:59:22,512 --> 00:59:23,892
I what?

595
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:31,271
You're right.
You're right, I remember.

596
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:32,944
We were fooling in the kitchen,

597
00:59:33,023 --> 00:59:35,113
and he was wearing
his grandmother's apron.

598
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:38,322
You know, little boys, playing around.

599
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:41,111
He just looked so pretty in it.
I had to kiss him!

600
00:59:41,198 --> 00:59:43,738
So, yes, I kissed Einar.

601
00:59:44,951 --> 00:59:46,951
The next thing I know,
his father's chasing me out.

602
00:59:50,582 --> 00:59:51,752
Einar, my God.

603
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,632
Why didn't he come today?

604
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:56,551
He doesn't know I'm here.

605
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,920
I don't think he'd like me asking for help.

606
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:04,598
We don't really know people here.
And Einar is... He's...

607
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,390
He's lost his way.

608
01:00:07,474 --> 01:00:09,104
He's not working.

609
01:00:09,184 --> 01:00:12,524
He needs someone to represent him,
someone who knows him.

610
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:17,284
He needs a friend.

611
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,669
I have a new dealer
coming over later.

612
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:34,918
I'd like you to meet him.

613
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:38,756
I don't want a new dealer.

614
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:41,844
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'm hardly working.

615
01:00:41,925 --> 01:00:43,505
That might change.

616
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:45,929
I don't think so.

617
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:47,926
I'm happy helping you.

618
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:50,479
It's Hans Axgil.

619
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:56,106
Dinner at La Dauphine at 8:00,
then back here to see the paintings.

620
01:00:57,107 --> 01:00:59,777
He remembers you with great fondness.

621
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,499
It was handmade,
and I've had it since I was four.

622
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:17,841
You know, Einar's still stricken with guilt
about crashing your kite.

623
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:20,055
My kite? I'll tease him about that.

624
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:23,627
No, it's too cruel.

625
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:26,135
Well, if he ever gets here.
Perhaps he doesn't want to see me.

626
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:29,601
No. No, it's not that.

627
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,189
Maybe we should order without him.

628
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,650
Does he abandon you often?

629
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:39,983
Of course not.

630
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,151
I was joking.

631
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:52,328
I can come back another time,
if you think Einar would prefer it.

632
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:54,833
Really.

633
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,335
He's expecting you.

634
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And it'll do him good.

635
01:02:03,715 --> 01:02:05,165
I know this.

636
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,680
The fjord at Vejle,
not far from our houses.

637
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:11,601
Yes, he painted it just before we left.

638
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:15,059
Lili.

639
01:02:17,604 --> 01:02:18,694
Hans.

640
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,903
May I introduce

641
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,527
Lili Wegener.

642
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:26,201
Einar's cousin from home.

643
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:32,043
You cannot imagine how happy I am.

644
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:40,001
We actually met once before, in Vejle,
but you probably don't remember.

645
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,590
May I take your coat?

646
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:46,674
Of course.

647
01:02:49,177 --> 01:02:50,757
A digestif, Hans?

648
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,559
It's so chilly all of a sudden.

649
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:00,814
I feel the cold these days.
I don't know why.

650
01:03:01,064 --> 01:03:02,274
Here.

651
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:04,443
Thank you.

652
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:10,992
I'm so sorry that Einar couldn't be here.

653
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:16,123
He told me how, back in Vejle,
you were his great friend.

654
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:19,829
- Both always plotting to get away.
- That's true.

655
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,920
Such a tedious place!

656
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:28,763
He said that you would sit
and you'd look out together,

657
01:03:28,925 --> 01:03:31,085
beyond the fjord, to the sea.

658
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:33,682
To the future.

659
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:35,677
We had big dreams, yes.

660
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:38,177
Yes.

661
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:43,273
And that you were the only one
that would let him paint in peace.

662
01:03:44,149 --> 01:03:46,439
Who told him it was all
right to be a painter.

663
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,190
He used to sketch my portrait.

664
01:03:49,112 --> 01:03:52,122
Take a stone and draw me on the rocks
at the side of the road.

665
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:56,535
I didn't know that.

666
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:58,123
Yes.

667
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:02,634
Would you like to see more of Einar's work?

668
01:04:02,793 --> 01:04:04,043
- Yes.
- But do we have any?

669
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:05,958
Of course, Lili.

670
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:07,839
Could we not do it another time?
Because I just...

671
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,876
I want to hear more about you, Hans.

672
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:10,966
Are you married?

673
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:12,934
- Uh, no.
- Well, why not?

674
01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:17,808
You don't mind, do you?

675
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:21,019
I've been on my own a long time now.
I'm too set in my ways.

676
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:27,357
I think that marriage is the single thing
we should all hope for in life.

677
01:04:27,984 --> 01:04:28,994
Really?

678
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:32,533
It creates someone else.

679
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,910
More than just the two of you.

680
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:40,752
Yes, I think it'd be terrible not to...

681
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:47,247
I think it'd be terrible... I'm so...
Will you excuse me?

682
01:04:47,754 --> 01:04:48,764
Lili.

683
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:04,943
You ought to go.

684
01:05:05,188 --> 01:05:06,268
Let me help.

685
01:05:09,234 --> 01:05:10,614
Please.

686
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,703
I'm sorry.

687
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:23,369
Good night, Lili.

688
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,131
Good night.

689
01:05:35,594 --> 01:05:37,804
I don't think he noticed, do you?

690
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:40,886
I don't know.

691
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:44,564
I think I got out just in time.

692
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:48,397
Sleep now.

693
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:50,983
We'll talk more tomorrow.

694
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,321
Can I borrow a nightdress?

695
01:06:01,453 --> 01:06:03,163
No, we've never done that.

696
01:06:05,415 --> 01:06:07,495
Lili's never spent the night.

697
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:11,127
It doesn't matter what I wear.

698
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:17,139
'Cause when I dream,

699
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:21,012
they're Lili's dreams.

700
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:54,131
What?

701
01:07:00,971 --> 01:07:02,141
A new dress.

702
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:03,642
And this is for you.

703
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:06,977
Do you like it?

704
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,230
Yes.

705
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:14,279
It's perfect for you.

706
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:16,077
We're a little short of
money at the moment.

707
01:07:16,153 --> 01:07:17,493
I know.

708
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:19,369
But now that I'm back,
I can sit for you again.

709
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:24,581
Well, it worked well before.
Didn't it work?

710
01:07:27,456 --> 01:07:30,116
Come on. Come on, Hvap.

711
01:07:36,214 --> 01:07:37,844
Looks good.

712
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:38,933
Head up.

713
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:40,642
Up. There.

714
01:07:40,886 --> 01:07:42,216
- No, back.
- Yes. Okay.

715
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:52,687
- Is that good?
- Ring, up.

716
01:07:58,904 --> 01:08:00,364
Thank you.

717
01:08:23,387 --> 01:08:25,047
I didn't know you were coming.

718
01:08:25,806 --> 01:08:26,966
It's a good crowd.

719
01:08:27,224 --> 01:08:28,734
She's a popular girl.

720
01:08:30,435 --> 01:08:32,055
Thank you for coming.

721
01:08:33,313 --> 01:08:36,573
Thank you for inviting me.
I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

722
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:37,938
We've been busy.

723
01:08:39,653 --> 01:08:40,903
Is Einar here?

724
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:44,238
He hates this kind of thing.

725
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:45,534
That's a shame.

726
01:08:46,076 --> 01:08:47,486
For you, I mean.

727
01:08:48,578 --> 01:08:49,698
I don't mind.

728
01:08:49,746 --> 01:08:50,906
Is he well?

729
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:52,828
He's excited.

730
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,542
Our friend, uh, is coming to town,

731
01:08:55,585 --> 01:08:57,425
Ulla Fonsmarck, the dancer.
You maybe know her?

732
01:08:57,462 --> 01:08:59,552
No, I don't think so.

733
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:03,932
Can I take you to dinner?

734
01:09:05,137 --> 01:09:06,427
To celebrate?

735
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:08,263
I think someone ought to.

736
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:11,483
No. Thank you.

737
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:12,935
Gerda.

738
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:16,441
Have I offended you?

739
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:19,607
No.

740
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,110
Gerda.

741
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:24,698
I'm still Einar's wife.

742
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:32,830
Hans!

743
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,381
Oh, Henri!

744
01:09:52,517 --> 01:09:54,887
At least take an umbrella.

745
01:09:54,978 --> 01:09:57,478
Oh. No, I'm fine, honestly.

746
01:09:57,522 --> 01:09:59,982
Well, if you just wait a minute,
someone will drive you.

747
01:10:00,025 --> 01:10:01,575
No, I'm fine.

748
01:10:24,549 --> 01:10:26,089
My goodness, you're soaked.

749
01:10:28,762 --> 01:10:30,012
Did it go well?

750
01:10:31,014 --> 01:10:32,104
Tell me, how was it?

751
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:36,061
You'd know if you'd been there.

752
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,268
I've made us a supper.

753
01:10:40,357 --> 01:10:41,857
You should have come.

754
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,610
A little sort of celebration.

755
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:46,071
This is not how it goes.

756
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,079
We do these things together.

757
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:55,038
That was you and Einar.

758
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,750
Stop playing that stupid, stupid game.

759
01:10:57,916 --> 01:10:59,456
Please, Gerda.

760
01:11:01,378 --> 01:11:03,378
Don't you think this is a game.

761
01:11:04,548 --> 01:11:06,838
You should have been there!

762
01:11:07,217 --> 01:11:08,717
How could I?

763
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:14,096
- Look at me.
- Not everything is about you.

764
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:24,687
I need to see Einar.

765
01:11:25,235 --> 01:11:26,945
Let me help, please.

766
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:28,448
I need my husband.

767
01:11:29,948 --> 01:11:31,408
Go get him.

768
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:36,078
I can't.

769
01:11:36,246 --> 01:11:40,036
I need to talk to my husband.
I need to hold my husband.

770
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,497
I need him.

771
01:11:44,588 --> 01:11:46,588
Can't you just get him?

772
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:52,467
Can you at least try?

773
01:11:57,684 --> 01:11:58,944
No. I'm sorry.

774
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:33,135
Gerda.

775
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:36,013
What is it?

776
01:12:48,193 --> 01:12:49,863
Are you all right?

777
01:13:09,673 --> 01:13:10,923
Oh, my God.

778
01:13:15,345 --> 01:13:16,345
Gerda, wait.

779
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,255
Wait!

780
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:52,628
I don't think I can

781
01:13:52,799 --> 01:13:54,379
give you what you want.

782
01:14:09,608 --> 01:14:12,318
I don't know how long
we can go on like this.

783
01:14:17,449 --> 01:14:18,659
No.

784
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:31,089
He needs to see someone.

785
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:32,763
You know what happened with Hexler.

786
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,220
But he's so thin.

787
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:37,551
Something's wrong with him.

788
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:41,184
Lili watches her figure.

789
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:44,102
Look.

790
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:48,102
There's a doctor.
He runs the Women's Clinic in Dresden.

791
01:14:48,188 --> 01:14:50,228
He's interested in men like Einar

792
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:52,695
who are

793
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:54,245
confused.

794
01:14:56,196 --> 01:14:57,906
Men who are different.

795
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:01,081
He's often in Paris.

796
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:02,663
Just talk to him.

797
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:12,416
You're awake.

798
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:14,091
How do you feel?

799
01:15:16,675 --> 01:15:17,765
Come.

800
01:15:18,301 --> 01:15:19,841
Listen, I've got somewhere to go.

801
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:21,105
Where?

802
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:25,811
Sorry, I...

803
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:30,485
I don't know
how to hold on to you any longer.

804
01:15:34,693 --> 01:15:35,943
I know.

805
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:39,451
But I love you,

806
01:15:40,824 --> 01:15:42,834
and I'm going to find an answer.

807
01:16:33,752 --> 01:16:35,462
- English?
- English.

808
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,335
Do you speak English?

809
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:39,631
Are you, um, a boy or a girl?

810
01:16:39,716 --> 01:16:41,256
- A woman?
- Do you have a...

811
01:16:42,552 --> 01:16:43,602
Or...

812
01:16:48,308 --> 01:16:49,308
Joking.

813
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:35,977
I can't hold the buyers much longer,
I'm sorry.

814
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:44,451
Einar?

815
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:47,951
You're good at this.

816
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:50,579
I boxed for a while.

817
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:54,327
Shame you weren't with me earlier.

818
01:18:01,673 --> 01:18:03,633
I'm sorry I've not been to see you before.

819
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,970
That's all right.

820
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:07,761
You're here now.

821
01:18:09,306 --> 01:18:11,466
I couldn't let Gerda see me like this.

822
01:18:12,642 --> 01:18:14,312
She's had enough to put up with.

823
01:18:14,644 --> 01:18:16,154
What's happened to you?

824
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:20,145
I don't understand.

825
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:23,697
Nor do I.

826
01:18:27,532 --> 01:18:29,622
But I don't think it's anything new.

827
01:18:31,495 --> 01:18:33,005
Even back in Vejle...

828
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,330
- What?
- Ow. Sorry.

829
01:18:40,337 --> 01:18:41,497
What?

830
01:18:42,923 --> 01:18:44,423
I was different.

831
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:49,180
It didn't take much to
be different in Vejle.

832
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:51,386
Surely that's why we became friends.

833
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:55,976
Every morning

834
01:18:57,062 --> 01:19:01,152
I promise myself
that I will spend the entire day as Einar.

835
01:19:02,859 --> 01:19:05,189
But there's so little of Einar left.

836
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,991
You think these things
because you're exhausted.

837
01:19:12,035 --> 01:19:15,035
Sometimes I think about killing Einar.

838
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:21,213
But it's only the thought
that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.

839
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:24,047
You need to see someone.

840
01:19:25,048 --> 01:19:27,048
- A doctor.
- No.

841
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:28,512
- Yes.
- No doctors.

842
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,299
I'll help you find someone.

843
01:19:31,722 --> 01:19:33,512
You have to try.

844
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:38,983
A confused state of identity.

845
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:43,068
I drill small holes,

846
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:45,744
here and here.

847
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:48,575
I have listened to you very carefully,

848
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:51,413
and I'm afraid it's not good news.

849
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:53,281
You're a homosexual.

850
01:19:55,412 --> 01:19:58,582
Well, I don't really know
what kind of help I need, but I...

851
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,460
I can't go on living
without knowing who I am.

852
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:04,745
Please excuse me for a moment.

853
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:02,651
Do you think I'm insane?

854
01:21:08,068 --> 01:21:09,488
Did a doctor say that?

855
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:12,705
I'm sorry. I know we agreed no more, but...

856
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:16,447
Look at me.

857
01:21:16,493 --> 01:21:18,493
You are not insane.

858
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,000
Did I do this to you?

859
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,840
What?

860
01:21:31,883 --> 01:21:34,933
Sometimes, I... I wonder...

861
01:21:35,512 --> 01:21:37,182
If it hadn't been for the paintings...

862
01:21:37,222 --> 01:21:38,892
No. Gerda, no.

863
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:44,731
You helped bring Lili to life,
but she was always there.

864
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:47,189
She was always waiting.

865
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:49,441
Now she's making you ill.

866
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,200
I don't know what to do.

867
01:21:57,534 --> 01:21:59,544
The doctors can't help me.

868
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:06,882
Do you want to try one more?

869
01:22:17,429 --> 01:22:19,599
...Warnekros, Einar. My husband.

870
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:21,311
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

871
01:22:22,559 --> 01:22:24,229
So, what do you think would explain

872
01:22:24,269 --> 01:22:26,559
what you've been experiencing,
Mr. Wegener?

873
01:22:27,064 --> 01:22:29,234
Professor Warnekros, the fact is

874
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,149
I believe that I am a woman,

875
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,409
inside.

876
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:41,079
And I believe it too.

877
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:50,747
You probably think that I'm insane.

878
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:54,092
Or that we both are.

879
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:56,091
Well,

880
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:58,846
there are people who think that I'm insane.

881
01:23:03,225 --> 01:23:05,145
But I think you're probably right.

882
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:12,943
I've met another man like you.

883
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:16,111
I pursued his case,

884
01:23:16,947 --> 01:23:18,787
against the wishes of my colleagues,
of course.

885
01:23:20,283 --> 01:23:21,873
I told him I could operate

886
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:24,753
to make him fully a woman.

887
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,328
That was what he wanted.

888
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,787
Is that really possible?

889
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:31,336
What happened to the man?

890
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:33,005
Was the operation successful?

891
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,628
On the morning of the first operation,
he ran away.

892
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,433
He was too frightened.

893
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:39,797
I wouldn't do that. I...

894
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:42,143
Perhaps he was the smart one.

895
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:44,681
The surgery has never
been attempted before.

896
01:23:44,808 --> 01:23:46,138
Never.

897
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:51,401
Professor Warnekros, what is the surgery?

898
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:52,985
Two operations.

899
01:23:53,734 --> 01:23:55,654
The first,
to remove the male parts entirely.

900
01:23:57,571 --> 01:23:59,291
The second,
once you're strong enough again,

901
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:01,824
to construct a vagina.

902
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,673
An irreversible change

903
01:24:14,004 --> 01:24:15,674
and a high risk of failure.

904
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,090
Infections.

905
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:19,632
Complications.

906
01:24:19,676 --> 01:24:21,176
It's too dangerous.

907
01:24:21,344 --> 01:24:23,354
It's my only hope.

908
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:28,273
I leave for Dresden at lunchtime tomorrow.

909
01:24:32,147 --> 01:24:33,767
Mrs. Wegener,

910
01:24:35,358 --> 01:24:37,438
I do believe I can help your husband.

911
01:24:39,362 --> 01:24:42,242
But he won't be your husband
when I've finished.

912
01:24:58,632 --> 01:25:00,342
I feel strange going dressed like this.

913
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:01,719
It's important.

914
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:04,799
Hans said
the Germans might check your papers.

915
01:25:05,055 --> 01:25:06,315
You're nearly there.

916
01:25:07,891 --> 01:25:09,391
I won't be seeing you again.

917
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:14,899
I've only really liked
a handful of people in my life,

918
01:25:16,733 --> 01:25:17,853
and you've been two of them.

919
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:24,124
Take care.

920
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:29,498
Take care.

921
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:36,841
I wish you'd let me come with you.

922
01:25:38,088 --> 01:25:39,258
I can't.

923
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:42,592
You love Einar,

924
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,050
and I have to let him go.

925
01:25:52,102 --> 01:25:53,192
Here.

926
01:25:54,312 --> 01:25:55,652
Take this.

927
01:27:52,055 --> 01:27:53,215
Hello.

928
01:27:53,682 --> 01:27:56,732
Um... My name is Lili.
I'm here to see Professor Warnekros.

929
01:27:57,519 --> 01:27:58,809
Lili what?

930
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:02,228
Elbe.

931
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:05,324
Lili Elbe, like the river.

932
01:28:05,485 --> 01:28:08,905
Of course. Please take a seat over there.

933
01:28:37,017 --> 01:28:38,427
Must I really wait?

934
01:28:39,352 --> 01:28:40,352
It's only a week.

935
01:28:41,938 --> 01:28:44,648
I need you to rest. Gain some weight.

936
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:46,363
We can't risk an infection.

937
01:28:50,572 --> 01:28:52,572
For what we are attempting,

938
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,162
I'll need you to be strong.

939
01:28:58,455 --> 01:29:00,045
This is not my body, Professor.

940
01:29:02,334 --> 01:29:04,094
Please take it away.

941
01:29:11,802 --> 01:29:13,392
You're having a baby.

942
01:29:15,806 --> 01:29:16,846
And you?

943
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:19,641
Oh, no, no. I'm...

944
01:29:20,685 --> 01:29:22,515
I'm ill inside.

945
01:29:22,604 --> 01:29:25,064
But Professor Warnekros
is going to make me better.

946
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:27,318
And will you be able to
have children after?

947
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:30,741
Do you know, I don't know.

948
01:29:34,157 --> 01:29:35,657
I hope so.

949
01:29:40,706 --> 01:29:42,366
Gerda, why don't you go?

950
01:29:45,335 --> 01:29:47,545
- He asked me not to.
- He wanted to protect you.

951
01:29:47,629 --> 01:29:49,419
You should be there. I'll go with you.

952
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:51,671
If I go, it will be alone.

953
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,430
Now you're sounding like Einar.

954
01:29:55,887 --> 01:29:57,507
I am like Einar.

955
01:30:00,392 --> 01:30:02,022
What do you want me to do?

956
01:30:02,352 --> 01:30:04,102
I want you to go away.

957
01:30:04,312 --> 01:30:05,312
Really?

958
01:30:13,447 --> 01:30:15,617
No, I... Sorry.

959
01:31:21,598 --> 01:31:24,428
She regained
consciousness very briefly.

960
01:31:24,518 --> 01:31:27,268
We're having to give her
a great deal of morphine, of course,

961
01:31:27,354 --> 01:31:29,274
so that's to be expected.

962
01:31:33,193 --> 01:31:34,943
You mustn't move, Lili.

963
01:31:35,028 --> 01:31:36,488
It only makes it worse.

964
01:31:37,114 --> 01:31:38,244
Oh, God.

965
01:31:39,324 --> 01:31:40,414
Breathe.

966
01:31:41,493 --> 01:31:42,793
Breathe.

967
01:31:42,911 --> 01:31:43,951
Breathe.

968
01:31:50,836 --> 01:31:52,246
I'm here.

969
01:32:00,887 --> 01:32:01,927
It's all right.

970
01:32:02,848 --> 01:32:04,268
I'm here now.

971
01:32:08,812 --> 01:32:10,312
Lili.

972
01:32:31,543 --> 01:32:34,843
I can feel myself getting better
when I listen to your pencil.

973
01:32:41,428 --> 01:32:43,188
You've always sketched
me better than I was.

974
01:32:46,433 --> 01:32:48,393
But what you draw, I become.

975
01:32:51,855 --> 01:32:53,485
You made me beautiful.

976
01:32:55,692 --> 01:32:57,652
And now you're making me strong.

977
01:33:01,698 --> 01:33:03,618
Such power in you.

978
01:33:10,624 --> 01:33:12,884
Shall we go back to Denmark, then, Gerda?

979
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,050
Shall we go home?

980
01:33:35,232 --> 01:33:36,232
Lili!

981
01:33:36,983 --> 01:33:37,983
You're late.

982
01:33:41,154 --> 01:33:43,244
And your pills.

983
01:33:43,281 --> 01:33:46,411
Every two hours,
and I need to eat something first.

984
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:48,541
I have some macaroons in my bag all ready.

985
01:33:50,163 --> 01:33:51,213
And these.

986
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,251
Only if you need them.

987
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:03,841
Good luck.

988
01:34:13,103 --> 01:34:14,273
And remember,

989
01:34:14,312 --> 01:34:17,902
making a purchase at Fonnesbech's
is not merely shopping.

990
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:19,821
It's an experience.

991
01:34:19,985 --> 01:34:21,535
You lived in Paris, yes?

992
01:34:22,612 --> 01:34:23,612
Yes.

993
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:26,777
Let everyone know.
The store is a stage.

994
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:29,450
We're here to perform.

995
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:40,505
In Paris, you see, a lady would never dream
of spraying the scent directly onto herself.

996
01:34:40,672 --> 01:34:43,172
She... She would spray it in the air,

997
01:34:43,967 --> 01:34:46,007
and then she'd walk through it.

998
01:34:46,219 --> 01:34:47,509
- Oh.
- Voila.

999
01:34:49,347 --> 01:34:50,467
You try.

1000
01:34:54,936 --> 01:34:57,306
Ah. Voila.

1001
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:09,116
Thanks.

1002
01:35:09,159 --> 01:35:10,409
That's so unfair.

1003
01:35:10,577 --> 01:35:14,037
You've got the sweetest tooth
and the narrowest hips in the whole store.

1004
01:35:14,122 --> 01:35:16,292
How do you manage it,
eating so much sugar?

1005
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:18,253
The trick is you eat nothing else.

1006
01:35:18,418 --> 01:35:19,958
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1007
01:35:22,589 --> 01:35:24,009
- Bye, Lili.
- Bye.

1008
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,030
Lili, are you coming?

1009
01:35:33,225 --> 01:35:36,905
You know, one night last week,
I had the strangest dream.

1010
01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:39,146
What was it?

1011
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:40,984
I dreamed you were getting married.

1012
01:35:47,322 --> 01:35:49,032
Do you think I ever will?

1013
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:50,529
Who knows?

1014
01:35:50,742 --> 01:35:53,412
So many strange things have happened.

1015
01:35:54,871 --> 01:35:56,921
I do want to, Gerda.

1016
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:02,504
It's not so long ago we were married,
you and me.

1017
01:36:05,507 --> 01:36:07,047
You and Einar.

1018
01:36:10,637 --> 01:36:12,057
I know it was Einar.

1019
01:36:12,222 --> 01:36:13,682
But really,

1020
01:36:15,642 --> 01:36:18,392
it was you and me.

1021
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:41,423
Lili.

1022
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:45,511
Is it really you?

1023
01:36:47,382 --> 01:36:48,682
I believe so.

1024
01:36:53,722 --> 01:36:56,562
So, what you're suggesting

1025
01:36:58,685 --> 01:37:00,515
is that, uh, a doctor

1026
01:37:03,106 --> 01:37:04,436
intervened.

1027
01:37:04,483 --> 01:37:06,613
To correct a mistake in nature.

1028
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:08,952
He made you a woman.

1029
01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:11,614
No, God made me a woman.

1030
01:37:11,656 --> 01:37:13,906
But the doctor... He... The doctor

1031
01:37:14,076 --> 01:37:17,696
is curing me of the sickness
that was my disguise.

1032
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,715
A real woman.

1033
01:37:41,061 --> 01:37:43,401
You're going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like that.

1034
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,190
When Warnekros suggested I keep a diary,

1035
01:37:46,274 --> 01:37:48,484
I thought I'd never have anything to write.

1036
01:37:50,112 --> 01:37:52,112
It does help,

1037
01:37:52,155 --> 01:37:53,485
just to make sense of things.

1038
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:55,620
Maybe I should try it.

1039
01:38:01,206 --> 01:38:02,246
So,

1040
01:38:03,667 --> 01:38:05,667
do you enjoy working at Fonnesbech's?

1041
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,001
For now, at least.

1042
01:38:08,046 --> 01:38:10,006
I do enjoy sort of being part of it.

1043
01:38:10,841 --> 01:38:12,381
You never think of painting?

1044
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:16,854
You might be good at it.

1045
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:19,430
Gerda, I want to be a woman, not a painter.

1046
01:38:20,559 --> 01:38:22,849
Well, people have been known to do both.

1047
01:38:27,315 --> 01:38:30,185
I'm curious to see what you would paint.

1048
01:38:30,235 --> 01:38:32,525
That's all. Sometimes it's
hard to know what's in your...

1049
01:38:32,696 --> 01:38:34,986
Didn't you just take one of those
a minute ago?

1050
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,120
Gerda, I know what I'm doing.

1051
01:38:41,204 --> 01:38:43,084
I'm just going to get some fresh air.

1052
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:47,208
You know, sometimes I do wonder
why you let me go through all this,

1053
01:38:47,252 --> 01:38:49,302
if you thought that
everything would be the same afterwards.

1054
01:38:49,379 --> 01:38:50,879
I didn't.

1055
01:38:51,757 --> 01:38:53,757
But I promised Einar
that I would take care of you.

1056
01:38:53,842 --> 01:38:56,182
For goodness' sakes, Gerda, Einar is dead.

1057
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:57,889
We both have to accept that.

1058
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,563
You took care of me,
but now I have to take care of myself.

1059
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:04,691
I have to have a life of my own.

1060
01:39:06,563 --> 01:39:08,613
And you need to do the same.

1061
01:39:11,943 --> 01:39:13,073
Come on, Hvap.

1062
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:30,461
Uh, yes.

1063
01:39:31,713 --> 01:39:32,883
In London.

1064
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:35,433
Uh, is it urgent?

1065
01:39:36,009 --> 01:39:37,429
No, that's fine.

1066
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:39,637
Just tell him...

1067
01:39:41,973 --> 01:39:44,023
Just say it's a beautiful
day in Copenhagen.

1068
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,940
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1069
01:40:15,966 --> 01:40:18,836
It's not what you think.
Henrik's homosexual.

1070
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:20,970
There's nothing between us.

1071
01:40:22,723 --> 01:40:24,723
I should have told you that I'd seen him.

1072
01:40:25,016 --> 01:40:26,636
No, you shouldn't.

1073
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:28,824
He's a friend, Gerdie, someone to talk to.

1074
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:31,364
Because you can't talk to me.

1075
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:34,823
I've made a decision.

1076
01:40:36,153 --> 01:40:38,203
I'm going back to Dresden
for the second operation.

1077
01:40:38,989 --> 01:40:40,199
That's too soon.

1078
01:40:40,282 --> 01:40:41,782
No... No, it's time.

1079
01:40:42,075 --> 01:40:44,155
I need to finish what I started.

1080
01:40:44,244 --> 01:40:45,254
You're not strong enough.

1081
01:40:45,328 --> 01:40:47,458
Professor Warnekros thinks that I am.

1082
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:49,711
Warnekros?

1083
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:51,333
Warnekros hasn't seen you.

1084
01:40:51,418 --> 01:40:52,628
I've made up my mind, Gerda.

1085
01:40:53,837 --> 01:40:55,167
It could kill you.

1086
01:40:55,213 --> 01:40:57,383
I'm going on Friday. Will you come with me?

1087
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:03,851
I won't help you to hurt yourself.

1088
01:41:21,364 --> 01:41:22,874
Gerda, will you come?

1089
01:41:44,679 --> 01:41:47,059
This will be harder than
the first operation.

1090
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:49,685
You understand that?

1091
01:41:50,894 --> 01:41:53,354
Yes, I do.

1092
01:41:55,857 --> 01:41:57,727
It's complex surgery.

1093
01:41:59,903 --> 01:42:02,863
And I will sleep all the way through it.

1094
01:42:06,201 --> 01:42:07,291
Yes, you will.

1095
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:09,871
And you'll be there when I wake up.

1096
01:42:12,207 --> 01:42:13,577
Of course.

1097
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:17,004
I want a husband who looks just like you.

1098
01:42:20,382 --> 01:42:21,382
Um...

1099
01:42:22,092 --> 01:42:24,092
Maybe a child one day.

1100
01:42:28,348 --> 01:42:30,098
Like a real woman.

1101
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:33,348
One step at a time.

1102
01:42:40,902 --> 01:42:42,992
Get some rest. Good night.

1103
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:57,207
Are you still angry with me?

1104
01:42:58,628 --> 01:43:00,378
I'm not angry with you.

1105
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:04,180
I'm worried about you.

1106
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:08,009
You heard my wish, Gerda.

1107
01:43:09,598 --> 01:43:11,428
When no one else could hear me,

1108
01:43:12,726 --> 01:43:14,306
you did.

1109
01:43:19,232 --> 01:43:20,362
Come.

1110
01:43:21,193 --> 01:43:22,823
We both need our rest.

1111
01:43:23,653 --> 01:43:24,853
I'll sleep on the chair there.

1112
01:43:26,907 --> 01:43:29,527
- No, off to your little hotel.
- I don't mind.

1113
01:43:29,618 --> 01:43:31,158
Here, take this.

1114
01:43:31,203 --> 01:43:32,703
Because there's a chill in the air.

1115
01:43:35,499 --> 01:43:37,709
- No.
- Please.

1116
01:43:37,793 --> 01:43:40,093
You have it. For now.

1117
01:43:41,797 --> 01:43:43,507
I'm going to be fine.

1118
01:43:44,549 --> 01:43:45,679
Yes.

1119
01:43:57,229 --> 01:43:58,399
Sleep well.

1120
01:43:59,189 --> 01:44:00,609
Good night.

1121
01:44:48,864 --> 01:44:49,954
Good evening.

1122
01:44:52,242 --> 01:44:53,742
Uh, room nine, please.

1123
01:44:53,827 --> 01:44:55,117
Number nine, yes, of course.

1124
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:56,540
Thank you.

1125
01:45:02,919 --> 01:45:04,249
Hans.

1126
01:45:15,223 --> 01:45:16,773
It's all right.

1127
01:45:16,975 --> 01:45:19,475
Everything will be all right.

1128
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:39,289
Miss Elbe.

1129
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:42,501
It's time.

1130
01:45:55,389 --> 01:45:57,389
Good luck, everybody.

1131
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,440
Swab, quick.

1132
01:46:16,493 --> 01:46:19,003
Professor Warnekros would like a word.

1133
01:46:22,124 --> 01:46:24,004
She lost a lot of blood.

1134
01:46:24,084 --> 01:46:26,794
Now we are struggling
to keep the fever down.

1135
01:46:26,837 --> 01:46:29,337
There's a chance it might
burn itself out, but...

1136
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,089
I have to be honest.

1137
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,100
The prognosis is not...

1138
01:46:42,728 --> 01:46:45,148
Come here. Just lie still.

1139
01:46:46,481 --> 01:46:48,521
It's all right. Shh.

1140
01:47:00,287 --> 01:47:01,697
Shh.

1141
01:47:33,653 --> 01:47:34,953
Lili.

1142
01:47:51,505 --> 01:47:52,595
How are you, Lili?

1143
01:48:02,307 --> 01:48:03,727
I am

1144
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:07,850
entirely myself.

1145
01:48:11,233 --> 01:48:13,323
You had us worried there, you know?

1146
01:48:16,113 --> 01:48:19,283
Can we go outside, Gerda?

1147
01:48:22,327 --> 01:48:24,157
Into the garden?

1148
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:25,959
You should rest.

1149
01:48:32,045 --> 01:48:33,335
Please.

1150
01:48:53,817 --> 01:48:56,947
You mustn't worry about me anymore, Gerda.

1151
01:48:59,281 --> 01:49:00,911
It's an old habit.

1152
01:49:02,409 --> 01:49:03,449
I'm slow to change.

1153
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:12,838
How have I ever deserved such love?

1154
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:22,097
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

1155
01:49:23,555 --> 01:49:24,845
No.

1156
01:49:28,351 --> 01:49:29,771
Last night

1157
01:49:31,772 --> 01:49:34,692
I had the most beautiful dream.

1158
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:43,490
I dreamed that I was a baby
in my mother's arms.

1159
01:49:46,995 --> 01:49:48,995
And she looked down at me,

1160
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:54,500
and she called me Lili.

1161
01:49:57,255 --> 01:49:58,795
Lili.

1162
01:50:25,158 --> 01:50:26,278
Lili?

1163
01:50:35,585 --> 01:50:37,125
Lili!

1164
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:53,330
No, leave it!

1165
01:51:59,586 --> 01:52:01,166
Let it fly.
