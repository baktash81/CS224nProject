1
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,361
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,488
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,199
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,658
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,885
Mr. Ullman?

6
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,345
I'm Jack Torrance.

7
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,514
Come on in, Jack.

8
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,142
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

9
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,894
This is my secretary, Susie.

10
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,772
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

11
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,817
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

12
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,944
That's very good time.

13
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,862
Sit down a minute, Jack.

14
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,864
Just make yourself at home.

15
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,324
Like some coffee?

16
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,035
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

17
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
-Susie.
-Sure.

18
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,163
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

19
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,790
Yes, I will.

20
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,802
Mom?

21
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,846
Yeah?

22
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,891
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

23
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,852
Sure I do.

24
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,021
It'll be lots of fun.

25
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,983
Yeah. I guess so.

26
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,320
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

27
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,783
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

28
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,537
Yeah, I guess so.

29
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,330
What about Tony?

30
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,958
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

31
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,836
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

32
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,714
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

33
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,091
I don't want to go there.

34
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,594
How come you don't want to go?

35
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,929
I just don't.

36
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,932
Let's just wait and see.

37
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,894
We're all going to have
a real good time.

38
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,731
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

39
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,358
How do you do, Bill?

40
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,568
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

41
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,695
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

42
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:25,033
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

43
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,244
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

44
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,371
Fine.

45
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,873
Jack is a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,125
Formerly a schoolteacher.

47
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,044
What line of work are you in now?

48
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,837
I'm a writer.

49
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,716
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

50
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,885
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

51
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,596
I'm looking for a change.

52
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,392
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,227
...l agree with them.

54
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,646
Let's see, where were we?

55
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,440
I was about to explain...

56
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,861
...that our season here runs from
May 1 5th to October 30th.

57
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,532
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

58
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,535
Do you mind if I ask
why you do that?

59
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,205
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

60
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,958
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

61
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,752
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

62
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,088
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

63
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,674
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

64
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,094
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

65
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,263
...to keep it clear.

66
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,807
When the place was built in 1907...

67
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,560
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

68
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:38,648
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

69
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
It's certainly got
plenty of that.

70
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,819
That's right.

71
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,364
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

72
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,241
...about what the job entails?

73
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,535
Only in a very general way.

74
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,582
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,252
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,463
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,090
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:08,261
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,181
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,225
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,520
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,899
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,277
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,113
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:32,786
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,289
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

87
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,959
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,462
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,965
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,926
...solitude...

91
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,761
...and isolation...

92
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,889
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,308
Not for me.

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,062
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,023
They'll love it.

96
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,441
Great.

97
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,572
Before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,284
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,911
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,664
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,083
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,005
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,134
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,761
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,016
My predecessor in this job...

107
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,020
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

108
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,732
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

109
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,943
He had a good employment record,
good references.

110
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,404
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

111
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,323
...like a completely
normal individual.

112
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,868
But at some point
during the winter...

113
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,705
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

114
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,291
He ran amuck...

115
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,880
...and killed his family
with an ax.

116
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:12,802
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

117
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,307
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

118
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,352
The police thought...

119
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,606
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

120
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,859
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

121
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,197
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

122
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,703
That is...

123
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,413
...quite a story.

124
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,166
Yeah, it is.

125
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,545
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

126
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,589
But it did.

127
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:55,387
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

128
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,431
I certainly can.

129
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,518
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

130
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,978
...left it for you to tell me.

131
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,899
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

132
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,195
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

133
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:17,283
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

134
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,162
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

135
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,208
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

136
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,253
She's a confirmed ghost story...

137
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,880
...and horror film addict.

138
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,431
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

139
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,018
He already did.

140
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,188
He 's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

141
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,581
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, hon. How's it going?

142
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,376
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

143
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,713
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

144
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,423
Sounds like you got the job.

145
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,301
Right. It's a beautiful place.

146
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,636
You and Danny are going to love it.

147
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,016
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

148
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,018
I don't know.

149
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,606
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

150
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,275
I don't want to.

151
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,235
Please.

152
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,613
No.

153
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,990
Now, Tony, tell me.

154
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,648
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

155
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,363
That's good. Now the other one.

156
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,199
Good boy.

157
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,916
Now, Danny...

158
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,419
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

159
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,630
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

160
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,593
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

161
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,597
No.

162
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,184
Do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth?

163
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,061
Yes.

164
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,816
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

165
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,656
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

166
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,079
Can you remember
what you were doing...

167
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,207
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

168
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,462
Talking to Tony.

169
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,506
Is Tony one of your animals?

170
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,302
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

171
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,013
Tony's his imaginary friend.

172
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,353
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

173
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,231
Why not?

174
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,360
Because he hides.

175
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,737
Where does he go?

176
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,656
To my stomach.

177
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,578
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

178
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,335
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

179
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,422
That's fine.

180
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,966
All right, Danny.

181
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,595
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

182
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,140
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

183
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,475
Do I have to?

184
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,936
Yes. I'd like you to.

185
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,939
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

186
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,274
I'll come back and check on you.

187
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,160
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

188
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,749
-Please.
-Thank you.

189
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,966
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

190
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

191
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,103
He seems absolutely fine now.

192
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,271
But you should've seen him.

193
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,981
I know.

194
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,899
Kids can scare you to death.

195
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,986
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

196
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,739
And they look much worse
than they are.

197
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,950
But what was the matter with him?

198
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,246
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

199
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:18,335
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

200
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,088
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

201
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,258
...a kind of self-induced trance.

202
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,469
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

203
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,431
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

204
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,311
I'm sure you're right.

205
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,648
Have you been in Boulder long?

206
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,734
Only about three months.

207
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,321
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

208
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,118
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

209
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,370
Tony.

210
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,540
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

211
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,003
Let's see....

212
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,256
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

213
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,176
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

214
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,887
Did he adjust well to school?

215
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,016
He didn't like it too much
at first.

216
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,520
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

217
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,817
I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

218
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,237
What sort of injury did he have?

219
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,073
He dislocated his shoulder.

220
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,784
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,249
It was just one of
those things, you know.

222
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,459
Purely an accident.

223
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,213
My husband had been drinking...

224
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,758
...and he came home
about three hours late.

225
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,638
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

226
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,144
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

227
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,648
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

228
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,901
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

229
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,154
...you know, in a park
or in the street.

230
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,907
But on this particular occasion...

231
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,744
...my husband just used
too much strength...

232
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,538
...and he injured Danny's arm.

233
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:26,087
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said...

234
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,882
..."Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

235
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,051
And if I do, you can leave me."

236
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,594
And he didn't.

237
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:37,265
He hasn't had any
alcohol in 5 months.

238
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:08,296
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

239
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,178
Dad?

240
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,683
I'm hungry.

241
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,270
You should've eaten your breakfast.

242
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,982
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

243
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,818
Okay, Mom.

244
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,407
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

245
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,620
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

246
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,541
What was the Donner party?

247
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:50,755
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

248
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,259
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

249
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,680
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

250
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,684
You mean they ate each other up?

251
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,979
They had to in order to survive.

252
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,439
Jack.

253
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,732
Don't worry, Mom.

254
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,278
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

255
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,114
See, it's okay.

256
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,742
He saw it all on the television.

257
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,274
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

258
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,235
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

259
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,404
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

260
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,741
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

261
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,577
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

262
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,622
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

263
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,540
Is your family
having a look around?

264
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,127
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

265
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,422
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

266
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,966
In view of all we have
to cover today...

267
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:20,845
...l suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

268
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,807
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

269
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,726
I'd better collect my family first.

270
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,237
This is our Colorado Lounge.

271
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,864
It's beautiful.

272
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,117
My God!

273
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,869
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

274
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,413
It sure is.

275
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,416
I've never seen anything
like this before.

276
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,044
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

277
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,671
I believe they're based...

278
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,091
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

279
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,260
They're really gorgeous.

280
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,469
As a matter of fact...

281
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,764
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

282
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,143
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

283
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,438
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

284
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,607
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

285
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,902
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

286
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,446
Lots of movie stars.

287
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,197
Royalty?

288
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,949
All the best people.

289
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,630
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

290
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,967
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

291
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,096
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

292
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,306
And here are your quarters.

293
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,309
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

294
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,020
And a small bedroom for your son.

295
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,651
Perfect for a child.

296
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:50,328
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

297
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,122
Easy to keep.

298
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:55,959
Cozy.

299
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,420
Yes, very cozy for a family.

300
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,338
If you feel like spreading out...

301
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,216
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

302
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,345
Well, it's very...

303
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,180
...homey.

304
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,352
This is our famous hedge maze.

305
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,857
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

306
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,359
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

307
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,195
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

308
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,365
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

309
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,827
When was the Overlook built?

310
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,080
Construction started in 1907.

311
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,249
It was finished in 1909.

312
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,127
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

313
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,962
They actually had to repel...

314
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,049
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

315
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,551
That's our Snowcat.

316
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,304
Can you both drive a car?

317
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,391
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

318
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,186
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

319
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:00,732
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

320
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,069
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

321
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,237
He sure did a beautiful job.

322
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,782
Pink and gold
are my favorite colors.

323
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,951
This is our Gold Ballroom.

324
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,788
I'll say!

325
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:18,750
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

326
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,170
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

327
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,174
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

328
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,427
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

329
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:32,722
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

330
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:33,890
We don't drink.

331
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,517
Then you're in luck.

332
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:39,938
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

333
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,273
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

334
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,235
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

335
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,611
Glad to meet you.

336
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,698
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

337
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,618
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

338
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,704
It's just wonderful.

339
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,414
Hi, Danny!

340
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,042
I found him outside
looking for you.

341
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,130
Did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

342
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,008
Come on over here.

343
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,384
Thank you, Susie.

344
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:13,596
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

345
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,640
...while I continue on with Jack.

346
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,309
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.

347
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,061
Great. See you later, hon.

348
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,646
Bye, darling.

349
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:27,318
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

350
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,071
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

351
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,531
I'm a Wendy.

352
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,951
Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

353
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,786
This is the kitchen, huh?

354
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,580
This is it.

355
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,708
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

356
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,753
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

357
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,339
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

358
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:51,092
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

359
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,845
Don't let it get you down.

360
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,556
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

361
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,975
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

362
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,394
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

363
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:04,731
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

364
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:09,611
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

365
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,906
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

366
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:17,118
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

367
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,329
You got 15 rib roasts...

368
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,664
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

369
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:24,918
We got 1 2 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

370
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:28,213
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

371
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,383
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

372
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,011
You don't?
What's your favorite food, then?

373
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,055
French fries and ketchup.

374
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,808
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

375
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,726
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

376
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,026
How'd you know we call him Doc?

377
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:54,280
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

378
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,907
I did?

379
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,786
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

380
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,246
But how did you know?

381
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,998
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

382
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,459
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

383
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,878
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

384
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,256
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

385
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,134
What's up, Doc?

386
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,179
Now, this is the storeroom.

387
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,725
In here is where we keep...

388
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,728
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

389
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,397
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

390
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:31,401
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

391
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,779
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

392
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:39,034
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

393
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,703
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

394
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,081
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

395
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,216
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

396
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,596
Sociables, finger rolls...

397
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,348
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

398
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,060
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

399
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,396
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

400
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:12,901
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

401
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,447
-How're you getting on?
-Fine.

402
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:21,201
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

403
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,328
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

404
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,748
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

405
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,792
You like ice cream, Doc?

406
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,627
I thought you did.

407
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:33,922
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

408
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,965
-Not at all.
-We don't mind.

409
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,343
-Good.
-Sound good to you, Doc?

410
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,595
Okay, you behave yourself.

411
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,475
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

412
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:46,601
Chocolate.

413
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,771
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

414
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,319
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

415
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,322
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

416
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,990
...last day's always hectic.

417
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,244
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

418
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:08,456
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

419
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,750
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

420
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,384
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

421
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,351
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

422
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:38,820
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

423
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,781
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

424
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,827
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

425
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,205
She called it "shining."

426
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:53,418
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

427
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:56,254
...that had "the shine" to us.

428
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,841
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

429
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,385
But there are other folks...

430
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:06,348
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

431
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,438
How long have you
been able to do it?

432
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,071
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

433
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,328
I'm not supposed to.

434
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,415
Who says you ain't supposed to?

435
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,253
Tony.

436
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,882
Who's Tony?

437
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:46,763
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

438
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,725
Is Tony the one
that...

439
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,519
...tells you things?

440
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,401
How does he tell you things?

441
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:05,573
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

442
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,869
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

443
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:15,417
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

444
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,256
Do they know he tells you things?

445
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:25,093
Tony told me never to tell them.

446
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,598
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

447
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,351
About the Overlook Hotel?

448
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,189
I don't know.

449
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,901
Now think real hard, Doc.

450
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,111
Think.

451
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,950
Maybe he showed me something.

452
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,537
Try to think of what it was.

453
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,835
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

454
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,174
Scared of nothing here.

455
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,134
It's just that...

456
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,721
...you know, some places
are like people.

457
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,265
Some shine...

458
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:13,850
...and some don't.

459
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,228
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

460
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,732
...has something about it
that's like shining.

461
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,154
Is there something bad here?

462
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,210
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

463
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:44,047
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

464
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,383
Say, like...

465
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:49,636
...if someone burns toast.

466
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:56,434
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

467
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:01,022
Not things that anyone
can notice.

468
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:06,027
But things that people
who shine can see.

469
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,448
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

470
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:16,871
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

471
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,292
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

472
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,213
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

473
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,133
And not all of them
was good.

474
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,055
What about room 237?

475
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,602
Room 237?

476
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,024
You're scared of room 237,
ain't you?

477
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,235
No, I ain't.

478
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,532
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

479
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,243
Nothing.

480
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,913
There ain't nothing in room 237.

481
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:02,375
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

482
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,669
So stay out.

483
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:07,380
You understand? Stay out!

484
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,481
Good morning, hon.

485
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,277
Your breakfast is ready.

486
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,654
What time is it?

487
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,740
It's about 11:30.

488
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,243
Jesus.

489
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,621
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

490
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,331
I know it.

491
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,502
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

492
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,379
Nice.

493
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,467
It's really pretty outside.

494
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:18,887
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

495
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:23,850
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

496
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,936
Any ideas yet?

497
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,606
Lots of ideas.

498
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,316
No good ones.

499
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,277
Something will come.

500
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:38,698
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

501
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,993
That's all it is.

502
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,373
It's really nice up here,
isn't it?

503
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,208
I love it.

504
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,335
I really do.

505
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,255
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

506
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:58,218
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

507
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:01,346
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

508
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,682
...l thought it was kind of scary.

509
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,685
I fell in love with it right away.

510
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,188
When I came up here
for my interview...

511
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:14,401
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

512
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,153
I mean, we all have moments
of déjà vu...

513
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,572
...but this was ridiculous.

514
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,200
It was almost as though I knew...

515
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:26,121
...what was going to be
around every corner.

516
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:02,449
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

517
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:05,201
-All right.
-And you're going to lose.

518
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,538
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

519
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,711
Look out!

520
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,755
I'm coming in close.

521
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:19,466
Loser has to keep America clean.

522
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,343
Keep America clean.

523
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:23,803
Danny, you win.

524
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,473
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

525
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,435
Give me your hand.

526
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,856
Isn't it beautiful?

527
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:53,958
Dead end.

528
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,059
We made it.

529
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,811
Isn't it beautiful?

530
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,335
It's so pretty.

531
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,051
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

532
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,564
Rutherford was serving
a life sentence...

533
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,566
...for a 1968 shooting.

534
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:45,570
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

535
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:49,157
24-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

536
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:52,077
She disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband.

537
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:55,080
They may have to
call off the search...

538
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:57,832
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

539
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,876
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

540
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,212
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

541
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,673
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

542
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:09,010
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

543
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,387
And it's moving...

544
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:13,765
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

545
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:43,832
Hi, hon.

546
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,837
How's it going?

547
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:52,549
Fine.

548
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,219
Get a lot written today?

549
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:05,854
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

550
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,361
What do you want me
to do about it?

551
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:17,657
Come on, hon.

552
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,993
Don't be so grouchy.

553
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,745
I'm not...

554
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,329
...being grouchy.

555
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,332
I just want to finish my work.

556
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:32,213
Okay. I understand.

557
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:35,050
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

558
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,886
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

559
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:42,182
Wendy...

560
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,018
...let me explain something to you.

561
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:49,773
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

562
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:51,399
You're distracting me...

563
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:55,070
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

564
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:56,571
Understand?

565
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:01,326
Fine.

566
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:04,245
We're going to make a new rule:

567
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:05,872
Whenever I'm in here...

568
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,333
...and you hear me typing...

569
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:13,088
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

570
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:15,590
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

571
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,009
That means don't come in.

572
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,470
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

573
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,226
Fine.

574
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:30,605
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

575
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,809
All right, you!

576
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:11,021
I know you've got more.

577
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,190
Missed!

578
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:20,613
Don't have!

579
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:22,574
No fair anymore.

580
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,559
I knew it.

581
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:05,260
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1 .

582
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:11,474
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

583
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,811
This is KDK 1 .
We're receiving you. Over.

584
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:18,314
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

585
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:21,693
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

586
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:23,278
We're just fine.

587
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:25,947
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

588
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,200
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

589
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:33,621
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

590
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:37,125
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

591
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:38,501
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

592
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,130
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

593
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:46,051
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

594
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:49,429
Yes. It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

595
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:53,183
Is there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

596
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:55,810
I suppose not. Over.

597
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:59,731
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

598
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,232
And, Mrs. Torrance?

599
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:05,612
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

600
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,947
Okay. We'll do that.

601
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,241
It was real nice talking to you.

602
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,078
Bye. Over and out.

603
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:50,156
Hello, Danny.

604
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,872
Come and play with us.

605
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:05,505
Come and play with us, Danny.

606
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,217
Forever...

607
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,762
...and ever...

608
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,724
...and ever.

609
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:48,840
Tony...

610
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,843
...I'm scared.

611
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,894
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

612
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,358
It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

613
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:08,735
It isn't real.

614
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,873
Please let me give you
some money.

615
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,125
I wouldn't think of it.

616
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,627
Well, how can I repay you?

617
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:28,505
It's okay. Really.

618
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,216
Well, I'm going to have
some coffee.

619
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:32,967
Would you like some?

620
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:35,762
Sure.

621
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,847
Great. Sit down.

622
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:50,360
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

623
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,447
Coffee will be ready
in a few minutes.

624
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:01,579
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

625
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:05,750
Not right now.
Daddy's asleep.

626
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,878
I won't make any noise.

627
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,173
Now come on, Doc.

628
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,092
He only went to bed
a few hours ago.

629
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:16,094
Can't you wait till later?

630
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:19,389
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

631
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,935
All right.

632
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:26,521
But really don't make a sound.

633
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,231
I won't, Mom.

634
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:30,775
Make sure you
come right back...

635
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:32,944
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

636
00:52:35,113 --> 00:52:36,573
Okay, Mom.

637
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,000
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

638
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:34,964
Come here for a minute first.

639
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,753
How's it going, Doc?

640
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:20,135
Having a good time?

641
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,680
Yes, Dad.

642
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:27,809
Good.

643
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,147
I want you to
have a good time.

644
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:34,482
I am, Dad.

645
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:46,703
Do you feel bad?

646
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,961
I'm just a little bit tired.

647
00:54:56,546 --> 00:54:59,090
Then why don't you
go to sleep?

648
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,220
I can't.

649
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,016
I got too much to do.

650
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:19,569
Do you like this hotel?

651
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:26,993
I do.

652
00:55:27,952 --> 00:55:29,287
I love it.

653
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:32,832
Don't you?

654
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,711
I guess so.

655
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,548
Good.

656
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,096
I want you to like it here.

657
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:53,436
I wish we could stay here
forever...

658
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,438
...and ever...

659
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,440
...and ever.

660
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:03,905
What?

661
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:08,284
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

662
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,250
What do you mean?

663
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,966
Did your mother ever
say that to you?

664
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:25,468
That I would hurt you?

665
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:27,595
No, Dad.

666
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:31,307
You sure?

667
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,435
Yes, Dad.

668
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,275
I love you, Danny.

669
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:44,070
I love you
more than anything else...

670
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:46,823
...in the whole world...

671
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,660
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

672
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,203
...never.

673
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,123
You know that, don't you?

674
00:56:55,623 --> 00:56:57,167
Yes, Dad.

675
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,210
Good.

676
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:28,967
Mom, are you in there?

677
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:49,255
What happened?

678
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:50,715
Honey...

679
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:52,967
...what's wrong?

680
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:02,560
I had the most...

681
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,355
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

682
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:10,235
-It was the most horrible dream.
-It's okay, it's okay now.

683
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:12,779
Really.

684
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,660
I dreamed that l...

685
01:00:18,868 --> 01:00:21,287
...that I killed
you and Danny.

686
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,251
But I didn't just kill you.

687
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:30,338
I cut you up
into little pieces.

688
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:34,551
My God.

689
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,804
I must be losing my mind.

690
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:42,726
Everything's going to be
all right.

691
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,522
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

692
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:57,657
There. Now sit up.

693
01:00:58,324 --> 01:00:59,617
It's okay.

694
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:02,162
It's okay.

695
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:07,417
Danny!

696
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,669
Everything's okay!

697
01:01:09,836 --> 01:01:13,006
Just go play in your room
for a while.

698
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,425
Your dad's just got
a headache.

699
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:19,763
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

700
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:24,684
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

701
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:26,394
I'll be right back.

702
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:30,315
Why don't you mind me?

703
01:01:36,946 --> 01:01:38,782
Oh, my God.

704
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:42,369
What happened to your neck?

705
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,456
What happened to your neck?

706
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,362
You did this to him...

707
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:19,239
...didn't you?!

708
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:23,159
You son of a bitch!

709
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,203
You did this to him!

710
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:26,871
Didn't you?!

711
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,833
How could you?!

712
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,835
How could you?!

713
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,761
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

714
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:10,308
I'd give my goddamn soul...

715
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:13,019
...for just a glass of beer.

716
01:04:27,992 --> 01:04:29,494
Hi, Lloyd.

717
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,458
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

718
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:42,590
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

719
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:46,136
What will it be?

720
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,765
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

721
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:54,269
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

722
01:04:54,477 --> 01:04:57,355
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

723
01:04:57,564 --> 01:05:00,817
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

724
01:05:01,526 --> 01:05:03,361
So here's what:

725
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:05,947
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

726
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:08,950
...a little glass and some ice.

727
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:11,202
You can do that,
can't you, Lloyd?

728
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:13,997
You're not too busy, are you?

729
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,083
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

730
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,127
Good man.

731
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:20,545
You set them up...

732
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:23,673
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

733
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:27,761
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

734
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:30,138
White man's burden.

735
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:37,312
Say, Lloyd...

736
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,315
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

737
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:43,068
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

738
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,695
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

739
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:48,031
That's swell.

740
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:49,949
I like you, Lloyd.

741
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:51,826
I always liked you.

742
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,329
You were always the best of them.

743
01:05:54,537 --> 01:05:56,915
Best goddamned bartender...

744
01:05:57,123 --> 01:06:00,043
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

745
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,504
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

746
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:04,506
Thank you for saying so.

747
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:11,554
Here's to 5 miserable months
on the wagon...

748
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:15,850
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

749
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,538
How are things going,
Mr. Torrance?

750
01:06:37,872 --> 01:06:40,458
Things could be better.

751
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,713
Things could be
a whole lot better.

752
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:47,924
I hope it's nothing serious.

753
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:52,929
Nothing serious.

754
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:57,142
Just a little problem with...

755
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:00,478
...the old sperm bank
upstairs.

756
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:03,064
Nothing I can't handle,
though.

757
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,941
Thanks.

758
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:06,401
Women.

759
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:08,153
Can't live with them...

760
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:10,196
...can't live without them.

761
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:14,951
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

762
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,619
Words of...

763
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:18,371
...wisdom.

764
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:33,094
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

765
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:34,929
I didn't.

766
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:41,603
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

767
01:07:42,187 --> 01:07:45,315
I love the little
son of a bitch.

768
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:49,778
I'd do anything for him.

769
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:52,781
Any fucking thing for him.

770
01:07:56,826 --> 01:07:59,412
But that bitch!

771
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:02,123
As long as I live...

772
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:05,794
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

773
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:18,181
I did hurt him once, okay?

774
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:20,642
It was an accident.

775
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,520
Completely unintentional.

776
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:27,023
It could have happened
to anybody.

777
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:32,237
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

778
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:35,281
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

779
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,951
All I tried to do was pull him up.

780
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:45,417
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

781
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:46,960
I mean...

782
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:51,006
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

783
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:54,050
...per second, per second.

784
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:12,068
Thank God you're here.

785
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:17,490
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

786
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:20,243
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

787
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:22,996
She tried to strangle Danny.

788
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,959
Are you out of your fucking mind?

789
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:31,921
It's the truth! Really.

790
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,132
I swear it.
Danny told me.

791
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,343
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

792
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:39,971
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

793
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:42,515
She tried to strangle him!

794
01:09:46,227 --> 01:09:48,021
Which room was it?

795
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:57,781
From Channel 10 in Miami...

796
01:09:57,989 --> 01:10:00,367
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

797
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:04,746
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

798
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,540
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

799
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,877
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

800
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:13,213
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

801
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:16,549
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

802
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:20,720
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.

803
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,181
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

804
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,351
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

805
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,436
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

806
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,397
Railroad tracks are frozen.

807
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:32,649
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

808
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:36,403
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

809
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:38,905
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

810
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,865
...to declare
a weather emergency.

811
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,909
The National Guard
might be called out...

812
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:44,285
...to clear streets and roads.

813
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:46,746
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

814
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,915
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

815
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:51,751
... with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

816
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,963
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

817
01:10:55,171 --> 01:10:57,424
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

818
01:10:57,632 --> 01:10:59,592
Local beaches
should be jammed.

819
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,803
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

820
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:05,265
... will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.
