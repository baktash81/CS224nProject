1
00:01:58,578 --> 00:01:59,870
Johnson!

2
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,497
Yes, sir!

3
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,040
- Honeycutt!
- Here!

4
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,583
- Melvin!
- Here.

5
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,420
Oh, man.
Is that what I think it is?

6
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,882
All right, you cheese dicks,
welcome to the Nam. Follow me!

7
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,558
I'll be dipped in shit!

8
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,478
New meat!
You dudes gonna love the Nam.

9
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,146
For fucking ever.

10
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,190
365 and a wake-up.

11
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,691
Oh, Lord!

12
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,318
Xin loi, buddy.

13
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,312
Get him up here.

14
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,708
Sky Six, Ripper Six, radio
check. Over.

15
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,300
Watch it below!

16
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,326
Morehouse, drop back to slack.

17
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,170
Who's on Tail-end Charlie?

18
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,726
Eagle, Eagle, Ripper Six.
Pos rep follows.

19
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,648
I, Shackle, Lima, Whiskey,
Alpha, Whiskey, Foxtrot.

20
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,734
Warren, move Sanderson
out on flank.

21
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,154
- Say, Huffmeister!
- Yo!

22
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,990
- You got a smoke?
- No, I'm out of those!

23
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,533
Xin loi, man.

24
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,494
Bravo Two-Six.

25
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,162
What's the delay up on point?

26
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,790
You having compass
trouble again, Wolfe?

27
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,880
Come higher.

28
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,006
Shit.

29
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,144
- Get up.
- Get up.

30
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,571
Get a move on, boy.

31
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,269
Boy, what you waiting for?

32
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,312
Ain't gonna bite you.

33
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,065
That's a good gook.

34
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,608
Good and dead.

35
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,136
Cherry. Yo! Cherry!

36
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,975
Two-five-two actual. Move it out. Six says
we're jamming them up back there. Over.

37
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,352
Tell that dipshit to get unfucked.

38
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:38,231
This is Two-Five, be advised.
We're moving out shortly. Out.

39
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,276
What the hell's the matter
with you, Taylor?

40
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,570
You are one simple son of a bitch.

41
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,155
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

42
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,657
Get that other cherry
up here. Gardner.

43
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,494
- And the Doc.
- Gardner! Doc! Up!

44
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,914
Gardner and the Doc,
to the front! To the front!

45
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,167
Gardner, up.

46
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,961
Gardner, get your ass up the hill,
you fat fuck!

47
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,880
Hurry up, bubble-butt!

48
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,011
Pos rep follows.

49
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,639
I, Shackle, Lima, Whiskey,

50
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,141
Alpha, Whiskey, Foxtrot,

51
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,186
Foxtrot, Echo, Whiskey, Shackle.

52
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,607
You all right?

53
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,693
Ants. I got ants
all over my neck.

54
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,531
You got some fucking red ants.

55
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,950
Bites are killers.

56
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,160
Black ants are the worst.

57
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,621
Hurry up, lard-ass.

58
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,541
- Better lose some weight.
- Better hustle up, bacon.

59
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,084
I'm so tired!

60
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,879
Just a little.

61
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,214
Don't drink too much.

62
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:46,341
Look, I don't want you drinking
any more. All right?

63
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:47,884
I don't want you cramping up.

64
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,470
You're humping too
much stuff, troop.

65
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,764
You don't need half this shit.

66
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,725
I'll haul it for you,

67
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:59,229
but next time you check with
me first, all right?

68
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,857
Okay. Thanks, Sarge.

69
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,866
- All right, you okay?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,209
Two-Two, this is Six.

71
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,671
I understand you have a bird
inbound at your pos at this time.

72
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,594
Bravo Six, Bravo
Six, be advised.

73
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,972
Resupply helo is inbound
at this time. Over.

74
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,604
Come on, you people! Get ready.
Get that ammo off now!

75
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:48,778
Move it!

76
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,149
It ain't D-E-R-E, it's D-E-A-R.

77
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,611
And Sarah ain't got no
two "R"s, King. Damn, you dumb!

78
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,324
It don't make no difference.
She know what I mean.

79
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,952
She don't read too good nohow.

80
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,668
Look at this shit! Pork again!

81
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,504
Man, why don't you let me have that
turkey loaf for this pork shit, man?

82
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,881
Just today. I can't eat
this shit, Harold!

83
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,841
What you been smoking, Junior?

84
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,636
I hope you don't get that
laundry gig. I hope Manny get it.

85
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:57,597
'Cause your ass need
to hump, hump, and hump.

86
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:02,477
Hey, white boy, what you waiting for?
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.

87
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,063
Come on, boy. Get your
dick skin on that thing! Dig!

88
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,440
We ain't got all day! Dig! Dig!

89
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,652
Somebody once wrote,

90
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:13,363
"Hell is the impossibility
of reason."

91
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,241
That's what this place
feels like. Hell.

92
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:20,912
I hate it already, and it's only been
a week. Some goddamn week, Grandma.

93
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:26,209
The hardest thing I think I've ever done
is go on point. Three times this week.

94
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,378
I don't even know what I'm doing.

95
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:32,173
A gook could be standing three feet
in front of me, and I wouldn't know it.

96
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,717
I'm so tired.

97
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,554
We get up at 5:00 a.m.,
hump all day,

98
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:41,641
camp around 4:00 or 5:00,
dig a foxhole, eat.

99
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:45,395
Then put out an all-night ambush or a
three-man listening post in the jungle.

100
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,732
It's scary, 'cause nobody tells me
how to do anything 'cause I'm new.

101
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:52,777
Nobody cares about the new guys.
They don't even want to know your name.

102
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,572
The unwritten rule is a new
guy's life isn't worth as much,

103
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,741
'cause he hasn't put
his time in yet.

104
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,285
And they say if you're gonna
get killed in the Nam,

105
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,537
it's better to get it in
the first few weeks.

106
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,498
The logic being you
don't suffer that much.

107
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,501
If you're lucky, you get to
stay in the perimeter at night,

108
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,503
and then you pull a
three-hour guard shift.

109
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,922
So, maybe you sleep three,
four hours a night,

110
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,799
but you don't really sleep.

111
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,976
I don't think I can keep this
up for a year, Grandma.

112
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:27,854
I think I made a big
mistake coming here.

113
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,692
We've got beaucoup movement.

114
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,532
The third battalion just got hit
15 klicks north of here.

115
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,951
Charlie had claymores
strung up in the trees.

116
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:45,663
Blew a whole fucking platoon
to pieces. Bad shit.

117
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,755
Yeah, they got two lieutenants
and a captain.

118
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:54,964
Jesus.

119
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,677
All right, Sergeant,
who do you want on ambush?

120
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,472
Elias, you take your squad out.

121
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,975
Warren, you stay in,

122
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,811
but I need Tex and
Junior from your squad.

123
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,937
Roger that.

124
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,189
Okay, move out
in two-zero mikes.

125
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,982
I thought it was
O'Neill's turn tonight.

126
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:16,444
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.

127
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,655
Fu Sheng's going on
an R&R tomorrow,

128
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,032
and you want to send them out
on an ambush?

129
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,992
You got the fresh meat, buddy.

130
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,619
They don't know shit, Barnes,

131
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,704
and chances are
we're gonna run into something.

132
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:27,831
Think about it.

133
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,958
That's just great, Bob,
and what do you want me to do?

134
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,376
Send one of my guys
out to get zapped...

135
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,255
so some lame-ass just in from the
world can get his beauty sleep? No.

136
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,341
Hey, O'Neill, take a break.

137
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,094
You don't have to be a prick
every day of your life, you know.

138
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,179
Elias, get your men ready.

139
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,517
Guy's in three years, he thinks he's
Jesus fucking Christ or something.

140
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,854
O'Neill, your short-timers
stay in, but you go out.

141
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,730
I need veterans out there.

142
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,733
Sergeant Barnes.

143
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,069
Sergeant.

144
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:05,160
I think, in front of the men, it's
necessary for me to give the orders.

145
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,249
Yes, sir.

146
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,546
Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.

147
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,382
Man, it's gonna piss
on us all night.

148
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:25,221
Gonna put a serious case of crotch rot
on that your ugly face of yours, Junior.

149
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:30,018
Goddamn, man. You break your
ass for the white man.

150
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,394
No justice, right?

151
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:35,315
What's O'Neill got, a nose up
the lieutenant's ass already?

152
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,567
How come we always
get fucking ambush?

153
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,195
'Cause it's politics,
man, politics.

154
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,824
Hey, Chris, did I show you
a picture of Lucy Jean?

155
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,159
No, you didn't.

156
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,245
She's the one for me, all right,
that Lucy Jean.

157
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:52,373
- And she's waiting for me, too.
- Yeah, she's real pretty.

158
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,000
You're a lucky guy, Gardner.

159
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,586
- Hey, you got a picture
of your girl? │- No.

160
00:13:56,712 --> 00:14:00,507
I guess that leaves some unlucky
girl back at home, don't it?

161
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,884
Tuck this in.

162
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,470
Shitcan this.

163
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,265
Don't need this. Turn around.

164
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,937
Come on.

165
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,775
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor
here on your position.

166
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,652
God damn it, Elias,
don't mess with my pig.

167
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,820
I ain't getting greased
on this bush tonight,

168
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,573
so you keep this sorry
cheese-dick off my ass.

169
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,950
You got Taylor.

170
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,952
Gardner, you're with me.

171
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:33,790
Look, case anything happens to
you, you get lost or separated,

172
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,209
don't yell out, okay?
- Okay.

173
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,295
- Just sit tight, and we'll
get to you. │- All right.

174
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,798
Yo! Saddle up!

175
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,967
Lock and load!

176
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,813
Of course, Mom and Dad
didn't want me to come here.

177
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,690
They wanted me
to be just like them,

178
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:44,611
respectable, hard-working,
a little house, a family.

179
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,072
They drove me crazy with
their goddamn world, Grandma.

180
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,616
You know Mom.

181
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,704
I guess, I mean, I've always
been sheltered and special.

182
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,707
I just want to be anonymous,
like everybody else.

183
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,626
Do my share for my country.

184
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,630
Live up to what Grandpa did in the
first war, and Dad did in the second.

185
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,341
Well, here I am, anonymous,
all right.

186
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,718
With guys nobody
really cares about.

187
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,055
They come from the end
of the line, most of them,

188
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,223
small towns you never heard of.

189
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,226
Pulaski, Tennessee.
Brandon, Mississippi.

190
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,480
Pork Bend, Utah.
Wampum, Pennsylvania.

191
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,857
Two years high school's about it.

192
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,235
Maybe if they're lucky, a job
waiting for them back in a factory.

193
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,904
But most of them got nothing.

194
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,239
They're poor.
They're the unwanted.

195
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,701
Yet they're fighting
for our society and our freedom.

196
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,914
It's weird, isn't it? They're the
bottom of the barrel, and they know it.

197
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,458
Maybe that's why
they call themselves grunts,

198
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,586
'cause a grunt can take it,
can take anything.

199
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,674
They're the best I've ever seen,
Grandma. The heart and soul.

200
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,637
Hey, Taylor.

201
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,390
Hey, cheese-dick, you're up.

202
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,225
- What?
- You're up.

203
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,438
You sure you know how to work
the claymores, dude?

204
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,523
Yeah. I'm sure.

205
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,609
Flick the safety off
and bang on that sucker three times.

206
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,569
Three times. I got it.

207
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:16,119
And don't catch any "Z"s on me, buddy,
or I'll sling your sorry ass.

208
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,912
- You hear me?
- Okay.

209
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,385
Maybe I finally found it,
way down here in the mud.

210
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,388
Maybe from down here
I can start up again.

211
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,599
Be something I can be proud of
without having to fake it,

212
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,518
be a fake human being.

213
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:45,398
Maybe I can see something I don't yet
see or learn something I don't yet know.

214
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,900
I miss you.

215
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,777
I miss you very much.

216
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,238
Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris.

217
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:15,136
Junior.

218
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,512
Hey.

219
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,016
All right, motherfucker!

220
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,684
It's your shift, man!

221
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,352
Okay?

222
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,648
Here, take this.

223
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,729
Blow the fucking claymore!

224
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,690
Take the safety off! Goddamn it.

225
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,571
- Drop it!
- Take the safety off, boy!

226
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,209
Feed me, Junior!
Get over here and feed me!

227
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,512
Bravo Two, Bravo Two, we ...

228
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,392
My fucking arm! My fucking arm!

229
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,065
- Jesus fucking Christ! My arm!
- Easy, Tex! Easy, boy!

230
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,525
I'm getting you medicine.

231
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,907
Doc, over here. Gardner's hit!

232
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,326
- Be right there!
- Oh, shit.

233
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,828
I'm hit!

234
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,913
- Doc, he's hit, too.
- Taylor's hit!

235
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,581
- Taylor's hit!
- Oh, shit.

236
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,708
Doc.

237
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,002
How bad is it, Doc?

238
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,962
That dumb fuck didn't
blow his claymore!

239
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,131
Just relax, man,
it's a scratch.

240
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,632
Hold this on here.

241
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,426
Don't lie to me, Doc!
How bad is it?

242
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,679
He let them walk right up on us.
He was sleeping on his goddamn shift!

243
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,556
No, I did not.

244
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,351
Big Harold, you keep an eye on him.
You don't let him go into shock.

245
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,856
Shut up! Shut up and take
the pain! Take the pain!

246
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:50,202
Redleg, Redleg, Bravo Six.
I have NDPs at this time. Over.

247
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,218
Hey, little guy,
you're gonna be okay.

248
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,596
Okay? Don't worry.

249
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,057
Big Harold.

250
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,478
Do you know if ...
If you're gonna die?

251
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,983
Do you feel like
everything's just gonna be fine?

252
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,737
Don't give me that morbid bullshit.
We're about to get out of here.

253
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,615
They gonna give you
three hot meals a day,

254
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,575
white sheets.

255
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,869
Them pretty white nurses,

256
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,121
they gonna give you blowjobs
if you pay them enough.

257
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,956
I heard all about
them white bitches.

258
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,500
Don't baby-talk him, man!

259
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:41,504
The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them
walk right up on us and he don't do shit!

260
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,339
Just shut up, Junior.

261
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,342
You relax, okay, man?

262
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,802
Okay.

263
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,055
It's not so bad,

264
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,474
dying.

265
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:59,897
How long is...

266
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:09,115
Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there! You're gonna make it!

267
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,541
Come on, Gardner, hang in there!
You're gonna make it.

268
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,710
Come on! Don't quit!

269
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:26,006
Come on, Gardner! Help me!
Don't give up!

270
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,458
Y'all take a good look
at this lump of shit.

271
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,005
Remember what it looks like.

272
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,841
You fuck up in a firefight...

273
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,136
and I goddamn guarantee you
a trip out of the bush...

274
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,388
in a body bag!

275
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:18,517
Out here, assholes, you keep
your shit wired tight at all times!

276
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,899
And that goes for you,
shit-for-brains.

277
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,485
You don't sleep on
no fucking ambush!

278
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:34,992
And the next son of a bitch
I catch copping "Z"s in the bush,

279
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,412
I'm personally gonna take an
interest in seeing him suffer.

280
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,624
I shit you not.

281
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,753
Doc, tag him and bag him.

282
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,924
I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.

283
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,968
- It was Junior.
- Shut your face, chicken shit.

284
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,887
You in big trouble, boy.

285
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,056
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor,

286
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,224
everybody got one.

287
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,767
Knock it off!

288
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:04,688
We got two men need
attention here.

289
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,734
Police up your extra
ammo and frags.

290
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,528
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.

291
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,155
Junior,

292
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,407
Tony,

293
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,660
carry Gardner.

294
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:24,124
The man would be alive if he had
a few more days to learn something.

295
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,195
Hey, Taylor.
What's in the breeze?

296
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:57,283
- Okay, got light duty.
Three days' worth. │- No shit!

297
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,910
- Yeah. │- Well, too bad we
in base camp anyway.

298
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,370
- What you got, beers?
- Yeah.

299
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,579
Just stole me some
from the Top's supply.

300
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,706
Yeah?

301
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,332
Shit, he been stealing
it from us anyway.

302
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,544
Hey, Taylor! What, are you back?

303
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,921
Yeah, it looks like it.

304
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,882
Hey, King, where'd you
get those beers, boy?

305
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,051
- I found it.
- Oh, you found it.

306
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,720
You going on report, son, now.

307
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,264
Yeah, both of you come with me.
I got a little job for you.

308
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:27,313
Good morning, Vietnam.

309
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,023
Motherfucker!

310
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,692
This is the bright sound in the a.m.

311
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,235
Motherfucker!

312
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,115
I'm too short for this shit, man.

313
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:42,119
They always fucking with us!
No letup.

314
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,373
Politics, man. Fucking politics.

315
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,503
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far
up Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.

316
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:57,801
Thirty-nine and a wake-up, a pause for
the cause, and I'm a gone motherfucker!

317
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,971
- Back to the world!
- I hear you, man.

318
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,140
- Broke 100 the other day.
- No shit.

319
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,767
Ninety-two left to go.

320
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:09,355
April 17, heroes, man.
Home to California.

321
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:13,317
I'll be sitting outside,
checking out the babes on the beach.

322
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,444
The surfing's gonna be good.

323
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:21,241
March, man, in Tennessee.
Sniff the pines.

324
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,952
Sniff that cross-mounted pussy
down by the river.

325
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,287
Hot damn!

326
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,249
Hey, Taylor,
how long you got left?

327
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,002
- Three hundred and what?
- Thirty-two.

328
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,382
Three hundred and thirty-two days.

329
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,675
Xin loi, my boy!

330
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,137
I can't even remember
when I was 332, man.

331
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,556
You gotta, like,
count backwards or something.

332
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,266
You know, like, you got 40 days in.

333
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,144
I mean, think positive, dude.

334
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:52,731
Hey, Taylor. How in the fuck
you get here anyway?

335
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,859
- Why, you look educated.
- I volunteered for it.

336
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,361
You did what?

337
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,655
I volunteered.
I dropped out of college,

338
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:03,534
and told them I wanted the
infantry, combat, and Vietnam.

339
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,120
You volunteered for
this shit, man?

340
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,580
You believe that?

341
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,750
You's a crazy fucker,
giving up college.

342
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,587
It didn't make much sense.
I wasn't learning anything.

343
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,714
I figured why should just the
poor kids go off to war ...

344
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,842
and the rich kids always
get away with it?

345
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,845
Oh, I see. What we got
here is a crusader.

346
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,347
Sounds like it.

347
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,515
Shit.

348
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,436
You gotta be rich in the
first place to think like that.

349
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,021
Everybody know ...

350
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,734
the poor always being
fucked over by the rich.

351
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,154
Always have, always will.

352
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,495
I tell you what, if you be cool, I intro-
duce you around to some of the heads.

353
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,122
What are the heads?

354
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:51,707
Later, man.

355
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,924
What's up, brother?

356
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,473
Your highness has arrived.

357
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:08,599
Hey, what's happening?

358
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:11,602
Man, I thought you was
hanging 10 in Cambodia.

359
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,188
Come on, man.

360
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:18,066
How's it going?

361
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,906
What you doing in the
underworld, Taylor?

362
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,282
Well, this here ain't Taylor.

363
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:28,744
Taylor been shot. This man here
is Chris. He been resurrected.

364
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,254
You lame, Taylor?

365
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,924
- Am I what?
- Are you lame or something?

366
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,094
Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

367
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,524
Give it here.

368
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,943
This shit's in the wind, troop.

369
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,948
Hey, man, what's happening,
brother? Why you ...

370
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,492
You're gonna do that pot,
you better do it right.

371
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,664
You're weird, man.

372
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,417
You're a child, Lerner.
Rhah don't waste time on you.

373
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,639
- First time?
- Yeah.

374
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,520
Then the worm has definitely
turned for you, man.

375
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,189
Feel good?

376
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,650
Yeah, it feels good.

377
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,027
I got no pain in my neck now.

378
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,405
Feeling good's good enough.

379
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,334
Put your mouth on this.

380
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:23,191
Man, where the hell
is everybody, man?

381
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,027
They're getting high, that's what.

382
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:28,488
Bunch of hopheads. They think
they're something special, man.

383
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,450
Listen to that.
That's a bad jam.

384
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,537
Redneck noise, dude.
That's all it is.

385
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,956
Make about as much
sense as you do.

386
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,627
All them chucks be rapping
about how they losing they ho,

387
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:44,296
saying how they ain't got
no bread for beer.

388
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,217
Fuck that honky shit. Ought to
give me some Motown jams, dig it?

389
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,972
Man, what are you
talking shit for, man?

390
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,476
- Hey, Junior, you ever smoke
any shit? │- That's right, dude.

391
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,603
You see, y'all be trying
to keep the black man down ...

392
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,396
and string him out on that shit.

393
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:05,192
But the time be coming, my man, when
the black man throw that yoke off.

394
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:08,278
Simple. Free your mind,
your ass will follow.

395
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,905
Yeah, I can dig it, man.

396
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:13,950
You smoke that shit, everything kind
of gets weird. You know what I mean?

397
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,912
You hear that story about the gooks
putting chemicals in the grass,

398
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,581
so we don't fight,
so we become pacifists?

399
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:23,126
Hey, but don't you worry, Bunny,
'cause you's a killer anyway, man.

400
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,754
Yeah, but I still like a piece
of pussy once in a while.

401
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:29,091
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy
except maybe the Indy 500.

402
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,302
Only way you get some pussy, man,
is a bitch dies and wills it to you,

403
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,137
and then, maybe.

404
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,560
How's it going, Bunny?

405
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,522
L.T., check it out.

406
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,943
You like that?

407
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,444
Terrific.

408
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,446
I'll send it home.

409
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:53,907
Hey, Junior.

410
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,118
- Lieutenant.
- Hello, sir.

411
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:08,130
Hey, Rodriguez,
that's quite a shrine you got there.

412
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:09,589
Thank you, sir.

413
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,467
- You need anything?
- No, sir.

414
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,303
...around this flyboy's neck on
the floor of the hot, hothouse, okay?

415
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:17,305
Now wait a minute. This guy is
easily three, four times my size.

416
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,473
- Come on, man.
- No. No.

417
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:19,975
'Cause I got him in
the O'Neill death grip.

418
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,644
He didn't know whether to shit
or go blind, for Christ's sake.

419
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,397
- Hey, what do you say there, L.T.?
- How you doing there, Red?

420
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,648
Not good. Not good.

421
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,692
This cocksucker's got every card
in the deck.

422
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,026
Full house.

423
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,320
Look like you're doing all
right there, Sergeant.

424
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,656
Yeah, and I ain't
even cheating yet.

425
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,743
Hey, Lieutenant,
some Kentucky windage?

426
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,828
Thanks, Sandy.

427
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:42,789
Play, Lieutenant?

428
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,334
No. Wouldn't want to get raped
by you guys.

429
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:50,714
Why's that, Lieutenant?
What you saving up to be, Jewish?

430
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,009
Jewish.

431
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,263
I gotta run.

432
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:01,600
I'll catch you men later.
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

433
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,022
News is up in five ...

434
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:11,318
Well, that is one
sorry-ass motherfucker.

435
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,197
What do you say there, Bob?

436
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,699
A guy like that make it?
Yes or no?

437
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,787
I have to tell you,
that's precisely what I saw.

438
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,956
I mean, sometimes I just
look at a guy, and I know.

439
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,708
This fella's not gonna make it.

440
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,376
Just no fucking way.

441
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,755
- Yeah!
- I'm going now.

442
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:43,809
Come on, now!

443
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,019
l want some, now.

444
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:23,849
Yeah!

445
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:35,318
New Year's Day, 1968.

446
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,155
Just another day, staying alive.

447
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:42,033
There's been a lot of movement
near the Cambodian border.

448
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,411
Regiments of NVA moving across.

449
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,997
A lot of little
firefights, ambushes.

450
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:48,373
We drop a lot of bombs,

451
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:52,127
then we walk through the jungle
like ghosts in a landscape.

452
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,481
Bunker.

453
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,692
Where?

454
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,006
Bravo Two, Bravo Two-Five.

455
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,341
We got beaucoup bunkers up here.
Over.

456
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,346
Two-five-two, roger.
Bunkers at point.

457
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,264
Two actuals on the way.

458
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,266
Bravo Six, Bravo Six, Bravo Two.

459
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,769
Be advised.
There is a bunker complex up front.

460
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,230
Turning right on our
way down. Over.

461
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,150
See you next week.

462
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:56,084
Bravo Two. This is Alpha.
Be advised. We're at the tunnels ...

463
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,671
- I got swiped three times in my first week.
and one man down at this time. Over.

464
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:03,550
Taylor, get your ass up on
that flank about 50 meters.

465
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,969
Washington, you cover this side.

466
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,264
- Yes, sir.
- Get off your ass, Harold.

467
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,474
Bummer.

468
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:06,571
Christ. Look at that, will you?
The teapot's still boiling.

469
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,615
Man, they were just here.

470
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,620
Man, this is spooky, Sandy.
Let's get out of here.

471
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:32,031
Watch it. Watch it!

472
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:44,919
Look what we got,
Sal. We got maps.

473
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,883
We got S-2 stuff.

474
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,427
Man, this is gook stuff!
Let's get out of here!

475
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,597
No, Sal. This is important.
This is important.

476
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,520
Let's leave. Let's go.

477
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,191
Booby trap! Get down!

478
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:13,031
Medic!

479
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,577
Holy ...

480
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,260
God damn it.

481
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:39,015
We got ...

482
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:42,518
We got two men down, sir.
There was an explosion.

483
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,063
This ... We need help, sir. ASAP.

484
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:48,650
Move your ass out of here! Let's go.
One round would get all you guys out.

485
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,027
Rodriguez, move it!
Junior, let's go!

486
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,779
- Lieutenant.
- What?

487
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,032
Tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.

488
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,492
They're on their way. Now listen.

489
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,745
The NVA out of here have been spotted
in the village half a klick down the river.

490
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,622
- Now Six says we gotta
get there ASAP. │- Okay.

491
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:06,167
Also, leave four of your men
here and a medic, okay?

492
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,919
- All right.
- Move it out.

493
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,444
Pull the flanks in!
Let's move!

494
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:38,616
- Hey, where's Manny?
- Manny!

495
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,910
- Yo, Manny!
- Hey, Washington.

496
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:41,995
Manny!

497
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:44,872
- Hey, Manny!
- Manny!

498
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:46,708
- Washington!
- Yo, Manny.

499
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:48,876
Manny, where you at?

500
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:17,363
We had to get to the
village before dark.

501
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:21,284
So we left Elias with some men to keep
looking and to wait for the engineers.

502
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,996
But it was King who found him,
about 1,000 yards downriver,

503
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,789
not far from the village.

504
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:34,005
It was the end of the mystery.

505
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:06,954
The motherfuckers.

506
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:18,299
The village, which had
stood for maybe 1,000 years,

507
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:20,635
didn't know we were
coming that day.

508
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,804
If they had, they would have run.

509
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,431
Barnes was at the eye of our rage.

510
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,975
And through him, our Captain Ahab.

511
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:30,228
He would set things right again.

512
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,188
That day, we loved him.

513
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,654
There he goes, Sarge.

514
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:48,538
- Check him out.
- Yeah. You got it, Sarge.

515
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:50,832
Tubbs and Ebenhock, let's go.

516
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,504
Get that stupid look off your face!

517
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,009
Hey, piggy, piggy. Hey, pig.

518
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,269
Don't leave a hooch.
Spread out on the right!

519
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,396
Okay, watch your back!

520
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,022
Let's go!

521
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,192
What do you got here, huh?

522
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,987
Let's go! Move it! Go!

523
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,822
Get over there. Move it!

524
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:23,948
Come on! Let's go!

525
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,160
Let's go, Junior. Bring them in.

526
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,745
We have some people down here.

527
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:36,461
Get out of there,
you fuckheads! Move!

528
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:53,603
Come on!

529
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,232
Put them in the pig pen.

530
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,947
Give me your Willy Pete.

531
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,076
Shut up! Get back!

532
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,454
Fire in the hole!

533
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:25,927
Shut up! I said shut up! Shut up!

534
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,346
Get them out of here.

535
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,056
Fuck. We got one.

536
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:36,729
Get the fuck out
of the hole! Move!

537
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,482
Get the fuck out of there.
Let's go! Come on, motherfucker!

538
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,984
Be cool. Be cool. They're
scared, man. They're scared.

539
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:44,529
They're scared, huh?
What about me, man?

540
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,614
What about me?
I'm sick of this fucking shit.

541
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,824
Come on, motherfucker, move!

542
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,952
Watch this, fucker!

543
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,286
Fuckers don't want us here, man.

544
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:53,955
Who the fuck do you think
they're fighting for, huh?

545
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,039
Yeah, one more!

546
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,123
Hey! Hey!

547
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,131
Well, well.
What have we here?

548
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:11,305
One, two, three, four MAG 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.

549
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,474
We got two, four ...

550
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:19,146
Barnes, they got enough rice here
to feed a whole fucking regiment.

551
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:24,819
Sergeant Warren, you bring
that honcho over here.

552
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:28,197
Tubbs, get over here.
Junior, burn it.

553
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:31,951
What the fuck's the matter with
you? l wasn't gonna hurt you.

554
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:34,161
Look like I was gonna
fucking hurt you?

555
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:38,082
Why didn't you listen to me, huh? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?

556
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:42,545
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole.
Get the fuck up here!

557
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,631
Come here, motherfucker.
What are you smiling at?

558
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:49,802
- Why the fuck didn't you listen
to me? │- Do him, man. Do him!

559
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:53,431
What are you smiling at, huh?
You want something to smile at, huh?

560
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:54,515
You want something to smile at,
motherfucker?

561
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:58,185
Dance, motherfucker!

562
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:01,063
Do him, man! Do him!

563
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,524
Dance, motherfucker!

564
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,234
Dance! Dance!

565
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:08,696
Dance!

566
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,698
One-legged motherfucker!

567
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,832
Come on, man.
Let's go, man.

568
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,049
Fucking pussy, man.
He's laughing at you.

569
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,469
That's the way the gook laughs.

570
00:49:31,762 --> 00:49:33,262
Yeah, sure you are.

571
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,389
You're real sorry, ain't you?

572
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:39,977
You're just crying your little hearts
out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.

573
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:42,647
Forget about it,
Bunny, huh? Let's go.

574
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,149
What do you say?

575
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:09,173
Holy shit! You see that
fucking head come apart, man?

576
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,260
I never seen brains
like that before, man.

577
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:19,934
I bet you the old bitch
runs the whole fucking show, man.

578
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:22,103
She probably cut Manny's throat.

579
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,480
She'd probably cut my balls off
if she had the chance.

580
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:26,774
Bunny, we leave now.
Nobody saw a fucking thing!

581
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:27,942
- You understand me, Taylor?
- Fucking woman, man.

582
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,068
Not a fucking thing.

583
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:33,280
Come on, man, let's fucking do her, man.
Let's do this whole fucking village!

584
00:50:34,324 --> 00:50:37,535
Look at the scars on this
gook honcho, Sarge.

585
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,871
Get out of here, Tubbs.

586
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,461
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,882
Where'd he get these wounds?

588
00:50:56,972 --> 00:51:00,307
- Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
- He's a dink for sure.

589
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,562
Ask him why those weapons are here.

590
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:10,443
Says they had no choice.

591
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,361
Says the NVA killed the old
honcho when he said no.

592
00:51:12,446 --> 00:51:13,821
Now he says all the rice is theirs.

593
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:16,157
Oh, bullshit, Lerner.

594
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:19,618
Who the hell was the gook
we nailed on the riverbank?

595
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:29,879
He doesn't know. He says that the NVA
ain't been around in a couple of months.

596
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:31,881
Look, maybe he was a scout
or something, Sarge.

597
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:33,591
Yeah, sure, a scout.

598
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:37,011
What about the fucking rice and
the weapons? Who are they for?

599
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:42,516
That cocksucker knows what I'm saying!
He understands. Don't you, pop?

600
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,518
- Goddamn right he does.
- You bet.

601
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:46,312
Damn it! He's lying through
his teeth. Come on!

602
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,647
Waste the fucker,
then see who talks.

603
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,776
The boy doesn't
fucking know anything.

604
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,032
He swears he doesn't know anything.

605
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,784
He hates the NVA,
but they come when they want,

606
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:02,953
and they just take the ...
- What's the bitch saying?

607
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:05,706
I don't know. She's going on
about why'd we kill the pigs,

608
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,917
they're farmers, they got to make
a living. All that kind of shit.

609
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,126
Jesus!

610
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,889
Enough! Shut the fuck up! Enough.

611
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,917
You tell him he starts talking,
or I'm gonna waste more of them.

612
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,752
Tell him, Lerner!

613
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,386
Hey, Sarge, let us in
on this, all right?

614
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:09,270
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!

615
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:12,106
Come on, Sarge!
What the fuck are we waiting for?

616
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:17,444
Let's do them, all right?

617
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:23,534
This is his daughter,
right? Right?

618
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:35,504
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!

619
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,347
Barnes!

620
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:49,226
Barnes!

621
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:56,191
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

622
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:02,406
Stay out of this, Elias.
This ain't your show.

623
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:06,243
You ain't a firing squad,
you piece of shit.

624
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:09,163
- Get him!
- Get up, Barnes!

625
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:11,040
Elias! No, no, no!

626
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,168
Chief! Chief, tear his
fucking head off!

627
00:54:15,587 --> 00:54:17,087
Get him! Get him!

628
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:18,714
Tear him apart!

629
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:21,717
Come on, Elias!

630
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:25,095
Send him to hell!
Send him to hell, Elias!

631
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,849
Come on, boys, break it up now!

632
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:37,942
Break it up!

633
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:40,736
Come on, Elias, chill!

634
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,198
You're dead, Elias! I swear
to fucking God, you're dead!

635
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:48,452
You're going to do time!

636
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:50,996
This shit won't wash,
you fucking puke!

637
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:53,332
Break it up! Shut up!

638
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,543
Break it up! Listen up!

639
00:54:57,504 --> 00:55:00,005
The captain says to torch
this place! You hear that?

640
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,757
Torch this place!

641
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:06,303
Blow the weapons in place! Round up
all suspected VC and shake it up!

642
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:07,721
We ain't got much light left.

643
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:11,225
Lieutenant, why the fuck
didn't you do something?

644
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,143
What are you talking about?

645
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:15,771
You know what the
fuck I'm talking about!

646
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:19,942
No, I don't. I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about, Elias.

647
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:27,741
All right, move it out! Let's go!
You heard the Lieutenant! Move it out!

648
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:30,160
Taylor, let's go,
for Christ's sake!

649
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:32,329
Move it out!
Police up the weapons and let's go!

650
00:55:32,414 --> 00:55:34,206
Come on, Harold. It's cool.

651
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:22,796
Fire in the hole!

652
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,176
Hey, come on.

653
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,221
Fucker. You fucker,
get out of here!

654
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:13,472
Get the fuck off!

655
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:15,808
Don't do it! Don't do it!

656
00:57:16,226 --> 00:57:18,852
You fucker! What is this, huh?

657
00:57:23,817 --> 00:57:25,192
What are you, a homosexual, Taylor?

658
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,861
What the fuck is your problem,
Taylor? She's a fucking dink.

659
00:57:27,946 --> 00:57:30,531
She's a fucking human being, man!

660
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:33,867
- Fuck you!
- Go fuck a cherry, Taylor.

661
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:38,205
Fucking animal! All of you,
you're fucking animals!

662
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:39,915
Fucking lame fuck!

663
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,127
You don't belong in the Nam, man.
This ain't your place at all.

664
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:45,838
You don't fucking get it,
do you, man?

665
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:49,049
You just don't fucking get it.

666
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:51,260
It's okay.

667
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:56,723
Get out of there!

668
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,394
Fuck you, too, man.

669
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,898
Come on, guys. Police up your
dicks and let's get out of here.

670
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:02,414
- I didn't see anything, sir.
- I did.

671
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:05,292
That dink was reported to me
as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.

672
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:09,296
My report, sir, will include Lieutenant
Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.

673
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,048
All right, Elias.

674
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,800
- Staff Sergeant Barnes?
- Sir!

675
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:17,512
I want a full report from you on
this when we get back to the CP.

676
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:21,642
You got it, Dai-'Uy, and I can throw in
plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.

677
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,977
Not now, god damn it! Not now.

678
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:27,064
We'll get into this when we
get back to the base camp.

679
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,982
And I can promise you something.

680
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:33,612
If I find out there was an illegal
killing, there will be a court-martial.

681
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:38,158
Right now I need every man in the
field, and you two will cease fire.

682
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:42,162
Staff Sergeant Barnes,
Sergeant Elias, you hear me?

683
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:43,622
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:46,625
Now, we're going back into
that NVA bunker complex tomorrow.

685
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:48,085
This time from the East.

686
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:49,670
You people get some rest ...

687
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:52,923
and be back up here at the CP
at 19:00 for a briefing.

688
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,841
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:01,014
Come on, man.

690
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:04,518
You think these chucks
give a fuck about you and me?

691
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,647
It could just as well have been you,
Harold, you got in Barnes' way.

692
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,984
And that Bunny,
that motherfucker's crazy.

693
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,946
I mean, he scares me, man.
He just scares me.

694
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,658
Look, you bloods are getting
too hung up on all this shit.

695
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,203
These gooks are a lot smarter
than you think.

696
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,706
You know, Barnes
knows his shit, man.

697
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:28,375
They was NVA,
every last one of them.

698
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:32,713
Now, he's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way.

699
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,256
I don't know.

700
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:38,427
I mean, a Christian don't go around
a village, cutting off heads and shit.

701
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:42,014
This shit is really getting out of hand,
man. It's going way out of control.

702
01:00:42,056 --> 01:00:45,434
It seems to me that you don't
seem to know the difference,

703
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:48,437
the way you shoot up that shit
all the time.

704
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,605
I don't know, brothers,

705
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:54,401
but I'm hurting real bad inside.

706
01:00:56,696 --> 01:01:00,407
Don't worry about it, Sergeant.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.

707
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:03,785
- I mean, he's a troublemaker, but ...
- Elias is a water-walker,

708
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,913
like them politicians in Washington
trying to fight this war ...

709
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:09,624
with one hand tied
around their balls.

710
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:12,085
Ain't no need or time
for a courtroom out here.

711
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:13,754
Come on, let's go.

712
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,631
- Sarge.
- Thanks, Bun.

713
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:19,885
How'd it go there, Bob?

714
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:25,849
Yeah. Atta way, Sarge.
Fucking Elias, man.

715
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,226
He's a fucking rat,
that's what he is.

716
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:31,438
He's gonna get everybody in
this platoon in deep shit.

717
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:33,857
Somebody ought to frag his ass.

718
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:38,362
So, what do you think there, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?

719
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:39,988
Bob?

720
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:43,909
O'Neill, man,
you worry too much.

721
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:46,119
Sarge will take care of it.

722
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:53,585
It's a beautiful night.

723
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:56,129
Yeah. I love this
place at night,

724
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:58,131
the stars.

725
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,428
There's no right
or wrong in them.

726
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:05,305
They're just there.

727
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:08,225
That's a nice way of putting it.

728
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:15,440
Barnes has got it in
for you, doesn't he?

729
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:18,026
Barnes believes in
what he's doing.

730
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:21,196
And you? Do you believe?

731
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:27,160
In '65, yeah.

732
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,372
Now,

733
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,251
no.

734
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:40,549
What happened today
is just the beginning.

735
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:43,969
We're gonna lose this war.

736
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:47,722
Come on. You really think so?

737
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,849
Us?

738
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,727
We been kicking other people's
asses for so long,

739
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,480
I figure it's time
we got ours kicked.

740
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:10,704
Day by day, I struggle to maintain
not only my strength but my sanity.

741
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:14,708
It's all a blur.
I have no energy to write.

742
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:18,670
I don't know what's right
and what's wrong anymore.

743
01:03:18,713 --> 01:03:20,589
The morale of the men is low.

744
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,674
A civil war in the platoon.

745
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:25,552
Half the men with Elias,
half with Barnes.

746
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,555
There's a lot of suspicion and hate.

747
01:03:28,598 --> 01:03:33,101
I can't believe we're fighting each
other when we should be fighting them.

748
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,355
Counting days and the six inches
in front of my face.

749
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:38,940
Not much else.

750
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,693
Hope things are well, Grandma.

751
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,737
Tell Mom and Dad I ...

752
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:47,240
Well, just tell them. Chris.

753
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:13,350
Hey, big boy. I know you thought you
had that laundry gig all laid out.

754
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:17,354
Hell, I got to paint myself white
just to get me one of them fucking jobs.

755
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:19,439
It's all right. I got my request
in for a circumcision.

756
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:21,274
I'm gonna get my big ass
out of this fucker.

757
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:22,651
You gonna become a rabbi?

758
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:24,486
What you gonna do
with that little flap, boy?

759
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,737
Leech.

760
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,785
All right! Move it out!

761
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:38,458
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.

762
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,210
Yeah, I hope so.

763
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:42,045
Let's go.

764
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,669
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!

765
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,176
Sergeant Warren's hit!

766
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:35,140
What the fuck's going on?

767
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:39,185
They got RPGs man, it's an ambush! They
were just fucking waiting for us here!

768
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,479
- Who's on point?
- Lerner and Warren!

769
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:42,856
Taylor, where you going?

770
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,899
Dig! Dig! Down!

771
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:50,697
God damn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!

772
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:51,948
Right!

773
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,293
Watch out! Rockets!

774
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:13,011
Where the fuck's Lerner?

775
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:16,389
He's over there, by the log!

776
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:43,500
Fire mission.
Grid. 6-4-9-4-0-2.

777
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:46,294
Direction. 6-1-0 ...

778
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,630
Adjust fire, over.

779
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:54,094
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in
tight under the arty!

780
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,428
I spotted a cut over there.

781
01:06:55,513 --> 01:06:58,431
Let me get some men and roll up that
flank. I can work right up on them.

782
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:01,351
Get me Barnes. Look, Elias, I don't
know. We got four down up there.

783
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,144
What do you want me to do?

784
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:06,106
Where the fuck is Red platoon?

785
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,692
Tell those assholes to get up here!

786
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,944
Elias, what the fuck
are you doing back here?

787
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:12,696
Listen to me, Barnes,
there's holes back here.

788
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:16,116
Third platoon's coming up here.
We're here.

789
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:19,327
Dinks get men in these holes,
they got us caught in a crossfire.

790
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:20,745
We'll shoot each other to shit.

791
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,622
Sounds pretty far-out
to me, Elias.

792
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:25,417
I've seen it happen,
la Drang in '66.

793
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,669
They cut us to fucking pieces!

794
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,795
I need three men!

795
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:30,630
Then you got them. Take off.

796
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:33,299
You keep pouring off
that cover fire.

797
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:37,387
I don't wanna be stuck out there
with my ass hanging in the breeze.

798
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:40,348
You don't tell me
how to run my war, Elias!

799
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:44,310
Now, you go crying and rat fucking
the brigade on your own time!

800
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:47,480
But out here, you belong to me!
Now move!

801
01:07:47,523 --> 01:07:49,149
You're an asshole, Barnes!

802
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:52,068
Sergeant, get that asshole
O'Neill up here.

803
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:55,447
Two Charlie, this is Two!
Be advised...

804
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:42,744
Stay down!

805
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:50,543
- Ammo!
- Ammo!

806
01:08:50,586 --> 01:08:51,920
Be right back!

807
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:07,060
Sarge! Short round!

808
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:21,616
Medic!

809
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,591
- God!
- Medic!

810
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:48,935
Satchel charge!

811
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:53,940
Doc!

812
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,193
- Doc, help me out!
- Yeah.

813
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:01,823
Jesus!

814
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,828
- You okay?
- Don't leave me, man.

815
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:08,663
- All right.
- Don't leave me.

816
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:12,208
Hey, Gator,
you're gonna be okay, man.

817
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:13,751
Don't leave me, man.

818
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:16,754
- You'll be okay.
- Here you go, man.

819
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,797
Hang in there.

820
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,549
- Drop your rucks.
- Just hang in there.

821
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,551
Taylor, you're coming with us.

822
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:23,803
Please, don't go.

823
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:26,806
- You're gonna be okay.
- Come on!

824
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:30,143
Doc! Take care of him, man.

825
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:35,189
Redleg, Redleg,
Ripper Bravo Two actual.

826
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:38,526
Adjustment follows. Grid.

827
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,322
You ignorant asshole!

828
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,949
What the fuck coordinates
you giving?

829
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:49,120
You wasted a lot of people up there
with your fucked-up fire mission!

830
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:52,832
You know that? You know that?

831
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,542
Shit!

832
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:59,464
Redleg. Redleg. Ripper Bravo Two.

833
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:02,634
Check your fire! Check your fire!

834
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,021
They're coming.

835
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:21,945
Stagger yourself across this line.
Shoot anything that moves.

836
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:25,490
- They'll be coming from over there.
- Gotcha.

837
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:28,701
Any one of them gets through,
we are truly fucked.

838
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:31,537
Where the hell are you going?

839
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:34,457
Down by the river,
about 100 meters,

840
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,876
in case they try to flank us.

841
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:40,004
Third platoon's coming up to
our rear, so watch for them.

842
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,006
Hey. Can I go with you?

843
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:45,009
No. I move faster alone.

844
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:53,768
Come here.

845
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:56,729
Let's let arty do
a little bit of the work here.

846
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,774
We tell everybody to pull back
to the church.

847
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,819
We link up with third platoon.
You got that?

848
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,614
What about Elias?
If we pull back, he'll be cut off.

849
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:09,659
You just haul ass,
too, Lieutenant.

850
01:12:10,786 --> 01:12:11,828
I'll get him.

851
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,495
- I got two of them fuckers, man.
- I got one!

852
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,582
Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!

853
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:01,919
Crawford!

854
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,797
Oh, man!

855
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,635
- Kiss my ass. I never thought
I'd get hit. │- It's a lung, babe.

856
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:11,846
You got two of them fuckers.

857
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:13,222
Where's Elias?

858
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,308
Sarge, there's a bunch of gooks
came through there.

859
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,768
We got three of them fuckers.

860
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,687
Hey, didn't you hear the arty
shift? We're pulling back.

861
01:13:19,772 --> 01:13:22,106
Now, get your wounded man and get
the fuck back to the church.

862
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:23,149
Get going.

863
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:25,985
- But Elias is still out there, Sarge.
- Taylor, I'll get him!

864
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:29,947
You get Crawford in now, before
I article 15 both your asses. Move!

865
01:13:30,908 --> 01:13:32,158
Move it.

866
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:29,233
- All right, men. He's coming.
- Hold him down.

867
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,235
Medic, where the fuck are you?

868
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:34,447
Drag him there.

869
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:37,533
It's gonna be all right
in a minute, brother.

870
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:40,995
Taylor, where you going?

871
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:53,985
Elias is dead.
Fall back with the platoon.

872
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,946
- Get going.
- He's dead?

873
01:16:57,823 --> 01:17:00,408
Yeah. Yeah, he's back there
about 100 meters.

874
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:03,369
- You saw him? Where?
- He's dead.

875
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:06,872
And there's gooks all over
the goddamn place. Get moving.

876
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:03,512
Let's go. Move it! Move it!
Okay, let's go!

877
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:29,330
You okay, Harold?
You're on the next one.

878
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,040
You're okay, bud.

879
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:18,421
Fuck!

880
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:24,260
- They got Elias!
- What?

881
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,185
Back down! Back down there!

882
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:42,695
Snake one-niner, fly four, there's
still one on the deck down there.

883
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:45,906
Bring in the gunships, over.

884
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,598
Hold your armor! Guns! Guns!
Pull off! Pull off!

885
01:20:10,682 --> 01:20:13,225
We're trying to come around my side.

886
01:21:09,074 --> 01:21:10,574
He killed him.

887
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:14,453
I know that he killed him. l saw
his eyes when he came back in.

888
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,872
How do you know
the dinks didn't get him?

889
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:18,457
You got no proof, man.

890
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,960
Proof's in the eyes, man.
When you know, you know.

891
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:23,295
You were there, Rhah,
and I know what you were thinking.

892
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,256
I say we frag that fucker tonight.

893
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,633
I go with that. An eye for an eye.

894
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,303
I say let Military Justice
do the job on him.

895
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:35,140
Come on. Fuck the Military
Justice! Are you joking me?

896
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:36,892
Whose story you think
they're gonna believe?

897
01:21:36,977 --> 01:21:39,478
O'Neill's? Bunny's?
Wolfe's? Bullshit!

898
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,313
Shit, man, you try that ...

899
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:44,191
and Barnes will shove it right back
up your ass with a candle on it.

900
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:45,985
Well, then what do you suggest
we do, huh?

901
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:49,154
I suggest you all
watch your own asses,

902
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:51,615
because Barnes gonna be coming
down on all of them.

903
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:53,075
You just gonna forget
about Elias ...

904
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:55,244
and all the good times
we done had right in here?

905
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:59,331
Shit. You're trying to cure the
headache by cutting off the head.

906
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:02,668
Elias didn't ask you to fight
his battles for him.

907
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:06,338
If there's a heaven,
and God I hope there is,

908
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:10,050
I know he's sitting up there
drunk as a fucking monkey ...

909
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:11,719
and smoking shit,

910
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:15,097
'cause he done left
his pains down here.

911
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:16,265
You're wrong, man.

912
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,726
Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer.

913
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:19,810
Right on.

914
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:23,355
Taylor, I remember
when you first came in here ...

915
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:26,442
telling me how much you admired
the bastard.

916
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:27,526
I was wrong.

917
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:30,529
Wrong? You ain't never
been right about nothing!

918
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:34,783
And dig this, you assholes,
and dig it good ...

919
01:22:35,619 --> 01:22:38,787
Barnes been shot seven times
and he ain't dead.

920
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:41,373
Does that mean
anything to you, huh?

921
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:43,626
Barnes ain't meant to die.

922
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:47,838
The only thing that can kill
Barnes is Barnes.

923
01:22:48,882 --> 01:22:50,758
Talking about killing?

924
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:04,938
Y'all experts?

925
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:09,360
Y'all know about killing?

926
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:13,030
I'd like to hear about it, potheads.

927
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:23,415
Why do you smoke this shit?
So as to escape from reality?

928
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:28,337
Me, I don't need this shit.

929
01:23:34,761 --> 01:23:36,261
I am reality.

930
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:44,770
There's the way it ought to be.

931
01:23:44,813 --> 01:23:46,647
And there's the way it is.

932
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:52,486
Elias was full of shit.

933
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:56,156
Elias was a crusader.

934
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,618
Now, I got no fight ...

935
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:02,246
with any man who does
what he's told,

936
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:05,582
but when he don't,
the machine breaks down.

937
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:10,629
And when the machine breaks down,
we break down.

938
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:14,383
And I ain't gonna allow that ...

939
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:16,468
in any of you.

940
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:18,929
Not one.

941
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:37,239
Y'all love Elias.

942
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:44,329
Oh, you wanna kick ass.

943
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:47,750
Yeah.

944
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,839
Well, here I am,
all by my lonesome,

945
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:59,219
and ain't nobody gonna know.

946
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:07,519
Six of you boys against me.

947
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:14,943
Kill me.

948
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:34,838
I shit on all of you.

949
01:25:37,759 --> 01:25:39,426
You motherfucker!

950
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:44,890
Give it to him!
Whoop his ass. Come on.

951
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:45,974
Yes, man.

952
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:47,684
- Come on, man! Go.
- Get him!

953
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:49,478
- Oh, fuck, come on.
- Get him, Chris. Come on.

954
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,396
Come on, boy! Come on!

955
01:25:53,733 --> 01:25:56,151
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.

956
01:25:56,236 --> 01:25:58,612
You'll go dinky down in LBJ, man.

957
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:01,114
Ten years for killing
an enlisted man.

958
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:04,284
Ten years, you'll climb
the fucking walls, man.

959
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:08,038
Don't do it.

960
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:27,766
Death?

961
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:31,144
What do you all know about death?

962
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:48,453
They sent us back into
the valley the next day ...

963
01:26:48,538 --> 01:26:50,539
about 2,000 meters from Cambodia...

964
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:52,708
into a battalion perimeter.

965
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:56,295
It felt like we were returning
to the scene of a crime.

966
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:34,082
Alpha Company had been hit hard
the day before by a sizable force,

967
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:36,877
and Charlie Company had
been probed that night.

968
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:39,922
There were other battalions in the
valley. We weren't the only ones.

969
01:27:40,006 --> 01:27:43,175
But we knew we were gonna be
the bait to lure them out.

970
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:47,387
Somewhere out there
was the entire 141st NVA regiment.

971
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:07,324
Caught those motherfuckers
trying to pull some shit ...

972
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:09,660
on Charlie Company last night.

973
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:12,204
They found maps on them, man.

974
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:14,247
Got a friend at battalion,

975
01:28:14,332 --> 01:28:17,292
says they had every fucking
foxhole here fixed on it.

976
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:21,588
Distances, tree-lines, our
claymores, everything.

977
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,051
This is bad, man.
I got bad vibes here.

978
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:28,804
I also heard we're in fucking
Cambodia right now.

979
01:28:28,888 --> 01:28:31,306
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me.

980
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:34,267
You wanted to see me, sir?

981
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:39,022
Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like
you got Elias' squad now.

982
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:40,482
Squad, sir?

983
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:43,318
I didn't know we were still referring
to this platoon in terms of squads.

984
01:28:43,403 --> 01:28:44,945
All right, look.

985
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:47,948
I want you to take those two holes
right there and there.

986
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:51,243
You're tying it off with Barnes
up here, King down there.

987
01:28:51,285 --> 01:28:52,411
Yeah.

988
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,413
Begging your pardon, sir.

989
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:57,249
My two holes are far enough apart
you can run a regiment through them...

990
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:58,333
and never see them.

991
01:28:58,418 --> 01:29:00,085
I have five live bodies left, sir.

992
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:02,379
Look, I don't wanna hear
your problems, Ramucci.

993
01:29:02,422 --> 01:29:04,131
You'll get new men any day.

994
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:06,133
Meantime, you make do
like everybody else. Okay?

995
01:29:06,217 --> 01:29:08,719
- I didn't ask for this job.
- I don't want to hear it.

996
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,763
- Oh, you don't wanna hear it?
- Yeah, that's right.

997
01:29:11,806 --> 01:29:15,642
I don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell
the truth, I don't give a shit, okay?

998
01:29:15,727 --> 01:29:18,937
- I just don't give a flying
fuck anymore. │- Right.

999
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:28,030
I'm glad I ain't going with them.

1000
01:29:29,782 --> 01:29:32,868
Somewhere out there is the beast
and he hungry tonight.

1001
01:29:34,037 --> 01:29:35,871
What a fucking bummer.

1002
01:29:36,664 --> 01:29:40,000
Ten days and a wake-up, and I'm
still dealing with this shit.

1003
01:29:43,296 --> 01:29:45,297
What's the matter with you, man?

1004
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:47,966
How come you ain't writing nobody?

1005
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:50,052
What about your folks?

1006
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:53,388
That grandma you was
telling me about?

1007
01:29:55,349 --> 01:29:56,475
Girl?

1008
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:02,856
You got a mother and father,
don't you? There must be somebody.

1009
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:05,817
Nah, there's nobody.

1010
01:30:07,528 --> 01:30:10,530
You been smoking too much
of this shit, troop.

1011
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,826
Gotta control that.
Bring a man down.

1012
01:30:15,912 --> 01:30:18,121
I remember when you first come
out here, to the bush.

1013
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:19,998
You was green as a ...

1014
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:24,753
Did you ever get caught in a mistake
that you just can't get out of, King?

1015
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:27,839
There's a way out of anything, man.

1016
01:30:27,924 --> 01:30:30,926
Just keep your pecker hard
and your powder dry,

1017
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:33,345
and the world will turn.

1018
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,849
How many days you short?

1019
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,685
Nah, it's not just me.

1020
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:44,815
It's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.

1021
01:30:44,899 --> 01:30:48,860
People like Barnes just go on
making up the rules any way they want.

1022
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:52,197
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.

1023
01:30:53,533 --> 01:30:56,201
We just don't add up
to dry shit, King.

1024
01:30:56,244 --> 01:30:58,203
Whoever said we did, man?

1025
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:00,997
All you got to do is
make it out of here,

1026
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,833
and it's all gravy.

1027
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:05,710
Every day, the rest
of your life, gravy.

1028
01:31:08,923 --> 01:31:10,715
Oh, shit, superlifer.

1029
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:15,637
Hey, King, collect up your shit.
Your orders just come through.

1030
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:17,264
Now look, man. Don't fuck with me.

1031
01:31:17,348 --> 01:31:20,100
What do you need, a written
invitation, for Christ's sake?

1032
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:22,144
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!

1033
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:24,896
The lifers have made a mistake.

1034
01:31:24,981 --> 01:31:26,523
They cut me some slack, Taylor.

1035
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:28,066
Look, you get your
freight to Rodriguez.

1036
01:31:28,109 --> 01:31:30,861
You got 10 minutes to make the last
fucking chopper out of here, man,

1037
01:31:30,903 --> 01:31:33,822
'cause if you're not on it,
I'm gonna be.

1038
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:37,742
Taylor, Francis is coming up.

1039
01:31:37,827 --> 01:31:39,703
That's great, King.
I'm happy for you, man.

1040
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,496
- You take it on home
for me, okay? │- Yeah.

1041
01:31:41,581 --> 01:31:42,622
You got my address.

1042
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:45,250
You know where you can get a
hold of me anytime, right?

1043
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:48,420
I gotta beat it, man.
I don't want to miss that chopper.

1044
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,342
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1045
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:59,931
Remember now, take it easy. Don't think
too much. Don't you be no fool.

1046
01:32:00,308 --> 01:32:04,144
Remember, ain't no such thing as
a coward out here. Don't mean nothing.

1047
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:05,604
My man.

1048
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:15,238
I'll walk you out, man.

1049
01:32:20,203 --> 01:32:21,411
Take it easy, King.

1050
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:23,246
I'm gonna take it any way
I can get it, brother.

1051
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:24,956
I hear you. Later.

1052
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:27,292
I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge!

1053
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:28,793
Oh, man! Don't touch that.

1054
01:32:28,878 --> 01:32:30,545
I got to get on a chopper, man.

1055
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,172
So what's the problem?

1056
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:33,965
Says he can't walk.

1057
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:35,675
Shit.

1058
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,888
Martin, get your boots on.

1059
01:32:43,643 --> 01:32:48,104
And the next time I catch you spraying
skeeter repellent on your fucking feet,

1060
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:50,649
I'm gonna court-martial
your nigger ass.

1061
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:53,818
Well, then court-martial me,
motherfucker!

1062
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:56,655
Bust my ass.
Send me to fucking Long Binh!

1063
01:32:57,323 --> 01:32:59,115
You do your fucking worst!

1064
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:02,619
You white folks have got
your last klick out of Junior!

1065
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:07,040
- O'Neill, get me that centipede.
- Sergeant?

1066
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:10,877
Yeah, that long, hairy,
red and black bastard ...

1067
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:12,963
I found in the ammo crate.

1068
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:17,008
I'm gonna put it in this boy's
crotch, see if he can walk.

1069
01:33:17,093 --> 01:33:18,718
I remember now.

1070
01:33:18,928 --> 01:33:21,137
Hey. Now hold up, man!

1071
01:33:21,472 --> 01:33:23,473
You just hold up and
wait, all right?

1072
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:26,268
Fuck it! I'll walk!
I'll fucking walk, man!

1073
01:33:26,352 --> 01:33:29,437
Fucking pussy, man. Hey, Sarge,
I got to have him in my hole?

1074
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:30,647
Yeah.

1075
01:33:30,982 --> 01:33:33,692
Bob, I'd like to speak
to you a minute.

1076
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:40,365
I can't take it no more.

1077
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,828
- I'd like to speak to you, Bob.
- Yeah, what is it?

1078
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:48,748
Bob, I got Elias' R&R. It's
coming up in three days, here.

1079
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:51,876
I was thinking about going
to Hawaii, maybe see Patsy.

1080
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:54,504
Hey, Bob, come on, I never asked
you for a fucking thing over here.

1081
01:33:54,547 --> 01:33:56,715
You know, I was thinking maybe ...
Well, to be honest with you,

1082
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:58,883
I was hoping you'd put me on that
chopper with King out of here.

1083
01:33:58,968 --> 01:34:01,052
What do you say,
chief-a-rooney?

1084
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:02,554
I can't do that for you, Red.

1085
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:05,056
We need every swinging dick
in the field, and you know that.

1086
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:07,267
Hey, Bob, come on. You can talk
to me, for Christ's sake.

1087
01:34:07,351 --> 01:34:09,436
All I'm asking for is three
fucking days, here.

1088
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,647
I am talking to you, Red,
and I'm telling you "no."

1089
01:34:12,815 --> 01:34:15,025
So get back in your foxhole.

1090
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:18,236
Bob, I got a bad feeling
on this one, all right?

1091
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:21,489
I mean, I got a bad feeling.

1092
01:34:22,283 --> 01:34:24,659
I don't think I'm gonna
make it out of here.

1093
01:34:24,744 --> 01:34:27,370
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

1094
01:34:27,913 --> 01:34:30,415
Everybody got to
die sometime, Red.

1095
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:40,258
Oh, shit.

1096
01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:56,900
Goodbye, motherfuckers!

1097
01:35:09,372 --> 01:35:11,414
Where's that fucking ambush?

1098
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:16,002
They ain't even waiting till later.
It's fucking coming now, man.

1099
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:18,588
Right fucking now.

1100
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:26,805
You know, Junior,
some of the things we done, man ...

1101
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:30,475
I don't feel like we done
something wrong.

1102
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:32,310
But sometimes, man,

1103
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:36,231
I get this bad feeling.

1104
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,820
I told the Padre the truth, man.
I like it here.

1105
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:45,073
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.

1106
01:35:45,157 --> 01:35:47,492
The only worry you got is dying.

1107
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:50,370
And if that happens,
you won't know about it anyway.

1108
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,288
So what the fuck, man.

1109
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:56,167
Shit, I got to be in this hole
with you, man?

1110
01:35:56,502 --> 01:35:58,878
I just know I shouldn't have come.

1111
01:36:00,923 --> 01:36:02,340
Don't you worry, Junior.

1112
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:05,427
You're hanging with
Audie Murphy here, my man.

1113
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:11,015
Bravo Three, Bravo Three, Bravo Six,
send me a grid. Send me a grid. Over.

1114
01:36:12,309 --> 01:36:14,269
Can't, sir. Pinned down.
They're in the fucking trees.

1115
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:16,646
Okay, Three Alpha,
now calm down, son.

1116
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:19,524
I'll get you a fire mission ASAP.
Smoke will be first.

1117
01:36:19,567 --> 01:36:21,651
Lieutenant's dead.
Radioman looks dead, sir.

1118
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:23,194
I don't know where
the map is, Captain!

1119
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:25,488
They're all around us, sir,
hundreds of them!

1120
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:27,574
I can hear them talking gook.

1121
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:30,743
Okay, Three Alpha. Now spot that
smoke, and tell me where to shift.

1122
01:36:30,828 --> 01:36:33,621
Just calm down, son. Hang in
there. We'll get you out.

1123
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:36,416
Just tell me where
the rounds hit. Over.

1124
01:36:52,892 --> 01:36:54,934
Three Alpha Six.
How about those rounds, son?

1125
01:36:55,019 --> 01:36:57,061
Can you adjust fire? Over.

1126
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:02,108
Three Alpha Six.

1127
01:37:02,193 --> 01:37:05,862
If you can't talk, son, just
key your handset twice. Over.

1128
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:21,794
Shit.

1129
01:38:06,674 --> 01:38:08,883
Trip flare! Rodriguez's hole!

1130
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,473
RPG!

1131
01:38:18,102 --> 01:38:19,561
Doc, Doc!

1132
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:21,229
Taylor, Francis.

1133
01:38:21,397 --> 01:38:22,939
Over here, man.

1134
01:38:23,607 --> 01:38:27,235
What the fuck's going on?
Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man!

1135
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:30,071
Gooks, man. We got gooks
in the fucking perimeter.

1136
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:31,739
Oh, shit! That's it.

1137
01:38:31,824 --> 01:38:33,491
They got through Alpha Company.

1138
01:38:33,576 --> 01:38:36,953
Anything behind you don't identify
itself, fucking blow it away, okay?

1139
01:38:36,996 --> 01:38:41,499
Fuck! Two, air strike's coming in.
They're gonna be laying snake and nape.

1140
01:38:41,584 --> 01:38:44,502
Don't get out of your fucking hole.
Stay right here, man.

1141
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,920
Fuck.

1142
01:38:52,094 --> 01:38:53,303
They're probing us.

1143
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:56,014
They're gonna be going up and down this
line all night trying to get through.

1144
01:38:56,098 --> 01:38:59,350
All right. Stay here. Stay cool.
I'll be right back.

1145
01:38:59,476 --> 01:39:03,896
Whiskey, Foxtrot, Foxtrot,
Echo, Whiskey. Over.

1146
01:39:19,455 --> 01:39:20,955
Who is it?

1147
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:25,376
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1148
01:39:30,716 --> 01:39:33,384
It's the ambush.
Over here, man. Hurry.

1149
01:39:37,181 --> 01:39:38,431
Fuck it up.

1150
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,224
Shit. Quiet.

1151
01:39:40,267 --> 01:39:43,936
They're all over the place.
Hundreds of them, moving this way!

1152
01:39:45,397 --> 01:39:48,024
They wiped us out, man!
We didn't have a chance!

1153
01:39:48,067 --> 01:39:49,984
- Where's the CP?
- Back there.

1154
01:39:50,069 --> 01:39:52,362
You guys, get out of here!
They're right on my ass!

1155
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:54,614
They ain't stopping for shit!

1156
01:39:56,742 --> 01:39:58,910
Hey, Taylor, man, let's didi.

1157
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:00,620
You go.

1158
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,047
There!

1159
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,584
No. Hold it. Hold it.

1160
01:41:05,227 --> 01:41:07,103
Out of the hole! Fast!

1161
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,358
Get out of the fucking hole!
They're gonna blow it!

1162
01:41:12,443 --> 01:41:17,155
Let's go! Let's go!
Francis, move your fucking ass!

1163
01:41:17,197 --> 01:41:19,198
They're gonna fucking ...

1164
01:41:39,428 --> 01:41:41,012
- Follow me.
- Wait.

1165
01:41:56,236 --> 01:41:58,446
Die, you motherfuckers!

1166
01:42:07,831 --> 01:42:09,081
Get back!

1167
01:42:11,043 --> 01:42:13,211
It's fucking beautiful!

1168
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:16,964
- Let's fucking do it!
- Where are you going?

1169
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,307
- All right!
- Now come on, motherfuckers!

1170
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:33,397
Come on. You can
do better than that!

1171
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,818
They just keep coming, man!
Fuck this shit!

1172
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:40,988
Get back here, you gutless shit!

1173
01:43:40,048 --> 01:43:41,507
All right. Get me Bravo.
Right away.

1174
01:43:41,592 --> 01:43:43,426
Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand
on perimeter, sir.

1175
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:45,428
Three holes are down.
They need help.

1176
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:48,806
Okay. Get two squads from Alpha
down there right away. Go. Go.

1177
01:43:48,849 --> 01:43:50,892
Where's that goddamn air strike?

1178
01:43:52,352 --> 01:43:55,062
Hey, scumbag,
where the fuck you going?

1179
01:44:02,779 --> 01:44:04,155
Eagle Six ...

1180
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:11,412
Son of a bitch.

1181
01:44:13,957 --> 01:44:15,124
Can't you get anybody?

1182
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:17,251
Damn it! Negative contact!
Can't raise Barnes.

1183
01:44:17,336 --> 01:44:18,920
Two Bravo, Two Charlie, nothing.

1184
01:44:19,004 --> 01:44:20,004
Get me Six!

1185
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:22,673
Bravo Six! Bravo Six! Oh, God!

1186
01:44:24,009 --> 01:44:25,343
Get him in!

1187
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,766
They're coming through all over!
I can't do anything!

1188
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,017
Where's Barnes?

1189
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,102
Shit, he's dead!
I think they're all dead.

1190
01:44:35,187 --> 01:44:38,439
Doc, he's dead. Six, LT, Six.

1191
01:44:38,732 --> 01:44:42,109
Captain. Captain, we've been overrun.
We're pulling back! Over.

1192
01:44:42,194 --> 01:44:45,321
God damn it, Lieutenant.
Where are you gonna pull back to?

1193
01:44:45,364 --> 01:44:47,365
They're all over the perimeter.

1194
01:44:47,407 --> 01:44:51,494
Now you be advised. You will
hold in place, and you will fight.

1195
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:54,288
That means you, Lieutenant.
Bravo Six out.

1196
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:26,654
Be advised. We've got zips
in the wire down here.

1197
01:45:26,738 --> 01:45:29,740
Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.

1198
01:45:29,783 --> 01:45:33,911
We're hot to trot and packing snake
and nape but we're bingo on fuel.

1199
01:45:33,954 --> 01:45:36,038
For the record, it's my call.

1200
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:38,874
Dump everything you've got left
on my pos.

1201
01:45:38,917 --> 01:45:43,254
l say again, expend all
remaining in my perimeter.

1202
01:45:43,797 --> 01:45:46,632
It's a lovely fucking war.
Bravo Six out.

1203
01:45:49,011 --> 01:45:52,430
Roger your last, Bravo Six.
We copy. It's your call.

1204
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:55,766
Get them in their holes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.

1205
01:45:55,809 --> 01:45:58,269
We're coming cocked for treetops.

1206
01:46:22,252 --> 01:46:27,631
Barnes!

1207
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:33,304
No!

1208
01:49:23,391 --> 01:49:24,892
Get me a medic.

1209
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:29,146
Go on, boy!

1210
01:49:47,332 --> 01:49:48,499
Do it.

1211
01:50:20,198 --> 01:50:23,117
We got men wounded
and live gooks at 3 o'clock.

1212
01:50:23,868 --> 01:50:26,245
Look down here.
Check them out.

1213
01:50:27,831 --> 01:50:30,624
Come on, Elmo.
Move your flea-bitten ass!

1214
01:50:34,379 --> 01:50:37,965
Hey, you okay? You all right?

1215
01:50:38,341 --> 01:50:40,384
Can you walk, huh?

1216
01:50:41,511 --> 01:50:45,764
Hey, Doc, we need a medic up here.
Come on, Elmo.

1217
01:50:45,849 --> 01:50:48,267
Come on, Doc, we got wounded here.

1218
01:51:07,203 --> 01:51:09,913
Yeah. That must have
been some fucking fight.

1219
01:51:11,124 --> 01:51:12,666
You alone here, man?

1220
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:14,752
Yeah.

1221
01:51:15,628 --> 01:51:18,756
The bunch of fucking faggots,
they all left me.

1222
01:52:07,347 --> 01:52:11,141
122 wounded and still counting.

1223
01:52:11,184 --> 01:52:14,478
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA.

1224
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:17,648
122 and still counting. Over.

1225
01:52:24,155 --> 01:52:27,491
- Hey, Taylor, that you?
- Hey, Francis.

1226
01:52:27,534 --> 01:52:30,744
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- I'm okay. How you doing?

1227
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:32,996
Fine, man. Just fine. Hey, dig it.

1228
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:35,666
We two timers, man.
We're gonna get out of here, boy.

1229
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:39,920
I'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.

1230
01:52:40,004 --> 01:52:41,630
Sergeant O'Neill.

1231
01:52:42,966 --> 01:52:45,092
- How you doing?
- Well, I'm just fine, sir.

1232
01:52:45,176 --> 01:52:48,345
Well, that's good.
'Cause you got second platoon.

1233
01:52:48,721 --> 01:52:50,013
Yes, sir.

1234
01:53:00,108 --> 01:53:01,859
- You ready?
- You bet.

1235
01:54:30,907 --> 01:54:33,617
l think now, looking back,

1236
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:38,580
we did not fight the enemy.
We fought ourselves.

1237
01:54:38,748 --> 01:54:41,291
And the enemy was in us.

1238
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:45,462
The war is over for me now,

1239
01:54:45,672 --> 01:54:49,341
but it will always be there
the rest of my days...

1240
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:52,302
as I'm sure Elias will be,

1241
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:56,640
fighting with Barnes for what Rhah
called possession of my soul.

1242
01:54:58,476 --> 01:55:00,102
There are times since,

1243
01:55:00,144 --> 01:55:03,772
I've felt like the child
born of those two fathers.

1244
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:08,819
But, be that as it may,

1245
01:55:09,028 --> 01:55:10,821
those of us who did make it...

1246
01:55:10,863 --> 01:55:13,240
have an obligation to build again,

1247
01:55:13,866 --> 01:55:16,159
to teach to others what we know,

1248
01:55:17,161 --> 01:55:19,871
and to try with
what's left of our lives...

1249
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:23,500
to find a goodness and meaning
to this life.
