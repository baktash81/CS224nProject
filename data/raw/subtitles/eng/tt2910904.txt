1
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,807
I'm back, you bastards.

2
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,290
Is that, uh...

3
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
Dior?

4
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,245
Very good, Sergeant Farrat.
My design, but Dior-inspired.

5
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,845
Myrtle Dunnage.

6
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,047
Tilly.

7
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,441
- You grew up.
- You got old.

8
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,331
Sad, but true.

9
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,369
What have I done this time?

10
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,329
Fine leather...

11
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,202
can be irreparably damaged
by moisture and mildew,

12
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,805
Tilly.

13
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,771
How's my mother?

14
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,567
Molly... doesn't get out much these days.

15
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,005
Did anyone... know you were coming?

16
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,330
They'll know soon enough.

17
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,125
Mum?

18
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,846
Oh!

19
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,482
Have you come about the possum?

20
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,965
You can't have him.

21
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,361
Because we wanna keep him, don't we?

22
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,564
Do you remember Miss Harridene?

23
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,125
The schoolteacher?

24
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,207
Stewart Pettyman.

25
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,491
Do you remember him?

26
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,291
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

27
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,124
He was Miss Harridene's favourite.

28
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,681
Miss Harridene, she stained me.

29
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,888
- She stained me with the ink!
- Huh?

30
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,482
What about Mr Almanac?

31
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,880
The chemist?

32
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,930
I don't even know who you are.

33
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,249
Hmm. Hmm.

34
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,363
Hmm.

35
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,921
Sinners...

36
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,566
Ah!

37
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,441
We both remember Mr Almanac.

38
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,686
Apply three times daily.

39
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,241
Thank you, Mr Almanac. Come on, Myrtle.

40
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,363
Your mother's a slut and you're a bastard.

41
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,124
What about Shire President Pettyman?

42
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,006
Hmm?

43
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,127
Now, there's a reason to vote.

44
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,161
Oh!

45
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,565
I don't know why
you've come to this... hole.

46
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,881
There's nothing here.

47
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,650
I came because...

48
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,082
I need you to remember me, Mum.

49
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,287
Mum?

50
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,011
I need you to remember so I can remember.

51
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,563
Remember what? Being my daughter? Hmph.

52
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,609
- That too.
- Fat chance.

53
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,325
What else?

54
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,008
Did I commit a murder?

55
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,641
What?

56
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,449
Am I a murderer?

57
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,845
Is that why I'm cursed?

58
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,082
You don't remember committing a murder?

59
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,129
No.

60
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,328
Well...

61
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,849
it's not something
you're likely to forget.

62
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,161
I know.

63
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,164
What if you are a murderer?

64
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,286
I wouldn't be in the least surprised.

65
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,041
- Murder!
- Stop it! Come on.

66
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,929
- Murder!
- Oh! Ah! Ooh!

67
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,050
- Help! Help!
- Don't... Oh!

68
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,685
Ah!

69
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,046
Oh, oh!

70
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,605
Murder!

71
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,125
- Molly!
- Oh!

72
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,610
Help! Help!

73
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
Ah! Ah!

74
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,527
Murder! Ah!

75
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,966
- Let me go, you bitch.
- No, no, no. No! No!

76
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,645
You've got to...

77
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,002
Molly, stop it!

78
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,401
It's just a bath.

79
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,046
You're filthy dirty and you stink, Mum!

80
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,731
Rape!

81
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,041
- Stop, stop...
- Rape!

82
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
Who in their right mind would be
up there raping Mad Molly?

83
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,569
A lady with little balls!

84
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,326
Knew there was a reasonable
explanation, Barney.

85
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,321
Myrtle Dunnage is back.

86
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,608
Haven't seen her since she was a kid.

87
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,125
She moved.

88
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,291
They sent her away, Barney...
for the good of us all.

89
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,090
Dunnybum's come home.

90
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,043
Wonder how she turned out.

I know you're in there!

101
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,285
My geraniums have been assaulted!

102
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,165
Morning, Beulah.

103
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,242
I'm sure I saw that half-finished one,

104
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,526
Barney McSwiney,

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,768
peering at me from on the top of the silo.

106
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,521
Ah. There's Elsbeth Beaumont.

107
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,081
Young William's back
from West Australia, I see.

108
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,765
My son.

109
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,530
Home at last.

110
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,808
Ready to embrace your future!

111
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,605
There's Mrs A.

112
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,726
Ah.

113
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,291
Yoo-hoo, Mrs Almanac.

114
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,488
Oh! Ooh!

115
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,889
Can't you help her with some
of them drugs of yours, Mr A?

116
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,087
Addictive!

117
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,086
All she needs is God's forgiveness
and a wholesome diet.

118
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,089
Oh!

119
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,848
What?

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,082
Prudence, Mr Almanac's coming.

121
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,890
Ah! She won't get me!

122
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,205
Whoa there! Gotcha.

123
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,964

It's William!

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,285
Pratt's. Hasn't changed.

129
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,091

I call Reggie the Perry Como of Dungatar.

136
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,042
But much better-looking, don't you think?

137
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,370
William's back.

138
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,329
It's nice to see you home, William.

139
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,891
What? Oh.

140
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,530
Excuse us, Gert.

141
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,483
I was... only after some coils
of fencing wire, Mr Pratt.

142
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,321
I have your mother's unpaid accounts
of the last two years.

143
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,168
Comes to a total of £347,

144
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,290
10 shillings and 8 pence.

145
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,484
William's travelled.
He's very worldly these days.

146
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,369
Does he have a lady friend?

147
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,081
Well, our Gert's a handsome, capable girl.

148
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,442
She knows feedstock, haberdashery...

149
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,487
Mother!

150
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,041
...and what powders are lethal
to maggots and fly-struck merinos!

151
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,361
I'm afraid...

152
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,568
William will have to look
much further than here

153
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,122
for suitable... companionship.

154
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,165
Who lives at Mad Molly's now?

155
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,931
Mad Molly. Only she's dead.

156
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,121
Someone's alive, Mother.

157
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,730
They've lit a fire.

158
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,970
- She's back!
- Jesus!

159
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,281
The murderess is back!

160
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,761
Hmm.

161
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,044
Irma, the cushion!

162
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,009
You're off the paper!

163
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,640
Evan, you're off the paper!

164
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,009
It's going to rain tomorrow.

165
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,322
Windows will need cleaning when it stops.

166
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,325
The latches and the doorknobs
need a good soaking as well.

167
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,561
Pet...

168
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,164
A situation has developed,

169
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,085
and until it's settled, I don't
want you leaving the house.

170
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,200
What things? What situation?

171
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,407
Well...

172
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,409
it's the grand final this weekend.

173
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,523
Footballers from Winyerp will be coming

174
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,968
with their filthy boots
and their foul language.

175
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,531
Not coming into my house?

176
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,842
No, no, no. In the street.

177
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,368
You will be safe inside.

178
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,048
Now, my pet, have your tonic.

179
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,806
- Oh...
- Good girl.

180
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,610
Give you a little bit extra so you...

181
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,565
- There we go.
- Thank you.

182
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,887
There you go, pet. Head on the pillow.

183
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,010
I can't see him.

184
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,004
25 years since Stewart's accident.

185
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,643
25 years since I lost my boy.

186
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,805
Pet?

187
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,561
Pet?

188
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,971
Go, Teddy!

189
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,164
On your left, Teddy!

190
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,448
- Go, Reggie!
- Move over, boy!

191
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,084
Oof!

192
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,004
Oh! Oh! Reggie!

193
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,286
Pick it up, Teddy!

194
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,091
- Go, Teddy!
- Go, Teddy!

195
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,446
On ya, Teddy!

196
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,091
Go, Teddy!

197
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,046
Who's that?

198
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,769
Outside, outside, outside.

199
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,887
Oof!

200
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,087
Ah!

201
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
Don't look at her. Eyes on the ball.

202
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,446
Stop looking at her, boys! Come on!

203
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,090
Farrat, stop her. Charge her.

204
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,005
With what? Sitting?

205
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,764
The nerve of that girl!

206
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,164
Goal.

207
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,650
- G'day.
- Oh.

208
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,007
Your get-up's distracting my players.

209
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,686
Well, I do have an unusual talent
for bias cutting.

210
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,962
- Yeah. Listen, Myrtle...
- I prefer Tilly.

211
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,963
Tilly, the only reason

212
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,930
these bastards haven't run
us McSwineys out of town too

213
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,844
is me dad empties their shithouses

214
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,729
and I win 'em the footy.

215
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,930
We lose this match,
all I've got left is the shit.

216
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,127
Thank you, Teddy.

217
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,682
I know you and Mae have been
looking out for Molly.

218
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,765
You leaving?

219
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,486
No. I'm going to change.

220
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,528
Been looking out for me, have you?

221
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,411
Iced VoVo?

222
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,403
No, thank you, Molly.

223
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,204
I remember you. It's Molly Dunnage.

224
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,609
That's right. I'm still alive!

225
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,762
What about that poor wife of yours?

226
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Irma is as well as can be expected.

227
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,291
Mmm.

228
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,410
She kept running into doors,
if I remember, your wife.

229
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,165
Cut lips, black eyes...

230
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,685
Can I help you?

231
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,129
That all miraculously went away
when you become a hunchback.

232
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,123
Tilly...

233
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,964
I heard she was back.

234
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,770
I had no idea she was so beautiful.

235
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,046
Gertrude knows fruit preservatives.

236
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,690
Female intimate apparel.

237
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,403
She does her own hair too.

238
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,925
Oh...

239
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,128
Your dress...

240
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,084
That fabric...

241
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,362
That's the photographer
from the Winyerp Gazette.

242
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,249
How about a kiss for our man in blue, hey?

243
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,368
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

244
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,681
Kiss me, kiss me.

245
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,326
Eugh! Trollop!

246
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,167
Problem with your Dungatar team
is inexperience.

247
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,521
See, our Winyerp boys
are seasoned professionals.

248
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,008
They're not likely to be distracted
by some good-looking sheila.

249
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,247
Oh.

250
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,050
Gertrude Pratt.

251
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,650
What's the matter with you?

252
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,321
I hear the footballers' dance
is Saturday night.

253
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,448
I could make you something.

254
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,602
A dress can't change anything.

255
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,207
Watch and learn, Gert.

256
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,930
Watch and learn.

257
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,050
Oh, how fortunate.
It's three-quarter time.

258
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,370
Changeover.

259
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,009
Oh, come on! Concentrate, Dungatar!

260
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,286
- Ah!
- Oh!

261
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,768
That's it. Keep falling over.

262
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,203
Come on, Winyerp! Lift your game!

263
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,647
Come on. Come on, wake up!

264
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,045
Ooh!

265
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,961
You bloody idiot!

266
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,970
Genius.

267
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,370
Come on, don't look at her.
Eyes on the ball.

268
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,521
Oh!

269
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,765
Oh!

270
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,720
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

271
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,405
Dungatar win!

272
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,767
Dungatar!

273
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,050
Dungatar!

274
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,042
Your husband's mighty slow
these days, Irma Almanac.

275
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,440
How'd you manage that?

276
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,841
Oh, Molly Dunnage. Oh!

277
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,321
And you're in a wheelchair too.

278
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,164
Yeah, well, it suits my captor.

279
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,526
Oh!

280
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,765
- Ooh.
- Ooh. Still hurts, does it?

281
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,041
Mmm.

282
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,851
Uh, Mrs Almanac, my name is Tilly...

283
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,002
I know who you are, Myrtle.

284
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,322
It's very good of you to come home.

285
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,847
It's very brave too.

286
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,889
Sergeant Farrat told me you've been
sending food to Molly all these years.

287
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,010
Don't mention it.
Please, don't mention it.

288
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,810
Made you some special cakes.

289
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,610
Oh, speaking of poison.

290
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,291
Mmm.

291
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,010
Unusual aroma.

292
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,281
Mmm!

293
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,886
Mmm!

294
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,048
And tell me...

295
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,171
why would a beautiful and clever girl
like you come back here?

296
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,805
Excuse me.

297
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,001
Quick, Irma... who is she,
and who did she murder?

298
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,725
You don't remember
any of it at all, Molly?

299
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,530
Uh... She doesn't even remember.

300
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,886
Well...

301
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,085
They say that she killed a boy, Molly.

302
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,724
I remember Evan Pettyman
bundling her into the police car...

303
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,480
and then Sergeant Farrat driving her away.

304
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,722
Hey, watch out!

305
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,683
Get it, Dunnybum. Get it!

306
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,443
She threw it on the roof, Stewart!

307
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,443
Dunnybum threw your ball on the roof!

308
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,568
Get Dunnybum! Get her!

309
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,720
Look over there!

310
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,131
You too!

311
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,725
Can't find her anywhere.

312
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,723
She's gotta be here somewhere! Find her!

313
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,127
Gert. Gertrude!

314
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,970
Please help me. Please.

315
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,920
Gert...

316
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,524
Gert, please. Gert, please help me.

317
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,849
Miss Harridene!

318
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,971
Miss Harridene!

319
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,327
Miss Harridene!

320
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,920
Miss Harridene!

321
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,687
Help!

322
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,083
Stand really, really still, Dunnybum.

323
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,129
Or I'll come round to your house tonight

324
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,124
and kill your mother, the slut.

325
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,523
And when she's dead, I'll get...

326
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,801
...you.

327
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,411
Oh...

328
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,450
Oh, Molly, there's... there's no pain.

329
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,969
There... there... there's no pain at all.

330
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,081
Oh!

331
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,720
<i>♪ I traded my heart for your heartbeat</i>

332
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,450
<i>♪ And gave you all of this to boot</i>

333
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,206
<i>♪ If you feel you want to make a deal</i>

334
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,045
<i>♪ Cock your piece and rooty-toot-toot</i>

335
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,009
<i>♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang... ♪</i>

336
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,364
You know, I lost a child too, Molly.

337
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,851
Your first victim, was it?

338
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,528
There's nothing more terrible
than losing a child.

339
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,047
It's enough to send you mad.

340
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,844
Wouldn't know. I never had any myself.

341
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,963
Who's this?

342
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,291
Where did you get that?

343
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,841
That's Madame Vionnet.

344
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,641
- Mm-hm.
- I used to work for her in France.

345
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,926
She probably died too.

346
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,368
No, she's... she's still alive.

347
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,091
- Hmph.
- She's an old lady now.

348
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,683
A designer. She recommended me
to Balenciaga.

349
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,729
- Another victim.
- Another designer.

350
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,086
Maybe.

351
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,091
Did she teach you how to sew?

352
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,288
No, you taught me to sew!

353
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,250
I can't sew.

354
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,888
I know you remember me, Mum!

355
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,405
Come on, just...

356
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,329
say my name.

357
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,648
Go on. Say it! Say my name.

358
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,404
You won't get me, you murderous bitch!

359
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,767
Oh! Oh! No.

360
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,969
Say my name! Say it! Say it!

361
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,726
Oh! Oh!

362
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,962
Stewart Pettyman!

363
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,602
That's right.

364
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,047
You killed a boy. Broke his neck.

365
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,650
So now you know you are a murderer,
you are cursed, so fuck off!

366
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,567
Am I, uh... interrupting?

367
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,364
Not at all.

368
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,527
No. Just taking a trip down
memory lane with Lizzy Borden here.

369
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,366
Uh... I want this one.

370
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,047
You'll get what I give you.

371
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,361
Oh!

372
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,010
Come in.

373
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,645
Gah!

374
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,445
15 shillings.

375
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,921
That's... that's outrageous.

376
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,525
So's your bum.

377
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,569
You know how to bargain, Gertrude.

378
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,285
Free groceries for a week.

379
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,528
Information.

380
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,886
Like what?

381
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,766
Did you tell Stewart Pettyman
where I was hiding that day?

382
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,643
What day?

383
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,882
You know exactly what day.

384
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,686
Gertrude...

385
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,487
I can make you
the most striking girl in the room.

386
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,361
I told.

387
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,490
Sorry, Myrtle, but I figured
it was better you than me.

388
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,003
Does... does that mean our deal's off?

389
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,441
Take your clothes off.

390
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,846
A murderer and a lesbian.

391
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,086
This one.

392
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,402
Open that one.

393
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,483
Oh, Teddy!

394
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,483
Ooh!

395
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:58,369
McSwiney! I got five quid that says
that you are too gutless!

396
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,164
Five quid.

397
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,800
Don't be scared. They're only mice, mate.

398
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,167
They just wanna say hi.

399
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,771
Five quid? Easy money!

400
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,600
Come on, Barney.

401
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,171
Are you a man or a mouse, McSwiney?

402
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,771
- Come on, Teddy.
- What do you reckon, Barney?

403
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,445
- Should I jump?
- Jump, Teddy!

404
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,602
- Jump, jump, jump, jump!
- Look out for the mice.

405
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,171
Are you too scared, mate?

406
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,403
Come on, Teddy! Come on, Teddy!

407
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,449
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

408
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,329
Arggh!

409
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,448
Yeah!

410
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,090
Hey!

411
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,210
On your back, McSwiney! On your back!

412
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,681
Whoa!

413
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,411
Look out below!
Reggie Blood coming through!

414
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,170
Whoo!

415
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,245
Come on down, boys!

416
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,804
I don't know why you want this mirror.

417
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,650
It's filthy.

418
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,401
Got a clean one of those
at home if you want it.

419
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,164
Need a lift?

420
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,084
Yes. I'm exhausted.

421
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,765
Righto.

422
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,170
Oh, thank you.

423
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,566
What are you doing?

424
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,165
Shut up!

425
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,407
- Here we go, Mol.
- Oh.

426
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,244
- There we go.
- Oh!

427
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,442
Thank you. Who are you?

428
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,648
Mrs Dunnage, it's me, Barney.

429
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,007
Are we related?

430
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,924
No!

431
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,605
Oh. Thank God.

432
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,962
It would be safer for Molly
if you ride too.

433
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,326
It would suit her if I fell off.

434
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,403
Don't be ridiculous, Molly.

435
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,086
If I'd wanted to kill you,
I'd break your neck.

436
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,164
Everybody knows that.

437
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,765
You moved.

438
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,207
Yeah, I don't know.

439
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,284
A true killer would have cost Dungatar
the grand final.

440
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,925
So, why didn't you?

441
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,325
No, I've decided you didn't come home
to help us win the grand final.

442
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,131
I reckon you came home
for one of two things...

443
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,487
bloody revenge or... me.

444
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,001
Just so you know,
both are out of the question.

445
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,044
Pick you up Saturday at 8:00, then?

446
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,690
Footballers' dance?

447
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,802
I'm busy.

448
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,328
Oh, well, what about tonight?
We'll go to the Winyerp pictures.

449
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,686
Oh, what's on?

450
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,808
Sunset Boulevard with Gloria Swanson.

451
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,683
Still... busy.

452
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,001
Doing what?

453
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,730
Stirring her cauldron.

454
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,086
But I'd love to go.

455
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,284
You shouldn't be so rude to him.

456
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,848
He's a kind young man
who wants to take us to the pictures.

457
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,968
He wants to take me to the pictures.

458
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,646
Well, go, then.
Think I want you here under my feet?

459
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,849
Why are you so interested
in what I do all of a sudden?

460
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,925
I'm not. I don't care if you stay
an old maid forever.

461
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,610
Still not going.

462
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,764
You never came back for me.

463
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,241
You came back for them.

464
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,801
Well, go on, make them their dresses.

465
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,689
Make them think they're classy.

466
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,330
They'll still hate you.

467
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,565
Tape measure.

468
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,770
Oh, your centre line's off.

469
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,328
Got to start from the beginning again.

470
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,209
Get all these pins out and start again.

471
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,451
What's wrong with you?

472
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,805
Stay there. It's still my house.

473
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,004
Molly.

474
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,004
In trouble, is she? I'm not surprised.

475
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,481
Tilly, in the car...

476
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,810
What?

477
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,322
Molly, what is it?

478
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,326
I love you!

479
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,130
- What?
- A delivery.

480
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,211
Do you remember my possum?

481
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,171
Beloved by all, missing.

482
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,964
And I know what happened to him.

483
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,444
Tilly, certain accusations have been made,

484
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,682
requiring me by law

485
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,411
to make a thorough search
of this tea chest.

486
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,884
What am I being accused of?

487
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,449
Oh!

488
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,765
"Chocolat en poudre".

489
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,285
Chocolate milk.

490
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,566
Thank you.

491
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,241
Ah.

492
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,366
Oh.

493
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,841
Ah.

494
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,206
Ooh.

495
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,170
Ooh, my.

496
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,561
Ooh.

497
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,290
Oh.

498
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,602
Ooh!

499
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,161
Oh!

500
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,005
Ah, oh!

501
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,521
Oh!

502
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,563
Oh, good Lord!

503
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,842
Oh!

504
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,890
Oh, oh! Oh!

505
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,164
Ah!

506
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,210
This isn't how I remember you.

507
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,528
This isn't how I remember you either.

508
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,844
Well, frankly, this is how
I'd rather you remembered me.

509
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,527
Don't worry, Sergeant, not much
chance of me forgetting this.

510
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,603
I'm brilliant with sequins and diamantés

511
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,762
and I bet I can hem stitch as fast as you.

512
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,282
I'm a whiz with zippers
and gauging and frogging.

513
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,920
And how do you feel
about ruffs and flounces?

514
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,447
Oh, I hate them.

515
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,840
So do I.

516
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,324
I wish we had a better mirror
for you, Sergeant.

517
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,130
There's a mirror tree outside.

518
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,082
There is a mirror tree outside.

519
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,165
Where did you find so many mirrors?

520
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,891
I've always managed to live discreetly.

521
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,081
But, um...

522
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,763
when Stewart Pettyman died...

523
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,571
his father wanted me to send you away.

524
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,564
And you did.

525
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,041
I refused at first, but...

526
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,281
he knew about me.

527
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,010
Knew what?

528
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,769
Somehow, he managed to find
these designs I'd drawn

529
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,691
on a model that was unmistakably me.

530
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,042
Signed by me too.

531
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,761
He threatened to send them
to the district inspector.

532
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,489
I would have lost everything.

533
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,887
My home here, my...

534
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,606
my career... my...

535
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,250
Everything.

536
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,602
Betrayed for a wardrobe.

537
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,370
Ironic.

538
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,330
Saturday night, then.

539
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,361

00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,807

Stunning.

547
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,086
Where did she get that dress?

548
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,890
- It's Gertrude.
- Gorgeous.

549
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,849
Could you please play a love song?

550
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,968
Yes, of course.

551
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,289
I was just about to go... home.

552
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,410
♪ Be a thief

553
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,245
♪ Be my sunshine

554
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,728
♪ Or my grief

555
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,450
♪ Be anything

556
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,602

♪ ...be mine... ♪

558
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,245
Look at our youngsters.

559
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,881
Oh, they make a lovely couple.

560
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,489
Gert, you look like someone
out of a movie.

561
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,691
Oh, there she is!

562
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,126
Shh.

563
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,044
May I come in, Joe?

564
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,611
I've stopped crying.

565
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,250
I'm alright again.

566
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,323
Joe, tell me you're not cross.

567
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,170
- Popcorn?
- Shh!

568
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,288
I certainly don't want you
buying them for me.

569
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,442
Look, they're not even in a real car!

570
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,090
Shh!

571
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,925
Oh, there's nothing like
blue ﬂannel for a man.

572
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,930
Now, this one, single-breasted, of course.

573
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,444
Happy new year.

574
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,204
Happy new year, darling.

575
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,523
She's trying to kiss him.

576
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,567
Run!

577
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,364
Shh! Shut up!

578
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,124
- You shut up, pervert.
- Quiet.

579
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,441
This is filth.

580
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,965
Look at his face!

581
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,487
No-one told him
this scene was in the picture.

582
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,325
Shh! We're trying to watch the movie.

583
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,363
Alright, give me this.

584
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,090
I need some of your Scotch.

585
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,402
<i>Now, close your eyes. Close 'em.</i>

586
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,890
It's just that I don't want
to be left alone.

587
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,890
Watch your head.

588
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,485
Oh.

589
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,284
Strong, aren't you?

590
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,887
Have you heard of this new play
from America, Molly?

591
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,326
South Paciﬁc?

592
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,131
Oh, it sounds very...

593
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,770
romantic.

594
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,126
It sure is, Mol.

595
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,965
- I hate romance.
- What a surprise.

596
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,091
How about some music
and a... nice cup of tea?

597
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,009
How could I resist?

598
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,250
Oh, Macbeth.

599
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,084
You like this?

600
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,365
Probably not your taste.

601
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,528
"Hark, something wicked this way comes."

602
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,160
What kind of bloody awful music is this?

603
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,409
- Blues.
- Oh! Music to hang by.

604
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,123
Yeah, I don't know. I like it.

605
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,527
She's got a lot of pain in her voice.

606
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,286
Yeah. Billie Holiday.

607
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,283
Sounds like she needs one.

608
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,290
That my hip flask?

609
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,090
Come and get it, handsome.

610
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,368
- Give me that.
- Oh, not you!

611
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,646
- Give me that.
- No.

612
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,682
Give it. Give it.

613
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,370
- Oh, you degenerate!
- Give it!

614
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,249
Get your hand out of me!

615
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,765
Don't be ridiculous.

616
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,046
Careful, she's old.

617
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,929
Oh, give it, give it!

618
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,320

628
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,448
So, where did you go from here?

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,250
Away.

630
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,245
To Melbourne.

631
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,970
To boarding school.

632
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,770
Then where?

633
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,322
I ran away to London.

634
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,686
Then Spain, Milan and Paris.

635
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,845
And then back home?

636
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,848
They don't like us here, Teddy.

637
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,490
Me and Molly.

638
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,882
They'll never forgive me
for that boy's death.

639
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,323
They never forgave Molly
and she didn't do anything.

640
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,170
Yeah.

641
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,528
They tried to take Barney away
just for being different.

642
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,322
People came to the school.
I had to run and get Mum and Dad.

643
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,529
I remember you boys.

644
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,841
I used to watch you from here,
you and Reg and Barney,

645
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,405
up on top of that silo.

646
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,971
You had that...

647
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,407
You had that telescope and looked for...

648
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,688
You used to look for rockets
from outer space.

649
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,486
Yeah. And Superman.

650
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,209
You don't scare me, Tilly Dunnage.

651
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,160
In fact, I reckon you could make
some bloke pretty happy.

652
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,650
Tilly.

653
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,250
I'll look after you.

654
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,769
If you want me to.

655
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,649
I have to put Molly to bed.

656
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,488
I'd like to see Myrtle Dunnage, please.

657
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,244
I bet you would.

658
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,129
I'd like you to see.

659
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,723
Then you'd know what we have to endure
every time we look at you.

660
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,247
Oh, there you are.

661
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,641
Mad mother.

662
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,689
Molly seems well.

663
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,525
These days she's far from neglected.

664
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,410
But she has good days and not so good.

665
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,803
Gertrude Pratt told me it was you

666
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,201
who made the dress she wore to the dance.

667
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,771
That's right.

668
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,163
Well, I'd like to order some daywear...

669
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,645
if it's at all possible.

670
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,447
It is.

671
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,204
But it'll cost you. Cash.

672
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,600
Yoo hoo!

673
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,211
Oh!

674
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,888
Uh... I'll have a line
of night attire and lingerie.

675
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,486
To put some spring back in
the old mattress.

676
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,051
Thanks.

677
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,850
Off you go.

678
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,090
Am I in the right place?

679
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,844
Station Hotel.

680
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,048
But it's so far from the station.

681
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,090
Are you right there, Muriel?

682
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,730
Yeah, good, thanks, love.

683
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,965
Bulb's gone.

684
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,964
Tilly got in another tea chest.

685
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,087
Where from this time?

686
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,321
Paris? Milan?

687
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,651
New York. And it's full of cottons
and a peacock crest too.

688
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,928
A peacock crest?

689
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,246
Well, I don't know.

690
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,085
I mean, I'd imagine there is.

691
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,409
But I wouldn't know exactly
what's in the box, would I?

692
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,807
I'd better be going.

693
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,240
Your frock.

694
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,641
That's our secret.

695
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,689
It's none of your business.

696
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,441
Local girl. Up on the hill.

697
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,762
What about alterations?

698
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,922
They'll be minor.

699
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,761
And if there are any...
I can manage them myself.

700
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,085
You sew?

701
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,491
I'm a dressmaker.

702
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,007
And a seamstress.

703
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,645
Fully qualified.

704
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,171
I would like to see
what's in your workroom.

705
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,440
Would you let me into your workroom?

706
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,327
You'll be familiar with my work
soon enough.

707
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,447
Evan Pettyman invited me here.

708
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,609
Did you think they wouldn't fight back?

00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,481

Oh, you shouldn't have.

Some designers just don't seem
to know the difference, do they?

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,366
Una Pleasance.

733
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,568
I wonder what rock they found her under.

734
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,247
Just as they were starting to like me.

735
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,328
You're wasted here.

736
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,606
Oh, good shot.

737
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,127
You nearly got Pratt's store.

738
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,564
But here is where I am.

739
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,088
I think we should run away together, Till.

740
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,730
Oh! What?

741
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:39,091
Yeah. You and me.
Forget all about Dungatar.

742
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,847
Leave them to themselves and fate.

743
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,128
We...

744
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,410
You can't just... ask someone to...

745
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,005
run away with you out of...

746
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,645
...out of the blue.

747
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,609
Oh, God...

748
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,608
You should take Barney home.

749
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,926
Do you want me on my knees, Till? That it?

750
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,690
OK.

751
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,490
I can't be with you, Teddy.

752
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,770
I'm cursed.

753
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,571
Well, all I can say is thank heavens...

754
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,410
- Oh...
- ...for Una.

755
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,528
I was hoping for something
a little more...

756
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,367
slimming.

757
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,921
Oh, no. This dress is so you.

758
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,923
- Oh! Shoes off!
- Oh.

759
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,321
- I've just vacuumed.
- I'm supposed to meet my mother.

760
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,885
- Yes.
- That's... that's William.

761
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,247
- Yes. I asked him to pick me up.
- Mother?

762
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,805
In here, William.

763
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,884
But... but isn't it bad luck to see
the bride in her gown before her...

764
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,522
Nonsense. Not when the bride
looks as beautiful as this one.

765
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,126
In here, William. Come view your future...

766
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,442
Walk along the edge of the carpet!
My middle's wearing!

767
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,284
No! No!

768
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,965
- William!
- Oh!

769
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,966
- Oh! Ah! Ah!
- William!

770
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,406
William, come!

771
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,050
For goodness' sake!

772
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,726
- There!
- William! Where did she go?

773
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,247
There. There she is.

774
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,326
Gertrude!

775
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,530
We'll catch her in the car.

776
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,167
Mother!

777
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,483
On the edge! Shoes off my carpet!

778
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,851
Oh! No!

779
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,641
- Is that your dress?
- Oh, I like the bow!

780
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,326
The bow?! You would like the bow!

781
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,925
William's here!

782
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,646
Get it off me! Get it off me!

783
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,041
Oh, there's no zip! She's stitched you in!

784
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,565
Dad! Get a saw!

785
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,450
Mother, isn't it bad luck to see the bride
in her gown before the ceremony?

786
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,681
Oh!

787
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,928
Not when the bride
is as beautiful as this one.

788
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,048
- Ah! Mother!
- Alvin, shut the door!

789
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,361
Stop pushing me, Mother!

790
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,646
Sorry, folks, we're closed.

791
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,689
Out the back. Out the back!

792
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,330
Run, Gertrude, run!

793
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,931
Sir...

794
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,809
Sorry! We are closed for business!

795
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,882
- Oh! Ooh!
- Sorry.

796
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,087
Where is she?

797
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,728
- Um... Uh...
- Chickens!

798
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,450
Oh!

799
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,166
Tilly? Princess Elizabeth's here
for a fitting!

800
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,321
Myrtle!

801
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,926
Help me! Myrtle! Tilly!

802
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,645
Myrtle!

803
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,040
Oh, my God!

804
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,565
Oh, God!

805
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,009
Tilly! Gloria Swanson's here.

806
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,004
I'd like to see Gertrude Pratt.

807
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,730
No.

808
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,602
Why?

809
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,847
Well, it's bad luck for the groom to see
the bride's gown before his wedding day.

810
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,281
Mother, stop it.

811
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,011
A fully qualified dressmaker
and seamstress would know that.

812
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,049
Gertrude!

813
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,281
Gertrude, it's me.

814
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,724
Gert!

815
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,764
Sorry, Una.

816
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,610
I've decided to go back to Tilly.

817
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,003
I think she understands
my particular body shape.

818
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,924
She certainly does.

819
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,891
No. She doesn't look like that.

820
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,530
You... you've been had, my lad.

821
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,724
You... you witch!

822
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,531
I think we'll be going now, Mother.

823
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,446
You can't marry that stupid
grocer's daughter! She's common!

824
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,726
What... what are we doing here?

825
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,048
Oh, William! Oh, my God!

826
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,046
Oh, just get away!

827
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,887
- Hello, Teddy.
- Hello, mate.

828
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,166
I'm getting married next month.

829
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,845
- Would you be my best man?
- No!

830
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,128
- Yes!
- Why?!

831
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,044
I want a future! A life!

832
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,611
You have a life.

833
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,250
It's not mine!

834
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,960
Um...

835
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,209
Yeah. Sure, mate. I'll be your best man.

836
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,761
I'm gonna get ya.

837
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,323
You'll need a suit. I'll pay.

838
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,125
That could be awkward.

839
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,282
Don't talk to me about awkward.

840
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,210
Take your clothes off.

841
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,687
The others do!

842
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,046
You want me to?

843
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,565
- Yes!
- No!

844
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,245
You're fine as you are.

845
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,565
That's not what you tell them!

846
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,163
She tells them
if they want it done proper,

847
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,890
they've gotta strip and be measured,

848
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,691
because it's a work of art made special
for them and no-one else.

849
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,842
You see, Tilly? I do listen.

850
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,651
She tells them that they're all different,

851
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,804
even though they're all the same...
too fat, too skinny.

852
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,088
You'll be a sight for sore eyes.

853
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,483
Anyway... Io and behold,

854
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,530
our genius here
does make them look different.

855
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,762
Less like themselves
and more like they wanna be.

856
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,160
Don't you?

857
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,845
You just called me Tilly.

858
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,768
- When?
- Just then.

859
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,605
- I never.
- Yes, you did.

860
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,048
- And this morning... twice.
- Oh, liar. Liar.

861
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,522
Sounds like this is the most important
piece of clothing I'll ever own.

862
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,004
You could be married in this suit.

863
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,525
Yeah, I could be.

864
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,004
Snapped up by some
eligible spinster or... hag.

865
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,566
Trousers off too?

866
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,767
- Yes.
- No!

867
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,724
Most important day of a chap's life.
Want to look sharp.

868
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,766
Righto.

869
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,050
Notebook.

870
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,924
Well, it was his idea.

871
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,560
South Pacific, Molly?

872
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,889
You're right. It's very romantic.

873
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,326

876
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,970
Ooh. Much less than Gertrude Pratt.

01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,690

878

Chest.

879
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,521
Actually, the girl I fancy, Molly,
doesn't want me.

880
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,843
- Mad, is she?
- She thinks she's cursed.

881
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:57,882
41.

882
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,889
Rubbish. He's much bigger than that.

883
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,042
You can tell just by looking at him.
Do it again.

885
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,201

886
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,170
I didn't either, till she showed up.

887
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,364
- Is that comfortable?
- Yep.

888
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,881

01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,448
Couldn't be anyone else.

896
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,085
33.

897
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,560
Also less than Gertrude Pratt.

898
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,525
Make yourself something
and come to the wedding with me.

899
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,007
No-one will talk to you.

900
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,241
Good.

901
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,966
We'll dance.

902
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,728

01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,205
You've still got... Beulah, Elsbeth...

912
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,165
and me.

913
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,367
Oh, Evan.

914
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,204
Quickly.

915
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,286
Quick, quick, quick! Quick.

916
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,402
- Oh!
- Arggh!

917
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,211
- Oh!
- Oh! Ow!

918
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,810
Oh!

919
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,280
My head, my head! Oh!

920
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,522
Ow! Ah!

921
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,643
Oh, Jesus... Ah!

922
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,326
Oh, God!

923
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,806
Evan?

924
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,486
Uh... shire business.

925
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,449
Shire business, pet.

926
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,725
Una?

927
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,045
I'm inundated!

928
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,571
I'm going to see Myrtle Dunnage.

929
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,404
For what?

930
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,484
About a gown for Gert's wedding.

931
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,120
No, you can't. You can't!

932
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,570
You must have your... situation
in hand by now.

933
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,928
Besides... Una's inundated.

934
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,009
I came here despite all I heard about you.

935
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,844
Could you take your cardigan off, please?

936
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,321
But no-one's been displeased
with your work.

937
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,927
Unlike that... talentless Una.

938
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,570
Oh.

939
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,529
Don't tell Elsbeth I said that.

940
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,250
Oh, no, never.

941
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,086
It's all very hazy now, but...

942
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,121
you left, I seem to remember,
when your mother became unwell.

943
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,002
Not... not quite in that order.

944
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,685
I lost my son.

945
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,525
You know?

946
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,683
Stewart.

947
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,490
You might remember him from school.

948
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,648
He fell out of a tree and died.

949
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,330
Do you remember that day?

950
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,529
- No.
- No-one remembers Stewart now.

951
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,730
But I remember.

952
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,130
That's why I find it difficult
to leave the house.

953
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,086
Everywhere I go, I see what I once had.

954
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,365
Where Stewart once walked.

955
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,763
No-one remembers Stewart now.

956
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,404
Not his friends.

957
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,610
Not his own father.

958
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,605
Not even Beulah.

959
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,244
South Paciﬁc!

960
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,490
Could I?

961
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,570

01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,165
Something like this?

966
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,321

why did you say, "Not even Beulah"?

975
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,925
She was there when Stewart died.

976
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,370

Marigold Pettyman came to see me.

980

You need to show me
Beulah Harridene's witness statement.

981
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,082
Well, that's not possible.
It's police property.

982
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,925
I couldn't... show it... to you.

983
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,525
Oh...

984
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,251
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

985
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,125
Well, perhaps I could lend it to you.

986
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,764
Tilly Dunnage designed the wedding dress.

987
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,604
Oh! Can't wait to see it.

988
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,291
- Thank you.
- Oh, my goodness.

989
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,124
Oh. Mother of the bride.

990
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,520
Glamorous.

991
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,091
- Thank you.
- Winyerp Gazette.

992
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,245
Oh. Alvin and Muriel Pratt,
parents of the bride.

993
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,129
- Good to see you, mate.
- You too.

994
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,524
Why, it's Marigold!

995
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,529
- Marigold!
- I haven't seen her in...

996
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,484
Stunning...

997
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,921
She got Tilly Dunnage to make the dress.

998
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,570

Not invited to the wedding,
Miss Harridene?

1004
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,086
Were you in love with Evan Pettyman?

1005
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,844
You are trespassing!

1006
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,401
'Cause otherwise,
there's no explaining this.

1007
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,050

1008
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,363

playing after school.

1010
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,810
"I saw her strike Stewart Pettyman
on the head

1011
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,240
"with a brick."

1012
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,290
That file is police property!
How'd you get that?!

1013
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,841
Perhaps I subdued Sergeant Farrat
with a brick!

1014
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,601
Or... a feather boa.

1015
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,722
"I heard a sickening crack."

1016
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,884
Now, surely if this had happened,
I'd have some memory of it.

1017
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,601
I mean, who could forget
that vivid, "sickening crack"?

1018
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,444
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1019
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,085
Oh! Oh.

1020
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,804
Whoa!

1021
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,490
Oh! Help, help!

1022
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,967
Oh! Oh!

1023
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,609
"I screamed, 'Stop! Murderer! Stop!'

1024
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,162
"But Myrtle Dunnage
just looked at me and laughed."

1025
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,810
Oh, really?

1026
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,247
I don't remember being
such a mirthful child.

1027
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,081
"Whereupon Myrtle Dunnage
continued to stamp brutally,

Oh, Beulah!

01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,842
Two split infinitives.

1032
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,367
No wonder they called me illiterate
at my new school.

1033
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,764
- Hah!
- Oh...

1034
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,287
Oh, are you... are you
scared of me, Beulah?

1035
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,724
You weren't when I was 10.

1036
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,164
You would hit me with a ruler
whenever I got a sum wrong.

1037
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,129
- Or spilled the ink.
- Mmm...

1038
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,887
So why didn't you stop me
when I "stamped again and again"

1039
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,805
on the "broken poor neck"
of Stewart Pettyman?

1040
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,849
- Hmm?
- I couldn't!

1041
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,210
I was 10 years old!
I couldn't have done any of this!

1042
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,449
Everyone knew it was you!
You were the only one there!

1043
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,281
You were there.

1044
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,044
What are you insinuating?

1045
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,086
Me?!

1046
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,611
I wasn't there!

1047
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,645
I came around the corner

1048
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,770
and saw poor Stewart Pettyman
lying on the ground,

1049
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,082
his head all twisted to one side,

1050
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,369
and you... you standing over him.

1051
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,010
You lied.

1052
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,801
You didn't see any of it.

1053
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,689
He would've blamed me.

1054
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,369
- Who?
- Evan!

1055
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,164
Evan Pettyman.

1056
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,448
It was my job to protect his son.

1057
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,570
But you, you and your mad mother,
you're evil!

01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,084
You had no... you had no right.

1090
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,403
And he... he had no right to send me away.

1091
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,087
He had... a right.

1092
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,810
What does that mean?

1093
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,964
He had a parental right.

1094
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,890
What?!

1095
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,440
Evan Pettyman is your father.

1096
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,321
What?

1097
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,891
Murderer!

1098
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,486
Marigold! Don't make a scene,
for Christ's sake!

1099
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,085
Jeez, Marigold, don't...

1100
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,162
I didn't do it.

1101
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,890
- People are staring!
- Murderer!

1102
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,889
You get away from her, you bitch!

1103
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,003
Teddy! No!

1104
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,242
Teddy! Teddy, calm down. Calm down.

1105
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,528
Tell her it isn't true!
That I... I didn't kill her son.

1106
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,727
I... I couldn't have.

1107
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,129
And this... this statement
is just a pack of lies!

1108
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,327
She's mad!

1109
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,006
Look, you... you believe me.
You tell them!

1110
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,369
Tilly, it doesn't matter what I believe.

1111
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,531
I investigated the incident.

1112
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,808
I talked to everyone... everyone here.

1113
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,689
Everyone was accounted for...

1114
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,446
at home, in the pub, with friends.

1115
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,887
It is true, Tilly. I... I wish it weren't.

1116
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,963
But the fact is...

1117
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,769
you were the only one there.

1118
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,641
I want to press charges.

1119
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,842
You shut your mouth, Pettyman,
or I'll break your neck.

1120
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,286
- Alright?
- Come on, Teddy.

1121
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,841
You hit me, McSwiney.

1122
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,525
Tilly!

1123
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,562
Till.

1124
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,761
Tilly!

1125
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,161
Tilly, you moved!

1126
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,810
You moved, Tilly.

1127
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,529
Why... why...

1128
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,286
why didn't you tell me?

1129
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,211
Why?

1130
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,043
You should never have come back.

1131
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,163
But she moved!

1132
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,329
You moved, Tilly!

1133
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,645
- You moved!
- Shut up, Barney.

1134
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,202
No! She moved!

1135
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,601
I saw him! I saw him!

1136
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,491
He done it himself! I saw!

1137
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,211
- She moved, Teddy.
- I'm sorry, mate. Sorry.

1138
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,521
- No.
- Come on, calm down.

1139
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,610
- What are you trying to say?
- He done it. I saw.

1140
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,125
I saw him done it, Teddy.

1141
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,770
Hey, you've gotta calm down, alright?

1142
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,242
She moved. At the school, she moved.

1143
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,489
I saw, Teddy. I saw him.

1144
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,449
She moved.

1145
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,525
Don't. Stop.

1146
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,760
Stop!

1147
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,450
Let go!

1148
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,770
Teddy, stop it!

1149
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,410
Stop it!

1150
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,722
Wait!

1151
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,802
Stop it.

1152
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,883
Stop it, Teddy.

1153
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,122
He cornered you like this, didn't he?

1154
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,566
Made sure you couldn't scream.

1155
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,121
And then he said something to you.
What did he say?

1156
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,962
"Stand... stand... stand
really, really still, Dunnybum,

1157
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,327
"or I'll come around to your house tonight

1158
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,529
"and kill your mother, the slut.

1159
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,409
"And then, when she's dead...

1160
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,680
"I'll get you."

1161
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,489
And he let you go, but you didn't run.

1162
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,962
You just closed your eyes
and stood there. Why?

1163
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,167
Um...

1164
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,731
I was waiting.

1165
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,251
For what?

1166
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,890
What were you waiting for, Myrtle?

1167
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,246
Um...

1168
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,606
To die.

1169
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,806
To die.

1170
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,206
Stewart used to run at kids
like he was a bull. You remember?

1171
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,008
He'd run at them with his head down,

1172
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,725
ram straight in their gut.

1173
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,520
Aargh!

1174
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,686
Not this time.

1175
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,042
This time, it was just you and him.

1176
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,606
Yeah.

1177
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,364
You were gonna die, but you didn't. Why?

1178
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,445
I moved.

1179
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,203
- You moved.
- I mo... I moved!

1180
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,601
Barney saw the whole thing
from on top of the silo.

1181
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:24,128
Stewart hit the wall full pelt
and broke his own stupid neck.

1182
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,124
He didn't tell anyone because...

1183
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,563
he was afraid they'd say he was lying
and send him away again.

1184
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,090
Instead, they sent you away.

1185
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,326
Hey.

1186
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,082
You didn't kill Stewart Pettyman.

1187
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,848
He killed himself.

1188
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,722
I suppose we should get married now.

1189
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,003
Why not? It's what they'd hate most.

1190
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,811
Have a big wedding in Dungatar,
rub their noses in it...

1191
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,245
then move away.

1192
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,765
Oh...

1193
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,764
- To where?
- A better place.

1194
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,003
Where there's no Elsbeth or Beulah
or Councillor Pettyman.

1195
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,770
No hate or revenge.

1196
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,929
Better Saturday night dances.

1197
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,362
What about my mad mother?

1198
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,806
Will we take her too?

1199
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,241
Yeah. Why not?

1200
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,369
We'll even take my slow brother.

1201
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,885
Ohh.

1202
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,610
Yes, Barney.

1203
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,364
Yeah, we'll take Barney.

1204
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,445
That a yes?

1205
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,807
- So, Till.
- Mm-hm?

1206
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,486
You see any spacemen or rocket ships?

1207
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,766
Nuh.

1208
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,650
Teddy, look!

1209
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,684
It's a bird!

1210
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,644
It's a plane!

1211
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,205
It's Superman!

1212
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,720
It can't be. He's right here.

1213
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,045
With powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

1214
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,645
Fearless.

1215
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,290
Fearless.

1216
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,204
What about my curse?

1217
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,488
I told you... I don't believe in curses.

1218
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,210
I'll show you.

1219
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,930
What are you doing?

1220
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,561
Oh, you...

1221
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,091
you aren't seriously thinking

1222
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,447
of jumping off this silo in the dark?

1223
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,683
No, of course not.
That's for foolish little boys.

1224
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,241
Jumping into the silo... that's for men.

1225
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,686
What?!

1226
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,604
No, don't...

1227
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,001
No. Don't...

1228
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,207
No, don't.

1229
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,607
- What if it's empty?
- Nah, it's full of wheat.

1230
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,000
Trucks loaded in this morning.

1231
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,605
- Are those mice?
- Yep.

1232
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,766
Please, Teddy, don't.

1233
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,604
No, look, Te... No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, Teddy.

1234
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,762
- D-don't. Don't.
- Say, "I am no longer cursed."

1235
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,206
- Don't, please...
- Say it.

1236
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,407
Don't.

1237
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,369
- Teddy...
- You didn't say it.

1238
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,010
No. Wait. Ted...

1239
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,166
Teddy?

1240
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,364
That's very funny.

1241
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,885
Teddy.

1242
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,483
Alright, I'll say it.

1243
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,608
Teddy...

1244
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,125
I am no longer cur...

1245
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,647
I am no longer cursed!

1246
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,050
There is no curse, Teddy.

1247
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,370
Teddy?

1248
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,325
Teddy?!

1249
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,210
Somebody...

1250
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,486
Teddy?!

1251
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,403
Somebody... help me...

1252
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,047
Teddy! Teddy!

1253
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,567
Help me, somebody!

1254
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,484
Teddy!

1255
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,763
What's Teddy done now?

1256
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,687
They cut a big hole in that silo, Ma!

1257
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,002
Look at the wheat flying!

1258
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,487
It's not wheat, Barney. It's sorghum.

1259
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,569
Nah, Teddy wouldn't jump into sorghum.

1260
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,449
You know that.

1261
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,044
No. He'd...

1262
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,884
No, Teddy wouldn't jump into that.

1263
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,968
You can drown in sorghum!

1264
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,487
Teddy?!

1265
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,407
Mate?!

1266
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,490
Barney, why don't you take the littlies
for a walk down by the creek?

1267
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,325
Your dad and I have gotta have
a talk with Sergeant Farrat.

1268
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,402
It took them three hours
to cut a hole in that silo.

1269
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,961
Oh...

1270
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,083
He was trapped in there too long.

1271
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,444
He suffocated.

1272
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,204
No.

1273
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,124
Teddy.

1274
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,362
Teddy!

1275
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,011
No!

1276
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,007
Teddy!

1277
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,164
No!

1278
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,050
Teddy!

1279
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,210
Funeral's on Wednesday.

1280
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,486
I couldn't ask his dad or...

1281
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,120
any of the kids to help me.

1282
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,602
Didn't want none of that...
town lot touching him.

1283
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,163
Come on, then. We'll wash him
and we'll put him in his suit.

1284
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,610
My beautiful boy.

1285
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,604
Fear no more the heat o' the sun...

1286
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,601
...nor the furious winter's rages.

1287
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,840
All your worldly tasks are done...

1288
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,730
- She murdered him!
- She's cursed.

1289
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,241
She got it from her mother.
Well, I think she pushed him in.

1290
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,528
Sergeant Farrat should lock her up!

1291
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,169
It was you lot killed Teddy.

1292
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,605
He died trying to prove his love for her
was stronger than your hate.

1293
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,882
Anyone would die trying to prove that.

1294
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,928
- Free, is it?
- 10 shillings.

1295
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,402
12 shillings.

1296
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,725
As soon as she's able...

1297
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,491
I'll see to it she finishes
what she started.

1298
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,290
Because Teddy was wrong.

1299
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,641
You can't be left to yourselves.

1300
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,404
Or to fate!

1301
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,246
You're the curse.

1302
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,201
And you've got to be stopped.

1303
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,760
Oh.

1304
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,331
What's this?

1305
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,367
"Summer Eisteddfod...
Winyerp versus Dungatar."

1306
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,771
"Best play, best set design, best...

1307
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,530
"...costume."

1308
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,363
I wonder who Winyerp will get
to do their costumes.

1309
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,008
Thank heavens you have Una.

1310
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,963
You're gonna make me something. Why not?

1311
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,282
You make frocks for them.
Why not your own mother?

1312
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,364
Mother...

1313
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,131
That's right. Something smart.

1314
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,647
Suitable for entertaining.

1315
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,690
And I want you to eat, Myrtle.

1316
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,005
I met your father when I was 20.

1317
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,329
I was very naive.

1318
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,406
You don't remember him
coming to the house?

1319
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,089
- No.
- Oh.

1320
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,401
Well, I wasn't naive enough to marry him.

1321
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,881
He didn't talk to you much.

1322
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,769
You weren't a son, you know?

1323
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,245
I thought he'd just leave us in peace.

1324
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,724
Marigold.

1325
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,203
Her father was the shire president,

1326
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,364
and when he died,
he left all his money to her.

1327
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,602
Well, Evan just...

1328
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,488
swept her off her feet.

1329
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,808
Poor Marigold.

1330
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,564
He, um...

1331
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,206
He had you sent away to hurt me.

1332
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,124
I came back...

1333
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,971
- I came back...
- For me.

1334
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,600
'Cause you thought I needed you.

1335
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,531
But really, it was you that needed me.

1336
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,529
Oh! You've put on a lovely spread, Molly.

1337
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,170
And you've decorated!

1338
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,887
Cocktail snacks and cucumber
sandwiches cut real thin.

1339
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,247
It's the Dungatar social committee.

1340
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,402
Do you remember the summer eisteddfod?

1341
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,403
Dungatar is doing Macbeth.

1342
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,882
And they want you to do
the costumes. Poor old Una.

1343
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,401
No, Una's been cast as Lady Macbeth.

1344
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,530
She can't possibly be both
lead actress and seamstress.

1345
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,921
Of course not. Cocktail snack?

1346
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,607
Myrtle, the town will never forget.

1347
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:32,567
But they might forgive
if you were to win us the eisteddfod.

1348
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,650
- Trudy's the director.
- Who?

1349
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,770
Me. Oh, everyone calls me Trudy now.

1350
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:41,048
We have some ideas about what we want.

1351
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,445
Thank you, Trudy.

1352
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,802
This is baroque.

1353
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,248
Well, it is Shakespeare.
You have heard of him?

1354
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:57,530
"Double, double toil and trouble,

1355
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,160
"Fire burn, and cauldron bubble

1356
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,767
"Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake!"

1357
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,083
Oh, plays are such fun.

1358
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,289
They bring out the best and the worst
in people, don't you think?

1359
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,844
So it's... all settled, then!

1360
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,205
No.

1361
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,005
Hmm.

1362
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,161
She means it'll cost you. Cash. Up front.

1363
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,964
Or you will just have to wait
another year...

1364
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:36,601
I'd rather die than make one costume
for those vile idiots!

1365
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,808
How could you...

1366
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,328
How could you invite them up here?!

1367
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,564
- They left you to rot!
- But I'm still alive.

1368
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:50,245
They sent me away from you.

1369
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,084
But now you're back.

1370
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,930
Stop it.

1371
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,242
Stop it. Stop it.

1372
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,811
Stop it.

1373
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,490
It nearly killed me
when they sent you away.

1374
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:13,121
But I ended up hoping
you'd never come back

1375
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,448
to this dreadful place.

1376
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,967
You were better off away from here.

1377
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,202
You would have been stuck

1378
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,330
hiding with me on the top of this hill

1379
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,403
if you hadn't been sent away.

1380
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,527
But instead, you can create.

1381
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,963
You can... transform people.

1382
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:41,090
That's very powerful.

1383
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,125
Use it.

1384
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,362
Use it against them.

1385
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,721
I have a plan, Myrtle.

1386
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:00,526
Oh! You're looking lovely, Molly.

1387
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,444
You're blind, Irma.

1388
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:08,764
No. She does work magic, my girl.

1389
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,282
But she needs money to get started again.

1390
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:15,489
That's why this letter
has got to get to Winyerp.

1391
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,688
If I take it to the post office,

1392
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,729
the bastards won't send it.

1393
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:23,241
And go easy on them cakes, Irma.

1394
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,643
I made them a little bit stronger
than she would have.

1395
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,564
She's young, you know?

1396
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,041
She doesn't understand pain like we do.

1397
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,283
Goodbye, old friend.

1398
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,765
Oh!

1399
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,044
Molly?

1400
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,528
- Molly!
- Ooh!

1401
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:47,846
Oh. Alvin!

1402
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,770
God. She must have broken
something when she fell.

1403
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,729
Can we give her anything for the pain?

1404
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,521
You can't do anything for a stroke.
It's God's will.

1405
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,330
But... but she's in pain!

1406
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,927
She'll be in a coma soon
and she'll be dead by morning.

1407
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,208
You vile old man!

1408
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,522
It's alright.

1409
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,286
Mum? Oh, God.

1410
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,808
Mum. Mum, it's alright. It's alright, Mum.

1411
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,604
It's alright.

1412
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,209
Oh, God.

1413
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,365
Poor Molly.

1414
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,849
Alright, I'll change it.

1415
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,128
Don't upset yourself, Till.

1416
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,682
She would have hated that one.
She would have hated it.

1417
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,250
♪ And now you're going to tell your missus

1418
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,209
♪ When you get home

1419
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:27,250

1420
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,402
Oh, you don't like it? I'll take it off.

1421
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,168
All these... songs...

1422
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,763
are corruptive and pornographic.

1423
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,281
No wonder poor Molly got into trouble.

1424
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:46,365
It's all the fault of...
of persuasive popular song

1425
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:50,002
and... and a lecher.

1426
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,766
There'll be no more...

1427
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,123
There'll be no more... singing.

1428
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,969
Molly's dead, they're alive,
and I have to suffer!

1429
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,248
Now, Beulah...

1430
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,051
the conductor will make an announcement

1431
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,726
when you reach Melbourne,

1432
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:19,168
where a nurse will take you
to the sanatorium.

1433
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,528
I mean... specialist.

1434
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,365
Beulah says she tripped
dumping rubbish at the tip,

1435
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,410
but Prudence reckons she'd been drinking.

1436
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,722
And Gert... I mean Trudy says...

1437
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,770
Drunkenness is a sin!

1438
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,810
And God has punished her.

1439
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,923
Irma, the cushion!

1440
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,766
Argh! I can't stop!

1441
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,611
Argh!

1442
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,206
Are you OK, Mrs A?! Love?

1443
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,044
Mmm. Mm.

1444
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,849
It was her!

1445
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,365
Her on the hill!

1446
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,090
I know this smell!

1447
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,969
It's hashish!

1448
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,488
I'm telling Mayor Pettyman!

1449
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,802
Tilly drugged Mrs A.

1450
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,406
She is going to jail for this!

1451
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,443
Tilly Dunnage?

1452
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,008
We received your letter.

1453
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,162
- My letter?
- And we accept.

1454
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,890
Acc...

1455
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,610
Accept what?

1456
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:49,448
Your rather extravagant terms,
but you are the best.

1457
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,130
- "Winyerp Drama Club..."
- That's us!

1458
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,884
We want you to make our costumes.

1459
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:57,962
Oh.

1460
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,885
And isn't that your signature?

1461
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,565
Uh...

1462
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,850
"Tilly Dunnage, beloved daughter of..."

1463
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,411
Oh.

1464
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,561
Horry, wouldn't you be
more comfortable in uniform?

1465
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:23,088
No. I've always hated slum.

1466
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:29,605
But I adore marijuana cakes
and hash lamingtons,

1467
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,451
which I... bake

1468
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:36,047
and unlawfully supply
to my fellow dope fiends.

1469
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,602
In addition to my drug dealing,

1470
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,762
I'm also guilty of perversion,

1471
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,403
which I hope these signed
personal sketches...

1472
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,201
- Sergeant Farrat!
- ...will make abundantly clear.

1473
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,164
Oh, my God!

1474
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:57,685
Tilly, it seems fate has
caught up with me at last.

1475
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,446
But... but... you didn't do anything.

1476
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,329
Yes, I did.

1477
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,404
To you, 25 years ago.

1478
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,166
Perhaps I can finally make it right.

1479
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:12,290
I'm glad to have met you, Tilly Dunnage.

1480
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:16,001
You've enriched my life beyond words.

1481
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,685
Come on, Horry.

1482
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,850
But...

1483
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,048
French marigolds.

1484
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,362
What do you want?

1485
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,090
To tell you a story.

1486
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,404
Pet?

1487
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,360
Pet.

1488
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,011
Are you ill?

1489
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,604
I was ill, Evan.

1490
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:26,442
You were making me ill.

1491
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,967
But Tilly Dunnage has cured me.

1492
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,290
You followed Molly here and used her.

1493
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,807
Just like you used me.

1494
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,761
You've had lots of affairs,
haven't you, Evan?

1495
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,927
She murdered Stewart.

1496
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,844
Did you know that?

1497
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,241
Your new friend.

1498
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,444
You mean Tilly,

1499
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,409
your daughter,

1500
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,608
murdered your son?

1501
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,643
If it weren't for him, I would never
have had to marry you.

1502
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,361
You're a monster!

1503
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,171
Fall down, Marigold. Faint.

1504
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,722
Eh? Have one of your bloody headache fits!

1505
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,285
You stole all my money!

1506
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,647
You're unstable. You're drug-dependent.

1507
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,763
And the doctor knows all about you.

1508
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,684
- Certifiable.
- That's right.

1509
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,286
And I could have you committed
any time I want!

1510
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,646
Jesus!

1511
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,723
Oh! Oh!

1512
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,042
Marigold, this is very wrong!

1513
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,329
Yes. But I'm unstable.

1514
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,283
Everybody knows that.

1515
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,643
Just like they know about you
and Una Pleasance.

1516
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,131
Oh, God!

1517
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,248
They'll understand completely...

1518
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,050
Oh, please, just...

1519
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,407
eventually.

1520
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,767
Please! I'm sorry!

1521
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,645
I'm sorry! Please, Marigold, I'm sorry.

1522
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:58,569
I'm sorry!

1523
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,410
Not as sorry as I am.

1524
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,724
Oh, fuck.

1525
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:08,042
Whose idea were these
stupid fucking costumes?

1526
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,248
How dare you?! You're just a common...

1527
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,802
She knows exactly what you think she is.

1528
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,883
Trudy, control your cast.

1529
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,087
- Oh, shut up!
- Gertrude...

1530
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:18,162
- Trudy!
- Trudy.

1531
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,522
Or I'll tell everybody
what you're really like!

1532
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,322
Oh, here they come.

1533
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,960
Elsbeth, you are fired!

1534
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,891
You can't fire me!

1535
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,771
