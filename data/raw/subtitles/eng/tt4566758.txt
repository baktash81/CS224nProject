Mulan, what happened
when you fell off the roof?

00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,131
It was like you were a bird.

There's a spider
crawling in your hair.

You know
I'm afraid of spiders.

46
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,026
Mulan is young.

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,153
She is still learning
how to control herself.

48

You make excuses for her.

49
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,535
You forget, Mulan is
a daughter, not a son.

50
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,788
A daughter brings honor
through marriage.

51
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,334
Any man would be fortunate to
marry either of our daughters.

Including Mulan.

53
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,671

I think she can survive
a broken wing.

Your chi is strong, Mulan.

70
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,044

I need to confess it to you.

605

It has to do
with the three virtues.

There's no shame in being
fearful before battle.

607
