1
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,682
- There you go.
- Thanks.

2
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,617
I'm gonna be a dad!

3
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,037
I just talked to my wife.
My baby's gonna be delivered any minute.

4
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,956
- Hey, get out of the way.
- Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

5
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,917
Congratulate me.

6
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,340
Good for you, Herb.

7
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,217
Don't even think about it.

8
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,260
Hey!

9
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,807
Sorry. How are you?
Nice to see you. I'm gonna be a dad!

10
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,600
Congrats!

11
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,728
Hey, Mr. Nuts,
did you hear the news?

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,563
- Yeah.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,567
I'm here. I'm here.

14
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,987
- I'm here.
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,948
You missed the delivery.

16
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,870
It's okay.
Making the baby's the fun part.

17
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,517
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong...

18
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,229
No, I don't need to see the directions.

19
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,413
Push, push.

20
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,206
Push!

21
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,221
Twelve hours of labor.

22
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,223
Oh, but it was won'th it.

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,601
Look at him. Look at him.

24
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,187
Rodney Copperbottom.

25
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,856
He's got your mom's eyes
and my dad's nose.

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,359
I knew we were smart
to save those parts.

27
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,779
This Copperbottom will do great things
for the world, I can feel it.

28
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,280
- Honey?
- What?

29
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,532
What's that extra piece?

30
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,078
Oh, no, they always put in an extra...

31
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,997
We did want a boy, right?

32
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,127
This won't hurt a bit, son.

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,637
Got your nose. Got your nose.

34
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,514
Got your...

35
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,870
- Hi, son.
- Are those my big-boy parts?

36
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,664
They sure are.

37
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,252
They're not shiny.

38
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,131
Well, they're not brand-new.
They're preowned. So...

39
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,010
They're hand-me-downs
from your cousin Jeffrey.

40
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,761
And they're only for a year.

41
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,373
Hey, Dad, who's that?

42
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,876
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

43
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,211
The greatest robot in the world.

44
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,340
I thought you were
the greatest robot in the world.

45
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,133
No, besides me.

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,135
He's the head of Bigweld Industries.

47
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,472
He invents things
that make everyone's life better.

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,683
- Could I meet him?
- Sure, maybe someday.

49
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,226
- Dad?
- Yeah?

50
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,189
- What do you do?
- Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

51
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,733
I'm a dishwasher.

52
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,533
And now, live from Robot City,
"it's" The Bigweld Show,

53
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,120
Oh, yeah!

54
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,332
Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

55
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,001
All right, Rodney.
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

56
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,545
I had to bring work home
with me again, I'm sorry.

57
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,673
Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.

58
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,802
And now, the host of our show,
Bigweld,

59
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,473
Welcome, This week I thought you'd like
to take a look around Bigweld Industries,

60
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,644
This here is the front gate,
Kind of cute, ain 't it?

61
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,941
- Good morning, Tim.
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

62
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,193
Tim, who closed the front gate?

63
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,654
Well, I just thought since...

64
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,740
We never shut the gate, Tim.

65
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,119
Shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas.

66
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,913
See, every day, robots come here
from hither and yon...

67
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,290
...bringing us new ideas.

68
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,586
And I listen to
every single one of them.

69
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:28,471
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

70
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,391
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

71
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,643
He's talking to me, Dad.

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,688
He sure is, son. He sure is.

73
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,275
Okay, folks, let's get to inventing,

74
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,239
You know, I love to tinker,,,

75
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:51,536
,,, but all the tinkering in the world isn 't
useful unless it starts with a good idea,

76
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:59,127
So look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need.

77
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,006
One idea will lead to another,
and before you know it...

78
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,428
...you've done it.
See a need, fill a need.

79
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,098
That's it, Dad. I have to look for...

80
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,353
...a need.

81
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,533
Easy, now.

82
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,135
- Hey there, sport.
- Oh, hi.

83
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,263
These are your 12-year-old parts.
They're...

84
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,100
Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

85
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,353
- I don't mind.
- They are from your cousin...

86
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,979
...Veronica.

87
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,774
You know how popular she is.

88
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,385
Thanks.

89
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,483
Oh, hey. Hey.

90
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,530
Soon as you reach the age where your
warranty expires, you start falling apart.

91
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,241
Pretty soon there's gonna be
more duct tape than me.

92
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,786
- Can I try it now, Dad?
- Oh, Rodney...

93
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,999
- Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
- This is gonna make your job easy.

94
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,209
I invented it for you.

95
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,922
Okay. Let's try it.

96
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,842
Great. Okay, this is it.

97
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,554
Wonderbot, go to work.

98
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,903
Yeah, yeah.

99
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,830
Hey!

100
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,319
Copperbottom!

101
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,862
- Mr. Gunk.
- What is that?

102
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,907
- Oh, that. My son made it.
- What's it doing?

103
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,078
Mr. Gunk, please,
you're making it nervous.

104
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,580
It's wrecking my kitchen!

105
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,292
- I'll stop it.
- No!

106
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,339
Your son, huh?

107
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,925
It wasrt his fault.
He had nothing to do with it.

108
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,594
Yes, sir, he's a brilliant boy.
An inventor.

109
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,807
You, clean up this mess.
And, you, get out.

110
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,350
Inventor.

111
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,271
You're the hand-me-down son of a
dishwasher, and that's all you'll ever be.

112
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:50,984
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.

113
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,445
Roundtrip or one-way?

114
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,530
One-way.

115
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,786
There you are. I told you I'd find him.

116
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,540
- It's a mother's instinct.
- Instinct? He left us a note:

117
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,168
"I'm leaving.
I'll be at the train station."

118
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,004
Never mind. Pick up that suitcase.
You're coming home.

119
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,467
No, Mom. I have to do this.
I'm going to Robot City tonight.

120
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,553
I'm gonna get a job and I'm gonna
help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

121
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,096
Talk to him.

122
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,099
- Ro...
- Robot City? You're just a kid.

123
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,393
I'm never gonna be someone here.

124
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,271
I wanna be an inventor.
I wanna meet Bigweld.

125
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,856
I wanna be somebody.

126
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,524
You are somebody.

127
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,027
Somebody who's not
getting on that train.

128
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,781
- Yes, I am.
- Talk to him.

129
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,453
- One ticket for Robot City.
- Where are you going?

130
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,790
- Not me. Him.
- But...

131
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:51,628
Rodney, did you know that when I was
your age, I wanted to be a musician?

132
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,339
I played pretty well too...

133
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,509
...but my dad was worried
I wouldn't be able to make a living.

134
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,638
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I'm not complaining.

135
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,849
But I've always said to myself...

136
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:10,230
...if I could do it over again,
I would follow my dream.

137
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,525
You've got greatness in you, Rodney.

138
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,235
Never doubt it.

139
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,320
You go to Robot City.

140
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,825
You go meet Bigweld,
and you show him your big ideas.

141
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,326
And, Rodney...

142
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,330
...never, never give up.

143
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,348
All aboard.

144
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,770
Mom.

145
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,118
I won't let you down, Dad.

146
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,703
I'll make you proud.

147
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,791
I know you will.

148
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,011
Excuse me, I wonder if...

149
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,013
- Gave at the office.
- I wonder if you...

150
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,265
Could you direct me
to Bigweld Indust...?

151
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,810
- What?
- Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

152
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,269
Fifty bucks? For what?

153
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,064
A beautiful picture
of your first moment in Robot City.

154
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,400
There. Your second moment.
That's another $50.

155
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,402
Are you keeping track?

156
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,114
Come on, work with me, work with me.
More pout, less pose.

157
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,242
Great. Inside of you is a fashion model
waiting to throw up.

158
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,787
Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big eyes.
Give me big anime eyes.

159
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,291
- Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it!
- I don't want any pictures.

160
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,876
- You don't?
- No.

161
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,922
That's all right. There's no film.
Would you like a map to the stars' homes?

162
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,799
Where did he go?

163
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,905
- Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
- Don't buy us, we're fakes.

164
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,782
Next.

165
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,045
Excuse me, how do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

166
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,546
Oh, great...

167
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,469
Never mind.

168
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,400
Hi, excuse me.
How do I get to Bigweld Industries?

169
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,280
What?

170
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,827
Yeah, thanks.

171
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,330
Cross-town express
to Foundry District,,,

172
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,375
,,, with stops at Bigweld Industries
and Battery Park only,

173
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:03,588
Please tighten all spools, nuts, bolts
and detachable appendages,

174
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,842
Riders with high oil pressure
are advised to take the local,

175
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,929
Thank you, and have a nice day,

176
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,276
No, no.

177
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,869
- Say, are you following me?
- No.

178
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,872
- First time on the cross-town express?
- Well, actually, l...

179
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,374
Oh, boy.

180
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,169
Good luck in the big city. If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.

181
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,132
And if you can't make it here,
welcome to the club.

182
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,350
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

183
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,436
We're going off the track.
We're gonna crash!

184
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,022
- What?
- I don't wanna die.

185
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,077
I was just kidding.
Just put your head between your legs.

186
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,586
Yeah!

187
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,383
There goes my stop.

188
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,198
I tell you, the things that fall off me...
It's embarrassing.

189
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,803
Sorry.

190
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,403
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer...

191
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,196
Oh, they brought it back.

192
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,180
Stick with me. I know this town
like the back of my hand.

193
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,683
Hey, that's new.

194
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,082
Excuse me. Can I help you?

195
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,959
Sorry, l...

196
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:33,131
- Hey, you're Tim from the TV show.
- That's me.

197
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,674
Well, hey, Tim.

198
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,719
Who closed the gate?
It's never supposed to be...

199
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,262
Yeah, okay, what do you want?

200
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,224
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

201
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,144
I'm an inventor.

202
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,898
Oh, why didn't you say so?

203
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,192
Stand back.

204
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,544
Thanks.

205
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,254
What?

206
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,925
I got you. You see, because you were
all excited and then, boom!

207
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,680
All right, I had my laugh. Go on in.

208
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,770
Now, that's funny.

209
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,731
The second time.

210
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:36,319
You really think I'm gonna let you in.
But I'm not.

211
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,364
Sorry, kid, nobody gets in.
Company rules.

212
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,742
Company ru...? Well, then
how do they hire new inventors?

213
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,286
They don't. Those days are over.

214
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,666
My advice: Come back two years ago.
Then the job is yours.

215
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:08,101
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

216
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,645
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

217
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,358
My goodness,
what a remarkable legacy.

218
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,445
Concern for the common robot.

219
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:22,949
You don't come across old-fashioned
values like that anymore, friends.

220
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,659
And for good reason.

221
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,745
There's no money in it!

222
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,749
Hello? Memo to Bigweld:
We're not a charity.

223
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,044
That's why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair.

224
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,712
He's a relic.

225
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,175
So I don't wanna hear another,
"Where's Bigweld?"

226
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,181
We'll see him next month at the
Bigweld Ball. He always goes to that.

227
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,520
Now, let's get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny...

228
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,690
...out of
Mr. And Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

229
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,609
What's our big-ticket item?

230
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,993
Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

231
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,745
That's how we make the dough.

232
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:13,708
Now, if we're telling robots that no matter
what they're made of, they're "fine"...

233
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,337
...how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves...

234
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,131
...to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better?

235
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,802
Therefore, I've come up
with a new slogan.

236
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,597
"Why be you when you can be new?"

237
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,061
I gotta tell you, I think it's brilliant...

238
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:39,317
...but, honestly, I'd like to hear
what you employees think about this.

239
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,612
- Hear, hear.
- Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

240
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,120
Just don't look down.

241
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,340
Hey.

242
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,885
Get off.

243
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,138
Go on, get off.

244
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,641
Get off of...

245
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,519
Cappy, you haven't said a word.

246
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:18,565
- It gave me chills.
- Thank you, thank you.

247
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,692
- But...
- But?

248
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,863
I'm just wondering,
why would robots buy new upgrades...

249
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,699
...if parts are so much cheaper?

250
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,160
Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

251
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:35,331
Because as of today,
we are no longer making spare parts.

252
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,669
Do you know what I call robots
who can't afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

253
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,048
You see them on the streets,
misshapen and rust-covered.

254
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:47,969
They turn your insides out.
You wanna run home and scrub yourself.

255
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:51,097
Now, Cappy, I want your department
to push our new slogan.

256
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,142
In fact, I'm moving you
into the office right next to mine.

257
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,854
We'll be working very,
very closely together on this one.

258
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,106
- Wort that be fun?
- Oodles.

259
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,412
- Oh, so sorry, l...
- What the...?

260
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:20,960
Sir, I am a young inventor, and it has
been my dream to come to Robot City...

261
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,547
...and to present my ideas
to Mr. Bigweld.

262
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,383
Who doesn't seem to be here.

263
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,137
Gee, no, no. But while he's away,
he left me in charge.

264
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,099
Oh, well, then let me show you
what this can do.

265
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:39,979
I have a better idea. Why don't you
let me show you what it can do.

266
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,481
It can do this!

267
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,171
So how did it go?

268
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,636
What the heck
is going on around here?

269
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:16,391
Some highly polished jerk
is sitting in Bigweld's chair.

270
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:21,146
And you're sitting
on the sidewalk, magnetized.

271
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:25,567
Listen, I'll be back,
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

272
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,820
When you pick a lost cause,
you really commit.

273
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,699
Where do they make dreamers like you?
Get lost, freak!

274
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,162
All right, break time.

275
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,459
All right, break time's over.

276
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,419
Chop-chop.

277
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,381
Look who's here.

278
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,427
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie. How's my boy?

279
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:01,931
Great. I did just what you told me.
No more spare parts.

280
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:06,227
In a couple of weeks, those broken-down
losers out there will be scrap metal.

281
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,272
You will be up to your bloomers
in broken-elbow junk.

282
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,191
Such a good boy.

283
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,026
And after you finish off Bigweld...

284
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,362
...there will be nobody
out there to fix them.

285
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,572
Exactly!

286
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,783
You wanna swing that one
by me again?

287
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,286
Idiot! Those outmodes look up to him.

288
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:27,040
- Suppose he decides to come back?
- Oh, come on, Mom.

289
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,627
- He's not gonna be trouble where he is.
- What are you afraid of?

290
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,128
Grow some bolts.

291
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,798
Or do you want to end up
like your father?

292
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,384
Hey, son. Good to see you.

293
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,052
Think what it would mean.

294
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:44,099
Not Bigweld Industries,
Ratchet Industries.

295
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,600
Keep talking.

296
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,395
Ratchet City!

297
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,606
Yes, everything shiny.

298
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:55,735
No more Bigweld, no more outmode.

299
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,737
Let's do it!

300
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,989
That's my boy!

301
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,083
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something?

302
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,170
- You look thin.
- No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

303
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,505
Bye, Pop.

304
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,717
So long, son.
Good luck with your dastardly plans.

305
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,617
Hey.

306
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,870
Hi there.

307
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:53,043
Listen, if I seem to be getting smaller,
it's because I'm leaving.

308
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,961
Foot, don't fail me now.

309
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,173
Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

310
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:44,260
Oh, great. Happy now?

311
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:47,681
Not until you give me back
my foot, you mugger.

312
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:51,643
I am not a mugger. I happen to be...

313
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,894
...a scrounger.

314
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,438
I didn't know you were
at the end of that foot.

315
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,941
Here, let me help you with that.

316
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,651
No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

317
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,945
I have my pride, you know. Over here.

318
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:05,657
Oh, no. No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.

319
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,534
No. No, no.

320
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,289
What's the use? There's nothing left.

321
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:17,127
Hey, Diesel, I found you a voice box.

322
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,096
Here's another one.

323
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,017
That's no good. Give me that.

324
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,939
I can never find parts in my size.

325
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,777
What is it, boy?

326
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,031
Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?

327
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,241
Lost weight?

328
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,786
Look at where you're looking.
He's a head in a basket.

329
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,205
We're doomed, I knew it.
We're doomed.

330
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,418
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut?
Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

331
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,130
Wow, speak of the devil, here I come.

332
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,466
Dang!

333
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,218
Check this out.

334
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:11,056
Who would throw away
such a cute little doodad?

335
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:14,059
- Don't be scared.
- Hey, that's mine.

336
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,645
That's him. That's the guy.
I would know that face.

337
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:20,690
I know that face,
and I know that foot.

338
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,942
He's over there, moron.

339
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,445
That's the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.

340
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,365
- You want another piece of me?
- All right, buster.

341
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:32,535
If you think you can mess with my
big brother, you're... You're kind of cute.

342
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,330
Piper, would you behave yourself.

343
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,291
Now, come on,
let's get Fender fixed. Again.

344
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,002
Here's your thingamabob.

345
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,421
By the way, the name's Piper.

346
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,757
Rhymes with "viper."

347
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,718
See you around.

348
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,684
We've told you a hundred times:

349
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,061
"Don't talk to strange men."
Thank you, Manuel.

350
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,356
I talk to you.
Who's stranger than that?

351
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,700
I got good news, and I got bad news.

352
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,285
- What's the bad news?
- I checked the stock book.

353
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:17,789
And as of today, they are no longer
making parts for your model.

354
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,583
You have been officially outmoded.

355
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,335
Outmoded? Well, that's fine.

356
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,087
What's the good news?!

357
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:29,092
Well, when we had your parts,
they were on sale.

358
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,393
How could this happen to me?
I'm practically a kid.

359
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:42,522
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.

360
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,735
That new-upgrade smell.

361
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,529
Just came in, fully loaded. Look.

362
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,740
It's got cup-holders, standard.

363
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,366
Does it come in plus sizes?

364
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:58,204
Sure, take a look at the new
Bigweld spring collection.

365
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:04,127
I can't afford that fancy stuff.
All I need is one stinking neck joint.

366
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,589
No. Why did this happen to me?

367
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,594
I'm hurting me. Idiot.

368
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:16,306
Sorry, pal, it's either upgrade
or the chop shop for you.

369
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,224
The chop shop?

370
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:22,145
I'm fine, I'm fine. Look, no hands.

371
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,526
Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

372
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,446
- No one's going to the chop shop.
- That's right.

373
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,531
What do you think
we can get for him?

374
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,159
Will you stop? Listen, shiny pants...

375
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,870
...you get back there
and find a part for my brother.

376
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:43,541
We are not junk, we are not scrap,
and we will not be treated this way.

377
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,212
I'm sorry. I don't have the parts.

378
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,465
Well, do you have two washers,
an S-spring and some Fastweld?

379
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,133
I can fix you easy.

380
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,681
The Force is strong with this one.

381
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,652
When was the last time
you got oiled?

382
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:13,279
I can't answer that
with my kid sister here.

383
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,781
Can it, Fender.

384
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,367
Hold still. This might tickle.

385
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,494
We haven't been properly introduced.

386
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,663
I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

387
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,332
...but had to change it
when we came in to the country.

388
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,167
Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.

389
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,462
Riddle me this:
Why did I meet you among the garbage?

390
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,215
Well, today I tried
to get in to see Bigweld.

391
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:37,137
Well, if you find him, tell him
we really need him to come back.

392
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,055
He cared about bots like us.

393
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:42,475
I heard they've done him in
and left the rest of us to fall apart.

394
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,353
Well, that ought to do it.

395
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,190
Look at that! And he fixed my neck.

396
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:51,276
- Sweeper!
- Sweeper?

397
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,987
Make yourself scarce.

398
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,453
What's the big deal?

399
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,498
- Well, if you're an outmode like Fender...
- Hey.

400
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:08,001
They sweep you up
and take you to the chop shop.

401
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:12,797
Where they melt you down
and turn you into something else.

402
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:14,758
You mean...?

403
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:16,968
Yep.

404
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,511
Sweepers. Sweepers.

405
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,432
Help. Here's one outmode
you're not gonna get.

406
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,941
Fender, run!

407
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,657
That was close.

408
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,369
When in Robot City,
guests of the Rusties... That's us.

409
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,288
- Stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding house,
where our motto is:

410
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:47,916
"Beats rusting outside."

411
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:52,337
Let me just let her know you're here.
Aunt Fanny!

412
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,131
- We brought someone.
- I'm in the kitchen.

413
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:58,343
- Are you sure your aunt won't mind?
- Relax, she's not my aunt.

414
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,472
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.

415
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,724
Well, then why is she called
Aunt Fanny?

416
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,518
We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

417
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,731
Oh, crap.

418
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,566
She's a little artsy-fartsy.

419
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,695
The artsy's okay,
but when she gets fartsy...

420
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,447
Look at... Oh, right on my shoes.

421
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,157
I'm so clumsy.

422
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,411
Well, hello there. What's your name?

423
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:25,870
I'm Rodney Bigbottom...

424
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:29,124
No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.

425
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,961
That's a wonderful name, Bigbottom.

426
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,673
Well, I just...

427
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,634
- What happened to your friend?
- He's been rear-ended.

428
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,763
Oh, there you are.

429
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:47,475
Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.

430
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:50,270
Well, just make yourself at home.

431
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,480
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

432
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,065
My pleasure.

433
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:55,942
See a need, fill a need.

434
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,736
Hey, just like Bigweld.

435
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:01,072
Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

436
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,077
Come on. You can bunk with me.

437
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,121
We'll ignore the gossip.

438
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,338
You missed a spot.

439
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,631
Fender, get out of my room!

440
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,175
I'm not in your room.

441
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,552
I am now. Now I'm not.
I am. Not. Am...

442
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,721
Get out of my room.

443
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:31,353
Oh, man, this is my third oil change
today. Something's wrong with me.

444
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,772
Sorry.

445
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,776
Here we are. Home sweet home.

446
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,320
What's mine is yours.

447
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,072
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get them.

448
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,157
Look at that.
Now they're arm-wrestling.

449
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:51,039
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.

450
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:19,317
I know that sounds bad,
but I'm just doing musical arm farts.

451
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,570
You know how to do those?

452
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:26,157
They're hard to do, because we're metal,
but that's where the skill comes in.

453
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:28,118
I'm real close. Listen.

454
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,911
No, wait.

455
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,871
No, wait, wait.

456
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,875
You can't tell me that didn't sound like a...
Like an old man.

457
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,296
You know, I'm a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.

458
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,549
Kind of a rough day, huh?

459
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,427
Kind of. My dad's probably
sitting by the phone...

460
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,637
...waiting for his brilliant son
to call...

461
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:51,224
...and tell him what a big success
my first day was.

462
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,184
I know it's not your problem.

463
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,729
If you burden your friends,
you won't have any.

464
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,564
What are you, a fortune cookie?

465
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,442
"That's what friends..."

466
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:02,068
You consider me a friend?

467
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,195
Sure, what else would I consider you?

468
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:07,073
An embarrassment,
a way to rebel against your parents...

469
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,576
...a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.

470
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,453
Let's just stick with friend.

471
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,539
You know, even though you had
a discouraging day, remember...

472
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,583
...there's another one
coming tomorrow.

473
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,586
You know, my last roommate
jumped out that window.

474
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:22,255
Hey, Fender.

475
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:27,510
Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

476
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,391
Guys, come on,
what are you, 3 years old?

477
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,560
This is how a man does it.

478
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,812
You guys are so gross.

479
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:41,024
Besides, this is how you do it.

480
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,361
Hey, kids, get a load of this.

481
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,867
Aunt Fanny...

482
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,119
...we were using our arms.

483
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,914
Oh, excuse me.

484
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,958
Lady, please...

485
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,628
...see a doctor.

486
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,641
Breakfast.

487
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,309
This will perk everyone up.

488
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,812
Some of Aunt Fanny's
fresh-brewed grease.

489
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,355
Yummy!

490
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,982
Careful, it's hot.

491
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,616
So, what are you guys doing today?

492
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,369
- We're doing it.
- What about you?

493
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,496
Bigweld's disappeared,
and you're sitting here.

494
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,415
That's already been established.

495
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,751
- I gotta find out what happened to him.
- Hey, you want my advice?

496
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,753
- Sure.
- Forget it.

497
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,465
"Never try, never fail."
Those are the words I live by.

498
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:50,719
Crank, the idol of millions is gone,
and no one seems to care.

499
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:53,221
There should be an angry mob
out there.

500
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,973
What the...?

501
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:00,228
Wow, that was great, psychic friend.

502
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:03,857
Now say, "Money should be
falling from the sky."

503
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,526
Say it. Say it.

504
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,613
Sorry, folks, all sold out.

505
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,116
Nothing but upgrades from here on in.

506
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,036
But I like myself just the way I am.

507
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:18,705
- We can't afford upgrades!
- Let's get him!

508
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,916
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Don't throw me.

509
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:24,919
Isn't that the guy
that fixed Fender's neck?

510
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,755
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

511
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:28,757
Yeah, that kid can help you.

512
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:31,176
Brace yourself.
You're about to get popular.

513
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,137
Only those with insurance.

514
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,307
Oh, I forgot. Everybody, come on.

515
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:40,143
Parts, man. I need parts.

516
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,063
You don't look that... bad.

517
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:46,816
- Hey, everybody, spare parts!
- Yeah!

518
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,236
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you robots?

519
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,655
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

520
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:54,324
Why do you have two noses?

521
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:57,619
One's for showing, one's for blowing.

522
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:01,164
- Sorry.
- Hey, could you look at my arm?

523
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:03,792
- Nice grip.
- Like iron.

524
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,128
- I can't get rid of this spare tire.
- I am losing my mind.

525
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,297
Back off, back off.

526
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:12,175
He's got his own dreams
that won't come true.

527
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,266
See a need, fill a need.

528
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,227
Wait.

529
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:25,063
Who wants to get fixed?

530
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,525
Thanks, Rodney. You're number one.

531
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:30,378
Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

532
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,181
Oh, yeah.

533
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:44,601
I have never felt so relaxed.

534
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:49,105
Say, do you mind giving me a little
scratch between the shoulder blades?

535
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:52,317
There you... Easy, tiger.

536
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:54,152
Hey! Take it easy.

537
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,696
Hey, what are you trying to do,
kill me?

538
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:59,574
Relax. It's me, your mommy.

539
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,535
- How did you get in here?
- I came up the air shaft.

540
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:05,372
I know you don't like
anybody here to see me.

541
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:08,375
- Well, what do you want?
- Someone's fixing them.

542
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,628
- What?
- Someone is repairing outmodes...

543
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:14,464
...and they are laughing at you.
- Who?

544
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:17,133
And are you sure they're not
laughing with me?

545
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,885
Yes.

546
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:22,931
So what if one crazy fanatic repairs
a few outmodes? Who cares?

547
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:26,685
Think. Use those brains
I stole for you. Today, it's one.

548
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:29,854
What about tomorrow, when
everybody gets the idea this is okay?

549
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,816
"We can fix ourselves.
We don't need upgrades.

550
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,401
We want Bigweld."

551
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,569
Then what happens to you?

552
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,697
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

553
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:41,866
We've got to find out
who this is and stop him.

554
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:45,787
Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.

555
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:50,208
And by the way, I brought you
a little something for your desk.

556
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,885
- Is there anyone else waiting?
- Let me look.

557
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:05,056
- A few.
- "A few"?

558
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:08,351
What did you expect, Rodney?
Bigweld was gone.

559
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:13,189
Sweepers were on the loose,
but then came Copperbottom.

560
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:15,859
I'm getting all static-y
just thinking about it.

561
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:18,862
I'm not Bigweld.
These robots need parts.

562
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,740
Mail call. Mail call.

563
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:24,284
Copperbottom,
this one's from your mom.

564
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,536
Oh, is there anything for me?

565
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,456
Oh, I got something for you.

566
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,374
That's from my sister.

567
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,043
I recognize the handwriting.

568
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:35,337
Is anything wrong?

569
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:38,965
I'll say. His father's got
one foot in the junkyard...

570
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,802
...and if they can't find new parts
for him, he's only got a few miles left.

571
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,056
Rodney, are you really worried
about your dad?

572
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,849
Do you wanna go home?

573
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:50,060
Well, if I go home,
I still can't help him.

574
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:52,812
We're out of parts.
We've gotta get to Bigweld.

575
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:56,066
He's the only one that can fix this.

576
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:01,529
He's trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

577
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,033
Bigweld is going...

578
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,534
...dancing.

579
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:09,746
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

580
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,874
You can't have the Bigweld Ball
without Bigweld.

581
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,752
Well, that's it, then.
I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.

582
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,088
What? That's the fanciest party
of the year.

583
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:19,923
You'll never get past the gate.

584
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,895
- Can I help you?
- I think maybe you can.

585
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:37,273
This is Count Roderick
von Brokenzipper.

586
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,484
Formerly Count Velcro.

587
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,028
Where are the trumpets?

588
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:45,031
We were promised trumpets
to announce the count's arrival.

589
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:48,451
Sorry, Your Grace.
Beat me until you're happy.

590
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:52,038
He's happy. And I'm not feeling
too bad myself.

591
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:56,084
- Let me... You're not on the list.
- We're what?

592
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,169
Once again.

593
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:02,007
Thank you. Fine, we will go.

594
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:03,842
You'll explain to your superiors...

595
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:08,304
...why we were not able to attend your
little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

596
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,598
But we're leaving in a huff.

597
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:13,518
No, no. No. Please, go right in.

598
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:16,730
In fact, would the count
like to hit me?

599
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:19,941
The count hit you?
The arrogance of some people.

600
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,069
I will hit you on his behalf.

601
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,530
Thank you, Your Grace.

602
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:30,076
Okay, let's split up.

603
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:33,079
If you see Bigweld, come and find me.

604
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:36,082
If anything goes wrong,
we'll signal each other.

605
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:39,836
What kind of signal do you want?
You want something kind of subtle, like:

606
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:42,255
Or:

607
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:44,966
Oh, how about this:

608
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:53,266
Ricola!

609
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,019
Subtle. Let's get to work.

610
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:59,272
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

611
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:00,899
Yes, sir.

612
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,795
I'll have what he's having.

613
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:26,299
You know, Cappy, it's nice that you
can see me like this, away from work.

614
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:30,553
See my more casual, fun-loving side.

615
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:36,267
Now, where were we?

616
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:39,896
Well, there are never any
interesting men at these parties.

617
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:43,108
Hello, ladies.
Fender von Fender at your service.

618
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:45,735
Hi, I'm Loretta...

619
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:47,195
...Geargrinder.

620
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:51,866
Anyone dressed as badly as you are
must be an eccentric billionaire.

621
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:56,329
Ladies and gentlebots,
now coming to the stage...

622
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,581
...the top bot, the big bolt...

623
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:02,502
...who's your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

624
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:05,922
Thank you. We now come
to the point of the evening...

625
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:09,509
...where I have the tremendous honor
of introducing...

626
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:12,846
- Excuse me. Sorry.
...our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

627
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:15,598
...who, unfortunately,
is unable to attend.

628
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,477
- What?
- He sends his apologies...

629
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:22,230
...his love and a small box
of assorted cookies.

630
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:25,442
- Not coming?
- And what are you doing here?

631
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:27,360
What have you done with Bigweld?

632
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:31,614
How come we don't see him
anymore, huh?

633
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:34,951
Okay. Security,
we have a party-crasher.

634
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:39,372
Yeah, that's right, and I had to put
all this junk on in order to get in here...

635
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:43,877
...so that I could tell Bigweld
that you are outmoding millions of bots.

636
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:47,297
And I know because
I spend all day fixing them.

637
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,007
You.

638
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:12,781
Oh, my darling, that is the cry
of the deep-doo-doo bird.

639
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:14,824
I must fly.

640
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:17,702
Take him for a drive...

641
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:21,873
...and bring me back
his exact weight in paper clips.

642
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,543
- No!
- No?

643
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,296
I'll escort him out.

644
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:31,424
You don't wanna look bad
in front of your people, do you?

645
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,093
- Good point.
- When I get back...

646
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:35,345
...I'll show you my casual,
fun-loving side.

647
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:37,180
Oh, you.

648
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,641
- Get moving.
- What? What are you doing?

649
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,726
Saving your life.

650
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:44,521
- Come on.
- Let him go.

651
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,356
Let him go. Let him go.

652
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,733
- Get out of here, you idiot.
- Get him!

653
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,735
- Fender, let's go.
- You know him?

654
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:52,570
Fender, wait for me.

655
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,781
Wonderbot.

656
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:58,576
Get out of my way!

657
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,913
Hey, Tim,
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

658
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,165
Oh, you again.

659
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:09,587
Oh, that was amazing.

660
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:13,174
- So where do we go now?
- I'm taking you to the train station.

661
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:16,594
- What? No way.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

662
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:19,097
Ratchet will use your head
for a hood ornament.

663
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:21,766
I'm not leaving until I find Bigweld.

664
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:23,810
- That's not...
- Can't you take me to him?

665
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,440
I must be out of my mind.

666
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:41,411
"Au réservoir", my darling.

667
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,999
- Thanks for walking me home.
- Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

668
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,252
- Until tomorrow?
- I shall count the seconds.

669
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:51,629
So far, I'm up to four.

670
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,841
You crazy nut boy.

671
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,260
Crazy about you.

672
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:13,234
I'm singing in the oil

673
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,696
I'm singing in the oil

674
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:19,699
After all that work and toil

675
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:23,745
I'm just slipping in the oil

676
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:27,290
I know where I've been sent

677
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:30,919
I'm covered in lubricant

678
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:33,171
My life has turned around.

679
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:37,300
From now on, I'm a winner!

680
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:40,679
Stop, you've made a mistake.
I'm alive. You can't do this.

681
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:42,347
Help.

682
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:53,233
Okay, we tried. Let's get out of here.

683
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,943
No, no, no. Something's up.

684
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,112
Look at all these newspapers
and this mail.

685
00:53:57,278 --> 00:54:00,115
Come on. They probably
stopped delivering these years ago.

686
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:01,908
Paper.

687
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:05,787
Late edition.

688
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:08,998
- You say something?
- Nice one of you.

689
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:12,002
Come on.
We gotta get you out of here.

690
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,971
Big, creaky door.

691
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:24,305
Perfect.

692
00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:51,708
Look at this.

693
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,960
This is Bigweld's actual workshop.

694
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,129
I recognize it from his old TV show.

695
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:59,841
Could you keep it down?
We're not supposed to be here.

696
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,470
Do you know what these are?

697
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:06,348
These are Bigweld's
original invention designs.

698
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:09,601
- That's his own writing.
- This is strange.

699
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:12,103
How come it just stops in the middle?

700
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,314
Look at this.

701
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:18,109
Remember, he used to have
these on his show?

702
00:55:18,276 --> 00:55:20,653
Rodney, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

703
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,947
Why are they so dusty?

704
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:25,033
Wait, don't.

705
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,020
This is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show.

706
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,349
Rodney, what do we do?

707
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:35,186
I don't know.
This is kind of a first for me.

708
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,611
- Yeah!
- It's him.

709
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,999
- Who's the king of the beach?
- Are you all right?

710
00:56:56,207 --> 00:57:00,295
Well, considering I'm an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor...

711
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:03,214
...I'm fantastic.
Now, who the heck are you?

712
00:57:03,381 --> 00:57:04,674
I'm Rodney.

713
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:07,802
Oh, I thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy.

714
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,805
Come on, let's set them up again,
only bigger.

715
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:13,933
Sir, is this what you've
been working on?

716
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:17,020
This is why no one sees you?

717
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:20,440
Young man,
nobody likes a chatterbox.

718
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:22,650
But there's a terrible crisis,
Mr. Bigweld.

719
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:25,153
We need to talk.

720
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:30,450
Son, I've gotta tell you,
you're making a lousy first impression.

721
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:34,954
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan.
In fact, he's an inventor just like you.

722
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:37,165
- Well...
- Show him that thing you made.

723
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:39,668
A device? A doohickey?
A thingamajig?

724
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:45,590
Now, don't be scared.
Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

725
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,051
Go on. It's okay.

726
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:54,808
Is that what it's supposed to do?

727
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:58,103
It gets nervous under pressure...

728
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:00,855
Son, let me give you
a good piece of advice.

729
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:02,899
- Yes?
- Give up.

730
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:05,735
What? You're telling me to quit?

731
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:09,155
I said "give up,"
but "quit" works just as good.

732
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,493
Is that what you did?
Is that why you're sitting here...

733
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,913
...letting Ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes?

734
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,000
Kid, sometimes you just gotta know
when you're licked.

735
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:23,670
But you're Bigweld.
You can fix anything.

736
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:25,338
I used to think so.

737
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:28,842
To me, having the company
was all about making life better.

738
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:32,178
With Ratchet, it was making money
that came first.

739
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:36,474
I became old-fashioned, an outmode.

740
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,437
Go home, kid.
If he beat me, he's gonna beat you.

741
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:43,940
The world you're looking for
no longer exists. You missed it.

742
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,900
Find some other foolish dream.

743
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:48,820
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very, very...

744
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:51,906
...very busy.

745
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:54,743
Yeah, I can see that.

746
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,206
All I ever wanted
was to grow up to be like him.

747
00:59:11,468 --> 00:59:13,428
Help. Open the door.

748
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:15,638
Open the door.

749
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,184
Close the door. Close the door!

750
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:32,155
Wow, look at all these parts.
It's a smorgasbord.

751
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:35,241
Look at that. So many things
I've wanted all my life.

752
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:36,951
Oh, that's pretty.

753
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,513
Okay, Mother, this way.

754
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:58,682
Let me look, please. I can't bear it.

755
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:01,309
No peeking, now. It's a surprise.

756
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:02,811
Oh, you are a wicked boy.

757
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,479
And look.

758
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:07,899
- For me?
- It's got a full tank of gas.

759
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:10,068
If you're ready to mow,
she's ready to go.

760
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:13,363
Has any mother ever had a better son?

761
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,199
By the way, I found out
who's been fixing those outmodes.

762
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,867
So tomorrow, these babies...

763
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:20,578
...are gonna chop him up
along with all his buddies...

764
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:24,124
...and every other walking pile of junk
I'm sick of looking at.

765
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,127
What's that?

766
01:00:57,657 --> 01:00:59,784
This is so wrong. This is so wrong.

767
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,079
Help. Help!

768
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,298
Rivet Town, please. One-way.

769
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:19,179
Hi, Mom.

770
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:22,557
Oh, I'm doing fine. How are you?

771
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:26,519
- "And Dad?"
- He's right here. I'll put him on.

772
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:29,230
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

773
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,274
Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

774
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:34,736
Oh, fine, fine. I...

775
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:37,739
I've just been a little
under the weather.

776
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:39,991
No, we're just having a little trouble...

777
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:43,244
...finding your old man
a replacement part, that's all.

778
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:46,206
But let's talk about you.
What kind of work are you doing?

779
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,166
What's Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?

780
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:51,127
Yeah, I met him, but...

781
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:53,672
What's wrong, son?

782
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,384
It's not how we thought it was, Dad.

783
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,387
It's not... I can't...

784
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:02,681
I see.

785
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:05,141
- I'm really sorry I let you down.
- No, no, no.

786
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:08,103
You could never let me down, Rodney.

787
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:13,525
Listen, I know it isn't easy, Rodney...

788
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,236
...but a dream
that you don't fight for...

789
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:20,031
...can haunt you
for the rest of your life.

790
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:22,909
Yeah, Dad.

791
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,286
It's up to you, son,

792
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:32,127
- Your father loves you very much.
- I know.

793
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:36,256
With our Friends and Family plan, you
can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

794
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:38,008
Free nights and weekends.

795
01:02:38,216 --> 01:02:40,593
Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

796
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:42,429
Wait.

797
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:46,224
- Your suitcase.
- Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I'm...

798
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,019
The others wanted to come
and see you off too.

799
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:50,687
Well, why didn't they?

800
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,773
Oh, they did.

801
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:57,318
Next time, let's split a cab.

802
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,157
Who the heck is she?

803
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:05,368
I used to have a figure like that.

804
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:07,871
Hurry, come on.
One ticket to anywhere.

805
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:09,748
Fender?

806
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:11,708
I have a sister.

807
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,169
An ugly sister.

808
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:17,047
Hey, guess what. It's the sweepers.

809
01:03:17,213 --> 01:03:20,800
They're rounding up outmodes
and taking them... What "them"? Us.

810
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:22,761
- To Madame Gasket's chop shop.

811
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,722
- And guess who's really behind it all.
- Ratchet.

812
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:28,391
You don't wanna guess?
I ran all this way in heels.

813
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,143
- Come on, take a stab.
- Ratchet.

814
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:33,271
Ratchet! Listen to me. Listen to me.

815
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,150
- We won't last a week.
- Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

816
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,652
- Let's all get on that train.
- Come on.

817
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:42,405
Hey, wait a minute.
You're all giving up?

818
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,574
- You started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

819
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,619
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld
would fight our battles.

820
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:49,871
Well, he won't. It's up to us.

821
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:52,791
If we don't do something
about Ratchet, no one will.

822
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:54,709
Come on, let's fight back.

823
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:56,878
Fighting never solved anything.

824
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,673
Quitting isn't so productive either.
I gotta tell you.

825
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,800
It's the big boy.

826
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,094
Oh, be still, my pump.

827
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:07,055
Kid, if you're gonna fight,
I'm going in with you.

828
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:08,640
You... You are?

829
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,893
Hey, who's the dame
with the sweet keister?

830
01:04:12,102 --> 01:04:13,561
- But why?
- I don't know.

831
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,814
I'm a big guy,
and I like women with large...

832
01:04:16,022 --> 01:04:18,608
No, no, no.
Why are you gonna help us?

833
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:22,153
Because I wanna grow up
to be like you.

834
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:27,826
Then let's do it.

835
01:04:28,034 --> 01:04:33,164
Come on, gang. Let's give
that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

836
01:04:34,624 --> 01:04:37,794
Oh, what a man.

837
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:39,963
Someone get a crane.

838
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:49,305
Mother, I'm an adult, okay?

839
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:52,559
So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I'm doing it today...

840
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:56,855
...how I want, where I want
and with whatever I want.

841
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:03,862
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
I want you both there.

842
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,489
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

843
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:08,825
No, no. You stay here...

844
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,995
...and watch Daddy's limo.
- Yes, sir.

845
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:14,039
I'm going inside to kick some booty.

846
01:05:14,247 --> 01:05:16,458
Hey, you know,
your boyfriend here is a genius.

847
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,293
- What?
- Oh, he's not my... He is?

848
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,170
I am?

849
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,590
Thanks for still believing in me.

850
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,969
It's good to be home. Toodley-oodley!

851
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:40,190
I use the Brazilian wax. It makes me
feel like every day's a fiesta.

852
01:05:40,398 --> 01:05:42,359
Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10:00 is here.

853
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:43,943
I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

854
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,535
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

855
01:05:53,286 --> 01:05:55,246
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

856
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:01,252
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

857
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:04,089
No, no. Tell him I'm not here.

858
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:07,050
- Tell him anything, just don't let him in.
- Ratchet!

859
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:11,513
- I'll cut to the point.
- What happened?

860
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:13,598
Run out of dominoes?
I'll send you more.

861
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,267
- You're fired!
- Fired? On what grounds?

862
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,603
This company's
never been more profitable.

863
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,605
Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

864
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:23,733
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can't do this to me.

865
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:26,861
This job is my life.
It means everything to me.

866
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:29,072
You don't know
what I've done to get here.

867
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:34,035
The lies I've told. The lives I've ruined.
This isn't helping me.

868
01:06:34,577 --> 01:06:36,788
- Get me security.
- Wait, please.

869
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:39,708
Can't I just make
one more heartfelt plea?

870
01:06:39,874 --> 01:06:41,668
Okay, what did you wanna say?

871
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:43,420
That.

872
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,340
Oh, my gosh.
I'm as crazy as my mother.

873
01:06:56,182 --> 01:07:00,145
Take that fish to the chop shop
and put my name on his parking space.

874
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:01,855
Let go of him.

875
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,942
Sure. Listen, kid, it's over. You lost.

876
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:09,446
Bigweld is gonna be melted down
into next seasors upgrades...

877
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:13,658
...along with you,
your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.

878
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,703
Such a waste.

879
01:07:51,946 --> 01:07:53,823
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

880
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:56,785
I'm the prettiest girl
at the Harvest Moon Ball.

881
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,329
I'll take that as a "no."

882
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:14,302
Out of the way!

883
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:18,098
Rodney.

884
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,862
Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!

885
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:34,698
You guys are so embarrassing.

886
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:38,576
Oh, that's Rodney.
He's in some kind of trouble.

887
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,578
I've gotta repair him.

888
01:08:40,745 --> 01:08:43,123
Okay, I got your back.

889
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:51,881
Come on, we've gotta help Rodney.

890
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,469
- No, Piper, you stay here.
- No way.

891
01:08:56,636 --> 01:08:59,723
Let's be honest. We're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

892
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,100
Whatever happens to us,
make something of yourself.

893
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:05,895
You're the only thing
I've got to leave behind. Goodbye!

894
01:09:06,062 --> 01:09:07,522
He's right, Piper.

895
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:09,983
They're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

896
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,225
Okay, got it!

897
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:46,394
Rodney, what's going on?
Where are we?

898
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:48,271
It's okay. You're all right.

899
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:11,294
Okay, boys, we got them
right where they want us.

900
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:12,962
Boost me up.

901
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:15,882
Watch your hands down there.

902
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:20,095
Rodney! We're here to save you!

903
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,063
How do you think it's going so far?

904
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:39,989
The plug.

905
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,243
Hold on, guys!
I gotta get to the other side.

906
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:16,109
We're out of here!

907
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:37,714
The chop shop.

908
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:41,551
- That's it. Game over.
- The game is not over.

909
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:43,887
This is our moment to shine.

910
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:47,098
This is where you show
what you're really made of.

911
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:52,145
In my case, it's a rare metal.
It's called "afraidium."

912
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:54,689
It's yellow. It tastes like chicken.

913
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:58,234
I didn't know I could do that.

914
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,861
Rodney's right.

915
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:05,367
I am tired of just complaining
and never doing anything.

916
01:12:05,575 --> 01:12:07,118
L... l...

917
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:09,579
I wanna try.

918
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:11,164
No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

919
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:14,626
Yes! I want to try.

920
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:16,753
Then you're first.

921
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:20,423
First for what?

922
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:24,761
They want us to upgrade?
Then let's upgrade.

923
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:33,937
Gasket, you're a sick, twisted,
evil robot.

924
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:35,355
I try.

925
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:09,347
Oh, good.

926
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,266
Company.

927
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:16,229
So you're the little glob of tin
who's been making all the trouble.

928
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:18,148
Who are these losers?

929
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:20,400
- We, sir...
- I'm a woman.

930
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,110
Ouch.

931
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:24,946
We've come to rescue our friend,
you evil bag of bolts.

932
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:28,241
And you will be defeated
by the very outmodes...

933
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,703
...that you scorned and defaced.

934
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:35,498
Yeah, because there's seven of us
and only one of you.

935
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,881
There's seven of us and... Eight, nine...

936
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:45,050
- Did you count that one?
- I think so.

937
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:48,094
Could you all stop moving around?!
It's so frustrating!

938
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:50,055
I think I counted one of you twice!

939
01:13:50,263 --> 01:13:53,433
While you're at it, count these.

940
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:02,525
As soon as we're done with you,
these hit the streets.

941
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:07,655
This is the last day
any outmode will ever see.

942
01:14:16,873 --> 01:14:18,583
Did I miss the butt-whupping?

943
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:22,754
- No.
- Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

944
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:32,138
Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!

945
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:35,392
- Well, let's get started.
- Testify, sister!

946
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:39,062
- Charge!
- Charge!

947
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:04,796
Oh, no! He's got a steel chair,

948
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,510
But he's back up into a neck-breaker,

949
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,721
He's up to the top rope,

950
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:16,516
- Look at the hang time!
- That's sure gonna leave a dent,

951
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,056
Say hello to my dimpled friend.

952
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,308
This is gonna get greasy!

953
01:17:26,646 --> 01:17:30,608
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I sure am.

954
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:47,584
See a need, fill a need!

955
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:49,878
This isn't what I was thinking at all.

956
01:18:02,849 --> 01:18:05,518
What are you doing? Get off me.

957
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:10,190
Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

958
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:17,655
Ma!

959
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:21,576
My upgrades!

960
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:48,895
It's all right, son.
You can shine no matter what you...

961
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:51,940
No! Just stop!

962
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:53,400
Come on, Rodney.

963
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:56,444
Let's open the gates
of Bigweld Industries forever.

964
01:18:56,653 --> 01:19:00,323
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I need to do first.

965
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:05,453
Herb!

966
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:07,580
- Herb!
- Honey, what are you doing here?

967
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:10,166
- It's Rodney, honey.
- Rodney? Is he all right?

968
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:11,918
Come outside. Hurry.

969
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:14,295
Copperbottom, where are you going?

970
01:19:14,462 --> 01:19:16,089
What about the dishes?

971
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:20,760
Hey, get back here!

972
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:23,722
You'll never wash in this town again.

973
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:29,644
What is all this?
The whole town is out here.

974
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:33,356
- Rodney?
- Dad!

975
01:19:33,606 --> 01:19:35,316
There's someone I want you to meet.

976
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:37,819
- Is that...?
- That's Bigweld, Dad...

977
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:40,196
...the greatest robot in the world.

978
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:42,032
Besides you.

979
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:46,619
- I understand you need a few parts.
- Well, I'm not one to complain.

980
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:51,249
Well, then don't. I've brought
enough parts to make two of you.

981
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:55,378
Ladies and gentlebots...

982
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:58,340
...I came all this way...

983
01:19:58,506 --> 01:20:00,800
Would you cut that out?
It's very distracting.

984
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,469
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

985
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,012
Where was I?

986
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,807
Mr. And Mrs. Copperbottom,
I came all this way...

987
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:11,603
...to tell you in person
that your son, Rodney...

988
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:15,398
...the man who got me
off my big titanium "tochis"...

989
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:20,653
...is now my right-hand bot
and my eventual successor.

990
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:24,991
Way to go, Rodney!

991
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:29,829
Oh, Mom.

992
01:20:31,122 --> 01:20:32,665
Son.

993
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:37,253
Dad, I know you kind of felt bad
when I was growing up...

994
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:40,382
...that you couldn't give me
a lot of stuff.

995
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,634
But you gave me
the most important thing:

996
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:44,761
You believed in me.

997
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,138
From the second you were born.

998
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:51,226
Well, Dad, now I want your dream
to come true.

999
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:55,105
Dad, you always wanted to be
a musician.

1000
01:20:55,355 --> 01:20:58,274
Now be one, for everyone to hear.

1001
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:11,663
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!

1002
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:13,415
- Good job!
- Way to go.

1003
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:16,459
Now I'm sure I've got a heart,
because it's aching.

1004
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:19,671
You'll have to forgive me.

1005
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,215
I'm a little rusty.

1006
01:21:36,354 --> 01:21:38,398
Well, there goes our happy ending.

1007
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:41,484
No. It's a fusion of jazz and funk.

1008
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:43,153
It's called "junk."

1009
01:21:57,959 --> 01:22:00,170
I love you, Herb!

1010
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:25,005
- Fender!
- Loretta, my darling.

1011
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:27,674
Sorry.

1012
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:34,180
I was on the list!

1013
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:38,226
Don't you know who I am? Wait!
