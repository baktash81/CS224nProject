1
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:03,781
Strange.

2
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,719
Who'd do something like this?

3
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,980
Maybe someone got a little upset
about their roaming charges.

4
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:15,424
Stealing satellite phones
makes sense. You can hock them.

5
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,236
You can run up charges
on somebody else's account.

6
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:21,766
But burning them?

7
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:23,682
Youngsters?

8
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,635
Pulling some prank?

9
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:27,461
No.

10
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:30,045
They'd have left a note.

11
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,837
"Fuck you" to their parents...

12
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:35,428
...or the world or whatever.

13
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,548
Not a bad idea, though.

14
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:02,467
I brought Peggy here
on our first date.

15
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,518
Yeah, we all did.

16
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,803
Not Peggy, of course.

17
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,705
Yeah, I got you.

18
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,112
Last sunset in a month...

19
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:19,686
...always works.

20
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,039
Come on. Let's go do the sign.

21
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,740
You okay, Eben?

22
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,900
Yeah.

23
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,841
Why do you even bother with that?
Nobody's gonna see it for a month.

24
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,283
It's tradition.

25
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,398
Put this off till the last minute,
didn't you?

26
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,153
There's a lot of small towns
in this state.

27
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:45,028
My boss wants all his gear inspected
and certified by the 31st.

28
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,128
And I noticed you saved
Barrow for the last.

29
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,835
You sure you don't wanna stay?

30
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,197
Me and Jeannie were hoping
you and Eben...

31
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,782
...might rethink
this separation thing.

32
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,816
Thanks.

33
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,614
I...

34
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,334
...gotta make the plane.

35
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:19,068
Okay, sweetie. I know you can't
handle a month with no sun.

36
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:22,086
I promise I won't live on
Oreos and Snapple, all right?

37
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,959
Have fun in Seattle.

38
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:33,600
Yeah. So long, Kirsten.
I'll call you when I get there.

39
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:36,740
Goodbye.

40
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,059
Got a problem?

41
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,222
Nothing I can't handle
my own fucking self.

42
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,836
This for generators?

43
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:33,182
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

44
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:37,540
Beau, I have to cite you for it.
I can't have it leaking on the street.

45
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,208
What?

46
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,529
For that? You don't...

47
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,524
You don't have to cite me.

48
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,468
You don't have to do anything.

49
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:58,397
Isn't that why we live out here?

50
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,125
You know, for a little freedom?

51
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,637
Happy motoring.

52
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:12,582
Yeah, I'll add it to my collection.

53
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,982
You know, Beau's not so bad.
Why'd you bother writing him up?

54
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:23,074
He lives all alone out there
on the south ridge.

55
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:27,237
A little citation now and then
lets him know he's a part of this town.

56
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:31,134
<i>Eben? Come in, Eben.</i>

57
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:34,491
Yeah, Helen.

58
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:37,662
<i>Something bad's happened
to John Riis' dogs.</i>

59
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:49,093
<i>Well, folks, you're listening
to KBRW, Barrow, Alaska.</i>

60
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,301
<i>Today's the last day...</i>

61
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,909
<i>I'm leaving too, getting
on that last plane out of here.</i>

62
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:18,881
Hey, Stella, are you okay?

63
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,064
Damn it, Malekai.

64
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,043
Don't you know what
"right of way" means?

65
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,548
I'm sorry, Stella.

66
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,688
The brakes jammed and...

67
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:34,051
Eben wanted this back from the airport
before the storm hit, and I was...

68
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:37,182
Oh, shit.
Who's gonna run me to the airport?

69
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,618
Well, wouldn't Eben?

70
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,359
My mom could come down
and give you a tow...

71
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,762
...but, you know,
she don't move too fast.

72
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:47,844
Fuck! Where's my phone?

73
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,547
It's me.

74
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,021
Surprise.

75
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,389
L... I need a ride to the airport.

76
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:26,364
What?

77
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:30,085
You're in town,
and you didn't wanna talk?

78
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,101
<i>I had fire-marshal work here,
and I just had a little accident.</i>

79
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,572
I'm stuck on Ransom and 355.
The airport'll close...

80
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,806
...and I'll never get to Anchorage.

81
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:47,070
I mean, if you wanna talk,
we can do it on the drive.

82
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,766
Hey, Billy.

83
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,855
Stella's stuck at Ransom and 355.

84
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,763
She needs a ride to the airport.
Can you go get her?

85
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,070
Yeah.

86
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,402
John Riis needs me
for something...

87
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,606
...so Billy's gonna come get you.

88
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,675
Let me know if a day comes
when you do wanna talk.

89
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,707
What sick jerk would do this?

90
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:48,481
Every kennel. Every dog we had.

91
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,333
Did you fight with anyone
recently, John?

92
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:58,339
I'll kill them. I'll kill them.

93
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:01,532
This wasn't done long ago.

94
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:07,067
I'll find them. Okay?

95
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:14,913
You'll be okay, Malekai.

96
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:23,233
- Where have you been?
- I couldn't find the damn car keys.

97
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:27,489
Then I was like, "Wait, was that
Rogers and 355 or Ransom?"

98
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,661
- And then...
- Yeah, never mind. Let's go.

99
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,348
It would be a lot easier
if you just played, Grandma.

100
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:40,708
Oh, I don't really care for those sort of
games, if you wanna know the truth.

101
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,589
Try your brother.

102
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:47,715
- What?
- Eben, do you wanna play?

103
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,266
I can't right now, Jake. Sorry.

104
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,661
While you were busy with John Riis,
Carter and Wilson called...

105
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,407
...about a vandalism problem
at the Utilidor.

106
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,893
Thanks.

107
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:07,718
Call Point Hope and Wainwright.
See if they're having any troubles.

108
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,611
No.

109
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:29,216
I am not trapped here for a month.

110
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,781
- There's someone you can bunk with.
- Don't start, Billy.

111
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:43,553
Peggy and me can put two girls in one
room. You'd have a place of your own.

112
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,100
I can't stay here. I've got bills
to put in the mail. My plants'll die.

113
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,281
It'll all work out.

114
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,576
Of course, the price
of staying at my place...

115
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:56,124
...is explaining to me and Peggy
just what is wrong with you and Eben.

116
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:04,966
Not enough time this century
to cover that, Billy.

117
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,366
Eben, how you doing?

118
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:32,987
- Good to see you.
- Hey, Carter.

119
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,947
Lord, it's gotta be
10 below out here.

120
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,215
- Eben.
- Wilson.

121
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:47,486
Can't your wife bring you up
a sweater or two?

122
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,364
Bring the whole tribe up
while she's at it?

123
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:53,477
They'll come when they're ready,
I guess.

124
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,294
So...

125
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,910
...I've found all kinds of garbage
in here over the years.

126
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:01,216
Blue jeans, bikes...

127
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:04,731
Sometimes I can yank them out before
the muffin monster chews them to shit.

128
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:06,757
The muffin monster?

129
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,285
I saw Wilson's helicopter logo.

130
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,756
Pulled that stuff out
before it got totally trashed.

131
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,925
You keep your copter
under lock and key, don't you?

132
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:29,599
Yeah, I put it in dry dock
when the tourists headed south.

133
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,797
I haven't looked at it for days.
They ripped out the throttle...

134
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,453
...the rotors,
half the fucking helicopter!

135
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,277
It's my life, Eben.

136
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:41,090
Why would someone
rip the hell out of my bird?

137
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:10,783
Hey! Stop!

138
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,242
Stop! Stop!

139
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:15,709
Who are you people?

140
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:32,994
No whiskey?

141
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:35,167
No rum?

142
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:36,992
Alcohol's illegal this month.

143
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:41,764
Folks have a hard enough time in the
dark without booze making it worse.

144
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,495
Well, forget about the liquor...

145
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,383
...Lucy.

146
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,071
Just bring me a bowl of...

147
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,987
...raw hamburger.

148
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:58,143
You can only get meat two ways
around here, frozen or burnt.

149
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:04,451
You don't bring me what I wanna eat,
what I wanna drink.

150
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:06,589
That's enough, pal.

151
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,805
Leave the lady be.

152
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:34,655
Hey, what do you say the two of us
go outside and have a little talk, huh?

153
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:41,534
Well, now, what's wrong with a man
wanting a little fresh meat?

154
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,438
Come on. You and me, let's go.

155
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,552
I'm taking you outside.

156
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,856
I would like to see that.

157
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,117
I would too.

158
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,661
But then Lucy'd have to clean up
after Eben kicked your ass.

159
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,796
It's more trouble than you're worth.

160
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:16,481
Hey, be nice!

161
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:20,389
Enough.

162
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,011
Stay down.

163
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,774
Fire marshal's office lets you carry
one of those things?

164
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:31,171
It's a funny thing, I never asked.

165
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,854
So you missed your flight?

166
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,869
That sucks. Where you gonna stay?

167
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:45,317
Billy and Peggy are putting me up.

168
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,742
Well, I'll talk to you sometime,
I guess.

169
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,259
Hey, listen.

170
00:19:57,383 --> 00:20:01,311
Look, maybe I'll come along
and say hi to Jake and Helen.

171
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,757
Bye, Luce.

172
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,689
We haven't seen vandalism
like this in a long time.

173
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:22,526
Don't you know how to take care
of this town without me?

174
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,629
Malekai totaled my car.

175
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:37,285
Hell of a day.

176
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,452
Just you wait.

177
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:56,673
Hey, Jake.

178
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,894
- Where are we going?
- I'm heading back to your house.

179
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,035
My landlady...

180
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:09,824
...doesn't want pipeline workers
keeping her up all night.

181
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,549
Denise is right.

182
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:15,076
- Let's head back to my place.
- Neither of you are getting me alone.

183
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,764
Neither!

184
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:20,257
We share, right?
None of us have to be greedy.

185
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:23,935
- Yeah, come on. We'll be good.
- Oh, you will?

186
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:27,550
- Where's the fun in that, Gabe?
- You bad little bitch.

187
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,539
All right, all right,
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

188
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:32,993
- Whoever wins, we go to his place.
- Good idea. Let's do it.

189
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,979
- Come on.
- Hurry up, let's get moving.

190
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,312
On three.

191
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,397
One, two...

192
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,028
Gabe?

193
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,805
Gabe?

194
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:49,662
Gabe!

195
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:11,198
Let me tell you what I got.

196
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,278
You don't work at the refinery.

197
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:18,557
You didn't fly in.
Somebody'd have seen you.

198
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:22,080
And you're definitely
not from around here.

199
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:24,166
How'd you get in?

200
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,595
All right.

201
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,031
We got a long time to figure this out.
Nobody's coming for you for a month.

202
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,941
Jake, come here a second.

203
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,837
What the hell is that?

204
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:13,053
It's pot. It helps her with her cancer.

205
00:23:13,254 --> 00:23:16,866
Didn't tell you I got a little greenhouse
at home. Didn't want you arresting me.

206
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,823
Now I know why you wanted
to live with Grandma.

207
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:24,673
No, I just thought you and Stella
ought to have some privacy.

208
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,659
Well, that worked out.

209
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,821
Computer's down.

210
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,689
I'll call Gus.

211
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:41,214
Strange.

212
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,518
The phone's down too.

213
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:48,006
Mr. And Mrs. Sheriff.

214
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:51,102
So sweet.

215
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:52,992
So...

216
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,987
...helpless against what is coming.

217
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,124
He's just trying to freak us out.

218
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,230
It's working.

219
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,301
We have more important things
to think about.

220
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:10,467
- I'll check on Gus.
- Check on Gus.

221
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,019
Bar the windows.

222
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,945
Try to hide.

223
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:17,187
They're coming.

224
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:22,972
This time they gonna
take me with them, honor me.

225
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:27,426
Yeah. For all that I have done.

226
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:29,916
"They"?

227
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:35,070
Who are "they"?

228
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:48,577
The generator's kicked in.

229
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,392
- I'm heading out to the cell tower.
- We have to stay here with him?

230
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:10,721
Sure. We'll keep an eye on him.

231
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,855
As soon as the lines are back up,
get Billy over here.

232
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,771
Stay on the walkie-talkie with me
until the power's back.

233
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:38,651
Gus!

234
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:49,987
Gus?

235
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:24,705
This is Sheriff Eben Oleson.
Stay in your homes, lock your doors...

236
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,908
...and load your firearms.
This is not a drill.

237
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,739
- Is your genny up and running?
- Yeah.

238
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:35,714
Anyone with a genny should go home
immediately, just to be safe.

239
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,244
If you don't have one,
you should meet at the diner.

240
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:41,121
I heard gunshots, Eben.
What the hell is going on?

241
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:42,875
I don't know.

242
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:47,907
Just go home.
I'll let you know when I find out, okay?

243
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:49,214
Okay.

244
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:54,341
Come on, guys. Let's go.

245
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:02,779
Let's just have dinner, John.

246
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,315
Please?

247
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,010
John! John!

248
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,415
- Ally!
- John!

249
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,362
No! No! John!

250
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:39,845
John!

251
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,764
John!

252
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,813
No!

253
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,740
John!

254
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,436
Ally! Ally!

255
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:00,962
- John! John!
- Ally!

256
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,270
- Oh, my God!
- Ally!

257
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,088
- John! John!
- Ally!

258
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:08,188
Oh, my God. No!

259
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:12,893
No way out of town.

260
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:15,098
No one to come help.

261
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,244
- Shut up.
- Ignore him, Jake.

262
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:20,380
You can feel it.

263
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:26,910
That cold ain't the weather,
that's death approaching.

264
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:31,557
Who you think
they gonna take first?

265
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:37,952
The girl who thinks
a gun will help her?

266
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,277
The kid, sheriff's kid?
Or the old gal?

267
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,168
Shut up!

268
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,030
Yeah.

269
00:28:49,254 --> 00:28:51,741
Thank you for the plastique.

270
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:55,968
I can snap that apart
and pick the lock.

271
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:59,100
- No, you won't.
- Jake, he can't. Jake.

272
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,367
Jake.

273
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,792
You shithead.

274
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:16,736
Helen, get the first-aid kit.

275
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:32,032
All right, time to talk.
Who are you here with?

276
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:33,764
Who are you here with?

277
00:29:37,254 --> 00:29:39,425
Who did that to Gus?

278
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,745
You're a dead man.

279
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,954
Where are they?!

280
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:49,284
I don't talk to dead men.

281
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:52,639
I don't talk to dead men!

282
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:57,694
Well, if I'm dead,
no one lets you loose from here.

283
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,060
You're all dead!

284
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:10,178
I can take care of that for now,
but Doc Miller...

285
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:13,920
No. Wait till the power's back.
Call Doc Miller then.

286
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:16,637
This fucker doesn't deserve
anything till then.

287
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:27,739
Billy and I'll work our way
from South Street to the pipeline.

288
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:32,900
His friends don't have
many places to hide.

289
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,426
I'll join you.

290
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,666
No, we got it.

291
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,691
Right now, you, me and Billy
are the authorities.

292
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:45,373
It'd be stupid not to take more help.

293
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:48,291
We got walkie-talkies. We'll be fine.

294
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:54,181
There's a Taser in the back.
If he gives you any trouble...

295
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,741
...use it. Okay?

296
00:30:57,158 --> 00:30:59,329
You drive. I'm riding shotgun.

297
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,227
- Stop the truck.
- What?

298
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:08,735
Stop the fucking truck.

299
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:22,816
I thought I saw something.

300
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:36,900
- Get in the truck.
- What?

301
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:38,527
Get in the fucking truck!

302
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,924
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

303
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,099
- Holy shit!
- Fuck!

304
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:16,252
What the hell was that?

305
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,724
Shit! What was that?
Where was that? Where was that?

306
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:37,151
<i>No!</i>

307
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,558
<i>- Helen!
- Help!</i>

308
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:41,507
Helen! Helen, come in!

309
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:49,948
Jake?

310
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,450
Helen?

311
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:54,529
Are you here?

312
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:59,104
Oh, shit.

313
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,787
They didn't take me.

314
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:22,757
Who did they take?

315
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,434
They didn't take me.

316
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:33,949
Did they take my brother?

317
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:48,290
Finish me off.

318
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,884
Finish me.

319
00:33:58,021 --> 00:33:59,396
Eben.

320
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:03,108
Eben, look at me.

321
00:34:04,454 --> 00:34:05,980
No.

322
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:29,500
The heads must be separated
from the bodies.

323
00:34:31,078 --> 00:34:32,866
Do not turn them.

324
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,855
We should have come here ages ago.

325
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,129
What are they?

326
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:12,831
We don't know.

327
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,707
- Wilson, I wanna go home.
- It's okay. Dad!

328
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,901
- It's okay.
- You keep shooting and they just...

329
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,731
They just keep coming.

330
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:24,707
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

331
00:35:24,902 --> 00:35:27,804
Maybe they're all coked up
on PCP or something, you know.

332
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,013
They don't feel any bullets.

333
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:39,012
They killed every sled dog in town.

334
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,384
They took Aaron and Gabe.

335
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:46,140
They killed my grandmother.

336
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:14,238
There is no escape.

337
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:17,860
No hope.

338
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:21,310
Only hunger and pain.

339
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,379
What are you? What are you?

340
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:27,709
- Lucy, is the back door locked? Okay.
- All locked.

341
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:31,098
Jake?

342
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:35,807
- Eben! Eben!
- Jake.

343
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:40,547
- Who the hell are these people, Eben?
- What do they want?

344
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:48,673
We'll figure that out when we
get you guys someplace safe.

345
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,968
There's a generator at the Utilidor.

346
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,743
No, that's way out on the edge of town.
We need someplace close to hide.

347
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:56,890
Now.

348
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:00,994
Charlie Kelso's attic.

349
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:04,067
It has a pull-down ladder.
You can't tell it's there.

350
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:07,268
He would've boarded up
his home before he left.

351
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,634
Which is exactly why
it's a good idea.

352
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:13,150
We'll pull down a board to get in,
then we'll tack it back.

353
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:14,847
Carter.

354
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:21,434
I want you to lead everybody
close to the buildings.

355
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:23,709
If you hear anything,
roll under a crawlspace.

356
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:27,324
Go straight to Kelso's attic.
I'll meet you there.

357
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:29,408
What are you gonna do?

358
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:35,586
I'm gonna load up with as many bear
traps and flares as a 4x4 can carry.

359
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,272
Something's gotta slow them down.

360
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:45,155
I'm coming with you.

361
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:48,601
Okay.

362
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:14,335
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

363
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:15,770
Shit!

364
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:24,484
Fuck!

365
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:28,129
Shit!

366
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,383
Eben!

367
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,637
No!

368
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:54,910
Go! Get out of here!

369
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,299
Shit. Shit. Shit.

370
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:07,098
Move it. Move it!

371
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:10,458
Come on!

372
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,162
Go!

373
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:28,413
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

374
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:31,482
- We gotta lose this thing.
- And go where?

375
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,889
We know a place.

376
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,332
Okay.

377
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:03,713
Go.

378
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:24,997
These seem to work.

379
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:29,794
It's well hidden.

380
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:43,970
Hey.

381
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:52,452
Two, three.

382
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,963
I saw them...

383
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:33,023
...feed on Grandma Helen.

384
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:37,986
They're like vampires, you know?

385
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:41,891
Vampires don't exist, Jake.

386
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:44,859
They don't fall
when you shoot them.

387
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,075
Hell, neither do I.

388
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:51,389
Well, I don't care what they are.
I just care what we do about them.

389
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:54,624
What are we gonna do about them?

390
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:00,539
We'll sleep in shifts.

391
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,759
We'll ration our food, and then
we'll figure out the next step.

392
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,742
We have two advantages.
We know this town...

393
00:44:12,452 --> 00:44:13,663
...and we know the cold.

394
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,413
We live here for a reason.

395
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,541
Because nobody else can.

396
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,915
Yeah, right.

397
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:55,743
You did all that I asked.

398
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:07,612
We will take care of you.

399
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:34,976
The things they believe.

400
00:45:54,724 --> 00:45:57,310
I guess it's good
you didn't want kids, huh?

401
00:45:58,597 --> 00:46:00,288
Imagine.

402
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:05,153
Where...? Where's Catherine?
Where's Catherine?

403
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:07,650
- Dad. Dad. Dad.
- What?

404
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:11,009
Dad, Mom died a long time ago.

405
00:46:13,445 --> 00:46:14,590
Isaac...

406
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:18,945
...you should go to sleep now.
You should go to sleep.

407
00:46:19,397 --> 00:46:23,226
That's right. That's right.
You should go to sleep.

408
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:27,550
Thank you.

409
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:47,226
They're ransacking
the Clarks' place.

410
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:49,891
They're tearing through
everyone's home.

411
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:53,444
- We have to move.
- When do you suggest we do that?

412
00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:56,707
Now, while we have the strength.

413
00:46:57,445 --> 00:47:00,543
Until we have some way to stop them,
it's suicide, Lucy.

414
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:03,229
We can stay here
until they find us...

415
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,339
...and they can kill us all,
or we can run.

416
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:08,029
Some won't make it,
but it's better than all of us dying!

417
00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:09,953
- Shut up!
- Doug, you should sit down.

418
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:11,391
Maybe Denise or Lucy dies...

419
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:13,793
...but that's okay so long as
you have a chance?

420
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:15,931
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:47:23,685 --> 00:47:24,830
Stupid.

422
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:35,490
Start a fight, that'll get us all
killed a lot faster.

423
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:47,099
Okay.

424
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:55,550
We go to the general store to get
supplies, then we go to the Utilidor.

425
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,234
But we'll never make it there
without cover.

426
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:07,997
We get there,
we can last the month.

427
00:48:08,676 --> 00:48:11,065
The next blizzard, we'll be ready.

428
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:22,403
Hello!

429
00:48:23,845 --> 00:48:25,732
Somebody!

430
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,599
Help!

431
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,162
Come on.

432
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,093
Help!

433
00:48:41,604 --> 00:48:43,644
Please!

434
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,682
Anyone?

435
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:50,273
Hello?

436
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,778
Anyone?

437
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:57,412
Help!

438
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,692
We need to get her in
before they find her.

439
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:04,510
- Wait.
- What?

440
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:07,485
Look at the rooftops behind her.

441
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:14,788
Please!

442
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:20,768
They're using her as bait.

443
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:49,667
Please.

444
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:53,219
Please, no. I tried.

445
00:49:53,412 --> 00:49:55,103
There isn't anybody left.

446
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,464
Please.

447
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:06,753
Please, God. Please.

448
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:09,981
God?

449
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:27,391
No God.

450
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:47,261
Eben.

451
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,116
Eben!

452
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,314
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

453
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:48,671
I've known Kirsten my whole life.

454
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,137
I'm going out.

455
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,163
Why we waiting?
While they're feeding...

456
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:54,298
...we could make a run for it.

457
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:56,890
- I can kill these things.
- We'll die in here otherwise.

458
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,783
Eben doesn't know what he's doing!

459
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,908
- Just move.
- Beau.

460
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,075
We agreed to keep
the bigger weapon here.

461
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:04,643
- Just move!
- We need you here.

462
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:16,285
Okay.

463
00:52:16,516 --> 00:52:18,426
Okay. Okay.

464
00:52:29,444 --> 00:52:30,906
John.

465
00:52:32,324 --> 00:52:34,364
How long have you
been under there?

466
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,509
I'm not sure.

467
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,489
Where's Ally?

468
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:41,693
Took Ally.

469
00:52:41,893 --> 00:52:43,583
Couldn't follow.

470
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,366
You're okay?

471
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:51,682
- The leg hurts.
- Okay.

472
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:55,423
I know a safe place.

473
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,232
I'm gonna pull you out.
But stay quiet.

474
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:02,843
Come on.

475
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:06,852
So hungry.

476
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:10,143
Yeah, we'll get you
something to eat. Yeah.

477
00:53:16,805 --> 00:53:18,397
What happened to you?

478
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:20,738
Shit!

479
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,524
Eben.

480
00:53:31,684 --> 00:53:32,764
Come on.

481
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:38,687
John.

482
00:53:45,924 --> 00:53:48,859
John! Stay back! Stay back!

483
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,245
John.

484
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,841
Stay back!

485
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:51,835
Are you hurt?

486
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:54,043
- There's blood.
- He can't breathe.

487
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,131
I'm okay. I'm okay.

488
00:54:56,357 --> 00:54:58,179
Where's your inhaler?

489
00:54:59,492 --> 00:55:02,209
- I lost it.
- Oh, shit.

490
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:11,234
John Riis became one of them.

491
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:07,872
Isaac.

492
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:14,746
No. Isaac.

493
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,151
I'm walking to Wainwright.

494
00:56:17,476 --> 00:56:19,516
It's 80 miles.
There's no way to get there.

495
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:22,877
- Just go back upstairs.
- Wilson.

496
00:56:23,076 --> 00:56:26,109
Come on down. We need to get
out of here. Bring your mother too.

497
00:56:26,308 --> 00:56:28,730
- Okay, we'll die if you go out there.
- No!

498
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:32,925
No. I'll die if I stay here. That's what's
gonna happen. Leave me alone.

499
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:35,419
What's she doing?

500
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:38,339
Just... Just keep quiet.

501
00:56:40,452 --> 00:56:42,721
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

502
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,258
Let's just go back upstairs.

503
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:50,656
Can l...? There's a bathroom?

504
00:56:51,332 --> 00:56:53,437
No... Okay, remember
you can't flush.

505
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:55,872
We'll just open the valve afterwards.

506
00:57:16,484 --> 00:57:19,167
Who would have thought
we'd make it this long, huh?

507
00:57:19,364 --> 00:57:20,574
We're ahead of the curve.

508
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,390
Every day they need more food.
They'll be back.

509
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,002
Dad? Dad?

510
00:57:31,204 --> 00:57:32,611
Dad!

511
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,689
No noise!

512
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:45,153
- Wait! You can't just rush out.
- He's my father.

513
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:46,752
Wait! No!

514
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:16,322
Stella, are you all right?
What happened?

515
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:19,331
Isaac went to Wainwright.

516
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,547
- Wilson went to find him.
- How long you been down here?

517
00:58:54,788 --> 00:58:56,577
Dad!

518
00:59:11,332 --> 00:59:12,826
Dad!

519
00:59:28,676 --> 00:59:30,083
Dad!

520
00:59:33,572 --> 00:59:35,394
Dad!

521
01:00:11,684 --> 01:00:13,757
I should've fought harder.

522
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:17,946
Kept Wilson here.

523
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:23,617
It's hard to stop someone
when their family's at stake.

524
01:00:27,203 --> 01:00:29,276
The things you'll do
to save your own.

525
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:33,311
We were like that once.

526
01:00:35,044 --> 01:00:36,669
Weren't we?

527
01:01:15,203 --> 01:01:16,796
It's gone.

528
01:01:19,172 --> 01:01:20,481
It's snowing.

529
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:23,805
As soon as it's safe,
we have to move.

530
01:02:37,763 --> 01:02:39,585
You four, canned goods.

531
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:42,594
Stella, Carter, propane, batteries.

532
01:02:42,788 --> 01:02:46,781
Jake, medical supplies. We meet
back here in two minutes. Let's go.

533
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,328
I promised my wife I wouldn't live
on these things while she was gone.

534
01:03:15,524 --> 01:03:16,833
She'll cut you slack.

535
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:43,135
Oh, God.

536
01:03:47,012 --> 01:03:49,401
I'm done playing with this one.

537
01:03:50,852 --> 01:03:52,794
You wanna play with me now?

538
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,584
Come on!

539
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:01,688
What?

540
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,536
Okay.

541
01:04:06,372 --> 01:04:07,746
Wait.

542
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:03,256
Somebody!

543
01:05:03,491 --> 01:05:05,150
Somebody get the ax!

544
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:24,060
She was just a girl.

545
01:05:29,476 --> 01:05:31,363
You did the right thing.

546
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,055
It's okay.

547
01:05:53,092 --> 01:05:54,619
Who was she?

548
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:57,950
I mean, does anybody
recognize her?

549
01:05:58,436 --> 01:05:59,810
No.

550
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,370
No.

551
01:06:04,771 --> 01:06:06,462
The whiteout's over.

552
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:19,166
We have to move.

553
01:06:19,364 --> 01:06:21,339
We can't stay here.

554
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,874
But the Utilidor's too far
without cover.

555
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:30,105
Eben?

556
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,515
Could we make it to your station
if somebody created a diversion?

557
01:06:40,036 --> 01:06:41,051
How?

558
01:06:44,387 --> 01:06:46,721
These things can't survive the sun.

559
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,435
What if we brought the sun early?

560
01:06:51,523 --> 01:06:53,182
Helen had that operation at home.

561
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:56,474
Yeah. She used an ultraviolet light
to grow the stuff.

562
01:06:56,675 --> 01:07:00,320
Yeah. I can run for her place,
let them follow me.

563
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:03,930
Hit them with the sun lamp while the
rest of you go to the sheriff's station.

564
01:07:04,132 --> 01:07:06,074
Just because something
stopped Bela Lugosi...

565
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:08,861
...doesn't mean it can stop
these things.

566
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:12,093
Why would they send that stranger
to cut us off...

567
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:14,396
...if they can handle the light?

568
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,802
What if it doesn't work?

569
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,366
It has to.

570
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:30,074
I'll do it.

571
01:07:31,204 --> 01:07:33,058
- I'm the fastest.
- Bullshit.

572
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:36,190
I weigh less than you
and I know Grandma's house.

573
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:39,802
- You're 15 years old. Forget about it.
- I'm 15. Right.

574
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:42,557
- You've got a wife. People need you.
- Jake.

575
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:45,436
I saw you in the back with the ax.

576
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:49,599
You think you're up to doing that
three or four more times?

577
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:53,026
You don't even think
this plan'll work.

578
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:54,877
Yeah, but you do.

579
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,016
I'm going.

580
01:07:58,627 --> 01:08:00,450
I'll see you at the station.

581
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:03,321
You'll need to start her genny first.

582
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,624
See you soon.

583
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:17,177
Hey!

584
01:08:32,131 --> 01:08:34,237
- Come on.
- Go, go, go.

585
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:40,321
Hey!

586
01:08:41,028 --> 01:08:43,166
Come on, motherfuckers!

587
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:47,098
Hey!

588
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:16,993
Come on. Come on.

589
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:47,903
Come on!

590
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:08,191
Let me check.

591
01:10:12,707 --> 01:10:14,747
Okay, quick. Come in.

592
01:10:17,956 --> 01:10:18,938
Come on, Stella.

593
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:28,891
<i>You there?</i>

594
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:34,147
Yeah. Yeah, it worked.

595
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:37,114
But they're gonna cut off
the power, so...

596
01:12:09,443 --> 01:12:12,607
<i>Stella. I got out.</i>

597
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:15,746
It's good to hear your voice.

598
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:17,532
<i>Don't wait for me.</i>

599
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,122
Please.

600
01:12:24,259 --> 01:12:25,688
Eben.

601
01:12:27,235 --> 01:12:31,545
Run for Rogers Avenue,
towards the trencher.

602
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:38,015
It's my turn.

603
01:13:05,155 --> 01:13:06,780
You do understand?

604
01:13:09,027 --> 01:13:14,079
What can be broken must be broken.

605
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:36,409
Fuck off!

606
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:24,824
Welcome to Barrow,
top of the world.

607
01:15:14,371 --> 01:15:16,542
You ain't gonna eat me.

608
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:56,893
When a man meets a force...

609
01:15:57,507 --> 01:15:59,678
...he can't destroy...

610
01:16:01,027 --> 01:16:04,289
...he destroys himself instead.

611
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:09,089
What a plague you are.

612
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,549
Beau...

613
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:39,167
And Doug.

614
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:08,795
Now there's six of us.

615
01:17:11,203 --> 01:17:13,178
Soon there'll be just five.

616
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:24,029
The little girl in the store.

617
01:17:24,995 --> 01:17:26,883
I changed.

618
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,754
I'm just so thirsty now.

619
01:17:35,587 --> 01:17:37,659
I couldn't tell you.

620
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:42,268
That photo's all I've got left
of my family.

621
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:48,926
Martha was taking the kids
to visit her mom.

622
01:17:50,947 --> 01:17:52,703
They were hit...

623
01:17:54,243 --> 01:17:56,283
...by a drunk driver.

624
01:18:00,803 --> 01:18:04,316
I wanted to be with them so much.

625
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:11,746
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

626
01:18:15,459 --> 01:18:18,623
But I know they're waiting for me.

627
01:18:22,563 --> 01:18:26,392
I can't live forever.

628
01:18:27,106 --> 01:18:28,862
I can't.

629
01:18:31,235 --> 01:18:32,184
Eben.

630
01:18:35,075 --> 01:18:36,799
Don't let me.

631
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:41,759
No, Carter.

632
01:18:42,627 --> 01:18:44,634
He told us what he wants.

633
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:07,357
Did you see that?

634
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,282
Yeah.

635
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:18,232
It's Billy.

636
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:45,697
Billy.

637
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,672
It's Peggy and the girls.

638
01:21:19,202 --> 01:21:21,504
I heard the screams.

639
01:21:23,075 --> 01:21:25,726
I didn't want them to die
like the rest.

640
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:30,297
I tried to shoot myself too.

641
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:32,920
The fucking gun jammed.

642
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:40,480
I shouldn't have signaled to you.

643
01:21:42,275 --> 01:21:44,380
I just couldn't stand
being on my own.

644
01:22:03,362 --> 01:22:04,988
You have a family.

645
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:09,599
You don't ever hurt them!

646
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:13,882
Don't ever hurt them.

647
01:22:32,162 --> 01:22:34,301
Maybe they tried for the Utilidor.

648
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:22,334
Gail.

649
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:24,896
Gail.

650
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:29,756
No. Stella.

651
01:23:35,139 --> 01:23:36,415
Stella.

652
01:23:43,843 --> 01:23:45,370
I'll meet you at the Utilidor.

653
01:23:52,771 --> 01:23:54,778
No, Billy, stay there!

654
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,080
Eben!

655
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,446
Jake.

656
01:25:34,882 --> 01:25:36,126
Jake.

657
01:25:42,914 --> 01:25:44,059
Stella?

658
01:25:45,698 --> 01:25:47,521
Gail Robbins?

659
01:25:48,035 --> 01:25:49,311
We don't know.

660
01:26:02,402 --> 01:26:06,657
It took centuries for us...

661
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,734
...to make them believe...

662
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:17,116
...we were only bad dreams.

663
01:26:21,154 --> 01:26:27,548
We cannot give them reason
to suspect.

664
01:26:28,674 --> 01:26:30,496
Destroy them all.

665
01:27:26,786 --> 01:27:29,153
Stella, this is Eben. Come in.

666
01:27:30,818 --> 01:27:32,411
Where are you?

667
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:39,356
Hello?

668
01:27:44,834 --> 01:27:47,868
- Hello?
- Stella. This is Eben.

669
01:27:48,066 --> 01:27:50,433
- Come in.
- Anyone?

670
01:28:15,075 --> 01:28:16,220
Eben!

671
01:28:47,459 --> 01:28:49,597
Billy. Bill, hey. Billy!

672
01:28:51,234 --> 01:28:53,242
- Go!
- No. Billy.

673
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:54,777
Shit. Shit.

674
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,839
Eben!

675
01:29:54,466 --> 01:29:55,742
Hey.

676
01:29:57,122 --> 01:29:59,359
I found these behind Carter's desk.

677
01:29:59,554 --> 01:30:02,522
Chocolates, vitamins and vodka.

678
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,424
Stella, come in. This is Eben.

679
01:30:07,906 --> 01:30:09,597
We should celebrate.

680
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:13,434
One day till sunrise.

681
01:30:23,938 --> 01:30:26,426
You did good
getting everybody here.

682
01:30:34,627 --> 01:30:36,055
<i>Eben.</i>

683
01:30:39,394 --> 01:30:41,085
Stella.

684
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:44,923
<i>Whisper. They're walking around.</i>

685
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:48,951
<i>I just had to hear your voice.
I've got Gail with me.</i>

686
01:30:49,154 --> 01:30:50,496
Where are you?

687
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:53,407
Opposite the Melanson's,
under a wreck.

688
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:07,611
- Are you okay?
- It's so cold.

689
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,723
We're freezing, Eben.

690
01:31:10,658 --> 01:31:13,887
I can see the car.
The wreck on the right.

691
01:31:15,394 --> 01:31:17,150
We're coming to get you.

692
01:31:20,546 --> 01:31:22,554
There's way too many of them.

693
01:31:22,754 --> 01:31:25,176
They'd kill us before we got to her.

694
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:36,631
We have to cut off
or they'll hear you.

695
01:31:38,018 --> 01:31:40,506
I'll call you back when it's safe.

696
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:46,298
<i>The sun comes up tomorrow.</i>

697
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:49,919
<i>We're gonna watch it together.</i>

698
01:31:52,098 --> 01:31:53,821
I'm so sorry, baby.

699
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:58,169
<i>I should never have left you.</i>

700
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:04,635
The street's filling up with oil.

701
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:13,662
They broke into the pipeline.

702
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:44,282
They're burning down the town.

703
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:02,015
Nobody will know what happened.

704
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:06,105
They'll just think it was
some horrible accident.

705
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:15,455
Next time they'll take out
Point Hope, Wainwright.

706
01:33:20,802 --> 01:33:22,624
Wait. Wait.

707
01:33:23,138 --> 01:33:26,269
This building's strong.
Can't we just ride it out here?

708
01:33:36,706 --> 01:33:38,615
He'll kill her if she runs.

709
01:33:41,506 --> 01:33:42,935
She'll burn if she stays.

710
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:50,621
You go out there,
won't they come after all of us?

711
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:04,861
Oh, dear God.

712
01:34:05,442 --> 01:34:06,969
Eben.

713
01:34:13,218 --> 01:34:14,679
Eben!

714
01:34:19,234 --> 01:34:20,510
Eben.

715
01:34:21,986 --> 01:34:23,513
Jake...

716
01:34:23,714 --> 01:34:26,813
...when they're all watching me,
get on the walkie-talkie...

717
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:32,990
...and tell Stella to run for it.
- What are you talking about?

718
01:34:38,274 --> 01:34:39,800
Eben.

719
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:45,081
When John Riis and Carter changed,
they were only bitten.

720
01:34:45,282 --> 01:34:47,649
They stayed who they were
for a little while.

721
01:34:50,562 --> 01:34:52,831
We can't fight them
the way that we are.

722
01:34:57,378 --> 01:34:59,320
Thanks, little brother.

723
01:35:01,698 --> 01:35:03,585
Take care of Stella for me.

724
01:35:09,697 --> 01:35:12,697
- Are you fucking crazy?
- It's somebody else's blood.

725
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:38,267
- He's one of them.
- How do we know he won't attack us?

726
01:35:38,818 --> 01:35:41,785
- Maybe we should stop him now.
- Shut up.

727
01:35:41,985 --> 01:35:43,262
Shut up!

728
01:35:45,794 --> 01:35:47,681
Nobody touches him.

729
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:55,004
I can smell your blood.

730
01:36:14,786 --> 01:36:17,241
You can't fight them all, Eben.

731
01:37:00,097 --> 01:37:01,853
Stella, it's Jake.

732
01:37:02,977 --> 01:37:04,887
Get out of there now. Run.

733
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,890
The one who fights.

734
01:38:04,994 --> 01:38:06,423
Go!

735
01:40:06,081 --> 01:40:08,415
What did you do to yourself?

736
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:11,608
What I had to.

737
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:16,544
Should I go after them?

738
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:27,321
- It's almost dawn. We made it.
- Eben.

739
01:40:27,842 --> 01:40:29,500
The dawn.
