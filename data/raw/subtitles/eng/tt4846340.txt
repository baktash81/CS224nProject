<i>YOUNG KATHERINE:
If the product of two terms</i>

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,882
is zero then common sense says

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,129
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,204
So if you move all the
terms over to one side,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,402
you can put the quadratics
into a form

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,720
that can be factored...

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,484

of the equation

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,561
to equal zero.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,856

your uncle Bob,
it doesn't matter.

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,881
Get us up there, Harrison.

187
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,247
We can't justify a space program

188
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,687

No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

He look enlightened to you, Sam?

195
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,241

he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,571
You know that, right?

199
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,444

they can get up there,

200
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,681

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,530
I don't know why.

of the capsule, Al.

360
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,056
Its lid is one third the
size of what it's going...

361
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,081
AL: I get that.

362
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,684
So, what do we do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

363
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,121
Turn it down?
No, Al. I don't think...

364
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,681
It was a joke.

365
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,929
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off...

366
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

367
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,841
I know.

368
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080

on that computer?

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,842
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

372
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,361
Does she handle
Analytic Geometry?

373
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,410
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

374
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
Yes, sir. I do.

375
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,570

Both.

382

Yes, sir.

383
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,491
I prefer it over
Euclidean coordinates.

384
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,051
Okay, good.

385
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120

Yes.

387
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,601
I'm also gonna ask you

388
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,761
to check
Mr. Stafford's math

389
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,285
as well as others' on this floor

390
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,441
from time to time.

391
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,601
I can handle that, Al.

392
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,649
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,290
But if that were the case

394
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,976
shingles wouldn't be flying
off the heat shield,

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,001
now would they?

396
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,889
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

397
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,041
for a moment?

398
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,650
Thank you.

399
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,811
Just to be clear...

400
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,850
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,844
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,843
asking us questions
about our work.

403
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,131
I think that's pretty reasonable

404
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,248
given we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

405
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,441
shooting him into space,

406
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,965

408
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
Because it's never been done,

409
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,321
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

410
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,564
It's gonna matter
to their wives...

411
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,285
to their children.

412
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,080

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,886
I'll be back with
the computers in a week.

536
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,804
Or out of a job entirely.

537
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,007
Oh, please.

538
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,816
You're better with the numbers
than anyone in there,

539
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,920
Katherine, and you know it.

540
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,136
Just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does...

541
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,650
you'll be fine.

542
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,689
And you, have some respect.

543
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,490
Get your damn feet
off my dashboard.

544
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,686
This isn't your living room.

545
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,804
I sound like a supervisor,
don't I?

546
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,530
A mean old salty one.

547
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,523
Riddled with authority,
no question.

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,764

550

MARY: Bye, Kat.

554
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,321
Good night, ladies.

555
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,720
See you in the morning.
MARY: Bye.

556
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,561
MRS. COLEMAN: Hey, baby.

557
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,801
Hello, Mama.

558
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,131
I was fixing to call
the National Guard.

559
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,921
Sorry, Mama.
New assignment.

560
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,889
Space Task Group.

561
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,042
Oh, my word.
That sounds important.

562
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,884
It's a promotion?

563
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,885
(CHUCKLES) It might be
a slight promotion.

564
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,011
But you want the job, right?

565
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,490
I think so.

566
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,404
It's a challenge, but...

567
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,648
It's nothing you
can't handle, Katherine.

568
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,250
Thank you, Mama.

569
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,361
(CHUCKLES)

570
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,921
Are they asleep yet?

571
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,724
They're pretending to be.

572
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,042
Is to look: What are you doing?
CONSTANCE: I don't...

573
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,884
They're not pretending
well enough.

574
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,961
Is to look: Constance!

575
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,929
Thank you, Mama.
Love you.

576
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,445
This is my bed.
No.

577
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,521
Get off!

578
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,011
Go back to yours!
I'm oldest! No.

579
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,376
JOYLETTE: What are you doing?
CONSTANCE: Get off!

580
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,640
What are you doing?

581
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,371
It's not fair how Joylette
gets to sleep by herself

582
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,210
because she's the oldest.

583
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,805
Yes, it is fair.
No, it's not.

584
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,456
JOYLETTE: Yes, it is.
CONSTANCE: Nuh-uh.

585
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,721
Constance, Kathy, sit.

586
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,042
Now, I understand...

587
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,925
you want to be grown
and have your own space.

588
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,768
So, whoever sleeps in that bed,

589
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,484
in Joylette's place...

590
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,404
will also do the dishes...

591
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,324
take out the trash...

592
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,448
and do all of Joylette's chores.

593
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,441
That's okay. Never mind.

594
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,329
Yeah, she's not so
terrible to share with.

595
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,401
(CHUCKLES)

596
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Okay.

597
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,171
Then don't let me come home

598
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,288
and find you like
this again, you hear me?

599
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,920
You're supposed to been
asleep a long time ago.

600
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,605
We just wanted to say goodnight.

601
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,331
You've been gone for 300 hours.

602
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,648
I know. I work a
full-time job now.

603
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,325
You all know that.

604
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,090
I have to be Mommy and Daddy.

605
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,522
I miss your father
just as much as anyone.

606
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,487
He's with the angels.

607
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,608
Yes, he's with all the angels.

608
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,444
And he's watching over us.

609
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,887
Every minute, okay?

610
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,441
That's why we have to be strong.

611
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,521
All right?

612
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,965
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.

Are the Russians fixin'
to attack us?

617
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,801
Where'd you get that from?

Okay, baby,
that's called a drill.

621

622
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,330
you practice safety

623

624
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,244
Truth is, we don't know
what they're doing up there.

626
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,491
No, baby.

627
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,803
But I'm going to do what I can

628
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,004
to help those brave men
get there. Yes, I am.

629
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,004
You could fly up to space
if you wanted to, Mama.

630
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,650
You could be an astronaut.

631
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,729
Did you draw this?
Yes, Mama.

Hmm, I think he's
smiling over here.

715
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,446
At you.

716
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,120
Well I'm not smiling back.

717
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,247
Yes, you are.
Oh, child.

718
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,163
You are all teeth right now.
I am not.

719
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
(MOUTHING)
Come over here.

720
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
DOROTHY: He's coming over.

721
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,576
KATHERINE: Now, why would
he be doing that?

722
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
'Cause Mary's waving at him.
KATHERINE: No!

723
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,096
Ladies, I'm not ready. It's too late.
Fix your hair.

724
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,121
Hello, Colonel.

725
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,406
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

726
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,696
That's Mary Jackson. I believe
you met her husband, Levi.

727
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,245
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

728
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,765
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

729
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,729
She's not married.
She's a widow...

730
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,087
with three beautiful
little girls.

731
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,241
So well behaved.

732
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,562
Angels on earth is what
we like to call them.

733
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,404
Dorothy, slice of pie?

734
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,085
I'd love one.

735
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,730
Excuse me.

736
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,056
You already have
a slice of pie...

737
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,081
Uh-huh.

738
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,411
I was just, uh, fixing my
three babies some plates...

739
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,806
Let me help you.

740
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Sure.

741
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,162
Fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

742
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,530
Pastor mentioned you're
a computer at NASA.

743
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Yes.

744
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,005
What's that entail?

745
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,601
Oh.

746
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,922
We calculate
the mathematics necessary

747
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,651
to enable launch and landing
for the space program.

748
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,321
(LAUGHING) That's
pretty heady stuff.

749
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,527
Yes, it is.

750
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,409
They let women
handle that sort of...

751
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,481
Uh...

752
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,001
That's not what I mean.

753
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,491
What do you mean?

754
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,603
I'm just surprised
that something so...

755
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,726
taxing...
Mmm-hmm.

756
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,325
Mr. Johnson.

757
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,647
If I were you, I'd quit
talking right now.

758
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,040
I didn't mean no disrespect.

759
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,566
I will have you know

760
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,802
I was the first
Negro female student

761
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,167
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

762
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,120
On any given day...

763
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,402
I analyze the manometer levels

764
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity

765
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,606
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

766
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,409
by cosine, square root...

767
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,608
and, lately, analytic geometry.

768
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,681
By hand.

769
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,771
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

770
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,689
Negro women
in the West Computing Group.

771
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,326
And we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

772
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,161
So, yes.

773
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,721
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

774
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,687
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

775
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,242
It's because we wear glasses.

776
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,890
Have a good day.

777
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,602
(BAND PLAYING)
(ALL APPLAUDING)

778
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,206
Scott, welcome to Langley.

779
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,686
Welcome to Langley.
Welcome.

780
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,204
Good to have
you here, gentlemen.

781
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,566
Thank you.

782
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,411
That's Alan Shepard,
U.S. Navy pilot.

783
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,403
He could be the
first man in space.

784
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,251
And that's Scott Carpenter
and Walter Schirra...

785
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,970
also Navy pilots.

786
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,885
All under 5' 11", 180 pounds.

787
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,644
IQ's over 130.
Mmm.

788
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,723
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

789
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,611
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,761
It's equal rights.

791
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,882
I have the right to see
fine in every color.

792
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,202
And that's John Glenn. He's
the only Marine Corps pilot.

793
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,888
Gentlemen, if we may,
much to see around here.

794
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,960
Well, heck, we haven't
shaken all the hands yet.

795
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,640
We have a fairly tight
itinerary, Colonel.

796
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,721
Ruth, he's fine.

797
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,216
He's coming this way.
Look straight ahead.

798
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,241
I'm looking right at him.

799
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,404
Ladies, I didn't wanna run
off without saying hello.

800
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,085
Seem to be in a big
rush around here.

801
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,163
The Russians certainly
aren't slowing down any.

802
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,924
They can't build
a damn refrigerator.

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,376
How the heck did they
beat us into space?

804
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,811
(ALL LAUGHING)

805
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,216
And what do you ladies do
for NASA?

806
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,811
Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

807
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,976
You can't get anywhere
without the numbers.

808
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,001
No, sir.

809
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,968
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.
Engineering.

810
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,576
And I'm proud as the devil
to be working with you.

811
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,761
Thank you, Mary.

812
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,841
John.

813
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,770
John, let's take it inside.
Yes, sir.

814
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,570
Guys.
Nice meeting you guys.

815
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,200
Thank you, Colonel.
Good luck, sir.

816
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,611
God bless you all.

817
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,806
Thank you. That's wonderful.

818
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,601
Thank you!

819
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,531
Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm

820
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,331
launch and landing for the
Redstone rocket test.

821
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,563
I cannot work on what
I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

822
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,801
It's illegible.

823
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,604
Those numbers have
already been confirmed

824
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,569
by two engineers in this
department and myself.

825
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,768
This is more or less
a dummy check.

826
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
You have one, we make it two.
Make it double, okay?

827
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,209
We gotta get it.
Just make it happen.

828
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,247
No one thought to measure
these things?

829
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,050
I'm afraid not, sir.

830
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,568
Well, would you like us to stop?

831
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,722
No. No, just...

832
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,806
Actually, no.
Just keep going.

833
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,451
In fact, use the big hammer.

834
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,601
Yes, sir.

835
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,856
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go.

836
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,881
Watch out.

837
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,921
Ma'am.

838
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,521
Our runner can pick up
your work, Dorothy.

839
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,164
You need to be working,
not walking.

840
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,608
Oh, it's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

841
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,444
Since you made the trip...

842
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,728
you can take that batch
over there.

843
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,289
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

844
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,487
You need something else?
Yes, ma'am.

845
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,976
I was wondering if you know
what they're building

846
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,001
over in the tech wing.

847
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,962
It's called an IBM.

848
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,610
A mainframe machine.

849
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,845
Apparently, it can
do our calculations

850
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,000
in a fraction of the time.

851
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,681
Hmm.

852
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,964
I guess that's good for NASA.

853
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,488
Hurry on, now. Best if
you do it in one trip.

854
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,841
(GRUNTS)

855
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,241
Excuse me.

856
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,441
Hi.

857
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,764
What are you looking at, Paul?

858
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,525
Is that correct?

859
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,961
Yeah.

860
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,807
Whose work is that?

861
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,883
I said, whose work is that?

862
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,484
Katherine Goble, sir.

863
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Hello.
Hi.

864
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,456
PAUL: How did you know
the Redstone

865
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,050
couldn't support orbital flight?

866
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,376
That's classified information.

867
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,401
It's top secret.

868
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,247
It's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

869
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,890
It's fine
for sub-orbital flight

870
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,088
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

871
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,241
and push it into space.

872
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,405
Numbers don't lie.

873
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,322
And you figured
all that out with this?

874
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,923
Half the data is redacted.

875
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,168
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

876
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,004
The distance from launch
to orbit, we know.

877
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,366
Redstone mass, we know.

878
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,408
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

879
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,410
And the speeds are there
in the data.

880
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,250
You did the math.

881
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,641
Yes, sir.

882
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,283
I looked beyond.

883
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,761
How do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

884
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,762
That's not math.

885
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,001
That data is not here.

886
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,804
Like you said, it's classified.

887
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,769
I held it up to the light.

888
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,291
You held it up to the light?

889
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,521
Yes, sir.

890
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,801
Well, there it is.

891
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,961

have to ask a question.

The same one

1114
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,656
I've been asking myself
all the way over here...

1115
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,727
which is...

1116
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,090
How the hell did we find ourself

1117
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,089

They're just outworking us.

1122
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,441
The reason I have to think that

1123
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,696
is because I refuse to believe

1124
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,290
that the Russians
are smarter than us

1125
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,965
or that they have
more technology,

1126
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,565
or that they care more.

1127
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,123
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

1128
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,646

1129
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,245

01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,921
as the U.S. Navy man
from New Hampshire,

1416
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,128
the first to touch the stars.

1417
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,001
And I, sir...

1418
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,686
I plan on being
an engineer at NASA,

1419
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,763
but I can't do that
without taking them classes

1420
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,604
at that all-white high school.

1421
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,091
And I can't change
the color of my skin.

1422
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,407
Sol have no choice
but to be the first.

1423
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,163
Which I can't do
without you, sir.

1424
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
Your Honor...

1425
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,966
out of all the cases
you're gonna hear today...

1426
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,646
which one is gonna matter
100 years from now?

1427
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,245
Which one is gonna
make you the first?

1428
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,201
Hmm.

1429
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,361
(CHUCKLES)

1430
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,084
Only the night classes...

1431
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,525
Mrs. Jackson.

1432
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,561
(YELLS)

1433
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,086
Yes. yes, yes!

1434
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,321
Yes!

1435
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,080
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

1436
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,656
How late did he say
he was gonna be?

1437
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,576
KATHERINE: Excuse me. No
more than five minutes, sir.

1438
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,090
Gus Grissom's coordinates.

1439
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,204
Uh, I'd like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1440
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,200
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

1441
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,449
An orbital launch with an Atlas
rocket is going to take time.

1442
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,404
Is there a problem?

1443
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,926
Mr. Harrison...

1444
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,330
I was wondering.

1445
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,289
Uh-huh. I've been
wondering my whole life,

1446
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,010
so you just spit it out.

1447
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,083
Well, sir...

1448
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,562
I would like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1449
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,776
This isn't about
plugging in numbers,

1450
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,006
it's about inventing the math.

1451
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,856
And I think you and I
talked about that, right?

1452
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,881
It doesn't exist.

1453
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,041
I can do it, sir.

1454
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,645
Do you have any idea
how exacting

1455
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,245
these calculations have to be?

1456
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,841
It's like shooting a sawed-off
shotgun from a thousand feet

1457
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,696
and getting that one BB through a
hole so tiny, you can't even see it.

1458
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,736
Okay, let me see
what you've got.

1459
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,841
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1460
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,488
How have the
Grissom numbers been?

1461
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,570
They've been spot on.

1462
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,480
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1463
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,696
But you run it all through
Stafford, you understand?

1464
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,721
Yes, sir.

1465
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,361
Thank you.

1466
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,289
Computers don't author reports.

1467
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,686
GUS: (OVER RADIO) CAPCOM,
<i>this is</i> Liberty Bell 7.

1468
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,761
<i>CAPCOM: Loud and clear.</i>

<i>GUS: Okay, it's a nice

1470
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,001

1476
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,683
<i>Gus Grissom

1477
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,366

1478
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,441

01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,685
<i>Unfortunately, the Liberty</i>

1480
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,881
Mama.

1481
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,801
I can't, I can't.
Mary.

1482
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,136
SENATOR PATRICK: Mr. Harrison,

1483
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,480
<i>taxpayer money
sank into the ocean</i>

1484
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,806
<i>along with your capsule.</i>

1485
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,961
<i>So what makes you think</i>

1486
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,849
<i>you can bring
John Glenn home safely?</i>

1487
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,001
<i>Let me say first...</i>

1488
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,480
<i>discovery is never
just for the sake</i>

1489
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,560
<i>of discovery, gentlemen...</i>

1490
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,762
<i>but for the sake
of human survival.</i>

1491
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,647
<i>And it will always
come with a risk.</i>

1492
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,322
<i>Whoever gets there first
will make the rules.</i>

1493
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,482
<i>That's been true
of every civilization.</i>

1494
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,651
<i>And so, I think
the bigger question</i>

1495
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,250
<i>for this body to consider is...</i>

1496
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,007
<i>who do you want calling
the shots in space?</i>

1497
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,643
<i>We have to know
what's out there, Senator.</i>

1498
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,891
<i>We have to touch the stars,</i>

1499
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,281
<i>if only to ensure
our own survival.</i>

1500
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,283
<i>And only a man can do that.</i>

1501
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,571
<i>We'll get John Glenn home safely</i>

1502
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,130
<i>because we have to.</i>

1503
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,327
<i>Because he has to tell us
what he saw.</i>

1504
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,882
The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

1505
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,324
But the capsule
didn't have enough speed

1506
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,920
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

1507
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,122
Essentially a triangle.
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1508
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,884
That math was known.

1509
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,560
That took Shepard, took Grissom.

1510
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,925
That cannot take Glenn.

1511
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,484
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1512
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,089
that can push us into orbit.

1513
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,369
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1514
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,969
Earth's gravity
keeps pulling at it

1515
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,771
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

1516
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,684
That's how it stays in orbit.

1517
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,127
Now, getting it back down...

1518
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,564
that's the math we don't know.

1519
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,641
Yes, Katherine.

1520
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,485
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

1521
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,563
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1522
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,281
That's right.

1523
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,410
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1524
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,164
at precisely the right amount,

1525
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,321
that's the task.

1526
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,481
Yes, Katherine.

1527
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,087
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

1528
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,682
to a parabolic orbit.

1529
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,881
Yes.

1530
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,722
That's the "Go/No-go."

1531
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,848
Now at this point,
it's a pin head.

1532
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,005
We bring him in too soon...

1533
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,810
He burns up on reentry.

1534
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,200
That's right.

1535
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,691
We bring him in too late...

1536
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,444
he's pushed
out of Earth's gravity.

1537
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,922
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time...

1538
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,448
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind...

1539
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,408
would alter the "Go/No-go."

1540
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,530
And we start
our calculations over.

1541
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,921
Yes.

1542
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,447
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

1543
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,604
Now this "Go/No-go,"
this has to be exact.

1544
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,807
Sam.

1545
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,568
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

1546
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,971
in current capsule data.

1547
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,690
Obviously, we know
the launch spot.

1548
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,761
Thanks.

1549
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,604
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

1550
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,409
where the Navy
needs the recovery zone.

1551
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,443
Then we work backwards
from there.

1552
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,727
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

1553
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,441
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1554
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
What, Katherine?

1555
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,165
If I could attend the briefings,

1556
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,402
I'd be more useful
to the project.

1557
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,403
Pentagon briefings
are closed door.

1558
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,404
Yes, but if we don't
have the information

1559
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,811
of the changes...

1560
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,961
we can't keep up.

1561
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,456
I need those changes
as they occur.

1562
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,640
As you said, it's a pin head.

1563
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,524
Katherine, that's the job.

1564
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,250
You asked for this assignment,

1565
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,402
so just calculate
with what you have.

1566
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,528
Or we'll find someone who can.

1567
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,287
Okay.

1568
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,929
Attagirl.
(CHUCKLES)

1569
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,602
What the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

1570
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,807
Who are you?

1571
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,883
I'm with
the West Computing Group.

1572
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,360
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1573
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,249
This is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

1574
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,176
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
trying to be helpful.

1575
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,441
BILL: Uh-huh.
Bill, we've got numbers.

1576
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,530
What kind of numbers?

1577
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,005
Well, I'll be.

1578
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,161
What's your name again?

1579
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,286
Dorothy Vaughan.

1580
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,925
Dorothy Vaughan.

1581
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,646
<i>Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.</i>

1582
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,405
Oh, this is all moot.

1583
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,403
We're altering the
window on the capsule.

1584
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,050
When did this happen?
Six minutes ago.

1585
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,651
The math is changing.
Start over.

1586
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,088
Sir, if I could attend the
briefings, I could stay current...

1587
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,730
Katherine, we have
been through this.

1588
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,881
It is not possible.

1589
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,616
There is no protocol
for women attending.

1590
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,801
There's no protocol for a man

1591
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,160
circling the Earth either, sir.

1592
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,851
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

1593
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,605
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

1594
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,160
accounting for
the window change, sir.

1595
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,520
I have told you this.

1596
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,120
Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1597
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,368
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1598
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,443
That is not the way this works.

1599
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,967
Paul. What's
happening here?

1600
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,282
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1601
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,521
And why is that?

1602
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,371
Sir, the data changes so fast.
The capsule changes.

1603
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,971
The weight and the landing zones

1604
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,565
are all changing, every day.

1605
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,961
I do my work, you attend
these briefings,

1606
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,041
I have to start over.

1607
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,523
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

1608
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,600
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

1609
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,090
Why is it she can't attend?

1610
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,456
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

1611
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,925
I cannot do my work effectively

1612
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,400
if I do not have all of the data

1613
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,647
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1614
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,456
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1615
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,164
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

1616
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,416
It requires
the highest clearance.

1617
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,456
I feel like I'm the best person

1618
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,640
to present my calculations...

1619
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,720
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
No, I am not.

1620
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,728
And she is a woman.
There is no protocol

1621
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,936
for a woman
attending these meetings.

1622
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,291
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1623
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,845
But within these walls,

1624
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,330
who makes the rules?

1625
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,005
You, sir. You are the boss.

1626
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,811
You just have
to act like one. Sir.

1627
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,321
You keep quiet.

1628
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,281

Come on.

01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,856
We have a

1639

Get her a chair, please.
Yes, sir.

Let's discuss a landing zone.

1643
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,681
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

1644
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,127
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

1645
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,321
Outside of that

1646
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,209
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1647
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,647
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

1648
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,160
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

1649
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,966
With all due respect,

1650
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,809
our capsule's being

1655
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,086
into low space orbit.

1656
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,360
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

(ALL LAUGH)

1658
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,880
Okay.

1659
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,365
So we have the vehicle's speed,

1660
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,566
the launch window...

1661
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,370
and for argument's sake,
the landing zone

1662
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,726
is the Bahamas.

1663
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,609
Should be enough
to figure the "Go/No-go"?

1664
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,250
Yeah, in theory, sir.

1665
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,004
We need to be past
theory at this point.

1666
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,850
We'll be able to
calculate a "Go/No-go"

1667
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,445

that's the Bahamas...

1777
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,562
I imagine it's the same
as teaching a man.

<i>KATHERINE: The problem...</i>

1784
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,449
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit

1785
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,085
to a parabolic orbit.

1786
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,241
There's no mathematical
formula for that.

1787
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,886
Because we can calculate
launch and landing...

1788
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,405
but without this conversion

1789
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,927
the capsule stays in orbit,
we can't bring it back home.

1790
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,120

about this all wrong.

01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,730
Maybe it's not new math at all.

1793
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,444
It could be old math.

1794
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,727
Something that looks
at the problem numerically,

1795
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,370
and not theoretically.

Affirmative, CAPCOM.
