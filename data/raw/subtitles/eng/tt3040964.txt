1
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,598
<i>Many strange tales
are told of this Jungle...</i>

2
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,641
<i>but none so strange...</i>

3
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,062
<i>as the tale of the cub we call Mowgli.</i>

4
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,886
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.

5
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,310
Yeah, but if that branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

6
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,317
Crossing upwind,
breaking from your numbers.

7
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,007
If you can't learn to run with the Pack...

8
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,634
one of these days,
you'll be someone's dinner.

9
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,968
- How'd we do?
- Not Mowgli, again.

10
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,552
- He's never gonna make the Council.
- Let's go!

11
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,583
Race you to the top!

12
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,745
It was higher ground.

13
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,077
Wolves don't hide in trees.

14
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,691
I can't keep up with them, Bagheera.

15
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,576
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.

16
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,086
It was a dead tree.

17
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,584
How was I supposed to know
it was dead?

18
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,874
It had a fig vine.

19
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,965
Any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it.

20
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,131
- These are things a wolf must know.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,392
But if the branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

22
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,220
I realise you weren't born a wolf...

23
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,264
but couldn't you at least act like one?

24
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,902
<i>When I found him...</i>

25
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,654
<i>many years ago...</i>

26
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,613
<i>he was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.</i>

27
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,277
Get the deer!

28
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,572
<i>If he
was going to survive...</i>

29
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,283
<i>I knew he needed a people.</i>

30
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,247
<i>A people to protect him.</i>

31
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,209
<i>That's why I entrusted him
to the wolves.</i>

32
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,256
Look well, wolves.

33
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,015
<i>Akela was
a just and noble leader.</i>

34
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,519
<i>He allowed Mowgli to dwell
among them, all those years.</i>

35
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,649
<i>The trouble was, wolves grew so fast...</i>

36
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,360
<i>and Mowgli...</i>

37
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,146
<i>let's just say he liked to take his time.</i>

38
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,484
Mowgli, pick me up high!

39
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,195
- My turn!
- Stop. Not now.

40
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,531
<i>It was Raksha
who raised him.</i>

41
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,697
<i>She was the only mother he ever knew.</i>

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,767
- Come on, let's play!
- I don't feel like playing, Gray.

43
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,999
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.

44
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,995
Let's go chase some mice.

45
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,962
How did it go?

46
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,126
Caught me again.

47
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,803
If it's meant to be...

48
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,885
it will be.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,175
Let me hear the Law.

50
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,594
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

51
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,310
"as old and as true as the sky.

52
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,895
"The Wolf that keeps it will prosper...

53
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,811
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

54
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,526
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

55
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,032
"the Law runneth over and back.

56
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,740
"For the strength of the Pack
is the Wolf...

57
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,372
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

58
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,895
<i>Soon,
the rain ceased to fall</i>

59
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,854
<i>and the dry season arrived.</i>

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,286
<i>Heat crept through the Jungle...</i>

61
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,822
<i>turning it yellow...</i>

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,240
<i>then brown...</i>

63
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,783
<i>then black.</i>

64
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,670
<i>But that year...</i>

65
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,833
<i>was the driest season
that anyone could remember.</i>

66
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,171
<i>Even the mohwa didn't flower.</i>

67
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,057
My leaf.

68
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,640
This is mine. Mine, mine, mine.

69
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,227
There's a rock. That's mud. That's mud.

70
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,857
There's a rock. That's my rock.

71
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,688
That's my rock.
Nobody touches my rock.

72
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,275
There's another rock.
Two rocks. Three rocks.

73
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,279
Peace Rock? Peace Rock!

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,901
It's the Truce! The Water Truce!

75
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,120
It's the Water Truce!

76
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,078
<i>It had been
many, many years</i>

77
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,159
<i>since the Peace Rock was revealed...</i>

78
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,162
<i>and the Water Truce was called.</i>

79
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,783
<i>Hunting at the riverbank</i>

80
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,951
<i>was now forbidden...</i>

81
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,638
<i>because, by Law of the Jungle,
drinking comes before eating.</i>

82
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,895
<i>So, you could come to the Peace Rock,
on a day like this...</i>

83
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,148
<i>and find all people side-by-side.</i>

84
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,788
Don't forget.

85
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,908
No hunting.

86
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,999
Playing only.

87
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,581
Playing, only. I got it, <i>ami.</i>

88
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,085
And remember...

89
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,793
not everyone here has seen
a man-cub in the Jungle before.

90
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,329
So, behave yourself.

91
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,380
Okay, can I go now?

92
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,757
Take the pups with you.

93
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,884
Wait for me!

94
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,593
Come on, Gray!

95
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,094
Oh, take a look at this guy.

96
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,935
Excuse me.

97
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,759
Sorry.

98
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,061
- He's walking on two legs.
- Don't stare.

99
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,471
Hey, look. A wild boar.

100
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,016
- And a rhino.
- And a mongoose.

101
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,674
Everybody's here.

102
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,652
Is that a peacock?

103
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,009
- Ooh, a stick!
- Oh, that's my stick.

104
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,636
- I like this stick.
- Seriously, that's my stick.

105
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,845
- This is my stick.
- No, that's my stick!

106
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,513
- Let go of my stick!
- It's a Water Truce!

107
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,698
It's a Water Truce!

108
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,866
Sorry.

109
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,449
My bad! It's involuntary.

110
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,579
I could pee on it.

111
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,290
Watch yourself, please.

112
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,079
Dad, what is that?

113
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,872
I think that's a man-cub.

114
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,042
What's a man-cub doing here?

115
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,366
Whoa. Don't forget the Truce.

116
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,051
I know the Law, bucks.

117
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,439
What is that?

118
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,904
- Weird.
- That's weird.

119
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,458
Mowgli.

120
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,420
What was the rule about your tricks?

121
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,582
It's not the wolf way.

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,421
No more tricks.

123
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,262
Chin up, little one.

124
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,014
We'll make you a fine wolf, yet.

125
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,098
What about me?
Am I gonna be a fine wolf?

126
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,387
Look at me howl!

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,725
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.

128
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,112
Oh...

129
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,126
Mowgli, behind me.

130
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,545
Don't leave my side.

131
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:02,216
Everyone comes to Peace Rock.
So many smells to catch up on.

132
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,605
But, um...

133
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,527
I can't help but notice...

134
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,190
there's this strange odour today.

135
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,695
What is it, this scent that I'm on?

136
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,282
I almost...

137
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,543
I almost think it was some kind of...

138
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,422
man-cub.

139
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,092
Mowgli belongs
to my Pack, Shere Khan.

140
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,555
Mowgli?

141
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,305
They've given it a name.

142
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,890
When was it we came to adopt
man into the Jungle?

143
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,895
He's just a cub.

144
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,351
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?

145
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,552
Shift your hunting ground
for a few years...

146
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,443
and everyone forgets
how the Law works.

147
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,656
Well, let me remind you.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,451
A man-cub becomes man...

149
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,416
and man is forbidden!

150
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,587
- What do you know about Law?
- Raksha.

151
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,214
Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power.

152
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,918
You've never known Law.
The cub is mine!

153
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,638
Mine to me.

154
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,880
So, go back to where you came from,
you burned beast!

155
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,770
The tiger knows who rules
this part of the Jungle.

156
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,769
I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here
and make threats.

157
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,478
Especially during a Water Truce.

158
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,949
No, I'm deeply respectful of these Laws
that keep us safe.

159
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,492
So, here's my promise.

160
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,161
Nothing lasts forever.

161
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,258
The rains will return
and the river will rise.

162
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,136
And when this rock disappears,
that Truce will end.

163
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,133
You want to protect him, fine.

164
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:14,185
But ask yourselves,
how many lives is a man-cub worth?

165
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,492
<i>How many lives?</i>

166
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,826
<i>Who could answer that question?</i>

167
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,198
- The rain!
- Rain!

168
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,369
- Rain!
- The rain!

169
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,412
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.

170
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,327
These quills
get stuck on everything!

171
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,877
<i>When the rains returned...</i>

172
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,381
<i>it was a question
the Council had to face.</i>

173
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,735
<i>They deliberated and they argued...</i>

174
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,574
<i>for many days.</i>

175
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,870
What do you think they're talking about?

176
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,757
<i>No one had ever
come between the Pack before.</i>

177
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,423
<i>But Shere Khan's threat...</i>

178
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,589
<i>was not to be ignored.</i>

179
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,391
Mowgli, you're not supposed
to go up there!

180
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,282
He's got to go.

181
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,996
Look at the skies.

182
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,288
Shere Khan may be heading here
as we speak.

183
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,039
Please!

184
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,541
I'm leaving.

185
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,338
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

186
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,506
Mowgli, go back to the den!

187
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,299
A man-cub belongs with man.

188
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,264
We raised him as one of our own!

189
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,092
- He'll have the boy, either way.
- Akela.

190
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,937
Maybe I can be of help.

191
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,473
The boy's right.

192
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,516
Maybe it's time he found another people.

193
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,352
- No.
- I'm the one who brought him to you.

194
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,647
And now I'll return him
to where he belongs.

195
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,106
I won't let you.

196
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,650
He's my cub!

197
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,198
We knew this day would come.

198
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,578
We are the only family he's ever known!

199
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,828
Raksha.

200
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,208
It's the only place he'll be safe.

201
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,127
It's okay, <i>ami.</i>

202
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,837
I won't go far.

203
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,673
I'll come back and visit.

204
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,427
Never forget this...

205
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,180
You're mine.

206
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,890
Mine to me.

207
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,144
No matter where you go,
or what they may call you...

208
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,728
you will always be...

209
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,435
my son.

210
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,857
<i>I wish I could tell you...</i>

211
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,565
<i>that the wolves
could've fought Shere Khan.</i>

212
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,568
<i>But this is not that kind of a tale.</i>

213
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,735
The turtles like me.

214
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,745
Maybe the crocodiles.

215
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,364
What about the rhinos?

216
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,407
They always let me hang around.

217
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,710
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up.

218
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,255
I don't think I'd be very good at that.

219
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,712
It's either the turtles or the crocodiles.

220
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,589
Which one do you think is better?

221
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,004
Neither.

222
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,843
What do you mean?

223
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,224
I'm bringing you to the man village.

224
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,604
What?

225
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,558
Bagheera, I don't know man.

226
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,848
You will.

227
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,501
You always said
we're not supposed

228
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,607
to go near a man village.

229
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,613
That was different.

230
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,365
Why is it different?

231
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,555
You always said, "Stay away
from the man village...

232
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,069
"because you might fall in a trap...

233
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,747
"or get eaten,
or get hurt by flying rocks."

234
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,578
I know what I said.

235
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,711
Whoa. Elephants.

236
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,293
- Bow your head.
- Why?

237
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,462
Show them respect.

238
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,431
The elephants
created this Jungle.

239
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,637
Where they made furrows
with their tusks,

240
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,968
the rivers ran.

241
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,146
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.

242
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,315
They made all that belongs.

243
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,565
The mountains, the trees...

244
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,772
the birds in the trees.

245
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,483
But they did not make you.

246
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,235
That is why you must go.

247
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,011
What if I live with the nilgai?

248
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,106
No.

249
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,806
Or the mongoose?

250
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,520
This is not a discussion.

251
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,979
But this is my home!

252
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,526
I don't even know what man's like.

253
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,937
You'll learn.

254
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,355
But I wanna stay in the Jungle.

255
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,068
Why do I have to go there?

256
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,404
Because the Jungle
is no longer safe for you.

257
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,579
You're being hunted...

258
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,032
by a tiger.

259
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,071
Only man can protect you now.

260
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,167
Whoa!

261
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,203
This isn't fair.
You're not giving me a choice.

262
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,108
There's a lot of stuff
you're not telling me, too.

263
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,622
Don't think I didn't notice.

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,560
You say you're taking me
where I came from...

265
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,133
but you found me in the Jungle.

266
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,670
Are you bringing me back
to the Jungle? No.

267
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,367
Why are you bringing me
to the man village

268
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,631
if you found me in the Jungle?

269
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,720
And why does the tiger
hate me so much?

270
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,806
Does he know me?
Sure seems like he knows me.

271
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,938
Down.

272
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,815
What? Now we have to bow
to the buffalo, too?

273
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,850
Listen to me. This is not a game.

274
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,894
You're gonna run to that ravine.

275
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,896
What are you talking about?

276
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,969
Go to the north,
where the sky glows at night.

277
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,073
I'll find you on that path.

278
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,731
Bagheera, I'm not taking one
more step until you tell me...

279
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,105
Run, Mowgli!

280
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,944
Run!

281
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,237
Gray, what's wrong?

282
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,371
Why don't you come outside and play?

283
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,124
What is that?

284
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,085
Why did he have to leave?

285
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,259
Gray.

286
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,295
We could've protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.

287
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,213
I miss him, too.

288
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,341
What's important is, he's safe now.

289
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,767
Get inside.

290
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,945
I suppose you know why I've come.

291
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,904
The man-cub has left the Jungle.

292
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,209
I thought I made myself clear.

293
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,541
I wanted him turned over to me.

294
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,461
We no longer harbour him.

295
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,297
He has left the Pack.

296
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,013
And where, may I ask, has he gone?

297
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,511
He's with his own kind now.

298
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,058
So, the man-cub has left the Jungle.

299
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,147
That's right.

300
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,900
You and I no longer have a quarrel.

301
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,985
And, most importantly...

302
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,491
we have peace.

303
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,075
I guess it's done, then.

304
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,369
Unless I can draw him...

305
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,875
back out!

306
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,839
Akela!

307
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,052
Have I got your attention now?

308
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,006
I didn't want it to be this way.

309
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,346
I made it so simple.

310
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,138
All I asked for was one thing,
and you denied me!

311
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,149
That ends now.

312
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,184
Spread the word.

313
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,109
Until I have the man-cub,
these hills are my hills.

314
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,695
You did not respond to reason!

315
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,909
So now, you will know fear.

316
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,368
Bagheera?

317
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,018
Hmm?

318
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,223
Hey, there.

319
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,354
Do you have a language?

320
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,360
You're kind of cute, I guess.

321
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,530
You want a bite?

322
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,456
Come on.

323
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,157
Come here. Come on, it's all right.

324
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,620
Don't be afraid.

325
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,669
Come on.

326
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,347
Hey, those are mine!

327
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,390
Hey, come back!

328
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,189
Those are mine!

329
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,480
Drop it!

330
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,377
Hello?

331
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,434
Who's out there?

332
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,731
Hi, little cub.

333
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,773
Oh, no. Don't be scared.

334
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,738
I'm not gonna hurt you.

335
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,903
I was just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.

336
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,072
There's no trouble.

337
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,949
Are you alone out here?

338
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,585
Mmm. That's not good.

339
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,421
We should never be alone.

340
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,417
I'm waiting for a friend.

341
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,426
He should be here soon.

342
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,967
I can stay with you,
until he gets here.

343
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,266
Would that be all right?

344
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,431
I'll keep you safe.

345
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,443
Just you and me, sweet thing.

346
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,064
Who are you?

347
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,035
Kaa.

348
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,248
Poor, sweet little cub.

349
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,214
What are you doing
so deep in the Jungle?

350
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,297
This is my home.

351
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,507
Don't you know what you are?

352
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,966
I know what you are.

353
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,846
I know where you came from.

354
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,432
You do?

355
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,483
Yes.

356
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,489
Would you like to see?

357
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,997
Yeah.

358
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,502
<i>Mostly, men stay in their village...</i>

359
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,205
<i>far from the dark of the Jungle.</i>

360
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,041
<i>But sometimes...</i>

361
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,709
<i>they travel.</i>

362
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,843
<i>And when they do...</i>

363
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,006
<i>their caves breathe in the dark.</i>

364
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,674
<i>They call it...</i>

365
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,519
<i>the Red Flower.</i>

366
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,397
<i>Man's creation.</i>

367
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,526
<i>It brings warmth and light...</i>

368
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,033
<i>and destruction to all that it touches.</i>

369
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,701
<i>Who is that?</i>

370
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,963
<i>The traveller, protecting his cub.</i>

371
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,821
<i>Shere Khan ended
the man's life that night.</i>

372
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,237
<i>But not before he was burned
by the Red Flower's touch.</i>

373
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,075
<i>He ran so fast, he didn't
notice the cub he left behind.</i>

374
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,136
<i>And that cub...</i>

375
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,422
<i>was you.</i>

376
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,119
<i>The panther found you.</i>

377
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,797
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

378
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,267
You want to stay in the Jungle?

379
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,482
You can be with me, if you want.

380
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,645
I'll keep you close.

381
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,482
Let go of your fear, now.

382
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,528
Trust...

383
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,163
in me.

384
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,738
Relax, kid.

385
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,190
No need to get worked up. Okay?

386
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,322
- Where am I?
- Uh...

387
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,529
This is a cave. It's my cave.

388
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,264
You don't remember
what happened, do you?

389
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,539
- No.
- I saved your life.

390
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,580
Yeah, I snatched you
from the jaws of death.

391
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,916
The coils of death, if you will.

392
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,955
And lucky for you...

393
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,215
your new favourite hero,
old Baloo, here...

394
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,718
just happened to be passing by.

395
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:41,889
Uh, no big deal.

396
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,179
Just tell me this.

397
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,928
Can you...

398
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,559
climb?

399
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,478
Yeah.

400
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,725
Then let's quit wasting time
and get on with it.

401
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,401
Get on with what?

402
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,896
Payback, kid. Payback.

403
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,023
What do you mean "payback"?
Payback for what?

404
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,235
You owe me, kid.

405
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,119
You owe me. You owe me.

406
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,290
Slow down.

407
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,202
- And you're gonna pay back.
- But, but...

408
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,457
Because that's right.

409
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,866
You're gonna do the right thing.

410
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,106
That's the right thing to do.

411
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,608
You're gonna pay me back,
because you owe me.

412
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,712
You got it?

413
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,541
Okay, here's our little task.

414
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,593
You see that golden stuff,
dripping down there?

415
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,394
That's called "honey."

416
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,434
All you need to do, little one...

417
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,064
for payback purposes...

418
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,601
is to just shimmy on up there...

419
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,316
and get me that thing up there
that's making that funny noise...

420
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,980
and bring it back down.

421
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,866
You're kidding me, right?

422
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,407
No, not really.

423
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,073
I can get killed
going up there.

424
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,457
Kid!

425
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,077
Kid, kid, kid. Try to understand this.

426
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,748
I'm a bear.

427
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,460
It means that I have to eat my weight...

428
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,669
every day...

429
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,459
for hibernation purposes.

430
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,170
I know I'm asking for a lot...

431
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,384
but I don't climb and you do.

432
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,096
Look, I really need your help.
Winter's coming.

433
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,262
You don't want me to go to sleep...

434
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,271
and never wake up.

435
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,059
There are a lot of bees up here.

436
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,893
Yeah, some.

437
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,358
But don't worry. These ones don't sting.

438
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,117
Attaboy!

439
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,407
Ow! I'm getting stung!

440
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,707
Okay.

441
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,623
I would've done this myself,
but I'm afraid of heights.

442
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,257
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

443
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,073
Why don't you mind your own business?

444
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,097
You can do it!

445
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,221
- He's just gonna run away.
- Not this one.

446
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,495
As soon as the monkeys get
stung, they always run away.

447
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,384
- He's not a monkey. A man-cub.
- What is he?

448
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,693
A man-cub?
Yeah! Could you keep your voice down?

449
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,013
I'm trying to concentrate.

450
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,358
- Everything going A-okay up there?
- Ow!

451
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,901
Oh, boy. Looks like you got another one.

452
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,441
- Buzz off.
- It's a man-cub.

453
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,093
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

454
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,403
- It's not a monkey?
- No, it's a man-cub!

455
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,444
You have never been
a more endangered species...

456
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,112
than you are at this moment.

457
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,490
You're doing an amazing job!

458
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,124
I'm getting stung!

459
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,913
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

460
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,808
- It's not a monkey, Fred.
- It's a man-cub.

461
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,365
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

462
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,047
- Can you believe it?
- Are you sure?

463
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,758
Would you please shut up?

464
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,297
Hey, up there!

465
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,632
Everything is
going fantastically, I see.

466
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,802
Ow!

467
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,889
You got it!
Believe in yourself!

468
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,271
- There you go!
- Ow!

469
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,936
Come on! Almost!

470
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,823
Yeah!

471
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,318
Yeah!

472
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,828
Oh, yeah!

473
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,660
Uh-oh.

474
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,786
Fred?

475
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,014
Oh, yeah, exfoliate me.

476
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,261
You said they didn't sting.

477
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,304
What do you call this?

478
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,436
How the heck did you do that?

479
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,692
Oh, those must have been females!

480
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,002
They look like males
from down here.

481
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,692
Females do sting.

482
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,732
Just put some honey on those.

483
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,197
- Honey? Really?
- Yeah.

484
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,785
You put it on, you lick it off.
You feel much better.

485
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,664
It's nature's ointment.

486
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,370
I put it everywhere.

487
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,173
Thanks.

488
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,547
Okay, so, we're even now!

489
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,166
Hold on a minute.

490
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,799
What's your name anyway?

491
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,798
We were never properly introduced.

492
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,884
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli?

493
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,516
Mowgli is a terrific name.

494
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,224
I bet you got that one
all to yourself, too.

495
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,898
Hey!

496
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,397
Mowgli, look...

497
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,058
I got a lot of gathering to do
these next couple of weeks...

498
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,648
on account of the hibernation.

499
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,609
I could really use your help.

500
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,068
You know, if you stuck around...

501
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,609
I can't. I have to go to the man village.

502
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,489
Uh...

503
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,116
For what reason, man village?

504
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,451
I don't have a choice.
There's a tiger hunting me.

505
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,241
Really? Why a tiger?

506
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,910
Because I'm a man-cub, all right?

507
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,415
Just leave me alone.

508
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,422
Hey! Mowgli, my friend,
my buddy, my pal.

509
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,131
Slow down a second, handsome.

510
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,466
Bagheera said I have to go
to the man village.

511
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,767
Oh, Bagheera! I know him. Sure.

512
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,518
You know what his problem is?

513
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,850
He always plays by the rules.

514
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,981
And, sometimes rules
were meant to be...

515
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,484
well, not necessarily broken,
but certainly bent.

516
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,020
And definitely reinterpreted.
Don't you think?

517
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,838
He told me to go to the man village,
so, that's where I'm gonna go!

518
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,903
Okay, fine.

519
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,763
You wanna go to the man village,
have it your way.

520
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,618
In fact, I'll do you one better.

521
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,654
I'll take you there myself.

522
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,664
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.

523
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,084
<i>Bare necessities</i>

524
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,176
<i>Forget about</i>

525
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,173
<i>Your worries and your strife</i>

526
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,839
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

527
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,349
What's that?

528
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,805
That's a song about the good life.

529
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,062
What's a song?

530
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,894
You never
heard a song before?

531
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,934
Everyone's got a song.

532
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,727
Didn't the wolves ever sing?

533
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,112
I don't know.

534
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,605
Uh... Oh...

535
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,320
We recited the Law of the Jungle.

536
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,993
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

537
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,496
"as old and as true as the sky.

538
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,497
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

539
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,375
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

540
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,830
Kid, that's not a song.

541
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,919
That's propaganda.

542
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,757
What's propaganda?

543
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,727
Just a little farther.

544
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,771
That's the man village?

545
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,612
Yep. You can always
tell by the Red Flower.

546
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,026
They do love their Red Flower.

547
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,119
The Red Flower doesn't seem so bad.

548
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,293
Yeah.

549
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,336
Let it loose, and it destroys
everything it touches.

550
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,506
Don't ever play with it.

551
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:55,959
You got that?

552
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,210
Yeah, I got it.

553
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,385
Good.

554
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,595
Do you think that's where I'm from?

555
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,103
Could be.

556
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,094
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?

557
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,565
I don't remember it.

558
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,732
All I remember is living with the wolves.

559
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,522
Why do you wanna go there?

560
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,688
Bagheera said I need a people.

561
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,656
Again, with the listening to Bagheera.

562
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,488
Hey, he's my friend, okay?

563
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,195
Now I don't even know where he is.

564
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,665
I can't believe I'm leaving
the Jungle for good.

565
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,249
May I say just one thing?

566
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,164
What I saw you do today,
I've never seen anything like it.

567
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,338
I've been trying to get
that honey for years.

568
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,969
But I used my tricks.

569
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,346
What tricks?

570
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,267
You know...

571
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,847
Everything that I built.
It's not the wolf way.

572
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,804
Who cares? "The wolf way."

573
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,472
That's the Mowgli way.

574
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,890
That's the Baloo way.

575
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,183
That's our way.

576
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,726
That's how we get things done.

577
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,145
I can't even imagine what kind
of potential you'd have...

578
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,147
if you had somebody like me
helping you out.

579
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,651
You say you want to go
to the man village.

580
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,654
I say, you could be a man right here.

581
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'll tell you what.

582
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,829
Now you know where the man village is.

583
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,335
You can always go down there,
whenever you want.

584
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,317
But I would personally appreciate it...

585
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,252
as a personal favour to me, personally...

586
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,133
if we just worked together,
just us, tricks and all.

587
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,463
I think it would be interesting to see...

588
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,802
just how much honey
we could accumulate...

589
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,342
before winter.

590
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,931
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen...

591
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,185
I will do.

592
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,144
And if it turns out to
not be fun for you...

593
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,276
I will walk you right down
to that man village myself.

594
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,404
Is that a deal?

595
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,648
Just till winter.

596
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,068
Just till winter.

597
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,336
Ami, wake up.

598
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,502
Pups?

599
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,296
They're up there.

600
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,934
The deer, of course,
take comfort in numbers.

601
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,067
They lack defences
most animals will have.

602
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,524
And if we're being honest...

603
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,281
they're not very smart either.

604
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,012
Unlike the mother crocodile,

605
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,276
who is a good deal more clever.

606
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,704
But the one you have to watch out for...

607
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,369
is the cuckoo bird.

608
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,207
Do you know
how the cuckoo bird survives?

609
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,548
By preying on a mother's weakness.

610
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:51,055
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young.

611
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,340
Instead, it sneaks...

612
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,469
its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.

613
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,136
So, when they hatch...

614
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,306
the mother bird is fooled.

615
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,815
She feeds them, nurtures them.

616
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,903
And do you know what happens
to her own chicks?

617
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,277
They starve...

618
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,657
and die...

619
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,283
from neglect.

620
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,946
All because a mother loved a chick...

621
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,825
that wasn't her own.

622
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,835
Come now, time for sleep.

623
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,972
I think they like me.

624
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,524
Why are you doing this?

625
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,481
He's gone.

626
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,441
Isn't that what you wanted?

627
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,482
I want him dead.

628
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,664
Once he gets word
of what happened here...

629
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,199
he'll come back.

630
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,119
And I'll be waiting.

631
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,176
- That's the first mark.
- Got it.

632
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,016
- That's the first mark!
- Got it!

633
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,357
That's the first mark!

634
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,528
Got it!

635
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,366
Whoo!

636
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,742
Yeah, I got it!

637
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,285
- Tell him to go to the second mark!
- Got it!

638
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,240
- Go to the second mark!
- Got it.

639
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,041
Got it.

640
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,983
Look for the

641
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,622
<i>Bare necessities</i>

642
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,878
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

643
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,462
<i>Forget about your worries</i>

644
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,382
<i>And your strife</i>

645
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,548
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

646
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,762
<i>Old Mother Nature's recipes</i>

647
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,727
<i>That bring the bare
necessities of life</i>

648
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,146
<i>Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam</i>

649
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,652
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

650
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,896
<i>Of my big home</i>

651
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,314
<i>The bees are buzzing</i>

652
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:56,743
<i>In the tree</i>

653
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,201
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

654
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,494
<i>When you look under
the rocks and plants</i>

655
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,656
<i>And take a glance at them fancy ants</i>

656
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,574
<i>And then maybe try a few</i>

657
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,995
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

658
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,671
<i>They'll come to you!</i>

659
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,340
<i>Wherever I wander</i>

660
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,256
<i>Wherever I roam</i>

661
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,920
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

662
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,089
<i>Of my big home</i>

663
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,508
<i>The bees are buzzing in the tree</i>

664
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,098
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

665
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,855
<i>When you look
under the rocks and plants</i>

666
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,625
<i>And then take a glance
At them fancy ants</i>

667
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,774
<i>And then maybe try a few</i>

668
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,652
<i>Mmm! Mmm!</i>

669
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,484
<i>The bare necessities of life
They'll come to you</i>

670
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,362
<i>They will come to you</i>

671
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,778
<i>Yeah, they'll come to you!</i>

672
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,289
<i>Come to you!</i>

673
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,539
Baloo, Baloo, Baloo... look.

674
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,287
Stay low on my back.

675
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,804
Come on out and show yourself.

676
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,480
Bagheera! Ah!

677
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,068
Mowgli.

678
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,314
Oh, I was looking everywhere for you!

679
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,646
I thought you were gone!

680
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,314
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

681
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,941
I can't believe you found me!
I was so worried about you.

682
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,653
I was lost, and I didn't know
what happened...

683
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,071
but then I met Baloo.

684
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,160
And then he saved me
from a giant snake!

685
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,912
And now we're working together!

686
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,001
Really?
That's a new wrinkle.

687
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,627
I didn't know sloth bears worked.

688
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,169
Come on, Mowgli, let's be on our way.

689
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,212
Wait!

690
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,428
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

691
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,343
Don't be mad, okay?

692
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,598
Why would I be mad?

693
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,330
Because you're always mad
when I do stuff.

694
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,436
You gotta promise
not to be mad this time.

695
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,189
Show me, then I'll decide.

696
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,024
Come on, check it out!

697
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,021
These are vines I use on the cliff.

698
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,941
I twirl them together to make
them longer and stronger.

699
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,905
See how strong they are?

700
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,412
You wanna see the really cool part?

701
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,323
It's inside. Come on, let's go!

702
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,954
Come on!

703
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,597
It's the honey stash for winter!

704
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,143
Have you lost your mind?

705
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,141
You said you wouldn't get mad.

706
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,561
Did you listen to anything
Akela taught you?

707
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,770
There's no place...

708
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,726
in the Jungle for these...

709
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,905
tricks!

710
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,405
You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.

711
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,073
But I'm helping Baloo
get ready for hibernation.

712
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,443
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle.

713
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:47,907
What are you teaching him?

714
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,661
Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot.

715
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,118
Listen to me, you con artist!

716
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,252
He may not know your game, but I do.

717
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,777
- He's leaving now.
- But I don't wanna leave!

718
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,416
You don't have a choice!

719
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,781
Why don't we all just
settle down for a minute.

720
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,091
Look, it's gotten late.
Too late to travel.

721
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,145
So, why don't we all
just have a little honey...

722
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,591
I don't eat honey.

723
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,933
No problem. I'll eat the honey.

724
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,766
Let's all get a good night's sleep...

725
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,580
and we can talk about this
in the morning.

726
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,275
Fine. But we're leaving, first thing.

727
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,073
Mowgli.

728
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,007
Where is he?

729
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,251
- In the pit.
- In the what?

730
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,754
- Is this your teaching?
- Oh, come on!

731
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,765
You know I'd never teach him
to mess around with elephants.

732
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,732
Hey, guys.

733
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,700
What'd I tell you? He's special.

734
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,868
I know he's special.

735
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,503
I raised him.

736
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,548
Then don't make him leave, Bagheera!

737
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,005
You gotta let him be what he is.

738
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,717
You don't understand.
The boy's in danger.

739
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,382
I know, he told me.
He's being hunted by a tiger.

740
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,846
Not any tiger. Shere Khan.

741
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,346
Shere Khan's hunting him?

742
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,523
Oh.

743
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,836
But if you send him back
to the man village,

744
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,895
they'll ruin him.

745
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,776
They'll make a man out of him.

746
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,547
We should send him back
to the Wolf Pack.

747
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,231
Who's their alpha?
Akela, he can protect him.

748
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,240
Akela is dead.

749
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,195
- What?
- Shere Khan killed him.

750
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,539
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy.

751
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,744
Nothing.

752
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,621
The only way we can save him...

753
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,957
is if he goes to that man village.

754
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,541
Please, Baloo.

755
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,124
You're the only one he'll listen to.

756
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,779
Hey, kid.

757
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,246
Hey.

758
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,873
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

759
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,869
Bagheera didn't think so.

760
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,629
Oh, no, I talked to him.
He was very impressed.

761
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:33,878
He was?

762
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,383
We both were. Yeah.

763
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,794
I've never seen anyone get

764
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,922
that close to an elephant before.

765
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,939
So, listen, kid.

766
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,223
I gotta talk to you about something.

767
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,891
What do you wanna talk about?

768
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,650
I've been thinking.

769
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,812
Now that your friend has shown up...

770
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,446
maybe it's time...

771
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,323
for you two to just mosey along.

772
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,995
Now it's winter...

773
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,827
and it's really time for you to go.

774
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,788
But I wanna stay here with you.

775
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,917
We're buddies, aren't we?

776
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,129
Huh? No, we were never friends.

777
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,464
I certainly never thought
of you as my friend.

778
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,801
You helped me get honey
and I don't really need you any more...

779
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,973
Do I have to spell this out?

780
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,395
I don't want you around any more.

781
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,704
I did it.

782
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,371
And that's about the hardest thing
I've ever done.

783
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,787
I know.

784
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,753
Go away.

785
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,553
Get away from me.

786
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,430
Stop it.

787
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,655
Get away from me!

788
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,069
Bagheera!

789
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,530
Mowgli!

790
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,377
Mowgli, hold on!

791
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,008
Bagheera!

792
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,100
What was that?
Where are they taking him?

793
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,764
This way.

794
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,769
Ahh! Ah!

795
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,114
Whoa!

796
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,785
We see you! We see you!

797
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,251
Come on, jump!

798
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,710
And watch the claws.

799
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,492
Gah!

800
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:08,826
Uh...

801
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,742
I'll take it from here.

802
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,449
No, I'm coming.

803
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,325
It's doable...

804
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,707
if I don't have to go too high.

805
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,458
Good. Let's get going.

806
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,578
All right.

807
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,668
A bird. That can't be a good sign.

808
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,426
Baloo.
Look at me. Look at nothing but me.

809
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,636
- Hmm?
- You're doing fine.

810
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,095
Just keep your eyes up high.

811
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,519
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

812
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,864
What part of the Jungle you from?

813
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,027
You, man-cub.

814
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,700
You come from the South, the North?

815
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,208
What part of the Jungle?

816
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,169
The South, I guess.

817
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,460
Southern Jungle, the Seeonee.

818
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,216
Beautiful, I hear.
I never been there myself.

819
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,723
So, tell me, you ever had
a taste of the pawpaw fruit...

820
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,350
down there in the Seeonee?

821
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,810
Some people call it the...
What's the word?

822
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,480
Papaya. Stolen words.

823
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,265
I say pawpaw.

824
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,356
Goes to the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the Jungle floor.

825
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,153
Try it.

826
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,036
Go ahead.

827
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,458
It's good.

828
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,166
You know who I am?

829
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,387
No.

830
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,009
I am the King of the Bandar-log.

831
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,601
Call me Louie.

832
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,946
I did it!

833
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,524
Well done, old chap.

834
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,870
He must be in there.
Follow me.

835
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,666
No, no.
We're on level ground here.

836
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,497
I'm in charge.

837
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:32,287
And I've got a plan.

838
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,883
You are a man-cub
who wants to live in the Jungle.

839
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,009
How do you know that?

840
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,472
Kid...

841
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,224
I got ears. My ears got ears.

842
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,055
You wanna live here?

843
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,641
You need a people to protect you.

844
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,806
Only I can protect you...

845
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,645
and I will, for a price.

846
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,314
I don't have anything to give you.

847
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,193
I think you do.

848
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,035
What?

849
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,451
Look around, man-cub.

850
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,112
I got everything.

851
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,031
I have plentiful food...

852
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,415
endless treasure...

853
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,827
command vast legions.

854
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,750
But there's one thing I don't have...

855
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,501
and that's the one thing...

856
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,041
you can give me.

857
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,552
The Red Flower.

858
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,673
I don't have that!

859
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,008
You're a man, aren't you?

860
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,473
That's what makes you a man.

861
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,980
You can summon the Red Flower...

862
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,937
and control it.

863
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,644
They told me not to go near
the Red Flower.

864
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,854
You know why they tell you that?

865
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,525
Because once you have it,
you rise to the top of the food chain.

866
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,536
Nothing in this Jungle can stand up...

867
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,246
to the Red Flower.

868
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,877
Please, I just wanna go.

869
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,792
<i>Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub</i>

870
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,961
<i>I'll make a deal with you</i>

871
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,051
<i>What I desire is man's red fire</i>

872
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,840
<i>To make my dream come true</i>

873
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,842
<i>Now give me the secret, man-cub</i>

874
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,683
<i>Come on!
Clue me what to do</i>

875
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,889
<i>Give me the power
of man's Red Flower</i>

876
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,899
<i>So I can be like you</i>

877
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,768
<i>Oh, ooo-be do</i>

878
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,609
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

879
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,867
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

880
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:30,997
<i>You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

881
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,961
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

882
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,122
<i>Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me</i>

883
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,046
<i>A Gigantopithecus,
would ever dream</i>

884
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,257
<i>I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub</i>

885
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,468
<i>But together we 'd have powers</i>

886
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,224
<i>All the Jungle's treasures, ours</i>

887
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,769
<i>I got desire, you got the fire</i>

888
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,429
<i>But the dream I dream takes two</i>

889
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,602
<i>So, oo-oo-oo</i>

890
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,110
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

891
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,935
<i>I wanna use that flame</i>

892
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,608
<i>Just the same as you can do</i>

893
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,365
<i>Oh, how magnificus it would be</i>

894
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,109
<i>A Gigantopithecus like me</i>

895
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,414
<i>Could learn to do</i>

896
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,781
<i>Like you humans do-oo-oo</i>

897
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,412
Just one thing we need...

898
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,703
to reach our full potential.

899
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,088
Bring me that Red Flower...

900
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,041
and we will rule this Jungle.

901
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,675
I will protect you.

902
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,803
And you will want for nothing,
ever again.

903
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,088
I can't!

904
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,008
You can't or you won't?

905
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,927
I can't!

906
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,307
You will!

907
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,975
Excuse me!

908
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,150
Anybody?

909
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:41,945
Excuse me...

910
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,186
am I in the right monkey temple?

911
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,192
Oh, my gosh.

912
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,359
Is that King Louie?

913
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,865
This is so exciting.

914
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,864
The legends do you no justice, sir.

915
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,664
You are truly enormous.

916
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,787
In the best way.

917
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,753
Look at all of that flesh...

918
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,758
just squatting there...

919
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,385
on an ancient throne.

920
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:09,671
How majestic.

921
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,806
Seize him.

922
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,388
Hey, hang on.

923
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,143
Can you just hang on?

924
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,181
I climbed a mountain to see you,
and I'm not a climber.

925
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,349
Just to be in your presence.

926
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,269
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...

927
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,529
Throw him off the cliff.

928
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,112
Wait, wait, wait.

929
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,696
I have no problem with that.

930
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,369
I don't have any problem with that.

931
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,076
I came up here without an invitation.

932
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,036
It was extremely presumptuous of me.

933
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,544
Let me interrupt myself.

934
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,689
I just gotta say...

935
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,546
you guys are so much handsomer
in person than anyone knows.

936
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,798
No one ever gets up close to you.

937
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:46,968
Why?

938
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,501
Because of the smell.

939
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,465
The smell is rough.

940
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,176
But it's not just, "Oh, look at me."

941
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,263
It's, "I got the brains."
You guys got the know-how.

942
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,390
You got the noggin.

943
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,125
You came up with this stuff,
with the thumb.

944
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,731
Come on, show me.
How do you do that? I can't do that.

945
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,019
Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish.

946
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,855
But I was hoping, and you may
not be open to this at all...

947
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,240
but I was hoping,
and once again, it's a dream...

948
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,110
but I was hoping that I might become...

949
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,153
a Bandar-log myself.

950
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,247
Gosh, I wanna be like you.

951
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,412
I am hitching my wagon to your star.

952
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:26,713
No one leaves!

953
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,250
I can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye!

954
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,944
We'll try to hold them off.

955
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,978
Where you going, man-cub?

956
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,983
Stay away from me!

957
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,523
You don't have anyone now.

958
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,906
I'm your only hope.
I can make it real good for you here.

959
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,486
Where else you gonna go?

960
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,318
I'll go back to the Pack!

961
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,157
I'll go back to Akela!

962
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,038
Akela?

963
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,573
Oh.

964
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:43,958
You didn't hear?

965
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,829
Shere Khan killed him.

966
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,337
Must've been on account of you.

967
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,590
No! You're lying!

968
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,808
Don't run away...

969
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,022
from who you are!
You hear me?

970
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,047
Think about it, man-cub.

971
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,845
We can rule this Jungle.

972
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,689
No...

973
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,013
Listen to reason.

974
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:04,614
Gotcha!

975
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,040
Mowgli!

976
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,604
If anything happens to that kid...

977
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,527
I'll never forgive myself.

978
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,439
- Bagheera!
- Mowgli?

979
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,743
Stay there.

980
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,901
We'll come around to you.

981
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,200
Is it true?

982
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,746
What?

983
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,333
Is Akela dead?

984
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,002
We were going to tell you.

985
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,456
You knew!

986
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,170
You both knew!

987
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,880
And nobody did anything about it!

988
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,340
Kid, just hold on.

989
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,180
Someone's gotta do something!

990
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,304
Mowgli!

991
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,856
There's no trace of him.

992
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:08,570
Where could he have gone?

993
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:24,634
Come on!

994
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:47,859
It's man.

995
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,364
He's come to the Jungle.

996
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,913
<i>Ami,</i> what's happening?

997
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,078
The Red Flower.

998
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,369
Everybody, get to the river!

999
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,552
Red Flower.

1000
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,555
Pups, come on. Stay close.

1001
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,113
Is that Mowgli?

1002
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,787
Shere Khan!

1003
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,704
Shere Khan!

1004
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,247
I'm not afraid of you!

1005
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,666
No one has to be afraid of you any more!

1006
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,300
No...

1007
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:01,183
I think they're afraid
of something else now.

1008
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,280
The man-cub is now a man.

1009
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,503
Gray...

1010
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,214
Always a proud day...

1011
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,796
when they come of age.

1012
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:38,636
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.

1013
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:42,303
I'm the one who saw your future.

1014
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,518
I saw what you'd become.

1015
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:53,777
Come now, use the Red Flower.

1016
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,488
Use it on me like your father did.

1017
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,203
Show everyone what you really are!

1018
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,340
I'm Mowgli of the Seeonee
and this is my home!

1019
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,676
That was the stupidest thing
you could've done.

1020
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,140
Now you have nothing.

1021
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,690
No claws, no fur, no teeth...

1022
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,731
And no friends.

1023
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,530
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

1024
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,033
"as old and as true as the sky."

1025
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,238
What is this?

1026
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,532
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1027
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,000
"but the Wolf
that breaks it will die."

1028
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,293
You fools.

1029
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:48,373
"Like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunk...

1030
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,082
"the Law runneth over and back."

1031
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,039
Fine! Rise up, all of you!

1032
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,837
You want to put yourselves
between me and the man-cub?

1033
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,004
"...and the strength
of the Wolf is the Pack."

1034
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,074
I will have you all
in my teeth!

1035
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,033
- No!
- Wolves, attack!

1036
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,246
Stay here!

1037
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,169
But I wanna fight with the wolves!

1038
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,884
- You can't fight him like a wolf.
- You're not a wolf!

1039
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,845
Fight him like a man.

1040
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,935
Now, go!

1041
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:46,938
Okay.

1042
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:47,980
We'll hold him off.

1043
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:38,399
It's time
we put an end to this.

1044
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,574
No!

1045
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,172
Dead tree.

1046
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,858
It's just you and me now!

1047
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,213
Break, break!

1048
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,932
You've got nowhere to go, man-cub!

1049
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,520
Did you think I would let you grow old?

1050
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:51,864
Either I'll devour you
or the Red Flower will.

1051
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,986
It's just a matter of time.

1052
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,164
How long did you really think
you'd survive against me?

1053
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:07,039
Longer than your father did?

1054
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,169
Longer than... Akela?

1055
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,607
I'm not afraid of you!

1056
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,621
Do you hear me?

1057
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,332
I'm done running from you!

1058
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,418
You stood your ground, old boy.

1059
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,257
You stood your ground.

1060
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,815
<i>Ami, ami!</i>

1061
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,990
My son.

1062
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,158
- Mowgli!
- It's Mowgli!

1063
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,074
Mowgli.

1064
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,446
Will you look at that?

1065
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:31,910
<i>And where they made
furrows in the ground with their tusks...</i>

1066
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,500
<i>there the rivers ran.</i>

1067
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:05,326
<i>In my years, I've seen
a lot in this Jungle.</i>

1068
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:07,571
<i>But that night...</i>

1069
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,365
<i>I saw something I'll never forget.</i>

1070
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,700
<i>I saw a little boy...</i>

1071
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:15,244
<i>without a people...</i>

1072
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:20,133
<i>bring all the Jungle together
for the very first time.</i>

1073
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,318
J ust a few more turns.

1074
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,118
I'm going high!

1075
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:45,359
Stay low.

1076
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,576
He never listens.

1077
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,261
Gotcha!

1078
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:03,505
- Come on, Mowgli.
- You went in the tree.

1079
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,949
- That wasn't fair.
- We almost made it.

1080
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:05,973
You guys...

1081
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,432
are going too fast.

1082
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:11,968
Anybody ever teach you how to jog?

1083
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:15,104
You went high when everyone else
stayed on the trail.

1084
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,774
- But that's what you do.
- Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.

1085
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,900
- Next time, stay together.
- Come on, guys.

1086
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,730
"For the strength of the Pack is the..."

1087
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,531
- Wolf.
- "Wolf...

1088
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,695
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

1089
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,283
Mowgli's back!

1090
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,205
Hey, Mowgli! Wait for us.

1091
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:39,166
Hurry up, guys.

1092
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:40,622
Hi, Gray.

1093
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,129
Look well, wolves.

1094
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:56,228
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

1095
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:59,357
"as old and as true as the sky.

1096
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,189
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1097
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,275
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

1098
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:08,283
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

1099
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:10,697
"the Law runneth over and back.

1100
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,703
"For the strength of the Pack..."

1101
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,200
This is nice up here.

1102
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,245
Now he can climb.

1103
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:26,384
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.

1104
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:37,095
I could get used to this.

1105
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,622
<i>Now I'm the king of the swingers</i>

1106
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,871
<i>Oh, the jungle VIP</i>

1107
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,707
<i>I've reached the top and had to stop</i>

1108
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,709
<i>And that's what's botherin' me</i>

1109
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,958
<i>I wanna be a man, man-cub</i>

1110
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,172
<i>And stroll right into town</i>

1111
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:52,720
<i>And be just like the other men</i>

1112
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,635
<i>I'm tired of monkeyin ' around</i>

1113
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,466
<i>Oh, ooo-be do</i>

1114
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,303
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

1115
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:03,390
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

1116
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:08,486
<i>You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

1117
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:13,237
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

1118
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,910
<i>Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub</i>

1119
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:17,578
<i>I'll make a deal with you</i>

1120
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:20,411
<i>What I desire is man's red fire</i>

1121
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,408
<i>To make my dream come true</i>

1122
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,661
<i>Now give me the secret, man-cub</i>

1123
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,747
<i>Come on!
Clue me what to do</i>

1124
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,586
<i>Give me the power
of man's Red Flower</i>

1125
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,258
<i>So I can be like you</i>

1126
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,090
<i>Oh, ooo-be do</i>

1127
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:36,096
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

1128
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:40,268
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

1129
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:45,099
<i>You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

1130
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:49,565
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

1131
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:29,984
<i>Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me</i>

1132
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:32,820
<i>A Gigantopithecus,
would ever dream</i>

1133
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,899
<i>I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub</i>

1134
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:38,238
<i>But together we 'd have powers</i>

1135
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,615
<i>All the Jungle's treasures, ours</i>

1136
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:41,825
<i>I got desire</i>

1137
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:42,958
<i>You got the fire</i>

1138
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,786
<i>But the dream I dream takes two</i>

1139
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:46,667
<i>So, oo-oo-oo</i>

1140
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,375
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

1141
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,122
<i>I wanna use that flame</i>

1142
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:53,708
<i>Just the same as you can do</i>

1143
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,177
<i>Oh, how magnificus it would be</i>

1144
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,554
<i>A Gigantopithecus like me</i>

1145
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,173
<i>Could learn to do</i>

1146
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:03,301
<i>Like you humans do-oo-oo</i>

1147
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:07,685
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

1148
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,694
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like me-ee-ee</i>

1149
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:27,158
<i>Trust in me</i>

1150
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:31,379
<i>Just in me</i>

1151
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,255
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

1152
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:41,093
<i>Trust in me</i>

1153
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:45,226
<i>You can sleep</i>

1154
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:50,353
<i>Safe and sound</i>

1155
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:57,440
<i>Knowing I am around</i>

1156
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:04,696
<i>Slip into silent slumber</i>

1157
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:09,743
<i>Sail on a silver mist</i>

1158
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:12,958
<i>Slowly and surely your senses</i>

1159
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:17,925
<i>Will cease to resist</i>

1160
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:22,384
<i>Just relax</i>

1161
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:27,261
<i>Be at rest</i>

1162
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:31,431
<i>Like a bird</i>

1163
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:35,769
<i>In a nest</i>

1164
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:40,903
<i>Trust in me</i>

1165
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:45,116
<i>Just in me</i>

1166
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:49,749
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

1167
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:53,954
<i>And trust in me</i>

1168
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:16,602
<i>Trust in me</i>

1169
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:21,147
<i>Just in me</i>

1170
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,152
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

1171
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:31,204
<i>And trust in me</i>

1172
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,981
<i>Yeah</i>

1173
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:07,694
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

1174
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:11,038
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

1175
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,082
<i>Forget about your worries</i>

1176
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,667
<i>And your strife</i>

1177
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:21,040
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

1178
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:24,676
<i>Old Mother Nature's recipes</i>

1179
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:29,007
<i>That bring the bare
necessities of life</i>

1180
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:35,893
<i>Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam</i>

1181
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:40,317
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

1182
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,770
<i>Of my big home</i>

1183
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,527
<i>The bees are buzzing</i>

1184
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,324
<i>In the tree</i>

1185
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,574
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

1186
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,749
<i>When you look under
the rocks and plants</i>

1187
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,911
<i>And take a glance at them fancy ants</i>

1188
01:42:58,130 --> 01:43:00,337
<i>And then maybe try a few</i>

1189
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,924
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

1190
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,507
<i>They'll come to you!</i>

1191
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:11,553
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

1192
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:14,602
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

1193
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,271
<i>Forget about your worries</i>

1194
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,939
<i>And your strife</i>

1195
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:24,441
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

1196
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,819
<i>That's why a bear can rest at ease</i>

1197
01:43:27,993 --> 01:43:32,282
<i>With just the bare necessities of life</i>

1198
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:36,036
<i>So just relax</i>

1199
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,289
<i>In my backyard</i>

1200
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:42,959
<i>If you act like that bee acts</i>

1201
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,550
<i>You're working too hard</i>

1202
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:50,217
<i>Don't spend your time
just looking around</i>

1203
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:54,634
<i>For something you want
that can't be found</i>

1204
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:58,187
<i>When you find out
you can live without it</i>

1205
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:01,557
<i>And go along not thinking about it</i>

1206
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,810
<i>I'll tell you something true</i>

1207
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:07,025
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

1208
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,734
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

1209
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:13,027
<i>Will come to you</i>

1210
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:18,825
<i>Water, air, love</i>

1211
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:26,048
<i>House with a roof above</i>

1212
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:31,512
<i>Talking 'bout the bare
necessities of life</i>

1213
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:35,183
<i>Wisdom, understanding, sleep</i>

1214
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:41,939
<i>Good health
is something you must keep</i>

1215
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:47,233
<i>Forget about
your worries and your strife</i>

1216
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:53,864
<i>These are the bare necessities of life</i>

1217
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,554
<i>Yeah</i>

1218
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,563
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
