1
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,152
Separation at 04:29:45 Zulu.

2
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,360
It's down.

3
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,738
04:31:15 Zulu.

4
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,283
Twenty-one west, 85 north.

5
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,623
McClusky's Bar.

6
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,667
Hold on.

7
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,132
Thank you.

8
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,592
Hello.

9
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,343
Yes, it is.

10
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,764
Right. Be right over.

11
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,311
- Evening, Alfred.
- Good evening, sir.

12
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,396
- Evening.
- Evening, sir.

13
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,414
Come in.

14
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,124
- Hello, sir.
- Well...

15
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,001
hello, Jim.

16
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,587
- Here. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

17
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,340
- Pour you a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

18
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,094
I'm a bourbon man myself,
but when in Scotland...

19
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,929
Mists of the Scottish moors.

20
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,430
Does it for me.

21
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,349
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,643
Jim...

23
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,813
Just how much do you know
about Ice Station Zebra?

24
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,359
Just what's been in the papers.

25
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,195
Drift Ice Station Zebra.

26
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,574
British civilian weather station
up at the North Pole.

27
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,578
- They're in some sort of trouble up there.
- Trouble, yes.

28
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,540
They've been sending distress signals,
but too weak and garbled to make sense.

29
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,127
There's something that's gone wrong
up there, that's for sure.

30
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,506
Some kind of fire or explosion...

31
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,927
Several men killed, the rest of them
dying from burns and exposure.

32
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,971
- It's pretty rugged.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,266
And they can't be reached.
Not by rescue planes.

34
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,062
The entire polar cap is completely
socked in with an ice storm.

35
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,608
Might not clear up for days, weeks.

36
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,819
No chance for the survivors, I suppose.

37
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,240
There's a chance. See, you're
going up there to get them out.

38
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,534
Those orders will come
through normal channels.

39
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,996
- Yes, sir.
- There's more to it. That's why I'm here.

40
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,457
Those men up there
must be pretty important.

41
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,917
They're not the reason you're going.

42
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,295
They're just the excuse.

43
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,466
- Well, then, what is the reason, sir?
- Well, I can't tell you that.

44
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,801
But I can tell you this:

45
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,639
It is important, Ferraday. Vitally.

46
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,974
Well, sir...

47
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,436
if I'm going up there,
I don't know why...

48
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,022
- Your passenger knows.
- Passenger?

49
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:54,110
That's another reason why I'm up here.
To give you his orders in person.

50
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,530
Those won't be coming
through normal channels.

51
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,743
That's his name?

52
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,121
There's another name in there
that'll impress you more.

53
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,290
Second page at the bottom.

54
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,879
All right, sir.

55
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,547
I'm impressed.

56
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,174
Not enlightened...

57
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,134
but impressed.

58
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,054
My car's in the alley.

59
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,406
I'll just be a minute.

60
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,411
We won't send you up there
completely in the dark, Jim.

61
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,496
I don't know the whole picture.

62
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,708
But I can give you a few details.
Not many.

63
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,460
You'll have to try and get the rest
from your passenger.

64
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,256
Yes, sir. By the way, sir,
when do I meet him?

65
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,632
I mean, where is he now?

66
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,054
Bridge, control.
Main propulsion tested satisfactorily.

67
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,722
Bridge, aye.

68
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,268
Bridge, control, from the navigator.
Recommend course 210 after clearing.

69
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,063
210 after clearing, aye.

70
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,732
Bridge, control.
All alarms test satisfactorily.

71
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,484
Bridge, aye. Regard all alarms.

72
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,320
- Have them send the inner harbor chart.
- Aye, aye, sir.

73
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,823
Control, send up the chart for Holy Loch.

74
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,533
Harbor chart coming up, sir.

75
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,454
- What's the tide situation?
- Flooding. Slack ebb begins 2325.

76
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,223
- Lieutenant Walker?
- Yes, sir.

77
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,016
I'm Hansen, Operations.

78
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,394
Put your men down at forward hatch.

79
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,815
- Everybody up forward.
- Aye, aye, sir.

80
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,818
All right, grab your gear
and follow me, men.

81
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,002
They're young.

82
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,504
They all are.

83
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,806
Rescue mission,
seems a little odd to send Marines.

84
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,631
Here's our passenger.

85
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,655
Maneuvering watch is set, captain.
We're ready to get underway.

86
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,406
Okay, George.

87
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,918
What's the weather forecast
off western Scotland?

88
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,338
More of the same, captain.
Intermittent showers, state-three sea.

89
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,173
Winds, westerly, 8 to 10 knots.

90
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,258
- Very well.
- Captain.

91
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,054
- This is Mr. Jones.
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Jones.

92
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,058
- Thank you. I'll try not to be underfoot.
- We appreciate that. We're overcrowded.

93
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,228
Tell George to single up.
We'll be getting underway in a moment.

94
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,064
- Ed, we'll skip the trim dive.
- Sir.

95
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,025
- This way.
- Refreshingly informal, your Navy.

96
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,945
On submarines, anyway,
living as close as we do.

97
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,947
We operate on a first-name basis.

98
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,825
My first name is Captain.

99
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,662
Be it ever so functional.

100
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,166
- I'm putting you here with Mr. Hansen.
- Your operations officer?

101
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,752
I'll drop in from time to time
to make sure you're...

102
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,629
Here, captain?

103
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,172
Comfortable.

104
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,260
Here. Keep this with you.

105
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,721
This is a nuclear submarine,
as you know.

106
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,056
We'll check you from time to time
for radiation.

107
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,725
That's very kind of you.

108
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,185
You know, Mr. Jones...

109
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,231
it isn't every day that somebody
as important as Admiral Garvey...

110
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,483
flies from London to Holy Loch...

111
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,320
to personally hand me a copy
of somebody's orders.

112
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,322
What are you up to?

113
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,116
Isn't it there?

114
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,415
It does say:

115
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,418
"Mr. Jones is to be taken into
your fullest confidence...

116
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,671
and will be extended every facility
and all aid..."

117
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,215
That puts a great deal
of responsibility on me.

118
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,886
It's a stunning character reference too,
don't you think?

119
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,556
And it is signed
by the chief of naval operations.

120
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,186
You must be delighted to know
what a trustworthy fellow I am.

121
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,195
But there's not a word here,
Mr. Jones, about...

122
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,781
why, or your part of the mission.

123
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,533
- Question of explaining me to your men?
- No.

124
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,537
- But there has been some speculation.
- I see.

125
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,499
That door soundproof?

126
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,250
More or less.

127
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,794
Yes.

128
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,463
And...

129
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,052
is it true, captain, that aboard
United States naval vessels...

130
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,554
no whiskey is ever served?

131
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,646
I'm to extend to you every facility...

132
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,358
short of endangering the submarine
or the lives of the crew.

133
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,153
That could include
a pint of medicinal whiskey.

134
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,947
If you happen to be seasick.

135
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,116
I am. Habitually.

136
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,575
All right.

137
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,287
Now... about your mission.

138
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,125
I wouldn't insult you
by swearing you to secrecy.

139
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:52,755
I think the most expedient thing, since
you have your orders, is to obey them.

140
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,929
Short of endangering my ship
or my crew?

141
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,557
May I ask, captain,
when we'll reach the ice barrier?

142
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,017
Yes, you may ask.

143
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,152
Bridge, control.

144
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,071
Diving officer reports
ship rigged for dive and checked.

145
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,200
Captain has the word, control.

146
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,661
Sounding, 68 fathoms.

147
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,079
68 fathoms, aye.

148
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,665
- Go ahead and dive.
- Aye, aye, sir.

149
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,262
Dive.

150
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,815
- Hatch shut.
- Periscope depth, Ed.

151
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,234
Periscope depth, aye.

152
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,743
- All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds, aye.

153
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,752
- Answering ahead two-thirds.
- Very well.

154
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,879
- Bow planes rigged out, sir.
- Very well.

155
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,840
- Give me 15 degrees down.
- Fifteen degrees down arm.

156
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,802
- Blow negative to the mark.
- Blow negative, aye.

157
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,259
Maneuvering, control.
Injection temperature.

158
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,137
Injection temperature, aye.

159
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,681
Bring her down 10 percent.

160
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,366
Control, maneuvering.

161
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,076
Injection temperature, 47 degrees.

162
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,829
- All ahead one-third.
- All ahead one-third.

163
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,707
Answering ahead one-third.

164
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,251
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble, aye.

165
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,587
Sounding, 74 fathoms.

166
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,425
- Pump from auxiliary to sea.
- Pump from auxiliary to sea.

167
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,720
Pumping from auxiliary.

168
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,223
Coming on the track now.
Watch it. Watch it.

169
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,352
At periscope depth, captain.

170
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,520
Very well. Thank you.

171
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,080
We have an escort, Mr. Jones.

172
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,457
A Russian trawler?

173
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,586
The innocent and inevitable
Russian trawler.

174
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,636
Just happens to be in our neighborhood.

175
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,515
Packed to the gills
with radar, sonar and radio equipment.

176
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,392
Control, sonar.

177
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,435
Target bearing 195...

178
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,437
medium screws, no turn count.

179
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,855
No other targets.

180
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,274
Very well, sonar.
Try to get a turn count on him.

181
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,402
Turn count, aye.

182
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,282
You get a good diving fix?

183
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,244
Right, sir. We're putting it through
the inertial system now.

184
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,539
- Final trim at one-third speed, captain.
- Very well, Ed.

185
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,999
What's our target doing, radar?

186
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,586
Mark. Bearing, 195.

187
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,880
Range, 3000.

188
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,717
Looks like we have the beginning
of a temperature gradient at 50 feet.

189
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,303
Take her to 300 feet, Ed.
Hold your speed as is.

190
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,265
- No point in giving him a demonstration.
- Three hundred feet, aye.

191
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,143
Make it 300 feet.
Give me 20 degrees down.

192
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,146
Three hundred feet,
20 degrees down, aye.

193
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,316
Sir, this message just came in.

194
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,985
Thank you.

195
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,702
Attention, all hands. This is the captain.
A Norwegian freighter...

196
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,956
has just picked up another distress
signal from Ice Station Zebra. Quote:

197
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,250
"For God's sake, hurry." Unquote.

198
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,586
The rest of the transmission is garbled.

199
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,172
So somebody's still alive up there.

200
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,968
The last estimated position of
the British camp was 85 north, 21 west.

201
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,263
But we can't pin it down.
Their position drifts with the ice pack.

202
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,893
The United States and Soviet Russia
are making a joint effort...

203
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,519
to reach the survivors.

204
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,939
An ice storm has ruled out any chance
of air rescue by either side.

205
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:48,110
So we're going in under the ice pack.

206
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,112
One more thing.

207
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,615
We have with us a British civilian.

208
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,452
I'm authorized to tell you
his name is Jones.

209
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,121
There are classified aspects
to his mission...

210
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,707
which means it's
none of our business...

211
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,335
so let's leave him alone.
I'll keep you informed.

212
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,754
Pump 1000 from
number one auxiliary to sea.

213
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,882
One thousand from
number one auxiliary to sea.

214
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,510
- Pumping from auxiliary.
- Very well.

215
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,138
- Ready to relieve you.
- No machinery down, unexecuted orders.

216
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,766
- I relieve you.
- I've been relieved by Ed.

217
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,894
Very well, George.
How does it look, Court?

218
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,813
From this diving point, captain,
I would say our best bet...

219
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,400
for a quick course would be 287
until we clear the Hebrides.

220
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,654
Then directly to Spitsbergen
for a final departure fix.

221
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,573
Transit time checks
with our initial estimates.

222
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,952
- Come around to 287, Ed.
- 287, aye.

223
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,329
- Come right to 287.
- Right to 287, aye.

224
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,998
What's the time for arrival
at the ice barrier, Court?

225
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,001
- 1530 Thursday, sir.
- Thank you.

226
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,213
- Move it up to flank.
- Flank, aye, sir.

227
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,508
- All ahead flank, Kentner.
- All ahead flank, aye.

228
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,010
Answering. All ahead flank.

229
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,183
Come on.

230
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,316
- Captain, the scam is this guy's a...
- A what?

231
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,110
Spy?

232
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,279
Just don't get
too buddy-buddy with him.

233
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,072
No, sir.

234
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,503
- Simms.
- Evening, captain.

235
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,423
- Hall. Ray.
- Here.

236
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,675
- Kelly. Morrison.
- Yeah.

237
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,385
- Martin.
- Yo.

238
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,554
- Miller. Moore.
- Yo.

239
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,014
Smith.

240
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,058
- Attention!
- Carry on.

241
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,144
- Evening.
- Good evening, sir.

242
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,188
Lieutenant Walker, I'm
Commander Ferraday. Welcome aboard.

243
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,524
- Thank you, sir.
- These quarters are cramped...

244
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,236
- but it's only for a couple of days.
- We're comfortable, sir.

245
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,654
Good.

246
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,990
Anything I can do for you, lieutenant?

247
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,452
I think the men were wondering, sir,
if they could smoke down here.

248
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,205
Of course they can,
except when the smoking lamp is out.

249
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:10,419
You'll find chow onboard the Tigerfish
pretty good. That'll make up for this.

250
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,299
- Any other questions?
- Well...

251
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,426
Are the torpedoes armed?

252
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,053
Sure they are.

253
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,096
- Nuclear warheads?
- No. Torpex.

254
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,391
I'd say each of them
has no more destructive power than...

255
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,561
400 pounds of TNT.

256
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,313
Nothing.

257
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,148
Yes, sir.

258
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,776
- This is a nuclear submarine.
- That's right.

259
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,737
None of us have been
aboard a sub before.

260
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,364
Rest easy.

261
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,240
I have.

262
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,794
Urgent, Zabrinczski. Right to the captain.

263
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,629
Yes, sir.

264
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,846
Captain, sir. Message.

265
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,784
Mr. Jones.

266
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,036
You're in my bunk.

267
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
Mr. Jones...

268
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,878
I'm terribly sorry.

269
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,715
- Found him in my bunk, captain.
- Yes.

270
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,175
Woke me out of a rotten sleep.
Asinine reflex.

271
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,928
Idiotic. It won't happen again.
Endless apologies.

272
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,850
- Do you always sleep with that thing?
- Childish habit. It's your bunk? Sorry.

273
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,436
Considering your reflexes,
maybe we better take that.

274
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,105
No, captain. I have to be
tucked up with it.

275
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,023
Security blanket,
that kind of thing.

276
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,318
Good. This'll loosen the old
fiddle strings. Will you join me?

277
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,195
No, thank you.

278
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,573
Recognize these coordinates?

279
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,032
Yes, sir.

280
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,868
Tell Court to lay out a track.

281
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,703
Aye, aye, sir.

282
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,665
Some startling new development,
captain?

283
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,503
We've been ordered to a surface
rendezvous, 59 north, 4 west.

284
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,591
That's just off the Orkney Islands.
It's with whom or what we don't know.

285
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,094
And you think that I do.
Scout's honor, I haven't the foggiest...

286
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,556
although I assume it's more about
my end of the business than yours.

287
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,349
Happy days.

288
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,269
Mr. Jones, I deal with secret orders...

289
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,314
classified information,
almost every day.

290
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:40,235
- I can't say I've ever learned to like it...
- And I am very glad that you don't.

291
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,697
Leave that sort of thing
to the people who are trained for it.

292
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,240
Right, captain?

293
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,285
I still feel all kinds of a fool
about that set-to with Hansen.

294
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,454
It's what he called me, you know.

295
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,581
Out of a sound sleep.

296
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,125
- What did he call you?
- Jones.

297
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,544
Bad name. Bad connotations.

298
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,172
I once killed a man called Jones.

299
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,841
Not for that reason, of course.

300
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,344
- That's not your name.
- Isn't that obvious?

301
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,848
Actually, it's a code cover name.
Brilliant deception, don't you think?

302
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,851
Practically a revelation, coming from you.

303
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,812
Captain.

304
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,650
You've already guessed
that I'm some sort of sneaky bastard...

305
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,736
involved in some sort of
low skullduggery.

306
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,154
- Right?
- Right.

307
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,740
But there's no reason
for a straightforward...

308
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,743
up-and-up, out-in-the-open
fellow like yourself...

309
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,247
being involved more than he must.

310
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,832
I promise you this.

311
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,875
You'll know all you need to know...

312
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,002
as, and if...

313
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,671
the need arises.

314
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,550
Now, shall we keep
our mysterious rendezvous?

315
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,846
Why not.

316
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,319
Coming up to periscope depth
now, captain.

317
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,071
Very well.

318
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,490
Shift to red.

319
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,368
Raise the radar.

320
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,380
Nearest bearing, 087.

321
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,757
Range, 9000.

322
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,344
Contact, 195.

323
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,972
Range, 12,000.

324
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,724
Cruise now, sir.

325
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,893
Possible aircraft still approaching.

326
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,979
Contact, 237...

327
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,564
12,500.

328
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,776
All clear inside of 5000 yards.
No IFF.

329
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,236
Stern room, aye.

330
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,571
Sonar?

331
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,533
All compartments ready to surface.

332
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,327
Very well. Shut the vents.

333
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,376
- Vents shut.
- All vents shut, captain.

334
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,212
- Okay, Jon. Bring her on up.
- Aye, sir.

335
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,384
Surface.

336
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,375
Bridge, radio.
We are in contact with Bravo 43.

337
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,502
He confirms identification.

338
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,088
Bridge, aye, radio. We have him in sight.

339
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,982
- Secure the deck. Go ahead and dive.
- Aye, sir.

340
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,325
Forward head secure, control.

341
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,786
Very well, forward room.

342
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,130
Hatch shut.

343
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,716
- Take her down, Jon.
- Aye, aye, sir.

344
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,473
Dive.

345
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,831
Switch to white.

346
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,919
- Secure the radar.
- Secure radar, aye.

347
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,715
- David.
- Boris.

348
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,761
David, David, David, David, David.

349
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,222
Good to see you. Now, now, comrade.

350
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:05,185
I'd like to introduce you to a good friend
and associate. Boris Vorisovich Vaslov.

351
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,521
Damnedest anti-Russian Russian
you ever met.

352
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,397
- Good morning, captain.
- Morning.

353
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,900
Best-stocked man in captivity.
Helped set up Zebra.

354
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,195
Drop him off within 100 miles
and he'll walk to the spot.

355
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,073
We'll try to get you closer than that.

356
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,244
Chief of naval operations.

357
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:26,832
- You and Jones have the same friends.
- And the same enemies.

358
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,627
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Vaslov.
- Good to be aboard, captain.

359
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,923
Jones, why don't you take Mr. Vaslov
to the wardroom. Cup of coffee?

360
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,927
I would love a good cup
of your American coffee.

361
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,846
You old abominable snowman...

362
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:45,100
- ...I thought you were at the South Pole.
- I was, 48 hours ago.

363
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,609
- I'm Commander Ferraday.
- Captain Anders.

364
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,028
- Good to have you aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

365
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:02,367
Especially since it meant so much
to someone to get you onboard.

366
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,828
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.

367
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:09,166
Patterson, show Captain Anders
to my quarters. I'll join you in a moment.

368
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,750
- Thank you, sir.
- Excuse me.

369
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,627
Right this way, sir.

370
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,218
Right in here, sir. Thank you, sir.

371
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,324
Then from McMurdo Sound
to Christchurch, New Zealand...

372
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,576
and all by Navy plane.

373
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,747
You've been hopping around
like a little kangaroo.

374
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,373
Who is he?

375
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,877
- You do not know about him?
- Was he checked?

376
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,420
Of course.

377
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,672
By the officials at the air base.

378
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,261
- Why, he's a captain in the U.S. Marines.
- And we always accept the obvious?

379
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,848
You have a distrustful character.

380
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,267
I have no character. I assume one.

381
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,394
Perhaps so did he.

382
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,320
You think he was put here to spy on us?

383
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,864
It's a definite possibility.

384
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,493
By which side?

385
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,463
It's down.

386
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,217
- What?
- It's down.

387
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,886
Yes. Yes, I know.

388
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,554
And no word from Halliwell.

389
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,431
Not one word from Halliwell?

390
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,016
- No.
- What about Goodwin?

391
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,977
We don't know.

392
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,984
This Captain Ferraday...

393
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,485
how much does he know?

394
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,155
He knows enough to get us
where we want to go.

395
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,827
So you can continue to be
your same big, beguiling...

396
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,455
sweet, candid, talkative self and...

397
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,166
And tell him nothing. I know. I know.

398
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,211
What happened up there?

399
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,505
What went wrong?

400
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,717
Yes.

401
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,401
- Where'd they pick you up?
- In transit, sir.

402
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,570
That's happened to me.

403
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,658
- Sit down.
- No, thank you, sir.

404
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,832
- I see you'll be taking command.
- As soon as possible.

405
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,960
These men onboard are
the best the Corps could deliver...

406
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,338
in the short time before you sailed.

407
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,091
They're highly trained in arctic maneuvers
but untested in actual combat.

408
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:10,096
So even after you sailed, the search
went on for a properly qualified officer.

409
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,767
From your record,
they were lucky to find you.

410
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,811
In transit, you said.

411
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:21,149
Flew me straight into the chopper base
and put me onboard with that Russian.

412
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,110
Well, I understand he's on our side.

413
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,613
Wardroom.

414
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,034
- Yes, sir.
- Davis, ask Lieutenant Walker...

415
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,162
- to come into my stateroom, please.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,345
- Captain.
- Lieutenant Walker, Captain Anders.

417
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,972
He'll be taking some of the load
off your shoulders.

418
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,016
Welcome aboard.
We were all wondering...

419
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,268
Lieutenant.

420
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,147
- Sir.
- You will notify the men...

421
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,025
that there will be a
showdown inspection at 0700.

422
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,111
- Yes, sir.
- And, lieutenant...

423
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,030
it will be a bitch.

424
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,907
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

425
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,492
Yes, sir.

426
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,748
You think I was too abrupt with him.

427
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,876
I made a point of it.
See, I've saved a lot of lives...

428
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,296
- teaching men to jump when I speak.
- All right.

429
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,841
The young lieutenant's a familiar type.

430
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,551
Popular with the men.

431
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,554
As for me,
I measure an officer's weakness...

432
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,265
by every man that likes him personally.

433
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,185
I see.

434
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,895
Well, I...

435
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,315
I intended to put you in
with Lieutenant Walker.

436
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:48,236
You can see, sir, that wouldn't be in line
with my methods.

437
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,071
No.

438
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,285
All right. I'll put you in with...

439
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,204
Mr. Vaslov.

440
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,415
Thank you, sir.

441
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,540
May I?

442
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,127
- Sure. Go ahead, look around.
- Thank you.

443
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,691
Wardroom, this is Lieutenant Mingus.
Is the captain there?

444
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,232
- Captain.
- Mr. Vaslov.

445
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,987
It's fascinating. All this power.

446
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,740
- I thought you might be lost.
- Me? Never.

447
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,118
I am out exploring.

448
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,537
That is my passion.

449
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,332
Also, I am a man who loves to walk.

450
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,585
As a matter of fact...

451
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:13,715
I must walk
in order to prevent the effect of...

452
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,009
what is that word?

453
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,305
- You know, the...
- Claustrophobia.

454
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,724
Claustrophobia. Yes, yes.

455
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:27,395
A complaint I cannot share
with you or your men.

456
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,232
But a lot of us like to walk.
We can share that much.

457
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,277
Next time, you might ask
one of us along.

458
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,739
Of course. I am sorry, captain...

459
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,783
if I have committed
some transgression.

460
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,661
I do hope you do not object
to my interest in your boat.

461
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,205
No. Ask any question you like.

462
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,293
Well, naturally there is one
that I must ask.

463
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,296
Since your power source is nuclear...

464
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,757
You mean, where is it?

465
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,009
Exactly.

466
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,558
- Martin.
- Captain.

467
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,645
This is our reactor officer,
Lieutenant Mitgang. Mr. Vaslov.

468
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,564
- Lieutenant.
- How do you do, Mr. Vaslov?

469
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,741
You're standing on it.

470
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,284
Martin.

471
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,351
It...

472
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,646
It seems almost...

473
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,399
benevolent.

474
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,651
In that state, yes.

475
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,696
Confined, controlled, shielded.

476
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,989
But it is nuclear fission.

477
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,283
And it hates being confined...

478
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,327
even more than you do.

479
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,666
At least it does not have to share
its confinement.

480
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,087
- I am sorry. I was thinking about...
- Captain Anders.

481
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,674
Yes.

482
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,551
But no complaints.

483
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,721
And no reflection
on his undoubted capabilities...

484
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,264
but...

485
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,891
To me, he is not a...

486
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,394
Not a very nice man.

487
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,062
Chemistry, I suppose.

488
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,398
Never my best subject.

489
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,621
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

490
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,166
I'm Jones. Captain Anders?

491
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,667
Lieutenant Walker?

492
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,627
- Sir.
- How do you do?

493
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:01,466
Good morning. I understand you haven't
been on the ice before, lieutenant.

494
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:04,051
- No, sir.
- Where were you stationed, captain...

495
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,221
before you were picked up in transit?

496
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,431
Asia.

497
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,100
Then you haven't been on the ice either.

498
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,560
No, sir.

499
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,522
A bullet goes just as fast up here
as it does down there.

500
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,110
Not quite.
An insignificant difference, perhaps...

501
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:25,198
but I think you'll find the operational
characteristics of the M-16...

502
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:29,285
indicate that a bullet will decelerate
as much as...

503
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,831
40 feet per second per second faster
in these climatic conditions.

504
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,834
It's denser air, you know.

505
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,797
Radio, bridge. Any contact with Zebra?

506
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,383
Yes. We're receiving them faintly.

507
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,386
They're sending their call signal D-S-Y
over and over again.

508
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,846
Can you contact them?

509
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,098
No, sir. They don't answer us.

510
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,183
The signal is fading now, sir.

511
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,227
Bridge, navigator.

512
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,772
We got a good fix on them, captain.
Bearing 328.

513
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,816
Dive, Bob.

514
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,519
One hundred fathoms.

515
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,188
Ninety-five fathoms, 90 fathoms.

516
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:26,736
Kohler is calling the depths to the
bottom. This is our pet, the ice machine.

517
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,196
Bounces an echo back
from the ice above us.

518
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:33,951
This line means there's open water now.
The stylus will tell how thick the ice is.

519
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,453
First drift block, sir.

520
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,040
- Iceberg.
- Second drift block.

521
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:44,503
There is a deep-water entrance to the
barrier, but I'll try to squeeze past here.

522
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,257
The water is shallow and it's gonna be
a tight squeeze, but it will save time.

523
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,885
- Sonar.
- All clear ahead, sir.

524
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,846
Sonar tells us what's ahead
and what's behind us.

525
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,308
- Drift block.
- Sixty-five fathoms.

526
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,811
- Another drift block.
- Seventy fathoms.

527
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,648
Attention, all hands. Captain.

528
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,942
We're going under the ice now.

529
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,736
- Sixty.
- Here it comes.

530
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,529
Ten feet.

531
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,324

00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,136
Pressure ridge again.

542
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,804
Thirty feet.

543
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,657
- Sounding, 30 fathoms.
- Thick ice. Thick ice.

544
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,036
Bottom is shoaling, captain,
25 fathoms.

545
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,787
Thick ice. Regular overhead.

546
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,622
No ridges. Constant depth.

547
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,958
Still coming up, sir.
Sounding 20 fathoms.

548
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,379
Pressure ridge ahead. Depth unknown.

549
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,339
- All ahead, one-third.
- Thick ice.

550
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,885
- What's the heavy side of that ridge?
- Heavy on the port side.

551
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,929
- Right full rudder.
- Sounding, 16 fathoms.

552
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,141
- Sonar, are we clear?
- Ice close to port portside.

553
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,559
Rudder amidships.

554
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,771
- Rudder amidships.
- Eighteen feet. Thick ice.

555
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,898
Rudder is amidships.

556
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,781
Shoaling rapidly.
Sounding seven fathoms.

557
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,741
Shifting to feet on my scale.

558
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,123
- What's our depth?
- One hundred feet.

559
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,875
- Costigan?
- Thick ice.

560
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,835
- How thick?
- Twelve feet, sir.

561
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,379
Take her up to 70 feet.
I think we have room.

562
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,798
Seventy feet. Aye, sir.

563
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,769
Control, very heavy ridge ahead.

564
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,437
No depth in my scope.

565
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,567
Range inside of 300 yards.
Appears to extend clear across the bow.

566
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,737
- All stop.
- Answering all stop.

567
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,783
Sonar, disregard search and stay
on that ridge. Keep your reports coming.

568
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,992
Sonar, aye.

569
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,537
Sounding, 30 feet. Still coming up.

570
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,331
Sonar, I told you
to keep sending reports.

571
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,709
Yes, sir. Same ridge.
It is all across my forward scope area.

572
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,213
Inside of my range.
Seems heavier on the starboard bow.

573
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,971
Ridge ahead blocks me to 315.

574
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,764
Port beam possibly clear.

575
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,393

Port back one-third.

576
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,652
- Port ahead one-third.
- Port answering ahead one-third.

578
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,476
Holding steady, captain.

579
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,069
Twenty feet. Thirty.

580
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,412
Control, sonar. Clearing ahead.

581
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,497
Shifting to fathoms.

582
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,626
Ten fathoms.

583
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,669
Twenty.

584
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,172
Thirty-five.

585
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,299
Take her down to 100 feet, Ed.

586
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,469
- All ahead, standard.
- All ahead, standard.

587
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,471
Go.

588
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,235
Twelve seconds.

589
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,153
That's no better than boot camp.

590
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,447
Now let's try it with your eyes shut.

591
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,032
Sir?

592
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,326
Moore, you're in the field.

593
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:11,205
It's pitch-dark. Your weapon jams.
You have to disassemble it.

594
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,291
- What are you gonna do? Strike a match?
- Sorry, sir.

595
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,217
Mr. Jones.

596
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,636
What?

597
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,223
- Captain's compliments, sir. We're there.
- Where?

598
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,142
Zebra. Under the ice.
Their last estimated position.

599
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,437
When we get going, Mr. Jones,
we don't futz around.

600
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,981
Thank you.

601
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,984
Thick ice. Twelve feet.

602
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,695

Thin ice.

605
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,119
Switch on hull and sail floodlights.

00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,176
Control, sonar. All clear forward.

607
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,762
Ice to starboard
is inside of my range mark.

608
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,265
Very well, sonar.
Keep your reports coming.

609
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,017
Keep reporting. Sonar, aye.

610
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,936
- Let's have the camera.
- Aye, sir.

611
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,826
Trace merging.

612
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,745
Thin ice.

613
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,498
Mark. Thick ice.

614
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,125
Fifteen feet.

615
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,626
Possible pressure ridge.

616
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,632
Control, sonar.

617
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,093
Heavy close-range clutter on my scope.

618
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,720
Appears to be clear ahead.

619
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,972
Mark. Thin ice.

620
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,474
Three feet.

621
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,851
Mark. Three feet.

622
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,228
Mark, ridge, 18 feet.

623
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,813
Thinning.

624
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,523
Mark, thin.

625
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,526
Four feet. Three feet.

626
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,320
Trace merging.

627
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,780
Three feet.

628
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,198
- Speed?
- Three feet.

629
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,991
One knot, captain.

630
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,826
- All stop.
- Answering all stop.

631
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,495
Rudder is amidships.

632
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,789
- Still thin.
- All ahead one-third.

633
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,583

00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,959
Thin ice.

635
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,295
- Three feet.
- Speed, zero.

636
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,713
We're centered up now.

637
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,179
At 100 feet, sir. Stop trim.

638
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,681
Ed, bring her on up.

639
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,643
Talk to me, Costigan.

640
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,104
Thin ice. Thin ice.

641
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,272
Why are we holding our breath?

642
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,191
There's still 100 feet to go.

643
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,277
Forty, measured from the bottom
of the keel.

644
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,197
Forty feet minus the thickness of the ice,
whatever that is.

645
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,953
Coming up fast, captain.
Eighty. Seventy-five.

646
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,831
Stand by negative.
Chart for 80 to 90 feet, captain.

647
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,041
Heavy ice. Heavy ice.

648
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,894
Ninety feet. One-ten.

649
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,400
Blow negative to the mark.
All ahead two-thirds.

650
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,735
- Negative blowing.
- All ahead two-thirds.

651
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,404
One-ninety.

652
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,573
Two hundred.

653
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,826
Two-twenty. Two-forty.

654
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,674
At 260 feet, captain, and holding.

655
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,885
Current where it shouldn't have been.

656
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:57,264
Temperature inversion where it shouldn't
be. Pressure ridge out of nowhere.

657
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,602
This is the captain. Sorry about that.
Report all damage.

658
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,604
Control, maneuvering.

659
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,606
No apparent damage.

660
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,065
Very well. Stern room.

661
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,193
Stern room secure, sir.

662
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,403
One of the washing machines
is throwing a fit.

663
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,615
- Very well.
- What now?

664
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,827
What do you mean, "what now"?
We try it again.

665
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,048
- We're centered up again.
- She's holding at 100 feet.

666
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:36,303
See if you can hang there for a minute.
I think she's drifting right direction.

667
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,888
- Thin ice.
- Sonar?

668
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,141
Still have contact to starboard.
Clear ahead.

669
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,436
Thin ice. Thin ice.

670
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,980
Take her up, Ed.

671
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,982
Like she was made of glass.

672
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,192
All right. Costigan.

673
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,903
Pump from number one auxiliary to sea.

674
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,405
Pumping from number one to sea.

675
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,074
Here we go again.

676
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,452
She's coming up, sir.

677
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,871
Ninety. Eighty-five.

678
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,832
Secure pumping. Flood 1000.

679
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,210
Pumping secured. Flood 1000.

680
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,719
Contact close starboard. Very close.

681
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,515
Hold it! Hold it!

682
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,183
Contacts, dead astern.

683
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,445
- Sonar?
- Still contact to starboard, clear ahead.

684
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,114
Man, if we're holed aft...

685
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,409
- Rawlins, give her a shot of air.
- Shot of air, aye.

686
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,683
Give her another shot.

687
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,028
Tell me, captain...

688
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:19,948
if you had to compose
your own epitaph, what would it be?

689
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,533
Knock it off.

690
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,621
Why, that's good.
That's very good.

691
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,706
It's too thick.

692
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,833
We're wasting our time.

693
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,462
Take her down, Ed.

694
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,340
Jon, what's the tube status?

695
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,843
One and two are dry. We've got exercise
heads in three and four.

696
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,804
Very well. Have George
make ready number one.

697
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,432
We'll see how Torpex and ice mix.

698
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,309
Aye, aye, sir.

699
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,855
- We'll crack it with a torpedo, Mr. Jones.
- Can that be done?

700
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,107
- Don't know.
- It's never been tried before?

701
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:57,694
Nope. We'll explode it electronically
1000 yards from the ship.

702
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,489
We'll be bows on to the detonation.
We'll survive.

703
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,990
If we don't?

704
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,453
The Electric Boat Division
is going to get a very nasty letter.

705
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,664
Eyes shut.

706
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,874
Go.

707
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,008
- Are we there?
- We hope so.

708
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,512
We're gonna load a torpedo up
and punch a hole through the ice.

709
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,348
I've never seen that. Do you mind?

710
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,267
- Come on along.
- Come on, let's try it again.

711
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,478
- Excuse me.
- Try it again.

712
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,274
- It'll be number one.
- Aye, sir.

713
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,196
Control, forward room.
We're opening up number one tube.

714
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,825
Control, aye. Forward room,
the captain has the word.

715
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,703
All right. Eyes shut.

716
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,871
Go.

717
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,339
Excuse me.

718
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,394
Board checks.

719
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:17,274
- How about that marriage application?
- Yeah, how about that?

720
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,651
- Interlock check.
- Check.

721
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,987
- Did you give it to the XO for me?
- Yep.

722
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,740
Did the XO give it to the old man?
Outer doors shut.

723
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,158
Check.

724
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,076
Well?

725
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,872
Well, I don't know about him,
but I'm picking myself up from the deck.

726
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,749
George Mills, ship's tomcat.

727
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,251
Ready-made family,
built-in responsibilities.

728
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,129
- Georgie, are you ready for that?
- Lay off. Just...

729
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,965
- Hey, we got a trickle here.
- Check the drain.

730
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,801
The XO didn't give it to the old man.
Drain open.

731
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,554
Drain open. George.

732
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,892
- You know he did, in a state of shock.
- And?

733
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,269
The old man okayed it,
in the same condition.

734
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,479
- He did?
- Yeah.

735
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,732
- Hey, that's great.
- The tube, George. The tube.

736
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:04,029
I guess he figured I'd end up with one of
those seagulls he saw me with at...

737
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,614
Boy, this is tight.

738
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,493
Anyway, for the first time,
I know what I want, right? And I know...

739
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,794
Move it to the aft. Move it. Move it.

740
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,889
Close the outer door valve.

741
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,976
Control, number one tube
open to sea.

742
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,729
Shut the vents. Blow main ballast.
Emergency.

743
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,956
Full rise.

744
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,294
Collision quarters. Collision quarters.
Flooding in the forward torpedo room.

745
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,570
Close that bulkhead door!

746
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,872
- Circuits intact?
- Forward room isolated.

747
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,248
Three machines on the line.

748
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,002
Pump from auxiliaries, never
mind the red line. Transfer floodwater aft.

749
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,177
- I can't hold it, sir.
- No control on the planes.

750
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,679
We're going down and fast.

751
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,516
Forward room, control. Control.
Forward room, control.

752
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,019
- Anything?
- No, sir, the line's dead.

753
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,160
Get out!

754
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,250
- Maneuvering, give me more power.
- We're backing with all we've got.

755
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,419
We're close to shutdown on the reactor.

756
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,713
- Overload.
- Aye, sir.

757
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,214
Put it in the red.

758
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,055
Put air pressure in the auxiliaries.

759
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:38,892
- How much pressure left in the air tanks?
- Down to 800 pounds, sir.

760
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,146
- Secure aft to group blow.
- Secure aft to group.

761
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,735
She's closing, sir.

762
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,403
She's closing.

763
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,916
Check the vents for suction.

764
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,268
Secure that bulkhead door. Secure it!

765
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,062
Move it, Marine.

766
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,984
Get on the other side. Pull!

767
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,100
Forward room. Outer door closed.
Bulkhead secure. Room 910 flooded...

768
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,686
- bleeding air.
- I've got you, forward room.

769
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,116
All right, hang in there.

770
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,743
You all right?

771
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,560
Control, maneuvering. Have shutdown
temperature in turbine one.

772
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,938
- I can't hold it much longer.
- You've got to!

773
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,856
Aye, sir.

774
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:43,576
You're the most benevolent
of beings...

775
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,746
Do you mind, son? We're trying to think.

776
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:54,921
- We're losing number one turbine.
- Maintain revolutions.

777
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,131
Aye, sir.

778
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:59,300
We'll meltdown anyway
in a couple of minutes.

779
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,928
What's the difference?
The hull's gonna crack any second.

780
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,982
She's slowing.

781
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:21,698
She is slowing.

782
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:27,120
- She's slowing.
- She's slowing fast.

783
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,707
- She is slowing.
- She's slowing.

784
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,834
She's stopping.

785
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,961
It's impossible.

786
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,255
Twelve hundred and thirty feet.

787
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,341
Must be taking 40 tons
of pressure per square foot.

788
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,138
Ten feet up.

789
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,141
Secure the blow.

790
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,268
Secure the blow, aye.

791
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,562
And rising.

792
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,567
- Pumping.
- Secure pumping, aye.

793
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,485
Still rising.

794
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:08,661
She's coming up.

795
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,290
All back two-thirds.

796
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,710
Answering, all back two-thirds.

797
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,425
One hundred feet up.

798
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,594
All back one-third.

799
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,597
Answering, all back one-third.

800
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,766
And rising.

801
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,398
Thank God.

802
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,693
Yes, thank God, Vetterson.

803
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:44,489
And I'll thank the Electric Boat Division.
That covers us either way.

804
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:54,958
Attention, this is the captain. We're on
our way up. Everything is under control.

805
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,419
- Take the con, Bob.
- Aye, sir.

806
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:15,770
- Let's get these men out of here.
- Come on, men. Move it.

807
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,115
You're a good man, sir.

808
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,297
He's dead, sir.

809
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,340
Murdered.

810
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,472
- Think it could be an accident?
- Couldn't and it wasn't.

811
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:54,267
One thing that cannot happen
on a sub by accident...

812
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,687
is both ends of a torpedo tube
open to the sea at the same time.

813
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:01,858
You must connect
the hydraulic manifold...

814
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,277
to the outside door mechanism...

815
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:09,032
so that the indicator reads "shut"
when the door is actually open.

816
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,618
The same sort of electrical cross
on these two panels...

817
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:16,873
and the open position reads green
when it should flash red.

818
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:22,045
You plug up the inlet to the test cup
with gum, sealing wax, anything...

819
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:26,799
just so that it shows a dribble,
and then you open the tube...

820
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,885
and good night.

821
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,822
Vaslov.

822
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:56,162
Lieutenant Hansen is still in there.
Get these men to sickbay.

823
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:31,239
It wasn't sealing wax.
It wasn't chewing gum.

824
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,699
It was epoxy glue.

825
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,869
And suddenly,
you know a whole lot about submarines.

826
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,371
I know how to wreck them.

827
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:43,084
And I know how to lie, steal, kidnap,
counterfeit, suborn and kill.

828
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,378
That's my job. I do it with great pride.

829
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,172
And Vaslov, is that your job too?

830
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,967
- Yes, captain.
- What's your theory?

831
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,637
That there is a man aboard this ship
who committed sabotage.

832
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,222
You mean, go down with it?

833
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,765
Of course.

834
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:02,645
And as willing to die
for what he believes in as you are.

835
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,897
Or I am.

836
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:07,900
And what do you believe in, Mr. Vaslov?

837
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:13,030
That should be obvious, captain.

838
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:15,908
I was born a Russian...

839
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:19,579
but I chose my side
out of conviction...

840
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,747
not by accident of birth.

841
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:25,168
And since I got him
through the Berlin Wall in 1961...

842
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:31,507
his convictions have been proven by
British Intelligence, your CIA and by me.

843
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:34,427
Somebody doesn't want us
to get to Ice Station Zebra.

844
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,013
- Why?
- The job could have been done...

845
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,724
before you sailed.
A civilian dock guard...

846
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,934
Those men have top security clearances.

847
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:45,521
People with top security clearances
are being hung every day.

848
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:48,691
But if you must have a suspect
aboard the ship...

849
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:52,278
I give you Captain Anders.

850
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,323
- Is that an accusation?
- A nomination.

851
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,533
Why?

852
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,785
He's the only one that none of us know.

853
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:03,831
He's too perfect. Picked up in transit,
dropped out of the skies...

854
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,666
I don't believe it.

855
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:10,630
Boris, did anyone at the helicopter base
know or recognize Captain Anders?

856
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,799
- No, but he had orders.
- He had Captain Anders' orders...

857
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:18,095
but is he Captain Anders, or is
Captain Anders lying dead somewhere?

858
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:22,141
- I've done the same to the other side.
- You go along with this?

859
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:26,979
Please. I do not like Captain Anders,
so I disqualify myself.

860
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:32,109
Captain, when you surface, you can
radio to check on his authenticity.

861
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:35,488
Very well. I'll check on Captain Anders...

862
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:39,784
- And Mr. Vaslov and you.
- I've already vouched for Mr. Vaslov.

863
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,953
- As for me, you can eliminate me.
- Why?

864
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,288
You must, by a logical absurdity.

865
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:47,208
Have you forgotten?
I'm in charge of this operation.

866
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,460
Never entered my mind.

867
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,964
Then you'd better look again
at your orders.

868
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:58,010
I haven't labored the point so far because
you've done all that's been required.

869
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:04,725
But the primary objective of this mission
is to get me to Ice Station Zebra.

870
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:09,605
Those orders come from chief of naval
operations, to him from the president.

871
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:14,235
So before we go any further,
I suggest that you get me there.

872
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:18,698
Put another torpedo up the spout,
blow a hole in the ice and get me there!

873
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,951
One of my men is dead.

874
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,996
Three badly hurt,
and my ship nearly wiped out.

875
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,582
Now, you take another look
at those orders.

876
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,750
I'm in command of this submarine...

877
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:33,004
and I'm not sticking another torpedo
up that spout...

878
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:38,509
or taking another chance or making
another move until I know exactly...

879
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,178
what we're doing and why.

880
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:45,349
Captain, control.
We've hit a lead. We're under thin ice.

881
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:50,354
Well, that does make the problem
academic, doesn't it, captain?

882
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:58,821
Thin ice.

883
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,281
Thin ice.

884
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,659
Three feet.

885
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:08,789
Two feet.

886
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,499
Three feet.

887
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,794
Thin ice. Three feet.

888
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,921
Two feet.

889
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,632
Three feet.

890
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,300
Thin ice.

891
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,135
- Thin ice.
- Take her up.

892
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,970
Three feet.

893
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,308
Three feet.

894
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,726
Two feet.

895
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:47,972
Bridge, radio.
We have contact with Zebra.

896
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,391
Captain has the word.

897
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:01,777
We have their bearings.

898
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,614
- Did they see our rocket?
- No acknowledgment, sir.

899
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,286
Are you in two-way contact?

900
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,789
No, sir. We can't get them
to acknowledge our signal.

901
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,461
Can you read him?

902
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:22,757
Fragments, sir, but he makes no sense.
Everything's completely garbled.

903
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:31,307
He's dying, sir.
I mean, his signal's dying.

904
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:37,480
Gone now.

905
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,984
Nothing.

906
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:47,615
- Did you get a fix, Tom?
- Yes, sir. Two-way fix...

907
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,826
with the bearing we got
before we went under the ice.

908
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:54,914
- That's just under three miles.
- Vaslov, three miles. In this storm?

909
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:59,293
- We can make it.
- How many men should we take?

910
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:04,298
Compass is useless up here. We'll need
DF radio for direction. We need a doctor.

911
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:09,053
That's Vaslov, you, me, Zabrinczski
with backpack, walkie-talkie and DF.

912
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:13,015
Dr. Benning. Wassmeyer, with all
the medical equipment he can carry.

913
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,268
Mr. Hansen, gather all that arctic gear
we put onboard...

914
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:20,564
rations, lights, heaters, all of it,
and pick one more man.

915
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:23,359
- Aye, sir.
- And the Marines.

916
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,153
Yes. Captain, get your men ready.

917
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,863
Yes, sir.

918
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,535
If he's what he's supposed to be,
he goes.

919
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:36,622
- If not, I'd be a fool to keep him onboard.
- Splendid.

920
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:40,751
As you reminded me, Mr. Jones,
my orders are get you to Zebra.

921
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,170
We move out in 10 minutes.

922
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,600
Ten degrees left.

923
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:26,935
Go 10 degrees left, Zabrinczski.

924
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:29,354
Ten degrees left.
Acknowledge.

925
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:32,566
He rogered, sir.

926
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,652
Bridge, radio.
We're in contact with Zebra party.

927
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,738
It acknowledged course correction.

928
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,074
Bridge, aye, radio.

929
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,449
Help!

930
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,530
I'm caught.

931
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:51,473
Radio, bridge. Any contact with Zebra?

932
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,850
No contact, sir. No contact.

933
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:04,361
Zebra, this is Viking calling.
Do you read me? Answer.

934
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,738
Come in, Zeb. Answer on voice.

935
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,208
Can you get them? Can you get Zebra?

936
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,418
No contact, sir.

937
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:22,546
- Prepare to dive.
- Prepare to dive, aye.

938
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:25,757
Zebra, this is Viking calling.
Come in, Zeb. Acknowledge.

939
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:28,093
Acknowledge. Do you read me, Zeb?

940
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:45,402
- All the vents under diving alarm.
- Aye, sir.

941
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,446
Hatch shut.

942
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:49,031
- Straight below.
- Take her down.

943
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:52,659
- Open forward group.
- Open forward group, aye.

944
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,537
Dive.

945
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:23,357
- Break out the bow planes.
- Break out the bow planes, aye.

946
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:25,776
All ahead one-third.

947
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,028
Answering all ahead one-third.

948
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,113
Give me three degrees down, Kentner.

949
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,573
Three degrees down.

950
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:58,308
Can you smell it?

951
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,852
Burnt rubber.

952
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:15,797
Post your men, captain.

953
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:38,403
Move.

954
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,365
Kilyar!

955
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:45,160
Kilyar! Kilyar!

956
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:47,329
Here, my friend. Whiskey.

957
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,039
Here.

958
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:57,756
Viking, this is Zebra. Come in.

959
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,468
Viking, come in. This is Zebra.

960
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,765
Viking, can you read me?

961
01:34:07,099 --> 01:34:09,559
Viking, this is Zebra. Come in.

962
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,938
You took so long getting here.

963
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:17,233
- What happened?
- Explosion.

964
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:20,195
Yes. Halliwell.

965
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:21,946
Halliwell.

966
01:34:22,114 --> 01:34:25,241
- You took your time getting here.
- Where is he?

967
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:26,660
Halliwell.

968
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,162
Viking. Come in, Viking. This is Zebra.

969
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,456
- It's our hut.
- Yes.

970
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:32,957
Your hut.

971
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:36,044
There's 17 of you. Where are they?

972
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:38,463
Where are the others?

973
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:42,258
Dr. Goodwin.

974
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:44,636
Do you know Dr. Goodwin?

975
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:48,306
He saved our lives.

976
01:34:49,308 --> 01:34:51,726
Viking, come in. This is Zebra. Over.

977
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:58,108
Viking, come in. This is Zebra. Over.

978
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:02,987
Halliwell.

979
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,949
Christopher Halliwell.

980
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:08,118
- Burning.
- Where is he?

981
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,620
- Burning.
- Where?

982
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,499
- Flames.
- Dr. Goodwin.

983
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:15,709
Where is he?

984
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,877
Viking. Come in. This is Zebra.

985
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,754
- Where?
- Flames.

986
01:35:19,922 --> 01:35:22,090
Dr. Goodwin. Dr...

987
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:24,551
This is Zebra, Viking. Do you read me?

988
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,637
- ...Goodwin.
- Covered in flames.

989
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,390
McBane.

990
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,308
McBane, old friend.

991
01:35:32,476 --> 01:35:34,185
- Boris.
- Yes.

992
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:36,938
Yes, I'm here.

993
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,024
Tell me, how did the fire start?

994
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:41,693
Asleep.

995
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,486
You were asleep.

996
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,198
Where is Halliwell?
Tell me, where is Halliwell?

997
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:49,534
Where is Halliwell?

998
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:51,870
- Halliwell...
- Yes.

999
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:56,207
- He was burned.
- Burned. But where is he?

1000
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,293
We're the only ones left.

1001
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,754
Yes, but where is Halliwell?

1002
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,924
Dr. Goodwin tried to help him.

1003
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:06,551
Dr. Goodwin?

1004
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,928
Where is Goodwin?

1005
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:11,723
The fire.

1006
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,100
Where were you when it started?

1007
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:16,060
The fire.

1008
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:18,104
Where were you?

1009
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:22,734
- Keep trying, Zabrinczski.
- Aye, sir.

1010
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,486
David...

1011
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,070
Didn't work.

1012
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:29,365
Viking. Come in, Viking. This is Zebra.

1013
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,494
Viking, this is Zebra.

1014
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:34,204
Come in.

1015
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:37,916
Viking, this is Zebra. Come in, Viking.

1016
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:33,132
Dr. Goodwin.

1017
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,060
Halliwell, Denison, Hughes,
they are all there.

1018
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:47,271
Did you search them?

1019
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:49,232
They do not have it.

1020
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,787
Shot before they were burned.

1021
01:40:03,455 --> 01:40:05,456
Exactly.

1022
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:07,792
And Goodwin shot them.

1023
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,585
Obvious.

1024
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:16,968
I would say that the...

1025
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:19,137
good doctor...

1026
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:26,519
was after something before he died.

1027
01:40:28,313 --> 01:40:32,400
Zabrinczski, there's an ice drill in
that building over there, the orange one.

1028
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:36,112
- See that flat spot 1000 feet out?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,864
- Punch a hole in it.
- Yes, sir.

1030
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:02,722
Meteorological balloon.

1031
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,599
Helium...

1032
01:41:06,351 --> 01:41:08,853
to inflate it and...

1033
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:12,356
line, to run it up for collection.

1034
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:18,029
Was Goodwin your man?

1035
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:20,865
It's not here.

1036
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,284
No, he was theirs.

1037
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:27,038
Our man was...

1038
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:28,873
Halliwell.

1039
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:31,375
That's him.

1040
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:34,670
See if you can find it, Boris.

1041
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,436
Now let's see if we can catch ourselves
a submarine.

1042
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:10,391
Control, sonar.

1043
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:11,893
I have the transponder.

1044
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:15,396
Bearing 345, relative.

1045
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:16,981
We have the word, sonar.

1046
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,358
- Put that line in.
- Aye, sir.

1047
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,527
- Come right 10 degrees.
- Right 10, aye.

1048
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:46,761
What size is the film?

1049
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:51,182
Four-and-a-half-inch reel...

1050
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,059
16 millimeter...

1051
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:55,311
in an insulated aluminum capsule.

1052
01:43:55,479 --> 01:44:00,024
And all of a sudden, you know
a whole damn lot about my business.

1053
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:09,784
We don't believe in going on a mission
totally blindfolded, Mr. Jones.

1054
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:16,374
The film came out of a camera...

1055
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:19,460
- mounted in a Russian satellite.
- Did it belong to Russia?

1056
01:44:19,628 --> 01:44:22,004
That's a delicate point.
It was our camera.

1057
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:24,548
We developed it.
It's not bad engineering.

1058
01:44:24,716 --> 01:44:27,093
Took three years to develop,
round-the-clock work.

1059
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:32,640
Can't be duplicated for two years.
Certain processes in grinding lenses.

1060
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:34,809
It's an incredible piece of machinery.

1061
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:36,560
It's got a focal length of...

1062
01:44:36,728 --> 01:44:40,606
It can photograph a packet of cigarettes
from 300 miles up in space...

1063
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:44,860
on a tiny negative
capable of infinite enlargement.

1064
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:48,698
You see, your American lads,
you came up with a new film emulsion...

1065
01:44:48,865 --> 01:44:52,535
very hush-hush,
but 100 times more sensitive...

1066
01:44:52,703 --> 01:44:55,037
than anything previously available.

1067
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:59,458
And the negative is miraculously
developed within the satellite itself.

1068
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:03,254
You put our film in your camera
and you had a hell of a box Brownie.

1069
01:45:03,755 --> 01:45:07,383
No, the Russians had.
We lent it to you fellows, and you lost it.

1070
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,969
- Lost it?
- Hijacked in broad daylight.

1071
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:14,807
Dismantled, smuggled into Havana...

1072
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,435
and then the...

1073
01:45:17,602 --> 01:45:22,106
the Russians put our camera,
made by our German scientists...

1074
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:25,526
and your film,
made by your German scientists...

1075
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:28,696
into their satellite,
made by their German scientists.

1076
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:32,867
Thus, up it went, round and round,
whizzing over the U.S. Seven times a day.

1077
01:45:33,035 --> 01:45:36,829
- Photographing missile bases.
- Within 48 hours, they had pictures...

1078
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:39,457
of every missile base in North America.

1079
01:45:39,624 --> 01:45:43,878
Every time our camera took a picture,
another one took a fix on the stars.

1080
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:48,674
They could just check their coordinates
to aim missiles at all our launching pads.

1081
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,801
If they had the film.

1082
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:53,929
The irony is that it's still here...

1083
01:45:54,097 --> 01:45:55,765
at Zebra.

1084
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:57,183
Somewhere.

1085
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:02,688
- And this is not the way to find it.
- How did it get here?

1086
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:07,193
- The Russians ran into a little trouble.
- That's encouraging.

1087
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,362
Initially academic, or so it seemed.

1088
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:13,824
The satellite was orbiting over North
America, western Russia and Siberia...

1089
01:46:13,992 --> 01:46:16,994
but that darling little camera
went right on...

1090
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:19,622
taking pictures
when it wasn't supposed to.

1091
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:22,208
- Beautiful pictures.
- Of Russian installations.

1092
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:25,127
Which makes that piece of film
the most dangerous...

1093
01:46:25,295 --> 01:46:27,088
and desirable...

1094
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:29,590
bit of information in the world.

1095
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:34,720
And then they ran into real trouble.
See, here they are, orbiting like this...

1096
01:46:34,888 --> 01:46:37,932
when they fired the retros
for a comedown in Siberia...

1097
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:41,685
one of the rockets misfired.
Instead of slowing the satellite...

1098
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:45,648
they just swung it into a new orbit
from pole to pole.

1099
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:48,943
That's embarrassing for the Russians.
Nine-tenths of it...

1100
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:51,320
was over water and our free world.

1101
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:54,865
None was over the Soviet Union
or any sphere of Communist influence.

1102
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:57,410
That's when the lights began to burn
in the Kremlin.

1103
01:46:57,577 --> 01:47:01,455
Although the orbit had been radically
changed, the satellite was not aborted.

1104
01:47:01,623 --> 01:47:06,585
They still had sufficient control to bring
it down in a reentry. But where?

1105
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:11,382
A pickup in the ocean would involve
a whole naval operation. We'd know.

1106
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:14,343
And a land expedition
would be even worse.

1107
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:16,053
They should have asked us.

1108
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:18,556
They were hoping
we didn't know it existed.

1109
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:24,770
We calculated they had 13 days in which
to determine the point of reentry.

1110
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:28,732
Beyond that, the satellite would
slow down, reenter of its own accord...

1111
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,860
and burn up in the atmosphere.

1112
01:47:31,027 --> 01:47:33,821
- Consider their dilemma.
- The Arctic or the Antarctic.

1113
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:37,408
The Antarctic is busy.
There are scientific expeditions there...

1114
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:40,578
from the U.S., Great Britain,
Netherlands, Chile...

1115
01:47:40,745 --> 01:47:43,122
- France, Australia, New Zealand...
- Russia.

1116
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,959
And Russia. We sent Vaslov down there
to sniff about, just in case...

1117
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,712
- And we turned our attention to...
- Zebra.

1118
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,130
At the North Pole.

1119
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:53,424
The innocent civilian weather station.

1120
01:47:53,592 --> 01:47:55,092
Isolated from the world...

1121
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:58,387
studying the weather
and the movement of the ice pack.

1122
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:01,599
Perfect cover for the Russians.

1123
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,018
Ten days ago...

1124
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:09,315
a Dr. R.A. Goodwin appeared
and applied for permission...

1125
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:13,861
to do some research here. A university
professor of impeccable qualifications...

1126
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:17,615
he was immediately accepted
and flown up the next day.

1127
01:48:17,782 --> 01:48:20,951
- You knew he was their agent?
- Ever since he became impeccable.

1128
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:24,246
Now, we knew exactly
where they would drop the satellite.

1129
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:28,292
Then three of your men of impeccable
qualifications came up the next day.

1130
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,002
No. Same day, same flight.

1131
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:33,172
- Goodwin didn't suspect?
- What difference does it make?

1132
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:36,133
If he sent for reinforcements,
we'd send them too.

1133
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:39,637
He'd escalate, we'd escalate,
and soon somebody pushes a button.

1134
01:48:39,804 --> 01:48:43,307
We have a very strict code of ethics
in our game, captain.

1135
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:45,976
We usually know what cards
the other man holds...

1136
01:48:46,144 --> 01:48:49,146
but we always keep our aces
up both sleeves.

1137
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:52,399
The Russians positioned their satellite
for reentry.

1138
01:48:52,567 --> 01:48:55,569
At 4:23 in the morning, three days ago.

1139
01:48:56,821 --> 01:49:00,199
And an Arctic storm appeared
and obliterated the whole scene.

1140
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,451
There you have it. Silence.

1141
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:06,789
No communication for six hours,
then garbled calls for help.

1142
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,832
Fire, disaster, death.

1143
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,085
Calls to both sides.

1144
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,003
Here we are.

1145
01:49:13,713 --> 01:49:16,340
Then when the storm clears
and the wind dies...

1146
01:49:16,508 --> 01:49:19,218
that's when the first Russian planes
will arrive.

1147
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,971
Planes are standing by on both sides.

1148
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:25,266
The storm is clearing from the west.

1149
01:49:25,433 --> 01:49:27,518
- Siberia.
- Exactly.

1150
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:31,814
Then Halliwell got to the film first
and Goodwin shot him.

1151
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:36,485
If he was first. If Goodwin was first,
then Halliwell was killed trying to get it.

1152
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:39,905
In any event, there was
a shooting match out in the snow...

1153
01:49:40,073 --> 01:49:42,408
and Goodwin came out of it alive.

1154
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:45,369
- Wounded, but alive.
- But he got caught in the fire too.

1155
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:48,289
I believe he started the fire
to obliterate the evidence.

1156
01:49:48,456 --> 01:49:52,418
Burn down the whole camp.
Live on the supplies he'd stacked away.

1157
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:54,378
Yes, he got caught.

1158
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:58,215
When the storm cleared,
he'd run the film up on that balloon...

1159
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:00,676
and a Russian plane would pick it up.

1160
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:06,056
And we'd live under the threat of what
was on that film for the rest of our lives.

1161
01:50:56,441 --> 01:51:00,402
Whoever went out there in that storm
must have had some electronic device.

1162
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:04,031
A homer, to lead him to the capsule.
He couldn't have seen it.

1163
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,699
Very good, captain.

1164
01:51:05,867 --> 01:51:07,451
And dead right.

1165
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:10,120
Both men had such a device.

1166
01:51:10,288 --> 01:51:12,956
Well, then, if we find the homer...

1167
01:51:13,124 --> 01:51:14,958
we've found the capsule.

1168
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:17,294
Very good, captain, and dead wrong.

1169
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:20,589
I brought one with me.
Same as Halliwell's.

1170
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:23,509
Unfortunately, it doesn't work.

1171
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,136
The frequency's been changed.

1172
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:29,640
Or the film isn't here.

1173
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:33,143
It's here, all right.

1174
01:51:34,562 --> 01:51:38,440
Pity you mislaid your submarine.
We could have used your men.

1175
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,479
I want 100 men out here.

1176
01:52:17,647 --> 01:52:19,815
Stretchers, stretcher-bearers,
lights and cables.

1177
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:22,317
- Aye, sir.
- Bridge, radar.

1178
01:52:22,485 --> 01:52:26,029
- Unidentified aircraft on our scope.
- Bridge, aye.

1179
01:52:26,197 --> 01:52:29,032
Captain, radar has reported
unidentified aircraft.

1180
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,826
What direction? What speed?

1181
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:36,540
Radar, give me a fix on that aircraft.

1182
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:40,169
From the west, bearing 278.

1183
01:52:40,837 --> 01:52:43,547
Speed, 620 knots.

1184
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:46,258
Estimated time of arrival, 17 minutes.

1185
01:54:10,718 --> 01:54:12,970
- Well?
- Nothing.

1186
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:16,974
Nothing.

1187
01:54:34,534 --> 01:54:37,744
Radar reports aircraft now at 117 miles.

1188
01:54:37,912 --> 01:54:40,330
Approaching at 620 knots.

1189
01:54:40,498 --> 01:54:43,333
Estimated time of arrival, nine minutes.

1190
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,837
What about my air support request?

1191
01:54:47,005 --> 01:54:50,090
Negative. Our planes can't move.
They're completely weathered in.

1192
01:55:00,184 --> 01:55:02,185
How's it coming, Martin?

1193
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,898
Can you find the frequency
to locate the capsule or can't you?

1194
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:11,528
Well, sir, in zones of visible aurora, you
get transmissions in the sporadic E layer.

1195
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:14,698
- Like a cloud stratum.
- Just tell me when it works.

1196
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:15,949
Yes, sir.

1197
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:19,328
Zebra party, radar
reports second flight of aircraft.

1198
01:55:19,495 --> 01:55:21,914
Target Bravo.
Same speed, same bearing.

1199
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:24,625
Estimated one minute behind first flight.

1200
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,489
Aircraft now at 21 miles.

1201
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:40,617
Estimated time of arrival, two minutes.

1202
01:56:52,922 --> 01:56:58,385
Aircraft now at 11 miles.
Estimated time of arrival, one minute.

1203
01:59:02,218 --> 01:59:05,512
Zebra party,
radar has picked up subsonic aircraft.

1204
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,681
Target Charlie. Same bearing.

1205
01:59:07,849 --> 01:59:11,560
Speed, 365 knots.
ETA, four minutes.

1206
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:13,353
That'll be the paratroopers.

1207
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:37,043
Don't move, captain.

1208
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:41,715
Put the gun down.

1209
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:45,552
Carefully.

1210
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:53,810
Put the gun down, captain.

1211
01:59:55,104 --> 01:59:58,064
Do not reach for the trigger...

1212
01:59:58,232 --> 01:59:59,566
or you'll never touch it.

1213
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:03,361
And don't shout.
You will never hear it.

1214
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:10,994
Now step forward, carefully.

1215
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:14,748
Put your hands
on the railing in front of you.

1216
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:19,502
Both hands.

1217
02:00:21,464 --> 02:00:26,426
Now, keeping both hands on the railing,
come down the stairs.

1218
02:00:26,844 --> 02:00:30,013
One step at a time.

1219
02:00:46,364 --> 02:00:49,282
And I was just beginning to think
it was him.

1220
02:00:50,368 --> 02:00:52,535
He always thought it was you.

1221
02:00:54,747 --> 02:01:00,085
You see, had I been born in England,
and he in Russia...

1222
02:01:00,544 --> 02:01:03,672
he would be standing here
and I would be lying there.

1223
02:01:04,131 --> 02:01:06,716
Yet one takes no pleasure...

1224
02:01:06,884 --> 02:01:10,011
in mutilating one's...

1225
02:01:10,471 --> 02:01:12,222
identical twin.

1226
02:01:12,723 --> 02:01:14,724
But you expect me to do it for you?

1227
02:01:18,104 --> 02:01:19,896
No.

1228
02:01:20,564 --> 02:01:24,234
I expect you to pick up that crowbar...

1229
02:01:24,735 --> 02:01:27,070
and kill me.

1230
02:01:31,158 --> 02:01:34,244
Yes. You are in excellent shape.

1231
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:39,165
Three or four good blows should do it.
A broken rib, an arm...

1232
02:01:39,917 --> 02:01:43,586
You want them to think that I?

1233
02:01:45,172 --> 02:01:46,464
Go to hell.

1234
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:51,803
I undoubtedly will, captain,
but not before you.

1235
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:54,889
Now, pick up the crowbar.

1236
02:01:57,601 --> 02:01:59,019
If I don't...

1237
02:01:59,186 --> 02:02:01,896
the worst that can happen
is that you kill me...

1238
02:02:02,064 --> 02:02:04,024
and you're gonna do that anyway.

1239
02:02:04,358 --> 02:02:07,277
So you go ahead and pull that trigger.

1240
02:02:07,445 --> 02:02:10,030
You're not going to use me
as an excuse.

1241
02:02:12,783 --> 02:02:17,454
They say a bull in the ring...

1242
02:02:17,621 --> 02:02:20,123
dies a much better death...

1243
02:02:20,499 --> 02:02:23,376
than a steer in a slaughterhouse.

1244
02:02:24,253 --> 02:02:26,463
A bull has a chance.

1245
02:02:28,257 --> 02:02:31,217
Do you want to be killed
for a bull, captain...

1246
02:02:31,719 --> 02:02:33,303
or a steer?

1247
02:02:33,929 --> 02:02:36,181
Now, pick up the crowbar.

1248
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:39,225
At least it is a weapon...

1249
02:02:39,977 --> 02:02:42,479
and who knows?
If you strike very quickly...

1250
02:02:42,646 --> 02:02:46,024
you might even take me by surprise.

1251
02:02:47,485 --> 02:02:49,069
Pick it up.

1252
02:02:50,071 --> 02:02:51,654
Pick it up!

1253
02:02:58,204 --> 02:03:00,497
Now hit me.

1254
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:04,417
Hit me!

1255
02:04:02,935 --> 02:04:04,727
Dr. Benning!

1256
02:04:05,062 --> 02:04:08,064
Jones. Jones shot him.

1257
02:04:08,232 --> 02:04:09,566
I found him here.

1258
02:04:09,733 --> 02:04:12,318
As I was bending over,
the captain, Anders...

1259
02:04:12,486 --> 02:04:16,823
attacked me with the crowbar,
and Jones... Jones shot him.

1260
02:04:18,909 --> 02:04:20,702
He's dead, sir.

1261
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,662
Captain.

1262
02:04:34,049 --> 02:04:36,259
Captain. Captain?

1263
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:45,602
The pistol. He found Goodwin's pistol.

1264
02:04:56,697 --> 02:04:59,073
This couldn't be that important.

1265
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:19,177
Captain, look.

1266
02:05:27,478 --> 02:05:29,229
You found it.

1267
02:05:29,396 --> 02:05:31,689
You found it!

1268
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:43,201
Find the capsule, Vaslov.

1269
02:05:51,252 --> 02:05:54,546
Walker, you and your men go with him.

1270
02:05:54,713 --> 02:05:56,214
Yes, sir.

1271
02:06:44,054 --> 02:06:46,264
You see that light?

1272
02:06:46,432 --> 02:06:48,266
It is booby-trapped.

1273
02:06:57,026 --> 02:07:00,528
Webson, Costigan, Parker, Nichols,
stay here. Kohler.

1274
02:07:00,696 --> 02:07:03,781
All ship's company, back to the ship,
on the double!

1275
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:06,534
All right, move it. Move it.

1276
02:07:12,374 --> 02:07:14,876
- You know what to do, Bob.
- Aye, sir.

1277
02:07:15,044 --> 02:07:16,961
I'm putting the crew back onboard.

1278
02:07:17,129 --> 02:07:19,339
You handle the ship
if you have to go under.

1279
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:22,508
Now, if anything blows,
submerge and get out.

1280
02:07:22,676 --> 02:07:24,886
Without waiting to get
the rest of you aboard?

1281
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:28,014
Without waiting for anything.
Chip it out.

1282
02:07:28,182 --> 02:07:31,809
- There's two acetylene torches inside.
- Get them and get Lt. Mitgang.

1283
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:33,269
Yes, sir.

1284
02:09:39,813 --> 02:09:42,398
Captain, we see paratroopers
moving towards you.

1285
02:09:42,566 --> 02:09:45,860
We can't estimate the number,
but it's a large force.

1286
02:09:51,325 --> 02:09:56,287
Now, Martin, Zabrinczski,
I want your technical opinion...

1287
02:09:56,455 --> 02:09:59,081
the best you can come up with.

1288
02:10:00,334 --> 02:10:03,586
Obviously, the device
attached to the capsule is explosive.

1289
02:10:03,754 --> 02:10:08,049
What I must know is,
will it explode if we pick it up?

1290
02:10:08,383 --> 02:10:10,176
Sir.

1291
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:19,811
Get it out of there.

1292
02:10:39,957 --> 02:10:41,666
Commander Ferraday?

1293
02:10:42,042 --> 02:10:43,626
I'm Commander Ferraday.

1294
02:10:48,799 --> 02:10:50,633
I'm Colonel Ostrovsky, sir.

1295
02:10:51,218 --> 02:10:55,805
I congratulate you and your crew
on the success of your rescue mission.

1296
02:10:55,973 --> 02:10:58,808
The world will rejoice to hear of it.

1297
02:11:00,435 --> 02:11:03,020
I'm here with my men
on another mission...

1298
02:11:03,188 --> 02:11:07,984
not so praiseworthy, perhaps,
but equally peaceful.

1299
02:11:08,694 --> 02:11:11,654
We have come to recover
a certain capsule...

1300
02:11:11,822 --> 02:11:14,991
which was taken
from an element of a certain satellite...

1301
02:11:15,534 --> 02:11:18,160
which was placed into orbit...

1302
02:11:18,328 --> 02:11:21,831
by the Union of the Soviet
Socialistic Republics.

1303
02:11:22,332 --> 02:11:27,837
As you know, this capsule
is the property of my government...

1304
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:32,008
and we only wish to obtain
that which belongs to us...

1305
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:35,094
under international law.

1306
02:11:35,345 --> 02:11:37,221
Therefore, sir...

1307
02:11:37,848 --> 02:11:40,224
I know you and your men
will withdraw...

1308
02:11:40,392 --> 02:11:44,645
and permit us to take possession
of what is rightfully ours.

1309
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:53,988
We will do so directly, sir,
but first, under international law...

1310
02:11:54,156 --> 02:11:58,784
we will remove the film which was
taken from the United States...

1311
02:11:58,952 --> 02:12:03,205
which was in a camera belonging
to the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

1312
02:12:03,665 --> 02:12:07,418
When that is done,
then, sir, you may have your capsule.

1313
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,837
Commander Ferraday...

1314
02:12:10,297 --> 02:12:15,384
this is not the time or place
to play with words.

1315
02:12:16,762 --> 02:12:19,847
You have undoubtedly discovered
by now...

1316
02:12:20,015 --> 02:12:23,225
that the capsule will explode
if opened.

1317
02:12:23,602 --> 02:12:27,438
I believe your expression is "booby trap."

1318
02:12:30,484 --> 02:12:32,318
Can you open it, Mr. Vaslov?

1319
02:12:32,778 --> 02:12:34,946
- I have been briefed. I can try.
- Do it.

1320
02:12:35,948 --> 02:12:40,326
The instrument you see
is an electronic detonator.

1321
02:12:41,244 --> 02:12:43,704
It is tuned to an exploding device...

1322
02:12:43,872 --> 02:12:47,375
which is incorporated
within the capsule.

1323
02:12:49,336 --> 02:12:51,212
The safety is off.

1324
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:54,090
The detonator is armed.

1325
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:59,261
It can now be detonated
from where I stand...

1326
02:12:59,805 --> 02:13:03,474
by a very slight pressure of my thumb.

1327
02:13:03,684 --> 02:13:06,143
I trust your intelligence, sir...

1328
02:13:06,395 --> 02:13:08,396
not to move the capsule.

1329
02:13:08,897 --> 02:13:11,983
But if you should attempt to do so...

1330
02:13:12,442 --> 02:13:16,862
even if you should manage to place it
within your submarine...

1331
02:13:17,197 --> 02:13:19,573
Well, I leave it to you, sir...

1332
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:25,579
to decide whether or not
your hull could survive the explosion.

1333
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,334
Sir...

1334
02:13:30,502 --> 02:13:34,338
you and your men
will stand away and release the capsule.

1335
02:13:34,506 --> 02:13:39,510
Sir, those of us who are unarmed
will withdraw.

1336
02:13:43,682 --> 02:13:47,184
The rest of us, sir, will not.

1337
02:13:49,187 --> 02:13:52,398
Now I must tell you how wrong you are.

1338
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:56,527
You are faced and flanked
by over 100 of my men...

1339
02:13:57,070 --> 02:14:01,073
most of them
in excellent positions of concealment...

1340
02:14:01,241 --> 02:14:04,410
and have automatic weapons
trained upon you...

1341
02:14:04,703 --> 02:14:08,539
and your vastly inferior force.

1342
02:14:13,462 --> 02:14:15,713
I must also tell you, sir...

1343
02:14:15,881 --> 02:14:21,302
although I'm under strict orders
to avoid violence if possible...

1344
02:14:22,387 --> 02:14:26,724
my personal nature is a violent one.

1345
02:14:28,769 --> 02:14:33,314
I'm experiencing grave difficulties
as it is...

1346
02:14:33,482 --> 02:14:37,401
in restraining myself
from pressing this button...

1347
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,322
giving my men the command
to open fire.

1348
02:14:42,115 --> 02:14:43,824
Commander...

1349
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:47,328
I will give you
exactly two minutes...

1350
02:14:47,704 --> 02:14:50,539
to stand away
and release the capsule...

1351
02:14:50,874 --> 02:14:52,500
beginning...

1352
02:14:53,168 --> 02:14:54,710
now.

1353
02:15:00,342 --> 02:15:02,218
In the container...

1354
02:15:03,303 --> 02:15:04,553
comrade.

1355
02:15:21,029 --> 02:15:23,864
Reassemble the capsule,
Mr. Vaslov.

1356
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:10,244
Put the container down, Mr. Vaslov,
and stand up.

1357
02:16:16,251 --> 02:16:18,377
Colonel Ostrovsky...

1358
02:16:19,087 --> 02:16:20,796
I have two civilians here.

1359
02:16:21,423 --> 02:16:24,967
I request permission
for them to leave the field.

1360
02:16:37,606 --> 02:16:39,523
Permission granted.

1361
02:16:42,777 --> 02:16:44,945
Away from the submarine.

1362
02:17:09,054 --> 02:17:10,221
Enough!

1363
02:17:20,482 --> 02:17:23,692
Commander, time is up.

1364
02:17:25,111 --> 02:17:27,529
Either you give me the capsule...

1365
02:17:27,697 --> 02:17:31,033
or I order my men to advance
to take the capsule...

1366
02:17:31,409 --> 02:17:33,535
and to open fire...

1367
02:17:33,703 --> 02:17:38,040
if one man in your command
should fire one shot.

1368
02:17:56,559 --> 02:17:58,143
Colonel Ostrovsky.

1369
02:18:17,998 --> 02:18:21,959
The responsibility
for what will happen now...

1370
02:18:22,127 --> 02:18:25,921
is yours and yours alone.

1371
02:18:26,089 --> 02:18:28,674
Take the capsule.

1372
02:19:03,835 --> 02:19:08,005
My compliments, commander,
on your decision.

1373
02:20:21,371 --> 02:20:22,746
Hold your fire!

1374
02:20:37,971 --> 02:20:39,888
Hold your fire!

1375
02:21:25,268 --> 02:21:27,769
Give him the film, Mr. Jones.

1376
02:21:34,611 --> 02:21:36,612
Give him the film.

1377
02:21:56,299 --> 02:22:00,344
Young man, put your gun down.

1378
02:22:00,970 --> 02:22:03,222
If you use it now,
you will be shot down...

1379
02:22:03,389 --> 02:22:05,641
and there is no need for that.

1380
02:22:05,808 --> 02:22:09,019
We have what we came for.
The incident is closed.

1381
02:22:09,187 --> 02:22:13,857
It will be closed, sir,
when we have the film.

1382
02:22:14,609 --> 02:22:16,318
Stand back.

1383
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:20,155
You will be dead before I am.

1384
02:22:20,323 --> 02:22:24,660
Either way,
you know I'll pull the trigger...

1385
02:22:25,203 --> 02:22:26,495
and hold it.

1386
02:22:30,041 --> 02:22:31,959
Lieutenant Walker!

1387
02:25:28,177 --> 02:25:30,470
Commander Ferraday...

1388
02:25:30,763 --> 02:25:34,975
you may send your medical man
to attend to your lieutenant.

1389
02:25:35,309 --> 02:25:36,935
Benning.

1390
02:25:51,826 --> 02:25:55,454
And you, colonel, can pick up your man.

1391
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:09,050
Commander Ferraday,
the capsule has been destroyed.

1392
02:26:09,218 --> 02:26:13,889
Our mission is therefore accomplished.
At least in part.

1393
02:26:14,432 --> 02:26:19,227
Your mission is also accomplished
to the same degree.

1394
02:26:20,271 --> 02:26:23,732
It is unfortunate
that the officer was shot...

1395
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:26,985
apparently by accident.

1396
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:32,282
Yes.

1397
02:26:33,743 --> 02:26:38,288
Further conflict between us
would be pointless.

1398
02:26:39,207 --> 02:26:42,542
I've given the command
to my fighter planes to return to base.

1399
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:46,129
My men and myself will be picked up
within the hour.

1400
02:26:46,506 --> 02:26:48,590
Then we'll be on our way.

1401
02:26:50,885 --> 02:26:53,428
You're a long way from home.

1402
02:26:53,763 --> 02:26:56,264
We both are, commander.

1403
02:27:01,062 --> 02:27:03,021
Until you meet again.

1404
02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:05,440
Yes.

1405
02:27:08,152 --> 02:27:09,820
Until we meet again.
