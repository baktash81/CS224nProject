1
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:24,814
-What's that ambulance doing there?
-I don't know. I'll check it out.

2
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,581
-Evening, sir.
-How's it going, Griff?

3
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:44,832
I can't complain... and won't.

4
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,294
Is that him?

5
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,421
Yep. Might just be some crackpot but
I figured I should call you anyway.

6
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,257
Did he ask for me by name?

7
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:53,967
Nope, asked for the agent
in charge of

8
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:57,013
the "God's Hand" case. Said he had
some important info on it.

9
00:03:57,513 --> 00:04:00,681
-Didn't say what?
-Nope. Said he'd only talk to you.

10
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:09,900
You the agent in charge of
the "God's Hand" case?

11
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,401
That's right.
Wesley Doyle.

12
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,489
That a picture
of you and your mother, huh?

13
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,036
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
take things off my desk.

14
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,078
Sorry about that.

15
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,207
Guess I've been in here a while.

16
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,168
Already had a look at all
your plaques and your citations.

17
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,213
Didn't really care
to have a look at those.

18
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,140
What can I do for you, Mr...?

19
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,350
Meiks.

20
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,392
My name's Fenton Meiks.

21
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,855
Now listen, this may sound
a little bit crazy but...

22
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:55,028
I know who
the "God's Hand" killer is.

23
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,615
All right, I'll bite.

24
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,783
Who?

25
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:03,870
You haven't even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me.

26
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:06,664
Why is that?

27
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,086
Because in a case like this
nobody just walks in the office

28
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:13,923
and tells you who the killer is.
It doesn't happen that way.

29
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:19,846
-Sometimes truth defies reason.
-Yeah?

30
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,721
So who is it then?

31
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:24,684
My brother.

32
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:27,978
What makes you think that?

33
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,648
I got a call from him...

34
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,275
last night.

35
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,367
Hello?

36
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:46,289
<i>-Hello?
-Demons are taking over the world.</i>

37
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:50,041
Adam?

38
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,836
I can't destroy them all.

39
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:56,088
<i>-I can't take it anymore!
-Now, let's talk about this, Adam.</i>

40
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,176
But there's nothing to talk about!

41
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,177
<i>It's over...
whatever happens,</i>

42
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,266
you have to take me to the rose
garden. You promised, remember?

43
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,436
<i>-Now, that's just till...
-Remember?.</i>

44
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,061
You promised!

45
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,558
Meat?

46
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,435
That's where all this took place.

47
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,230
It's about 200 miles west of here,
just north of Abilene.

48
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,357
Why did you go to Thurman?

49
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,110
To bury Adam,
in the rose garden.

50
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,153
Why would you do that?

51
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:03,533
I promised him I would.
A long time ago.

52
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,202
That's a pretty
wild story, Mr. Meiks.

53
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,832
I don't see what, if anything,
this has got to do with my case.

54
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:15,502
Adam is the "God's Hand" killer,
Agent Doyle.

55
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,046
He's the one you're looking for.

56
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:22,926
Did he tell you that before
he asked you to take him to Thurman?

57
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,680
If that's the case,
you left that part out.

58
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,305
I haven't finished yet.

59
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,849
-Oh, there's more?
-A lot more.

60
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,270
Excuse me a minute.

61
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:47,952
Meat Sheriff's office.

62
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:51,912
Can I talk to a sheriff, please?
This is Agent Doyle of the FBI.

63
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:55,542
He's not in right now.
May I help you?

64
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,588
Well, I've got a man here
in my office, name of Fenton Meiks.

65
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:02,006
Fenton Meiks?
What's he doing there?

66
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:07,137
<i>-You know him?
-He caused a ruckus here earlier.</i>

67
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:10,348
<i>He stole an ambulance
and his brother's body too.</i>

68
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,021
Did my story check out?

69
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:19,859
Yeah, it did.

70
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:22,360
So am I under arrest now?

71
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:25,489
You damn sure should be.

72
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:31,245
The sheriff's willing to forget it
if you bring that ambulance back.

73
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,914
Nobody wants to press any charges.

74
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:39,002
-Well you gotta love small towns.
-Why would you go to all that

75
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,589
trouble just to walk in here
and confess it to me?

76
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,342
I'm here because I can't live
with what I know anymore.

77
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,347
What exactly do you know?

78
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,061
That is your mother, isn't it?

79
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:58,689
-Yeah, it is.
-I knew it.

80
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,358
You got the same eyes.

81
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,819
Why don't we
get back to your story?

82
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:06,488
What makes you think

83
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:08,531
that your brother's
the "God's Hand" killer?

84
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:10,951
I know it was him.

85
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,911
How do you know?

86
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,873
It started back in Thurman.

87
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,212
It was near
the summer of 1979.

88
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:57,413
<i>I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart.</i>

89
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,417
You're supposed to say, "Where?"

90
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,877
I don't want
to sing that dumb song.

91
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:04,255
You don't have to sing.
Just say "Where?"

92
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:05,547
All right. Where?

93
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:08,299
Not now. I'll point
to you when it's time.

94
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,304
<i>I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart.</i>

95
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,305
-Where?
-Down in my heart.

96
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,433
<i>-Where?
-Down in my heart.</i>

97
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:19,935
<i>I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart.</i>

98
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:25,357
<i>And if the devil doesn't
like it, he can sit on a tack.</i>

99
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,903
<i>-Ouch!
-Sit on a tack.</i>

100
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:28,695
<i>-Ouch!
-Sit on a tack.</i>

101
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:33,450
<i>And if the devil doesn't like it,
he can sit on a tack today.</i>

102
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,997
-Who was that chick that threw up?
-Katie Hagen. She's sure pretty.

103
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,624
-It was real messy though.
-Oh, yeah.

104
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,295
All over the floor!
And when the principal fell...

105
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,299
<i>I got the joy, joy, joy, joy...</i>

106
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,718
<i>We lived right behind
the Thurman Public Rose Garden</i>

107
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,388
<i>in the house where they used to keep
the gardeners back in the fifties.</i>

108
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:59,185
<i>Dad had gotten a good deal on it
back when he and Mom got married.</i>

109
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,441
<i>The unexpected incident that
creates those dangerous moments.</i>

110
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,692
<i>The ropes were suddenly
off the alligator.</i>

111
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:10,863
<i>Adam was 3 years
younger than me.</i>

112
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,448
<i>Our Mom died
giving birth to him, so</i>

113
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,244
<i>I basically took care
of him ever since I can remember.</i>

114
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,165
<i>Our Dad worked as a mechanic
over in Jupiter.</i>

115
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:26,337
<i>He usually got home around 5.30
and we'd all have dinner together.</i>

116
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,423
-Hey, kiddos.
-Hey, Dad.

117
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,426
Something sure smells good.

118
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,392
-How was your day?
-It was all right.

119
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,521
Let's eat.

120
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,985
-Whoa, Tiger. Save some for us.
-I sure love peas.

121
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:53,739
You must. You better be careful,
though. You might turn into one.

122
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:59,370
-How did you do on that math test?
-I barely passed.

123
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,248
Well, I was never
any good at math either.

124
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,127
Shoot, I still can't do
anything without a calculator.

125
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,545
Yeah, but there's going
to be another test next week.

126
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:12,591
-And that one's going to be harder.
-Hey, don't sound so glum.

127
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,888
Tell you what,
we'll sit down this weekend

128
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,639
and we'll see if we can't figure out
that junk together, okay?

129
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,059
All right.

130
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:27,648
Hey, Fenton. Can we go see
"Meatballs" after school tomorrow?

131
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:31,483
-We've already seen it.
-I want to see it again.

132
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,029
Nah, we're gonna go
see "The Warriors."

133
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,198
-Can't. It's rated R.
-We'll sneak in.

134
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,701
Teeth all brushed?

135
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,955
You sure about that, Adam?
All right.

136
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,498
Breath test time.

137
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,209
Dad!
I did

138
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:50,545
-brush them!
-I'm just joking with you, egghead!

139
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,008
Don't worry, Fenton. I know
you're too big for a goodnight kiss.

140
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:56,760
Sleep tight.

141
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:58,594
Don't let those bedbugs bite.

142
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:01,556
That's right.
Love you guys.

143
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,766
-Love you too, Dad.
-Night, Dad.

144
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:05,561
Night, Curtis.

145
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,441
I wanna see "Meatballs" again.

146
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,026
Fine, you can see "Meatballs"

147
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,027
and I'll see "The Warriors."

148
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,114
But I don't like
to watch movies by myself.

149
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,699
Too bad.

150
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:21,827
Please?

151
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:26,288
All right.
Just go to bed.

152
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,298
<i>That was our family.
Just the three of us.</i>

153
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,179
<i>All of Mom and Dad's relatives had
died, so there was no one but us.</i>

154
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:43,432
<i>We didn't mind though.</i>

155
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:46,059
<i>We didn't need anybody else.</i>

156
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:47,643
<i>We were happy</i>

157
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,897
<i>together. Until...</i>

158
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:52,940
-Fenton, wake up.
-Dad?

159
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:55,443
-I've got something to tell you.
-What's wrong?

160
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,486
It's okay.

161
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,946
Adam, wake up and listen.

162
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,534
I need you both
to listen to me very carefully.

163
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,368
Something's happened.

164
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,040
<i>He said he'd had
a vision that night.</i>

165
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,878
<i>A vision from God.</i>

166
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:40,572
<i>An angel came to him</i>

167
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,740
<i>and told him
the truth of this world</i>

168
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,454
<i>and revealed God's
special purpose for our family.</i>

169
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,666
The end of the world
is coming. It's near.

170
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,542
The angel showed me.

171
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:56,963
There are demons among us.

172
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,590
The devil has released them
for the final battle.

173
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:02,427
It's being fought right now.

174
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,807
But nobody knows it
except us and others like us.

175
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:12,021
-I'm scared, Dad.
-There's nothing to be afraid of.

176
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:16,901
We've been chosen by God. He will
protect us. He's given us special

177
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,360
jobs to do.

178
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:23,281
We don't fear these demons,
we destroy them.

179
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:27,286
We pick them up one by one, and
we pitch them out of this world.

180
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,247
That's God's purpose for us.

181
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:33,042
The angel called us "God's Hands."

182
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,043
So we're like superheroes?

183
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:36,753
That's right.

184
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,673
We're a family of superheroes
that are gonna help save the world.

185
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:43,300
But, Dad, that
doesn't make any sense.

186
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,847
I know it sounds that way,
son, but it's the truth.

187
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,976
So what are our superpowers?

188
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:52,394
Well...

189
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:57,148
we can see the demons
while other people can't.

190
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:02,821
The angel told me God would send us
3 weapons to destroy them with.

191
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,530
Magical weapons?

192
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,450
I imagine so.

193
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:10,202
When do we get them?

194
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,456
I don't know.
The angel just said soon.

195
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:18,336
That's all I was told, except
we're not supposed to tell anybody.

196
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:19,963
Absolutely no one.

197
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:24,009
If we do, we put them
and ourselves in danger.

198
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:27,972
Fenton?

199
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,516
Don't worry, it's okay.
It's a lot to understand.

200
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:37,730
I waited to tell you until I had
a chance to figure it out myself.

201
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:41,026
But the angel said
I had to do it now.

202
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,152
Fenton?

203
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,365
<i>I didn't know
what to say or how to feel.</i>

204
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:52,037
Do you understand what I told you?
Judgment Day is here.

205
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:56,083
<i>It was too messed up
to understand or even acknowledge.</i>

206
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,671
Soon we'll all be in Heaven.
You, me, Adam. With Mommy.

207
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,590
<i>I didn't realize it at the moment,
at least not consciously...</i>

208
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,132
She's waiting
to see us in Heaven.

209
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,887
<i>but my happy and mostly secure world
had just been flipped over.</i>

210
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,599
<i>-And there were dark things there.
-Judgment Day is here.</i>

211
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,016
<i>Very dark things.</i>

212
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,227
We've been chosen by God.

213
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,605
<i>And my little boy's mind
just couldn't take it.</i>

214
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,154
Adam! Fenton!

215
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,368
Up and at'em, boys!

216
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,465
Morning, kiddo.
Hey, come on,

217
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:46,591
lazybones. It's late.
We overslept.

218
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:51,388
Let's go.
Snap to it and

219
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:54,890
get dressed. I gotta get to work.
Drop you guys off on the way.

220
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:58,186
What's wrong with you?

221
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,275
Nothing.

222
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,293
Hey, let me have a bite of that.

223
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:28,843
<i>None of us mentioned it.
It was only a dream, a nightmare.</i>

224
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,640
<i>Nothing that crazy could be real.</i>

225
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:38,142
<i>Everything was okay,
just like before.</i>

226
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:49,278
Have a good day at school, boys.
And remember not to tell anyone.

227
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:51,073
We won't, Dad. Bye.

228
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:05,252
<i>Okay, now. I want you all to copy
down this sentence. We're gonna go</i>

229
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,924
through the structure.
"The girl in

230
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,217
the blue dress..."

231
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,388
<i>I refused to believe it.</i>

232
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:19,142
<i>-"walked..."
-That next week was a dream too.</i>

233
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
"her...

234
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,981
brown dog."

235
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,653
<i>Like when Dad started bringing
home the "magical" weapons.</i>

236
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,780
<i>He was on his way to work...</i>

237
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,493
<i>when God called to him.</i>

238
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:23,330
Be careful.

239
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:28,836
I still can't understand
what these gloves are for though.

240
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:37,053
<i>Just a long, long dream.</i>

241
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,349
I want you to write this down at the
Top of your pages in big letters.

242
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:46,314
Boys! Boys, look at this.

243
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,237
We got them all.

244
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,991
It won't be long now.

245
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,618
The angel came again
last night and told me

246
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:04,039
that God will be sending us
a list of the first 7 demons soon.

247
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,957
<i>It wasn't real.
It couldn't be.</i>

248
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,377
<i>I just had to wait it out.</i>

249
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,843
-Come over here a minute, Fenton.
-I'm washing dishes.

250
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:21,097
That can wait. Come here.
I want to talk to you.

251
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:40,074
I know you've had some trouble
adjusting to everything.

252
00:21:40,243 --> 00:21:41,743
And I'm sorry.

253
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:45,287
But God has willed this
and we must obey God.

254
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,167
Maybe you just dreamed it.

255
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:54,089
I didn't dream it. I wouldn't
make up something like that, son.

256
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:57,885
Maybe...

257
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:04,391
Maybe you're not
right in the head.

258
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:07,560
It happened, Fenton.
It's true.

259
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,272
You'll see that soon.

260
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:15,402
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. I got the first list.

261
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:21,199
<i>The angel came to him
while he was at work.</i>

262
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:35,691
Dad,

263
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:39,361
-these are people's names.
-That's right.

264
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,822
And they'll look
like people too.

265
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:43,406
But they're not.

266
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:48,495
The angel said
when I lay my hands on them

267
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,497
I'll reveal them
for what they truly are.

268
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,792
That's what the gloves are for.

269
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,252
I get them and bring them
back here with the gloves on,

270
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:59,631
and once they're back here, I take
the gloves off and reveal them.

271
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,928
You'll see.
Then you'll believe.

272
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:06,012
Does anyone know
what this word means?

273
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:07,888
Do you remember
what this word means?

274
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:12,143
<i>The dream had finally ended.
It was all real.</i>

275
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,482
<i>And I had to stop him.</i>

276
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:23,362
<i>The obvious answer was to tell
someone what he was planning.</i>

277
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:25,658
<i>But I couldn't do that.</i>

278
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:29,535
<i>I loved him even
if he had gone crazy.</i>

279
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:32,122
Dad, look, I got a list too.

280
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,499
Where did you get this, Adam?

281
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,127
God gave it to me.

282
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:43,592
Isn't Travis Shed that boy that was
picking on you at school last week?

283
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,259
He's a demon.

284
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:48,180
Tell the truth, Adam.

285
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:51,098
You made this list up
yourself, didn't you?

286
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:53,352
-No, God did.
-Adam?

287
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,729
Come on, right here.

288
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:00,066
Now, listen to me, son.

289
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,735
You can't make stuff like that up.

290
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,071
We destroy demons.

291
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,576
If we were to use your list,
we'd be killing people.

292
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:10,994
And we can never do that.

293
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,704
Now, destroying demons
is a good thing.

294
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:15,082
Killing people is bad.

295
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,458
You understand?

296
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,292
I'm sorry, Dad.

297
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,379
That's all right.
It's okay.

298
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:24,048
You just got to have
a little patience. Don't worry.

299
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:26,676
God will send you
your own list when you're older.

300
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:28,970
Okay. Go do some homework.

301
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:42,276
<i>The only thing
left to do was to tell.</i>

302
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,242
<i>That was easier said than done.</i>

303
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:10,179
<i>Dad had promised to take us
to the movies that night,</i>

304
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:14,767
<i>but he didn't come home from work.</i>

305
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,019
When's Dad coming home?

306
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,353
I don't know.

307
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:23,983
Think he's destroying a demon?

308
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,529
-It's all make-believe, Adam.
-No, it's not. It's true.

309
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:31,659
Listen to me. None of that demon
junk is real. Daddy just made it up.

310
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:34,870
-No, he didn't.
-He did too.

311
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:37,582
Just like Santa Claus.

312
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:41,836
You remember when you caught Dad
putting our presents under the tree?

313
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,379
It's just like that.

314
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:46,547
Adam,

315
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:47,967
have I ever lied to you?

316
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,136
All right, look.

317
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:55,432
Dad made up this whole thing. The
names on his list are real people.

318
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,266
Do you understand?

319
00:26:57,433 --> 00:27:00,312
-But why would he make it up?
-I don't know.

320
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:03,564
But I think we should leave.

321
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:06,693
You mean... run away?

322
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,405
Will you go with me?
Only for

323
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:12,532
-a little while.
-I don't want to leave Dad.

324
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:14,450
Neither do I.

325
00:27:15,953 --> 00:27:17,496
But we might have to.

326
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:19,121
Why?

327
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:26,214
Dad's gonna kill somebody.

328
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,446
Son, come over here.

329
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,702
Come on, I need your help.

330
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:02,933
Dad?

331
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:05,146
Come on out here, Adam.

332
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,861
Shine that light over here.

333
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:18,116
Hey, Dad, who is that?

334
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:20,576
That's a demon, son.

335
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:26,417
Come on in here, boys.
It's all right.

336
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:29,085
Goon, don't be afraid.

337
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:52,275
<i>God came to him earlier that day
and told him that the time had come.</i>

338
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,030
<i>After work he drove
down to Jacksonville,</i>

339
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,909
<i>about 45 minutes or so
southwest of Thurman.</i>

340
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:06,039
<i>He said he'd never been there before
but he had no problem finding it.</i>

341
00:30:06,998 --> 00:30:08,500
<i>God was leading him.</i>

342
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:41,449
-Cynthia Harbridge?
-Yes?

343
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:57,090
-Dad, don't. Please don't.
-Fenton,

344
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:00,052
if I could spare
you this, I would.

345
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:05,266
But we are God's servants
and His will must be served.

346
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,063
Don't be afraid, son.

347
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,629
Is that true?

348
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,674
Why would I make it up?

349
00:31:41,092 --> 00:31:42,801
Where's your father now?

350
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:45,722
Dead.

351
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,061
Sir, I was thinking
about heading out.

352
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,187
Unless you need me to stay.

353
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,104
No.

354
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:56,942
That's all right.
You go ahead.

355
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,026
Have a good night, sir.

356
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:11,666
So he killed that woman
right there in front of you?

357
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,543
But not to his way of thinking.

358
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:19,172
You see, to him he hadn't killed
a woman, he'd destroyed a demon.

359
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,553
He believed that when
he laid his hands on her,

360
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:26,512
it revealed her sins.

361
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,071
Dad, don't! Please!

362
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:13,995
No, Adam.

363
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,918
Do it like this.

364
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:25,173
It's gotta be done
in a certain way.

365
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,132
The angel was real specific.

366
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:30,011
Why out here
in the rose garden?

367
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:31,888
God chose it.

368
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,392
Just like He chose us, I suppose.

369
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:38,394
Don't cry for her, Fenton.

370
00:34:38,602 --> 00:34:40,897
She wasn't human.

371
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,902
Didn't you see
when I touched her?

372
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,237
I saw it, Dad.

373
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,577
You killed her.

374
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,539
I didn't kill her, son.

375
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:58,623
I destroyed her.
She was a demon.

376
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,837
You know, I wasn't so sure
I could do it myself.

377
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:07,383
I mean, she looked like
a woman to me too.

378
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,551
But after I touched her,

379
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,763
all I could see was the evil.

380
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:15,056
And I had to do it.

381
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:19,144
I'm sorry you
didn't see it too.

382
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,395
You will next time.

383
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:24,149
You... you're gonna do it again?

384
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:28,529
This is our job now, son.

385
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,739
You've got to accept that.

386
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:32,364
I won't let you.

387
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:36,578
-We are doing God's work here.
-I'll tell.

388
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:40,166
If you do, someone will die.

389
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,417
The angel was clear on that.
Do you understand?

390
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:46,588
Answer me, Fenton.
Do you understand?

391
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:52,093
So you didn't tell?

392
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,513
No. I should have,
but I was afraid.

393
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:59,434
I mean, I loved my father,
but I was terrified of him.

394
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:01,896
So now you understand

395
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:04,397
why I know my brother
is the "God's Hand" killer?

396
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,318
Have you got
any physical proof?

397
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:10,278
I read in the paper

398
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:15,450
that only one of the bodies of the 6
victims had been found. Is it true?

399
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,371
You read it
in the papers, didn't you?

400
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:20,372
It doesn't necessarily
mean it's true.

401
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,456
Well, in this case it does.

402
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:26,336
See, the first victim
was found mutilated

403
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:29,674
with a note saying that
God's Hand had taken him.

404
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:33,509
All the rest, only notes
were found. No bodies.

405
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:35,846
How do you know they're dead?

406
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:37,138
Oh, we don't for sure.

407
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:41,768
But the first note said we wouldn't
find any more bodies from then on.

408
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:43,769
Said

409
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,398
he wanted to keep them.

410
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:50,945
I got a pretty good idea
where the rest of them bodies are.

411
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,197
The rose garden?

412
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:59,494
Now why didn't you
tell me that in the first place?

413
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,914
Would you have believed me?

414
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:05,499
Come on.

415
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:22,391
Here.

416
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:27,147
What's this?

417
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:29,775
Put them on.

418
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,110
Or I'll put them on for you.

419
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:43,747
Let's go.

420
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,540
So tell me something.

421
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,794
Why didn't you come see me sooner?

422
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:34,421
You're gonna wanna
get on 30 east up here.

423
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:40,513
I can't imagine how you can keep
something like that inside so long.

424
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:43,557
I guess I avoided it

425
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,227
because I wanted to.

426
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:57,405
You never did tell me why it is you
just keep one picture of your mother

427
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:58,780
in your office.

428
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:08,583
My mother was murdered a couple days
after that picture was taken.

429
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:14,337
Butchered by some whacked-out
killer like your dad.

430
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,676
Did they ever catch him?

431
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,720
No.

432
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,932
Is that why you took this job?

433
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:30,396
You're pretty good at this.
You ever think about becoming a cop?

434
00:39:33,273 --> 00:39:34,984
Well, you know,
when I was a kid.

435
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:38,820
Well, you got
the instincts for it.

436
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:41,865
A cop's gotta have
good instincts.

437
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:45,159
You know what mine
are telling me now?

438
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:49,331
You're hiding
something from me.

439
00:39:51,332 --> 00:39:52,918
What is it
you think I'm hiding?

440
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:57,590
Why don't you just keep talking?
Maybe I'll figure it out.

441
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,309
<i>You okay, Dad?</i>

442
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:13,020
<i>I'm all right, son.
Here I come.</i>

443
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,153
<i>Dad, why did God
let this happen to me?</i>

444
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,905
<i>Don't blame God, Davy.
It wasn't His fault.</i>

445
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,575
<i>God let me do it.</i>

446
00:40:24,742 --> 00:40:28,328
<i>What God lets you do is decide
for yourself what you will do.</i>

447
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:32,541
<i>-You're not a puppet with strings.
-No.</i>

448
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,419
<i>So God doesn't make
you do anything.</i>

449
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,004
<i>He wants you
to decide for yourself.</i>

450
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:41,717
<i>After that night,
nothing much happened.</i>

451
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,845
<i>Dad didn't mention it
anymore. Neither did Adam.</i>

452
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,433
<i>Once a full month had gone by, I'd
completely convinced myself it was</i>

453
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,395
<i>over and everything
was gonna be all right.</i>

454
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:56,730
-Bye.
-See you all later.

455
00:40:57,483 --> 00:40:59,276
Did you see
"Dukes of Hazard" last night?

456
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:01,194
Remember when Daisy Duke bent over?

457
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:03,364
I like Boss Hogg.
He's funny.

458
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:06,907
Man, I'd do anything
to really see her tits.

459
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,162
-Ahhh... you said "tits."
-Shut up, Adam.

460
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:13,205
You wanna spend the night tonight?
We can wrap Corey's house.

461
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:17,002
-I'll have to ask Dad though.
-My mom can ask if you want.

462
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:19,003
-Sure.
-I'll see you in a little bit.

463
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:21,756
-Bye.
-Hey, what's "wrap" mean?

464
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:24,508
Tell you later.
Come on, I'll race you.

465
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:42,444
Come on!

466
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,404
No, I'm gonna go
round on the road.

467
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,310
-Dad?
-In here.

468
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:18,646
Whose van is that out there?

469
00:42:18,854 --> 00:42:20,815
Ours. Ain't she a beauty?

470
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,610
You friend's mom just called.

471
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,530
I told her not tonight.

472
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:29,990
We got some work
To do in the morning.

473
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:48,552
<i>Dad told us that there were moments
when people could just disappear</i>

474
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,970
<i>without anyone knowing
where they went or why.</i>

475
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:55,559
<i>He said those were the moments
when God's Hands could take you.</i>

476
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:59,771
<i>According to Dad, nothing,
not even a camera, could catch us.</i>

477
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,106
<i>We were invisible</i>

478
00:43:01,273 --> 00:43:03,023
<i>when we were God's Hands.</i>

479
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:05,360
What do we do now, Dad?

480
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:09,699
We'll get him when he comes out
just like I told you, remember?

481
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:11,658
Fenton?

482
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:15,912
-I can't do this, Dad.
-"Can't" never could do anything.

483
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:18,039
-I can do it, Dad.
-You sure can,

484
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:19,165
tiger.

485
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:23,628
-Well, what if someone sees us?
-They won't.

486
00:43:23,836 --> 00:43:28,341
-It's broad daylight.
-God will blind them for us.

487
00:44:07,464 --> 00:44:08,964
There he is, boys.

488
00:44:10,842 --> 00:44:12,761
-Come on, Fenton.
-Dad, I can't.

489
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:16,223
Yes, you can. Now move.
Do what I tell you!

490
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:28,026
Please, Trixie!
Trixie, come on!

491
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,444
Come, Trixie!
Trixie, come on!

492
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:32,073
What you doing, boy?

493
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:33,698
My dog...

494
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:35,741
she's under your car.

495
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:38,203
Oh, well, let's see.

496
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:46,002
Help me grab his legs.

497
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:50,340
Help me grab his legs now!
Come on!

498
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,096
Edward March.

499
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:00,684
You think that's
an innocent man there,

500
00:45:00,851 --> 00:45:02,852
don't you?
Well, it's not.

501
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:31,088
You didn't think anyone

502
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:33,008
knew about that, did you?

503
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:35,551
-But God saw you.
-Dad, don't! Please!

504
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:36,804
Quiet!

505
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:40,640
And you can't escape God's wrath!

506
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:02,370
Can't believe
you still didn't see it.

507
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:05,624
He was the murderer
of little children, Fenton.

508
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,584
Babies.

509
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:13,923
Babies.

510
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:25,643
He's the murderer.

511
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:27,771
We gotta get out of here, Adam.

512
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:30,523
-What do you mean?
-Gotta run away.

513
00:46:32,151 --> 00:46:33,652
Told you we might have to.

514
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:35,695
I don't wanna run away.

515
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:41,159
-We have to.
-Why?

516
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:44,830
Listen to me, Adam.

517
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:48,209
-Dad kills people.
-No, he doesn't.

518
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:51,169
-He's a demon slayer.
-That's all lies, Adam.

519
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:54,340
No, it's not.
I see it when he touches them.

520
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:59,009
No, you don't. Dad's brainwashed
you. It's all a big lie.

521
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,805
He's a murderer
and you help him.

522
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:05,852
No! We're just serving God's will.
I'm telling Dad on you!

523
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,686
Adam! Adam! Adam!

524
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:35,005
Get up and get dressed.

525
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:37,633
And don't wake your brother.

526
00:47:50,645 --> 00:47:51,771
Sit down.

527
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:00,656
Your brother told me
what you said last night.

528
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:07,913
I want you to know I've never
killed anything in my whole life.

529
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:10,206
That's a lie
and you know it.

530
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:18,298
I did a lot of thinking
and praying after you went to bed.

531
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:23,553
I asked the angel to visit you.

532
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:26,680
But instead he visited me.

533
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:33,314
And he told me something...
I don't want to believe.

534
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:38,152
What?

535
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:42,238
It doesn't matter.

536
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:45,283
Because together you and I
are gonna prove him wrong.

537
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:49,914
You just don't have any faith.

538
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:52,415
That's why
you can't see the truth.

539
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:57,045
But we're gonna change that.

540
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:16,357
I want you to dig
a hole right here.

541
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:20,235
Need to be
about 10 feet deep and

542
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:22,864
15 feet wide on both sides.

543
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:26,991
The length and the width
should form a perfect square.

544
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:30,829
-What?
-You heard me.

545
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:34,708
Why?

546
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:38,838
Because I'm your father and you'll
do what I tell you. Understand?

547
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,798
-Do you?
-Yes, sir.

548
00:49:43,507 --> 00:49:48,220
All right. I expect half that to be
dug by the time I get home tonight.

549
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,765
-Dad, I can't do that.
-Pray!

550
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:13,455
<i>I started digging that goddamn
hole, but I did not pray.</i>

551
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,206
<i>I would not.</i>

552
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:18,293
<i>I hated God,
I despised Him.</i>

553
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:22,215
<i>My hatred helped me dig,
kept me going.</i>

554
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,012
<i>Dad's or God's or whoever's plan
it was, it would not work on me.</i>

555
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:30,931
<i>I knew what Dad
was doing was wrong,</i>

556
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:33,059
<i>and nothing
was gonna change that.</i>

557
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:35,519
Fenton?

558
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:39,856
Sorry I told on you.

559
00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:50,784
-You tell him about running away?
-No.

560
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:52,035
Will you go with me then?

561
00:50:52,244 --> 00:50:53,577
There's no reason to go.

562
00:50:53,744 --> 00:50:56,123
-He's a killer.
-No, he's not.

563
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:00,419
I've been praying for you.
Have you been praying?

564
00:51:00,586 --> 00:51:02,754
Nope, and I'm not going to!

565
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:05,381
-But Dad said...
-I don't care what Dad said!

566
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:09,344
He might be able to make me dig
this hole but he can't make me pray.

567
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,765
Just get out of here
and leave me alone.

568
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,308
I'll help you if you promise
you won't tell Dad.

569
00:51:16,517 --> 00:51:18,270
-I don't want your help.
-But there's another

570
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:20,730
-shovel in the shed.
-Get out of here!

571
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:21,856
Butthole!

572
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,656
<i>I wanted to run away...
far away, but</i>

573
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:32,241
<i>I still couldn't leave Adam,
no matter how crazy Dad was turning.</i>

574
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:36,079
<i>Besides, there was nowhere to go.</i>

575
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:17,413
-Finally gave up, huh, kiddo?
-I'll be there again in the morning.

576
00:52:18,414 --> 00:52:20,457
Come on,
I didn't mean it like that.

577
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:22,541
I don't want
to fight with you, son.

578
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,670
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

579
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:27,755
Wish you could understand that.

580
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:33,971
What's the matter with you?

581
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:35,764
-Nothing.
-Let me see your hands.

582
00:52:35,972 --> 00:52:37,432
-They're fine.
-Let me see them.

583
00:52:38,974 --> 00:52:40,477
Didn't you wear gloves today?

584
00:52:40,644 --> 00:52:42,646
I didn't need them. I'm fine.

585
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:50,738
Here.

586
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:54,074
Help ease the pain.

587
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,327
I said I was fine.

588
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:02,124
I know you're mad at me but that's
no reason to cause yourself pain.

589
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,421
I got an extra pair
of work gloves in the shed.

590
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,506
I want you to use
these from now on.

591
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,677
It won't do you any good now that
you've wrecked your hands, but

592
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:15,428
a couple of days
and you'll be fine.

593
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,725
I want you to know
I'm proud of you.

594
00:53:21,017 --> 00:53:22,895
And I know God's
proud of you too.

595
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:28,651
Take some time off and let
those blisters callous over.

596
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,735
Then you can get
back to it, all right?

597
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:38,325
Well, good night then.

598
00:53:40,246 --> 00:53:41,955
Come on, tiger.
Bedtime.

599
00:53:42,747 --> 00:53:45,126
Fenton gets to stay up.
Please, Dad?

600
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:46,751
Come on.

601
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:51,756
Brush your teeth. I'll be in
to say goodnight in a minute.

602
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:00,514
<i>I kept digging.</i>

603
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:03,852
<i>My hands bled,
but I wouldn't stop.</i>

604
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:14,654
<i>I kept at it morning,
noon and night for 5 days.</i>

605
00:54:15,572 --> 00:54:18,618
<i>And by the sixth day,
that hole was as dark</i>

606
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:21,077
<i>as my hatred for Dad's God.</i>

607
00:54:22,077 --> 00:54:24,040
Well, you finished it all right.

608
00:54:26,082 --> 00:54:28,375
Betcha you didn't pray once
the whole time, did you?

609
00:54:29,337 --> 00:54:30,378
Nope.

610
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:38,802
<i>We started the cellar after that.</i>

611
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:42,015
<i>At least that's
what Dad called it.</i>

612
00:54:42,891 --> 00:54:44,308
<i>But I knew better.</i>

613
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:48,355
<i>We were building
a dungeon down there.</i>

614
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:53,819
<i>We basically built
a big wooden box in the ground.</i>

615
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:56,028
Good, boys. Get it
over there. Cover it good.

616
00:54:56,155 --> 00:54:57,739
<i>Dad said it would hold.</i>

617
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,866
<i>He said God would see to it.</i>

618
00:55:01,744 --> 00:55:03,286
Get back here
and help me push!

619
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,497
Come on. Keep it going!

620
00:55:06,705 --> 00:55:10,085
Push it! Go! Go!
Keep it moving! Keep it moving!

621
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:25,600
You boys did good.
Especially you, Fenton.

622
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:28,185
No. I just did as I was told.

623
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:44,451
-Well, what do you think?
-All right.

624
00:55:48,498 --> 00:55:50,499
<i>The next night he brought
home another demon.</i>

625
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:57,758
Get down there.

626
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:06,974
It has to be done.

627
00:56:07,518 --> 00:56:09,436
It's God's will.
Come on,

628
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:11,812
do it like I showed you...
the neck first, Fenton!

629
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:28,245
Fenton, get back here!

630
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:29,707
Boy!

631
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,209
Fenton!

632
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:44,887
<i>I half expected angels or God to
come out of the night and stop me.</i>

633
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,933
<i>But I had to do it.</i>

634
00:56:48,934 --> 00:56:50,267
<i>It had to end.</i>

635
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:04,699
<i>-Hello?
-1034 to any and all units</i>

636
00:57:04,866 --> 00:57:06,201
<i>in the vicinity of Garden.</i>

637
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:09,996
<i>We have complaints of a 501 driving
on the alternate side of the street.</i>

638
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,211
Hello?

639
00:57:16,795 --> 00:57:18,087
Hello?

640
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:26,263
Take it easy, boys.
Don't break my door down.

641
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:28,514
Well, what's your problem?

642
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:32,435
Craziest thing
I've heard in a long time.

643
00:57:32,727 --> 00:57:34,311
-What are you doing?
-Calling your dad.

644
00:57:34,478 --> 00:57:36,440
-You can't.
-Yes, I can. You ought to be ashamed

645
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:40,317
-making up stories like that.
-But, it's true! I can show you!

646
00:57:44,947 --> 00:57:46,031
Come on.

647
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:47,576
Let's go.

648
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:05,343
-It's around back, under the shed.
-That's enough of that now, boy.

649
00:58:06,261 --> 00:58:10,056
-I'll put an end to this. Come on.
-No... he's around back.

650
00:58:10,432 --> 00:58:13,142
See what your dad's got
to say about all this.

651
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:23,028
What's the trouble, sheriff?

652
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:26,948
Sorry to wake you, but your boy

653
00:58:27,157 --> 00:58:28,366
here seems to have a problem.

654
00:58:33,705 --> 00:58:34,914
Come on in.

655
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:51,680
I was about to head over to Lake
Thompson, to get a jump on the bass.

656
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:55,310
And he comes running in
with this wild story.

657
00:58:56,018 --> 00:58:59,439
-Yep. It's quite a tale all right.
-It's the truth and you know it.

658
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:04,070
It makes me mad to think that he

659
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:07,154
told everyone down
at your office too.

660
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:11,159
You can set your mind at ease about
that. I was the only one there.

661
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:13,369
Course, I don't believe
a word of it.

662
00:59:14,914 --> 00:59:16,373
What does get me,
though, is why would he

663
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,541
make up such a crazy story?

664
00:59:22,212 --> 00:59:24,004
I don't know why he made it up.

665
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:29,760
Probably did it to get back at me
for punishing him earlier.

666
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:32,639
Did you tell him about that?

667
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,849
He's lying.
Just check the shed.

668
00:59:37,936 --> 00:59:39,521
I don't know what to do with him.

669
00:59:41,063 --> 00:59:44,484
Well, they hit puberty, seem
to lose all respect for you.

670
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:47,697
Me and my boys survived it.
You will too.

671
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:52,243
Just check the shed or the rose
garden. I could show you where

672
00:59:52,368 --> 00:59:56,829
-they're buried.
-Why don't you just quit all this?

673
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:58,958
Please, I can show you.

674
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:08,424
Maybe we ought to check
the shed just to quiet him down.

675
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,220
Well, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

676
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:15,474
What do you think, kiddo?

677
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:19,770
Does it have to be done?

678
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:37,787
See?

679
01:00:39,164 --> 01:00:42,959
I figured we ought to have a storm
cellar. Goon down and check it out.

680
01:00:43,126 --> 01:00:45,878
Just watch your step.
I'm not much of a carpenter.

681
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:16,743
I don't see a thing.

682
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,620
He was here.

683
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:24,625
You realize the trouble you could
get into over a thing like this?

684
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:27,879
They must have moved him
because he was here.

685
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:31,968
Adam. Adam's got him
somewhere, I know it.

686
01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:35,719
-I think I've seen enough.
-But...

687
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:38,348
I could show you where
the bodies are buried.

688
01:01:47,775 --> 01:01:49,860
Please!
You gotta believe me!

689
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:22,434
May God welcome you

690
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:25,603
and keep you.

691
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:47,374
I never killed
a man before tonight.

692
01:02:48,628 --> 01:02:49,794
I've seen you kill plenty.

693
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:53,758
Those were demons.
That was a man.

694
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:55,592
Why can't you see that?

695
01:02:55,842 --> 01:02:58,721
-You didn't have to kill him.
-I had to protect our mission.

696
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:00,555
There is no mission!

697
01:03:01,348 --> 01:03:03,349
That man is dead because of you.

698
01:03:04,058 --> 01:03:05,811
You see him?
Look at him!

699
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:08,479
He's dead because
you have no faith.

700
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,817
Do you understand
what you made me do?

701
01:03:10,942 --> 01:03:14,109
-You made me commit murder!
-I didn't make you do anything!

702
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:15,905
You did!
You're crazy!

703
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:17,572
Shut up!
You're scared!

704
01:03:17,781 --> 01:03:20,701
Dad, no!
Dad, don't!

705
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:25,037
l... I can't.

706
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,797
It's all right, Dad.

707
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:34,172
Don't cry.

708
01:03:59,157 --> 01:04:00,490
Wait a minute, Fenton.

709
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:04,787
Go on inside, son. I'll be there
in a minute to tuck you in.

710
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:07,080
Goon, it's all right.

711
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:08,540
Go.

712
01:04:14,753 --> 01:04:16,090
Come into the shed.

713
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:34,608
Come in and shut the door.

714
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:46,119
Are you afraid?

715
01:04:47,203 --> 01:04:49,248
-Of what?
-You.

716
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:53,626
Only demons should fear me.

717
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:56,505
And you're not
a demon, are you?

718
01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:00,259
The angel said you were.

719
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:06,181
But I can't believe that.
I won't.

720
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:11,604
You're my son.

721
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:14,772
And I love you more
than my own life.

722
01:05:17,734 --> 01:05:20,069
You know what's funny
about all this, Fenton?

723
01:05:22,948 --> 01:05:24,741
I'm afraid of you.

724
01:05:48,264 --> 01:05:49,433
Go on.

725
01:05:50,851 --> 01:05:53,978
-But, Dad.
-I don't want to do this, Fenton,

726
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:55,730
but I have to.

727
01:05:56,022 --> 01:05:59,819
I had to kill a man tonight.
I can't let that happen again.

728
01:05:59,986 --> 01:06:02,320
But, Dad,
I promise I won't tell.

729
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:05,700
I can't trust you.
I wish I could.

730
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,075
Now goon.

731
01:06:07,242 --> 01:06:09,660
But, Dad, I'm sorry.

732
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:16,252
I'm sorry too but this has to be
done. Now you get on down there

733
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:19,129
or I'll put you
down there myself.

734
01:06:19,296 --> 01:06:20,880
-But, Dad...
-Go!

735
01:06:22,216 --> 01:06:23,300
No!

736
01:06:26,177 --> 01:06:28,513
No! No!

737
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:33,478
Dad, please!
Dad! Dad! No, please!

738
01:06:35,187 --> 01:06:38,816
-No! Please, Dad!
-You'll stay till you see the truth.

739
01:06:39,025 --> 01:06:42,234
-Please, Dad, don't! Please, no!
-Pray to God, Fenton.

740
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:46,239
-Please, no!
-Only He can help you now.

741
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:50,077
Please, don't
do this, Dad! No!

742
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:53,662
Please! Please,
it's me, Fenton, okay?

743
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:55,999
Please don't do this.

744
01:06:57,334 --> 01:07:01,671
It's me. It's me, Fenton.
I'm not a demon! Please!

745
01:07:02,214 --> 01:07:04,340
Please, please!

746
01:07:05,927 --> 01:07:08,345
Please, no! Please!

747
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:12,225
Please, don't do this.

748
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:17,854
No! No! No, please, Dad!

749
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:35,747
Fenton?

750
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:38,709
Fenton!

751
01:07:40,877 --> 01:07:42,503
Fenton, you all right?

752
01:07:43,587 --> 01:07:44,590
Adam?

753
01:07:45,632 --> 01:07:47,425
Adam, is that you?

754
01:07:53,014 --> 01:07:53,848
Adam?

755
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,768
Adam, you gotta
get me out of here.

756
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:58,311
I can't.

757
01:07:58,603 --> 01:08:01,690
But I'm hungry
and I gotta go to the bathroom.

758
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:03,775
Dad won't let me feed you.

759
01:08:04,441 --> 01:08:06,195
I brought you
some water though.

760
01:08:06,445 --> 01:08:08,280
He says you can
have a cup a day.

761
01:08:08,697 --> 01:08:10,698
But I'll bring you
more if I can.

762
01:08:11,157 --> 01:08:15,452
Look, Adam, he's gonna kill me.
You gotta get me out of here.

763
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:17,081
I can't.

764
01:08:17,206 --> 01:08:19,207
Put your mouth
to the knothole right here.

765
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,753
You ready?

766
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:24,045
Here.

767
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:35,515
You want some more
or you want me to save it

768
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:39,312
-for later?
-More! More!

769
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:52,824
-You've gotta get me out of here.
-Dad says

770
01:08:52,991 --> 01:08:54,950
you'll probably be out
of there by the end of the week.

771
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:57,412
You just have
To accept God's will.

772
01:08:57,913 --> 01:08:59,538
A week?
I can't stay

773
01:08:59,705 --> 01:09:01,834
-in here that long.
-I'll pray for you.

774
01:09:02,918 --> 01:09:03,793
Adam?

775
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:06,214
Adam? Adam?

776
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:20,769
<i>The days came and went.</i>

777
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:27,608
<i>I counted them by the light through
the hatch door and Adam's visits.</i>

778
01:09:28,861 --> 01:09:31,571
I only slept when
I passed out from exhaustion.

779
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,408
What about your dad?

780
01:09:34,825 --> 01:09:37,244
Didn't he ever come back
To at least check on you?

781
01:09:37,827 --> 01:09:39,413
On the seventh day.

782
01:09:49,338 --> 01:09:51,175
Has God spoken to you yet?

783
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:56,888
There is no God.

784
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:16,115
<i>I lost count of the days
after that. It felt like weeks.</i>

785
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:20,954
<i>I finally went beyond fear
into total insanity.</i>

786
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:24,791
<i>I saw God.</i>

787
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,835
<i>He had finally
sent me a vision.</i>

788
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:32,007
<i>It was then that I understood my
destiny just like Dad said I would.</i>

789
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:38,554
Dad! Fenton's not answering!

790
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:43,143
Fenton? Fenton?

791
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:56,699
Fenton!

792
01:10:58,116 --> 01:10:59,242
Fenton.

793
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:02,871
What? Come on, kiddo.

794
01:11:03,872 --> 01:11:05,207
Give me that water.

795
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,629
Easy, boy.

796
01:11:11,879 --> 01:11:13,632
Easy. Easy.

797
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:16,134
Here you go, kiddo.

798
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:17,593
Here you go, buddy.

799
01:11:19,638 --> 01:11:20,806
Dad?

800
01:11:21,764 --> 01:11:23,768
I saw God!

801
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,690
Just try to take a little sip.

802
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:45,706
Slow down there. Don't want to eat
too fast, you'll make yourself sick.

803
01:11:45,957 --> 01:11:48,208
So did God
tell you about the demons?

804
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:51,504
Sorry I ever doubted you.

805
01:11:52,838 --> 01:11:54,672
I'm sorry too, son.

806
01:11:55,798 --> 01:11:57,009
What did God look like?

807
01:11:57,801 --> 01:12:00,219
-Kind of hard to describe.
-Was He big?

808
01:12:00,386 --> 01:12:01,428
Adam,

809
01:12:01,806 --> 01:12:05,433
let your brother eat in peace.
He can't explain something

810
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,687
-like that.
-But I want to know.

811
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:10,605
-Then maybe you should pray for it.
-It's not fair.

812
01:12:10,772 --> 01:12:13,151
All I've ever seen are demons,
and he gets to see God.

813
01:12:13,317 --> 01:12:16,610
That's right. But look at
the price he paid.

814
01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:20,824
That's all behind us now.

815
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:24,245
It's a new day.
Isn't it, Fenton?

816
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:27,539
So we gonna go
get us a demon now?

817
01:12:27,705 --> 01:12:31,668
After a while.
When Fenton's ready.

818
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:40,595
<i>A week later I was ready.</i>

819
01:12:42,596 --> 01:12:45,725
<i>My first demon was to be
Brad White from Dallas.</i>

820
01:12:47,726 --> 01:12:49,852
-There it is.
-I see it.

821
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,540
You're sure
you're ready for this?

822
01:13:11,499 --> 01:13:12,877
Yes, sir.

823
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:22,760
I bought these for you. You'll need
them now that God has spoken to you.

824
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:30,936
-All right, let's go.
-I want to go too, Dad.

825
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:35,608
Not this time, Adam. You stay
here and keep your eyes peeled.

826
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:38,527
Don't worry.
Your time will come.

827
01:13:41,988 --> 01:13:43,073
Let's go.

828
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:21,945
-Sorry to bother you but...
-Yeah?

829
01:14:22,195 --> 01:14:24,490
My mom and I, we got
a flat on our van.

830
01:14:26,491 --> 01:14:28,242
-Yeah.
-Well, I was wondering if you had

831
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,954
a tire iron. We went off
and left ours at home.

832
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:33,831
Hey, pal, what's
with the gloves?

833
01:14:34,248 --> 01:14:36,585
Oh, to change the tire.

834
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:39,670
-Don't want to get your hands dirty?
-Yeah.

835
01:14:39,837 --> 01:14:41,632
Brad, who is it?

836
01:14:41,841 --> 01:14:44,009
Mind your business,
you fucking bitch!

837
01:14:46,554 --> 01:14:48,221
Goddamn women.

838
01:14:52,143 --> 01:14:55,103
Yeah, I think
I got one for you.

839
01:14:56,395 --> 01:14:58,565
-Out back.
-Great.

840
01:15:03,529 --> 01:15:04,738
Back here.

841
01:15:15,582 --> 01:15:16,875
Let's see.

842
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:22,839
Here it is.

843
01:15:28,428 --> 01:15:29,428
Shit!

844
01:15:35,017 --> 01:15:36,562
Grab his legs.

845
01:16:06,508 --> 01:16:07,633
Brad White?

846
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:17,352
You know, Fenton,

847
01:16:18,686 --> 01:16:21,231
I've been waiting for this moment
ever since all this started.

848
01:16:24,777 --> 01:16:27,070
I'm ready to fulfill
my destiny.

849
01:16:29,488 --> 01:16:30,992
I'm proud of you, son.

850
01:16:41,961 --> 01:16:43,253
Fuck you!

851
01:16:44,087 --> 01:16:45,296
You fuck!

852
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:49,009
Get your fucking hands away!
Get the fuck off!

853
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:12,073
Destroy him!

854
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,522
Dad!

855
01:17:51,529 --> 01:17:53,241
Dad, no, no, no!

856
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
No!

857
01:19:01,516 --> 01:19:03,517
I buried him
in the rose garden.

858
01:19:06,897 --> 01:19:08,647
We went to the sheriff's

859
01:19:09,692 --> 01:19:11,943
office a week later
and told them

860
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,656
that Dad just didn't
come home one day.

861
01:19:19,492 --> 01:19:22,996
They filed a missing persons
but they didn't find anything.

862
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:29,419
After a while they sent us
to separate orphanages.

863
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:31,589
So,

864
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:34,841
nobody ever knew
about any of this?

865
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:36,133
No.

866
01:19:39,137 --> 01:19:40,555
Not until now.

867
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:45,477
What about Adam?
He didn't tell anybody?

868
01:19:51,608 --> 01:19:55,278
Mind if we just sit here? I don't
much feel like talking anymore.

869
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:10,438
Tell me more about that promise
you made to your brother.

870
01:21:15,274 --> 01:21:16,860
It was later on that night.

871
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:52,103
Adam?

872
01:21:55,024 --> 01:21:56,983
If you ever destroy me,

873
01:21:57,567 --> 01:21:59,654
promise me you'll bury me here.

874
01:22:00,987 --> 01:22:03,364
I promise to God
I'll bury you here.

875
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,003
I don't get it.

876
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:20,548
He promised you that
he'd bury you here?

877
01:22:21,259 --> 01:22:22,301
Yeah.

878
01:22:22,676 --> 01:22:24,177
If he killed you.

879
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:27,098
No, not killed. Destroyed.

880
01:22:27,932 --> 01:22:29,432
Don't make any sense.

881
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,478
Yes, it does.

882
01:22:38,693 --> 01:22:41,278
If that man standing
in front of you is Adam Meiks.

883
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:02,382
So you killed all those people.

884
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:07,971
No. No, I told you before, I've
never killed anyone in my life.

885
01:23:09,014 --> 01:23:10,347
Fenton was the killer.

886
01:23:10,516 --> 01:23:12,934
Just stop the bullshit
and tell me the truth.

887
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:15,394
You'll understand soon.

888
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:18,398
Just let me show you
where I buried Fenton.

889
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:19,816
Hold it.

890
01:23:23,236 --> 01:23:24,863
You take it real slow.

891
01:23:57,229 --> 01:23:58,646
That's it.

892
01:24:01,733 --> 01:24:03,068
This is the spot.

893
01:24:08,907 --> 01:24:10,658
There's too many graves here.

894
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:13,286
There's only six victims.

895
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,626
Fenton didn't bury
his victims here.

896
01:24:20,459 --> 01:24:22,088
He kept them as trophies
in his basement.

897
01:24:25,881 --> 01:24:27,343
This is where I put demons.

898
01:24:31,096 --> 01:24:32,849
You thought
your brother was a demon?

899
01:24:33,724 --> 01:24:35,058
He was.

900
01:24:38,938 --> 01:24:40,939
That's why he couldn't
see the truth.

901
01:24:43,524 --> 01:24:46,069
Dad knew it too.
He just couldn't accept it.

902
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:51,950
You see, God asked Dad
To destroy his son,

903
01:24:52,075 --> 01:24:55,288
much like He asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac.

904
01:24:57,205 --> 01:24:58,831
But Dad couldn't do it.

905
01:25:00,668 --> 01:25:03,336
And God didn't take pity
on Dad like He did Abraham.

906
01:25:10,384 --> 01:25:12,637
So He handed down
The duty to me.

907
01:25:15,764 --> 01:25:19,811
Fenton knew I'd come. That's why
he left those notes to lure me in.

908
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:25,108
I guess he figured when the killings
made the news that I'd come for him.

909
01:25:27,485 --> 01:25:30,030
<i>But I had to wait
till God put him on my list.</i>

910
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:33,993
<i>To come before that
would have been murder.</i>

911
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:26,752
Adam?

912
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,356
Jesus Christ, you really
do believe all this stuff.

913
01:26:46,898 --> 01:26:48,607
I've always believed.

914
01:26:53,655 --> 01:26:55,239
<i>That's all lies, Adam.</i>

915
01:26:56,117 --> 01:26:57,951
<i>No, it's not. I see it
when he touches them.</i>

916
01:27:37,282 --> 01:27:38,866
You're just crazy as hell.

917
01:27:39,952 --> 01:27:43,287
Fenton or Adam
or whatever your damn name is.

918
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,834
I don't really give a fuck.

919
01:27:49,835 --> 01:27:52,047
All I need to know right now

920
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:55,802
is you're a murdering
son of a bitch.

921
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,303
And I got you.

922
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:01,182
Maybe.

923
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,810
But that's not gonna bring
your mother back, is it?

924
01:28:08,563 --> 01:28:09,898
She's dead

925
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:13,110
and her killer
got away, didn't he?

926
01:28:16,195 --> 01:28:17,949
Goddamn you.
Dirty little son of a...

927
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,597
How did you know?

928
01:28:44,976 --> 01:28:46,601
You were on my list.

929
01:29:08,832 --> 01:29:11,083
You didn't think anybody
knew about that, did you?

930
01:29:12,461 --> 01:29:15,505
God knew.
That's why he sent me.

931
01:29:41,073 --> 01:29:43,742
I'm an FBI agent.

932
01:29:45,703 --> 01:29:47,787
They'll come looking for me.

933
01:29:49,455 --> 01:29:50,664
No, they won't.

934
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:54,169
They'll keep
looking for Fenton.

935
01:29:56,547 --> 01:29:58,423
You're going to be
his last victim.

936
01:30:00,008 --> 01:30:01,509
They've seen you.

937
01:30:03,553 --> 01:30:04,888
They'll know it was you.

938
01:30:15,982 --> 01:30:17,608
God will protect me.

939
01:30:35,127 --> 01:30:37,796
I can't talk right now, I can't.
I'll get back to you.

940
01:30:38,505 --> 01:30:39,922
-Here.
-Thank you.

941
01:30:41,716 --> 01:30:43,844
Are you sure neither one of you
can remember what he looks like?

942
01:30:44,052 --> 01:30:45,847
Look, I told you
it's just a blur.

943
01:30:46,514 --> 01:30:49,641
I can't understand it. I looked
right at him. I shook his hand.

944
01:30:50,182 --> 01:30:53,645
Dave, we've got a problem.
You've got to take a look at this.

945
01:30:58,316 --> 01:30:59,276
There he is.

946
01:31:00,943 --> 01:31:02,780
We got you now, buddy.

947
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:07,952
-What is this?
-All the tapes look like this.

948
01:31:09,244 --> 01:31:10,787
Goddamn it!

949
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:15,333
-We're running the name he gave you.
-It's got to be a fake name.

950
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:19,088
Sounds fake. Fenton Meiks.

951
01:31:19,672 --> 01:31:24,051
Fenton Meiks, this is the FBI!
We're coming in! Go! Go!

952
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:29,515
Clear!

953
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:44,237
-Anything?
-No.

954
01:31:44,446 --> 01:31:45,863
All right, let's dust it.

955
01:31:51,704 --> 01:31:53,288
Oh, my God.

956
01:31:56,749 --> 01:31:58,502
There's no one here, sir.

957
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,670
We found this
in the basement.

958
01:32:06,926 --> 01:32:08,262
Is he down there too?

959
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,348
Not him.

960
01:32:23,943 --> 01:32:26,780
<i>1034, possible 1070...</i>

961
01:32:30,576 --> 01:32:31,952
Excuse me.

962
01:32:32,786 --> 01:32:35,162
Didn't hear you come in.
How can I help you?

963
01:32:35,331 --> 01:32:37,541
I'm with the FBI. I need to speak
to the sheriff. Is he in?

964
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:40,209
Sure thing.
Sheriff?

965
01:32:41,963 --> 01:32:44,964
-Would you like some coffee?
-No, I'm fine, thanks.

966
01:32:49,344 --> 01:32:51,931
-Well, hey, Curtis.
-Afternoon, Becky.

967
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,776
Sheriff?

968
01:33:04,943 --> 01:33:05,861
Yeah.

969
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:11,158
I'm agent Griffin Hull of the FBI.

970
01:33:11,283 --> 01:33:13,325
I need to ask you
Some questions about your brother.

971
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:16,955
Fenton?

972
01:33:17,122 --> 01:33:18,247
Yes, sir.

973
01:33:23,128 --> 01:33:24,503
Why don't you
come on around back?

974
01:33:31,845 --> 01:33:34,263
Well, I appreciate you coming by
to tell me personally.

975
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:37,142
I just wanted you to know
before we go public.

976
01:33:38,476 --> 01:33:41,397
Well, listen, if there's anything
I can do, don't hesitate to call.

977
01:33:41,606 --> 01:33:43,607
I think we got it
pretty well covered from here.

978
01:33:43,773 --> 01:33:46,986
But again, if you can think of
anything, or if he contacts you...

979
01:33:47,195 --> 01:33:48,987
-Of course.
-All right.

980
01:33:53,492 --> 01:33:54,993
You're a good man, Agent Hull.

981
01:34:33,532 --> 01:34:35,407
Everything okay, Adam?

982
01:34:37,494 --> 01:34:39,538
Everything's just fine, Becky.

983
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:43,041
God's will has been served.

984
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:45,835
Praise God.
