1
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:17,748
Come on. Get your coat.
We gotta go.

2
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:23,750
-You have everything?
-Yeah.

3
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,945
Hurry up, sweetie.
 We're late.

4
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:33,460
Ty. Today,
 papi.

5
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,594
You're killing me, Ty.
Right now, you're killing Mommy.

6
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:40,135
-Okay, let's go.
-lt's not my fault, Mom.

7
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,266
All right. You want to do
your speech for me?

8
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:48,776
Ty! Hello?
 That's better.

9
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:51,073
You don't have to listen
to that 2 4 hours a day.

10
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:53,112
Wait.
 lt's Simon and Garfunkel.

11
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:56,447
That's why l tell you to tie your shoes.
l know. l'm sorry. Oh, my God.

12
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:59,818
-You can't just turn them off, Mom.
-l understand, baby. Come on.

13
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,563
-Careful of the puddle.
-Why'd they break up?

14
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:12,826
-Who?
-Simon and Garfunkel.

15
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:16,770
You got me.
You can Google it at school.

16
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,941
Let's go.

17
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:33,748
Will l get in trouble
if l didn't give my speech?

18
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,450
Because l'm not 
really feeling it.

19
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,686
What do you mean? You've been
working all summer on that speech.

20
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,262
-l can't wait to hear it.
-lt's boring.

21
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:44,992
Not to me or to abuela
or to your dad.

22
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,262
l thought we were 
meeting him after.

23
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:51,772
No way. He's coming, and then you
guys are going camping. Remember?

24
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:54,639
He's gonna be late,
and then everyone will see.

25
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:00,776
Look, he knows what time it starts.
Don't worry, he'll be there.

26
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,079
-Hey, look at me.
-What?

27
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:08,782
-You got something on your face there.
-Where?

28
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,450
-Right there.
-Ma! Mom! Mom, no! Stop!

29
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,722
There it is.
 l got it!

30
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,798
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-Hey, Ty.

31
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:26,465
What's up?
The speech thing is at 4:00.

32
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:29,545
l know. Come here.
You got something on your face.

33
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:31,306
-Mom!
-What?

34
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:35,884
-Please.
-l'm sorry. Mr. Cool Guy.

35
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,984
l love you.

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,460
Have a good day.

37
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,447
-Morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Cora? How my diamonds?

38
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,554
-They're hanging with your rubies.
-l like the sound of that.

39
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:56,064
-Just made it, Marisa.
-l always do.

40
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:17,352
-Good morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Keef?

41
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:21,581
How's the weather?
Sunshine. That's nice.

42
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,324
Anything good on?

43
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:30,860
He opened the door for the paper.
The wife just pushed him out.

44
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:34,401
That nasty butt first thing
in the morning, l'd kick him out too.

45
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:38,098
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. He's
one of mine, the lactose intolerant.

46
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,072
l like how you name the people.

47
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,213
What do you call me
behind my back, l wonder.

48
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,550
Yeah. Can l get a robe to the
Charles Suite ASAP? Thank you.

49
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:52,689
l call you God because you see
everything and you still smile.

50
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:57,953
-l'm cool with that. l surely am.
-l'll see you later, Keef.

51
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:04,698
A Beresford maid is expedient.
A Beresford maid is thorough.

52
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,860
A Beresford maid 
serves with a smile.

53
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:10,234
And above all, a Beresford maid
strives to be invisible.

54
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:13,774
Maybe we can disappear
one day altogether.

55
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:18,742
You know what l just heard?

56
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:21,941
Christina?
 History after the 1 st.

57
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,646
Christina kitchen or
Christina assistant manager?

58
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:26,812
Assistant manager.
You know what that means?

59
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,424
Somebody else is gonna be
busting my ass on the 2nd.

60
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:32,061
Wrong. lt means we're gonna
need an assistant manager.

61
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:37,189
-Yo, Barb, we still on for happy hour?
-Ten hours and counting.

62
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,629
Hey, Marisa,
 you here?

63
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:40,963
Can l finish getting dressed,
please? Thank you.

64
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:43,572
You're the one who keeps
talking about being a manager.

65
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,007
All l'm saying is,
 it could be you.

66
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:48,975
They're not gonna make
a maid a manager.

67
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:52,444
Why not? Today's a new day.
Anything's possible.

68
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:54,412
You know what l'm saying?

69
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:07,194
Friday morning, people!
Lots to do. Heads up.

70
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:12,701
Mr. Bextrum has an announcement
to make. Mr. Bextrum.

71
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,931
Christina Howard's promotion created
a vacancy that we've decided to fill...

72
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:19,871
...
with in-house personnel.

73
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:23,343
-Perhaps one of our butlers.
-Excuse me, Mr. Bextrum, sir?

74
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:27,917
-Yes, Miss Kehoe?
-Can a maid apply?

75
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:32,249
Technically, if an employee's been
here for three consecutive years...

76
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:35,948
...he or, indeed, she,
is qualified to apply.

77
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:40,653
So yes. Sure. Absolutely.
Why not? Anything is possible.

78
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:43,856
You hear that?
The man said anything's possible.

79
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,227
Yeah,
 l guess he did.

80
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,933
On to new business.

81
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:54,506
Mr. Radcliff is checking out of 709.
Mr. Greenwald is checking in.

82
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:58,114
He's back on the wagon,
so let's clear out the minibar.

83
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:01,645
Kanga CFO, Mr. Fukimoro,
is checking into 8 1 4.

84
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:05,914
Stock Evian, shampoo the rugs
and extra slippers for his guests.

85
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,780
Marisa, heads up
on the Madison Suite.

86
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,515
Housekeeping.

87
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:12,889
Mrs. Sage is arriving
with the children...

88
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:16,361
...preferably after Mr. Sage's
girlfriend departs.

89
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,659
You son of a bitch!

90
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:21,530
Let's make sure it's
a smooth transition.

91
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:24,572
The Guedj sisters are back.
We'll track them on surveillance...

92
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:28,677
...but do keep an eye on all
bathrobes, cutlery and light fixtures.

93
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:32,571
Sotheby's director, Caroline Lane,
has switched from the Four Seasons.

94
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,443
She requested a park view...

95
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,313
...and favors purple orchids
and lavender scents.

96
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,519
Assemblyman Chris Marshall
arrives today.

97
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,125
He's gearing up his campaign...

98
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,852
...so his suite will be doubling
as a conference center...

99
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,692
...with the liquor and coffee bars
turning over every four hours.

100
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:54,269
And he's bringing his large dog,
so we'll need proper accouterments.

101
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:58,236
And finally, Mr. Newman is back
in the Sherman Suite.

102
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:02,241
Careful, ladies,
 he's a full Monty.

103
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:09,018
-l had no idea anyone was here.
-Don't worry about it, Mr. Monty.

104
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,846
No big deal.

105
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,014
-And l do mean no big deal.
-No big deal.

106
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,797
Lavender!

107
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:27,333
-You're very creative, Marisa.
-Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:31,904
Since you have to leave at 3:00,
go find Lionel and have him sign off.

109
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,644
-Sir, l need you to sign off on the--
-Damn!

110
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:42,216
Oh, good Lord.
 Here, let me.

111
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:44,980
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

112
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,520
Oh, God.
 Your hand's bleeding.

113
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,384
Here.
 Squeeze tight.

114
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:01,433
Damn.
 He's checked in.

115
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:04,472
Quote, ''Sentimental favorite
Chris Marshall...

116
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,698
...blah, blah,
 blah...

117
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,605
...son of late Senator
Graham Marshall, blah, blah...

118
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,942
...is expected to run for his father's
seat in the next election.''

119
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:14,640
-End quote.
-Let me see that. Let me see it, Jerry.

120
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,750
You don't need to see it.
 No.

121
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,980
-Give it here.
-Fine. But l hadn't finished it yet.

122
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,053
''Sentimental favorite
and playboy politico...

123
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:26,558
...Assemblyman Chris Marshall....''
Guess you missed a few words, Jer.

124
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,322
What, ''playboy''?
That's a compliment.

125
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:32,332
''Who called off his engagement
to Ã¼ber babe Daniella Van Graas...

126
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:35,732
...arrives in town solo.''
Respectful, huh?

127
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:40,068
Well, listen, you know, you're
a public figure. lt's news. So what?

128
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:42,506
We were never engaged.
Whose side are you on?

129
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:45,273
Yours. That's why sometimes
you have to listen to me.

130
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,746
-Every now and again it might be nice.
-Here.

131
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,715
Welcome to the Beresford,
Mr. Marshall.

132
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:50,943
-Hello.
-My name is Lionel.

133
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,451
-Lionel?
-l'm the floor butler.

134
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,851
lf there's anything you need,
please call me.

135
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:58,857
Thank you. This is Jerry,
and this is Dan, and the dog is Rufus.

136
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:01,087
Thank you, Lionel.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

137
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:04,701
We'll call you if we need you. Chris,
will you look at me, please? Chris?

138
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,563
-Can you look at me for a minute?
-What? l am looking at you.

139
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:10,034
We're going to Maddox's thing
on Monday night.

140
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:11,263
No, Jerry,
 we're not.

141
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:14,534
See, this is when l wish your
old man were here to back me up.

142
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,302
-What?
-l said, l wish your old man...

143
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,414
-...were here to back me up.
-My father had no use for that man.

144
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:22,745
Your father knew how
to use that man.

145
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,947
-Where are you going?
-What?

146
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:28,182
-That depends. Where are you going?
-Bathroom. Alone.

147
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,417
-Yeah. Fine. Go. Great. Yeah. Sure.
-Thank you.

148
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:32,721
Call me if you need anything.

149
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,899
Oh, my God.

Thank you.

151
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,518
Sir.

152
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,491
Thank you. Thank you very much.
l'm so clumsy.

153
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,153
-Happens to all of us. Here.
-Thank you.

154
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:10,322
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

155
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,494
-Where do those go?
-Caroline Lane. Park Suite.

156
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,072
She just checked in with a request
for immediate unpack and press.

157
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:21,232
Here.
 Blood and Dolce:

158
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,615
Thank you.
 Thank you.

159
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:30,250
l mean,
 there are limits.

160
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:36,057
You're so bad.
 You really are, Rach.

161
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,888
Yes,
 just hold on a second.

162
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,860
Thank you. Anything, l mean,
it's up and down.

163
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,091
One day, we're looking at rings,
and the next day, we're breaking up.

164
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:47,965
Yeah. No way.

165
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:49,967
So l...

166
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:55,804
...had my assistant accidentally forward
my calendar for the week to his e-mail.

167
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:01,510
Of course, l added a few extra lunch
dates and dinner parties with my ex.

168
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,981
Fantastic,
 right?

169
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,956
Eric will be furious.

170
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,149
-That needs pressing.
-Okay.

171
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:14,890
But let's not forget Eric trades
commodities for a living.

172
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,592
A little competition right now
might increase my market value.

173
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:24,840
Listen, my darling, l'm going
to be late. l'll call you later, okay?

174
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:27,506
Excuse me.
 Sorry.

175
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:31,510
Could you just hold up those two
outfits that Dolce sent over earlier?

176
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,980
These two?

177
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:40,082
Well, l just simply can't tell
without the stockings.

178
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,288
Could l ask you 
an enormous favor?

179
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:49,530
l mean, l know this isn't your job,
and l'd never normally ask, but l'm so....

180
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:52,895
-lt's okay.
-You're such a doll.

181
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:56,096
Would you run down to Madison
and get me three pairs of pantyhose?

182
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:59,934
-The concierge usually does that.
-Yes, but it will get lost in translation.

183
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,475
Please. You look like
you're someone...

184
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,672
...who knows the difference
between taupe and caramel.

185
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,019
-Okay.
-Thanks.

186
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:13,678
Here.
 Thank you so much.

187
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,914
-Okay.
-Oh, and sorry.

188
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:19,083
Can you send someone else
to finish the unpacking, please?

189
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,355
-Right away.
-Thanks.

190
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,163
Bye.

191
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,927
Attention!
 Somebody's coming!

192
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:31,062
-You think it's gonna rain?
-Maybe. lt's possible.

193
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,605
-Hi, where's the fire?
-Nowhere.

194
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,833
l just got sent on an errand.
l'm already late.

195
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,308
-Get these pressed for me?
-Sure, in my spare time.

196
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,312
By the way, two poodles
raiding your cart.

197
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,711
-What?
-Can't be late for Ty!

198
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:52,119
Mary Anne, if you don't wear
that dress, l'm gonna come over.

199
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:55,629
l'm gonna go in your closet.
l'm gonna put it on for you.

200
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,192
Wait.
 Hold on a sec.

201
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,730
Excuse me, miss?
Where are you going?

202
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:03,235
-ln back to see if Carrie's here.
-Carrie's not here.

203
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,067
So could you just step away?

204
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,434
Away.

205
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,577
Away. Away from there.
Thank you.

206
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:13,212
Hi. Sorry. Okay,
 so you go first.

207
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:16,648
No, you!
 No, you.

208
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,452
Get out.

209
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:22,057
-Get out.
-Excuse me, just a moment.

210
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:24,351
You know what? l have customers,
so go on quick.

211
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:27,725
Yeah.
 Then what?

212
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,388
No, he didn't.

213
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,759
-No, he didn't.
-Can l just ask you one question?

214
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:36,803
You know what, ma'am?
You have to wait. Okay?

215
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,567
What? No,
 a maid.

216
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:42,375
-l don't know.
-Yo.

217
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,673
-You can't be back here.
-Leezette?

218
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,404
What are you doing?

219
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:49,106
Being that we're sisters
in the service business...

220
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:50,411
...
and l'm in a rush...

221
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:53,215
...l'd say you start serving
your low-end customers...

222
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,323
...because that's
the reason you're here.

223
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:58,289
Unless we're not good enough
for you to service.

224
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,889
ln which case,
l'm sure your manager is.

225
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,259
What do you say, ladies?
Am l right or am l right?

226
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,730
-You're right.
-Oh, yes.

227
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:11,268
-Sorry, Mom.
-Baby, where were you?

228
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,566
Keef,
 do me a favor.

229
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:14,506
These go to the goddess
in the Park Suite.

230
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:17,977
-l got you. Don't forget the bags.
-Thank you.

231
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:19,410
Are you ready?

232
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,574
-l'm not gonna have time to change.
-Sure you do. We'll be a little late.

233
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:25,516
No, Ma,
 we cannot be late, okay?

234
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:27,280
-Come on.
-l was on time.

235
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,588
Are they here yet?

236
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,067
-Hello?
-Marisa?

237
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:53,341
Yeah. Marcus.
 Yeah.

238
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:55,074
No,
 l can't hear you.

239
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:58,244
-When's Ty's speech again?
-l'll get it.

240
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,651
ln 20 minutes,
 at 4:00.

241
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:03,383
-And you cannot be late.
-Well....

242
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:05,115
Marcus!

243
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:09,064
-You're just breaking up. What?
-I can't be there. I'm in Miami.

244
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,928
-Please tell me you're kidding.
-I'm in Miami with Mugsy.

245
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:14,332
Don't do this to me,
 Marcus.

246
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:17,564
Don't let him get away with it.
Be strong, Marisa.

247
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,005
What am l supposed
to tell him this time?

248
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,973
-This weekend is the holiday.
-I know.

249
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:24,336
-He's counting on it.
-He'll get over it.

250
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:27,846
-I'll take him at Christmas, okay?
-Tell somebody who believes you.

251
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,043
l gotta go.

252
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,718
That shit.

253
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:37,359
This fell out of your bag.
 ls it yours?

254
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,253
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:44,729
Management,
 huh?

256
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:46,901
Que fancy.

257
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:51,470
What?

258
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,765
l'm not saying a word.

259
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:56,936
Can you not say a word
somewhere else?

260
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:02,381
And our next speaker
will be Ty Ventura.

261
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:29,705
Richard Milhous Nixon...

262
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,644
...was a man
of many contradictions.

263
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,482
Even though
he is remembered in history...

264
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:44,093
...as the only president
to ever resign...

265
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:52,490
...his foreign policies
and his relations with China...

266
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,934
...opened up the Western door
to Eastern--

267
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:01,100
l mean, Eastern door
to Western ties.

268
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:03,142
That's enough.

269
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:07,947
Born a Quaker,
he was nevertheless....

270
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:12,718
He was responsible 
for bombing...

271
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,824
...for the violent 
bombing of....

272
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,823
Richard Nixon was born in.
...

273
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:50,017
Hey, baby.

274
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,864
They were all laughing at me,
and then l lost my words.

275
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,057
You know, it happens
sometimes, honey.

276
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:03,467
l never want to do that again,
 okay?

277
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:08,503
You're going to do 
better next time.

278
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,372
No.

279
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,979
All right,
 we'll talk about it later...

280
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:21,019
...because l got something for you.
The new Nixon tapes.

281
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:27,919
Come on, you know
you wanna open it.

282
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:32,996
Mom.

283
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:36,600
Oh, papi.

284
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:38,206
l'm sorry.

285
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,903
Where's Dad?

286
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:48,480
He had a construction job
in Poughkeepsie.

287
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:51,553
lt was paying time and a half,
and he had to do it, baby.

288
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,319
lt's okay.

289
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,484
So you'll hang out with me
at the hotel this weekend, okay?

290
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:11,269
A married guy was buying
clothes for his girlfriend.

291
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,602
l know. He gave me
his number yesterday.

292
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,767
-What's up, Frannie, Michelle?
-Good morning.

293
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:19,107
-Hey, Ty, how are you?
-What's up, Ty?

294
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:23,508
Lily?

295
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,653
We're here.

296
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:29,882
Hey, are you going to keep me
company today, Ty?

297
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,923
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

298
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:37,362
Now, he's got books and puzzles
and all kinds of fun stuff. Right, baby?

299
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:43,101
-l'm on 22 if you need me, okay?
-Okay.

300
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,940
So l'll see you at lunchtime.

301
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:49,302
You all right?

302
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,508
l'm cool.

303
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:59,276
You know, l am really sorry
about all this.

304
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:03,524
lt's not your fault.

305
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:09,259
-See you later. Thank you.
-Sure.

306
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,826
What's with the face?

307
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:18,303
He's a kid. He has
a whole hotel to play with.

308
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:20,841
-We come here every day.
-He'll have a ball.

309
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,134
You said it.

310
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:26,111
-You need to loosen up.
-l'm not interested.

311
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:27,977
-Why are you stealing my tissues?
-l need them.

312
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,814
While you're there, get me soap,
shower caps, some Kiehl's.

313
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:37,482
We need some fun in our lives.
Be spontaneous, kick up our skirts.

314
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:40,826
-The expression is ''heels.''
-Maybe for you.

315
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:42,965
-l'm with you, girl.
-You only live once.

316
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:45,566
-You know. Come on.
-No.

317
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,235
Live it, girl.

318
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,304
l'm living.

319
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,497
l'm living.

320
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,809
Come on, help me clean the
Park Suite. You're not doing nothing.

321
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,778
Oh, sorry. Aren't you
the maid l had yesterday?

322
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:05,852
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, fantastic. l need another favor.

323
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:07,785
l'm late for lunch,
otherwise l'd do it.

324
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:11,915
Would you run down to the boutique
and return the outfits in the closet?

325
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:14,721
-Sure, l'll take care of it.
-Thank you. You're the best.

326
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:16,421
Okay.

327
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,726
-Who's she?
-She's the goddess.

328
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,735
She's staying in the Park Suite.
You two have a lot in common.

329
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:24,338
Yeah? Then why am l the one
wearing the uniform?

330
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,940
What l meant was
that she also has a boyfriend...

331
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,009
...who she's been with for a while,
who still has not popped--

332
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,807
Her cherry?
Because then we'd be identical.

333
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,918
-What are you looking at?
-l meant the question.

334
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:39,418
My God,
 is your mind always...

335
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,784
...
on the pepperoni?

336
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,188
That's right,
 baby.

337
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,734
All right, here's the difference
between me and the goddess.

338
00:24:57,907 --> 00:25:00,431
She's playing games
to trick him into wanting her--

339
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,340
-And you're what?
-l'm working hard for the money.

340
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:07,381
Speaking of which, you hand
in your application? Management?

341
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,038
Yeah.

342
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:12,948
What are you doing?

343
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:17,451
-Dolce, nice.
-No, no, come on, get out of there.

344
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:20,595
l'm just taking a little peek.
They're going back anyway.

345
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:22,390
You're gonna get us in trouble.

346
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,824
Hello, ladies.

347
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,764
Leave that stuff alone.
 Come on.

348
00:25:26,936 --> 00:25:28,995
You're supposed to be
helping me out in here.

349
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,434
Feel this material.

350
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:34,543
l mean,
 it's like butter.

351
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:38,939
Oh, my God.

352
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:42,048
This stuff is $5000.

353
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:45,846
For one white outfit?
How do you keep it clean?

354
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,181
Scotchgard.

355
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:49,290
Oh, yeah.
They're a 6, you're a 6.

356
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,653
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

357
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:53,817
And shoes too.

358
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:56,328
Shoes. Size 9.
 Perfect.

359
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,160
-l'm a 7 1 l2.
-Which means you're an 8.

360
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:01,325
Just put on some gym socks,
you're good to go.

361
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:04,605
That's it. Put this stuff back.
What are you doing?

362
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:06,139
Not until you try it on.

363
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:08,298
l can't try on her clothes!

364
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,940
They're not hers. They're not Dolce's.
Technically, they've been abandoned.

365
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,105
Let's not let them hear us.

366
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:16,274
Who,
 the clothes?

367
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,919
Marisa Ave Maria Ventura...

368
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:22,182
...when will you or l ever get
to try on a $5000 anything?

369
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:28,160
Come on, feel how
the other half feels, huh?

370
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:32,630
Hey, Lily,
 what are you doing?

371
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:36,533
Hey.
 l'm sewing on a button.

372
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:39,104
What's the cook 
making for lunch?

373
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:42,971
Saturday, you'll have
mac and cheese.

374
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,546
Where you going?

375
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,778
Around.
 l'll be right back.

376
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:56,255
-Stay close, okay?
-Okay.

377
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:57,783
Rufus.

378
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,394
Rufus, come here.
Come here. Sit.

379
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:01,893
-Where are you going?
-For a walk.

380
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:04,624
No, there's a League of Women Voters
lunch downstairs.

381
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,860
-We should do a drive-by.
-A quick pit stop?

382
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:08,525
Yeah, in and out.
Leave them laughing.

383
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,229
-Hey, Jer, quick question. Be honest.
-Sure thing.

384
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,341
Do l look as stupid
as you think l am?

385
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,205
No. l mean, you're not stupid.
What are you talking about?

386
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:18,107
-Come on.
-Where are you going? No.

387
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,248
You have a problem
with the ladies' lunch?

388
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:22,940
l have a problem trying to upstage
Victor Delgado. Remember him?

389
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,144
The guy running against me for Senate,
scheduled to speak downstairs?

390
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,881
He's not speaking until 1 :30.

391
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:39,362
l know this offends your sense
of fairness, but l'd like to win.

392
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,525
-You don't give up.
-No, of course not.

393
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,729
That's why you hired me.
Look, you go to the luncheon, okay?

394
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:48,364
You go to Maddox's thing on Monday.
''Hello,'' ''goodbye,'' you're home free.

395
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,738
Define ''free.''

396
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:56,150
Look, they have people who will
walk your dog for you.

397
00:27:56,317 --> 00:27:59,219
-l mean, l know that's a crazy idea.
-l want to walk my own dog.

398
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,380
Relax. You're starting
to lose your hair.

399
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:05,084
He's friendly.

400
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,785
-His name is Rufus.
-Hey, Rufus.

401
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:10,159
So,
 what are you listening to?

402
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,633
-The Best of Bread.
-Best of Bread? lnteresting.

403
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:18,633
What's your name?

404
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,671
-Ty.
-Nice to meet you, Ty. l'm Chris.

405
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:24,745

407
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:28,949
Yeah?

00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:32,177
l know that you're
the state assemblyman.

409
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:34,720
l know you're thinking
of running for senator.

00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,257

your stand on environmental causes.

411
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:39,989

412
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:43,290
-Look, l hate to interrupt, but--
-Are you Republican?

413
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,092
Yes.

414
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:47,429
Why?

415
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,400
Richard Nixon was Republican.

416
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:50,833
So what?

417
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:52,804
-He lied.
-So, what does that mean?

418
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:54,498
Nothing.

419
00:28:55,343 --> 00:28:57,208
Who told you to ask
these questions?

420
00:28:57,646 --> 00:28:58,773
Nobody.

421
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,673
What press are you 
affiliated with?

422
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:03,208
l'm 1 0.

423
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,114
Your parents?

424
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,813
-What's the difference these days?
-l love this kid.

425
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:09,890
Well,

426
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,489
-Where you going?
-l'm gonna walk Rufus.

427
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:16,359

00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:18,466

You're in a hurry.

432
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,641
-He doesn't have time.
-No, he's in a hurry. l'm fine.

433
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:31,006
-You take him.
-What?

434
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:33,205
l'll go up with you.

435
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,679
l don't want to-- Wait!

436
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:41,480

00:29:59,074 --> 00:30:02,373
Hey, Ma, this is Chris. He's got
a giant gray dog named Rufus.

443
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:06,275
And if you say okay,

444
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,417
-Hello.

449
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:21,692
-What?
-The weather can be so tricky here.

450
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,764
Weren't you saying

451
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,565
Oh,
 you're going out?

452
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:28,634
Weren't you saying how you
wanted to stretch your legs?

453
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:31,102
Well, if your husband
wouldn't mind....

454
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:33,537
She doesn't have a husband.

455
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:36,133
-l don't have a husband.
-l insist, then.

456
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,142

-Put these on.
-The shoes are too big.

-Come on, Ty, let's go find Rufus.
-Come on, Mom.

-So be cool, okay?
-Okay.

465
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:02,237

lf that slips out again,
tuck it in for me.

467
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:07,131
And the night before.
You're not answering your pager.

-Really? l never got the message.
-Really?

469
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,875
You said you'd 
take us to Niketown.

Well, here,

00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:39,668
Bye-Bye.

474
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:41,468

-Pee! Lift your leg.
-Jerry Siegel, is that you?

477
00:31:52,554 --> 00:31:54,488
Hey, Maddox, how are you?
Small world.

Kill! Kill!
 Rufus! Kill!

00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:35,124
-She got a name?
-Yeah, ''Unidentified Old Friend.''

491

-You got it.
-Open bar?

495
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:46,701
-Don't push it.
-Thank you.

496
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,701
Come on, Rufus.

497
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:51,846
Did you have fun
with mean, old Jerry?

498
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,038
A great time!
lt was perfect timing.

499
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:57,947
Both Delgado and Maddox
saw me walking your goddamn dog.

500
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,088
See, you should get out more.
Come on, Rufus.

501
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:03,747
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there at 1 :30.

502
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:07,157
l want you there at 1 :00, okay?
All right? Okay?

503
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,628
Bye.
 l'm going to shower.

504
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,700
l just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

505
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,669
l just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

506
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:15,961
-Wait up!
-Don't say anything. Just act--

507
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,138
l couldn't do it.
All those photographers all the time.

508
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,744
You don't know what you can do
until you have to.

509
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:26,778
There's not a lot of choice.
You get used to it.

510
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,051
-Can l take him?
-Sure. Go ahead.

511
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,947
-Be careful. He's strong.
-Come on.

512
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,679
-Be careful and stay close.
-l will.

513
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,718
Hang on!

514
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:43,855
Thanks for this.
He's been a little down lately.

515
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:47,559
Then yesterday, he gave a speech
at school, and he messed it up.

516
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:48,828
lt was bad.

517
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:52,496
Speeches can be tricky.
What happened?

518
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:55,165
l don't know.
He just froze and ran off-stage.

519
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:58,835
Now he has this thing about speaking
in public. He's all freaked out.

520
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:01,949
l always get nervous
before l go on.

521
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:05,321
-Really?
-Yeah.

522
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:09,485
Well, not always.
Just sometimes.

523
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:11,753
-Mr. Marshall?
-Look at the dogs.

524
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:15,488
What a surprise, a dog walker.
Let me guess. Jerry sent you.

525
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:17,631
Yeah,
 to get Rufus.

526
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,233
-ls that Rufus?
-That's him.

527
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,800
He's beautiful.

528
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,664
-Can l?
-Sure.

529
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:24,271
-Hey, buddy!
-Can l have him?

530
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,499
-Okay.
-Thank you.

531
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:29,242
-Ma, can l go play?
-Yeah, go ahead.

532
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,407
This is for you.

533
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:34,847
-Thank you.
-Bye. Let's go.

534
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:39,251
lt's from my nanny.

535
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,251
Do you want to sit down?

536
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:44,320
-Sure.
-Over here.

537
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:53,157
Cool,
 l won't get dirty.

538
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:57,602
Oh, Lord! l almost sat on your face.
Right there.

539
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,981
Ty seems like a terrific kid.

540
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:16,289
Thanks. l'm kind of crazy
about him.

541
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:21,021
l've never met a 1 0-year-old
Nixon aficionado.

542
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:25,394
Yeah, l know. Last year,
they studied the '70s at school...

543
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,434
...and he's become obsessed
with the politics, the music.

544
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:30,628
He was reading
the Kissinger biography.

545
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:32,535
-You're kidding!
-No.

546
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:36,974
l'm waiting for him to discover another
decade. Until then, l'm learning a lot.

547
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:40,238
Well,
 l think it's great.

548
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:43,343
-You do?
-l do.

549
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:48,180
Guess what? l threw a stick
in the air, and Rufus caught it!

550
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,724
-Really?
-Yeah. l'm gonna go do it again.

551
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:56,131
So how long are you
in town for?

552
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,791
l'm not sure.

553
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:01,731
You always stay 
at the Beresford?

554
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:06,931
Sometimes l feel 
like l live there.

555
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,602
So,
 what brings you here?

556
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:13,672
-Work.
-What do you do?

557
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:19,653
-Oh, my God! 1 1 :00, by the tree.
-What?

558
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:21,814
Check it,
 1 1 :00.

559
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,655
That's Eddie Yatter.

560
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:26,852
-What does he want?
-He's paparazzi. l can't shake him.

561
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:29,430
He works for Blanton Maddox...

562
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:32,532
...whose goal lately is
to catch me with another woman...

563
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:37,535
...so his sleazy tabloid can say
that l've broken up with--

564
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:40,197
Your supermodel fiancÃ©e?

565
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:41,934
Oh, God! Ty!

566
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,238
-What?
-Come on!

567
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,981
-l just realized that you--
-Excuse me?

568
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,642
-Sorry, it's just that my face is--
-What?

569
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:53,413
-What's wrong with your face?
-lt's stuck to your--

570
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,113
What's that?

571
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:59,990
-Oh, God. Oh, God! Get it off.
-Here, let me. lt's okay.

572
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:03,494
Oh, my God! Did l get
anything on it? ls it okay?

573
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,360
lt's perfect.

574
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:09,702
-So....
-Okay.

575
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:12,171
Don't believe 
everything you read.

576
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,173
-Any of it true?
-No.

577
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:20,247
Well, we were seeing each other.
Now we're seeing less of each other.

578
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,543
lt's complicated.

579
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:26,250
l want to show you something.
Follow me.

580
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,889
Oh, God.

581
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:38,590
-Let me help you.
-l got it. lt's fine. l'm good.

582
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:41,769
Don't worry about me.

583
00:37:41,936 --> 00:37:43,997
Look at that.

584
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:49,576
lt's like two different worlds.

585
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:53,072
-lnteresting perspective, huh?
-Yeah.

586
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:56,115
And l'd like to point out
it's paparazzi-free.

587
00:37:57,552 --> 00:38:01,079
You know when l come here most
is when l have to make a speech...

588
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:02,586
...
and l get nervous.

589
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,122
-You get nervous?
-Sure.

590
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:05,282
See that?

591
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,521
Sometimes when l have
to stand up in front of people...

592
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:12,599
...my heart kind of races,
and l can't remember my words.

593
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:16,227
-Same here. l know.
-Really? Same with you?

594
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:19,602
Wow. Well, in my business,
it's not a good thing.

595
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:22,637
-What do you do?
-What do l do?

596
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:25,041
l want to show you something.

597
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:29,809
l hold on to this.

598
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:32,780
A paper clip?
Was that a paper clip?

599
00:38:32,954 --> 00:38:34,684
lt was.
l had to find something...

600
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:37,347
...to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart.

601
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,221
Like a....

602
00:38:39,394 --> 00:38:42,593
-Like a lightning rod?
-Like a lightning rod. Exactly.

603
00:38:42,764 --> 00:38:44,789
All the energy
goes into the paper clip.

604
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:47,059
And then what's left is.
...

605
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:48,735
Your speech.

606
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:51,771
Yeah, a smooth,
and l'd like to think...

607
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:54,568
...
very compelling speech.

608
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:58,403
Some of the best speakers
in history...

609
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,479
...
a paper clip.

610
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:04,213
Let me see,
 Henry Kissinger.

611
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:06,881
He wasn't known
for his speaking abilities.

612
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,523
No, he wasn't,
 was he?

613
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:15,227
Well, imagine what he would've
been like without the:

614
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:19,097
-He would've really sucked.
-He would've what?

615
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:20,930
-Really sucked.
-Right.

616
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:24,867
So maybe you'll try again?

617
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:29,710
Hey, Ma,
can we go see the penguins?

618
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:35,046
-Let's go see penguins.
-Five minutes.

619
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:39,617
-You're a bad influence.
-l am?

620
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:41,278
Hurry up!

621
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,461
Look at this guy go.

622
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,697
They're so funny.

623
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,360
They look like little, fat,
short guys with tuxedos.

624
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,872
Speaking of fat guys in tuxedos,
there's this thing Monday night.

625
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:05,605
lt's a black-tie.
lt's a $2500-a-plate dinner.

626
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,910
-Oh, my God. $2500 per plate?
-$2500 a plate.

627
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:13,521
-l hope you get to keep the plate.
-You can if you want.

628
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:15,514
What is it for?

629
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:18,818
For the inner-city literacy campaign,
something l support.

630
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:22,019
lt's a big benefit that Maddox
throws every year.

631
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:26,530
lt's not quite as boring as it sounds.
l don't know, are you interested?

632
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:31,867
Wait a minute. lsn't that the guy who
hired Yatter to get pictures of you?

633
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:33,439
Yes, it is.

634
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:35,704
l don't get it.
Why would you go?

635
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:40,372
l go because-- l go--
lt's exposure.

636
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:43,916
Won't everyone know you're there
just to expose yourself?

637
00:40:44,086 --> 00:40:47,213
Well, l kind of
have to expose myself.

638
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:50,552
-When you put it that way--
-l didn't. You put it that way.

639
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,320
l don't care how much
you pay for dinner.

640
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,692
You shouldn't serve yourself up,
no matter what the cause.

641
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:59,459
So why don't you tell me
what you really think.

642
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:02,195
You really want me
to tell you what l think?

643
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:07,035
lf Mr. Wanton Maddox, or whatever
his name is, really wants to help...

644
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:10,701
...why doesn't he give the $2500
per plate to the inner-city schools?

645
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:13,814
And eat a little bit lighter that night,
you know?

646
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:17,840
So why don't you come with me
and tell him yourself.

647
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:20,514
Monday...

648
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,747
...l'm busy.
 Sorry.

649
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:27,461
You're busy, you can't?
What? Can you change it?

650
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:29,721
lt's complicated.

651
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,329
Which reminds me, l gotta get
out of here. Come on, we gotta go.

652
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:37,961
-We gotta go. We're gonna be late.
-Do we have to?

653
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:42,276
-l gotta get back.
-Caroline.

654
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:46,644
This can't be it. Come on,
we haven't seen the snakes.

655
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:48,840
Except for Yatter.

656
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:53,884
lt was nice meeting you,
Chris Marshall.

657
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,887
We're late. We gotta go.
Come on.

658
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:03,827
Here, Ty....

659
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,894
-Don't use them all on one speech.
-l won't.

660
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:12,532
-Keep up the good voting record.
-l'll do my best.

661
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,681
''lt's complicated.''
What kind of answer is that?

662
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:22,146
Honest.

663
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:25,980
The only thing complicated between
me and him would be my bra strap.

664
00:42:26,153 --> 00:42:29,921
Look, what am l supposed to do?
Make his bed with me in it?

665
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:31,184
Get real!

666
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,329
-He thinks l'm a guest here.
-All right. All right.

667
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:36,988
But just tell me 
what he was like.

668
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:40,327
Sexy eyes.

669
00:42:40,568 --> 00:42:42,503
And nice lips.

670
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:45,663
What about the hands?
Were they big?

671
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:54,642
-They were perfect.
-Perfect works.

672
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:56,579
-Marisa!
-Who? What?

673
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:00,189
-Marisa Ventura, are you back there?
-Oh, my God, it's Paula!

674
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,730
What are you doing?

675
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:16,631
l just....
l spilled something on my apron...

676
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,001
...so l was cleaning it,
and she was helping me tie it.

677
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:22,836
Mr. Bextrum wants to see you
in his office right now.

678
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:31,309
Oh, shit!

679
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:38,282
Look who's here.
Let's review the last hour, okay?

680
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,293
Delgado killed while you were
out walking that goddamn dog.

681
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,593
-You got a pen that works?
-Sure. Here you go.

682
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:48,735
-Anything else l can do for you?
-No, that's good, thanks.

683
00:43:48,903 --> 00:43:51,372
Get this note to the woman
in the Park Suite.

684
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:54,134
Her name is Caroline.

685
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:56,300
-Can you handle that for me?
-Certainly.

686
00:43:56,477 --> 00:43:59,413
-Thank you.
-Who's Caroline in the Park Suite?

687
00:43:59,581 --> 00:44:02,072
Someone l met.
You wanted me to have an escort...

688
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,548
...for that Maddox literacy thing
on Monday night.

689
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,816
But l was thinking more of a blind,
ex-illiterate senior citizen who learned...

690
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,483
-...to read while fighting Nazis.
-l thought your mother was in Florida.

691
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,097
Just make sure she's not married,
on medication...

692
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:18,289
...or a Democrat.
Did you check, or--?

693
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:19,456
Rufus.

694
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:22,865
Sure, okay, great.
Can l talk to you for a second?

695
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,405
l want you to find out who
Caroline is in the Park Suite.

696
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:28,769
Don't write it down.
Just remember it.

697
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:30,343
Thanks.
 Good job.

698
00:44:40,355 --> 00:44:42,619
Come in,
 Miss Ventura.

699
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:49,289
l assume you know the reason
you've been called here.

700
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,693
l think so.
 Yes, sir.

701
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:56,932
Do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is?

702
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:01,606
Location?

703
00:45:01,943 --> 00:45:05,139
Loyalty and trust.

704
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:08,872
Would you say those are qualities
that you possess?

705
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,575
l would.
 Yes, sir.

706
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:15,584
Miss Burns agrees.

707
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,884
And she's urged me
to consider you.

708
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,885
We had no idea you were
interested in management...

709
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:24,055
...until Miss Kehoe brought us
your application.

710
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,463
By the way, you forgot
your social security number...

711
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:31,037
...and your 
mother's maiden name.

712
00:45:31,206 --> 00:45:35,575
lf you just fill them in
and sign right there. Perfect.

713
00:45:35,744 --> 00:45:39,977
Normally, you'd go through the program
and train for a year as a butler, but--

714
00:45:40,148 --> 00:45:43,584
-Given the circumstances--
-Due to overbooking and understaffing...

715
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:46,017
...we decided to accelerate
your application.

716
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:49,385
And move you into management
after the six-week training.

717
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:51,959
With the proviso that you
pass the practical exam...

718
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:54,925
...and fulfill each requirement
for every station.

719
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:57,860
So you see, Miss Ventura,
sometimes...

720
00:45:58,032 --> 00:46:02,595
...when life shuts one door,
it opens a window.

721
00:46:03,506 --> 00:46:05,200
So jump.

722
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:11,845
Steph, where are you?
l know you're in here.

723
00:46:12,881 --> 00:46:16,113
-Don't tell me you're busted.
-No, you are.

724
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:18,843
You know what?
You had no right!

725
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:20,385
What are you talking about?

726
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,713
You filled out
an application for me?

727
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:26,689
-They're considering you.
-Do you know what you've done?

728
00:46:26,863 --> 00:46:29,729
-l did you a favor.
-No. lf you wanna do me a favor...

729
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:32,331
...then mind your own business
once in a while.

730
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:35,767
For two years, you've yapped
about getting out of uniform...

731
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:37,461
...
and what ideas you got.

732
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:41,075
This morning, l'm having coffee
with Rosalie from personnel...

733
00:46:41,242 --> 00:46:43,608
...and l ask her.
l go, ''Marisa got a shot?''

734
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:46,680
She goes, ''Marisa who?''
l go, ''Marisa Ventura. She's applied.''

735
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:50,010
She goes, ''lf she applied,
l'd slip it to the top of the pile.''

736
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:53,643
So l just act real nonchalantlike
and l go, ''Are you sure?''

737
00:46:53,822 --> 00:46:56,483
So she goes, she double-checks,
and she tells me:

738
00:46:56,657 --> 00:47:01,186
''Marisa Ventura ain't never applied
for no management program ever.''

739
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:04,264
lmagine my shock and dismay.

740
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:06,297
My own partner,
lying to me like that.

741
00:47:06,468 --> 00:47:10,164
Then l figured maybe you were
too chickenshit, so l did it myself.

742
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:11,930
lf they took you,
you'd be happy.

743
00:47:12,106 --> 00:47:15,508
And if they didn't, you wouldn't know
the difference. So sue me!

744
00:47:15,677 --> 00:47:18,702
These are the golden years.
We gotta prove our mothers wrong.

745
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,872
Don't waste them.

746
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:38,026
What we did today was wrong.

747
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,102
But you didn't really lie.
Not technically.

748
00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:43,238
Now you're starting
to sound like Nixon.

749
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:45,430
Letting someone believe
something's true when it's not...

750
00:47:45,606 --> 00:47:47,403
...is just as much
a lie as a lie is.

751
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:51,307
l let him think l was staying in the
suite, not cleaning it. l'm the maid.

752
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:55,347
l hate to break it to you,
but l don't think he's after your money.

753
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:58,713
l can't believe 
you just said that!

754
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,314
Just get my keys in my pocket,
please. This is hot.

755
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,541
Good job.

756
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:33,918
All right, sweetie.
Behave yourself, okay?

757
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:36,856
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

758
00:48:40,695 --> 00:48:42,059
Can l borrow this?

759
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,992
-Of course.
-Thank you.

760
00:48:44,164 --> 00:48:45,722
Baby, bye.

761
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,834
And remember,
all security lDs...

762
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:50,700
...will need to be rephotographed
starting next week.

763
00:48:50,872 --> 00:48:53,306
l think that's all.
Thank you very much.

764
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:56,410
Barbara, Clarice,
come with me, please.

765
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:06,048
-Have you seen this?
-No. What?

766
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:08,018
Well,
 let me show you.

767
00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:09,747
Give me this.

768
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,952
Yeah. So?

769
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:16,619
What do you mean, ''so''? What if
somebody from the hotel sees it?

770
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:19,561
l hate to break the bubble.
You can't tell it's you.

771
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:22,896
-Don't worry about it.
-lt's the front page of the paper today.

772
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:26,905
Stop. You do one spontaneous thing,
you think you're going to hell.

773
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:29,134
Do you understand
this could be bad?

774
00:49:29,311 --> 00:49:32,439
Don't be such a Catholic. Please.
Come on.

775
00:49:38,253 --> 00:49:40,017
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

776
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:42,280
-Can l steal him away for a second?
-Sure.

777
00:49:42,456 --> 00:49:45,289
-Let me steal you away.
-Excuse me.

778
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:48,259
-l want to talk to you.
-What's the problem?

779
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:51,322
This! Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

780
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:54,662
An entire day of doing nothing
but covering your ass.

781
00:49:54,836 --> 00:49:57,896
l'm getting calls from The London
Times, The Washington Post...

782
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:01,269
...the Chicago Sun, asking
about her identity, her background...

783
00:50:01,443 --> 00:50:04,240
...who the kid is.
 A kid!

784
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:09,442
Just when l get them to focus on your
assets, they're focusing on hers.

785
00:50:09,617 --> 00:50:10,811
Thanks.

786
00:50:10,985 --> 00:50:14,921
Yeah, well, they're fantastic assets,
don't you think?

787
00:50:21,195 --> 00:50:27,135
Squeezing the circle
tighter and tighter and tighter...

788
00:50:27,302 --> 00:50:30,499
...and release.
Let's try that again.

789
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:35,131
And squeeze the circle
tighter, tighter...

790
00:50:35,309 --> 00:50:38,972
-...and relax.
-Sorry, l'll come back.

791
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:42,173
That's okay.
You can work around us.

792
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:45,547
We could use some more towels,
por favor. Rapido.

793
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,916
Squeezing the circle tighter...

794
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,990
...
and tighter and tighter.

795
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,389
Radiating from the pelvis.

796
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,622
Good. Breathe.

797
00:50:57,798 --> 00:50:59,596
Exhale.

798
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,394
Are you all right?

799
00:51:02,202 --> 00:51:06,037
Twinkles, is it Eric?
l knew it.

800
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:10,702
He hasn't called once.

801
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:13,608
Not my cell, not the service,
not the hotel.

802
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:19,579
So last night l called him, and--
Rach, he was with....

803
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:22,916
l can't.
 lt's like cheap wine.

804
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,356
-Shall we do some band work, ladies?
-Go on, l'm listening.

805
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:29,291
-l heard her in the background.
-The cheap wine?

806
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:32,922
His ex,
 in midlaugh.

807
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:34,499
Butler service,
 Miss Lane.

808
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:39,001
l have a message
from Mr. Christopher Marshall.

809
00:51:39,173 --> 00:51:41,335
Christopher Marshall?

810
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:43,943
As in,
 Christopher Marshall?

811
00:51:45,113 --> 00:51:48,173
He's staying in the York Suite
and was wondering...

812
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:50,681
...if you had a response
to the luncheon invitation...

813
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:53,343
...l placed in 
your room yesterday.

814
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:56,251
-We're through. Thank you.
-ln my room?

815
00:51:56,423 --> 00:51:58,619
-l have to charge the full hour.
-Yesterday.

816
00:51:58,793 --> 00:51:59,885
-Fine.
-For lunch?

817
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:01,550
-For two.
-Get out!

818
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:03,526
-Where?
-ln his suite.

819
00:52:04,365 --> 00:52:06,230
This is a miracle.

820
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:11,201
-Shall l give him an answer?
-Yes. Tell him yes. What time?

821
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:14,000
-1 p.m.
-She'll be there. Thank you.

822
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:15,733
When did this go down?

823
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,003
We met at this thing
in Southampton last summer.

824
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,943
l thought we had a moment.

825
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:24,175
''Can you steal away an hour,
please?''

826
00:52:24,352 --> 00:52:28,550
-You think he saw you in the hall?
-Who cares? What should l wear?

827
00:52:28,722 --> 00:52:30,747
You look good in anything.

828
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:33,018
But l didn't bring a thing!

829
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,422
Let's see.

830
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:41,532
Maria, thank goodness.
l need a favor. lt's urgent.

831
00:52:41,702 --> 00:52:45,035
Could you get those outfits
you returned for me yesterday?

832
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:48,039
There's this divine
Dolce cashmere coat. lt's just--

833
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:52,702
Actually, they're still in the closet.
l thought you might want a second look.

834
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,307
You are so good.
Thank God!

835
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:59,852
-You should be a personal assistant.
-She's a maid.

836
00:53:00,021 --> 00:53:04,959
-So are they, with better titles.
-Actually, l'm up for a position.

837
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:06,889
What do you think?

838
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:09,421
Dolce coat,
 Gucci pants...

839
00:53:09,597 --> 00:53:12,463
...or Ralph Lauren skirt,
Manolo pumps?

840
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:14,829
They're both divine!
Let's see.

841
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:17,800
How about the pants, open sandals,
see-through blouse...

842
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,566
...colored bra and carry
the Dolce coat for effect.

843
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,538
-Maria?
-She barely speaks English.

844
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:28,642
-What?
-Excuse me?

845
00:53:28,816 --> 00:53:31,718
Maria,
 what do you think?

846
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:34,814
What about the beaded skirt
with that beige...

847
00:53:34,989 --> 00:53:37,355
...crocheted halter
you have in the closet?

848
00:53:37,526 --> 00:53:39,892
You know, casual sexy.
No stockings.

849
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:42,655
Definitely eighty-six the coat.
lt sends the wrong message.

850
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:44,456
Like you're going someplace.

851
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:48,590
Besides, that whole see-through
blouse, colored-bra thing...

852
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:53,867
...reads a little desperate, older gal,
trying too hard. Don't you think?

853
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:58,043
You want to make 
him work for it.

854
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:01,143
Who does she think she is
to talk to me like that?

855
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:03,010
Thank you,
 Maria.

856
00:54:03,184 --> 00:54:07,347
l have two words for you,
Rachel Hoffberg: Eric who?

857
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,584
Excuse me.
 Sorry.

858
00:54:13,994 --> 00:54:15,758
Yes, that's it.

859
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,593
All handles parallel
with the right elbow.

860
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:27,403
Review your protocols
for table setting and wine service.

861
00:54:27,575 --> 00:54:30,806
We're serving lunch
at the York Suite today.

862
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:45,423
Butler service,
 Mr. Marshall.

863
00:54:45,593 --> 00:54:46,889
Come on in.

864
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:49,858
Rufus, it's okay.
Thank you.

865
00:55:27,635 --> 00:55:30,865
Water glasses 3 inches east
of the wine goblets.

866
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,666
-Make a perfect triangle.
-Yes, sir.

867
00:55:44,485 --> 00:55:46,477
Hold on,
 l'm coming.

868
00:55:50,692 --> 00:55:54,287
You're an animal lover too!
So am l.

869
00:55:55,028 --> 00:55:58,122
l just can't get enough of them.

870
00:55:59,434 --> 00:56:03,164
What a wonderful idea.
Lunch Ã  deux. Lovely!

871
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:08,298
l just knew that we made
a connection at the...

872
00:56:08,477 --> 00:56:10,943
...
Feathered Friends Tournament.

873
00:56:13,881 --> 00:56:15,905
Look!

874
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:20,814
How sweet of you to remember.

875
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:25,856
But l hope you didn't think
l needed reminding.

876
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:31,163
Teddy Parrish 
sends you his best.

877
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:32,459
Oh, Teddy.

878
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,860
Right. Yeah.

879
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,559
How is Teddy?

880
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:39,401
Drinking again,
but you didn't hear it from me.

881
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:41,508
Excuse me,
l gotta check on something.

882
00:56:41,675 --> 00:56:43,405
Of course.

883
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:50,206
Who is that over there?

884
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:52,785
Caroline Lane.

885
00:56:54,222 --> 00:56:56,782
No. No,
 it's not her.

886
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:58,481
-lt's not her?
-No.

887
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:02,057
The Maddox thing.

888
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:06,030
-Are you going?
-Of course.

889
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:09,798
You know who l can't figure out
where l know them from?

890
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:11,939
The woman visiting you
the other day...

891
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:16,041
...kind of Mediterranean,
with a little boy about 1 0.

892
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,838
Rachel Hoffberg, Mediterranean?
She's from Westport.

893
00:57:20,181 --> 00:57:24,514
She's premenopausal,
but don't tell her l said so.

894
00:57:25,452 --> 00:57:28,651
You're staying in the Park Suite,
right, Caroline?

895
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:31,814
Yes. Yes, l am.

896
00:57:33,027 --> 00:57:34,325
Good.

897
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:37,727
Well,
 it's the damnedest thing.

898
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,434
This salmon is perfect.

899
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:56,046
Your whole presentation today
has been excellent. Well done.

900
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:57,776
Thank you.

901
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:00,385
Make sure you 
tuck it in tightly.

902
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:04,414
She's about 5'6'', dark hair,
really beautiful, has a kid named Ty.

903
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:06,389
What the hell happened?

904
00:58:06,561 --> 00:58:09,791
-l'm sorry, sir.
-Don't be sorry. Just find her.

905
00:58:09,963 --> 00:58:12,523
Chris, l loved your quote
in The Times.

906
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,530
Please!

907
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:29,910
We're all here to try to land
the Rothford Estate. lt's worth zillions.

908
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:33,845
And Sotheby's are counting on me
to lock the whole thing up.

909
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:36,215
-Thank you so much.
-Really?

910
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:38,325
Rufus,
 come here.

911
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:39,822
Thank you.

912
00:58:40,027 --> 00:58:41,221
Sit. Sit.

913
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:44,852
Maria, could l have a little water,
please?

914
00:58:45,432 --> 00:58:48,128
-Good boy.
-Such a sweet dog.

915
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:49,291
Allow me.

916
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:52,764
-That will be all.
-You know Nettie Rothford.

917
00:58:52,939 --> 00:58:54,202
Sure.

918
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,273
She and l virtually 
grew up together.

919
00:58:56,443 --> 00:59:00,006
Her place was bang
next to Daddy's on the Vineyard.

920
00:59:05,452 --> 00:59:07,443
-Right there.
-Good evening.

921
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:09,988
Another interesting day now,
huh, Marisa?

922
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:13,615
-l don't know. Was it?
-You tell me.

923
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:15,421
Nice lunch?

924
00:59:16,564 --> 00:59:18,759
All right, what's up,
 mystery man?

925
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,731
How many times you watched
the monitors with me?

926
00:59:21,903 --> 00:59:25,634
How many times we enjoyed
the comings and goings?

927
00:59:25,806 --> 00:59:26,796
Thousands.

928
00:59:26,974 --> 00:59:30,876
You know what?
You over there, nosy body.

929
00:59:31,046 --> 00:59:34,606
You know l'm beholden
to report employees misbehaving.

930
00:59:35,983 --> 00:59:41,148
And there's only one thing
could make me shut my mouth.

931
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:49,689
You dirty old man.

932
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:55,197
You're in trouble.
What are you laughing at?

933
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:58,834
About the silver soap dishes.
...

934
00:59:59,006 --> 01:00:00,836
Rach, darling,
 l'll just be a sec.

935
01:00:01,008 --> 01:00:04,135
-Hi, l'm Caroline Lane--
-ln the Park Suite, yes.

936
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:07,577
-l called about a ticket to the--
-Benefit. Monday night.

937
01:00:07,747 --> 01:00:12,343
We were able to procure you a single
at a table adjacent to Mr. Marshall's.

938
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:15,079
Fantastic!
 And how much will that be?

939
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:17,416
-Three thousand dollars.
-What?

940
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,115
The rates are raised
when a couple is split.

941
01:00:20,293 --> 01:00:22,318
Singles are always 
harder to place.

942
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:26,660
Well, l mean what is it?
ls it on the lnternet l'm an ex-couple?

943
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:29,358
l mean,
 does the whole hotel know?

944
01:00:29,537 --> 01:00:33,735
ls there a Biblical sign on my forehead?
''Unmarried, unclean''?

945
01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:37,934
Do l bear the scarlet letter?
 l'm....

946
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:39,102
l'm....

947
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,215
l'm just....
Sorry. l....

948
01:00:42,383 --> 01:00:44,282
l'm better now.

949
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:46,852
Just charge it to my room.

950
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:48,318
Yes, ma'am.

951
01:00:48,489 --> 01:00:51,423
Come on, Rach.
 Ghastly man!

952
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:54,059
l am terrified to ask
what that was about.

953
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:56,459
l think,
 being dumped.

954
01:00:56,631 --> 01:00:59,758
-Can l get your autograph?
-Amber? ls that your name?

955
01:00:59,934 --> 01:01:02,128
-Amber's your name.
-How you doing?

956
01:01:02,302 --> 01:01:06,204
Get in the car!
 Get in the car!

957
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:10,977
-Did she see us?
-Yeah. No. You're fine. All's clear.

958
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:13,171
-lt's fine.
-How did this happen?

959
01:01:13,347 --> 01:01:15,508
l think she's very attractive.

960
01:01:15,682 --> 01:01:18,777
l had her checked out.
She comes from a family with money...

961
01:01:18,952 --> 01:01:21,421
...politically neutral and
has no naked pictures.

962
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:23,682
That woman wasn't
the woman l wanted.

963
01:01:23,858 --> 01:01:26,884
l don't know what to say.
l talked to the hotel manager.

964
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:30,724
That's the only Caroline Lane
staying in the Park Suite.

965
01:01:30,898 --> 01:01:33,230
Wait.
 There she is.

966
01:01:33,634 --> 01:01:35,568
That's her.
 Cordell, pull over.

967
01:01:39,974 --> 01:01:43,000
-Hey, wait! Ty! Caroline!
-Hey, Chris!

968
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:45,702
-Hey. How's it going, Ty?
-Okay.

969
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:47,211
-How you doing?
-Good.

970
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:51,374
You want to hear something strange?
l invited you to lunch, and you came...

971
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:52,780
...
only it wasn't you.

972
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,345
So,
 what happened?

973
01:01:55,523 --> 01:02:00,085
-l don't know what you mean.
-Are you still staying at the Beresford?

974
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,253
No, we actually moved uptown.
You know, uptown.

975
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:07,162
Hop in. We're going
to the Tremont Housing Projects.

976
01:02:07,334 --> 01:02:10,360
-We can drop you at the Upper East?
-Yeah, Mom!

977
01:02:10,538 --> 01:02:15,032
No. Remember, we're going to a party
just a few blocks away, so we'll walk.

978
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,802
-So how do l get ahold of you?
-Her cell's 9-1 -7--

979
01:02:18,479 --> 01:02:20,139
How about l call you?

980
01:02:20,314 --> 01:02:23,477
lf you want to get in touch with him,
call this number.

981
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:26,450
That's my card.
What's your last name, hon?

982
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:29,110
-Ventura. What's yours?
-Spanish?

983
01:02:29,289 --> 01:02:32,622
-Jerry Spanish?
-No, Siegel. We have to go.

984
01:02:32,793 --> 01:02:35,318
-So do we.
-Use that number. Call anytime.

985
01:02:35,497 --> 01:02:36,860
-All right.
-Don't be shy.

986
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:41,126
-You're late. You have to give a speech.
-ln the Bronx?

987
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:43,360
-On what?
-Housing projects.

988
01:02:43,537 --> 01:02:44,526
Really?

989
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:48,331
You're telling people
in the Bronx about the projects?

990
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:50,773
No, l'm just gonna
take the press up there...

991
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:53,242
...and shine light
on the living conditions.

992
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:57,113
-lnteresting.
-Yeah, we think so. Shall we? Okay?

993
01:02:57,285 --> 01:02:59,148
-Bye.
-What are you not saying?

994
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,550
-Nothing.
-Tell me.

995
01:03:04,526 --> 01:03:07,585
Maybe you should spend
real time in the projects...

996
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,527
...and then you wouldn't have to make up
speeches and memorize them.

997
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,066
You know, it would be coming
from someplace real.

998
01:03:15,235 --> 01:03:17,727
And how would you know?
 l mean....

999
01:03:17,905 --> 01:03:20,430
Because l grew up there.

1000
01:03:20,608 --> 01:03:23,599
l lived in a four-block radius
my whole life.

1001
01:03:23,777 --> 01:03:25,744
Bye.

1002
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:30,943
Okay, let's go.
 Come on.

1003
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:34,811
-Chris!
-What?

1004
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:39,289
Shall we? Okay? Let's go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

1005
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:42,655
Who the hell is she?

1006
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:48,735
l'll tell you who she isn't. She isn't like
anyone l've met. And she isn't a phony.

1007
01:03:48,903 --> 01:03:53,431
l'll make you a deal. You want me
at the benefit? Then get her to go.

1008
01:03:53,606 --> 01:03:57,702
l swear to God, l'll shake any
part of Maddox's body you want.

1009
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,945
Deal?

1010
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,644
Deal. All right,
 sure. Okay.

1011
01:04:12,293 --> 01:04:13,782
Okay, get in.

1012
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:21,692
So for right now, with the review
and everything going on...

1013
01:04:21,869 --> 01:04:24,166
...we need to be extra careful,
all right?

1014
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:27,068
That means no coming up
in the elevator to see me.

1015
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,436
And no Chris Marshall.

1016
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,875
-lt's not like you're breaking some law.
-Hey, l mean it.

1017
01:04:33,047 --> 01:04:34,412
lf you see him.
...

1018
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:39,383
-l'll make like a baby and head out first.
-Thank you. Go to bed, okay?

1019
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:42,421
-Good night, Ma.
-Bye, baby.

1020
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,227
Heads up!

1021
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:52,523
The Chinese delegation will be
checking into the Lexington Suite.

1022
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,535
Please note the television channel
needs to be set to one of the Chinese....

1023
01:04:56,704 --> 01:04:58,296
Oh, my God.
 Hide me.

1024
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:02,233
The Shapiros have requested
an early check-in.

1025
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,604
So we'll put them 
in the Dior Suite.

1026
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:06,268
Yes, sir?

1027
01:05:06,447 --> 01:05:08,347
-They're in the hall.
-What are they doing?

1028
01:05:08,514 --> 01:05:11,177
-He's got something in his hands.
-Does it look serious?

1029
01:05:11,352 --> 01:05:13,218
Calm down,
 it's just a letter.

1030
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:15,378
-Find that girl.
-Certainly.

1031
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:16,546
-He's coming.
-Be cool.

1032
01:05:16,724 --> 01:05:20,160
He's walking. Get out of here.
He's out of here.

1033
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:22,296
Thank you very much.
 That will be all.

1034
01:05:38,378 --> 01:05:40,608
Now....

1035
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,307
Are you truly interested
in management?

1036
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:46,885
Yes, very much,
 sir.

1037
01:05:47,756 --> 01:05:52,657
Then l suggest that you go
to the Met tonight...

1038
01:05:52,826 --> 01:05:57,854
...and end all association
with Chris Marshall.

1039
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:00,657
At least until you're a manager.

1040
01:06:01,135 --> 01:06:03,160
Then you can make 
your own rules.

1041
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,894
l'll make sure your 
shift is covered.

1042
01:06:21,889 --> 01:06:23,550
-Mari.
-What happened?

1043
01:06:23,724 --> 01:06:27,387
-You can still be a manager, right?
-Yeah, if l break it off with Chris.

1044
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:30,791
Break what off? No offense,
sweetheart. What planet are you on?

1045
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:32,625
You don't get it.
 None of you.

1046
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,858
There was something
different about him.

1047
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:36,297
Yeah,
 it's called money.

1048
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,461
-No, it's called--
-Don't say, ''love.''

1049
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,631
-Don't let her say it.
-She's going to.

1050
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:42,834
We connected,
 you know....

1051
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:46,309
-l felt it. Ty felt it too.
-Snap out of it, all right?

1052
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,278
You are not in love with this man.
He is not in love with you.

1053
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,713
You have no connections,
affiliations or loyalties.

1054
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:54,876
You're from two different worlds.
Do you hear me?

1055
01:06:55,055 --> 01:06:57,250
-l hear you.
-Me too.

1056
01:06:57,423 --> 01:06:59,017
l don't know.

1057
01:06:59,193 --> 01:07:02,218
Come on,
 Maris, you....

1058
01:07:02,396 --> 01:07:04,364
You could be manager!

1059
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,329
Think of it,
 girl. One of us...

1060
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:09,492
...out there!

1061
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:11,102
ln a blazer.

1062
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:13,364
Yeah.

1063
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,535
l don't have anything
to wear to this thing.

1064
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:20,407
-Honey, look, it's not what you got.
-Baby, it's who you know.

1065
01:07:20,581 --> 01:07:23,277
-And what they got.
-You got it?

1066
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,749
When you're a manager, your first
order of business is to get us--

1067
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:29,514
Raises!

1068
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:55,540
All right,
 Ty, focus.

1069
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,176
Eyes forward.

1070
01:08:57,344 --> 01:09:00,335
Once more.
This is the Harry Winston....

1071
01:09:00,513 --> 01:09:03,210
Wreath necklace. Worth more
than l'll see in 1 0 lifetimes.

1072
01:09:03,384 --> 01:09:07,112
Good. And if it leaves her neck
at any time, you'll....

1073
01:09:07,286 --> 01:09:10,620
Be put up for adoption
while my mom....

1074
01:09:12,426 --> 01:09:14,290
-Rots in prison!
-Excellent.

1075
01:09:18,966 --> 01:09:20,695
-You want to say hi to Harry?
-Harry.

1076
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:22,960
What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

1077
01:09:23,136 --> 01:09:24,467
Just your support,
 Harry.

1078
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:26,833
What about a cameo
on Saturday Night Live?

1079
01:09:27,005 --> 01:09:29,031
-Let's wait on that.
-l'm calling Lorne.

1080
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,370
-lt's nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

1081
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:44,320
-There they are. See them?
-l see them.

1082
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:48,052
We're going to line up Maddox's
support and get Grey's endorsement.

1083
01:09:48,228 --> 01:09:49,752
Just go and get it over with.

1084
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:53,525
-ls she here?
-She'll be here. She'll be here.

1085
01:09:56,304 --> 01:09:58,134
-Have fun, Ma.
-Thanks.

1086
01:09:58,304 --> 01:10:02,674
Listen, be good. Go to bed when
Steph tells you. No negotiating. Okay?

1087
01:10:02,844 --> 01:10:04,174
Oh, God.

1088
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:06,574
l can't breathe.

1089
01:10:07,214 --> 01:10:09,737
What am l doing here, Steph?
This is all a lie.

1090
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:12,545
No, honey.
lt's more like a dream, you know?

1091
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,982
For one night,
you're living it for all of us.

1092
01:10:15,155 --> 01:10:18,022
Don't think about tomorrow.
Just think about tonight.

1093
01:10:18,192 --> 01:10:20,125
Tonight,
 the maid is a lie.

1094
01:10:20,295 --> 01:10:24,594
And this,
 this is who you really are.

1095
01:10:49,022 --> 01:10:50,216
What do you think?

1096
01:10:50,389 --> 01:10:52,951
l think we have a lot
of issues to talk about.

1097
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:54,888
-Let's get together.
-Good.

1098
01:10:55,062 --> 01:10:58,554
Excuse me. l think now's
the perfect time if you'd like to....

1099
01:10:58,732 --> 01:11:01,165
Oh, my God, Jerry.
Look who's here.

1100
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:05,396
Lovely of you,
but l don't think l'll be in town.

1101
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:07,472
l'm gonna bring him over here.

1102
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:10,040
No. She should be here by now.
She's not coming.

1103
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:13,338
-She'll be here. She'll be here.
-She'd better be, Jerry.

1104
01:11:51,118 --> 01:11:53,085
You're beautiful.

1105
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:56,518
So are you.

1106
01:12:01,295 --> 01:12:03,592
Thank you for being here.

1107
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:09,527
l only came to tell 
you that this...

1108
01:12:09,703 --> 01:12:12,728
...you and me, can't go
anywhere beyond this evening.

1109
01:12:12,906 --> 01:12:14,533
lt just can't.

1110
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,743
Well, then, you should've
worn a different dress.

1111
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,750
Want to dance?

1112
01:12:49,442 --> 01:12:52,606
You have to listen.
l know you're used to getting your way.

1113
01:12:52,777 --> 01:12:55,179
Yeah,
 until l met you.

1114
01:12:57,018 --> 01:13:00,076
There's millions of women who are
dying for you to look their way.

1115
01:13:00,253 --> 01:13:03,780
Yeah? Then why are you
making me work so hard?

1116
01:13:03,956 --> 01:13:06,619
Chris? Hi.
Maddox is open.

1117
01:13:06,793 --> 01:13:08,920
So why don't you go over,
two minutes.

1118
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:11,495
-Jerry. l'm here--
-l'll take over. l know.

1119
01:13:14,768 --> 01:13:17,670
-Oh, Chris. Hi.
-Hello.

1120
01:13:19,237 --> 01:13:23,299
-What a night. l mean, who isn't here?
-Right.

1121
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:27,902
Do l need to know something
that l don't know already?

1122
01:13:28,848 --> 01:13:32,580
Well, that sounds like something
between you and your God, Jerry.

1123
01:13:32,753 --> 01:13:34,947
l like a good mystery,
 you know.

1124
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:37,750
But not where his girlfriends
are concerned.

1125
01:13:37,924 --> 01:13:39,414
l'm not his girlfriend.

1126
01:13:39,594 --> 01:13:42,118
Well, whatever.
l just need him focused.

1127
01:13:42,295 --> 01:13:44,058
-Sorry about that.
-Not at all.

1128
01:13:44,231 --> 01:13:45,893
-May l cut in?
-You certainly may.

1129
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:50,127
Where were we?
Right about here, wasn't it?

1130
01:13:50,304 --> 01:13:54,569
You better do what you're supposed
to because Jerry thinks l distract you.

1131
01:13:54,741 --> 01:14:00,475
Wait, wait. Never, never start
a sentence with ''Jerry thinks.''

1132
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:04,013
No, but you should 
do the right thing.

1133
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,754
Why are you smiling?

1134
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,688
Nothing, just until this minute,
l didn't know what that was.

1135
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,759
-But l do now.
-You do what?

1136
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:18,192
-Don't go anywhere.
-Chris, l didn't mean--

1137
01:14:18,365 --> 01:14:21,357
l'll be right back.
l'll be right back.

1138
01:14:43,557 --> 01:14:45,149
Excuse me.

1139
01:14:45,326 --> 01:14:47,350
Excuse me.
Haven't we met?

1140
01:14:47,527 --> 01:14:51,018
-l'm Caroline Lane and you're...?
-Sotheby's Caroline Lane?

1141
01:14:51,197 --> 01:14:53,130
-Yes.
-lt's wonderful to see you again.

1142
01:14:53,299 --> 01:14:57,496
l just knew we knew each other.
l never forget a face. Wow!

1143
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:00,161
ls that a Harry Winston wreath?

1144
01:15:00,339 --> 01:15:03,103
They haven't made
that design since the late '60s.

1145
01:15:03,277 --> 01:15:05,902
You're very good.
Excuse me, l have to go.

1146
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,048
Listen,
 just between us girls.

1147
01:15:09,216 --> 01:15:12,152
Are you here with Chris?

1148
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:14,652
-Can you keep a secret?
-Of course.

1149
01:15:14,821 --> 01:15:17,687
Good. So can l.

1150
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:28,156
Caroline.

1151
01:15:31,071 --> 01:15:33,039
Caroline.

1152
01:15:35,942 --> 01:15:37,307
Caroline.

1153
01:15:37,478 --> 01:15:40,206
-Do you have somewhere else to be?
-l have to leave.

1154
01:15:40,379 --> 01:15:42,005
You're not leaving.
 You're running.

1155
01:15:42,182 --> 01:15:45,152
What l can't figure out is, are you
running towards something you want?

1156
01:15:45,317 --> 01:15:48,879
Or are you running away from
something you're afraid to want?

1157
01:15:49,388 --> 01:15:51,719
Look, l've made
so many mistakes already.

1158
01:15:51,893 --> 01:15:56,261
-l just don't want to make it worse.
-You won't. l promise.

1159
01:15:56,728 --> 01:15:59,597
There's something
you don't know, okay?

1160
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:02,094
Oh, God.
 How do l tell you this?

1161
01:16:02,936 --> 01:16:07,396
-The first time you saw me, l was--
-You were mesmerizing.

1162
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,118
lf tonight is all we have...

1163
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:26,947
...stay.
 Please.

1164
01:18:11,531 --> 01:18:13,929
lt's over,
 baby.

1165
01:18:25,844 --> 01:18:28,005
Hi, honey.

1166
01:18:28,615 --> 01:18:30,478
l'm good.

1167
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:32,844
At work.

1168
01:18:33,018 --> 01:18:37,649
Listen, abuela's gonna be there in about
1 0 minutes, and l'll be home at 6.

1169
01:18:37,824 --> 01:18:40,348
Did you and Steph 
have a good time?

1170
01:18:40,527 --> 01:18:42,119
Yeah?

1171
01:18:56,576 --> 01:18:58,237
What are you gonna 
do in Buffalo?

1172
01:18:58,411 --> 01:19:01,607
Well, my plan is to sort of
accidentally bump into him.

1173
01:19:01,781 --> 01:19:04,978
-l mean, do you think that's too obvious?
-No.

1174
01:19:09,455 --> 01:19:12,391
-A Harry Winston wreath?
-Morning.

1175
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,889
lsn't that that maid?

1176
01:19:17,763 --> 01:19:20,857
l mean, where would a maid get
that necklace? l thought maybe--

1177
01:19:21,034 --> 01:19:24,731
l'll fast-forward through this, and you
just point her out if you see her.

1178
01:19:26,606 --> 01:19:29,804
Oh, wait, could you just
go back on that bit?

1179
01:19:32,844 --> 01:19:36,906
l mean,
 it could be her.

1180
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:40,679
Let's just--
Can we just go forward?

1181
01:19:44,591 --> 01:19:47,388
Wait!
 That's my Dolce coat!

1182
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,893
-How could you have missed that?
-l'm sorry, sir.

1183
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:55,893
l'll have maintenance
get there with a plunger.

1184
01:19:56,069 --> 01:19:59,504
And l'll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that.

1185
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:04,768
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bextrum wants
to see both of you in the Park Suite.

1186
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,731
Lionel. Marisa.

1187
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:32,996
Oh. Well, that's interesting.
She told me her name was Maria.

1188
01:20:33,173 --> 01:20:35,937
l thought it would be impolite
to correct you.

1189
01:20:36,109 --> 01:20:39,408
And l suppose you think
it's polite to steal people's clothes?

1190
01:20:41,548 --> 01:20:44,107
-l didn't steal--
-Miss Ventura, Mr. Bextrum has spent...

1191
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:47,549
...30 minutes trying to persuade
Miss Lane not to press charges.

1192
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:49,915
l suggest you say as 
little as possible.

1193
01:20:50,089 --> 01:20:51,920
We have it all on video.

1194
01:20:52,091 --> 01:20:53,752
Was everything returned?

1195
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:57,562
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, Chris, l'm terribly sorry...

1196
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:01,062
...to interrupt you. We thought you
should know what was going on.

1197
01:21:01,234 --> 01:21:03,896
-What is going on?
-The woman you thought was a guest...

1198
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:06,368
...on this floor is 
the maid on this floor.

1199
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:07,768
Aren't you,
 Marisa?

1200
01:21:07,942 --> 01:21:10,136
No. Wait,
 her name is Caroline.

1201
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:14,438
No, Chris, darling, that's my name.
She steals clothes, identities--

1202
01:21:14,612 --> 01:21:18,482
What the hell's happening here?
Why are you dressed that way?

1203
01:21:19,819 --> 01:21:21,616
Caroline?

1204
01:21:23,723 --> 01:21:25,350
ls this true?

1205
01:21:32,264 --> 01:21:33,926
Yeah, it is.

1206
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,359
Jesus Christ! The press is gonna
have a field day with this one.

1207
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:40,402
There's no reason 
to involve the press.

1208
01:21:40,572 --> 01:21:42,701
How will you prevent her
from speaking?

1209
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,808
This would never happen
at the Four Seasons.

1210
01:21:44,978 --> 01:21:48,036
l can assure you it has never
happened here before either.

1211
01:21:48,214 --> 01:21:52,275
Lionel, you are slipping. You should've
noticed something. l am disappointed.

1212
01:21:52,451 --> 01:21:55,112
Please, Mr. Bextrum,
he had nothing to do with this.

1213
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:57,777
Of course, sir.
 l understand.

1214
01:21:57,956 --> 01:22:01,324
We'll talk about this later.
Miss Ventura, you no longer work here.

1215
01:22:01,494 --> 01:22:03,393
Go to security,
hand in your passes...

1216
01:22:03,562 --> 01:22:05,862
...and you'll be escorted
from the building.

1217
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:10,161
-Yes, sir.
-ls that really necessary?

1218
01:22:10,335 --> 01:22:12,896
Chris, let the man do his job,
 okay?

1219
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:15,199
Oh, Chris.

1220
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:20,039
Oh, Chris. l can't help but feel
that this is partly my fault.

1221
01:22:20,213 --> 01:22:22,179
lt isn't.
 Spare yourself.

1222
01:22:22,348 --> 01:22:24,009
At least let me buy you lunch.

1223
01:22:24,183 --> 01:22:28,051
After all, we've only got each other
to get through this humiliation.

1224
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:33,179
Caroline, the first lunch was a mistake.
A second would be complete torture.

1225
01:22:33,692 --> 01:22:35,752
Drinks, then?

1226
01:22:35,929 --> 01:22:39,862
l need your nametag, passkey
and your lD card.

1227
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:43,799
-Sorry, Marisa, but l have to.
-l understand.

1228
01:22:44,937 --> 01:22:47,429
God, don't tell me
they fired you over this too.

1229
01:22:47,607 --> 01:22:49,165
No.

1230
01:22:49,342 --> 01:22:53,176
Actually, l made a decision
a moment ago.

1231
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:55,245
lt was long overdue.

1232
01:22:56,915 --> 01:22:58,781
You quit?

1233
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:00,920
Sometimes...

1234
01:23:01,085 --> 01:23:06,080
...we're forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves.

1235
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:08,625
Thank you.

1236
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,054
Thanks,
 Keef. Bye.

1237
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:15,293
To serve people...

1238
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:18,094
...takes dignity 
and intelligence.

1239
01:23:18,271 --> 01:23:22,138
But remember,
they're only people with money.

1240
01:23:22,308 --> 01:23:27,109
And although we serve them,
we are not their servants.

1241
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:32,808
What we do, Miss Ventura,
does not define who we are.

1242
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:38,286
What defines us is how
well we rise after falling.

1243
01:23:41,828 --> 01:23:45,161
l think you'll make a wonderful
manager someday.

1244
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,831
And it's been my great honor
to have worked with you.

1245
01:24:10,022 --> 01:24:11,819
Marisa?

1246
01:24:11,991 --> 01:24:15,051
Marisa! Caroline! Marisa!
l don't know which name to use.

1247
01:24:15,228 --> 01:24:17,161
Marisa.

1248
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:19,127
l don't get it.
 What just happened?

1249
01:24:19,298 --> 01:24:20,960
What don't you get?
 l'm the maid.

1250
01:24:21,134 --> 01:24:24,036
What was all this,
 some kind of bet?

1251
01:24:24,203 --> 01:24:26,137
A little game of what,
 get-the-guests?

1252
01:24:26,304 --> 01:24:28,772
l was trying on her clothes,
and you were there...

1253
01:24:28,942 --> 01:24:31,136
...and you invited
me out, and everything--

1254
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:33,972
And you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested?

1255
01:24:34,147 --> 01:24:35,409
Who's kidding who here?

1256
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,482
Think you would've looked at me
if you knew l was the maid?

1257
01:24:38,652 --> 01:24:39,639
-Well....
-Come on.

1258
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:41,719
With respect for
your big-hearted politics...

1259
01:24:41,888 --> 01:24:45,324
-...l don't think so, Mr. Assemblyman.
-You didn't give me a chance.

1260
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:49,655
You stand on your soapbox, judging
everyone, so sure they're judging you.

1261
01:24:49,829 --> 01:24:51,524
And you think they're not?

1262
01:24:51,696 --> 01:24:54,630
Come on. Half the time, l'm
a stereotype they make fun of.

1263
01:24:54,801 --> 01:24:58,259
The other half of the time, l'm
invisible. Maybe that's the point.

1264
01:24:58,437 --> 01:25:02,134
The first time you saw me, l was cleaning
your bathroom, only you didn't see me.

1265
01:25:02,308 --> 01:25:05,004
Was l supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak?

1266
01:25:05,179 --> 01:25:07,578
-You can't nail me for that.
-What are you doing?

1267
01:25:07,746 --> 01:25:08,871
Not now,
 Jerry. Just--

1268
01:25:09,048 --> 01:25:10,571
-Go.
-You might as well sell tickets.

1269
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,045
-l don't care.
-You care.

1270
01:25:13,987 --> 01:25:16,887
-No. No. No. No.
-Marisa.

1271
01:25:17,054 --> 01:25:18,580
l just want the truth.

1272
01:25:22,695 --> 01:25:25,186
All right,
 you want the truth?

1273
01:25:27,701 --> 01:25:31,136
There was a part of me
that wanted to see what it felt like...

1274
01:25:31,304 --> 01:25:35,240
...to have someone like you look
at me the way you did, just once.

1275
01:25:38,177 --> 01:25:39,871
And l'm sorry.

1276
01:25:40,045 --> 01:25:41,638
Truly.

1277
01:25:41,813 --> 01:25:45,409
lf l could rewind the past week,
l would.

1278
01:25:47,554 --> 01:25:49,350
Was any of it real?

1279
01:25:52,259 --> 01:25:54,783
Yeah,
 it was real.

1280
01:25:55,929 --> 01:25:59,795
lt was so real it made me wonder
how l was ever gonna give you up.

1281
01:26:02,735 --> 01:26:07,399
But l had to give you up.
That was the plan.

1282
01:26:10,143 --> 01:26:12,542
And then....

1283
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,112
Last night...

1284
01:26:16,449 --> 01:26:18,542
...l couldn't.

1285
01:28:09,562 --> 01:28:14,022
Rosalie from personnel called.
We expected you hours ago.

1286
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:15,460
Hi, baby.

1287
01:28:15,634 --> 01:28:17,625
She told me what happened.

1288
01:28:17,804 --> 01:28:20,636
Hey, Ma.
 You okay?

1289
01:28:20,804 --> 01:28:22,899
Scoot over,
 let me see your homework.

1290
01:28:23,076 --> 01:28:24,542
l don't know what to say.

1291
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:27,576
What are we gonna do for dinner?
You hungry, sweetie?

1292
01:28:27,746 --> 01:28:29,875
Will you look at me?

1293
01:28:30,049 --> 01:28:33,348
No.
 l'm gonna take a bath.

1294
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:41,188
Don't, Mom.

1295
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,853
What were you thinking,
going out with someone like that?

1296
01:28:45,031 --> 01:28:46,554
Someone like what?

1297
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,933
Chris Marshall.

1298
01:28:50,103 --> 01:28:52,900
You had to pretend to be somebody
so he'd go out with you?

1299
01:28:53,071 --> 01:28:56,063
Where is your pride,
 Marisa?

1300
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:58,643
People like you make people
like him a God.

1301
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:01,870
Why, because he's rich? White?
He has things we don't have...

1302
01:29:02,048 --> 01:29:03,947
...that we don't 
want to dream about?

1303
01:29:04,116 --> 01:29:07,812
lt must really burn you that l think
l have the right to go out with him.

1304
01:29:07,987 --> 01:29:10,455
You don't.

1305
01:29:10,755 --> 01:29:13,987
Ty, go to your room
and finish your homework, please.

1306
01:29:16,661 --> 01:29:19,495
-What happened to you?
-Don't speak to me like that.

1307
01:29:19,665 --> 01:29:22,496
l am not the one
who lost her job today.

1308
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:24,897
No, l did.
 l messed up.

1309
01:29:25,071 --> 01:29:29,201
Okay? lt's all my fault. You know what?
lt's all right. l'll be fine.

1310
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:31,900
You will because
we'll call SeÃ±ora Rodriguez.

1311
01:29:32,078 --> 01:29:36,446
-She owes me a favor. She has--
-l'm not calling Mrs. Rodriguez.

1312
01:29:36,615 --> 01:29:39,344
l love you,
 okay? l do.

1313
01:29:39,518 --> 01:29:42,384
But l don't want 
to clean houses.

1314
01:29:42,554 --> 01:29:44,682
There's nowhere 
to go from there.

1315
01:29:46,025 --> 01:29:51,326
Hasn't this taught you anything? Wake
up, little girl, you have responsibilities.

1316
01:29:51,496 --> 01:29:54,933
And they come every month
like clockwork.

1317
01:29:55,101 --> 01:29:57,194
You want to end up
back in the projects?

1318
01:29:57,369 --> 01:30:01,170
Keep dreaming dreams
that will never happen.

1319
01:30:01,339 --> 01:30:04,831
You want to put food on the table?
Call SeÃ±ora Rodriguez.

1320
01:30:09,214 --> 01:30:11,545
You're right,
 Ma.

1321
01:30:11,717 --> 01:30:14,241
l'm a good cleaning lady.

1322
01:30:14,652 --> 01:30:17,643
l'll start over.

1323
01:30:17,822 --> 01:30:19,848
But not with Mrs.
 Rodriguez.

1324
01:30:21,927 --> 01:30:25,089
l'm gonna find a job
as a maid in some hotel.

1325
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:29,634
After some time passes, l'm gonna
apply for the management program.

1326
01:30:29,802 --> 01:30:32,703
And when l get the chance
to be a manager....

1327
01:30:32,871 --> 01:30:36,399
And l will, Ma.
 l know l will.

1328
01:30:36,576 --> 01:30:39,304
l'm going to take
that chance without any fear.

1329
01:30:39,478 --> 01:30:43,244
Without your voice
in my head telling me that l can't.

1330
01:30:48,987 --> 01:30:50,045
Did you see this?

1331
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:53,585
-How did it start?
-Did he know you were a maid?

1332
01:30:53,759 --> 01:30:56,592
-Are you a Beresford perk?
-How long were you involved?

1333
01:30:56,762 --> 01:30:58,094
How did they find you out?

1334
01:30:58,263 --> 01:31:00,664
Any advice to other maids
looking to trade up?

1335
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:03,527
-Did Democrats put you up to this?
-Does he tip well?

1336
01:31:03,701 --> 01:31:05,932
ls it true you're booked
on Larry King Live?

1337
01:31:06,103 --> 01:31:08,594
I'm at the Beresford Hotel,
where yesterday...

1338
01:31:08,774 --> 01:31:12,574
...Senate hopeful Chris Marshall was
captured on video in a lovers' spat...

1339
01:31:12,745 --> 01:31:15,679
...with a woman now identified
as a hotel maid.

1340
01:31:15,848 --> 01:31:17,371
Who's kidding who here?

1341
01:31:17,549 --> 01:31:20,542
Think you would've looked
at me if you knew I was the maid?

1342
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,914
-With respect--
-Oh, shit.

1343
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:25,317
Oh, my God.

1344
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:28,051
We won't--
We will not be answering--

1345
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:31,060
We will not be taking
any questions right now.

1346
01:31:31,228 --> 01:31:34,199
Mr. Marshall will 
make a statement.

1347
01:31:39,205 --> 01:31:40,933
Morning.

1348
01:31:41,106 --> 01:31:43,232
l'd like to make 
a short statement.

1349
01:31:43,409 --> 01:31:47,139
And it will be all
that l have to say about this....

1350
01:31:47,312 --> 01:31:50,612
This invasion of my privacy.

1351
01:31:52,817 --> 01:31:55,878
l happened to meet
Miss Ventura and her son...

1352
01:31:56,054 --> 01:32:01,994
...during my stay
at a hotel in New York.

1353
01:32:03,027 --> 01:32:05,292
And we became friends.

1354
01:32:07,533 --> 01:32:11,902
There are people from all walks
of life who I count as friends.

1355
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:15,973
And my only regret in this instance
is that one of them, Miss Ventura...

1356
01:32:18,744 --> 01:32:22,009
...was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media...

1357
01:32:22,179 --> 01:32:25,878
...as a result of that 
friendship with me.

1358
01:32:35,295 --> 01:32:39,389
l need these numbers
to be plus 1 0 percent.

1359
01:33:00,886 --> 01:33:03,353
Welcome to the 
employee cafeteria.

1360
01:33:06,326 --> 01:33:09,158
lt's open 2 4 hours a day.
...

1361
01:33:09,728 --> 01:33:11,491
Please.

1362
01:33:29,313 --> 01:33:31,408
ls today the 1 9th?

1363
01:33:31,583 --> 01:33:33,710
Six more shopping days.

1364
01:33:33,886 --> 01:33:35,513
He's here.
 He's back!

1365
01:33:35,687 --> 01:33:39,817
-Who? What are you reading?
-Yesterday's paper. Chris is in town.

1366
01:33:39,991 --> 01:33:42,393
So? Go put your clothes on.
lt's late.

1367
01:33:42,561 --> 01:33:44,960
So? He's giving a press conference.
Guess where?

1368
01:33:45,129 --> 01:33:48,759
l don't care. Okay? Come on.
Put your turtleneck on too. lt's cold.

1369
01:33:48,933 --> 01:33:50,458
At your hotel.

1370
01:33:50,636 --> 01:33:51,795
-Ma!
-What?

1371
01:33:51,969 --> 01:33:53,062
At your hotel!

1372
01:33:53,237 --> 01:33:55,433
l heard you,
 bubba!

1373
01:33:55,607 --> 01:33:59,543
Don't you think it's weird?
You'll be there, he'll be there.

1374
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:03,213
So will a thousand other people.
We talked about this.

1375
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:05,850
You have your
turtleneck on backwards.

1376
01:34:06,018 --> 01:34:07,746
l thought we talked about this.

1377
01:34:08,253 --> 01:34:09,914
l know,
 but it's like fate.

1378
01:34:10,089 --> 01:34:14,719
No, it's like New York City
and an available conference room.

1379
01:34:14,893 --> 01:34:16,621
You knew,
 didn't you?

1380
01:34:16,795 --> 01:34:19,821
You weren't gonna tell me.
You knew he was coming.

1381
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,060
Remember, bubba, what l told you?
We talked about this.

1382
01:34:24,503 --> 01:34:28,530
He's not part of our lives,
but we wish him luck with his, right?

1383
01:34:29,509 --> 01:34:30,804
You think he misses us?

1384
01:34:35,714 --> 01:34:38,705
Well,
 he'd be crazy not to.

1385
01:35:02,141 --> 01:35:05,009
Mr. Marshall, if elected,
you'll be the third Marshall...

1386
01:35:05,177 --> 01:35:08,304
...to serve New York in the Senate.
How does it feel?

1387
01:35:08,478 --> 01:35:10,844
lf l get elected,
 l'll let you know.

1388
01:35:12,683 --> 01:35:14,585
Did your father
leave you any advice?

1389
01:35:14,753 --> 01:35:18,120
Yeah, he said,
 ''Don't run.''

1390
01:35:19,357 --> 01:35:21,518
We have time
for one more question, folks.

1391
01:35:21,692 --> 01:35:24,127
Then we have
a meet-and-greet in the Green Room.

1392
01:35:24,295 --> 01:35:26,263
l have a question.

1393
01:35:27,466 --> 01:35:32,129
-What? Who said that?
-Mr. Marshall, down here.

1394
01:35:33,504 --> 01:35:34,995
Sure.

1395
01:35:35,174 --> 01:35:37,505
What's your question?

1396
01:35:39,045 --> 01:35:40,136
l was wondering.
...

1397
01:35:40,312 --> 01:35:43,612
-Chris, don't do this.
-No. Wait. l'm listening. Go ahead.

1398
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:44,875
Well....

1399
01:35:45,918 --> 01:35:48,647
l know everyone makes mistakes.

1400
01:35:48,821 --> 01:35:53,313
And it's a sign of character to give
a person a second chance, right?

1401
01:35:53,491 --> 01:35:56,187
Right.
 l'm with you.

1402
01:35:57,562 --> 01:36:01,625
Even if someone lied,
they should be forgiven.

1403
01:36:01,799 --> 01:36:05,063
Otherwise, we'd never have
any congressmen or presidents.

1404
01:36:07,071 --> 01:36:09,335
Thanks very much.
We have to wrap this up.

1405
01:36:09,509 --> 01:36:12,033
Jerry, he's not done.
 Go on.

1406
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:17,808
Well, what if you're not a politician
trying to do good for everybody?

1407
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:21,350
What if you're just a regular person,
like a maid or something?

1408
01:36:23,522 --> 01:36:26,150
And she made a mistake.

1409
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:29,192
Do you think she should
get a second chance?

1410
01:36:29,362 --> 01:36:31,192
l mean, nobody's perfect,
 right?

1411
01:36:32,164 --> 01:36:35,725
No.
 Nobody's perfect.

1412
01:36:36,502 --> 01:36:39,994
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
take a look at a future candidate.

1413
01:36:40,938 --> 01:36:44,603
All right, thanks very much, folks.
We'll see you all in Buffalo.

1414
01:36:44,777 --> 01:36:50,009
-Don't do this. Don't throw it all--
-l'm just trusting my instincts here.

1415
01:36:54,554 --> 01:36:56,214
-Great speech.
-Really?

1416
01:36:56,554 --> 01:36:59,080
-Eating out of your hands.
-Thanks.

1417
01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:05,619
Cool.

1418
01:37:06,598 --> 01:37:08,621
Where is she?

1419
01:37:10,969 --> 01:37:12,629
This way!

1420
01:37:21,914 --> 01:37:25,246
-Have you seen Marisa Ventura?
-No, l haven't seen Marisa.

1421
01:37:41,732 --> 01:37:43,860
We haven't had this
kind of story in a while.

1422
01:37:44,036 --> 01:37:45,161
lt will kill his career.

1423
01:37:45,536 --> 01:37:48,004
Will this hurt your
announcement for senator?

1424
01:37:48,173 --> 01:37:53,634
Mr. Marshall, are you still seeing her?
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Marshall?

1425
01:37:56,481 --> 01:37:56,982
-Marisa?
-Hey, Ma.

1426
01:37:56,982 --> 01:37:58,176
-Marisa?
-Hey, Ma.

1427
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:03,378
Ty? What are you both
doing down here? What's--?

1428
01:38:15,534 --> 01:38:17,295
Hello.

1429
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:20,893
-Hi.
-Hi.

1430
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:22,870
Look....

1431
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:26,771
Can we start over?

1432
01:38:26,945 --> 01:38:29,411
Second chance,
 second date?

1433
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,911
You as you,
 me as me.

1434
01:38:32,085 --> 01:38:34,277
No secrets.

1435
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,884
What do you think?

1436
01:38:37,388 --> 01:38:41,620
-We know you're in there!
-Open up! Only one way out.

1437
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:54,161
Marisa Ventura.

1438
01:38:55,741 --> 01:38:57,936
Housekeeping.

1439
01:38:58,744 --> 01:39:02,578
Chris Marshall.
 Candidate for Senate.

1440
01:39:03,014 --> 01:39:04,676
l'd appreciate your vote.

1441
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,014
We'll see.

1442
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,420
We're in!

1443
01:39:12,591 --> 01:39:14,786
Mr. Marshall,
 over here!

1444
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,951
Mr. Marshall.

1445
01:39:27,638 --> 01:39:28,902
Mira.

1446
01:39:29,074 --> 01:39:30,665
Esa es mi hija.

1447
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:33,076
What's your relationship...

1448
01:39:33,245 --> 01:39:37,011
-...with the Latin community?
-Excellent. He speaks Latin-- Spanish.

1449
01:39:41,186 --> 01:39:43,177
Miss Ventura, will you
clean up the Senate?

1450
01:39:43,353 --> 01:39:47,655
What do you think, sir?
You two got a chance? Sir?
