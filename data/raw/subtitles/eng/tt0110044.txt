You will simply
refuse him and that will be that.

- Well... you have to leave.

- What do you mean I have to leave?
- Here. $100.

338
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,647
- We'll drive you to the bus stop.
It'll take you to the city.
- You can't just kick me out.

Nobody wants to kick you out,
but we have no choice.

As an outsider, you are
not allowed to remain here.

but it is the best.

I'm sorry.

the duty of the brother-in-law. Ask her.

done with.

12 years old. I still hate girls.

- Don't disgrace yourself in the eyes of God!

349
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,018
- Ask her, please.
- But I'd make a bad husband.

350
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,355
- Don't make me do this.
- You must, child!

but let's not throw the baby out
with the bathwater, okay?

364
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,317
[Chuckles] If you would have told me
out on the street that the Bible...

365
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:41,364
is the happening book that I now think it is,
you could've knocked me over with a feather.

But, guys, I have seen the light.

I could stick around here...

368
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,792
and soak up more of this religion stuff
is to get hitched to the little midget...

369
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,878

has got to go.

- It's not our place to challenge the Lord!

We do not believe that our brother colonies
would be so literal to the written word.

- We will be ridiculed!
- This is correct!

- None of them will believe us!
- No one will.

00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:27,077

anything about children!

01:23:35,056 --> 01:23:37,017
Back off, fellas. F.B.I.

1005
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,811
[Havana]
Zeke? Zeke?

1006
01:23:39,894 --> 01:23:42,022
F.B.I. Okay?

1007
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:45,567
- Stop him, stop him!
- It's over, everybody. Relax.

1008
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:49,988
- She's got an air conditioned cab.
- [Tractor Motor Starts]

1009
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:51,823
Hey, wait! Hey!

1010
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:53,742
[Honking]

1011
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,582
Get off of me, you bitch!

1012
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:12,594
No, no. Put me down.

1013
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:21,061
Put me down.! I'm F.B. I...!

1014
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:24,522
[Cheering]

1015
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,901
Put me down.
Put me down!

1016
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:47,212
[Zeke]
You have to let her go!

1017
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:50,882
She helped me! You can't
take her to jail. She's my wife!

1018
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:53,385
Your wife.

1019
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:56,805
He's my husband. If you have a problem
with me, then just deal with me.

1020
01:24:56,888 --> 01:24:59,140
Leave him out of it.
He's a good man.

1021
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:04,646
- A man.
- He's the biggest man I know.
So, he's not the tallest.

1022
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:09,776
You're the F.B.I.
What do I do?

1023
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:13,321
It's up to you, sir.
You want to press charges?

1024
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:16,574
She was wrong to help
my brother, but she's changed!

1025
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:19,452
I couldn't have
returned it without her.

1026
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:22,205
We had to spend some of it
on the way, but...

1027
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:25,667
But whatever's missing, I'll work to
pay it back. I'll do whatever you want.

1028
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,877
Just don't take her to jail.

1029
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:31,965
Well, I don't know.
She sure did make some fool outta me.

1030
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:40,223
Um, could you
come here please, sir?

1031
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:47,480
Chapter 26, verse 6.

1032
01:25:47,605 --> 01:25:51,901
"To forgive a woman with stain
in her hands, but health in her heart...

1033
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:56,364
"makes a higher man
ofhe who forgiveth.

1034
01:25:56,489 --> 01:26:00,869
"And God
shall such remember...

1035
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:04,539
"when such a day of final
reckoning comes forth.

1036
01:26:04,664 --> 01:26:10,253
For he shall be coveted
as a man among men."

1037
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:16,343
Sir, I think thatJob
was speaking to you.

1038
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:22,015
Look, son...

1039
01:26:22,098 --> 01:26:26,895
the state fair has offered a $25,000 reward
for the return of this money.

1040
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:30,357
That's for you!

1041
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:33,568
No, I don't want
any reward.

1042
01:26:33,693 --> 01:26:35,695
I just want my wife.

1043
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:42,035
I don't know if you're crazy,
orjust crazy for this woman.

1044
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,371
But you got a deal!

1045
01:26:46,706 --> 01:26:48,583
[Men Laughing]

1046
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:06,768
- Welcome home, Ezekiel.
- Thanks.

1047
01:27:10,313 --> 01:27:12,440
Sorry about that.

1048
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:16,444
I deserved it.

1049
01:27:16,569 --> 01:27:19,614
Thanks for saving me back there
at the fair.

1050
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:23,368
You saved me back with
that quote from the Bible.

1051
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,121
I'm gonna have
to thankJob one day.

1052
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:30,750
No. Thank me.
I made it up.

1053
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:34,462
But I don't thinkJob would be mad.
It was for a good cause.

1054
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:39,467
You actually think I could turn out
to be a good cause, hmm?

1055
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:41,553
You already are!

1056
01:27:46,516 --> 01:27:48,810
Friends forever?

1057
01:27:52,188 --> 01:27:54,482
Forever and a day.

1058
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:58,820
Okay.

1059
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:05,452
Ah, where are you going
to go to now?

1060
01:28:05,535 --> 01:28:08,288
Home to see my family.

1061
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:14,919
Havana,
will I ever see you again?

1062
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:19,007
No...
but you'll see Betsy.

1063
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,184
[Laughing]

1064
01:28:29,309 --> 01:28:32,187
We're doing that again
in ten years!

1065
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:36,649
If you don't, I will!
