1
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:36,807
Just get the fuckin'
coffee and let's go.

2
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,199
This ain't exactly Brazil.

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,567
I could pissed ya a fuckin' cup by now.

4
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,350
Hey! You're out of chocolate mac.

5
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,638
Sorry.
No chocolate macadamia.

6
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,647
You would please
have something else?

7
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,448
Fuckin' hazelnut...

8
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,854
That will be $1.08.

9
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:25,734
That sign says
"All Coffee 69 Cents."

10
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,184
I am very sorry,
but that is a 44-ounce cup, -

11
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,601
- and the largest
coffee cup is 20 ounces.

12
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:32,521
Therefore, I must charge you -

13
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,406
- 99 cents, plus tax, -

14
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,361
- the price of a large fountain drink.

15
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,242
That's bullshit. That sign says:
"Coffee All Sizes" -

16
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:41,961
- not "All Sizes Up to 20 Ounces".

17
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:44,970
I am humbly sorry, but you
must pay 99 cents plus tax -

18
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:45,992
- for that cup.

19
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:47,944
Just pay the bitch the $1.08 -

20
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,057
- and let's get the fuck out of here.

21
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:51,928
All right.

22
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,570
This is bullshit. Just give me
my fuckin Snackie Cake.

23
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:57,354
I am sorry.
I cannot do that.

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,825
That is only available -

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,201
- with the 20-ounce coffee.

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,255
That is not a 20-ounce coffee.

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,170
This bitch is gettin'
on my nerves, man. Forget it.

28
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,091
- Just give him the fuckin' danish.
- That sign says:

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,402
"Free Snackie Cake"

30
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,961
I paid $ 1.08 for my coffee.
I want my free Snackie Cake.

31
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,050
I cannot do that.

32
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,795
Here. Take it.

33
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,587
That's apple cinnamon.
I wanted cream cheese.

34
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:21,483
Fuck's sake. Pay her
the money and let's go.

35
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,259
Either of you got
something smaller than a Ben?

36
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,331
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:38,803
I cannot accept
any monies over a $20 bill.

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,627
- That's it.
- I should not sell it to you, anyway...

39
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:46,443
As that cup is very hot
and might burn you.

40
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:47,812
You are very strange.

41
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:49,844
I'm going to call the police.

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,212
Fuck this.

43
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,290
Fuck me.

44
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,845
Give me a smock.

45
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:16,414
How you doing tonight?

46
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,790
Fine.

47
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:19,053
How about yourself?

48
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:20,845
I'm doing okay.

49
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:22,894
Need a cup of coffee, though.

50
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,326
Hmm... raspberry blend.

51
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,485
It's on the house.

52
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:38,606
You sure?

53
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,045
Hey man, here you are -

54
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:42,095
- out chasing bad guys
at 4:00 in the morning -

55
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,016
- while I'm sitting here like a duck...

56
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,640
It's the least I can do.

57
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,744
I appreciate it.

58
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,136
Smell something funny?

59
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,615
Yeah, one of our coolers went down.

60
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,536
Spoiled a lot of shit.

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,421
Sorry.

62
00:03:57,456 --> 00:04:00,136
Hey man, if you can stand it -

63
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:03,447
- it don't bother me none.
You got to work in it.

64
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,417
Mind if I, uh...

65
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,601
- ask you a question?

66
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,416
Go ahead, officer.

67
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:15,727
Tell me, who do you like better:
Picard or Kirk?

68
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:17,808
Oh, there's no question about it.

69
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,104
- Kirk.
- You bet.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,416
You got to respect a man
who can fuck a green bitch -

71
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,416
- and destroy a whole
civilization all in 60 minutes.

72
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:27,777
Good night.

73
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,358
Thought we had a problem.

74
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,018
I almost forgot...
my free Snackie Cake.

75
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:10,938
- Hello?
- This is the operator.

76
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,619
I have a collect call from Nick.

77
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,340
- Who?
- From a "Nick", will you accept charges?

78
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,660
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Go ahead, sir.

79
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:22,012
- Nick?
- Case?

80
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:27,652
Look, uh, I'm coming through
Houston tomorrow morning.

81
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,012
I was wondering if I might come see you.

82
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:34,172
- Oh, I don't know, bro. Why?
- Things have changed.

83
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:36,346
I'm getting married.

84
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,845
I was hoping I could stay
a couple days, you know?

85
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,380
Catch up?

86
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:07,810
Jesus.

87
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:15,282
What do you want me to say?
"I'm sorry, bro, my wife's...

88
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:17,170
"going to be a little tired
when she gets home tonight.

89
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:19,074
Here's 20 bucks.
There's a La Quinta up the highway."

90
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:22,183
I thought maybe you'd want him to meet me.
If he's such a good friend, -

91
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,983
- why haven't I heard
about him before, hmm?

92
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,268
I told you.

93
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:29,142
I was kind of in the wrong
path when I was in L.A.

94
00:06:29,143 --> 00:06:32,183
I chose to get my shit
together. He didn't.

95
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,902
What time is it?
Oh, shit!

96
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,798
I'm going to miss my plane.
I got to go. Bye.

97
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,975
- What about breakfast?
- No, sorry. No time.

98
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,039
Okay...

99
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:45,855
Chris, don't plan anything
tomorrow night. It's opening night.

100
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,016
I planned dinner with
Allen tomorrow night.

101
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:51,221
Why didn't you remind me?

102
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,344
Chris, I've been working on
this club for eight months.

103
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,504
He's the C.E.O.
I have to be there.

104
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,848
Every critic in town will be there.
We can't miss it.

105
00:06:57,944 --> 00:07:02,132
We'll work something out. Just don't
forget your appointment with Dr. Jarvis.

106
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,305
Casey, you know this adoption is...

107
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,417
Yeah, I know.

108
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,025
- It'll be fine.
- You want me to take you?

109
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,785
No. I'll drive.
I'm taking the Mustang.

110
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:16,408
- I love you.
- I love you too. Bye.

111
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,539
Turn around and put
your hands on the wall.

112
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:58,424
What?

113
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:03,258
Turn around... and put
your hands on that wall.

114
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,178
You're kidding, right?

115
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,027
You're not going to try
and fuck me are you?

116
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,113
You wish.

117
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:16,988
This isn't exactly how
I envisioned our reunion going.

118
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:20,988
Oh, God... damn!

119
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,753
You had me going.

120
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:27,532
Goddamn, good to see you.
Come on.

121
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,355
Finally, I ended up in Texas.

122
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,100
That was about a year ago.

123
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,541
I had a little money,
got into mineral leases -

124
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:34,906
- and I've been, uh...

125
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,389
- working between here
and L.A. ever since.

126
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:39,461
Looks like we both escaped.

127
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,620
No shit.

128
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,466
Look at you.

129
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:48,669
You look like that wolf
that got taken in as a pet...

130
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,107
- all dumb and domesticated.

131
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:55,581
You want a beer?

132
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:58,029
When's the last time you had
a beer at 8:00 in the morning?

133
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,110
About three and a half years ago.

134
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:03,202
- Well, let me get them.
- No, I'll get them.

135
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,989
Sit down, I'm closer.

136
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,690
- That woman's got you trained, doesn't she?
- They're not in there.

137
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,083
They're in the fridge in
the garage. I'll get them.

138
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:14,783
Two fridges.

139
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,183
Welcome to suburbia.

140
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:22,184
What the fuck?

141
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,991
- What?
- What the hell is this?

142
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,112
- It's Soy Moo.
- Yeah, I can see that.

143
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:28,637
What's it for?

144
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:31,492
That's a milk substitute.

145
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:33,888
We're very health conscious.

146
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:35,392
There's no meat...

147
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:41,444
- no dairy... nothing.

148
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,297
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

149
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:45,408
Three happy years -

150
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:48,311
- of veggie burgers and acidophilus.

151
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:50,264
Those are scrambled eggs.

152
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,480
Scrambled Tofutti.

153
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:55,288
Fuck, dude, Rod Serling's -

154
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,505
- going to step out
of that fridge any second.

155
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,005
Nick?

156
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:07,998
What?

157
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,953
Does that look like a trash can to you?

158
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:12,834
Oh. Sorry, bro.

159
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,679
Under the sink, man.

160
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,634
So you're an architect, huh?

161
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,785
Yep.

162
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,386
- You're good.
- Nah.

163
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,435
No, seriously,
you're really fucking good.

164
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,034
Thanks.

165
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,777
She know?

166
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,906
Not... even... a clue.

167
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,672
Never.

168
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,555
I fly out tonight for "Paree".

169
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,579
"Yeah", "that's right."

170
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,459
You're fixing to tie
that knot yourself.

171
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:50,240
Who's the lucky girl?

172
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,195
Aw, just some French chick.

173
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:55,778
Man, you sound head over heels.

174
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,921
Nervous, I guess.

175
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,076
Nothing wrong
with living in France.

176
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,708
No extradition.

177
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,115
What?

178
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,634
I'm just kidding.

179
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,509
Say, I've got some errands to run.

180
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,491
You mind if I borrow your car?

181
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,308
Help yourself.

182
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,189
Hell, I got a floor plan
that was due last Monday.

183
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,114
I'm not going anywhere.

184
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,276
Let's throw your bags
into the guest, uh... bedroom here.

185
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,028
Fuck, bro.

186
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,477
It's really good seeing you.

187
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:45,957
Ooh!

188
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,410
Beamer... Nice!

189
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:50,991
- Insurance is in the glove box.
- Got it.

190
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,871
And the, uh, spare is in the... trunk.

191
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:55,591
No problem. Thanks.

192
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,319
Don't mention it.

193
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:00,702
It's a fucking station wagon!

194
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,479
<i>- Hey, what can I get you?
- Just coffee.</i>

195
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:30,619
Hi.

196
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,813
Have a seat.

197
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,044
Thanks.

198
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,760
What can I do for you?

199
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:43,561
You, uh, look pretty tired.

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,300
Well, it's 1:00 in the morning.
I can't imagine why.

201
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:50,279
Well, you're kind of a dick, aren't you?

202
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,125
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,041
I guess I just haven't acclimatized yet.

204
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,065
I was in L.A.

205
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:59,753
Los Angeles? Oh.

206
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,153
Took some time off.

207
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:07,593
You know, for six weeks
you come in here...

208
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,979
- every night, alone, I might add -

209
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:12,233
- and you sit here,
and you study for hours.

210
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:15,641
And every night I wait on you,
and you don't even notice me.

211
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:17,214
How come?

212
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,042
It's not that I...
I mean, I noticed.

213
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,928
I mean, you... You're...

214
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:24,479
- Fuck, I'm just trying to get through this.
- So, here it is, -

215
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,762
- Friday night, and here you sit.

216
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,043
And I'm thinking either, one:

217
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,395
You know, you're just a total geek.

218
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,487
Or two: you don't have any friends.

219
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:35,222
And you don't look
like a geek, so, uh...

220
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,602
- I was wondering if
you'd like to go, uh...

221
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:39,314
- get some breakfast?

222
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,036
You don't even know me.

223
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,973
Oh, uh... I'm Christine.

224
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:48,945
- You are?
- Casey.

225
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,883
Casey. Casey. Okay, good.

226
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:54,135
Wait.

227
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,035
What?

228
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:59,604
- Tell me, why is it so fucking difficult?
- What?

229
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:03,204
This relationship.

230
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,865
Why is it so... difficult?

231
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,710
I'm busting my ass here -

232
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,593
- to be the perfect husband for you...

233
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:13,633
- and the harder I work,
the less you care.

234
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:15,690
I love you, and...

235
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:19,596
- you care more about your
career than you care about me.

236
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,517
Casey, I do love you...

237
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,136
- but you are boring the shit,
out of me.

238
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:27,345
You are working so fucking hard
to be what you think I want -

239
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:28,929
- instead of giving me what I need.

240
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:31,617
Quit trying so hard.
Why don't you just be yourself?

241
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,814
I don't want Fred Mac Murray, Casey.

242
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,885
I want you.

243
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:39,674
You, the cocky,
determined guy, full of life.

244
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,562
- Full of...
- You wouldn't like who I am.

245
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:46,406
I married you!
I love you.

246
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,443
I don't want
to lose you, Christine.

247
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,207
Christine!

248
00:15:56,433 --> 00:16:01,489
There is nothing in that case
but a pack of legal documents.

249
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:05,010
Maybe a box of condoms.

250
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,651
That's it.

251
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,019
Yeah?

252
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,403
I just want to know one thing.

253
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:27,136
What kind of fucking drugs are you on?

254
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,131
What?

255
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:33,492
I want to know what kind
of "fucking drugs" you were on -

256
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,973
- to make you think you could
bring fucking smack into my house!

257
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:41,435
- That briefcase was locked, Case.
- Yeah? Sue me!

258
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,537
That wasn't very trusting
of you to go through my shit.

259
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:46,452
This ain't exactly me borrowing
your trading cards here, Beave.

260
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:49,332
You brought shit into my house!
Into my home!

261
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,708
Which I invited you
into as my fucking guest!

262
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,609
You know what they did
in ancient Rome -

263
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,900
- when a visitor violated
somebody's hospitality?

264
00:16:55,964 --> 00:17:00,405
They cut off his dick and they
nailed it to the fucking gate!

265
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,770
See, this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

266
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,653
I knew that you would have very
little enthusiasm for this deal.

267
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:07,574
I had a little business
to finish up in Houston -

268
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,459
- and I wanted to tell you
"Adios" face to face.

269
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,374
I want you to pedal your ass
back here, pick up your shit, -

270
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:13,734
- get the fuck out of my house.

271
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,219
No can do, buddy.

272
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:18,259
I appreciate your situation,
but I told you...

273
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:21,015
I got a little unfinished
business to take care of.

274
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:26,102
- So what?
- A little unfinished business.

275
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:28,599
If you're not back here in 15 minutes, -

276
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,605
- you're going to have to pick up your
shit from the police evidence room.

277
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:32,531
And tell 'em what?

278
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,486
Your ex-partner
just happened to stop by -

279
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,606
- with a basketful of goodies -

280
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:39,221
- and you felt it was your moral
obligation to turn him in?

281
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,726
- I don't think so.
- Look, you lame piece of shit.

282
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,735
I am having a little bit of trouble -

283
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,295
- coming up with reasons, not to blow
the back of your fucking head off!

284
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,736
You're not sounding like that happy
little suburbanite I saw this morning.

285
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,621
Don't forget.

286
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,541
Never can tell who's listening in.

287
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,956
Just watch my shit, Case.
I'll be back in a couple of hours, -

288
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,695
- I'll pick up my bags and I'll split.

289
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,261
Watch your shit?

290
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:03,703
You're not hearing me, Nick. Get...

291
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:06,137
Sorry, Case, time's up. Gotta go.

292
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,384
Nick.

293
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:11,894
Nick!

294
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:15,076
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

295
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,591
Say, man, you got the wrong house.

296
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,011
I didn't order any pizza.

297
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,866
What?

298
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,466
I said you got the wrong house!
I didn't order the pizza!

299
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:07,610
- This ain't your pizza, no?
- No.

300
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,719
What kind is it?

301
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,931
Meat lover's.

302
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:15,260
I'll tell you what...

303
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:16,911
How much is it?
I'll buy if off you.

304
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:20,460
No, man. No can do, no?
You ain't ordered the pizza, -

305
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,931
- I can't sell it to you.
- What are you going to do with it, take it back?

306
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:25,624
I'm offering to buy it from you.

307
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:27,011
Tell you what...

308
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:30,652
I'll sell you this one if you
let me use your phone, yeah?

309
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,211
Deal. Come on in.

310
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:40,221
You know what happens
if I pull this trigger?

311
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:43,644
- Do you?
- You repaint my ceiling.

312
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,981
Yeah, man.

313
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,902
You know why I'm here, yeah?

314
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,376
Collecting for D.A.R.E.?

315
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:56,842
Okay, you give me the shit,
and it's over real quick like.

316
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,270
Yeah.

317
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,013
Yeah. well, I hope you can swim.

318
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:03,493
- I put it down the disposal.
- You put it in the drain?

319
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,442
Every milligram.

320
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:08,059
Okay.

321
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,579
Why you forcing me
to pain you now?

322
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,819
Look, motherfucker,
I don't have a clue -

323
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:16,734
- what's going on here,
and I really don't care.

324
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:19,303
Check it out, professor.

325
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,719
Why would you do such a thing?

326
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:36,863
I'm not a drug dealer.
I don't want that crap in my house.

327
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:39,743
This too much for me.

328
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,543
Yes, sir.

329
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,455
No, I'm here, man.

330
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,341
No, he don't have it.

331
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,328
Him put it in the sink, yo.

332
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,899
I checked, no man,
he straight-up done it.

333
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,063
Him say he don't want it,
in his house no more, yeah?

334
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,984
No, I'm not a drug dealer.

335
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,785
You sure, yeah? But...

336
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:06,625
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

337
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,510
Got it.

338
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:12,353
Sorry, man.
But you got to go.

339
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:15,025
Him doubly pissed now
that you trashed it, yeah.

340
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,366
I have a little favor to ask.

341
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,640
Favor?

342
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,785
I think I could use a little ganj.

343
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,826
Yeah, man.

344
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:02,847
Die.

345
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:09,060
Hydroponic, man.

346
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,979
Yeah.

347
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:14,788
Oh, yeah.

348
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:25,348
Feel that.

349
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:46,501
You fond of music, man?

350
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,021
What?

351
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:53,286
You think I do this
'cause I like killing people, huh?

352
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,070
No-no.

353
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:59,221
Ga-ga music is my life, yeah.

354
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:01,773
I have aspirations, yeah.

355
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,118
That's what I do on the radio.

356
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,590
I'm this close to a record deal.

357
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,475
Then...

358
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,830
No more of the killing.

359
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,484
It's time, man.
Dog day, yeah?

360
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:50,792
I'm just helping you on
to the next life, you know.

361
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:10,093
Yeah, man?

362
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:11,017
Marcia...

363
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,577
Can I call you back, yo?

364
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,673
I'm kinda into something.

365
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,439
Who?

366
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:20,169
In the office right now?

367
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:22,666
You want me to come down?

368
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:25,354
Over the phone.

369
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:28,043
No, man, the acoustics
would be lousy.

370
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:31,146
Yeah, yeah.
You're the boss, yeah.

371
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:34,026
Hey, grab the blue tape
now, and put it the box.

372
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:38,433
- Come on, man!
- You gotta be kidding me.

373
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,655
No, no, no.
Turn it way up. Way up!

374
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:53,995
Can you hear it?
Yeah, man.

375
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,495
<i>Follow me.</i>

376
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:02,035
Every day mortality
stares me in the face-ah

377
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:04,716
Writing in reality's
keepin' me awake now

378
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:07,325
Puttin' on the new me to work it

379
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:10,093
It's like letting go of things
no choice but to forget

380
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:12,429
Pack up my nine and
I strap it to my waist, now

381
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,275
Smoke on the reefer
to keep my head straight

382
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,190
Talk to Jah for the lyrics
now they're coming from the crowd

383
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,428
A doper M.C.
I know will never be found

384
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:23,749
Don't know what I'm watchin'
Don't know what I see

385
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:26,236
See, I know that I'm from
got to follow me

386
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:35,437
Sign him quick.
His value's about to go up.

387
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,277
I just love duct tape, don't you?

388
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,858
You're probably one of them morons
who call it "duck" tape.

389
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:46,957
Here's the situation, ganja boy.

390
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,402
You had no way of knowing -

391
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:51,099
- that I was merely an innocent
bystander to all of this.

392
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:54,571
And you "did" share your stash.

393
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:56,668
I can appreciate this.

394
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:58,051
Not to mention the fact -

395
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,397
- that I really don't want to kill you.

396
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:03,599
I don't even know what I'd
do with you once you were dead.

397
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:06,861
But I can't just let you go.

398
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:09,837
So...

399
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,879
I have a dilemma.

400
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,910
What time is it?

401
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:23,439
Fuck.

402
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,172
Just a minute.

403
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,719
- Hello.
- Mr. Wells.

404
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,713
- Dr. Jarvis, so good to see you again.
- Nice to see you, too.

405
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:19,155
Won't you come in?

406
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,043
Sorry about that.

407
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:23,922
I-I couldn't find the key to the door.

408
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,803
- I didn't hear it unlock.
- Oh, that's right.

409
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:30,675
I didn't find it.
Um, right this way.

410
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:33,923
So, Mr. Wells, you and your wife -

411
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,055
- would like to adopt the baby.

412
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:38,219
- Yes, sir. that's right.
- Okay.

413
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,663
Now, you understand the next step
in the adoption proceedings?

414
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:46,176
Um, yes. We are to be
individually evaluated.

415
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:47,971
Yes. that's right.
That's why I'm here.

416
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,381
Uh, your wife, of course, -

417
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,539
- has already completed
her evaluation.

418
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,715
She's an extraordinary woman.

419
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:55,801
Absolutely extraordinary woman.

420
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:59,443
- Um, shall we begin?
- Sure, yeah. One thing?

421
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,625
Weren't we already evaluated
at the previous screening?

422
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,806
No, that was just
the initial consultation.

423
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:07,253
This is the individual competency test.

424
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:10,004
Do you have a problem
with that, Mr. Wells?

425
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:12,853
No... not really.

426
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:15,157
Good. Then we can get started.

427
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:17,405
And what are your
qualifications, Dr. Jarvis?

428
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,805
Are you an M.D... uh...

429
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:25,106
Are you nervous, Mr. Wells?

430
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,054
No.

431
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:29,337
Why?

432
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:31,765
Because what you're
doing is this thing -

433
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,003
- called conversational transference.

434
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:35,890
Simply means that
you're trying to evade -

435
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:38,805
- answering my question,
by answering me with questions.

436
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,266
It's something that's
usually indulged in -

437
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:45,526
- by individuals who are
trying to hide something.

438
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,943
Are you trying to hide
something from me, Mr. Wells?

439
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:55,067
- No.
- Good.

440
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,711
- Do you currently use drugs?
- No.

441
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:00,359
Not even Tylenol?

442
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,839
Some... sure.

443
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,391
- Any history of drug use?
- Uh...

444
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,344
A little, I guess.

445
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:11,544
About as much as anyone
who goes to college.

446
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,286
Justification of drug use.

447
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,631
How about alcohol?

448
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,052
An occasional beer.

449
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:24,247
You ever been incarcerated
or institutionalized?

450
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:26,696
- No.
- Any history of mental illness?

451
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:27,541
No.

452
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,647
You know, there's something
about your application -

453
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,634
- that's very troubling to me.

454
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:35,081
There's a gap of two,
two and a half years.

455
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:37,936
I mean...

456
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:43,162
- It occurs, like, five years ago.
- Yeah.

457
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:46,007
Can I get you, uh, some iced tea?

458
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,965
- No. No, thank you.
- I'm a little dry.

459
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:52,201
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no. please, go. Go right ahead.

460
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,930
I asked because
your wife was very vague -

461
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:58,747
- about what you might have been doing -

462
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:00,770
- and I was hoping you might be able -

463
00:30:00,787 --> 00:30:03,289
- to shed a little bit
of light on it for me.

464
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,158
Uh... I was in L.A.

465
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,935
Yes, that's just what your wife said.

466
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,770
Could you be a little bit
more specific, though?

467
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:18,683
Oh, well...
I-I was doing some odd jobs...

468
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:21,338
- and this and that, you know?

469
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,723
No, I don't know.

470
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:26,609
Could you elaborate?

471
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:30,323
Well, I did work
as a mechanic for a while.

472
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:31,915
Oh, you mean like, for a body shop?

473
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,650
No. I mean like in a performance shop.

474
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:39,400
- Perf...
- Well, exotics and, uh, rally cars.

475
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:42,317
Oh. Uh-huh.
You know, I've changed my mind.

476
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:44,572
I think I would like some iced tea.

477
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:49,211
I'm sorry.
We're all out of iced tea.

478
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:52,123
How about a beer? Yeah...

479
00:30:58,004 --> 00:31:01,850
- You don't have anything else?
- No. No, I don't.

480
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:06,125
This is... This is just about
all that... all that I have.

481
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,605
Chris has been a little busy.

482
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:18,173
I'm-I'm sorry, Dr. Jarvis.

483
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:19,645
What-what were you saying?

484
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,935
Oh, I was just asking if you remember
the name of that performance shop.

485
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,855
Uh, Bubba's.

486
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,735
Bubba's?

487
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:35,485
Bubba's...
Big... Block... Shop.

488
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:38,334
Do you have a number for Bubba's?

489
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:46,047
No. No, they're,
uh, out of business.

490
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,735
Could you excuse me, -

491
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,061
- for just a second?

492
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,536
My cat... must have got in...

493
00:31:57,571 --> 00:31:59,421
- got into the garage, -

494
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:02,696
- and I'll be... be right back.

495
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:21,534
See these?

496
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:24,623
Got any idea what
I can do with these?

497
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:31,057
- Mm-hmm.
- Somehow, I just don't believe you.

498
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:35,137
Besides, that'd just
make a lot of noise.

499
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:03,811
Sorry about that, Dr. Jarvis.

500
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,220
- So, where were we?
- I was asking you about L.A.

501
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:21,580
Oh, yeah.

502
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,340
Wow, I apologize.
This never happens.

503
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:36,933
Can I help you?

504
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,332
May I.

505
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,141
All right... may I help you?

506
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:47,712
- So, you're Casey?
- That's right.

507
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,596
I'm a friend of Nick's.

508
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:53,701
I'll bet you are.

509
00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:54,662
May I come in?

510
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:58,547
- Nick's not here right now.
- I'll wait.

511
00:33:58,582 --> 00:34:02,542
- I'm a little busy.
- Well, I'll be real quiet.

512
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:06,467
Look, lady, I just told you.
I'm a little busy!

513
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,853
It's quite all right. I would
enjoy speaking with your friend.

514
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:12,702
She's not my friend.
I don't know who the fuck she is.

515
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:16,325
Uh, hi. I am Dallas.

516
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:19,175
No, don't bother introducing yourself,
'cause she's not staying.

517
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:22,488
What is that?

518
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:24,346
"That" is my phone.

519
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,855
Aren't you going to answer it?

520
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,043
Yeah. I'm going to answer it.

521
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:32,638
Where's your cordless?

522
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,279
You doing a survey?

523
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:38,303
I had one. I broke it.

524
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:40,885
- In anger?
- Yeah.

525
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:43,205
I mean, no.

526
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:46,219
Can you give me, uh,
just a second?

527
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:48,543
Don't sit down.

528
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,381
- Hello.
- Case.

529
00:34:58,382 --> 00:35:00,919
Nick, you get the fuck
back here right now.

530
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,633
No. I got myself
in a little trouble, Case.

531
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:06,025
You, my friend, are in a lot more
trouble than you fuckin' know.

532
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,122
- Yalie, huh? I'm a Vassar gal myself.
- Oh, really?

533
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:15,305
- What was your major?
- Poly-sci and philosophy. You mind?

534
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,857
Casey's got to be real fucked up -

535
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:32,905
- if you're making a house call.

536
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,777
I'm beginning to think so, yes.

537
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,362
Some Jamaican showed up here,
and he tried to kill me.

538
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,226
And now one of your bimbos
is sitting in my living room!

539
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:44,386
- Bimbo?
- Some bitch named Dallas.

540
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:46,952
Tell me, you're not
one of those, uh...

541
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:49,610
- Freudian sub-intellectuals
who waste all their time -

542
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:51,595
- fixating on penis envy?

543
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:53,672
Well, sex is a prime motivator.

544
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:57,912
I mean, indirectly, I believe sex -

545
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,130
- is behind most of our major
thought processes.

546
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:04,464
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

547
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,139
- Do you like pornos?
- Excuse me?

548
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,941
You know, pornos.
Fuck films.

549
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:13,708
Surely you've heard stories.

550
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:14,825
Yes. I've heard stories, -

551
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,307
- but I've never... never really
given them that much thought.

552
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:21,547
I love them, especially fag flicks.

553
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:26,092
Their big cocks sliding in
and out of each other.

554
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:30,188
Fuck, that gets me so wet they have
to steam clean the seat after I leave.

555
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,029
In fact...

556
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,196
- I'm getting wet
just talking about it.

557
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,005
- What aren't you telling me, Nick?
- Nothing, Case.

558
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:49,357
- Just don't give her my shit.
- Don't worry. I don't have it.

559
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:51,381
- You give it to the Jamaican?
- No.

560
00:36:51,616 --> 00:36:54,187
- I flushed it down the sink.
- What?

561
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:57,590
I went on as a day player
on this porn film in L.A.

562
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:59,951
Just to see what it was like, right?

563
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:04,071
So, I spent five hours with this guy
ramming his dick up my ass -

564
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,670
- and these two women licking my clit.

565
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,550
Not what you'd expect, though.
It's just acting.

566
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:12,205
I mean, at first, it was great.

567
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:16,910
Then you have some prick director that
comes over and yells "cut" in your face -

568
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:20,142
- and some queen makeup artist that
comes over every couple of minutes -

569
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:22,383
- to touch up the makeup that's
been slobbered off your tits.

570
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,903
So you don't really
have a chance to enjoy it.

571
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:28,495
Finally, I just walked off the set.

572
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:31,963
Cool experience, though.

573
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:36,432
You got a hard-on, Jarv?

574
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,330
All right...

575
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,538
Time to go.

576
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,400
Your cow is calling you.

577
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,996
- I am so sorry, Dr. Jarvis.
- Oh, no. Please, take your time.

578
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:53,252
You get the fuck out of my house.

579
00:37:57,664 --> 00:37:59,804
Did you say you were from L.A.?

580
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,390
- What?
- What?

581
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:04,017
Is that how you answer
the phone these days?

582
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:06,224
I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you were somebody else.

583
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:09,109
Did you know Mr. Wells
when he was living in L.A.?

584
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,913
Well, not directly.
Course, I heard of his work.

585
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:14,802
His work?

586
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,689
Isn't that why you're here?

587
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:23,474
What do you need?
I mean, how's your day going?

588
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:26,855
Tough. We're at
an impasse on the fee, so...

589
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,346
- That's great, honey.
- What? Casey, are you okay?

590
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:31,538
How's everything there?

591
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:35,595
Oh, it's interesting.
You really wouldn't believe it.

592
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:37,491
Have you seen Dr. Jarvis?

593
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:40,785
- Yes, and he's here right now.
- Really?

594
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,671
- How's it going?
- Huh...

595
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:47,747
And then, once I met Nick, I got
the full-blown Casey Wells story.

596
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:51,875
- You want one?
- One what?

597
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,938
A Casey Wells story.

598
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:59,090
- Yes, I would.
- How about the last one?

599
00:38:59,316 --> 00:39:01,875
- Fine.
- All right.

600
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,721
Nick and Casey -

601
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:08,597
<i>- had this guy, Jimmy.
A small-time nothing, -</i>

602
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:11,476
<i>- a bird dog for some
of the mid-level players.</i>

603
00:39:11,477 --> 00:39:15,348
It's cool, man.
You just took too big a lick.

604
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:18,149
That is some rank fuckin' shit, man.

605
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:20,949
And he set up
a meeting between them -

606
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,954
- and this big nigger
named... uh, Lester James.

607
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:26,833
<i>Of course, most people
knew him as Ballpeen.</i>

608
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:28,771
Ballpeen's casa at 7:00.

609
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:30,677
Where in the fuck a nigger
get a name like that?

610
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:33,653
- You seen little nigger's arm, right?
- Oh, yeah.

611
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:36,437
- That's why they call him Ballpeen.
- He broke Jimmy's arm...

612
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:39,282
... with a ten-pound ball peen hammer.

613
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:42,197
Three years ago
"Lester James", a.k.a. Ballpeen, -

614
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:44,083
- was a big, stud motherfucker.

615
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:46,338
Had a stable of bitches
he fucked on a regular basis, -

616
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:49,462
- but every couple weeks...
he went out to get some strange.

617
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,631
One night, Lester finds
himself in this titty bar, -

618
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,630
- and this knockout white girl named Raven,
is just gyrating her little tits off.

619
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:59,879
Well, Lester wanted her
in the worst way.

620
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:01,927
Even more when she told him
to go fuck himself.

621
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:03,734
He sprinkles
a little fairy dust on her, -

622
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,196
- somehow gets her
to go back to his place.

623
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:09,443
That was all she wrote.
He "abused" this bitch.

624
00:40:09,444 --> 00:40:12,919
He fucked her every way
you can think of and then some.

625
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,839
Finally, he gets ready
to go again, and he figures -

626
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:16,759
- he'd "really" degrade this bitch
and make her blow him.

627
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:19,639
So, he pushes her head down
and, bam!

628
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,782
She bites that
motherfucker's dick... clean off.

629
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,279
Fortunately, they found it
and sewed it back on.

630
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,012
But it never worked right again.

631
00:40:31,703 --> 00:40:35,031
The problem is, a story like that
gets around, you know how it is.

632
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,240
So to combat this, anytime he
even heard anybody talk about it, -

633
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,492
- he'd use this fuckin' hammer on them.

634
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:42,678
"Ballpeen" kind of stuck.

635
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:44,448
And Jimmy?

636
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:47,033
Over the years, this kind
of shit gets out of control.

637
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:49,152
So one day, Ballpeen,
shows up late for a meeting -

638
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:52,280
- and Jimmy made the mistake
of asking if he'd been jerking off.

639
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,713
Next thing you know,
Jimmy's got a broken arm.

640
00:40:56,314 --> 00:40:59,386
Goddamn.

641
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:02,201
Fast-forward to Ballpeen's.
Just another drug deal -

642
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:05,001
- in "La-La Land."
- Motherfuckers team make it out here?

643
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,681
Want to get this over with.

644
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:09,337
Shit makes me nervous.

645
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:25,562
What the fuck
is up with this shit?

646
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,771
You must have some pretty
bad fuckin' karma...

647
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:29,723
- feel the need
for that kind of artillery.

648
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:31,603
Don't worry, babe.
It's cool.

649
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,541
- Casey...
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, man!

650
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,428
Fuck you! You in my
motherfuckin' house!

651
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:46,009
Now, come on,
big black man.

652
00:41:46,044 --> 00:41:48,955
You know I wouldn't bring no niggas
up in here unless they was cool.

653
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:51,319
<i>Let that bad motherfucker in.</i>

654
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,284
- How's that arm, nigga?
- It's all right.

655
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:09,050
- It's still here.
- You a bad motherfucker?

656
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:13,245
I just don't let people run their hands
all over me. It shows a lack of trust.

657
00:42:13,437 --> 00:42:16,637
- May I sit down?
- Are you here to sit?

658
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,406
You tell me.

659
00:42:38,518 --> 00:42:40,138
Sit down.

660
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,739
- Shit looks good.
- Your turn.

661
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,932
Why don't you show us
the money now?

662
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:08,908
Why don't you, uh. let me
choose the next kilo to test?

663
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,376
Help yourself.

664
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,489
Derrick.

665
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:40,409
Count 'em, Jimmy.

666
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:46,752
Some more, square?

667
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:55,023
Since we're all good friends here,
I got a question for you.

668
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:56,842
Ask away.

669
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,430
It's all here, Case.

670
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,522
I heard about
this big, bad motherfucker.

671
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:08,063
He's got this habit
of hitting niggers with his hammer.

672
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,898
I've heard the reason
why he uses it -

673
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,816
- and I can sympathize.

674
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:17,956
But, uh...
there's this one thing...

675
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:21,103
- that I just... I can't
get it out of my head.

676
00:44:21,104 --> 00:44:23,523
- Go on.
- Well...

677
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:27,364
I heard about how most niggers got
these really big dicks, you know.

678
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:30,299
I mean...
just salami-sized cocks.

679
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:32,029
Well...

680
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:34,084
Now, I've had many
a different blow job, -

681
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,604
- by any number of different bitches.

682
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:38,333
So, I know how much room
even my white-boy dick -

683
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:40,771
- takes up in a bitch's mouth, right.

684
00:44:40,772 --> 00:44:43,617
My question...

685
00:44:43,652 --> 00:44:45,700
- is how the hell this little bitch, -

686
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:49,412
- got this big, nigger dick in her mouth...

687
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:52,292
- chomped it off all in one bite?

688
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,981
She could have gnawed
on it for a while, but -

689
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:57,337
- I don't think there's a
motherfucker in here let that happen.

690
00:44:57,372 --> 00:45:01,685
- Yo, we got a problem here.
- So, the only thing I can think of...

691
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,005
- is that this big,
bad ass-kickin' nigger -

692
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:07,390
- had this little "itty-bitty dick" -

693
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:09,540
- wouldn't have done
him no good, anyway.

694
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:12,385
What do you think?

695
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,073
Am I close?

696
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:18,310
I said, we got a
motherfuckin' problem here!

697
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,332
What you doing, man?
I'm fuckin' dead.

698
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,954
- Fuckin' dead.
- Why didn't you use a silencer, Casey?

699
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,198
Get the fuckin' money, Jimmy.

700
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,007
I'm fuckin' dead.
I'm fuckin' dead, man.

701
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:49,862
Why didn't you use
a silencer, Casey?

702
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:52,774
You want to go door-to-door...
tell everybody my fuckin' name?

703
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:55,620
- Oh! I'm fuckin', fuckin' dead.
- Fuckin' forgot 'em.

704
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:59,111
Good luck, man. I don't know
what the fuck is wrong with you.

705
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,895
We got 45 seconds.
Let's go.

706
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:11,464
You still here?

707
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:16,632
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

708
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:18,600
I've heard quite
enough for one day.

709
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,614
What-what?
What did you tell him?

710
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:24,689
- I don't even know this bitch.
- Well, she certainly seems to know you.

711
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:27,370
Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

712
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:29,290
Could have made
a very bad mistake.

713
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:32,244
Dr. Jarvis. Now, I-I...

714
00:46:32,245 --> 00:46:34,522
- Doctor!
- We'll be in touch, Mr. Wells.

715
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:37,897
No, now, there's been some kind
of a mistake, Dr. Jarvis.

716
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:39,817
Dr. Jarvis!

717
00:46:43,657 --> 00:46:48,457
- I'm fucked.
- Yes... you are.

718
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:06,187
Well, Case, it's just you and I.

719
00:47:06,379 --> 00:47:08,426
What do you think?

720
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,981
My wife's going to have my ass
when she finds out I let some -

721
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:15,341
- dyke in a pink rubber dress
blow off her chances -

722
00:47:15,376 --> 00:47:17,260
- for Happy Meals and diaper wipes.

723
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:20,105
It's red, asshole.

724
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,940
- Where is it?
- I'll tell you, if you answer one question.

725
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,785
Sure. Shoot.

726
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,665
Are you on the rag?

727
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,272
Because you look like
one of those women who are...

728
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:37,418
- explosive under stressful
situations, and...

729
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:42,188
Being married, you should fucking
know how much women hate that question.

730
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:45,098
But being a typical male, -

731
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,021
- you ignore your better judgment -

732
00:47:47,056 --> 00:47:49,901
- and ask anyway, huh?

733
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:53,293
I should just do your wife
a favor and blow your head off.

734
00:47:53,486 --> 00:47:56,623
It's as if every mood swing
can be written off as:

735
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:58,508
"She's just on the rag."

736
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,428
Like that explains something.

737
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:04,782
Women have mood shifts,
that "is" a fact of life.

738
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:09,102
And for your information,
I am a complete bitch, -

739
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,022
- whether I'm on the rag or not.

740
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:13,325
Hmm?

741
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:16,589
Now, let me answer your question.

742
00:48:24,495 --> 00:48:29,263
- Does that answer it?
- I'd say you're right. You're just a bitch.

743
00:48:29,298 --> 00:48:31,470
Good. Now...

744
00:48:33,104 --> 00:48:34,989
- answer my questions -

745
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:37,967
- before you start
losing appendages.

746
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:40,784
It's gone.

747
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,670
- Gone?
- Yeah.

748
00:48:42,705 --> 00:48:46,928
- What do you mean, it's gone?
- I 86'ed it.

749
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:51,582
I sent it swimming
down the sink. Bye-bye.

750
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:53,864
You're one smooth motherfucker, Casey.

751
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:58,061
You can keep the smack,
and I'll take the money -

752
00:48:58,096 --> 00:49:02,897
- and we can call it even.
- Money? What fucking money?

753
00:49:02,928 --> 00:49:05,744
It seems we're going around
in circles here. Hmm.

754
00:49:06,705 --> 00:49:09,872
I want the two mil, Casey.

755
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:13,384
- Let me...
- Let me explain something to you.

756
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:17,648
I am not a drug dealer.
It's been four years, -

757
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:20,145
- since I've even seen any drugs.

758
00:49:20,146 --> 00:49:22,331
I'm an architect.

759
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:26,832
I am a happy little Republican, -

760
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,752
- who spends the majority of his time, -

761
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:30,707
- trying to figure out how
to pay the fucking bills -

762
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,618
- and make his wife happy.

763
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:37,459
I got to tell you, Casey,
I'm not impressed.

764
00:49:37,494 --> 00:49:39,343
After everything I heard about you, -

765
00:49:39,378 --> 00:49:42,226
- I thought you were
gonna be more like... me.

766
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:46,066
But you are a sheep,
like all the rest.

767
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:49,252
There will come a time...

768
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,883
- when even you,
can't handle it anymore.

769
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:56,467
You'll pack it up
or you'll put a bullet -

770
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:58,599
- in that pretty little head of yours.

771
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,427
Or someone else will.

772
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:04,613
You are a pussy, Casey.

773
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:07,515
Nick wouldn't admit it,
but it's true.

774
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,783
You just couldn't
handle it, could you?

775
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:13,940
Nick ever tell you
about that last time?

776
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:16,191
- Sure.
- Ballpeen's apartment?

777
00:50:16,248 --> 00:50:19,700
- Uh-huh.
- Did he tell you about the girl?

778
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:25,252
- What's up?
- Why didn't you use the silencer, Casey?

779
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:26,807
Get the fucking money.

780
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,828
- Why didn't you use a silencer?
- You wanna go door to door -

781
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:33,909
- and tell everybody,
in the building my fuckin' name?

782
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:37,849
- I forgot 'em, all right?
- I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.

783
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,981
Get the fuckin' money, Jimmy,
and let's get the fuck out.

784
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:43,669
We got 45 seconds.
Let's go.

785
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:10,551
- What?
- Jesus.

786
00:51:10,743 --> 00:51:13,730
She's seven, maybe eight
months, pregnant, Nick.

787
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,542
Fuck me.

788
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,631
Come on, Casey, we got to go.

789
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:20,382
She's dead, Casey.

790
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:21,871
Dead, just like we're going to be -

791
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:23,422
- if we don't move our asses.

792
00:51:23,723 --> 00:51:27,251
We got to go.
Snap out of it, man!

793
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:35,843
It's clear. We got to jump. That bitch
was gonna kill you, man. Let it go.

794
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:41,673
- What about Jimmy? Is he...
- He's meat loaf, bro.

795
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:46,073
This is it, Nick.

796
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:47,993
No more.

797
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,853
That was it.

798
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:05,693
Oh, that was a real
touching story, Case.

799
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:11,656
Remind me to submit it to
"Reader's Digest" after you're gone.

800
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,233
So it looks like we're
going to have to wait for Nick.

801
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:18,778
What should we do
to kill some time?

802
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:21,133
I know.

803
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:26,760
- Let's fuck.
- That's happening.

804
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,235
Even if you weren't the most
disgusting bitch I'd ever met, -

805
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:34,040
- I'd have to decline.
You see, I'm a married man.

806
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:37,555
You seem to be under the impression
that you have a choice here.

807
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:53,307
Ah, let's see.

808
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:06,908
You'll appreciate the irony here.

809
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,957
She wanted to watch.

810
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,406
Fuck you, bitch.

811
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:40,617
There's no fucking way,
you'll ever get me inside you.

812
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:46,378
You wanna' bet?

813
00:54:08,226 --> 00:54:10,303
Well, look at that.

814
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:12,512
Have you done this before?

815
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:18,755
Don't worry.

816
00:55:19,043 --> 00:55:21,986
I'm not going to kill
you till you come.

817
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:25,230
I'll let you betray
your wife thoroughly.

818
00:55:26,915 --> 00:55:30,795
Maybe if we get lucky,
I'll get pregnant.

819
00:55:57,635 --> 00:56:00,355
Oh...

820
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:07,173
That was one.

821
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:10,085
Don't worry.
I'm multiorgasmic.

822
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:15,810
<i>- Got it, honey?
- Yeah, hold on.</i>

823
00:56:15,845 --> 00:56:17,730
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Okay, it's flashing.

824
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:21,605
Okay, here we go. Here we go!
Whoo! Okay, here we go! Whoo!

825
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,486
I love you.

826
00:56:26,406 --> 00:56:28,369
I love you, too.

827
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:43,057
Number two.

828
00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:48,059
Great self-control.

829
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:20,166
Goddamn, did you see the way
that bitch head explode? Shit!

830
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:24,408
Ordinarily, it would be a damn shame
to shoot a piece of ass like that.

831
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:28,149
You know what I mean? But in
her case, I'll make an exception.

832
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:31,433
I always hated that bitch.
My name's Billy Hill.

833
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,908
My friend's call me Hill-Billy.
You can call me Mr. Hill.

834
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,629
I hope I didn't interrupt
anything too romantic for you, -

835
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,913
- but that whore could go all day long.

836
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:40,757
Besides, I was getting tired
sitting down in the cab of my truck.

837
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:42,514
She lost me on the freeway.

838
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:45,094
Let me give you a little
friendly piece of advice.

839
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:48,441
I know you're retired. You got
this family thing going here.

840
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:51,293
But you really ought to have
your name and number unlisted.

841
00:57:51,294 --> 00:57:52,970
Information girl
give me your address.

842
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:56,394
Your fucking address, man.
That don't sound too smart.

843
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:58,539
- What are you looking for?
- Tequila.

844
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:03,370
- To your right.
- Mm.

845
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,250
The good stuff.

846
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,090
Fancy.

847
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:13,762
You got any limes?
No? Just as well.

848
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:21,351
Oh! Yeah! Damn!

849
00:58:21,352 --> 00:58:22,947
It always tastes like old feet to me.

850
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:24,931
That shit'll fuck you up,
though. Mm.

851
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:27,883
You ever hear how it's made?

852
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:35,539
A bunch of Mexicans... sitting
around this big wooden vat -

853
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:37,900
- chewing on agave, right?

854
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:41,796
They do this days and days
spitting into this giant vat.

855
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,852
Then when it's full, -

856
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:46,572
- then they leave that there
to ferment.

857
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,492
When it's ready, -

858
00:58:48,588 --> 00:58:50,940
- they scoop off the top layer.

859
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:53,372
That's mescal.
Nasty, huh?

860
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:55,853
No wonder that shit tastes so bad.

861
00:58:55,888 --> 00:58:58,093
Well, I ain't going to shit you, pal.

862
00:58:58,128 --> 00:58:59,979
When I leave here today, -

863
00:59:00,014 --> 00:59:02,974
- you're going be dead
as Cinderella over there.

864
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,924
Regardless of what you tell me, -

865
00:59:07,149 --> 00:59:09,732
- I'm gonna fuck you up.

866
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:15,981
Ready to get started?

867
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:21,098
I know you threw out the smack.

868
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:24,574
And you probably don't know
where the money is, neither.

869
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:26,631
That's cool.

870
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:30,579
The truth is...

871
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:34,539
I ain't got nothing better to do...

872
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,574
- while I wait here
for my old friend, Nick.

873
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:40,815
Just so you know, I ain't
going to let you bleed to death.

874
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:44,455
No, sir.
'Cause when I cut you...

875
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:47,791
- I'm going to cauterize you.

876
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,727
I consider myself an artist.
Matter of fact, -

877
00:59:51,887 --> 00:59:54,767
- I picked up this little girl
at this club one time, -

878
00:59:54,768 --> 00:59:57,580
- and I cut on her for 16 hours.

879
00:59:57,615 --> 01:00:02,015
That's a personal best.
But I keep hopin'.

880
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:06,061
You know, in a way, -

881
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:08,624
- it's really Nick that's
to blame for all this.

882
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:10,792
If he hadn't tried
to double-cross me and Dallas, -

883
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:12,581
- I wouldn't be here.

884
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:14,781
All right. Now, let's see.

885
01:00:15,856 --> 01:00:18,824
I think I'm going to start
at the feet and work my way up!

886
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,890
What the hell?

887
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:43,057
<i>Open the door. Police!
Open the fucking door, Will!</i>

888
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:45,862
<i>There's no Will here! Go away!</i>

889
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:49,697
Stupid son of a bitches.
They got the wrong house.

890
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:51,538
<i>Go away!</i>

891
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,418
<i>Everybody on the ground!</i>

892
01:00:54,453 --> 01:00:57,138
Don't go nowhere.

893
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,971
<i>Where's the money, motherfucker?</i>

894
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:11,939
<i>Where's the money?</i>

895
01:01:14,324 --> 01:01:18,259
<i>I mean, there's no money in here!</i>

896
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,140
<i>Shut up, bitch!</i>

897
01:01:27,859 --> 01:01:30,064
There's a .45 in the fridge -

898
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:33,019
- and you grab a fucking frying pan.

899
01:01:33,654 --> 01:01:37,100
I must have some
really bad karma.

900
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:42,338
Stupid cops.

901
01:01:42,373 --> 01:01:44,133
They busted up the wrong house.

902
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:46,413
They went in,
blew everyone away!

903
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:47,996
The wrong house!

904
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:50,900
They got the Wong house.

905
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:53,661
They got the "Wong" house.

906
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:57,534
Shit, man. Lighten up.

907
01:01:57,569 --> 01:02:00,286
Where the hell was I?

908
01:02:01,854 --> 01:02:05,781
Yeah. I think I was, uh...

909
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,807
This piece of shit
was going to cut you up.

910
01:02:34,823 --> 01:02:36,703
Now you fucking do it.

911
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:38,800
Do it!

912
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:41,224
Fuck!

913
01:02:49,985 --> 01:02:51,960
Dallas was right.

914
01:03:07,257 --> 01:03:08,670
Hello.

915
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:11,464
- Hey, Case.
- Nick!

916
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:13,430
Man, it's good
to hear from you!

917
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:15,672
Goddamn.
I just wanted to tell you -

918
01:03:15,897 --> 01:03:18,230
- how much I enjoyed your visit.
- I know you're pissed.

919
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:21,145
Pissed? Oh, no, I'm not pissed.
If you hadn't brought your friends along -

920
01:03:21,146 --> 01:03:23,129
- what would I have done
with my day, man?

921
01:03:23,418 --> 01:03:27,867
I'd a missed out on being beaten and
raped, abused, tied up, generally fucked up.

922
01:03:27,902 --> 01:03:31,099
- Casey...
- Not to mention what you done for my house.

923
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:33,987
What would you call it?
Early-Gothic horror.

924
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:36,057
I don't have time for this shit.

925
01:03:36,347 --> 01:03:38,138
I'm dead.

926
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,051
Unless I make this next plane,
you can write me off.

927
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,219
- There's still a chance for you.
- Where's the money, Nick?

928
01:03:44,315 --> 01:03:48,027
That's why I'm calling you.
I stole it from the cops, -

929
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:50,444
- and they ain't real happy about it.

930
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:52,613
They're going to be coming after you.

931
01:03:52,648 --> 01:03:54,747
They already hit
the house next door.

932
01:03:54,782 --> 01:03:56,632
It's only a matter of time.

933
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,547
- What about the fucks you stole the shit from?
- Oh, they're dead.

934
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:03,003
Unfortunately, the niggers
who they work for ain't.

935
01:04:03,038 --> 01:04:05,507
They're going to find you too,
sooner or later.

936
01:04:06,068 --> 01:04:09,069
Come on, man.
Where's the money?

937
01:04:09,624 --> 01:04:11,629
I hid it.

938
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,945
I want you to get out
of town for a while.

939
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,339
Take a vacation...
A second honeymoon. Something.

940
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:20,700
One day when you're sitting
on a beach sipping a cold one, -

941
01:04:20,701 --> 01:04:24,060
- spare tire around your waist,
think about me, bro.

942
01:04:24,316 --> 01:04:27,780
- Where you going, Nick?
- Can't tell you.

943
01:04:27,812 --> 01:04:31,229
Your car's at I.A.H.
in short-term parking.

944
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:35,164
There's a flight leaving
for Paris tonight at 8:05.

945
01:04:35,389 --> 01:04:37,949
If I were you,
I would be on it.

946
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:42,749
- I got to go.
- Hey, Nick, you really getting married, man?

947
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,196
No, man.

948
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:49,469
Not my style.

949
01:04:59,102 --> 01:05:01,022
Nick?

950
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,358
I love you, Case.

951
01:05:06,911 --> 01:05:09,796
I'm sorry about the shit.

952
01:05:10,591 --> 01:05:13,471
Maybe one day
I'll make it up to you.

953
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:17,312
I got to go.

954
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:25,951
Adios.

955
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:28,887
Nick...

956
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:33,918
Nick?

957
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:00,490
Oh, fuck.

958
01:07:12,357 --> 01:07:13,964
Just a minute.

959
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,685
Oh, shit, that's cold.

960
01:07:37,478 --> 01:07:39,398
Mr. Wells.

961
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:44,197
Detective Kasarov.
May I come in?

962
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:45,958
Sure.

963
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:52,839
This is a nice place you got here.

964
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:54,759
I like the mailbox... cute.

965
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:56,644
My wife's idea.

966
01:07:56,679 --> 01:07:59,559
I'll have to drive
my wife by sometime... She'd...

967
01:07:59,594 --> 01:08:01,479
She'd love it.

968
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,655
- Feel better now?
- Tons.

969
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,605
Keep yours.
It's a gesture.

970
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,640
- Mind if I get something to drink?
- No, no. Help yourself.

971
01:08:26,675 --> 01:08:29,319
Casey, why don't you
take a peek in that bag?

972
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,240
I got a little
something for you.

973
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:41,608
Soy milk.
I just love soy milk.

974
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:44,928
You know, one of my kids
is lactose-intolerant.

975
01:08:44,977 --> 01:08:47,249
So I ended up getting
hooked on the shit.

976
01:08:47,264 --> 01:08:48,880
Couldn't get enough of it.

977
01:08:49,857 --> 01:08:53,321
I don't get too much anymore.
Mmm.

978
01:08:55,241 --> 01:08:57,162
Ahh!

979
01:08:58,658 --> 01:09:01,887
Well... Why don't we...

980
01:09:01,922 --> 01:09:05,122
- handle our business like
a couple of grown-ups.

981
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:07,722
I mean, Casey, you know
I didn't pop over here -

982
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,642
- for some social visit.

983
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,834
Your friend, Nicky,
stole a lot of money from us.

984
01:09:15,274 --> 01:09:17,641
Killed a few officers,
in the process.

985
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:20,578
Deaths we can overlook.

986
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,378
Okay?

987
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:24,999
But we want our money back.

988
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:27,714
Like I've been telling everybody
come through here...

989
01:09:27,755 --> 01:09:30,723
I realize you don't have it,
but you know where it is.

990
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:36,763
Somewhere in the deepest
recesses of your brain, -

991
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,443
- you know.

992
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:43,244
You can't tell me after all the time
you spent with Nicky, -

993
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,164
- you don't know,
how his mind worked.

994
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:47,388
You just figure it out.

995
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:50,404
I'm telling you...

996
01:09:50,445 --> 01:09:53,804
I know how much you're
doing to clean up your act.

997
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,684
And I venture to guess that...

998
01:09:56,876 --> 01:10:00,604
- that your good-looking wife
doesn't even know about your past.

999
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:02,660
Right?

1000
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:06,316
Tell you what, Casey,
I want to make you a deal.

1001
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:11,436
You have that money
here tonight at 7:00...

1002
01:10:11,725 --> 01:10:14,325
- and I'll make this fuckin'
nightmare disappear.

1003
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:20,325
- Where do you got the bodies?
- In the garage.

1004
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,205
Let's go.

1005
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:27,589
What the fuck is this?

1006
01:10:27,655 --> 01:10:30,286
I didn't know
what to do with them.

1007
01:10:35,286 --> 01:10:37,886
Well, I'll tell you something, Casey,
If I was you, -

1008
01:10:37,926 --> 01:10:41,262
- I'd clean up this mess,
because your wife's going -

1009
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,878
- to come home and she's
not going to be very happy.

1010
01:10:43,918 --> 01:10:45,683
Any suggestions?

1011
01:10:45,718 --> 01:10:49,487
Well, I'll tell you,
if I'm not mistaken...

1012
01:10:49,488 --> 01:10:52,367
I think today's garbage day.

1013
01:11:01,839 --> 01:11:03,614
7:00.

1014
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,207
Sharp.

1015
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:10,208
And if I don't find it?

1016
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,776
Casey, I'd try real hard.

1017
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:20,400
How do I know all of this
is going to disappear?

1018
01:11:20,616 --> 01:11:23,023
Don't be late.

1019
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:28,786
<i>One day, when you're sitting
on a beach sipping a cold one, -</i>

1020
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,515
<i>- a spare tire around your waist, -</i>

1021
01:12:30,676 --> 01:12:34,163
<i>- think about me, bro.</i>

1022
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:55,252
You're good, Nick.

1023
01:12:55,253 --> 01:12:58,741
You're very, very good.

1024
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:19,421
"Sorry I missed it. Nick."

1025
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:29,519
Whew.

1026
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:44,088
<i>Never forget who you are, man.
You do, you die.</i>

1027
01:13:44,216 --> 01:13:45,744
<i>Love, Nick.</i>

1028
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:19,701
Who the fuck's this?

1029
01:14:19,736 --> 01:14:22,616
This is the motherfucker
who killed the ganja man.

1030
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,737
I got your shit, motherfucker.

1031
01:14:27,602 --> 01:14:29,913
Yeah? Then if you do, -

1032
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,545
- you have one mil at my "Casa" at 7:00, -

1033
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,745
- 'cause I'm auctioning the shit off.

1034
01:14:35,002 --> 01:14:37,330
My name is Casey Wells.

1035
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:39,777
You can't find me,
you don't get to bid.

1036
01:14:39,818 --> 01:14:42,626
7:00. Don't be late.

1037
01:15:12,444 --> 01:15:14,692
Looks like it's just
you and me, partner.

1038
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,860
<i>All right, Casey. Time's up.</i>

1039
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,083
<i>He's in the kitchen!</i>

1040
01:16:45,504 --> 01:16:47,584
Casey, what are you doing here?

1041
01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:49,469
Can I speak with you a minute?

1042
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:52,384
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Casey.

1043
01:16:54,304 --> 01:16:58,016
- Casey, you remember Allen?
- Hey, Allen, excuse us.

1044
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:02,977
God, of all the times
you decide to spaz out.

1045
01:17:02,978 --> 01:17:06,098
- Whose car?
- It was Nick's. I'm borrowing it.

1046
01:17:06,133 --> 01:17:07,982
It's not important.
Here's the deal.

1047
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:11,057
I'm going to France.
My plane leaves in one hour.

1048
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:13,629
I miss it, I won't be going anywhere.

1049
01:17:13,664 --> 01:17:16,104
What? Your little friend's
gotten you in trouble, hasn't he?

1050
01:17:17,144 --> 01:17:18,544
God.

1051
01:17:20,945 --> 01:17:22,921
What, are you just going
to go with or without me?

1052
01:17:22,985 --> 01:17:26,498
I got no choice.
Line in the sand, Chris.

1053
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:28,865
For better or for worse.

1054
01:17:28,866 --> 01:17:31,266
That's your decision.

1055
01:17:33,763 --> 01:17:35,778
I love you.

1056
01:17:37,506 --> 01:17:39,746
You're asking me
to throw away my life.

1057
01:17:39,818 --> 01:17:42,258
This has got its own reward.
Now, I got to know.

1058
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:45,586
You in or you out?

1059
01:17:49,987 --> 01:17:52,227
Time's up. I got to go.

1060
01:17:52,299 --> 01:17:54,785
Casey, wait.

1061
01:17:58,626 --> 01:18:01,058
Last chance.

1062
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:06,475
- I won't lose you, Casey.
- Good choice, Chris.

1063
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,660
Let's see what's behind
door number one.

1064
01:18:12,068 --> 01:18:13,988
Oh, my God.

1065
01:18:14,212 --> 01:18:15,907
How much?

1066
01:18:15,908 --> 01:18:17,825
Two million dollars.

1067
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:22,660
- I guess we won't be too miserable.
- Did you rob a bank?

1068
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:26,741
No, I'll tell you all about it...
everything.

1069
01:18:26,816 --> 01:18:28,708
We got to catch that plane!

1070
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,653
Oh, my God...

1071
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:34,525
Sorry, Allen, I have to miss
that dinner tomorrow night.

1072
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:36,429
Looks like I'll be out of town.

1073
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,806
So, how was your day?

1074
01:18:54,841 --> 01:18:56,591
I closed the account.

1075
01:18:57,506 --> 01:19:00,067
I'm really happy for you.

1076
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,957
Oh, I didn't know you cared.

1077
01:19:02,246 --> 01:19:03,942
Sweetheart...

1078
01:19:03,943 --> 01:19:07,751
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.
