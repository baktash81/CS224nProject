1
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,819
What is that?

2
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,698
It's that famous picture
of the monster.

3
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,194
But it's fake.

4
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,870
How do you know it's fake?
It looks real.

5
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:48,504
Oh, it's fake all right.

6
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,106
Of course it's fake,
everyone knows that.

7
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,677
Wait now, son. There's more
to that photo than meets the eye.

8
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,449
-Oh, really?
-If you'd like to know the real truth....

9
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,346
Yeah. I wanna know.

10
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:04,112
-Come on. It'll be fun.
-Come on.

11
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:09,522
Well, you have to go back
to World War ll.

12
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,262
The Germans had captured
the rest of Europe...

13
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:18,459
...and were only a hundred miles or so
from these shores.

14
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:21,932
And you need to know
about a young lad...

15
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,668
...called Angus MacMorrow.

16
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:30,072
The wee lad was drawn to water...

17
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:34,651
...but deathly afraid of it
at the same time.

18
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,465
You know something, Angus?

19
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,232
The tide pool
is a very strange, enchanted place.

20
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,344
See these wee beauties?

21
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:46,579
Now, they are full of luck and magic.

22
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,514
-No!
-Aye, Angus.

23
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:52,350
-You best believe it.
-Can I keep it, Daddy?

24
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:56,190
Aye. But don't tell your Mummy.

25
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:59,193
She believes things
should stay where they are.

26
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,444
Angus.

27
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,590
Angus.

28
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,422
Angus MacMorrow,
what in heaven's name?

29
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:38,967
-Sorry. I'm coming.
-Indeed you are.

30
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,440
I thought you'd drowned.

31
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,345
You didn't even get wet.

32
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:09,327
That piece. Please.

33
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,494
-Thank you.
-Cheerio.

34
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,742
See you, Archie.

35
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,548
I'd say it's going to rain,
Mrs. MacMorrow.

36
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,344
Think you might be right,
Mr. McCowan.

37
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:36,220
Would you remind me to tell Clyde
to move the cattle to the lower field?

38
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,381
I'll just put my pail in the workshop.

39
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:02,144
Well, be quick.
You have to help with the tea.

40
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,656
-Clyde.
-Aye.

41
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,351
Can we move the cattle
down to the lower field?

42
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,657
Oh, aye.
I have got nothing better to do.

43
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,767
Mummy. Look what I've got.

44
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:23,096
-Where'd you get that?
-Every volunteer got four oranges.

45
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,708
I haven't had an orange
in Lord knows how long.

46
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,277
How was the shore?
Did Angus have fun?

47
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,947
Angus, fun?

48
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,470
Angus! Come on in now.

49
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,148
You told me you'd help with the tea.

50
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,030
All the Malay Peninsula
has been overrun.

51
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:04,258
We are struggling hard
in the Libyan Desert...

52
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:08,667
...where perhaps another
serious battle will be soon fought.

53
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:11,433
The whole future of mankind...

54
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:15,010
...may depend upon our actions
and upon our conduct.

55
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:20,048
So far we have not failed.
We shall not fail now.

56
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:24,187
Let us move forward
steadfastly together....

57
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,217
Jings.

58
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:29,434
It's all right. There, there.

59
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,667
Here you go. Come on.

60
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,403
That's it.

61
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:20,123
Come on. Come on.

62
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,995
That's it.

63
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,792
All right, then.

64
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,495
That's a good boy.

65
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,102
It's all right.

66
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,017
Oh, no.

67
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,874
There you are.

68
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,543
It's all right. I'll take care of you.

69
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:25,077
Angus.

70
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,324
Angus? Angus, it's bedtime.

71
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:33,019
How many times
do I have to call you?

72
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,344
Crikey.

73
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,588
Get a move on!

74
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,298
What is it?

75
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,906
Maybe Daddy's with them.

76
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,012
Pull up, lads.

77
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:34,489
-Do you know anything about this?
-No.

78
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:38,195
-They've got to be here for a reason.
-I don't know.

79
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,331
Excuse me, sir.

80
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,266
Good morning, madam.

81
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:52,534
Captain Thomas Hamilton,
12 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery.

82
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:53,768
Are we all set?

83
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:58,644
The housekeeper, Mrs. MacMorrow,
is making all the arrangements.

84
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,909
-She is?
-Yes. Is she around?

85
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,450
I'm Anne MacMorrow.

86
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,745
Oh, I beg your pardon.

87
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:09,188
Clearly, HQ have failed to notify you.
My troop is to be billeted here.

88
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,157
What with?

89
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,227
I've hardly any staff.

90
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:16,923
When Lord Killin went off to the RAF,
only a few of us stayed on here.

91
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,365
Well, we won't expect afternoon tea.

92
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,471
No, only the officers
will be billeted inside the house.

93
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:25,369
The rest of my men
will camp outside.

94
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:29,469
Well, I'm afraid I really would need
Lord Killin's permission.

95
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,669
Of course.

96
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,873
-Wormsley?
-Yes, sir.

97
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:39,448
From Lord Killin. We're friends,
actually. At Oxford the same year.

98
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,382
All right.

99
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:46,029
But I have to tell you, our cupboards
are not exactly full these days.

100
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,290
Not to worry. The War Office
keeps us well-supplied.

101
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,867
And what's more, we have a number
of keen hunters in our regiment.

102
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,665
They are trained killers, after all.

103
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:03,373
You see, Scotland is the front line
in the war these days.

104
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:05,482
-Sir.
-Good man.

105
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:08,151
Nazi submarines are everywhere.

106
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:09,819
Here we are.

107
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:13,047
Splendid. Yes.

108
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,250
Well, how lovely.

109
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,689
Now all this, you see,
is for your own protection.

110
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,832
-Goldman?
-Well, we're very grateful.

111
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,264
Is this the German advance?

112
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,030
Following the troop movements,
are you?

113
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:34,238
Don't you worry, son.
We're ready for them.

114
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,815
-Now, you men, come with me.
-Sir.

115
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:41,348
Can you put my desk over here?

116
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,382
Kirstie, Angus, run along.

117
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:48,184
We don't want to distract our guests
from their duties.

118
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,225
Can you keep a secret?

119
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,864
Isn't this exciting?
Soldiers right here in our home.

120
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,296
-Promise me you can keep a secret.
-What are you babbling about?

121
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:01,802
-You have to swear not to tell Mummy.
-I'll not breathe a word. What is it?

122
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,163
I don't know.

123
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:40,409
Hey! Those are my daddy's boots.
Let go.

124
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,408
Bad boy. You can't eat them.

125
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,747
But I suppose you are hungry.

126
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,459
What's that? Churchill.

127
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,193
That's enough, Churchill.

128
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,497
-Who are you?
-Sergeant Wallace Strunk.

129
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:12,142
Twelve Medium Regiment, Royal
Artillery. First battery cook.

130
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,970
Churchill, regiment mascot.

131
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:19,906
-Unauthorized personnel.
-I just wanted a wee snack.

132
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,745
Provisions dispensed
only by written orders in triplicate.

133
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:24,751
Do you have the paperwork?

134
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,081
Then off you go.

135
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,728
Who's Daddy's boy, then, eh?
Good boy. Good Churchill.

136
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,391
-You're still here?
-I take out the rubbish.

137
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,861
On the double, then.

138
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:41,427
Who's the best little soldier in the
regiment, then? It's my Churchill.

139
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,972
Good boy. Give me a kiss.
Give me another kiss.

140
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:57,184
Hello?

141
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,379
Where are you, boy?

142
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:05,853
Where are you hiding?

143
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:16,068
You are a sneaky devil,
aren't you, boy?

144
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,739
If you are a boy.

145
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,267
What can we call you?

146
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:34,549
Crusoe. Trapped on an island.

147
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:38,656
Right, then, Crusoe.
Let's see what you are.

148
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,766
No.

149
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,474
No.

150
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:06,646
There you are.

151
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:12,920
Maybe you're a mammal.

152
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,531
Where were you born, Daddy?

153
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,336
I was born and brought up
on the banks of Loch Morar.

154
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:32,579
People whispered about a beastie
living in that very loch.

155
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:37,320
Now, always there've been tales
of sightings of such a creature...

156
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:41,890
...sometimes at sea,
but more often in a loch.

157
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:44,793
When I was a boy...

158
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:48,025
...how I longed to see that monster.

159
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,868
When I was a boy...

160
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,468
...terrible times they were.

161
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,665
Boys and girls, wives and mothers
all over the world...

162
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,844
...left without the man of the house.

163
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:07,748
They all went off to war,
and many never came back.

164
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:11,883
We're a tiny village
in the wilds of Scotland...

165
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,785
...but 20 men we lost.

166
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,285
But maybe I'm boring you
with my story.

167
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,493
No. No, please. Don't stop.

168
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,297
Okay, if you insist.

169
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:27,093
Angus was just like
every other wee boy.

170
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:30,137
He wanted his daddy home again.

171
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:35,503
But he also had another problem.

172
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:41,044
Crusoe, you ate it all.
Come out. You'll be sick.

173
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:54,824
That's a good boy.
I'm sorry for grabbing.

174
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,865
You're all dried up.

175
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:15,908
You'll like this.

176
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:21,886
That's better, eh?

177
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,625
-Look at that.
-Oh, yeah.

178
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,893
Go in there.
Oh, another five-pounder.

179
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:33,660
Oh, you beauty.

180
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:36,635
-Aye.
-That takes care of my lunch.

181
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:52,784
What are they doing
up on that hill?

182
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,452
It's a secret mission.
They're after submarines.

183
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,458
Well, if it's secret,
how do you know about it?

184
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:02,029
-I have my ways, my contacts.
-Aye.

185
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:06,226
Well, make contact with them oars.
Pull us over some more fish.

186
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:20,709
Right. Salute.

187
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:23,720
Down.

188
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,684
Map, sir?

189
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:35,657
-Perfect.
-It's an amazing view, sir.

190
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:41,535
HMS Royal Oak was lost
to a German U-boat in Scapa Flow...

191
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:43,764
...not a hundred miles from this spot.

192
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,976
Eight hundred and thirty-three
sailors lost.

193
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:50,905
We're not here for the scenery,
Wormsley.

194
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,639
Yes, sir.

195
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:56,712
Now, make no mistake...

196
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:59,812
...we are on the front line here.

197
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:04,153
Now, I have studied
the German advance.

198
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:08,330
If they invade,
they will come right through here.

199
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:12,198
This is the deepest loch in Scotland,
perfect for their troopships.

200
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:15,270
But they will send submarines first
for reconnaissance.

201
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:17,565
Won't the steel net stop them, sir?

202
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:20,232
The submarine net will be down...

203
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:24,142
...to permit passage
by routine marine traffic...

204
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:26,680
...and to let their subs in.

205
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:30,453
And then we will raise the net...

206
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,949
...and we will destroy them.

207
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:46,399
I wish I could swim like you.
I wish I wasn't so afraid.

208
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,868
Come on! Stop!

209
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,669
What the hell
you think you're doing?

210
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:56,174
-What's going on?
-Keep your hands off!

211
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,779
You're not fit to touch it.

212
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:59,472
Oh, no.

213
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:02,618
I better go. Stay out of trouble.

214
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,121
Look where you're going.

215
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:12,659
Where'd you learn to drive,
in the Dodgems?

216
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,923
Look, there's a rear-vision mirror.
Know what that's for?

217
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,534
-That's to look where you're going.
-It was an accident, I assure you.

218
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,864
All right, Clyde. That's enough.

219
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:23,733
That's a lovely bit of meat there.

220
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:26,938
Who's this?

221
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,945
There he goes.

222
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,556
Did you see all those jeeps and
lorries going up and down the hill?

223
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,756
You're late.

224
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,799
And that is very hush-hush.

225
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:56,769
Aye. It's a secret mission,
that's what I hear. Top secret.

226
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,134
I'll say one thing, Jimmy.

227
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:01,675
If it's a secret, you'd be
the last person to tell about it.

228
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,473
-That's cruel. That's very cruel.
-Aye.

229
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,413
-Evening.
-All right.

230
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:14,022
-What'll you have?
-Pint of McEwan's.

231
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:24,694
Looks like rain.

232
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,197
Yeah, it might.

233
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:31,374
You're not from the village.
Would you be with the artillery?

234
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:35,712
Here we are, lads.
Our home away from home.

235
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:39,910
Did you hear the captain today?
"We're on the front lines."

236
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:41,311
Front line, my aunt.

237
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:44,419
We're here because his daddy
put him as far away from danger...

238
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:46,521
...as the War Office could find.

239
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,851
You're the boys
with the big gun up the loch.

240
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,517
-Indeed we are.
-Would that thing sink a submarine?

241
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,664
With one shell.

242
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:57,494
-What are you having, lads?
-Pint of heavy.

243
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,101
Yeah, I'll have a whiskey.
What you got there?

244
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,538
Recock, fire.

245
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,644
Recock, fire.

246
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,679
Recock, fire.

247
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:38,065
Angus, we need to talk.

248
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,138
Mrs. MacMorrow?

249
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:48,571
-Who are you?
-Me name's Lewis Mowbray.

250
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:51,606
Oh, yes. The handyman.

251
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,644
You're two days late in arriving.

252
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,649
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,221
I....

254
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:04,658
I was.... I....

255
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,256
Well, you can start
by cleaning this mess.

256
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:13,562
You can pack up
all these books and shells...

257
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,534
...and charts and so forth.

258
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:20,933
I want to empty this shop out.
And...

259
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,772
...I think my son has an animal
hidden in here somewhere.

260
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,881
He's not allowed pets, so....

261
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,644
-Do you think you could manage that?
-Aye.

262
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:34,720
And we'll have no drinking
in our house, Mr. Lewis.

263
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:38,553
Yes, ma'am. That's--

264
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:41,060
That's Mowbray, ma'am.

265
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,557
Yes.

266
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,882
Oh, no.

267
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:07,848
No! No, no! No!

268
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:11,516
What are you doing?
Why did you empty the barrel?

269
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:16,722
-Did you see anything fall out of it?
-Only water. What are you looking for?

270
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,827
Nothing.
You'd remember if you'd seen it.

271
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,028
I didn't see anything.

272
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,097
Who are you?

273
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,833
Mrs. MacMorrow hired me
to help her in the lodge.

274
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,773
So this'll be my workshop now.

275
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,379
I don't want you coming in
and out of it. Understand?

276
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:35,039
This is my father's workshop.
He's off fighting in the war.

277
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:36,879
-You can't just come in here--
-Lad!

278
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,882
When your father returns,
he can do with it what he wants.

279
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,183
But for now, this shop is mine...

280
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:44,553
...and I want to be left alone.
Am I clear?

281
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:47,560
Have I made myself clear?

282
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:02,338
Crusoe?

283
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:04,741
Crusoe, come out.

284
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,109
Where are you hiding?

285
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,879
Could I trouble you for a light?

286
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:15,724
Thank you.

287
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,224
Absolutely stunning countryside,
isn't it?

288
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:26,563
You from around here?

289
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:28,933
I'm from Dornoch.

290
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,469
Captain Thomas Hamilton.

291
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:33,934
Good to meet you.

292
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,437
And yours?

293
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,949
Mowbray. Lewis Mowbray.

294
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:48,416
And you've seen service, I presume.

295
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:51,788
Crusoe, please come out.

296
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,929
Come out now.

297
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,398
Well, have a good evening,
Mowbray.

298
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,306
Where are you?
Where have you gone?

299
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,680
Crusoe, where the devil are you?

300
00:35:21,818 --> 00:35:24,013
Sergeant Strunk!

301
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,956
Bad dog, Churchill.

302
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,493
Don't care if you're Lord Chamberlain,
I won't have my kitchen destroyed.

303
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:37,224
Sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what got into him.

304
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:07,461
Hush your wheesht, you daft dog!

305
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,937
Crusoe, no!

306
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,483
-Stop. Get back in there.
-No. No, it's horrible.

307
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:30,448
-He won't hurt you. Believe me.
-It's disgusting.

308
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:32,519
-He won't hurt you.
-What is it?

309
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:36,916
I don't know, but it came from an egg.
I tried to tell you.

310
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:43,693
Jings, Crusoe.

311
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,492
You're as big as a prize pig.

312
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,294
How'd you grow so fast?

313
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,300
I thought I'd lost you.

314
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,705
He's very friendly. Aren't you, boy?

315
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:57,846
Angus, Mummy will have a fit.

316
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,176
Don't you dare tell her.
Kirstie, please.

317
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:04,945
He needs me. I'm his only friend.

318
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,481
I saved his life.

319
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,034
The poor wee thing.

320
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:22,728
You won't tell?

321
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:26,204
-Swear.
-I don't swear, Angus MacMorrow.

322
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,502
I'll not speak a word.

323
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:31,639
You're a good sister after all.

324
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:35,803
Every 10 minutes....

325
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:36,756
Every 10 minutes....

326
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,582
Good morning, ma'am.

327
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:45,488
-Lovely morning, miss.
-Morning.

328
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:53,866
-Oh, God. I'm sorry.
-It's all right. Come in.

329
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,240
Come in.

330
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,078
You've done some very good work
around the grounds, Mr. Lewis.

331
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:14,915
Thank you, ma'am.
And it's Mowbray, ma'am.

332
00:38:16,192 --> 00:38:17,921
Oh, yes.

333
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:22,889
Did you know the guest bathroom's
been out of order for three days now?

334
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,896
I'll see to it immediately, ma'am.

335
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:30,067
I have some clothes. My husband's.

336
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:33,401
Well, you seem to be about the
same size. Would you care for them?

337
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,239
Well, won't he need them
when he comes home?

338
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:42,946
He's not coming home,
Mr. Mowbray.

339
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,856
His ship was sunk at sea.
It's been almost a year.

340
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:54,755
I'm sorry. Sorry.

341
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:56,496
It's just--

342
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,796
It's just that your son had said that....

343
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,069
Angus is a confused boy.

344
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:06,768
Confused?

345
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:10,807
Yes.

346
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:16,185
I have a lot to do.
Do you want them or not?

347
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:19,946
Yes. Thank you.

348
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:24,055
Aye.

349
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,057
Thanks.

350
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,924
Did you have to
turn him into a mummy?

351
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,788
It was getting too loud.
Somebody would've heard.

352
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:03,624
Quiet, Crusoe!

353
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:05,723
Who's there?

354
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,295
I'm here to fix the bathroom.

355
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:11,503
-We're using it.
-What, both of you?

356
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,676
But I thought it was out of order.

357
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,509
What's that noise?

358
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,915
I have a cough.

359
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,742
You got an animal in there?

360
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:26,410
Look, you better let me in
or your mother will hear about this.

361
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,985
-No.
-Let me in.

362
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,099
Listen, you two, all right?
I have to do my job.

363
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:45,235
Your mother told me this bathroom
has been out of order--

364
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:46,704
What-- What is that?

365
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:52,274
He came from an egg at the tide pool.
His name's Crusoe.

366
00:40:58,254 --> 00:41:00,449
What in the name of--?

367
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,584
He's very friendly.

368
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:20,703
Mary and Joseph.

369
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,277
-He almost died when he was born.
-Almost took my hand off.

370
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:26,545
He thinks I'm his father.

371
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:32,354
I wonder....

372
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,217
-It just can't be.
-Can't be what?

373
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:38,024
Well, it looks like a....

374
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:42,125
-Like a bloody water horse.
-A what?

375
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:46,968
They're make-believe.
A legend from the Celtic past.

376
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,095
They're said to be
the rarest of all creatures.

377
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:54,606
There can be only one water horse
in the world at a time.

378
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:59,447
When the one grows old,
it lays a single egg, and then it dies.

379
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:02,316
-Crusoe's a girl?
-No.

380
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,817
No, lad, he's girl and boy both.

381
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:07,854
The beast is both mum and dad
to the egg.

382
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:13,561
The old water horse dies
before the egg hatches...

383
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:16,926
...so the new water horse
is born an orphan.

384
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,867
Oh, that's sad.

385
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,439
It's an amazing thing though, isn't it?

386
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:27,837
Angus! Kirstie!

387
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,103
Don't tell her.
She'd make us get rid of it.

388
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,803
Angus?

389
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:33,814
Will you help us, Mr. Lewis?

390
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,516
You're asking me
to deceive your mother.

391
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:41,889
Angus? Kirstie?

392
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:49,787
-What are you doing in there?
-I was helping Mr. Lewis fix the pipes.

393
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,365
Since when have pipes
been an interest of yours?

394
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:56,633
-Wait! It's a bad time to interrupt him.
-What?

395
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,899
Plumbing is tricky. It's like surgery.

396
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:02,168
One mistake could mean death.

397
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,546
Mr. Lewis found the problem.

398
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,246
I can explain. He--

399
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:20,892
Always been handy
with the plumbing.

400
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,061
He's a genius.

401
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,063
And you helped, did you, Angus?

402
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,257
Yes, I--

403
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:29,233
-I handed the tools.
-And you, Kirstie?

404
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:32,897
No. I came to get Angus to show him
the civil assistance manual.

405
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:40,576
It's getting a bit cramped in here,
so off you go. Did a grand job, Angus.

406
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,013
Bye.

407
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:48,654
It's the pipes.

408
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:52,760
It's the air locks bubbling through,
you see.

409
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,625
Angus was a great help.

410
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,798
So you said.

411
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,400
Oh, dear. Excuse me. That's--

412
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:04,539
The doctor warned me
not to eat haggis for breakfast.

413
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,299
So it's something about the...

414
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:10,908
...texture of the innards mixed in
with the suet that I just can't....

415
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:14,606
Thank you, thank you. You've
explained that quite enough.

416
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:23,687
Shut your ugly gob. You bloody near
got me sacked, you wee ingrate.

417
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:34,601
Captain, we'll have that bathroom
up and running by tonight.

418
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,533
Oh, wonderful.

419
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,467
Would you allow me to organize
a meal tomorrow evening?

420
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:40,973
As a token of our gratitude.

421
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:44,078
Just the officers and yourself,
of course, as guest of honor.

422
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,078
Thank you very much.
That'd be very nice.

423
00:44:50,453 --> 00:44:53,183
Excellent. Shall we say 8:00?

424
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:58,292
What are we going to do?

425
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:01,156
One thing's sure, you need to
get him out of the house.

426
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:03,662
-But where can I put him?
-In the loch.

427
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:06,630
No! I want Crusoe to stay.
He's mine!

428
00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:09,930
But he can't spend his life
in a toilet bowl.

429
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,974
-But he can stay with me.
-Whatever the devil he is...

430
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:14,871
...he's meant to swim and be free.

431
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,775
The loch is loaded
with salmon to eat...

432
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,211
...and there's plenty of water for him
to grow and move around in.

433
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:25,183
-You want what's best for him?
-What's best for him is to be with me.

434
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:54,914
Excuse me, sir. Mrs. MacMorrow.

435
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:57,644
Anyone for champagne?

436
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:02,821
-Thank you.
-That was very good, sir.

437
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:06,952
It was brilliant tonight,
with the last change from the--

438
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:12,526
Mrs. MacMorrow, you look radiant.

439
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:16,833
In Scotland
we call that a fib, captain.

440
00:46:17,673 --> 00:46:19,573
Let me introduce you.

441
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,843
I love to watch a man work.

442
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:39,954
-Go easy.
-Don't we deserve it, eh?

443
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,140
Gentlemen.

444
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:01,808
The king, the regiment...

445
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,347
...and the lady of the house.

446
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:09,355
The king, the regiment
and the lady of the house.

447
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:14,788
Well, gentlemen, technically speaking
I'm not actually the lady of the house...

448
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:18,558
...but I suppose for tonight
I'm happy enough to serve that role.

449
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:20,798
-Thank you.
-She's charming.

450
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:24,102
Here you are. Look what I've got.

451
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:28,903
Don't be greedy now.

452
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:39,216
Angus, come quickly.
I've something funny to show you.

453
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,982
I'll be back in a minute, Crusoe.

454
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:46,457
You're not going to believe this.

455
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:59,097
You're a fine woman, Gracie.

456
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:54,525
Gracie!

457
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:58,296
Oh, my God.
I don't know what came over me.

458
00:48:58,501 --> 00:48:59,593
Just a bit of fun.

459
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:04,534
Where's the dog?

460
00:49:47,216 --> 00:49:48,274
Oh, no.

461
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,800
Do you know why I take two pairs
of trousers onto the golf course?

462
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,063
In case I get a hole in one.

463
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:45,663
Did you hear something?

464
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:49,971
No, no. Maybe this old house
has one or two ghosts, huh?

465
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:53,637
Oh, I don't believe in such things,
captain.

466
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,852
Come here, you bloody mongrel.

467
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,479
I'm sure I can hear something.

468
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,681
Yes, that time
I distinctly heard something.

469
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:17,398
Crusoe, no!

470
00:51:21,177 --> 00:51:22,769
What's that now?

471
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,588
Come on, Crusoe! Get out of here!

472
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:41,423
-Take your hand off me, man.
-Angus, come right back here!

473
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,731
Crusoe, come back!

474
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:01,708
Mr. Lewis, what in goodness sake?

475
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,613
Sorry, the name's Mowbray, ma'am.

476
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,650
-What?
-Sorry, ma'am.

477
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:09,256
The dog got loose,
and I was trying to catch him.

478
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,358
I should say you failed at that.

479
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:16,590
-Yes, ma'am.
-You think it's funny, Mowbray?

480
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,561
No, no. It's a very serious matter.

481
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:22,737
You hold your tongue, man.

482
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:26,738
You're not in your stately home now.
I'll not be taking orders from you.

483
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:28,937
That is quite enough.

484
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,909
Go and collect Angus and
take him to his room immediately.

485
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:33,775
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:11,811
Crusoe? Crusoe, come back.
We're all going to get into trouble.

487
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,717
Lewis, we've got to find Crusoe.
He's gone.

488
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:18,758
Yeah, I know. I'll find the wee devil,
and you go straight to your room.

489
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:20,519
-But, Lewis--
-Off to bed with you.

490
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:24,130
Or your mom will have both our hides.
On you go. Go.

491
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:39,246
Where are you,
you wee, smelly beast?

492
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:05,502
Angus. Angus.
Angus, wake up. I found him.

493
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,676
Can't we just
put him back in the bathtub?

494
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,741
No. No, I don't think so.

495
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:14,181
Jings.

496
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:21,018
Lewis, do you know anything more
about water horses?

497
00:54:21,223 --> 00:54:24,989
I think it was-- Aye, it was my Uncle
Lachlan who first told me about them.

498
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:27,594
Many years ago,
there was a lost traveler...

499
00:54:27,796 --> 00:54:32,290
...and he's weeping bitter tears
because he cannot find his way home.

500
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:33,798
He'd given up hope.

501
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:39,031
Then suddenly, who should appear at
the bank of the loch to this traveler...

502
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:43,701
...but a sea spirit. A water horse.

503
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:48,679
The traveler, no fool is he, knows the
water horse is a creature of magic...

504
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:52,684
...one that could grow
10 feet tall overnight.

505
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:59,152
So the traveler, he feeds
the water horse, strokes it...

506
00:54:59,361 --> 00:55:03,559
...flatters it with compliments.
And finally the traveler says:

507
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:07,793
"Incidentally, water horse,
my dear friend...

508
00:55:08,003 --> 00:55:10,938
...I'm wondering, if you've
no other pressing engagements...

509
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,008
...could I trouble you to carry me
across the loch on your back?

510
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,404
Show me the way home?"

511
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:20,742
Well, what happens?
Does the water horse help him?

512
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:23,774
I don't remember.

513
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:27,487
What? Does the water horse
help him or doesn't he?

514
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,682
Well, it was so long ago
that I heard it.

515
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:35,455
It either carries him across the loch...

516
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:38,462
...or it drags him down to the bottom
to his watery death.

517
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:41,765
I'm not sure which.

518
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,914
Here you go, your favorite snack.

519
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:27,204
Angus, run now!

520
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,714
Angus, run!

521
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,484
Faster. No looking back.

522
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,135
Mowbray.

523
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:56,370
You're all wet, man.

524
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:57,840
You been fishing?

525
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:04,482
No. I went diving, to see all those
submarines you're going to sink.

526
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:06,677
Oh, you like to mock the war effort,
do you?

527
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:09,119
No. No, I don't.

528
00:57:09,324 --> 00:57:12,316
Our forces over there in Europe
on the front lines...

529
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:15,186
...they're doing a great job.

530
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,530
I want you to stay away from young
Angus. Do you understand?

531
00:57:20,736 --> 00:57:22,931
I consider you a bad influence.

532
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:24,969
Is that so?

533
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,869
I don't know if you're a spy...

534
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:31,568
...or a deserter,
or just simply a coward, Mowbray.

535
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,509
-But I'm gonna find out.
-Oh, I see.

536
00:57:33,715 --> 00:57:35,580
They took you away from
the battlefront...

537
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:39,015
...to hunt for deserters and cowards.
Well, I'm neither.

538
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:41,951
So you can take that
Sassenach attitude of yours...

539
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:44,352
...back to where you came from.

540
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:49,423
You stay away from the boy.
Do you understand?

541
00:57:57,105 --> 00:57:58,800
I'll have a bit of breakfast.

542
00:58:02,544 --> 00:58:04,637
Wait, wait.

543
00:58:05,013 --> 00:58:07,243
-How does she feel?
-Oh, respectable.

544
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:09,542
-It's a nice one.
-Get the net.

545
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:12,915
You've got a keeper, for sure.

546
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:19,755
I'd say it's at least a five-pounder.

547
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:28,898
-Oh, my sainted mother!
-What on earth is it?

548
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:31,868
-It's a monster.
-It's a big fish, all right.

549
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:36,636
No, it's a monster,
a creature with horns. A devil!

550
00:58:36,845 --> 00:58:39,643
I told you to stay off that drink
in the morning.

551
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,045
It's a big fish, all right.

552
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:56,457
-It's gigantic!
-Oh, no!

553
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,928
Cut the line. Mother of God, cut it.

554
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:07,365
Are you mad? This is the biggest fish
I've ever had on. I'm going to land it.

555
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:22,989
-It's going to sink us!
-Okay, okay. Cut the line.

556
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:24,818
Cut the line before he drowns us.

557
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:28,826
For God's sake, hurry up. Hurry up!

558
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:45,143
Did you see it?

559
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:49,382
I saw it. Whatever it is.

560
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:57,558
Sir.

561
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:03,361
Now, young man, your mother has
asked me to enlist you in service.

562
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:07,228
You are completely aimless, and
we're gonna give you some purpose...

563
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:09,427
...make a soldier out of you, all right?

564
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:16,707
Left! Left, right, left!

565
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:18,436
Left, left!

566
01:00:25,253 --> 01:00:28,848
Come on, lad, hurry up. War'll be over
before you finish that spud.

567
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:36,895
That's very good, Angus.
Put your back into it, lad.

568
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:45,869
Left, right, left!

569
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:50,067
Left, left. Left, right, left!

570
01:00:57,152 --> 01:01:00,417
Keep peeling. I'll be back.

571
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:14,259
Very good. Now, on to the next one.

572
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:21,942
I want this vehicle spotless
both inside and out. Right?

573
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:24,704
-You understand your orders?
-Yes.

574
01:01:24,913 --> 01:01:28,178
You're in the army now. We have
a way of addressing officers, don't we?

575
01:01:28,383 --> 01:01:33,286
-Yes, sir.
-Good man. Well, carry on.

576
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:35,547
Now, Edwards.

577
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:38,385
We need to lay down
something for you.

578
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:45,563
We need to ensure that these grounds
are unaffected by our presence....

579
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,064
You wally.

580
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:52,365
-Right away, sir.
-Carry on.

581
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:25,740
Crusoe!

582
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:28,839
Where are you?

583
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:32,505
I'm sorry I've not been
to see you for a while.

584
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:36,013
I haven't been able to get away
until now.

585
01:02:54,903 --> 01:02:56,962
Crusoe!

586
01:02:57,305 --> 01:02:59,296
Crusoe!

587
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:04,277
Crusoe!

588
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:08,046
Crusoe!

589
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:11,876
Where are you?

590
01:03:27,135 --> 01:03:29,126
Crusoe?

591
01:03:34,776 --> 01:03:37,074
Holy mackerel.

592
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:46,984
Hello, boy.

593
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:52,319
Careful, don't tip me over.

594
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,660
It's good to see you, boy.

595
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,565
Wait! Don't go!

596
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,530
Crusoe!

597
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:17,685
Crusoe!

598
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:31,726
This isn't so bad. It's fun, actually.

599
01:05:38,366 --> 01:05:40,231
Crusoe!

600
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:14,234
Crusoe!

601
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:39,819
Crusoe!

602
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,422
What is it, Churchill?

603
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:22,360
Slow down, boy. Heel!

604
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,278
Shoo, shoo. Go away. Crusoe, go.

605
01:08:54,395 --> 01:08:57,228
Crusoe, go! Shoo!

606
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:07,600
I thought it was raining, but
when I looked up, there he was.

607
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,003
-No.
-Big as a house.

608
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:12,873
-So then what happened?
-I held out my hand, "Now, Crusoe...

609
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:16,517
...you have to promise
to greet me, not eat me."

610
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:19,152
-Did he greet you or eat you?
-He ate me.

611
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:21,015
Yeah, right.
That's why you're here.

612
01:09:21,222 --> 01:09:23,247
Like a sardine.

613
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,987
-There was everything down there.
-Come on.

614
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:32,427
There was even a shipwreck.

615
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:34,534
-No.
-Yes.

616
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:37,193
Yeah?

617
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,874
And I could just see a treasure chest.

618
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:45,170
And there was money in it.

619
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:48,508
-It was too far away for me to reach.
-Yeah.

620
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:51,849
It was amazing.

621
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:56,746
Ma'am.

622
01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:58,320
Did y-- Ma'am?

623
01:10:00,962 --> 01:10:05,023
-Did you need something, ma'am?
-No. No. Thank you.

624
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:07,029
For what?

625
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:09,796
For making them laugh.

626
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:14,973
Haven't heard them laugh like that
in a long time, especially Angus.

627
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:18,009
-He's a good lad, ma'am.
-Yes, he is.

628
01:10:19,681 --> 01:10:22,149
I used to make him laugh like that.

629
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:26,979
Maybe you should try again.

630
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,116
What?

631
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:37,524
Well, just give him
a wee bit more of your time.

632
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:42,765
Yes.

633
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:46,072
-Mr. Mowbray.
-Please, call me Lewis.

634
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:48,405
Where'd you get your scar?

635
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:52,076
Shrapnel.

636
01:10:54,616 --> 01:10:56,709
Almost took my arm off.

637
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,415
I was a gunner on a torpedo boat.

638
01:11:03,925 --> 01:11:08,555
We were dive-bombed by
a German plane, and I was firing at it.

639
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:11,621
Next thing, woke up in the hospital.

640
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:16,201
-Is it still painful?
-It's nothing.

641
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:19,999
I'm lucky, compared to
what some people have to....

642
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:29,048
It's a good thing I didn't lose the arm.

643
01:11:31,185 --> 01:11:35,281
I'd not be much of a handyman
with one hand.

644
01:11:35,556 --> 01:11:39,515
You know, I'd be a one-handyman.
Sorry.

645
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:45,365
No. I'm-- I'm sorry. Well--

646
01:11:45,566 --> 01:11:47,864
You will tell me if it's troubling you,
won't you?

647
01:11:54,008 --> 01:11:56,272
-Lieutenant?
-Yes, sir?

648
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:58,968
We had any news
on this Mowbray character yet?

649
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:02,707
Yes, sir. I put my report
on your desk yesterday, sir.

650
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:05,249
Mowbray's as clean as a whistle, sir.

651
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:07,978
County records show him
born and raised in Dornoch.

652
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:10,885
Enlisted in the Royal Navy, 1,939.

653
01:12:11,092 --> 01:12:12,855
Unblemished war record.

654
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:17,225
Injured in action, August 1,940,
and honorably discharged.

655
01:12:17,432 --> 01:12:20,595
He's something of a hero,
you might say, sir.

656
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:24,904
-Thank you, Wormsley, that'll be all.
-Yes, sir.

657
01:12:33,614 --> 01:12:35,275
The head on it!

658
01:12:35,483 --> 01:12:39,010
And a tail like a crocodile,
only bigger. Wasn't it?

659
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,519
You've been telling that story for
a week, and it changes every time.

660
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:45,158
-Scales or skin?
-Skin.

661
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,793
What's your interest, Jock?

662
01:12:46,994 --> 01:12:48,222
-Interest?
-Aye.

663
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,294
This is front-page news.

664
01:12:50,498 --> 01:12:53,831
The Aberdeen Argus readers
will want to hear of this.

665
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:55,798
Not a word of this is to get out.

666
01:12:56,003 --> 01:13:01,066
But Hughie, when the war's over,
there could be tourists, excursions.

667
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:04,005
This could put our Loch Ness
on the map.

668
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:07,409
I don't want it on the map.
Just leave things the way they are.

669
01:13:07,615 --> 01:13:11,517
If there's a monster in Loch Ness,
the world has a right to know.

670
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:13,346
Aye.

671
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:22,686
Well, it's a perfect day for it.

672
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:25,491
This is awfully nice of you,
but you don't have to.

673
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:29,500
No, I want you and the children to see
the important work that we're doing.

674
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:40,313
If it's a mammal, it can't stay
underwater for six hours.

675
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:44,474
Mammal, my arse. It's a monster,
it can do what it wants.

676
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:47,654
You just be ready.
This photograph will make us all rich.

677
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:49,322
Aye, aye.

678
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:54,227
Well, the first thing we did
was to cut an access road...

679
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,329
...all the way to the top of the hill.

680
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:59,659
All the way up to the location. See?

681
01:13:59,867 --> 01:14:00,891
Sir!

682
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:04,697
I know we've been an inconvenience
for you since we've been here.

683
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:08,535
But I think you'll be impressed
by what I'm about to show you.

684
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:25,987
This location, obviously,
has been strategically chosen...

685
01:14:26,194 --> 01:14:27,957
...for the long-range views.

686
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:32,690
Moray Firth in the east,
Loch Lochy in the west.

687
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,095
-Now follow me.
-Thank you.

688
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:37,930
Now, here she is...

689
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:40,733
...our pride and joy.

690
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:45,176
Now, before we fire up Victoria--

691
01:14:45,379 --> 01:14:46,903
That's what we call her.

692
01:14:47,114 --> 01:14:50,845
--I need you three
to remain here on the perimeter.

693
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:55,079
And you might wanna cover your
ears. She packs a hell of a punch.

694
01:14:55,289 --> 01:14:59,783
-Come on. Block your ears.
-We will be firing down the loch.

695
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:04,792
Let's see what sort of splash
she makes.

696
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:11,970
All right, men. Walker.

697
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,674
-The loch? No, he can't do that.
-What on earth?

698
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:17,106
I should have told you,
there's a creature there.

699
01:15:17,311 --> 01:15:18,903
A water horse. He could get hurt.

700
01:15:21,782 --> 01:15:24,307
What? Stop this nonsense
and let them do their work.

701
01:15:24,519 --> 01:15:26,817
-No, Captain Hamilton. You mustn't!
-Angus! Angus!

702
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:28,318
We're to remain over here.

703
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:32,015
Mother, please listen. He hatched
from an egg. I saved his life.

704
01:15:32,226 --> 01:15:33,955
-That is enough.
-Mother, it's true.

705
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:36,186
He's telling the truth.
You have to believe--

706
01:15:36,397 --> 01:15:38,194
-No! Stop!
-Fire!

707
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:40,957
Fire!

708
01:16:01,923 --> 01:16:03,652
Very good.

709
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:05,952
What happened?

710
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,186
Did they kill Crusoe?
That can't be the end.

711
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:11,160
No, no, no.

712
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:14,061
But it was the beginning of the end.

713
01:16:14,268 --> 01:16:17,704
Poor Angus was beside himself
for his creature.

714
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:20,965
He got into terrible trouble.

715
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,514
-No! Don't!
-Hey! You!

716
01:16:29,717 --> 01:16:31,309
-No! Don't!
-Control yourself, boy.

717
01:16:31,752 --> 01:16:34,550
Did I or did I not tell you
to wait over there?!

718
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:40,059
Angus, this is not the place for us.
Can someone drive us home, please?

719
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:44,228
-Certainly. Corbin.
-Yes, sir.

720
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:46,764
-Kirstie.
-Anne.

721
01:16:50,071 --> 01:16:52,505
The boy needs discipline, Anne.

722
01:16:54,775 --> 01:16:59,337
The captain lost all respect
in Anne's eyes that day.

723
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:01,276
All right, Corbin.

724
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:11,289
That creature'll never surface
after that bombardment. Puddocks.

725
01:17:11,492 --> 01:17:14,757
-You bloody pests!
-Aye.

726
01:17:14,962 --> 01:17:20,059
And he blew a big hole in Jock's plans
for fame and Jimmy's for fortune.

727
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:22,098
-To the left!
-Jimmy McGarry was a man...

728
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,431
...not to be lightly parted
from a pound or a penny.

729
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,370
-To the right!
-He had seen the monster...

730
01:17:28,576 --> 01:17:31,704
...and he was determined
the rest of the world should see it too.

731
01:17:31,912 --> 01:17:34,073
-Get out of the picture.
-Aye, go!

732
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:35,441
Off you go.

733
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,353
Aye.

734
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:45,787
-We have got it.
-We're going to be rich. Rich.

735
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:49,554
You can come in now,
you daft buggers.

736
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:52,827
Everyone had a tale to tell
about the monster.

737
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:58,234
Everyone except poor Angus.

738
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:01,636
He was sent to bed at 6
every night for a month.

739
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:03,469
Even his goody-two-shoes sister...

740
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:06,738
...could not convince their mother
of the truth.

741
01:18:06,947 --> 01:18:10,405
And no one
had laid sight of Crusoe...

742
01:18:10,618 --> 01:18:12,882
...since the bombardment...

743
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:17,456
...until that fateful night.

744
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:21,653
Blimey, that's it.

745
01:18:21,862 --> 01:18:24,456
-What's it?
-The monster.

746
01:18:24,665 --> 01:18:26,530
That's just what I saw.

747
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:32,962
If it's out there, I'll catch it.

748
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:36,976
Let's go hunting, boys.

749
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,745
-Angus.
-Kirstie?

750
01:18:44,952 --> 01:18:46,351
This is Lewis' idea.

751
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:50,547
If you tell Mummy I let you out,
I'll deny it. Do you understand?

752
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,964
Now everyone's talking
about seeing the beast.

753
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:02,135
You have to get him
to hide better or something.

754
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:10,068
Crusoe!

755
01:19:10,277 --> 01:19:13,838
Crusoe! Come!

756
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:23,086
Try again.

757
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:26,919
Crusoe! Come!

758
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:52,177
Crusoe! Easy, boy, it's me!

759
01:19:54,722 --> 01:19:57,316
-Lewis, what's happened to him?
-He's gone wild, lad.

760
01:19:57,525 --> 01:19:59,550
No. You're wrong.

761
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:02,260
You'll see.

762
01:20:04,999 --> 01:20:06,091
Angus, be careful.

763
01:20:16,343 --> 01:20:18,641
Easy, boy.

764
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:21,076
I'm your friend.

765
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:28,414
No, Angus!

766
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:52,302
It was your idea to put him in the wild.
You said it would be best for him.

767
01:20:52,513 --> 01:20:54,913
I didn't know that
they'd shoot at him.

768
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:57,310
This is your fault.

769
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,678
Will it work?

770
01:21:25,112 --> 01:21:28,445
Soft spot. Back of the neck.

771
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:30,913
Consider it dead.

772
01:21:44,598 --> 01:21:46,964
Did you shoot that plane down?

773
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:48,464
What?

774
01:21:48,669 --> 01:21:51,934
The plane you were shooting at
when you got hurt.

775
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:54,937
Well, it's not something I brag about.

776
01:21:56,176 --> 01:21:57,768
Why not?

777
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:09,351
-Crusoe.
-Angus.

778
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:15,757
You hear that?

779
01:22:16,263 --> 01:22:18,026
It's Churchill.

780
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:21,866
I think he's onto something.
Good dog!

781
01:22:22,069 --> 01:22:26,403
It's that dog. He'll tell everyone
where Crusoe is.

782
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,774
-Wormsley, over there. In that cove.
-I'll take her in.

783
01:23:08,115 --> 01:23:09,275
Kill the engine.

784
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,213
Where's he gone?

785
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:15,988
Churchill?

786
01:23:16,256 --> 01:23:18,190
Oi, Churchill!

787
01:23:21,195 --> 01:23:23,755
Maybe he's just
chasing a rabbit or something.

788
01:23:24,631 --> 01:23:25,928
That's not it.

789
01:23:38,912 --> 01:23:41,346
Someone kill it! Kill it!

790
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:51,081
Mayday! Mayday! We're on the loch.
And we're under attack!

791
01:23:56,363 --> 01:23:59,764
-Where is he?
-There it is, port side.

792
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:06,334
Shoot it! Shoot it!

793
01:24:08,142 --> 01:24:10,406
Turn the boat around.

794
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,169
Where is it? Where is it?

795
01:24:48,816 --> 01:24:50,511
Anne.

796
01:24:51,585 --> 01:24:52,779
Look, I....

797
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,178
I don't wish to carry on like this.
I apologize for my actions on the hill.

798
01:24:57,391 --> 01:24:59,916
No, no. We should apologize.

799
01:25:00,127 --> 01:25:03,756
Angus should never have behaved
in such an inappropriate fashion.

800
01:25:03,964 --> 01:25:05,693
-Sir!
-I do--

801
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,260
Sir! We just had a call from the loch.
We're under attack.

802
01:25:10,938 --> 01:25:12,769
-What?
-We're under attack, sir.

803
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:14,873
-Get me a sub. This could be it!
-Right.

804
01:25:15,075 --> 01:25:17,134
-Bring my jeep around to the front.
-Yes, sir.

805
01:25:17,344 --> 01:25:19,505
You take the children into the cellar.
Wormsley?

806
01:25:19,713 --> 01:25:22,011
Kirstie, Angus, downstairs now!

807
01:25:23,217 --> 01:25:25,344
-Angus is-- He's not here.
-What?

808
01:25:25,552 --> 01:25:28,544
-He's gone down to the loch.
-Oh, my God.

809
01:25:28,755 --> 01:25:31,189
Come quickly. Hurry, downstairs.
Go, go, go.

810
01:25:31,391 --> 01:25:32,858
-This is not a drill.
-Yes, sir.

811
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:36,552
Clyde, bring the car round to the front
of the house straightaway.

812
01:25:36,763 --> 01:25:40,665
-I can't let you. It's too dangerous.
-He's my son. You try to stop me.

813
01:25:49,443 --> 01:25:51,343
Go away from me!

814
01:25:52,212 --> 01:25:54,772
Go away. Go away from me!

815
01:25:58,085 --> 01:26:01,145
Oh, my God. Please.

816
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:05,487
No. No, please!

817
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:12,091
-Crusoe!
-Go the other way. Turn around.

818
01:26:12,299 --> 01:26:13,994
Please! Go.

819
01:26:21,775 --> 01:26:24,710
Crusoe! Stop! Put him down!

820
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:27,740
-Oh, go away!
-Stop it!

821
01:26:30,851 --> 01:26:33,752
-Crusoe! Stop!
-Angus, no!

822
01:26:41,395 --> 01:26:42,692
Crusoe!

823
01:26:45,432 --> 01:26:46,831
No!

824
01:26:52,105 --> 01:26:55,472
-Somebody! Get off me! Help.
-Crusoe?

825
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:41,315
Angus? Can you hear me?

826
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:45,787
Come on, lad. Come on, son.
Come on, Angus, breathe.

827
01:27:46,326 --> 01:27:47,793
Come on!

828
01:27:48,428 --> 01:27:53,058
If you have any magic in you at all,
use it on this lad, I'm begging you.

829
01:27:58,272 --> 01:28:00,172
Put the gunners on high alert,
understand?

830
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:02,934
Any sign of an enemy vessel,
you fire at will.

831
01:28:03,143 --> 01:28:06,340
-But, sir--
-No. You fire at will!

832
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:14,152
Come on. Come on, lad.

833
01:28:14,354 --> 01:28:15,787
Come on. Breathe, Angus.

834
01:28:15,989 --> 01:28:18,514
Come on, get some good Scottish air
in those lungs.

835
01:28:19,593 --> 01:28:21,652
Stay with me, Angus.
Stay with me, lad.

836
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:26,094
Come on. Come on, lad, breathe.
Come on.

837
01:28:35,242 --> 01:28:38,302
Come on, lad.
Come on, we should go now.

838
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:45,079
Know something? This old workshop
is the place I'll miss the most.

839
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,553
You'll look after it for me?

840
01:28:54,661 --> 01:28:57,630
And I'll bet you grow into these
by the time I get back.

841
01:29:02,769 --> 01:29:04,760
You keep them well-polished.

842
01:29:13,814 --> 01:29:15,975
We'll have none of that.

843
01:29:16,316 --> 01:29:20,582
You're the man of the house now.
I need you to be strong and sure.

844
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:24,522
All right, Dad. Strong and sure.

845
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,289
Aye. That's my boy.

846
01:29:33,066 --> 01:29:36,627
That's it. That's it.
Good lad. That's it.

847
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:39,066
Good boy.

848
01:29:42,075 --> 01:29:43,736
Crusoe?

849
01:29:51,718 --> 01:29:54,186
That's a good water horse.

850
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:03,288
-Thanks. Oh, God.
-Captain Hamilton!

851
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:04,897
Angus!

852
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:07,123
-He's all right.
-Angus, what happened?

853
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:09,131
-You got to kill it.
-What's happening?

854
01:30:09,336 --> 01:30:12,271
-I was only trying to save Crusoe.
-Who's Crusoe?

855
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:15,168
-Wouldn't believe me if I told you.
-It's a sea monster.

856
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,342
It was just there--

857
01:30:16,543 --> 01:30:19,706
-What are you talking about?
-I swear it. He was just there.

858
01:30:21,515 --> 01:30:25,815
A sea monster? Are you telling me
this has all been about a sea monster?

859
01:30:27,654 --> 01:30:28,951
What is going on here?

860
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:33,348
Has everyone gone mad?!
A sea monster?

861
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:37,192
There is no monster.

862
01:30:37,397 --> 01:30:39,627
There's just you
with your bloody gun!

863
01:30:40,901 --> 01:30:42,425
And you.

864
01:30:42,636 --> 01:30:47,096
Filling his head with tales
of sea creatures and magic?

865
01:30:47,674 --> 01:30:51,576
There's no monster.
And there's no magic.

866
01:30:52,045 --> 01:30:54,843
-Mother....
-There's just--

867
01:30:56,817 --> 01:31:01,254
There's just this war, and death...

868
01:31:01,922 --> 01:31:04,390
...and people acting insane.

869
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,192
What's wrong with everyone?

870
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:37,051
Angus?

871
01:31:37,257 --> 01:31:40,590
-Yes, Mum. I tried to tell you.
-Yes, you did.

872
01:31:40,794 --> 01:31:44,457
His name's Crusoe. I raised him,
right out of an egg.

873
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:45,995
Angus, be careful!

874
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:49,828
It's all right. He's my friend.
He's peaceful, really.

875
01:31:50,036 --> 01:31:53,733
He's not peaceful at all, sir.
The damn thing tried to eat me.

876
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:06,084
Crusoe! Get out of here!

877
01:32:07,487 --> 01:32:08,784
Crusoe, come!

878
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:11,379
Crusoe!

879
01:32:12,893 --> 01:32:16,886
-Oh, my God.
-Crusoe, come!

880
01:32:17,297 --> 01:32:18,696
Good boy.

881
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:21,561
-Come on. Over here.
-No!

882
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,259
Angus!

883
01:32:25,605 --> 01:32:28,165
Angus! Angus!

884
01:32:42,822 --> 01:32:46,019
Faster, Crusoe!
We have to get to the net!

885
01:32:48,628 --> 01:32:50,789
The sea. He's trying to
get Crusoe out to sea.

886
01:32:50,997 --> 01:32:53,124
Victoria base, come in.

887
01:32:53,934 --> 01:32:56,801
Victoria base, come in.

888
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,502
You have to do something.
You have to stop them.

889
01:32:59,706 --> 01:33:02,869
All the radios are down.
We have to get to the net.

890
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:11,782
All ammunition up here.
On the double!

891
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,820
Help!

892
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:19,522
No! No.

893
01:33:26,032 --> 01:33:28,057
You were in the Royal Navy.
That's right?

894
01:33:28,268 --> 01:33:30,702
-Aye, sir.
-Think you can handle this tub?

895
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:48,580
I see the channel. Now head to sea,
boy, as fast as you can.

896
01:34:06,206 --> 01:34:08,936
-Come on, keep it moving.
-I see something.

897
01:34:09,609 --> 01:34:14,410
The rain's too heavy to make it out
clearly. It looks like a periscope.

898
01:34:15,415 --> 01:34:20,284
Good God, it is. A German sub.
Prepare to fire.

899
01:34:27,694 --> 01:34:29,457
Fire!

900
01:34:33,033 --> 01:34:36,799
Go under, Crusoe.
We have to go under!

901
01:34:59,325 --> 01:35:00,349
-There!
-Where?

902
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,552
-Over there! Can you see them?
-I can't see him.

903
01:35:09,969 --> 01:35:11,266
-Rapp! Situation report?
-Sir.

904
01:35:11,471 --> 01:35:14,463
One of our own torpedo boats
is in pursuit of the target.

905
01:35:14,674 --> 01:35:18,701
They're on the run. Don't let them
get to the sea. Raise the nets!

906
01:35:35,028 --> 01:35:37,496
Faster, Crusoe!

907
01:35:42,135 --> 01:35:44,296
Go, Crusoe! Go!

908
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:24,872
What are we going to do?

909
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,740
-Angus!
-Over here!

910
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:30,313
Angus!

911
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:34,248
-Let him go!
-Do as he says!

912
01:36:34,454 --> 01:36:36,388
Go on, boy!

913
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:40,158
Angus, let him go!

914
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,819
Let go, Angus!

915
01:36:43,396 --> 01:36:45,387
Let go!

916
01:36:48,067 --> 01:36:50,968
You're the best friend I've ever had.

917
01:37:03,349 --> 01:37:05,874
I'll never forget you.

918
01:37:29,909 --> 01:37:35,176
No, Crusoe! You can't stay here!
Go and hide in the loch.

919
01:37:36,349 --> 01:37:38,340
Crusoe, go!

920
01:37:40,019 --> 01:37:43,352
Don't you hear me, you bloody fool?
Do as I say.

921
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:44,612
Go!

922
01:37:55,568 --> 01:37:57,433
Come on!

923
01:37:59,339 --> 01:38:01,432
-Come on, Angus.
-You're nearly there.

924
01:38:02,275 --> 01:38:03,640
-Come on.
-Come on, lad.

925
01:38:05,545 --> 01:38:08,173
Now give me your hand.
Give me your hand, boy. Come on.

926
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:10,349
Get him in the boat.

927
01:38:11,117 --> 01:38:13,381
That's it. Good lad.

928
01:38:15,255 --> 01:38:18,088
Where is he? Where'd he go?

929
01:38:25,632 --> 01:38:26,690
There he is!

930
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:44,308
-He's gonna jump the net!
-It's too high!

931
01:38:44,517 --> 01:38:46,417
He'll never make it.

932
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:26,755
You did it, Crusoe! Well done, boy!

933
01:40:09,335 --> 01:40:12,634
He'll not be coming back, will he?

934
01:40:14,507 --> 01:40:17,601
I think he's meant to be
on his own, dear.

935
01:40:18,578 --> 01:40:21,775
Not Crusoe. I meant...

936
01:40:22,782 --> 01:40:24,477
...Daddy.

937
01:40:30,323 --> 01:40:33,315
No, love. He'll not.

938
01:40:42,101 --> 01:40:44,661
-Look! Look, Angus! Up here.
-Up here!

939
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:46,532
-You have to come quickly.
-Look!

940
01:40:46,739 --> 01:40:48,001
Come on, quickly.

941
01:41:33,853 --> 01:41:36,788
Some say the creature
comes back from time to time...

942
01:41:36,989 --> 01:41:39,082
...looking for his friend.

943
01:41:39,358 --> 01:41:42,657
Some claim to have seen it
over the years.

944
01:41:42,862 --> 01:41:47,595
But the boy never saw it again.

945
01:41:50,103 --> 01:41:52,037
That's a wonderful story.

946
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:56,231
Aye. And all true, every word of it.

947
01:41:56,742 --> 01:41:58,403
Thank you....

948
01:41:59,145 --> 01:42:01,045
Angus.

949
01:42:01,414 --> 01:42:03,905
Angus MacMorrow is the name.

950
01:42:05,551 --> 01:42:07,815
He was so sweet. I know it's true.

951
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:10,750
-It's a great story, but it's not true.
-You are so cynical.

952
01:42:10,957 --> 01:42:12,515
William?

953
01:42:13,459 --> 01:42:15,324
William!

954
01:42:21,534 --> 01:42:23,229
William!

955
01:42:25,371 --> 01:42:26,633
William...

956
01:42:26,839 --> 01:42:29,103
...where are you?
