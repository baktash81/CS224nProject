00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,291
Yeah, I bet. Any suspects?

174
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:05,208
Talk to Corsetti. He already covered it.

175
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,582
I'm doing a different story
about how the murders are connected.

176
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,875
You mean the bows?

177
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,000
All three had bows around their necks?

178
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,624
I didn't say that.

179
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,874
No, I already confirmed Ida Irga.
Are you confirming Blake and Slesers?

180
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,958
I'm not confirmin' nothin'.
Why don't you take a hike?

181
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,458
[Loretta]
Only one I can confirm is Ida Irga.

182
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,124
What about the autopsy reports?

183
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,791
DA won't release them.

184
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,249
Wasn't one of them in Lynn?

185
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,416
Helen Blake.

186
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:35,250
Well, that's Essex County.
Different county, different DA.

187
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,874
Corsetti,
you know the medical examiner in Lynn?

188
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,332
[Corsetti] Yeah, I play cards with him.

189
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,333
See if you can get
the Helen Blake autopsy.

190
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,667
[Loretta] Thanks.

191
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,458
Okay. [sighs]

192
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,417
[sighs]

193
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,542
[sighs]

194
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,042
[phone ringing]

195
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,249
[officer 1] What's the one right next to...
[laughs]

196
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,332
Excuse me, I'm looking for Officer Dougan.

197
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,707
[officer 2] Dougan? No, he's not here.

198
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,791
You know where he drinks?

199
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,582
You know where Foley's is?

200
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,667
[door creaks]

201
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:23,917
Officer Dougan?

202
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,708
Yeah.

203
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,625
Uh, Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

204
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,625
Uh, you took the call for Anna Slesers?

205
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,416
[Dougan] That's right.

206
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,374
I need to ask you a detail
about the crime scene.

207
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,874
I don't think I'm supposed
to be talking to the papers.

208
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,374
No, it's nothing like that.

209
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,666
Uh... Just wanna ask
about the stockings around her neck.

210
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,750
Did you see if they were tied
in a single or a double-hitched knot?

211
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,541
There's no way I could tell by looking.

212
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,374
I would've had to roll her over, and...
I'm just a patrolman.

213
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,750
I don't touch the bodies.

214
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,333
Did it look decorative?

215
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,208
In a real sick kind of way, yeah.

216
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Thank you.

217
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,041
I just confirmed Slesers.
I've got confirmation on all three.

218
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:16,292
[Jack]
<i>All right. Get back here and write it up.</i>

219
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,750
[Loretta]
<i>What do these three women have in common?</i>

220
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,125
<i>Three shadowy patterns of attack.</i>

221
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,542
<i>Three knotted loops
that bind them together.</i>

222
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,333
<i>Strangers to one another
in life, they became sisters in death.</i>

223
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,583
<i>Each coming to the same horror-filled
moment of murder by strangulation</i>

224
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,541
<i>by a killer who came quietly,
who is careful in his derangement,</i>

225
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,917
<i>and self-possessed enough
to lock the door on his way out.</i>

226
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,503
- [knocking]
- [neighbor] Hey, you okay in there?

227
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,750
Open up! Hey, if you don't open the door,
I'm gonna call the cops!

228
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,750
- Nice work, kid.
- [Loretta chuckles]

229

230
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,916
[announcer on radio] <i>The city is buzzing
today after a story in the</i> Record American

231
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:18,832
<i>claims that three elderly women were

232
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,750
There's nothing in the <i>Globe</i>

233
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,875
Or any of 'em.

234
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,083
You beat the whole damn city.

235
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,917
I can't believe it. This is incredible!

236
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,916
The story's bullshit.

237
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:39,832
Been getting calls all morning
from my guys in the department.

238
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,124
- [buzzer sounds]
- [Phyllis] <i>DA's office for you.</i>

239
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,832
Hold my calls, please.

240
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,416
[Corsetti] She's in way over her head.

241
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,707
- You never should've sent her out on this.
- [buzzer sounds]

242
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,832
[Phyllis]
<i>I have Commissioner McNamara for you.</i>

243
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,541
I told you to hold my calls.

244
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,124
<i>No, he's here for you.</i>

245
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,249
Jesus Christ.

246
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,833
Fuck 'em.

247
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,874
Send him in.

248
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,208
[drink pours]

249
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,542
Ah, what can I do for you, Commissioner?

250
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,374
Was it your idea to send some skirt
down to the station house?

251
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,957
Well, her name's Loretta.
She was workin' a story.

252
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,792
Is that what you're callin' it now?

253
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,582
Hanging around the bar,
flirtin' with my guys?

254
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,416
Never even identified herself
as a reporter.

255
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:27,707
Now I've got every old lady in
the fuckin' city tying up my phone lines!

256
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,457
Just tell me what we got wrong,
and I'll print a correction.

257
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,457
It's barstool gossip, for Christ's sake!

258
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,332
Half the news in the city's
barstool gossip.

259
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,832
What the hell did we get wrong?

260
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,166
Homicide has been workin'
around the clock on this,

261
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,166
and we've got nothin'
to connect the murders.

262
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,832
What about the stockings?

263
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,624
Only one of the victims in Boston
had that.

264
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,124
The other one looks like a suicide.

265
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,124
- We got sources for both women...
- Sources!

266
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:54,708
It was a couple of dipshit beat cops
trying to bed that girl you sent down!

267
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,249
I'm telling you this as a friend.

268
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,833
If you keep running this story,
you're gonna end up embarrassing yourself.

269

- [chattering]
- [phone ringing]

270
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:10,958
[Jack] Loretta!

271
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,250
Shut the door.

272
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,666
I am catching hell over this story.

273
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,124
Now, Commissioner McNamara
says the whole thing's gossip.

274
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,457
Same with Corsetti's sources.

275
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,499
I confirmed every word of that story.

276
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,374
You identified yourself as a reporter?

277
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,707
Of course I did.

278
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,083
- Even at the bar?
- Especially at the bar.

279
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,833
I'm killin' the follow-up.

280
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,457
We beat everyone in the whole damn city,
and you're... you're just gonna drop it?

281
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,582
Yes, I am.

282
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,124
The story is good.

283
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,125
The story is a headache
I don't need right now.

284
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,292
And you're back on the lifestyle desk.

285
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,416
[Kelly]
She shouldn't be working like this.

286
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,041
[Loretta's husband] Oh, come on, Kelly.

287
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,124
[Kelly] She should be home
taking care of her own husband.

288
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,957
[Loretta's husband]
You check in a few hours a day.

289
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,582
It's not the worst thing in the world.

290
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,667
[Kelly speaking, indistinct]

291
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,999
[Kelly] You don't see how selfish it is?

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,207
[Loretta's husband] What do you
want me to say? We make it work.

293
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,041
[Kelly] Yeah, 'cause I watch your kids
half the week.

294
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:44,624
[Loretta's husband]
I appreciate your help...

295
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,542
[Kelly] She's going to ruin your children.

296
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,708
Hi, Kelly.

297
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,916
Hi, Loretta.

298
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,416
He offer you anything? Coffee? Tea?

299
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,167
I was just headin' out.

300
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,332
Tommy had a meltdown in the car.
Gave Patrick a fat lip.

301
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:04,000
Class pictures are tomorrow.
Might wanna ice it again.

302
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,207
Thank you.

303
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,417

[melancholic singing on the radio]

306
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,292
So, why haven't you asked me to stay home?

307
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:39,917
'Cause I know better.

308
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,917
No, I'm serious. Why not?

309
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,000
'Cause you'd be miserable.

310
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,500
Well, so what?

311
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:51,083
Our lives would be easier.
Kids would be better off.

312
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,333
- Says who?
- Your sister.

313
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,624
My mother. The neighbor.

314
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,958
What the hell do they know?

315
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,082
You'd drive us all mad
if you were sittin' around here all day.

316
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,167
[chuckles]

317
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:06,750
It was a great story.

318
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,458
Jack's probably just afraid to rock
the boat. Don't take it personally.

319

[home intruder]
Yeah, I got a call about a water leak.

329

<i>Loretta, it's Phyllis.</i>

Just came over the wire.

- Thank you.
- Who was that?

343
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,666
- They just found a fourth victim.
- Go.

344
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,582
- You'll get the kids off to school?
- Yeah, yeah. Go.

345
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,874
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,582
- Dad's taking you to school today, okay?
- Dad's taking us?

347
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,582
- [phone ringing]
- [child] Where are you going?

348
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,082
- [children chattering]
- Girls, hurry up! Let's go!

349
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,750
[ringing continues]

350
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,375
- I saw that.
- Wasn't hiding it.

351
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,666
Maybe you should.

352
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:54,749
Hello?

353
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,582
<i>It's Holland.
I need you on the Strangler story.</i>

354
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,124
<i>Jack put some amateur on it.</i>

355
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,207
That bad, huh?

356
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,957
<i>Can you wrap up
the nursing home story tonight?</i>

357
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,249
- [Jean] Yeah, all right.
- [handset settles in cradle]

358
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,332
What was that about?

359
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,166
[sighs] Holland wants me
on those Strangler murders.

360
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,832
[Jean's husband]
The hell's the matter with him?

361
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,999
What's that supposed to mean?

362
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,333
He's using you. Putting a girl
on a story like that. It's a stunt.

363
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,666
I need you to get the girls off.

364
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,000
[children chattering]

365
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,625
Here, take a seat.

366
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:28,707
Jean's gonna be working with you
on the Strangler story.

367
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,124
Oh, uh, no offense,
but I-I don't need any help with this.

368
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,332
It's not up for debate.

369
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,041
[Loretta]
What is she gonna cover that I can't?

370
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,999
The whole story, if you keep it up.

371
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,541
[smacks lips]
Where are you at with the fourth victim?

372
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,292
She have a stocking around the neck?

373
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,707
Uh, I haven't got confirmation yet.

374
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,624
Not yet? It's 40 minutes to deadline.

375
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,082
Police won't confirm.

376
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,457
Her cousin Arnold found the body,
but there's, uh...

377
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,332
There's no listings
for an Arnold Sullivan,

378
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,957
and no other relatives have come forward.

379
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,916
[editor] Jeanie, call around.
See what you come up with.

380
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:59,249
[Jean] I already did.
Police aren't talking. Corsetti tried too.

381
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,124
Never seen 'em this tight-lipped
about anything.

382
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,542
[Jack] That's 'cause they're bracing
for a shitstorm.

383
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,625
[editor] Find the cousin.
Otherwise, pull it from page one.

00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,041
[Loretta] What are you doing?

386
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:20,457
I'm calling everyone in the phone book
with the same last name.

387
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,249
You know how many Sullivans there are?

388
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,583
Better get crackin' then.

<i>Nobody here by that name.</i>

405
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:03,207

to confirm some details.

They just confirmed number four.

410
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,708
All right. Phantom's going on page one.

00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,207
[reporter] Are you confirming
the story of the <i>Record American</i>?

413
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,499
Commissioner! Is there a story...

414
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,166
[McNamara]
We are advising the people of Boston

415
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:36,374
to make sure they have proper locks
on their doors, in good working order.

416
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,957
Is there only one killer?

417
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,832
[McNamara] They're not to allow
any person into their home

418
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,499
till they are absolutely sure
they are a proper person.

419
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,541
- Especially women living alone!
- Are you confirming the story...

420
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,499
Keep your doors locked,
and don't let strangers in your home!

421

Are you confirming the story
in the <i>Record American</i>?

Is there only one killer?

423
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:55,042
I don't care if it's one killer or four.
We're gonna catch whoever did this.

424
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,874
- [reporter] Do you have any suspects?
- [reporters clamoring]

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,042
"No one knows fear as we know it."

[Loretta] <i>There is but one answer.
The Boston Phantom...</i>

507
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,458
<i>The Boston Strangler must be caught.</i>

508
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,792
Guess he's got a name now.

509
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:51,916
Shit.

510
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,500
- [chattering]
- [chuckles]

511
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,208
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

512
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:02,250
So, uh, how'd you become Holland's girl?
He poach you from one of the other papers?

513
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,125
He got me a job
when I graduated high school.

514
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,791
I was working at a lunch counter
down by the courthouse.

515
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,708
He covered a trial
the summer before my senior year.

516
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:16,417
I got to know him pretty well, and so he
offered to get me a job when I turned 18.

517
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,458
Back then, just living through the day
was an accomplishment.

518
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:25,124
I wore my school clothes when they first
sent me out on assignments.

519
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,916
I didn't have money for anything else.

520
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,458
Holland took pity on me
and lent me money for a new suit.

521
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,000
I never wanted to let him down after that.

522
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,791
I learned to hold my own,

523
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,791
and he started sending me out
on bigger and bigger stories,

524
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,708
and it just became my life.

525
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,750
I really can't imagine
doing anything else.

526
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:47,208
It's crazy to think your whole life
can turn on a chance encounter.

527
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,207
My senior year, I, uh...
I lined up with all the other girls

528
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,708
to register for nursing school.

529
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,457
But my English teacher, Mrs. Welker,
she... she pulled me out of the line

530
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,708
and had me apply for a scholarship
to go to college.

531
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And that was it.

532
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:05,041
I'd be changing bedpans
if it wasn't for her.

533
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,708
Thank God for Mrs. Welker.

534
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,708

538
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,082

- Hey.

539
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,957
<i>They found another victim.
It was a young girl this time.</i>

540
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,000
[gasps] I'll come in now.

541
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,750
What was that?

542
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,250
Oh. [sighs]
Another woman turned up. I've gotta go in.

543
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,542
You gotta be kidding me.
It's New Year's Eve for Christ's sakes.

544
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,166
Who's gonna take your mother home?

545
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,333
[stammers] I can take her now, I guess.

546
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,542
Go. I'll deal with it.

547
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,750

551
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,292
There's Joe.

[shutter clicks]

553
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:57,458
Hey, hey, asshole. Come on. Come on.

554
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,457
That's enough.

555
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,874
[scoffs]

556
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,041
[resident]
That guy came to my door earlier today.

557
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,542
He said he was here
to paint the apartment, so I let him in.

558
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:11,542
All of a sudden, he tells me I'm pretty
and asks me if I thought about modeling.

559
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,666
I got nervous,
told him my husband was home.

560
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:19,375
I pretended to go back and get him,
and when I came back, he was gone.

561
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,042
What time was this?

562
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,958
Uh, this afternoon. Three o'clock.

563
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:26,667
Could you describe him for me?

564
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,917
Uh, normal. White guy, dark hair.

565
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,458
He had workman's clothes on.

566
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,708
He just looked regular.

567
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,249
[professor on phone]
<i>She doesn't fit the pattern.</i>

568
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,000
<i>To switch from all elderly women
to a young girl is unheard of.</i>

569
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,166

570
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,666
<i>it usually comes from a trauma
that's been years in the making.</i>

571
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,499
<i>It doesn't just change all of a sudden.</i>

572
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,667
How sure are you?

573
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,624
<i>That's the going theory
with this type of killer.</i>

574
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,042
<i>But no one really knows.</i>

575
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,208
Did you know they were gonna do this?

576
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,749
You really think this is smart?
With that lunatic still out there?

577
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,874
I don't know what to say. All right?

578
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,957
Stanley was supposed to shoot

Who was that?

585
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,125
It's just a wrong number.

Are you having any problems
with people calling your house?

596
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,874
You gettin' hang-ups
and the, uh, heavy breathers?

597
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,249
- Yeah. They called you too?
- Mmm.

598
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,500
Nope. We unlisted our number years ago
after I covered my first mayor's race.

599
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,792
Yeah. Right.

600
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,208
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

Hey.

Got a smoke?

604
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:14,374
Been reading your stories.
They've been pretty good.

605
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,750
Well, have you got any leads?

606
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,666
Off the record.

607
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,749
Off the record? More than we can handle.

608
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,583
Are you close to making an arrest?

609
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,249
These people have no idea
what they're up against.

610
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,416
[Loretta] What people?

611
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,124
Uh, the whole department,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,625
The whole police department?

00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,791
He was helping her sort it out.

680
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,708
Sort it out? How?

681
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,417
[receptionist] He found a convent
in New Hampshire.

682
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,083
They were supposed to arrange
for an adoption.

683
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,917
Do you know if Patricia
wanted to keep the baby?

684
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,833
Maybe.

685
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:46,375
But Mr. Nielson has a wife and kids.

686
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,000
So that was that.

687
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,083
[parent] Beverly came over every week
no matter what.

688
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:01,667
She'd bring supper and we'd watch
the stories on the TV together.

689
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,917
Do you know if she had a boyfriend?

690
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:09,375
I don't think so.
School took up most of her time.

691
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,542
And the choir.
It's where a lot of her friends were from.

692
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:15,292
At church?

693
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:18,542
[parent] No.
At BU, where she was studying.

694
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh. That's where I went.

695
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,374
[scoffs]

696
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,750
I always thought she'd end up
being someone like you.

697
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,333
You know, with a job she loved,
living on her own terms.

698
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,500
I admired that about her.

699
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,875
She was doin' all the things I wish
I could've done with my own life.

700
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,874
You have kids?

701
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,542
Yeah. Uh, three.

702
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:50,458
Maggie's nine.
The boys are seven and five.

703
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:55,416
[parent] Beverly was terrified of the dark
when she was that age.

704
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:58,583
Only way I could get her to calm down
was by singing to her.

705
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:00,542
[sobs]

706
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,625
I'm sorry, I just...
I just can't stop thinking about it.

707
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:11,208
What he did to her.
What that must have been like for her.

708
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,416
[sobbing]

709
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:18,667
[choir vocalizing]

710
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,500
[friend] Beverly had just broken up
with her boyfriend.

711
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,417
She was taking advantage of her freedom.

712
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,124
Did you meet any of the guys
she was seeing?

713
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,792
Yeah, but they were all harmless.

714
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,625
It's her ex that she was afraid of.

715
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,667
Uh... Sorry, who is that?

716
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:13,125
Daniel Marsh.

717
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,583
Why was she afraid of him?

718
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,958
He was harassing her.

719
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,833
He had just gotten kicked out of Harvard,
was acting really erratic.

720
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:29,292
He'd call in the middle of the night,
show up unannounced. Things like that.

721
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,417
And when was this?

722
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,542
Right up until around when it happened.

723
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,667
[doorbell buzzes]

724
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:20,875
Daniel Marsh?

725
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,333
Yes?

726
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:24,750
Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

727
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,542
You knew Beverly Samans?

728
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:29,458
Come inside.

729
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,458
[door closes]

730
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,208
Come in. Come in.

731
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,750
It's just back here.

732
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:00,874
[machine rattling]

733
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,375
We can talk just back here.

734
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:11,582
Uh, I've just remembered that I've got,
uh, another appointment.

735
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:15,042
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to come back another time.

736
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,292
[door slams]

737
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,583
[Loretta pants]

738

[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

739
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,999
- [footsteps approaching]
- [doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

740
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,083
Here's everything on Patricia and Nielson.

741
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:40,249
[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

742
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,666
You okay?

743
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:42,750
Yeah.

744
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,417
Don't stay here all night.

745
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:46,708
I'm serious.

746
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:48,667
I won't.

747
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:52,167
[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

748
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,458
Wait, what did you say his name was?

749
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,958
No, you called me.

750
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,874
- Runnin' a hotline for the mentally unfit.
- [Loretta chuckles]

751
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,332
That's everything.

752
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:15,083
All right. Give me some time. I gotta
wade through this pile of shit first.

753
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,083
Don't wait on these.

754
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,292
They're good leads.

755
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:24,875
[door lock clicks]

[door lock clicks]

758
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,045
- [detective] Boston Police Department!
- [gasps]

759
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:02,458
Gordon Nielson?

760
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,379
- [Nielson] Yes.
- [detective] Hands on the wall.

761
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,374
[examiner] Your name is Gordon Nielson?

762
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,458
[Nielson] Yes.

763
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,917
[examiner] You've been divorced once?

764
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,124
[Nielson] Yes.

765
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,666
[examiner] Patricia Bissette worked
as your secretary?

766
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:18,750
[Nielson] Yes.

767
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,792
[examiner] Did you have a relationship
with her outside of work?

768
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,333
Yes.

769
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,153
[examiner] Did you see Patricia
the night she was murdered?

770
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:31,042
No.

771
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,625
Can I have an update, Detective?

772
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:51,500
We caught Nielson removing evidence
from Patricia's apartment.

773
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:53,916
He failed two polygraph tests,

774
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:56,082
but the DA still doesn't think
he has a case,

775
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,957
and there's nothing tying him
to the other murders.

776
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,416
So, what about Daniel Marsh?

777
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,917
Who? The Harvard psycho?

778
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:04,291
He's batshit crazy, I'll give you that,
but we got nothin' on him.

779
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,541
Well, he was harassing Beverly
the week before she was killed.

780
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:08,624
Uh, you can't charge a guy
for getting high

781
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,666
and calling his ex-girlfriend
in the middle of the night.

782
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:11,625
What, so that's it?

783
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:15,125
I-I don't think you understand
what I'm dealin' with here.

784
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,249
I'm gettin' a hundred tips a day,

785
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,457
I got thousands of sex offenders
to screen,

786
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:24,542
and now the commissioner just ordered
a raid on every gay bar in the city.

787
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:29,417
I'm doing all I can,
but I'm not playing with a full deck.

788
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,332
I'll see ya later.

789
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,333
[car door opens]

790
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:34,832
How many gay bars in Boston
are there anyway?

791
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:35,957
There can't be that many.

792
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:37,124
Way to miss the point, Jack.

793
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:40,249
The point is Commissioner McNamara's
not up to the job.

794
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,791
What does that mean, exactly?

795
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,082
His head's shoved up his ass.

796
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:45,124
They won't coordinate
with other police departments,

797
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,249
connections are being missed,

798
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,124
and good leads
are falling through the cracks.

799
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,541
Isn't some of that to be expected?

800
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,124
[Loretta] We are way beyond that.

801
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:52,916
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack, am I keeping you up?

802
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:54,999
Will you cut the shit already?
What's the story?

803
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,332
- The city can't protect its women.
- Come on.

804
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,749
What? You don't think it's true,
or you don't think it's a story?

805
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,916
[Jack] What is it with you?

806
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:04,124
You can't go after someone's livelihood
because you're impatient.

807
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:06,457
Ten women are dead,
and these assholes don't have a clue!

808
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:09,541
You don't have a story. You have a grudge.

809
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:12,166
How many women have to die
before it's a story?

810
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:13,250
That's enough.

811
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,916
These are good men busting their asses.

812
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:18,292
I'm not waging a war
on the police department.

813

Where you been?

816
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,292
I had to work late.

817
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,707
Oh, my God. Get a plate.
You're gonna make a mess.

818
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm not gonna make a mess.

819
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:59,457
Sit down. I gotta talk to you anyway.

820
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,625
Look, I've had a long day. Can't it wait?

821
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,917
Loretta, sit down.

822
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,042
I took a new position at work.

823
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:21,874
It's better pay, but I have to be
in the Connecticut office part-time.

824
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,042
Part-time?

825
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,750
A few days a week.

826
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,750
How long's this been in the works?

827
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,375
Couple weeks.

828
00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:32,457
And when were you gonna tell me about it?

829
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:36,707
A lot of long days lately.
Hasn't exactly been a good time.

830
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,167
How are we supposed to manage
with you gone half the week?

831
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,332
You're gonna have to do your share.

832
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,916
What more could I possibly do
short of quit my job?

833
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,249
Is this your way of telling me
to stay home? Is that what this is?

834
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,124
Come on.
Have I ever asked you to stay home?

835
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,124
No, you just do
something like this instead.

836
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:53,999
What, I'm free to do what I want as long
as it's on your terms, isn't that right?

837
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,374
You are unbelievable, you know that?

838
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:57,707
My... My sister's right about you.
You're just...

839
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:58,792
What?

down here couple of weeks ago.

851
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,333
Looks like it could be linked
to the stranglings.

852
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,832
Older lady.

853
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,291
Yeah, she turned up dead in a hotel room,

854
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:48,041
strangled with stockings
tied around her neck.

855
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:50,457
People from the hotel
saw the guy she was with.

856
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:54,207
Couple of nights later he shows up
at the hotel bar, so I pick him up...

857
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,958
[scoffs] ...find her cigarette case
still in his pocket.

858
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,208
<i>Only took me 45 minutes
to get a confession.</i>

859
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,499
<i>His name is Paul Dempsey.</i>

860
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,374
<i>Lives up in Maine,
but I can place him in Boston</i>

861
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,458
<i>at the time of the first five murders.</i>

862
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,624
Uh, I'm assuming
you went to Boston Homicide with this?

863
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:15,041
First call I made.
Couldn't get anyone to call me back.

864
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:18,249
<i>Couple of weeks go by,
so I make the trip up there myself.</i>

865
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,333
<i>Figure I'll just tell 'em in person.</i>

866
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,208
Couldn't get anyone to meet with me.
Can you believe that?

867
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:28,417
Detective drove four hours
for a homicide I'm working,

868
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,167
I'd walk out of my kid's christening
for that.

869
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,666
I don't know what the hell
they're doin' up there.

870
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:36,832
Turns out Paul Dempsey was a suspect
in a murder in Maine

871
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:39,082
four years
before the first Strangler murder.

872
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,124
The victim was an elderly woman
found strangled

873
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,707
with her stockings tied around her neck.

874
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:44,374
It could be the original Strangler murder,

875
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:46,707
but no one can get Boston Homicide
to look into it.

876
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,499
And this cop in New York
will go on the record?

877
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,957
Already did.

878
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,832
We're not running a hit job
on the police department.

879
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:54,832
They're blowing the investigation.
How long can we keep ignoring it?

880
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:58,042
I don't know how many times we have
to tell you, but we're not doing it.

881
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,125
I don't know, Eddie.

882
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,708
I mean, she's right.
We can't keep looking the other way.

883
00:54:05,292 --> 00:54:08,082
You really wanna use this paper
to tear down the police department?

884
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,207
If anyone else was blowing it this badly,

885
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,708
we'd have put it on the front page
a long time ago.

886
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,875
All right.

887
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:18,500
You want to run with this?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

888
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:21,625
But it's your neck on the block.
You understand?

889
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,375
All right.

we get a call about this guy,

was harassing these girls
in their apartment.

970
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,667
Then Boston won't share
any information with us.

971
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,500
So we just let him go.

972
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,167
I come to find out
he's one of their prime suspects.

973
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:36,792
We had him, and we just let him walk away.

the Green Man and the Measuring Man.

994
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:57,416
They called him the Green Man
'cause he put on green workman's clothes

995
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:59,416
and posed as the maintenance guy,

996
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:02,000
say he needed to check something
inside their apartments.

01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,624

And, uh, what about the Measuring Man?

998
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:08,666
[sergeant] I don't know where he came up
with this one,

999
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:11,000
but he'd pretend to be a modeling scout.

1000
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:15,083
And he'd convince these girls to let him
in so he could take their measurements.

1001
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:18,500
You wouldn't believe
how many people let him do it.

1002
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:24,249
He told me I had a nice figure.
He said his agency would hire me.

1003
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:27,333
He just needed to take some measurements.

1004
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,375
But he didn't have a measuring tape.

1005
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,000
He just used his hands.

01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:17,374
Uh, she said a man came to her apartment
the day Sophie was killed.

1013
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:19,707
Now, first he said he was there
to paint the apartment,

1014
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:22,042
and then he asked her
if she ever thought about modeling.

01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,832
I can't be caught dead
talking to you right now.

1019
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:38,917
- That bad, huh?
- No, I'm serious.

1020
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:43,000
If you gotta call me at the station,
you say you're my sister Sally, all right?

1021
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,667
What do you have for me?

1022
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,041
- It's not him.
- Well, it has to be him. Look...

1023
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:01,999
I mean, Sophie's neighbor said
he came to paint the apartment,

1024
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,666
but then he slipped up
and started talking to her about modeling.

1025
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:07,791
I mean, those are the two cons
DeSalvo is famous for.

1026
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:11,875
I worked DeSalvo for weeks.
I loved him for it. It's not him.

1027
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:13,791
What makes you so sure?

1028
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:16,041
He was in prison
for the first six murders,

1029
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:18,125
didn't get out
until after Sophie was killed.

1030
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
Whoever was in that lady's apartment
wasn't DeSalvo.

1031
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
[sighs]

1032
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:28,000
What you're feeling right now,
that's every day for me.

1033
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:32,500
You know how many people
I've gone down the rabbit hole with?

1034
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,749
It's a dead-end every time with this case.

1035
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,457
You get your teeth into something

1036
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:39,833
and then your bottom falls out at three
in the morning, and you got nothin'.

1037
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,917
And while I'm making myself crazy...

1038
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,417
he's out there somewhere...

1039
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,250
laughing at us.

1040
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:59,041
[thunderclap]

1041
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,125
[rain pattering]

1042
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:09,708
[sighs]

1043
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,667
[rain continues]

1044
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,125
[chattering]

1045
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,042
You still stuck on DeSalvo?

1046
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,291
Everything lines up with him.

1047
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:45,624
His history,
the progression of the crimes, everything.

1048
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,708
[Jean] Except for the part where he was
in prison for the first six murders.

1049
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,583
Have you seen the actual release records?

1050
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:19,708
[sighs]

1051
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:27,625
[sighs]

1052
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,292
[sighs]

1053
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:43,625
Look at this.

1054
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:50,541
Oh, my God.

1055
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:53,124
DeSalvo petitioned the judge
for early release.

1056
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,208
He said he had to get back
to his wife and kids.

1057
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:57,791
The judge let him out for good behavior.

1058
01:06:57,792 --> 01:06:59,666
So, he was out in time?

1059
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,417
Two months before the first murder.

1060
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:09,541
<i>A 33-year-old father of two
is considered a prime suspect</i>

1061
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,624
<i>in the Boston Strangler case.</i>

1062
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:14,624
<i>The suspect is presently confined
in a state mental hospital</i>

1063
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:17,667
<i>for allegedly assaulting a woman
last December.</i>

1064
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
We got beat.

1065
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,332
[Loretta] Who the hell is F. Lee Bailey?

1066
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:31,541
A hotshot defense lawyer.
One of those press hounds.

1067
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:34,082
How the hell did DeSalvo
get a hotshot lawyer?

1068
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,167
I don't know.
You want me to go do your job for ya?

1069
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:41,542
[chattering]

1070
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,292
What's on the docket tonight?

1071
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,041
[Loretta] I'm writing a story
about how Albert DeSalvo

1072
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:50,792
got a high-priced defense lawyer.

1073
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:55,083
Would someone familiar
with the investigation care to comment?

1074
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,541
No.

1075
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:59,499
[Loretta] So, what happened
when you went to question him?

1076
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,791
[birds squawking]

1077
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:04,125
[Jim] <i>Bailey got to him first.
Wouldn't let us interview him.</i>

1078
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:09,375
<i>So, I brought Sophie Clark's neighbor in
to ID DeSalvo.</i>

1079
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,707
She didn't recognize him?

1080
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,666
Not only did she not recognize him,
she ID'd someone else.

1081
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:42,791
Who?

1082
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:44,500
George Nassar.

1083
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,750
<i>Murdered a gas station attendant
during a robbery.</i>

1084
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,832
[scoffs] Real piece of work.
Schizophrenic with a genius IQ.

1085
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,250
And?

1086
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:03,833
It's not him.
Been in custody for over a year.

1087
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:10,333
[reporters clamoring]

1088
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,499
[Bailey] People can breathe
a sigh of relief tonight.

1089
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,291
The career of the Boston Strangler
is over.

1090
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:18,374
- [reporter 1] Is it true Mr. Bailey?
- [reporter 2] He's telling the truth?

1091
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:21,791
[Bailey] I obtained five details
only the killer could know.

1092
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:23,499
When I quizzed DeSalvo,
he went five for five.

1093
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,957
[reporter 3] Mr. Bailey!

1094
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:29,041
When you've done as many interrogations as
I have, you develop an ear for bullshit.

1095
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,499
[reporters laughing]

1096
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,792
And was law enforcement
a part of this process?

1097
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,625
That's all I'm gonna say right now.

1098
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:40,749
We're still negotiating his confession.
If you'll excuse me.

1099
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,249
- [shutter clicks]
- [reporters clamoring]

1100
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,667
[reporter 4] Will he confess?

1101
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:54,292
[Bottomly] This is John Bottomly.

1102
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:58,833
The date is February 14th, 1964.

1103
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:03,667
Albert, please state your full name.

1104
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:10,083
Albert Henry DeSalvo.

1105
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,957
[Bottomly] Mr. DeSalvo, we are here today

1106
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:19,457
because you intend to confess
to all 13 Boston Strangler murders.

1107
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,541
Is that correct?

1108
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:21,833
Yes.

1109
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:25,667
Tell me about your first victim.

1110
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,417
How did you pick Anna Slesers?

1111
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,374
I didn't pick her in advance.

1112
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,832
There was a parking spot
in front of the house.

1113
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:38,333
If there hadn't been a spot,
I never would have got her.

1114
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:42,333
[Bottomly] Albert,
what color robe was she wearing?

1115
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,542
[DeSalvo] Yellow.

1116
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,249
Hear about DeSalvo?

1117
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,707
No. What?

1118
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,499
They sent Bottomly
to take his confession last night.

1119
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,999
Bottomly interviewed him for five hours.

1120
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,958
And?

1121
01:10:55,959 --> 01:10:58,083
No one knows. He hasn't said a word.

1122
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,167
Can I have a word, please?

1123
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,125
I'll catch up.

1124
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,207
What's going on with DeSalvo?

1125
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,791
Nothing.

1126
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:21,958
If he confessed,
why haven't they charged him?

1127
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:25,416
Bailey used you guys
to pressure the attorney general,

1128
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:28,125
and then he set one condition
for DeSalvo's confession.

1129
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,583
- Yeah, and what's that?
- They're not allowed to use it in court.

1130
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:33,832
They didn't agree to that.

1131
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:37,541
They didn't have a choice
after you put DeSalvo on the front page.

1132
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:40,749
But they think they can get life
on the rape charges.

1133
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,750
And they're just gonna ignore the fact
that 13 women were killed?

1134
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:46,125
That's all I got.

1135
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:51,082
And I haven't even
told you the punch line yet.

1136
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,167
You know how Bailey's gettin' paid?

1137
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,333
He got DeSalvo a five-figure book deal.

1138
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,667
A tell-all from the Boston Strangler.

1139
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:04,083
Everyone just wants it to be over.

1140
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:10,208
[footsteps departing]

1141
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,332
[Loretta]
They're washing their hands of it,

1142
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,666
and that headline you're about to run
makes it easy for them.

1143
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:23,249
Come on.
The murders stopped. The guy's in jail.

1144
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,457
What the hell else you want?

1145
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:27,457
They botched the biggest investigation
in the city's history,

1146
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,457
and you're just gonna let them
sweep it under the rug.

1147
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,457
Aw, come on, Loretta.
How much trouble you gonna cause me today?

1148
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:34,082
Well, clearly not enough.

1149
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,082
Get outta here. Just take the week off.

1150
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,582
- I'm not taking the week off.
- I'm not asking.

1151
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,707
The police are washing their hands of it,
and you expect us to move on.

1152
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:44,917
- Loretta.
- We're not doing it.

1153
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,000
I took a new assignment.

1154
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:49,833
You've gotta be kidding me.

1155
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:56,207
[scoffs] You never see the knife
with you people.

1156
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:59,374
Don't get it twisted. If there's
another murder, I'll drop everything.

1157
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,708
But until then, we cover the news.
We don't make it.

1158
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,291
[footsteps departing]

1159
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:11,375
[footsteps approaching]

1160
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:21,916
Place looks nice.

1161
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:24,583
[Beverly's parent]
Oh. Sunlight always helps. [chuckles]

1162
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:29,875
Been reading your stories. You think
they're finally gonna charge him?

1163
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,333
[sighing] Uh, yeah.

1164
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,375
That's what I want to talk to you about.

1165
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:43,292
There's gonna be a story
in the papers tomorrow.

1166
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:49,667
They're not gonna charge Albert
with Beverly's murder.

1167
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:52,000
Or any of the murders for that matter.

1168
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,333
I don't understand. If he confessed...

1169
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:03,667
They made a deal with his lawyer, and
they can't use his confession in court.

1170
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,874
But they have him on other charges.

1171
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:10,082
And... And they're gonna make sure
that he never gets out of prison.

1172
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,000
[Beverly's parent]
But what about my daughter?

1173
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:16,792
It's not right
to just give up on her like this.

1174
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,375
How can they do that?

1175
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:27,333
[actor 1 on TV] <i>The price is £20,000.
English pounds sterling.</i>

1176
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:31,916
- [actor 2 on TV] <i>£20,000?</i>
- [actor 1] <i>Before I state my proposition,</i>

1177
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:35,250
<i>let me warn you not to breathe a word
of it to anyone except your chief.</i>

1178
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:38,208
<i>My life will depend upon your discretion.</i>

1179
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:40,417
Hey, the kids asleep?

1180
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:42,833
[Loretta's husband] Yeah.

1181
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,583

01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:27,042
So, when you entered the apartment,
can you tell me what you saw?

1350
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:30,374
[DeSalvo]
Well, the kitchen was on the left.

1351
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,625
[Bottomly] Wait... It was on the left?

1352
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:34,875
[DeSalvo] Um, maybe...

1353
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:37,082
[Bottomly] Well, here. Um...

1354
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:39,332
[paper rustles on recording]

1355
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:41,291
[DeSalvo] <i>That's right.
The kitchen was on the right,</i>

1356
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:43,625
<i>and the bedroom was down that hall.</i>

1357
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,333
[Bottomly] <i>That hall?</i>

1358
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:47,083
[DeSalvo] <i>That... Yeah. Down that hall.</i>

1359
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:53,625
Bottomly just showed him
the crime scene photo.

1360
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,541
[DeSalvo] <i>Um, maybe...</i>

1361
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:00,707
[Bottomly] <i>Well, here. Um...</i>

1362
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:02,457
[paper rustles on recording]

1363
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,416
[DeSalvo] <i>That's right.
The kitchen was on the right,</i>

1364
01:29:04,417 --> 01:29:06,833
<i>and the bedroom was down that hall.</i>

1365
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:08,542
[Bottomly] <i>That hall?</i>

1366
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,292
[DeSalvo] <i>That... Yeah. Down that hall.</i>

1367
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:13,917
Any lawyer worth a dime
would pick this apart.

1368
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:28,207
[Loretta] Excuse me, I'm...
I'm looking for Richard DeSalvo.

1369
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:29,500
[foreman] He's back there.

1370
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,167
Look,
Al's not talkin' to reporters anymore.

1371
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,167
Al's had it tough.

1372
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,958
Whatever my brother did,
he never meant to harm nobody.

1373
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:47,917
He loves his family,
always been good to them.

1374
01:29:48,542 --> 01:29:50,375
Look, I know there's more to his story.

1375
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:54,167
But there's nothing I can do
if he won't talk to me.

1376
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:00,875
I'll float it by him,
but I'm not making any promises.

1377
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:06,542
[phone rings]

1378
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:08,292
<i>Record American</i>.

1379
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:10,457
[DeSalvo] <i>Yeah, this is Albert DeSalvo.</i>

1380
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,833
<i>Is, uh, Loretta there?</i>

1381
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,833
One minute, please.

1382
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,458
Albert DeSalvo's on line two. [sighs]

1383
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:32,999
Uh, this is Loretta.

1384
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,499
<i>Hi, Loretta. It's Albert.</i>

1385
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,999
You know, my brother said
you come to see him.

1386
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,332
I told him that I knew you
from the papers.

1387
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:42,213
[chuckles] It's funny, I always said
you girls knew more than the police.

1388
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:46,792
Uh, why don't I come down there
so we can talk in person?

1389
01:30:47,417 --> 01:30:50,292
The thing is, I'm not giving my story away
for free anymore.

1390
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,624
I got really screwed over
on that book deal.

1391
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,707
[Loretta]
<i>I listened to your confession, Albert,</i>

1392
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:58,624
and, uh, I think
there's more to your story.

1393
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:01,375
Well, like I said,
I'm not talking to reporters anymore.

1394
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,249
Don't you want people to know the truth?

1395
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,582
<i>I don't give a damn about that.</i>

1396
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:07,916
I've got a family to support.

1397
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:09,957
I don't think you understand
how screwed over I got.

1398
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,666
Well, what are you holding out for,
Albert?

1399
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,583
If everybody already screwed you over,
then what've you got left to lose?

1400
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:18,208
<i>Why would you let them get away with it?</i>

1401
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,125
Come here tomorrow at visiting hours.

1402
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:54,417
[grunting]

1403

01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:13,542
Hello?

1408
01:32:13,543 --> 01:32:17,292
<i>Hey, it's Jack.
A report just came over the wire.</i>

1409
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,458
<i>DeSalvo was killed in his cell.</i> [sighs]

1410
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:23,875
<i>I'm sorry, kid.</i>

1411
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,292
[birds squawking]

[chattering]

1413
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,208
You get anything?

1414
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:39,707
[Stanley] No official statement yet.

1415
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:42,416
My guys at the <i>Herald</i> said
he got killed over drugs, but...

1416
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:43,791
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1417
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:46,125
[reporters clamoring]

1418
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:53,458
He was in there with them.
He knew what they were up to.

[phone rings]

1420
01:33:03,334 --> 01:33:04,416
Hello.

1421
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:06,333
I need you to take down an address.

1422
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:09,118
If I don't call back in an hour,
give it to the police.

1423
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:10,666
What the hell are you doing?

1424
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:14,416
426 Columbia Road. Got it?

1425
01:33:14,417 --> 01:33:15,749
Got it.

1426
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:16,917
Loretta...

1427
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:21,291
Shit.

1428
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:22,499
[doorbell buzzes]

1429
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,583
[footsteps approaching]

1430
01:33:33,042 --> 01:33:34,541
I'm lookin' for Harrison.

1431
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,000
He's down at the end of the hall.

1432
01:33:40,417 --> 01:33:41,917
[resident 1 coughing]

1433
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:50,792
- [resident 2 moaning]
- [muffled thudding]

1434
01:34:08,417 --> 01:34:09,417
[Loretta] Harrison?

1435
01:34:09,418 --> 01:34:10,500
Yeah.

1436
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:13,125
I-I'm a reporter with the <i>Record American</i>.

1437
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:16,125
I want to ask you some questions
about Bridgewater.

1438
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:26,625
Me and DeSalvo were in the same ward.
I saw him every day.

1439
01:34:28,792 --> 01:34:32,292
And what about... him?

1440
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:39,458
Yeah. He was in my ward too.

1441
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:42,792
They were always together.

1442
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:44,625
Marsh and DeSalvo?

1443
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,542
And Nassar.

1444
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:49,292
George Nassar?

1445
01:34:57,042 --> 01:35:00,708
Yeah, the three of them were always
working on DeSalvo's confession.

1446
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:04,542
W-What do you mean working on?

1447
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:09,208
They coached him.
They were at it every day for weeks.

1448
01:35:10,792 --> 01:35:12,707
<i>They had a stack of newspaper clippings,</i>

1449
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:16,417
<i>and they would quiz DeSalvo
about the details.</i>

1450
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,082
<i>I remember Marsh sayin',</i>

1451
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:23,417
<i>"You gotta get it so deep in your brain
that you believe it yourself."</i>

1452
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:28,125
But what did they care
if DeSalvo confessed?

1453
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:35,042
Reward money.
That's why Nassar got his lawyer involved.

1454
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:36,875
I'm not shittin' you.

1455
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,625
He's willing to confess
to the whole thing.

1456
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,417
[Harrison]
<i>His lawyer organized the whole thing.</i>

1457
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:45,750
You mean F. Lee Bailey?

1458
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:47,792
That's right.

1459
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:53,417
He told Albert that he could get him
a book deal, make him rich and famous.

1460
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,500
Albert thought he was gonna make
a million bucks off it

1461
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,750
and support his family.

1462
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:57,167
You got a smoke?

1463
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:19,125
So, you wanna know about Albert.

1464
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:21,625
How did you know each other?

1465
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:23,749
We were cellmates.

1466
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,167
[Loretta] Before he confessed?

1467
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:27,874
Yeah, for a couple months.

1468
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,375
It's an awfully strange coincidence,
don't you think?

1469
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:34,249
You're the one
who gets picked out of the lineup,

1470
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:38,000
and you just happen to be
DeSalvo's cellmate?

1471
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:40,958
Maybe I just got one of those faces.

1472
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:46,750
Were you in Sophie Clark's building
the day she was killed?

1473
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:48,875
No.

1474
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:51,792
I don't kill women.

1475
01:37:53,292 --> 01:37:57,792
And I got no reason to lie about that now.
I'm doin' a life sentence.

1476
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,000
[Loretta] Then why did you coach DeSalvo?

1477
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:04,250
I wouldn't exactly call it that.

1478
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:08,958
I was just helpin' him remember.

1479
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,916
Thirteen murders,
that's a lot to keep straight.

1480
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:14,208
Why were you helping him?

1481
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:18,833
Reward money. Ten grand a victim.

1482
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:24,250
So, the more murders he confessed to,
the more money you'd make?

1483
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:27,666
Well, might as well take credit
for all of them.

1484
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:29,041
Make a little extra money.

1485
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:31,292
It was a lot of extra money.

1486
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:38,792
And regardless of what you think,
Albert convinced me he killed those women.

1487
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:42,417
Was it all 13?

1488
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:45,542
What does it really matter?

1489
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:52,125
See, you all created a myth,
and it needed to be stopped.

1490
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:55,541
People wanted to believe it was Al,

1491
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:58,292
but they needed to believe
that it was Albert.

1492
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:02,125
The alternative was just too disturbin'.

1493
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:05,958
What's that?

1494
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,750
There are many Albert DeSalvos out there.

1495
01:39:13,208 --> 01:39:15,292
And your safe little world
is just a delusion.

1496
01:39:19,542 --> 01:39:20,708
Men kill women.

1497
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:23,875
It didn't start with Albert.

1498
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:27,542
Sure as hell doesn't end with him either.

1499
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:48,428
[Loretta] <i>If Dr. Grayson was right
about these killers having a type...</i>

1500
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:51,625
The first five murders
were all elderly women.

1501
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:54,957
- <i>And if Paul Dempsey had a type...</i>
- [shutter clicks]

1502
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:56,707
It was elderly women.

1503
01:39:56,708 --> 01:39:59,625
[Loretta] <i>DeSalvo was a pathological liar.</i>

1504
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:03,957
<i>Everything he knew about the first five
murders had either been in the papers,</i>

1505
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:06,000
<i>or it was given to him by Bottomly.</i>

1506
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,208
<i>But of the hundreds of women
DeSalvo assaulted,</i>

1507
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,833
all his victims were young.

1508
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:16,042
<i>And then Paul Dempsey moves on
to New York,</i>

1509
01:40:16,667 --> 01:40:18,583
<i>and the Strangler starts killing
younger women.</i>

1510
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:23,457
<i>Then other men use the Strangler as cover
to get rid of women</i>

1511
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,042
<i>they didn't want around anymore.</i>

1512
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:27,417
<i>The boss who got his secretary pregnant.</i>

1513
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:30,042
<i>The psychotic ex-boyfriend.</i>

1514
01:40:33,667 --> 01:40:37,333
<i>Then DeSalvo ends up at Bridgewater
with Nassar and Marsh.</i>

1515
01:40:38,667 --> 01:40:40,000
<i>They use DeSalvo.</i>

1516
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:43,917
<i>Nassar gets F. Lee Bailey involved
so he can claim the reward money.</i>

1517
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,167
And they coached DeSalvo
before he confessed.

1518
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:50,875
He just became a convenient way out
for everybody else.

1519
01:40:51,542 --> 01:40:53,708
<i>The entire city just wanted to move on.</i>

1520
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:01,750
<i>Nobody bothered to get to the truth.</i>

1521
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:06,167
[engine starts]

1522
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:10,417
<i>And people got away with murder.</i>

1523
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:52,833
[Jack] It's nice work, kid.

1524
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:12,499
Commissioner, Commissioner!

1525
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:15,707
What is your response to the story
in the <i>Record American</i> today?

1526
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:17,625
Commissioner, what is your response?

1527
01:42:19,292 --> 01:42:22,916
All the Strangler murders
are still open cases.

1528
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:24,333
I'll leave it at that.

1529
01:42:25,167 --> 01:42:27,082
[reporters clamoring]

1530
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:28,292
[reporter] Commissioner!

1531
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:30,375
How many suspects do you have?

1532
01:42:38,792 --> 01:42:39,792
[sighs]

1533
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:13,875
