1
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,839
<i>At the end of the World War
Tomainia weakened.</i>

2
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,669
<i>Revolution had broken out,
her diplomats sued for peace</i>

3
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,791
<i>while Tomainia's army fought on,</i>

4
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,198
<i>confident its war machine
would smash the enemy's lines.</i>

5
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,029
<i>Big Bertha,
able to fire 100 miles,</i>

6
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,436
<i>was to make its appearance
on the Western Front,</i>

7
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,154
<i>and strike terror into the enemy.</i>

8
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,638
<i>75 miles away was her target:
the cathedral of Notre-Dame.</i>

9
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,278
Range: 95,452.

10
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,313
Stand clear!

11
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,356
Fire!

12
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,119
Stand by your trigger!

13
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,511
Range correction: 95,455.

14
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,115
Breach secured.

15
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,509
Stand clear.

16
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,517
Ready... Fire!

17
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,988
Defective shell. We'll examine it.

18
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,035
Check the fuse.

19
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,469
Yes, the fuse.

20
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,992
Look out! Run!

21
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,590
What's that?

22
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,438
- Air raid.
- After Big Bertha.

23
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,119
The anti-aircraft gun!

24
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,594
To the gun!

25
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,148
Have you gone crazy?

26
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,269
Come down!

27
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,554
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?

28
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,435
Sir, the enemy have broken through.
Every man to the front.

29
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,314
Muster the gun crew!

30
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,559
Get your hand grenades, soldiers.

31
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,511
Where's your hand grenade?

32
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,912
Give him one.

33
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,109
Keep moving. Come along, hurry up!

34
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,637
Pardon me, but to work this...

35
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,189
Pull the pin,
count to ten and throw it!

36
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,589
Let them have it!

37
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,478
This is no time to scratch.

38
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,319
Pull yourself together.

39
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,309
Take this.

40
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,875
Forward!

41
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,910
Fall in!

42
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,158
Hey you, come on!

43
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,753
Order arms!

44
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,679
Prepare to attack.

45
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,234
Forward!

46
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,155
There you are.

47
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,920
The enemy!
Come on, let's get him!

48
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,028
May I come in, sir?

49
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,037
- Who is it?
- Friend.

50
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,790
- What division?
- 21st artillery, sir.

51
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,878
Take this and keep firing.
I'll be back.

52
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,913
Comrade! Help!

53
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,391
What is it?

54
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,592
I'm exhausted.
Quick, help me to my plane.

55
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,070
Thank you. I'll see you get
the Tomainian Cross for this.

56
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,073
Only too willing to oblige, sir.

57
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,712
You saved my life. Thank you.

58
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,149
I'll strap you in.

59
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,557
I can't make it alone.
You'll have to stay with me.

60
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,669
Can you fly?

61
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,154
I can try.

62
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,672
Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.

63
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,159
Take charge of that gun!

64
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,518
The enemy!
Quick, lift my hand to the throttle.

65
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,868
We'll fool 'em!

66
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,078
Hold on to these dispatches.

67
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,516
If we get them
to General Schmelloffel,

68
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,233
Tomainia may yet win.

69
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,469
I'm going to faint.

70
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,909
Don't say that.

71
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,109
Sorry.

72
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,035
Where am I?

73
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,548
Don't you know me?

74
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,117
Yes, I feel better now.

75
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,357
The blood's returning to my head.

76
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,834
What's below?

77
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,469
The sun?

78
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,588
Shining upwards.

79
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,791
Strange. How's the gas?

80
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,393
Kept me awake all night.

81
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,591
No, the gasoline in the tank!

82
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,430
Almost empty.

83
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,393
We must be nearly there.
What time is it?

84
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,032
Approximately one minute to twelve.

85
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,235
Strange.

86
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,274
We seem to be defying
the laws of gravity.

87
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,951
Water. Quick, I'm going to faint.

88
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,269
Wait a while.

89
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,632
We'll get into trouble
if you faint any more.

90
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,075
Just hold it.

91
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,793
I think I... Now...

92
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,514
Take it!

93
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,908
Something's wrong.

94
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,399
I can't reach it.

95
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,675
It's all gone.

96
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,589
What's the matter?

97
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,795
Belt too tight.

98
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,796
Loosen it.

99
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,956
I'm trying to!

100
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,635
We're upside down.

101
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,591
I know it!

102
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,630
The stick!

103
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,909
Impossible.

104
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,188
There it goes. We're out of gas.

105
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,150
Well, I suppose this is the end.
Cigarette?

106
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,395
Not now!

107
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,073
I shan't need this any more.

108
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,914
What month is it?

109
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,476
April. Spring in Tomainia.

110
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,079
Hilda will be in the garden,

111
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,599
tending the daffodils.

112
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,276
How she loves daffodils!

113
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,559
She'd never cut them
for fear of hurting them.

114
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,872
It was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil.

115
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,796
Sweet, gentle Hilda.

116
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,158
A beautiful soul.

117
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,758
She loved animals,
and little children, too.

118
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,671
We've landed! Dispatches!

119
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,833
Comrade, where are you?

120
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,720
The dispatches... Where are they?

121
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,071
- Are you hurt?
- Take me to General Schmelloffel.

122
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,954
If we don't deliver these,
we're defeated.

123
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,434
- The war's over.
- What?

124
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,629
We lost.

125
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,989
<i>Hynkel takes power.
The Jewish soldier</i>

126
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,711
<i>suffered a loss of memory
and remained in hospital for years,</i>

127
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,480
<i>ignorant of the change in Tomainia.</i>

128
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,075
<i>Hynkel ruled the nation
with an iron fist.</i>

129
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,955
<i>Under the double-cross emblem
liberty was banished.</i>

130
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,470
<i>Only the voice of Hynkel
was heard.</i>

131
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,155
<i>Adenoid Hynkel said,</i>

132
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,153
<i>"Tomainia was down
but today has risen."</i>

133
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,879
<i>"Democracy is fragrant."</i>

134
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,598
<i>"Liberty is odious."</i>

135
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,436
<i>"Freedom of speech
is objectionable."</i>

136
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,876
<i>"Tomainia has the greatest army."</i>

137
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,518
<i>"The greatest navy."</i>

138
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,155
<i>"But to remain great
we must sacrifice."</i>

139
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,438
<i>"We must tighten our belts."</i>

140
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,997
<i>He now speaks to Field Marshal
Herring, Minister of War.</i>

141
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,520
<i>Now Herr Garbitsch,
Minister of the Interior.</i>

142
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,630
<i>He remembers his early struggles,</i>

143
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,235
<i>shared by his two loyal comrades.</i>

144
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,711
<i>A reference to the Jewish people.</i>

145
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,679
<i>The Phooey remarks
that for the world</i>

146
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,076
<i>he has peace in his heart.</i>

147
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,430
<i>We now pause
for station identification.</i>

148
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,719
<i>This is the Pari-Mutual network,
bringing you</i>

149
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,798
<i>Hynkel's address to the children
of the double-cross.</i>

150
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,035
<i>The interpreter</i>

151
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,356
<i>is Hynkel's personal translator,</i>

152
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,949
<i>reading from a prepared manuscript.</i>

153
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,352
<i>Stand by for further commentary.
Go ahead, Tomainia.</i>

154
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,349
<i>His Excellency
is about to descend the stairs.</i>

155
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,798
Your Excellency, are you hurt?

156
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,559
Ride in the other car.

157
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,589
<i>His Excellency</i>

158
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,110
<i>seems pleased as he is greeted
by Tomainian children.</i>

159
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,515
<i>He pauses before a woman
with a child.</i>

160
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,794
Camera!

161
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,113
<i>Even the baby is thrilled</i>

162
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,436
<i>and seems all smiles
at the attention.</i>

163
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,670
<i>His Excellency leaves the scene</i>

164
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,558
<i>and will return
along Hynkelstrasse,</i>

165
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,712
<i>where he'll pass Tomainia's
modern masterpieces:</i>

166
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,508
<i>the Venus of Today
and the Thinker of Tomorrow.</i>

167
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,474
- How was it?
- The speech?

168
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,474
Very good.

169
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,598
Your reference to the Jews
might have been more violent.

170
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,710
What?

171
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,353
To arouse the people's anger.

172
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,428
Violence against the Jews might make
the people forget their stomach.

173
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,070
You're right. Things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately.

174
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,839
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.

175
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,469
What's good about it?

176
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,518
Conditions could be worse.

177
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,832
If you think so,
you have a great imagination.

178
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,037
You heard Hynkel's speech.

179
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,238
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubles.

180
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,280
You're better off
than a lot of people.

181
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,794
What about the barber?

182
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,753
Still in hospital.

183
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,235
He's been there since the war.

184
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,870
Why not rent
his barbershop for him?

185
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,592
He won't let me. Every few weeks
he writes to say he's coming back.

186
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,589
A pity it should be idle
all these years.

187
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,593
Why worry?

188
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,593
The government
will soon take it from him.

189
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,429
Perhaps you're right.
Not such a good morning after all.

190
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,439
Now you said it.

191
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,869
Hannah.

192
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,955
On the mantelpiece is my tobacco
pouch. Will you get it?

193
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,072
Everyone is full of troubles.

194
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,875
Yeah, everyone.
Look at Hannah, poor girl.

195
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,310
A hard worker, can't get a job.

196
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,558
Father was killed in the war,
mother died last year.

197
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,076
Can't earn enough to pay her rent.

198
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,749
What can I do?
I can't throw her out.

199
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,629
You need some more.

200
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,673
- Where are you going?
- Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.

201
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,118
You'd better take the key.
Mrs. Jaeckel and I are going out.

202
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,509
I'm locking up

203
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,309
in case the storm troopers
start their monkey business again.

204
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,870
<i>Aryan! We're Aryans!</i>

205
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,157
<i>And we go marching by!</i>

206
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,516
Look, fellows!
Tomatoes and potatoes.

207
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,672
I'll take a box home.

208
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,674
Hey, the lorry.

209
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,191
Hold it there, will you?

210
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,839
You have no right!

211
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,196
Just charge it to my account!

212
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,398
Nice ripe tomatoes.

213
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,477
Why don't some of you
do something?

214
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,513
If I were a man I'd show you.

215
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,713
What would you do, pretty?

216
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,476
Not one of you has the guts
to stand up alone and fight!

217
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,916
Is the lorry
in case someone hits back?

218
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,155
Shut up!

219
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,273
Come and take me.
You'll get medals for it.

220
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,279
You pick on women
and rob defenseless people.

221
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,599
Don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.

222
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,030
I'll have to do it again.

223
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,309
Pigs!

224
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,191
<i>- Patient 33!
- Yes, sir.</i>

225
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,036
An interesting case: amnesia.

226
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,510
Jewish soldier.
Been here since the war.

227
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,472
He thinks it's only been weeks.

228
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,591
Does he know what's happened?

229
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,872
No. His one interest
seems to be in his barbershop,

230
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,230
which he believes he left
a few weeks ago.

231
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,717
He'll have many surprises.

232
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,194
I'm afraid so.

233
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,318
<i>- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.</i>

234
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,238
He was to be examined.

235
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,839
<i>But he's disappeared.</i>

236
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,155
Disappeared?

237
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,828
Let him go.
It isn't a serious case.

238
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,556
There's little we can do for him.

239
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,758
Come on, get out of here!

240
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,033
What are you doing?

241
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,436
I don't know.

242
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,272
Leave that alone.

243
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,311
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!

244
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,635
I appreciate that.

245
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,990
When you talk to me, "Hail Hynkel"!

246
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,589
Who are you?

247
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,196
I'll show you who I am!
Come down to headquarters!

248
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,117
That's my shop.

249
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,430
I don't care if it is or not.

250
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,872
Going to put up a fight, are you?
Come to headquarters.

251
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,231
Let me tell you something.

252
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,040
Policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.

253
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,197
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone.

254
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,436
Attacking a storm trooper!

255
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,434
You'll hear from my lawyer.

256
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,312
He bit my finger!

257
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,835
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.

258
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,678
I enjoyed that.

259
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,718
But you'd better beat it.

260
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,718
- I'll call a policeman.
- No!

261
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,592
- Why not?
- Are you crazy?

262
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,909
More are coming!

263
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,998
- More what?
- Wait!

264
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,475
Come in here.

265
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,234
What's wrong with you?
Don't be foolhardy.

266
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,236
What's this? Who hit you?

267
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,398
I think it was a gang.

268
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,389
You'd better get fixed up.
We'll investigate later.

269
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,908
What time is it?

270
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,998
All right, they've gone.

271
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,239
Thanks, mister.
That did me a lot of good.

272
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,990
You've sure got some nerve.

273
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,396
We should all fight back.

274
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,071
We can't fight alone,
but we can lick 'em together.

275
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,512
We didn't do so bad.

276
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,513
You're the barber,
who was in hospital!

277
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,711
Mr. Jaeckel has talked about you.

278
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,877
We didn't think you'd come back.

279
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,796
The storm troopers
will be after you.

280
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,471
You'd better hide.
I'll get the key to the cellar.

281
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,231
- Is this the man?
- That's him.

282
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,029
Hail Hynkel!

283
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,595
Who's he?

284
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,840
Don't fool with me. Hail Hynkel!

285
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,350
Your hands.

286
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,552
Just a moment. Not here.
Bring him outside.

287
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,834
First you'll finish this.
Here.

288
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,234
Go on, paint that!

289
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,598
Wait a minute, boys.
I've got a bright idea.

290
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,399
Commander Schultz!

291
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,754
First in command.

292
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,549
Second in command.

293
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,674
Oh, never mind. You!

294
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,789
Who told you
to hang people from lampposts?

295
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,030
What was the trouble?

296
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,833
A Jew attacking storm troopers.

297
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,838
- Where is he?
- There.

298
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,513
Break ranks.

299
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,639
So there you are. Stand him up.

300
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,754
Get up.

301
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,393
You?
Don't you remember me?

302
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,995
- You saved my life.
- Me?

303
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,910
Strange. And I always thought
of you as an Aryan.

304
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,548
I'm a vegetarian.

305
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,037
Don't you remember?
We got away in my plane.

306
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,434
Plane?

307
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,278
Then we crashed.

308
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,759
Now I remember.

309
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,515
Well, how are you?

310
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,636
What's my friend done?

311
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,990
He resisted my men
painting his windows.

312
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,151
Any brave man would resist.

313
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,628
I'm sorry for this.

314
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,270
No harm.

315
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,353
In future you will not
be molested again.

316
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,400
If you or your friends
ever need help...

317
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,235
Who did that?

318
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,553
One of my friends.

319
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,915
<i>Hynkel's palace was the centre</i>

320
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
<i>of the world's
greatest war machine.</i>

321
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,554
<i>Behind it
was the dynamic Adenoid Hynkel,</i>

322
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,751
<i>whose genius ran the nation,</i>

323
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,794
<i>whose ceaseless activity kept him
occupied every moment of the day.</i>

324
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,799
<i>Marshal Herring is waiting.</i>

325
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,956
Enough!

326
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,989
I believe we've got something now.

327
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,397
A bulletproof uniform.
The material is as light as silk.

328
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,316
Where?

329
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,115
I've arranged for a demonstration.
It will only take two minutes.

330
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,793
I can spare one.

331
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,473
Professor Herr Kibitzen.

332
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,950
Actions speak louder than words.
A bulletproof uniform.

333
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,515
One hundred percent perfect.

334
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,354
Shoot!

335
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,319
Far from perfect.

336
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,156
- Where's my secretary?
- In the outer office.

337
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,270
Call her.

338
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,994
Take a letter.

339
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,637
<i>Herring here in the tower room.
We've got something marvelous.</i>

340
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,353
I shall be up.

341
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,753
A parachute.
The most compact in the world.

342
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,075
Worn like a hat.

343
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,073
It will open in 25 feet.

344
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,317
Demonstrate, professor.

345
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,511
Herring,
why do you waste my time like this?

346
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,313
Send Garbitsch here.

347
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,519
<i>Herr Garbitsch is waiting.</i>

348
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,949
Enough!

349
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,196
What's the meaning of this?

350
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,631
25 million for prison camps?
We need to manufacture munitions.

351
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,150
- We've made a few arrests.
- How many?

352
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,873
Five or ten thousand...

353
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,070
a day.

354
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,431
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters.

355
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,436
Dissenting about?

356
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,472
Working hours, wage cuts,

357
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,877
the synthetic food, the quality
of the sawdust in the bread.

358
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,796
What more do they want?
It's from the finest lumber!

359
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,313
Nevertheless, the people
are overworked. They need diversion.

360
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,635
The people, bah!

361
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,992
We might go further with the Jews.
Burn some of their houses.

362
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,515
An assault on the ghetto.

363
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,793
Something more dramatic. When can
we be ready to invade Osterlich?

364
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,990
Three months.

365
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,437
I can't wait.
Napaloni's army might invade first.

366
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,789
We must strike now.

367
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,798
We'll require foreign capital.

368
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,036
Borrow it!

369
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,588
The bankers have refused.

370
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,394
One man
might make us a loan: Epstein.

371
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,872
- Epstein? He's a Jew, isn't he?
- Yes.

372
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,872
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow from Epstein.

373
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,318
It might be difficult in view
of our policy towards his people.

374
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,795
Then we'll change our policy.

375
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,316
Tell Schultz all persecution
of the Jews must cease.

376
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,478
At least
till we've negotiated this loan.

377
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,314
I don't understand it.
The whole ghetto is so quiet.

378
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,319
You can't imagine
what was going on.

379
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,676
This Hynkel business.

380
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,595
You weren't here, you were
in the hospital, unconscious.

381
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,997
You don't appreciate
what a good time you were having.

382
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,438
If things get worse
we can go to Osterlich.

383
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,318
That's still free.

384
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,075
Sooner or later we'll have to go.

385
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,992
Anyway, it's nice to see you back.

386
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,710
It's like the old days again, eh?

387
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,748
How's business?

388
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,837
Very slow.

389
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,111
The men are in concentration camp.

390
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,038
You should fix up the women.

391
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,832
The beauty parlor business.

392
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,712
Know anything about it?

393
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,751
You can learn.
You can practice on Hannah.

394
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,270
Hannah, get in that chair,
we'll make you look beautiful.

395
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,913
What for?

396
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,435
He's going to practice on you.

397
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,272
Not with mud on my face?

398
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,478
No, we'll take some off.

399
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,358
Make me look beautiful?

400
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,233
Sure.
He can't make you look any worse!

401
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,233
Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry!

402
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,591
I'll give it to her.
You sit here and enjoy yourself.

403
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,592
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.

404
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,108
Don't pay any attention to him.

405
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,955
I like your shop
since it's fixed up.

406
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,108
I wish I had a business like this.
There's no future in housework.

407
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,275
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop some day.

408
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,559
But I can never save.
Money slips through my fingers.

409
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,038
I've always lived
up to every penny I've earned.

410
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,836
Why shouldn't I? You're here today
and gone tomorrow.

411
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,959
Do you believe in God?

412
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,030
I do. But if there wasn't one,
would you live any different?

413
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,635
I wouldn't.

414
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,912
Life could be wonderful
if people'd leave you alone.

415
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,197
Things are looking brighter now.

416
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,239
Maybe because of you saving Schultz.

417
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,076
Funny how they've left us alone.

418
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,635
Too good to be true.

419
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,553
Do you ever daydream?
I do.

420
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,594
That's the only time
I'm really happy: dreaming.

421
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,550
Sometimes I get so carried away
I don't know what I'm doing.

422
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,318
Aren't you like that?

423
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,031
We're very much alike.

424
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,231
- Both absent-minded.
- You think so?

425
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,872
I like absent-minded people.

426
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,716
Like the man who put his watch
in boiling water and held the egg!

427
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,997
All great men are absent-minded.
It's a sign you're smart.

428
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,197
My folks didn't think so.

429
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,118
You have an excuse.
You were injured in the war.

430
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,352
I was born that way.

431
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,594
I wonder
why women never grow whiskers.

432
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,431
Isn't that foolish of me?

433
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,359
I could kick myself in the shins,
I could...

434
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,919
I'll give you a shampoo.

435
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,637
Ain't I cute?

436
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,949
How did you do it?

437
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,871
You should try it on yourself.

438
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,916
Fixed up, you'd look handsome.

439
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,833
Four pecks a pound, new potatoes!

440
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,759
The potato man! I have to go.

441
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,033
Take it easy there.

442
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,273
Did you hurt yourself?

443
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,634
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.

444
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,909
How do you do?

445
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,915
Something's happened.
The storm troopers helped me up.

446
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,710
How wonderful
if they stopped hating us,

447
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,310
if they let us go about our business
like we used to.

448
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,036
How wonderful if we didn't have
to go to another country.

449
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,639
I don't want to go.

450
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,957
With all the persecution,
I still love it here.

451
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,918
Perhaps we don't have to go.

452
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,235
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd
let us live and be happy again?

453
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,917
Full stop.

454
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,676
Nothing works!
Not even a sharp pencil.

455
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,157
I'm surrounded by incompetent,
stupid, sterile stenographers.

456
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,356
I'll get you a pen.

457
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,870
Don't bother! I won't send it.

458
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,279
Get out, get out!

459
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,237
We've just discovered
the most wonderful poison gas.

460
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,790
It will kill everybody...

461
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,479
All right. Later.

462
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,912
<i>B76 to see Herr Herring.</i>

463
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,349
A lady. My secret agent.

464
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,228
Your secret agent?
Tell her to come here.

465
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,590
Have B76 come right in.

466
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,439
Any news from Epstein?

467
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,070
Our agent reports that all
the board of directors are Aryans.

468
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,271
- The loan's bound to go through.
- Good.

469
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,958
A strike at the arms factory.

470
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,151
- The leader?
- Five of them.

471
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,199
- Have them shot.
- They were.

472
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,753
How many were going to strike?

473
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,473
Three thousand of them.

474
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,518
Have them all shot.
I don't want dissatisfied workers.

475
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,711
These men are skilled craftsmen.

476
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,594
Let's train others first,
then shoot them!

477
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,199
Cannot afford to be lenient.

478
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,715
The rhythm of production
will be affected.

479
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,468
Rhythm...
All right, have your rhythm.

480
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,276
Spare the strikers and permit them
to return to work.

481
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,750
But mark them for future reference.

482
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,478
That's my department.
I'll attend to that. This way.

483
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,835
The strike leaders are all
brunettes. Not one blond.

484
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,917
Troublemakers!
Worse than Jews.

485
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,316
- Then wipe them out!
- "Doucement".

486
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,195
We'll get rid of the Jews first,
then concentrate on the brunettes.

487
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,836
We shall never have peace
till we have a pure Aryan race.

488
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,993
How wonderful! Tomainia,
a nation of blue-eyed blonds.

489
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,589
Why not
a blond Europe, Asia, America?

490
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,674
- And a brunette dictator.
- Of the world!

491
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,949
Why not?

492
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,434
<i>Aut Caesar aut nullus. The world's
effete, worn out, afraid.</i>

493
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,477
No nation would dare oppose you.

494
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,790
Dictator of the World!

495
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,198
It's your destiny. We'll kill off
the Jews, wipe out the brunettes,

496
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,914
then will come forth
a pure Aryan race.

497
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,315
Beautiful blond Aryans.

498
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,717
They will love you,
they will worship you as a god.

499
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,558
No, you mustn't say it.

500
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,437
You make me afraid of myself.

501
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,277
Dictator of the World!

502
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,149
We'll invade Osterlich first.
After that we can bluff.

503
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,078
The nations will capitulate.

504
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,874
The world will be under your thumb.

505
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,073
Leave me! I want to be alone.

506
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,278
<i>Aut Caesar aut nullus.</i>

507
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,195
Emperor of the World!

508
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,479
My world.

509
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,636
<i>The happy hour program.</i>

510
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,309
<i>Work with the rhythm of music.</i>

511
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,036
<i>Our next selection: Brahms'
Hungarian Dance number five.</i>

512
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,878
Fifteen cents, please.

513
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,752
<i>Happy hour signing off.</i>

514
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,315
<i>At six, Adenoid Hynkel will address</i>

515
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,750
<i>the children of the double-cross.</i>

516
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,389
It seems like the old days again.

517
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,477
How long is it going to last?

518
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,675
In the papers

519
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,589
it's rumored that Hynkel's going
to give the Jews back their rights.

520
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,790
Maybe.

521
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,435
What do you want?

522
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,110
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us any more.

523
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,237
Doesn't that make you feel good?

524
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,593
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel,

525
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,077
is you're so used to bad times,
you're unhappy without them.

526
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,517
Get my Sunday shoes.
They're on the windowsill.

527
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,554
I can't find the shawl.

528
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,074
I've got a shawl.

529
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,554
What's going on?

530
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,559
They're dressing Hannah up
to go out.

531
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,159
Is that so?

532
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,789
She's got a beau.

533
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,672
- Who is it?
- The barber.

534
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,830
Now, turn around.

535
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,393
- My dear! Those hands!
- What's the matter with them?

536
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,750
Those calluses. They're so rough.

537
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,155
Maybe I better not go.

538
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,512
Don't be foolish.
He knows you do housework.

539
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,314
Wait! I'll get a pair of mittens.

540
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,555
See if he's ready.

541
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,030
Not yet. He's polishing
a bald man's head.

542
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,871
Bad news. The invasion of Osterlich
will have to be delayed.

543
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,317
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend the money.

544
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,356
Epstein refuses, eh?

545
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,349
Send for Schultz.

546
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,193
Epstein refuses.

547
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,550
What did he say?

548
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,631
He complained of the persecution

549
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,395
and said he wouldn't have any
dealings with a mediaeval maniac.

550
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,717
He'll deal with a mediaeval maniac
more than he thinks!

551
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,478
First I shall deal with his people.

552
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,708
- Your Excellency?
- Call out the storm troopers.

553
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,873
A little mediaeval entertainment
in the ghetto!

554
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,839
At such a time
I think it ill-advised.

555
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,559
Such demonstrations
demoralize the country.

556
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,279
Indeed?

557
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,154
Since when
do you care about the ghetto?

558
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,517
I speak in the interests of our party
and the cause of humanity.

559
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,592
You need a holiday.

560
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,715
Fresh air.

561
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,789
A little outdoor exercise.

562
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,350
I'll send you
to a concentration camp.

563
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,231
Place Schultz under arrest.

564
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,717
Very well, but remember my words.
Your cause is doomed to failure

565
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,151
because it is built on the stupid
persecution of innocent people.

566
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,154
Your policy is worse than a crime.
It's a tragic blunder.

567
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,670
Traitor! Traitor!

568
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,797
You're a double-dyed democrat!

569
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,390
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?

570
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,312
Excellency,
here are the notes for your speech.

571
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,833
I'll not need them.

572
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,915
What I say will not be directed
to the children of the double-cross

573
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,430
but to the children of Israel!

574
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,557
That Hynkel isn't such a bad fellow
after all.

575
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,233
Most amusing.

576
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,075
Get a Hynkel badge!
A Hynkel badge!

577
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,719
A fine photo on each!

578
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,833
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.

579
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,309
Let's hurry.

580
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,470
Wait a minute.

581
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,035
What's that?

582
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,633
Turn off the radio.

583
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,279
The storm troopers!

584
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,792
- Bar that door!
- Get some water!

585
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,675
Get the women and children upstairs.
Lock all the doors.

586
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,949
You men, stay right here.

587
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,117
We've got to make a stand.

588
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,433
We might as well die
as live like this.

589
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,149
Wait a minute.
We have a social call to make here.

590
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,914
Wait a minute!

591
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,153
Schultz gave strict orders
not to molest anyone in this court.

592
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,873
These Jews attacked us.

593
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,116
I don't care.

594
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,799
Orders were to keep out.

595
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,359
You saw that!

596
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,795
I can't help it. Schultz's orders.

597
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,399
Let's get going.

598
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,879
Orders or not,
I'm going to get that girl.

599
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,396
Out!

600
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,953
Schultz arrested!

601
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,232
Hear that?
He's arrested Commander Schultz.

602
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,909
- A Jew corrupted our commander.
- Let's kill the louse!

603
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,715
Schultz is accused of treason,
and you know why.

604
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,953
Schultz was a friend of that barber.

605
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,754
Let's get the barber!
We want the barber!

606
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,672
It's the storm troopers!

607
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,956
- Get on the roof.
- No.

608
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,390
- They'll kill you!
- I'll fight.

609
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,150
Don't be a fool, you'll
be murdered. Get on the roof.

610
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,157
All right, here we are.
Smash in the door!

611
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,913
Come on,
we'll give the barber a haircut!

612
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,399
Where are the bombs?

613
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,472
There goes the barbershop!

614
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,396
Never mind. We can start again.

615
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,359
We can go to Osterlich.
That's still free.

616
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,836
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful.

617
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,032
Wonderful green fields,
and they grow apples and grapes.

618
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,188
His brother's got a vineyard.

619
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,199
Mr. Jaeckel
said he'd take me with him.

620
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,392
Now we can all go together.

621
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,709
It'll be wonderful
living in the country,

622
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,039
much better than a smoky old city.

623
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,191
And if we work hard and
don't eat much, we can save money

624
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,752
and buy a chicken farm.

625
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,430
There's money
to be made in chickens.

626
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,752
Look at that star!

627
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,512
Isn't it beautiful!

628
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,356
Hynkel with all his power
can never touch that.

629
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,996
All right, the coast is clear.

630
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,232
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.

631
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,517
He's holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there.

632
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,071
Hannah, you come and help
Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.

633
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,633
All right, I'll be down.

634
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,399
I don't understand it.
This crazy midnight supper...

635
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,075
What does this Schultz want of us?

636
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,513
- He wants us to blow up the palace.
- What?

637
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,357
We Jewish people shouldn't
get mixed up in such a business.

638
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,910
I know it but Schultz
has them all hypnotized.

639
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,317
- I knew he was up to some mischief.
- Sure he is.

640
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,118
I found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.

641
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,037
Don't worry, I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.

642
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,359
Gentlemen, may I claim
your indulgence for a moment?

643
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,952
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.

644
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,433
In order to carry this out
one of us must die.

645
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,393
In ancient times the Aryan tribe
of the Langobardians

646
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,717
made human sacrifice
to the god Thor.

647
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,599
At a feast
by lottery the victim was chosen.

648
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,390
Tonight, at this feast,
one of you will be chosen.

649
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,917
Each man will receive a pudding.

650
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,350
Concealed in one of these is a coin.

651
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,473
Whoever gets it
must give up his life

652
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,833
but he will join the long line
of history's noble martyrs

653
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,989
and will rid his country
of a tyrant.

654
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,995
I know that it is the wish
of all of us

655
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,993
to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.

656
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,629
Much as I should like to participate
in this ordeal, I cannot...

657
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,394
Why?

658
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,160
Don't you understand?
He's too well known.

659
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,391
It must be somebody like us.

660
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,519
I can't see it like that.

661
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,435
It is a question of my honor.
It is very embarrassing.

662
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,997
Commander Schultz,
I apologize for my friend.

663
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,392
Let me say, on behalf
of myself and the others,

664
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,150
that we consider it a great
privilege to die for our country.

665
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,109
Very well, then.

666
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,393
Gentlemen, I shall now retire
until fate has chosen the liberator.

667
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,716
Until then... Hail Hynk...

668
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,399
What am I saying?

669
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,319
Gentlemen,
we have pledged our honor.

670
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,950
Proceed!

671
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,678
Gentlemen, the coin is here!

672
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,999
What's the meaning of this?

673
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,629
Somebody made a fool of us.

674
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,632
- I did.
- What?

675
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,951
I put a coin in every pudding.

676
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,517
Blowing up palaces
and wanting to kill people!

677
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,597
We're in enough trouble!

678
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,952
Hannah's right.
We've all been foolish.

679
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,431
Our place is at home,
looking after our own affairs.

680
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,193
The papers say
Schultz may be in the ghetto.

681
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,596
Here, read it for yourself.

682
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,432
Hannah, read that.

683
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,638
"Mystery surrounds the disappearance
of ex-Commander Schultz."

684
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,276
"At police HQ it was believed
he may be hiding in the ghetto."

685
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,910
"A certain Jewish barber,
reported to be a friend of Schultz,

686
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,752
is wanted for questioning."

687
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,796
Me?

688
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,309
Only for questioning.
Not too serious.

689
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,753
Meyerberg was only wanted for
questioning. We never saw him again.

690
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,756
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr. Mann.

691
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,555
Did you hear what they're saying
about Schultz hiding in the ghetto?

692
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,715
I know, I know.

693
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,310
Don't you think it's serious
if they find him in the house?

694
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,116
Don't you realize

695
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,078
there are spies everywhere!

696
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,429
Spies?

697
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,795
What's the matter?

698
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,355
He's wanted for questioning.

699
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,549
Where's the Commander?

700
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,433
In the next room.

701
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,192
If Commander Schultz
is found in this house,

702
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,272
we'll all go
to a concentration camp

703
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,476
and have our heads cut off, too!

704
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,632
Am I arguing?

705
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,194
Then get rid of him.

706
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,879
You can't throw him out.

707
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,593
Of course not.

708
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,192
But I'd like to know how long
he's going to stay here.

709
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,955
Your breakfast is on the table.

710
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,313
Thank you. I have breakfast
waiting at home.

711
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,955
Search every house.

712
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,199
- What now?
- They're looking for Schultz.

713
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,391
He's in one of these houses.

714
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,875
They're always looking
for somebody.

715
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,519
It's me. Let me in.

716
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,070
The storm troopers
are searching every house.

717
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,679
Tell the Commander.

718
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,319
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

719
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,954
- What is it?
- The storm troopers.

720
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,674
- What?
- You'd both better get on the roof.

721
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,150
We can't leave all these things.

722
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,510
All of you, pack my cases.

723
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,675
You pack that.

724
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,873
Clear this shelf.

725
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,832
Pack this and this.

726
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,638
This mustn't be found.

727
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,074
Open the door.

728
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,514
They're here! Get up on the roof.

729
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,274
Nothing left behind!

730
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,436
- My golf clubs!
- The hatbox!

731
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,556
- Take this.
- Come on, let's hurry!

732
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,994
- Where are you going?
- With him.

733
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,474
You'll see him later.

734
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,796
- I'll meet you tonight.
- All right.

735
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,389
Take this.

736
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:35,990
Quick!

737
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,270
Open in the name of Hynkel!

738
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,079
Stop!

739
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,557
Look where you are!

740
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,596
I can't see, wait a moment.

741
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,359
My bag!

742
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,312
It's right here. Here it is.

743
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,074
Don't drop the other one.

744
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,594
My golf clubs, not my golf clubs!

745
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,156
Come here. They'll see you.

746
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,839
Quick, this way!

747
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,352
Woah, steady!

748
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,555
- Now be careful.
- Yes, sir.

749
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,232
Lucky you didn't break your neck.

750
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,039
You'll pardon me.

751
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,269
I'm sorry.

752
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,710
You guard the back. Wait a minute!

753
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,151
I'll have to bother you again.

754
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,235
There he is.

755
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,273
How are you?

756
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,235
So-so.

757
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,919
Here's your friend.

758
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,430
Your silence will be appreciated.

759
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,988
Take him to the wagon.

760
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,909
Where are you going?

761
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:18,996
Smoking room.

762
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,673
Come on, this way!

763
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,873
Osterlich!

764
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,600
I am pleased to announce
that we are at last

765
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,756
ready to march on Osterlich.

766
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,432
This was made possible by the genius
of Field Marshal Herring,

767
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,792
upon whom I shall now pin
a token of my regard.

768
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,112
Turn around. No!

769
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,748
Gentlemen.

770
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,319
To Field Marshal Herring!

771
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,077
To the invasion of Osterlich!

772
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,798
Elephant!

773
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,030
Wait.

774
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,390
Napaloni's army
is on the Osterlich front.

775
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,190
60,000 men are on the border.

776
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,668
To take Osterlich!

777
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,359
I can't believe it.

778
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,919
You can't believe it!

779
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,237
You let him steal a march on us.

780
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,351
I had the ground covered.

781
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,468
Declare war on Napaloni!

782
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,793
Mobilize every division
of the army and air force.

783
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,479
Attack Bacteria at once!

784
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,159
- But...
- Do as I tell you!

785
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,395
- Madness.
- Shut up!

786
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,555
Will you sign this?

787
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,710
What is it?

788
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,069
A declaration of war.

789
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,833
Yes. A pen!

790
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,229
I'll sign it.

791
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,710
A pen!

792
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,229
I'll sign it! Napaloni...

793
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,997
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.

794
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,553
Napaloni?

795
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,396
You talk to him.

796
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,550
What'll I say?

797
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,434
Be nice, affable, pleasant.

798
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,197
Well, well, how are you?

799
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,995
No, he hasn't been playing much.

800
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,550
You went round in 92?

801
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,157
His Excellency?

802
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,838
Just now he's a little hoarse.

803
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,075
No, I mean he can't talk.

804
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,713
May I take a message?

805
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,952
He says no doubt you've heard
about Osterlich.

806
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,468
He wants to discuss it.

807
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,154
Ask him to come here.

808
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:23,268
His Excellency invites you
to Tomainia to discuss the matter.

809
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,034
Very well.
I'll make the arrangements.

810
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,037
He's coming.

811
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,315
Good.

812
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,552
We'll put on the greatest military
show the world has ever known.

813
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,799
Napaloni will leave
the invasion of Osterlich to me.

814
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,635
And this?

815
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,513
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.

816
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,679
Peace is declared!

817
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,832
<i>2,975,000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square</i>

818
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,275
<i>awaiting Benzino Napaloni.</i>

819
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,032
<i>Entering the station is our Phooey,
ready to greet his guest.</i>

820
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,231
<i>This will cement the friendship</i>

821
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,439
<i>between our Phooey
and the Dictator of Bacteria.</i>

822
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,432
<i>His Excellency is about to greet
the Bacterian ambassador.</i>

823
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,951
How do you do?

824
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,513
Garbitsch...

825
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,951
See about the photography.

826
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,956
Tell the press to see that
our Phooey is well photographed.

827
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,310
- Not the back of his head!
- Yes, sir.

828
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,034
<i>Napaloni's train
is coming into the station.</i>

829
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,918
<i>From a pink and white carriage</i>

830
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,674
<i>Napaloni and his wife will step out</i>

831
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,918
<i>and Adenoid Hynkel will deliver
his address of welcome.</i>

832
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,153
What's all this mix-up-a?

833
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,112
They've gone too far.

834
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,874
At ease!

835
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,229
Bring the carpet.

836
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,318
Why can't-a we get out here?

837
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,919
No-a carpet.

838
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,235
Who cares?

839
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,432
Me, Napaloni, I never get out
without a carpet.

840
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,434
Lay it down here. Quick.

841
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,437
- It's going back.
- What?

842
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,590
Let's get out while it's stopping.

843
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,875
Shut up!

844
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,712
Take it away!

845
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,878
Stay here
until they've made up their minds.

846
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,030
You got-a da carpet. Put it down!

847
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,195
Here he is.

848
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,719
- My friend!
- Napaloni!

849
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,637
This is indeed a pleasure.
Welcome to Tomainia. This way.

850
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,074
Pictures!

851
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,158
Sure. Salute!

852
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,914
Another, please.

853
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,993
This is a pleasure,
my friend Hynkel.

854
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,594
You want another?

855
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,475
There.

856
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,798
Where's-a my ambassador?
Hello, Spook.

857
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,714
How do you feel?
Look after mamma.

858
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,678
Hynky, did you meet-a my wife?

859
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,918
That's her. Let's go.

860
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,312
Tomainia... very nice, very nice.

861
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,518
Your clock is-a slow.

862
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,514
This way.

863
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,393
It's-a very nice people.

864
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,996
The people are very nice.

865
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,276
Thank you.

866
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,713
He's my husband!

867
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,992
You make a mistake!
You make a big-a mistake!

868
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,355
Napaloni's army shall not invade
Osterlich. It belongs to me!

869
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,279
We shall not discuss
the Osterlich situation.

870
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,836
This interview is to impress on him
the force of your personality.

871
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,590
To make him feel your superiority.

872
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,151
Napaloni
is aggressive, domineering.

873
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,317
We must put him in his place.

874
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,476
But how?

875
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,273
By means of psychology.

876
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,120
By making him feel inferior.

877
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,958
This can be done subtly.

878
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,192
For instance,

879
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,352
I have arranged
that he'll be looking up at you,

880
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,073
you looking down at him.

881
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,675
His position will be inferior.

882
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,195
Then again we shall seat him
here beside your bust

883
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,757
so that if you relax
that will always be glaring at him.

884
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,470
Where is he now?

885
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,636
Resting.

886
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:38,913
I have arranged that he will enter
from the far end of the room.

887
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,431
Another psychological triumph.

888
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,792
He will have the embarrassment
of walking the entire floor.

889
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,792
<i>Signor Napaloni
is now leaving his room.</i>

890
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,350
He's coming.
Quick, give me a flower.

891
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,030
At all times
be above him, before him.

892
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,749
Entering or leaving
you must be first.

893
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,119
Hello, Hynky!

894
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,635
How are you feel?

895
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,357
My brother dictate!

896
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:25,589
You're a nice-a little man.
I'm so glad to see you again.

897
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,151
And my friend the Garbitsch!

898
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,189
This is a lovely place.

899
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,311
I feel-a fine.

900
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,478
I just had a nice cold shower.
When you have the plumbing fixed

901
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,989
it'll be in good shape.

902
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,953
Won't you sit down?

903
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:08,157
Well, Hynky,
my dictator friend, you.

904
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,719
I must be a-growing!

905
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,430
What do they give me? A baby stool?

906
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,793
This is not for me.
I like it better upstairs.

907
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,152
Garbitsch, this is a lovely country.
Very nice-a people.

908
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,595
I thought the public enthusiastic.

909
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,155
Sure. They like to see new faces.

910
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,596
I'm sorry for the mishap
that occurred to Madam Napaloni.

911
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:45,870
What's that?

912
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,349
I'm sorry for the Napaloni
that occurred at the... at...

913
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,390
Madam Napaloni at the station.

914
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,357
She's not used to public life.
She can't take it.

915
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,550
Match.

916
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,276
I'm sorry...

917
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,597
Don't apologize. I find-a one.

918
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,358
I'm simply crazy about this palace.

919
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,239
Ivory and gold.
A lovely combination.

920
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,471
Gets away
from that gingerbread idea.

921
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,991
Tell me something, Garbitsch,
what's on the program?

922
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,998
The grand ball this evening.

923
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,477
And a review of the army.

924
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,239
That won't take-a long!

925
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,714
I'm afraid it will.

926
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,070
So you got a big army, huh?

927
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,959
Modesty forbids.

928
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,798
Seems I've heard about it.

929
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,957
I think I'll get me a shave.

930
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,229
We have a barbershop.

931
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,073
Is that so?

932
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,359
You look blue under the gills.
What do you say we go together?

933
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,153
- Delighted.
- Good!

934
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,998
Very well, this way.

935
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,435
This is it. I can-a smell 'em.

936
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,598
This is-a very sweet.

937
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,995
It was the library.

938
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,474
A good barbershop.

939
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,557
- Too old-fashioned.
- Is that so?

940
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,473
When I get shaved
I like something to look at.

941
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,551
So I'm putting in glass walls.

942
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,792
This way, I shall have a view
of the mountains.

943
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,708
And this,
a view through the glass ceiling.

944
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,831
- What's above?
- The ballroom.

945
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,115
In my summer palace
I have a barbershop.

946
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,034
Is that so?

947
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,432
Also with glass walls.

948
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,829
You don't tell me!

949
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,198
With goldfish inside.

950
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,671
Goldfish swimming inside the walls?
How do you feed them?

951
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,509
You can't, they're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new one.

952
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,595
- Very interesting!
- You like it?

953
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,233
<i>The Hynkel stadium.
Before half a million spectators</i>

954
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,399
<i>the greatest ever display of arms
marches by in review.</i>

955
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:08,552
<i>Our beloved Phooey
and I'll-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated,</i>

956
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,070
<i>thrilled by this historic event.</i>

957
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,630
What?

958
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,432
Nothing. I'm just chewing.

959
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,993
Some peanuts?

960
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,150
- I've had some.
- Good shape.

961
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,236
Here you are, Spook.

962
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,034
<i>Now passing,
Tomainia's heavy artillery.</i>

963
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,468
It's all right.

964
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,355
I want to show you my new bombing
planes. They're coming over.

965
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,953
- Where from?
- Aroma.

966
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,479
Aroma? That's 400 miles away.

967
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:37,433
Right.
I don't know what's detaining them.

968
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,154
<i>Now passing,
Tomainia's light artillery.</i>

969
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,235
Very light!

970
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:49,871
<i>And here come the armored tanks,
the pride of Tomainia's army.</i>

971
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,151
<i>The latest design, the last word</i>

972
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,759
<i>in modern warfare.</i>

973
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,479
Where's the propellers?
For going under the water!

974
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,670
Under water?

975
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,238
You never heard of tanks that go
under the water and fly up-a stairs?

976
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,159
- What's that?
- Under the water and in the air.

977
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,558
Obsolete now! We're concentrating
on flying dreadnoughts.

978
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,313
- What's that?
- My planes!

979
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,711
<i>Now passing, Hynkel's
flying division number 34.</i>

980
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,353
Our planes!

981
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,476
You're right. They're yours.

982
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,873
Garbitsch!
The invasion of Osterlich.

983
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,914
Our troops, tanks and guns
will be hidden along the border.

984
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,839
To disarm suspicion,
you will go hunting.

985
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,554
Then you will show up
at Pretzelburg,

986
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,389
meet the army, step into a car
and cross over into Osterlich.

987
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,114
Herring and I
will be waiting at the capital.

988
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,550
First Napaloni must remove
his troops.

989
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,994
To be decided tonight.

990
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,435
Where is Napaloni?

991
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,715
I'll look for him.

992
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,675
It might be advisable for you
to dance with Madam Napaloni.

993
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,395
It'll carry weight.

994
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,272
You mean I will!

995
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,076
You find him!
And let me know at once.

996
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,439
- Madam Napaloni...
- Your Excellency!

997
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,190
Why so triste?

998
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,112
Because I no speak.

999
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,510
No? May I have the pleasure?

1000
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,874
Allow me.

1001
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,757
Madam, your dancing was superb.

1002
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,830
Excellent.

1003
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,189
Very good.

1004
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,755
Good.

1005
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,237
- My dear Adenoid.
- Benzino!

1006
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,634
I've been looking for you.

1007
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,956
Let's go to some quiet place

1008
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,117
where we can talk-a things over.

1009
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,596
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea. To the buffet!

1010
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,074
Of course, this way.

1011
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,672
There's a Tomainian proverb...

1012
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,276
Funny. I wish I understand it.

1013
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,874
Now about the border.

1014
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:26,956
Yes. No problem.

1015
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,832
It should be no trouble.

1016
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,758
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

1017
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,313
You, too. Out!

1018
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,150
Out.

1019
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,590
- So... the border question.
- Yes.

1020
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,189
It's just a matter of detail.
Formalities.

1021
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,310
Strawberries!

1022
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,194
- Have you any English mustard?
- English mustard.

1023
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,719
- That's da hot-a stuff?
- Very hot.

1024
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:05,557
Good shape.

1025
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,590
Cream.

1026
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,478
Hynky, I'm going to make this
very simple.

1027
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,274
You agree not to invade Osterlich,

1028
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,039
I agree not to invade Osterlich.

1029
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,794
We sign, then I remove
my troops from the border.

1030
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,877
When your troops
are gone, I sign.

1031
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,109
That's-a right.

1032
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,636
Just a minute,
you don't understand.

1033
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,633
First we sign,
then I remove-a da troops.

1034
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,713
- Precisely. I sign after.
- Just a minute.

1035
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,873
Hey, Spook, treaty.

1036
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,436
Hold-a dis.

1037
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,237
Now, look, you sign-a
dis treaty first.

1038
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,550
Then I remove my troops after.

1039
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,955
Why are we arguing?

1040
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,519
You said I remove first.

1041
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,791
I can't sign while they're there.

1042
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,235
- I won't remove them till you sign.
- Why not?

1043
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:51,238
- Why should I?
- Osterlich is a free country!

1044
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,078
Your soldiers are there.

1045
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,635
And they'll stay until you sign.

1046
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,114
I'll blow them off.

1047
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,512
This won't get us anywhere.

1048
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,350
To quote an old Latin phrase...

1049
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,190
Strawberries!

1050
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,120
Where's-a my sandwich?
Another one!

1051
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,879
I don't get this treatment
in my own joint!

1052
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,230
Can't we discuss this
without passion?

1053
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,750
I'm not-a passionate. I'm just...

1054
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:19,996
I want him to sign the treaty.

1055
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,710
What would my people think,
signing such a treaty

1056
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,911
when your soldiers
are on the border?

1057
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,912
I won't move until you sign!

1058
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,674
Not until you clear the border
will I sign!

1059
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,870
Then they remain.

1060
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,155
Then I kick them off.

1061
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,750
One move from you and my artillery
will blow you to pieces!

1062
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,510
And my aeroplanes will bomb
your artillery like that!

1063
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,631
You want-a start a world war?

1064
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,229
You and the world
I'll throw in the ocean!

1065
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,111
Strawberries!

1066
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,391
Your Excellency, we have...

1067
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,590
I got-a my guns here in the pass

1068
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,030
and I'll blow him to pieces.

1069
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:37,236
What's the matter? What ails you?

1070
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:38,989
This isn't like you.

1071
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:42,357
Hey, Garbitsch, come here.

1072
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,279
What's with Hynky?

1073
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,039
Mustard on his strawberries.

1074
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,035
What else can you expect
from Hynky?

1075
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,831
My little bambino!

1076
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:12,630
The Bacterian...

1077
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:13,830
Tomainia...

1078
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,436
You cannot treat Bacteria this way.

1079
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:21,872
I'll take the Bacterian people
and tear them apart, like this!

1080
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:25,510
Look what he's doing!
It's an insult to my people!

1081
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,389
He's-a tearing spaghetti!

1082
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,671
He sign-a the treaty
or we have a war!

1083
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,953
Give me a-something!
Quick, give me a-something!

1084
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,070
- I have an appointment.
- What's this?

1085
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:44,589
Press.
How's the conference progressing?

1086
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,155
Very successfully.
How did you get in?

1087
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,193
How did he get here?

1088
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,911
You know the regulations
about reporters.

1089
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:57,954
No one is to enter the palace
under any circumstances, understand?

1090
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:04,870
There are minor details
to be cleaned up...

1091
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,798
Excuse me, we're busy.

1092
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,154
The whole world
will know we're fighting!

1093
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,555
- So what?
- Can't we come to an agreement?

1094
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,710
When he signs.

1095
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,830
I sign nothing.

1096
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,588
I must speak to you alone.
Do you mind?

1097
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,239
Mind? I don't mind!

1098
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,913
Sign! Sign!

1099
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,155
He'll have the advantage.

1100
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,317
It's a mere scrap of paper.

1101
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,309
When his troops are off the border,
we can move in.

1102
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,916
I'll sign.

1103
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,957
What? Hold-a this.

1104
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:43,630
Ah, my little Hynky!
My dictator brother!

1105
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,876
I knew we have-a no trouble.

1106
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,758
Two prisoners
escaped in officers' uniforms.

1107
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,430
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped.

1108
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,112
The planes are searching for us.

1109
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,230
The woods.

1110
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,750
No, the open.
The border's that way.

1111
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,716
The invasion of Osterlich.

1112
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,275
Now or never.

1113
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:34,869
Ducks.

1114
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,394
Did you hear that?

1115
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,870
It came from over there.

1116
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,400
A yodeler.
Where did you get that outfit?

1117
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,591
- What?
- Don't answer back!

1118
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,477
Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, eh?

1119
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,109
- He will when we get him to camp.
- Come on.

1120
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,591
There it is.
The village of Pretzelburg.

1121
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,234
If we can pass through there
we're safe.

1122
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,430
Through the woods?

1123
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:31,632
They're swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.

1124
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,073
If you see anyone,
don't look right or left.

1125
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,874
We must bluff our way through.

1126
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:39,829
Here they come.

1127
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,079
Can you see what they're doing?

1128
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,839
- Looking this way.
- Keep going!

1129
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:01,434
They're following us. Shall we run?

1130
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:02,874
Certainly not.

1131
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:03,950
Just a little bit?

1132
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,389
Keep walking!

1133
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:09,152
We could walk faster.

1134
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,554
Make up your mind.

1135
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:23,989
Slow down?

1136
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,713
- No!
- There's no hurry.

1137
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,109
He's here!

1138
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,596
Sound assembly!

1139
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,589
Attention!

1140
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,555
Present arms!

1141
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,749
Turn back?

1142
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,234
No, keep going!

1143
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,432
Hail Hynkel!

1144
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,480
Your Excellency,
everything is under control.

1145
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,029
- Good.
- Good.

1146
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,596
I have been in communication
with Marshal Herring in Osterlich.

1147
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:13,509
The route is well guarded. Behind us
are 200 tanks, 50 armored cars

1148
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,438
and 500 machine-guns.

1149
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,754
- Good.
- Good.

1150
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,393
Are we ready to start?

1151
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,589
- Yes.
- Yes.

1152
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,234
Gentlemen.

1153
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,960
Schultz,
I'm happy you're with us again.

1154
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,195
Thank you.

1155
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:40,950
Where are we going?

1156
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:43,191
You're invading Osterlich.

1157
01:49:57,640 --> 01:49:59,232
They're coming.

1158
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:53,956
Your Excellency.

1159
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,636
The world awaits your words.

1160
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,871
What's happened?
He looks strange.

1161
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:31,633
What's Schultz doing here?

1162
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:32,869
Pardoned, I suppose.

1163
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,197
His Excellency Herr Garbitsch,

1164
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:04,153
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda...

1165
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,877
<i>Corona veniet delectis.</i>

1166
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,196
Victory shall come to the worthy.

1167
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,918
Today, democracy, liberty
and equality

1168
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,878
are words to fool the people.

1169
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,515
No nation
can progress with such ideas.

1170
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,309
They stand in the way of action.
Therefore, we abolish them.

1171
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:30,398
In the future, each man will serve
the state with absolute obedience.

1172
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:32,477
Let him who refuses beware!

1173
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,709
Citizenship will be taken away
from all Jews and non-Aryans.

1174
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,037
They are inferior and therefore
enemies of the state.

1175
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,676
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1176
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:47,473
This nation
is annexed to the Tomainian Empire,

1177
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:51,190
and the people will obey the laws
bestowed on us by our great leader,

1178
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:56,508
the Dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich,

1179
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,429
the future Emperor of the World!

1180
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,993
You must speak.

1181
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:05,310
I can't.

1182
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:08,194
You must. It's our only hope.

1183
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,909
Hope...

1184
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,231
I'm sorry
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1185
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,953
That's not my business.

1186
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,829
I don't want to rule
or conquer anyone.

1187
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,672
I should like to help everyone:

1188
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:11,032
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1189
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:14,471
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1190
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,638
We want to live by each other's
happiness, not misery.

1191
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,070
We don't want to hate one another.

1192
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:21,554
In this world,

1193
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:25,110
the good earth is rich
and can provide for everyone.

1194
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:28,039
The way of life can be free
and beautiful

1195
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,072
but we have lost the way.

1196
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,709
Greed has poisoned men's souls,

1197
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,911
has barricaded the world with hate,

1198
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,839
has goose-stepped us into bloodshed.

1199
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,117
We have developed speed
but have shut ourselves in.

1200
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,994
Machinery has left us in want.

1201
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,955
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness, hard and unkind.

1202
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,754
We think too much
and feel too little.

1203
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,395
More than machinery
we need humanity.

1204
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:56,911
More than cleverness
we need kindness and gentleness.

1205
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:01,079
Without these qualities, life will
be violent and all will be lost...

1206
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:03,709
The aeroplane and radio
have brought us closer.

1207
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,878
These inventions cry out
for the goodness in man,

1208
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,118
cry out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1209
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:13,153
Even now
my voice is reaching millions,

1210
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:16,352
millions of despairing men,
women and children,

1211
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:19,034
victims of a system
that makes men torture

1212
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:21,311
and imprison innocent people.

1213
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,637
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1214
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,832
The misery upon us
is but the passing of greed,

1215
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:31,436
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1216
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:34,712
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die,

1217
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,197
and the power they took
will return to the people.

1218
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,234
So long as men die
liberty will never perish.

1219
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,874
Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes,

1220
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:47,991
men who despise you, enslave you,

1221
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:51,755
regiment your lives,
tell you what to think and feel,

1222
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,834
who drill you, treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder.

1223
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:58,554
Don't give yourselves to these men,

1224
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,997
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts.

1225
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:05,716
You are not machines,
you are not cattle, you are men!

1226
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,956
You have
the love of humanity in you.

1227
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:11,909
Don't hate. Only the unloved
and the unnatural hate.

1228
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,351
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery,
fight for liberty!

1229
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:19,030
St Luke says, "The Kingdom of God
is within man."

1230
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,630
Not in one man nor a group of men,
but in all men. In you!

1231
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:26,071
You have the power
to create machines,

1232
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,633
the power to create happiness.

1233
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:31,117
You have the power to make
this life free and beautiful,

1234
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,430
to make this life
a wonderful adventure.

1235
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:36,473
In the name of democracy,
let us use that power.

1236
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:40,150
Let us all unite,
let us fight for a new world,

1237
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,113
a world
that will give men a chance to work,

1238
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:46,153
that will give youth a future
and old age security.

1239
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:49,079
Promising these things,
brutes have risen.

1240
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:52,750
But they lie! They do not fulfill
that promise. They never will!

1241
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,510
Dictators free themselves
but they enslave the people.

1242
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,553
Now let us fight
to fulfill that promise!

1243
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:03,833
Let us fight to free the world,
to do away with national barriers,

1244
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:07,430
to do away with greed,
with hate and intolerance.

1245
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,636
Let us fight for a world of reason,

1246
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:14,198
a world where science and progress
will lead to the happiness of all.

1247
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,749
Soldiers, in the name of democracy,

1248
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,678
let us unite!

1249
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,515
Hannah,

1250
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,953
can you hear me?

1251
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:50,635
Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.

1252
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:55,558
The clouds are lifting,
the sun is breaking through.

1253
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,913
We are coming out of the darkness

1254
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:01,550
into a new world,

1255
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,438
a kindlier world,

1256
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,196
where men will rise
above their hate, their greed

1257
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:08,833
and their brutality.

1258
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,033
Look up, Hannah.

1259
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:15,836
The soul of man
has been given wings.

1260
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,756
He is flying into the rainbow,

1261
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,157
into the light of hope,
into the future,

1262
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:25,750
the glorious future
that belongs to you,

1263
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,838
to me and to all of us.

1264
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,799
Look up, Hannah. Look up!

1265
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,873
Did you hear that?

1266
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,149
Listen...
