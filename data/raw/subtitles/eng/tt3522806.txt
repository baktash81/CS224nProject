Five months in Brazil.

00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,793

9
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,883
You even have the accent right.

10
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,306
I do say so.

11
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,517
The principal I represent
has an offer for you.

12
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:46,394
He would like three men killed.

13
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,897
Each death must look like an accident.

14
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,523
Your specialty, I believe.

15
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:57,906
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

16
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,243
My principal could make that known
to certain interested parties.

17
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:08,583
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.

18
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,587
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.

19
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,590
What's your pleasure,
Senor Otto Santos?

20
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,220
Let me make a call.

21
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,058
What are you doing?

22
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,313
Tell your principal it never pays
to fuck with the dead.

- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.

38
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,242
You're different.

39
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,619
Older.

40
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,872
Um, something more than that.

41
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,000
I need time to find someone
before they find me.

42
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,252
Then I'll be moving on.

43
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,004
Who else is here?

44
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,840
No one. Diving season's over.

45
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,175
Come.

46
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,010
Your home's waiting for you.

47
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,762
How was your trip?

48
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,221
[Bishop] It was okay.

49
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,268
[Mei]
It was a busy season.

50
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:22,730
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.

51
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,698
Nothing's changed.

52
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:33,991
Get some rest.

53
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:46,981
[speaking Thai]

54
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,462
Hi. How can I help you?

55
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,796
Great, you speak English.

56
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,215
Um, I'm running low on first aid.

57
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm staying on a boat.

58
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,011
Sure.

59
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,558
This is all I have.

60
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,477
Thanks.

61
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,694
If I don't have what you need,
I can call our supply boat.

62
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,864
They can take you back
to Phuket to get it.

63
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:41,035
No, this is great.
Thanks so much.

64
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,203
Anytime.

[Mei sighing]

74
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,748
I've met her.
She has a backbone.

75
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,043
Women like that
get killed in these situations.

76
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,712
Domestic squabble, Mei.

77
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,339
Not my business.

78
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,426
You helped me once.

79
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,595
Help her.

80
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,181
Or I will do it.

81
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,063
Hold this.

82
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,856
[fight continues]

83
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,475
[woman]
Frank, get the fuck away from me!

84
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,561
Frank!

85
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,812
Not worth it.

86
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,857
- [groans]
- Bitch.

87
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,029
Let her go.

88
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,530
[Frank]
Who the fuck are you?

89
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,115
Please, help me.

90
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,329
I said, let her go. Last chance.

91
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,372
Let go of me, Frank.

92
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:51,498
You don't want to do that.

93
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,292
Fuck you!

00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,460

96
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:12,853
[woman] Is he dead?

97
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,362
[Mei] Bishop.

98
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,450
Shit.

99
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,874
Take her ashore.
I'll deal with the boat.

100
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,042
Okay.

101
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,681
[gun cocks]

102
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,655
- Bishop.
- Where is she?

103
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,449
Sleeping. In your bungalow.

104

[door opens and shuts]

105
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,334
What's going on?

106
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,004
Gina Thornton. American.

107
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,964
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.

108
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,426
You're the second woman
who has my picture in her phone.

109
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,511
The first was working
for a guy called Crain.

110
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,847
Name ring a bell?

111
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,767
The only thing
you got right was my name.

112
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,393
The first woman was a messenger.

113
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,688
Is that what you are?

114
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,732
So what's the message?

115
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,025
I already told you...

116
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,777
Tell me about Crain.

117
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,320
What are you supposed to do for him?

118
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,571
Where is he?

119
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,239
[both grunting]

120
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,286
Fine. I'll talk.

121
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,213
[sighs]
Look... I don't work for Crain.

122
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,757
That's the truth.
But he did send me.

123
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,717
Where is he?

124
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,761
- I don't know.
- Why are you here?

125
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,348
He has something on me.

126
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,599
I had no choice.

127
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,184
Right.

128
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,894
Any of his men nearby?

129
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,521
He didn't say, I didn't ask.

130
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,356
What about Frank?

131
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,482
Part of the setup.

132
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,818
Explain.

133
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,905
He was supposed to get me,
and I escaped to this island.

134
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,532
It wasn't meant to be real.

135
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,951
But then Frank got drunk
and attacked me.

136
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,245
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.

137
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,871
And get next to me?

138
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,249
Yeah.

139
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,417
But Frank took his part too far.

140
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,128
So we meet. What next?

141
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,923
I use the cell and call
the pre-programmed number.

142
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,009
Let it ring once.
After that, I don't know.

143
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,179
My new girl gets kidnapped is what.

144
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,597
What?

145
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,474
The thought didn't cross your mind?

146
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,399
Okay, so you fall for me,
and Crain thinks he has leverage on you.

147
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,984
Why?

148
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,528
Well, to force me to do something
I don't want to do.

149
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,906
What is it that you do?

150
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,450
I'll make the call, not you.
I choose when they come.

151
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,536
Then I'll take Crain out.

152
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,039
No. I'm not going to
help you kill anyone.

153
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,958
Do you really believe that Crain

154
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,586
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him live?

155
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,591
I've spent my whole life
setting people up to die.

156
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,468
I can set you up to live.

157
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,110
[sighs]

158
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,328
My father was a doctor
of Eastern medicine.

159
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,787
He was a healer.

160
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,957
Bishop used to study with him.

161
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,460
To learn how to heal?

162
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,087
A man like him?

163
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,547
I thought so, too.

164
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,135
But my father understood

165
00:18:55,218 --> 00:19:00,974
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.

166

<i>After my last deployment,
I just needed a change.</i>

170

<i>Too many innocent people

175

<i>And, um, I felt like I can maybe
do something good with my life.</i>

176
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,832
I can't afford any surprises.

177
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,584
Need to know what Crain has on you.

178
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,094
I run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in Cambodia.

179
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:05,223
There's always been an issue or two,
but I've managed to handle it.

180
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:12,481
A few weeks ago,
one of my staff members was kidnapped.

181
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,986
Two days later, she was
thrown off a truck at my front door.

182
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,989
Beaten. Died within an hour.

183
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,662
Crain sent this asshole, Jeremy,

I had to do what Crain wanted me to.

- Krill.

367
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:10,386
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the Sudanese militia.

368
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,347
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.

369

Some have relatives who want revenge.

371
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,858
He used to be Krill's best assassin.

372

Now all he wants to do is kill him.

373

Come in, my friend.

386
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:11,984
There are six murders

388
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:17,489
Most of them pointed at me.

389

That guy you stopped,
he used to work for me.

Oh.

391
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,624

393
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:36,258

I hear things.

My juju tells me everything
that I need to hear.

399
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,400
Maybe you weren't listening hard enough.

400
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,073
Do you know who I am?

401
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,618
Krill.

402
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,037
You run this place.

403
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,497
Exactly.

404
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:13,003
And when I get out of this place,
I'm going to run all of Africa.

405
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,756
There could be a job

<i>I'm okay.</i>

It belonged to his father.

You know your problem, Bishop?
You just can't help yourself.

570
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,552
That's how I knew
you'd come back for her.

571
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,847
That's your weakness.

572
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:54,683
Now do the third kill,
or the girl's dead.

573
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:59,396
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.

another stunt like that,</i>

<i>our deal is off, and you'll never
see your little girlfriend again.</i>

580
01:06:07,298 --> 01:06:10,467
<i>Now playtime's over.</i>

581
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:18,017

01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:28,360
<i>His name is Max Adams,
a wealthy American arms dealer.</i>

586
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:39,455
<i>On the north side of Varna,
you'll find a truly vulgar memorial</i>

587
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:41,290
<i>to Bulgarian communism...</i>

588
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:44,043
<i>Adams spent a fortune restoring it</i>

589
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:47,212
<i>and putting in the most
comprehensive security system.</i>

<i>Adams stocks his U-boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.</i>

595
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,990
<i>Nobody gets in or out.
Many have died trying.</i>

596
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:20,245
<i>So, needless to say, this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far.</i>

597

<i>On top of all that, Krill and Cook's
deaths may have Adams on the defense.</i>

<i>You have 24 hours.</i>

599
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:50,734

[guard on intercom]
<i>No sign of the intruder, Mr. Adams.</i>

631
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:25,610
That's because he's sitting
right in front of me

632
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:28,053
here in the safe room, jackoff.

633
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:33,767
Magnificent.
Even if it is all stolen and looted.

634
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,769
Cubo-futurist totalitarianism.

635
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:40,148
Of course it's magnificent.
Like, uh, dinosaur bones.

636
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:41,400
It's ugly.

637
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:44,695
Who the fuck are you?

638
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:46,280
I'm here to talk.

639
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:48,073
Lose your cell phone?

640
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:50,742
I should've hired
those guys from Houston.

641
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:52,595
All right, what is it
that you want to talk about?

642
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:55,289
I want to help you avoid an accident.

643
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:58,375
Krill, Cook, that was you.

644
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,712
I warned those guys that one day Crain
would come after all of us.

645
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,297
Cappuccino? Espresso?

646
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,173
Espresso. No sugar.

647
01:13:05,257 --> 01:13:06,842
[coffee machine whirs]

648
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:11,972
Krill was a warlord, but also the
number-one arms dealer in Africa.

649
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:15,767
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise.

650
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:18,812
You have got Europe
and most of South America.

651
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:22,107
North America, too,
if you count Mexicans.

652
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:23,692
That didn't leave much for Crain.

653
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:26,320
So I have a deal for you.

654
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:30,407
Hmm. Well, I'm a dealer.

655
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,867
We can talk about it.

656
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,978
[Adams] I've been called
a lot of ugly names over the years,

657
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:45,005
Communist, socialist, racist, fascist...

658
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,174
None of which is true, of course.

659
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,258
Well...

660
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:51,678
...I'm certainly not a communist.

661
01:13:51,762 --> 01:13:54,473
[Bishop] You just admire
their architecture.

662
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:56,099
[Adams] I believe in fair play.

663
01:13:56,183 --> 01:14:00,812
I saw the David and Goliath story
play out on the frontlines of Vietnam.

664
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:04,649
Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

665
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:06,568
Chemical weapons on the Kurds.

666
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,738
The little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot,

667
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:11,948
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.

668
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:15,369
An arms dealer with a moral clause.

669
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:16,703
Mmm-hmm.

670
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:21,208
Let's talk about Crain.
We both need him gone.

671
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:24,628
The question is, how do we accomplish
that? He's got an army around him.

672
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:28,256
We need something tempting enough so
that Crain uses his men to go after it.

673
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:33,387
- What do you have in mind?
- Your submarine pen.

674
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,265
Have them search
for weapons, treasure...

675
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:38,517
Your corpse.

676
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:40,477
What?

677
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,563
You'll have to die.

678
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:45,357
Well, that's easy.

679
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,484
Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.

680
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:50,153
You can afford it.

681
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,874
[indistinct chatter]

682
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,418
[Adams]
Are the boats all secured?

683
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,128
[engineer] Yes, sir.

684
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,106
- [Adams] Batteries charged?
- [engineer] Yes, sir.

685
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,340
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.

686
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:12,485
You get those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?

687
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:13,552
Yes, sir.

688
01:15:13,635 --> 01:15:15,846
Well, looks like we're ready to go.

689
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:19,558
[beeping]

690
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,313
Stay here.

691
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:29,151
[rapid beeping]

692
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:58,847
[engineer] <i>There was an explosion,
and Mr. Adams fell into the water.</i>

693
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,767
<i>His security, they tried to reach him,
but the rocks came down,</i>

694
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:06,062
<i>and he was buried under the water.
Gone.</i>

695
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,067
[gasping]

696
01:16:11,902 --> 01:16:13,612
[sighs]
Oh, my God.

697
01:16:15,155 --> 01:16:20,160
I never imagined that dying would be
so goddamn invigorating.

698
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:21,953
Stay out of sight for two days.

699
01:16:22,037 --> 01:16:24,372
After that, you can
invigorate all you want.

700
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:25,916
[panting]

701
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,773
You calling for the driver?

702
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:52,108
Making dinner reservations?

703
01:16:52,192 --> 01:16:53,818
Checking in with Mom?

704
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,904
I'm calling Crain
to make sure he takes the bait.

705
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:57,155
[cell phone buzzes]

706
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:06,540
You do know how to put on a show.

707
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:08,291
There's a pier
a few miles north of Varna.

708
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:10,544
Be there tomorrow with the girl.

709
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:12,754
Not until I see Adams' body.

710
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:16,174
You'll find him
with his most prized possessions.

711
01:17:16,258 --> 01:17:17,801
<i>In his submarine pen.</i>

712
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,478
Get over there. Find Adams' body.

713
01:17:28,562 --> 01:17:31,189
Secure everything inside the pen.

714
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:33,525
And, uh, what about Bishop?

715
01:17:34,484 --> 01:17:35,777
Kill him.

716
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,187
[Crain] Jeremy, point the camera
forward, so I can see.

717
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,291
[Jeremy]
All right. Let's go. Fan out.

718
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,351
[Crain]
Where the hell is Bishop?

719
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,815
[guard 1]
Sir, it's clear.

720
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,149
[guard 2] 2-1 clear.

721
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:41,945

736
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,075
Go, go, go!

740
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,436
Motherfucker!

741
01:21:12,327 --> 01:21:13,536
Anything?

742
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,789
No sign of him, Mr. Crain.

743
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:21,336
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.

744
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,969
- [Gina] What's going on?
- Your boyfriend's coming to die.

745
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:33,973
And you're the bait. Move!

746
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,620
[guards talking indistinctly]

747
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:05,880
[Crain] Come on, Bishop.

748
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,592
I know you're not going to let her die.

749
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:12,762
[guard shouting]

750
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:19,561
[guard 1] Nothing here.

751
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,279

[grunting]

754
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:53,136
Bring her to the bridge.

755
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:01,519
[groans]

756
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:09,527
Let's move.

[groans]

776
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:08,331
Let's go. We have three minutes
before it blows.

777
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:18,091
[beeping continues]

778
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:20,051
- Gina. You okay?
- [sighs]

779
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,053
I'll be fine.

780
01:26:24,806 --> 01:26:28,059
Let me see. Oh, shit.

781
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:30,103
I saw Crain doing something
on the console.

782
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,023
What's going on?

783
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:35,775
[Bishop]
Crain is trying to kill us.

784
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:37,652
Let's go.

785
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:40,071
Move this shit on the boat, now!

786
01:26:40,154 --> 01:26:41,572
Yes, sir.

787
01:26:41,656 --> 01:26:43,699
[grunting]

788
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:45,701
- What is this?
- Just get in.

789
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:49,580
Wait. What are you doing?

790
01:26:49,664 --> 01:26:50,957
Making sure you live.

791
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,127
No! Come with me! Bishop!

792
01:26:55,378 --> 01:26:57,130
- There he is!
- [Gina] Bishop!

793

- [rapid beeping]
- [grunts]

794
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:06,347
[Crain] Find him. Now!

795
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,182
- Move!
- Fletcher!

796
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,643
Let's get going.

797
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:23,698

[choking]

800
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:26,302
You never asked why.

801
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,221
I know why.

802
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:30,181
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.

803
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:32,683
And here we are again.

804
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:36,729
You deserted me.
It's time you paid for that.

805
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,189
No chance.

806
01:28:39,774 --> 01:28:41,317
You're gonna get your third kill.

807
01:28:43,444 --> 01:28:46,197
But this one won't look like
an accident.

808
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,740
- [metal chain clanks]
- [grunting]

809
01:28:54,664 --> 01:28:55,706

[choking]

811
01:29:38,124 --> 01:29:40,376
You're a dead man, Bishop.

812
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,627
[Crain laughs]

813
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:47,008
You might get off the boat,
but you'll never swim far enough away

814
01:29:47,091 --> 01:29:48,259
before she blows.

815
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,720
Who said I was swimming?

816
01:29:57,518 --> 01:29:58,894
Bishop!

817
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:00,646
[beeping continues]

818
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:04,400
Bishop!

819
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,988
Bishop!

821
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,759
[sobbing and panting]

822
01:30:35,056 --> 01:30:36,349
Hey!

823
01:30:37,808 --> 01:30:39,226
Hey!

824
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:57,953
[sniffles]

825
01:31:03,918 --> 01:31:05,961
Were there any survivors?

826
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:08,964
No.

827
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,182

[speaking Bulgarian]

829
01:31:24,397 --> 01:31:26,399
So Bishop never made it.

830
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:28,150
Even legends die.

831
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:30,236

in Cambodia with the kids.</i>

834
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,845
<i>The water filter's working.</i>

835
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:58,597
<i>Thank you so much
for your generous gift.</i>

836
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,516
<i>You have to come here someday.</i>

837
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,602
<i>I think you'd like it a lot.</i>

838
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:08,524
<i>Bishop would have loved it.
See you soon. I hope.</i>

839
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:11,569
<i>Lots of love, Gina.</i>

840
01:32:11,652 --> 01:32:13,320

[typing]

844
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,284
Clever son of a bitch.

845
01:33:48,457 --> 01:33:49,458
[chuckles]

846
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:03,639
Sneaky bastard.

847
01:34:03,722 --> 01:34:07,643
Bang. You're dead.
[chuckling]
