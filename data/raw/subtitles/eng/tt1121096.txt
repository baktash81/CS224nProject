1
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,192
GREEGORYYY!

2
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,063
HAVE MERCY!

3
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:33,701
Release me!

4
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,440
Gregory! Come baaack!

5
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,299
My power returns with the rise of the Blood Moon.

6
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,992
Hell awakens.

7
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:15,710
- Is Master Gregory here?
- Partially.

8
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,191
Master Gregory, do you not hear the bells?

9
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:31,044
The bells are ringing in my ear.

10
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:36,794
In the village in the old church, there is
a child no more than ten years of age.

11
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:40,763
She is... infected.

12
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:46,352
You may note I am presently
not dealing with the other worldly.

13
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,306
On your feet, sir. Since you're
requested for duty.

14
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,611
My only oath is to this stool.

15
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,066
It's an oath I intend not to break.

16
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,744
The mark on your hand tells me you're a knight.
Have you no honor?

17
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,782
This man says an innocent is at risk.

18
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:09,484
- And you do nothing?
- On the contrary.

19
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,731
I'm doing my best to ignore him.

20
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:16,741
- I beg of you, do not do this.
- Don't worry, boy. This won't be an execution.

21
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:18,733
Merely an education.

22
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,039
Fill it.

23
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,324
I was begging for your life. Not his.

24
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,103
The trick is not to feeding him with a cup.

25
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:56,591
The trick is not to spill.

26
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,472
Thank you!

27
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:05,311
Mr. Bradley, why you do not tell me
the bells are ringing?

28
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,856
Apologies, Master.

29
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,444
Come! Quickly!

30
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:32,926
Hatchet.

31
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,082
Silverbane.

32
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,022
Longbow.

33
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,162
We'll need the silver net.

34
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,548
Please, save her.

35
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:56,204
Nothing else will hold her.

36
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:01,794
- How long has she been like this?
- Since last evening.

37
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:08,154
Come to me.

38
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:12,395
Come to me!

39
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:17,552
You has to know - when you put me in that hole ...

40
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:21,185
...you can't hold me there forever....

41
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,663
...Gregory.

42
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:28,940
If it is really you, show yourself.

43
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:33,941
Leave this innocent child!

44
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,995
Mommy! What happened?

45
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,748
God bless you.

46
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:24,600
Did you miss me?

47
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:32,047
You have, haven't you? Don't try to deny it.

48
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,140
I can see it to your soul.

49
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:40,969
Oh! My boy...

50
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,948
- I like boys.
- Shut your eyes.

51
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,849
Come here, boy.

52
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,800
Do not be an [...], it'll lower your power.

53
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,667
William!

54
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,794
You know something, Gregory?

55
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,745
I missed you too.

56
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,092
NO!

57
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,016
Shoot!

58
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:20,782
Net!

59
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,359
Well done, William!

60
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,651
We will work together!

61
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,820
Let the silver do it's work!

62
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,990
Can you feel it? She's weakening!

63
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:04,022
[...], William!

64
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,664
No!

65
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,835
I'm sorry, Master.

66
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:32,864
<i>- Let him go.
- Why would I?</i>

67
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,410
- Master Gregory!
- Release him.

68
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:39,414
Don't expect sympathy from him.
His heart's blacker than mine.

69
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,385
You're with me now.

70
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,322
- Let him go!
- I can feel the dark. - NO!

71
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,973
- I cannot stand it.
- Let him go, or I'll burn you!

72
00:09:55,059 --> 00:10:00,646
Master Gregory! MASTER GREGORY!

73
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:07,758
Time has made me stronger.
I'm no longer as easy to contain.

74
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,641
Ten damn years wasted.

75
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:38,296
I'm coming for you, Malkin!

76
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:44,559
I AM COMING FOR YOU!

77
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:12,979
Tom!

78
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,390
What is it, Cate?

79
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,809
You are supposed to be minding the pigs.

80
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:28,958
- You've never had one.
- No, but I'm getting closer.

81
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:34,151
- You're not a hunter, Tom. - I'm not destined
to spend the rest of my life feeding pigs.

82
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,007
I gonna get outta here, Cate.

83
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,868
Gonna leave this place soon, I just ...

84
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,974
- ...I know it.
- Tom, you are shaking.

85
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:54,003
Go get Mom, Cate. Go!

86
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,251
Mom, it's happening again.

87
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,891
Tom. Tom!

88
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,984
Go catch those pigs, or your father
will have you for dinner.

89
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,133
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come on.

90
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,302
The Ward residence?

91
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,263
Who is asking?

92
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:14,280
I understand there is a seventh
son of the seventh son - that lives here.

93
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:18,383
Do not say there is not, for I know that there is.
I'm in a hurry.

94
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,651
Bit hungry as well.

95
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:38,433
My compliments to the cook.

96
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:40,377
You're welcome.

97
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,210
So ...

98
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,575
Which one is the seventh?

99
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:09,124
What is your name, boy?

100
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:11,694
Thomas Ward.

101
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:22,500
He is strong. Does a lot of work
around the farm.

102
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,180
The deeming has begun.

103
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,460
That's the man... from my visions.

104
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,500
It's too dangerous.

105
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,780
- He is a Spook.
- It is a noble profession.

106
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:57,242
And your last apprentice, and the one before him?
What happened to them?

107
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,302
- And now you come here for my son?
- I'm supposed to go with him.

108
00:15:10,153 --> 00:15:13,540
He's a bit scrawny for a seventh son.

109
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,732
I dreaded the thought of this day...

110
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,575
...but I knew it would come.

111
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:43,396
Then you understand.

112
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,751
I know you better than you think I do, Tom.

113
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:50,761
Be wise.

114
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,166
Be careful.

115
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:07,840
Remember - all you ever need, is inside you.

116
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,099
Just don't be afraid to look.

117
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,410
The pendant. That I can't take...

118
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:21,705
Wear it.

119
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:23,870
Always.

120
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,840
Keep him safe!

121
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,733
Alas, good lady. That is a vow I cannot make.

122
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
My Queen.

123
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:37,960
- At last, you have returned.
- The Spook. What has he done to you?

124
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:42,080
Not just me. All of us.

125
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:47,240
Burned. Starved. And forced into hiding.

126
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:52,320
The Spook has no mercy.

127
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:00,099
My spial follows him.

128
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:14,362
You need not fear Gregory any longer,
my beauuutiful sissster.

129
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,160
Thank you, my Queen.

130
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,678
Make way. Make way!

131
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:40,252
It is near impossible to battle demons
with wet feet.

132
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,379
Here.

133
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,320
This is to beat your boots paced.

134
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,160
I will pick up provisions.

135
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,200
- Provisions?
- Liquids.

136
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,539
Need it to ward off evil spirits.

137
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:54,954
Fermented liquids?

138
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:59,733
If I forget, pick up grease, salt, flour and bacon.

139
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:05,743
Starting to Wish I was the sixth son.

140
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,184
Burn that witch!

141
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:37,403
Wait!

142
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,622
If she is a witch, then I count it off with her.

143
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,720
Who are you?!

144
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,736
I am Master Gregory's apprentice.

145
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,240
It's true, I saw The Spook going into the tavern.

146
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:52,440
And in my expert opinion...

147
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,520
...she is extremely dangerous.

148
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,820
- Shall we touch your master?
- No, no. I can take her away and dispose her.

149
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,683
But I'll need salt, flour and grease!

150
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,721
And throw in some bacon as payment.

151
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:20,920
So what are you going
to do with me, Mr. Apprentice?

152
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,255
I'm not sure yet.

153
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:26,725
- You don't believe that I'm a witch?
- You don't look like a witch.

154
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:29,600
Do you really think you'll make it as a Spook?

155
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,270
That's the idea.

156
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,225
You seem too nice.

157
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,526
You know that all of his apprentices
were killed, don't you?

158
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:52,437
What's your name?

159
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,121
- Tom, what's yours?
- I'll tell you next time.

160
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,901
- Next time?
- I read fortunes.

161
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,523
We will meet again. Just don't tell
your master about me.

162
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:09,545
Why not?

163
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:14,420
You don't like secrets?

164
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,773
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

165
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:26,073
Just... close your eyes.

166
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,620
Mother?

167
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:30,540
Yes, it's me.

168
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:33,751
- How is it possible? You look ...
- Is this your daughter?

169
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:42,940
Are you a loyal girl? Like your mother?

170
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,660
So this is your spy that follows Gregory.

171
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,300
I like her shoes.

172
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,100
A human father.

173
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,221
Lizzie, you surprise me.

174
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:11,857
Help yourself to the blood cakes, little one.
They give you strength.

175
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,966
Soon the Blood Moon will be full.

176
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:23,824
And as it grows stronger, so do all of us.
We must call the others.

177
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,520
Pendel Mountain welcomes you, brothers and sisters.

178
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,400
Your Queen has returned.

179
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,335
Do not dally, Mr. Ward.

180
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,068
What kind of forest is this?

181
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,974
When you address me - address me
as Master Gregory.

182
00:24:55,982 --> 00:25:00,380
So, um... Master Gregory... if, um...
if I'm your new apprentice ...

183
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,273
...what happened to the old one?
- Wrong question.

184
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:06,500
Wrong questions, get wrong answers.

185
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,925
So he's dead.

186
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:17,770
It's just a Gast. Level six creature.

187
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:20,548
These woods are filled with them.

188
00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:23,706
Try not to upset it, he'll leaves you alone.

189
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:36,332
What do you know of what a... Spook actually done?

190
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,539
You kill creatures of the dark.

191
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:47,769
Your answer... could fill me with confidence.

192
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,209
We deal with creatures of the dark.

193
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,940
Some are less harmful, such as Gasts.

194
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,034
The most dangerous, such as witches,
we trap or kill.

195
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,380
My last apprentice wrote this all down.

196
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:05,547
Yeah, he's dead.

197
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,509
Well, I - I'm just saying, maybe he
didn't do everything right?

198
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:16,780
William Bradley was the finest apprentice I've ever had.

199
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,100
He died at the hands of Mother Malkin.

200
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,700
The Witch Queen? Thought she was just a legend.

201
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,580
You live in the world now, where
legend and nightmare are real.

202
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,600
Malkin is alive.

203
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,222
We journey to her fortress in Pendel Mountain,
where she no doubt hides.

204
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:36,628
Mr Ward!

205
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,380
You passed out.

206
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:55,540
You've spells, boy. What kind?

207
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,659
Sometimes I...

208
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,700
...I see things.

209
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,599
Things that haven't happened yet.

210
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,436
Could be of use, too.

211
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,260
Not the passing out part of course,
but the visions. Perhaps.

212
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:22,651
- What is that?
- You mean "who".

213
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,691
This is Tusk. As loyal as he is ugly.

214
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,720
These things that you see in your visions ...

215
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,127
...can you alter them or they are fixed?

216
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:45,440
I... I don't know. I am merely trying.

217
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:51,800
With a little help... most of life's curses can be a gift.

218
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,440
Here are my beauties. Returned, as I knew
they would.

219
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,456
Tend of them, Tusk.

220
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:14,175
- What is this place?
- Home Sweet Home.

221
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,272
This is incredible.

222
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:27,303
We must arm ourselves for the
journey to Pendel Mountain.

223
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:28,954
Come, Mr Ward.

224
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:41,396
The Falcons.

225
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:47,189
An order of noble knights who dedicated
to combating the forces of darkness...

226
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,671
...and responsible for passing their knowledge and
skills to other seventh sons of seventh sons.

227
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,030
It... it says here that there are thousands of you.

228
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,002
That is a very old tapestry.

229
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:05,748
They all died or returned to darkness.

230
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:13,106
When you deal with dark, dark gets in you.

231
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:17,763
So... you're the only one left?

232
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,493
So you are the only one left, Master Gregory?

233
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:33,089
Thank you... for reminding me.

234
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:42,514
- How long does this apprenticeship suppose to last?
- Ten years.

235
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,640
For my last apprentice.

236
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:50,140
But for you, I have less than one week.

237
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:54,110
- Why so short?
- That is when the Blood Moon will be full.

238
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,565
Happens once a century.

239
00:29:57,871 --> 00:30:01,575
The last time it started many years of war.

240
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:06,056
Witches laid waste to cities.
The world is still recovering.

241
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:13,206
If we do not stop Mother Malkin,
before the next Red Moon sets...

242
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:17,088
- How can we... possibly...
- Enough. No more questions.

243
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:20,442
We leave at dawn. Stay in your chamber.

244
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:23,887
Master Gregory, If you want me to learn,
you have to explain things.

245
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:28,336
No time. We must get to Pendel Mountain
before Malkin sends her dominion.

246
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,312
There are witches that need killing.

247
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,267
Keen witches.

248
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:59,064
Help me.

249
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:10,431
Heeeelp meeeee...

250
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:14,796
Help.

251
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,783
You were told to stay in your chamber!

252
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:26,508
That was your first test, Mr. Ward.
And not surprisingly, you FAILED!

253
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,657
Test number two:

254
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:35,124
The Rowan staff. Cut by the first Falcon-Knight.

255
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,996
Finest fighting staff there is.

256
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:43,160
Master it, then can you master any weapon.

257
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,801
Show what you are!

258
00:33:49,547 --> 00:33:54,327
I paid good money for you. I think your father
deceived me of your worth.

259
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,916
Are not you the seventh son of the seventh son?!

260
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:01,945
You ought to be seven times as strong
as a normal man!

261
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:07,792
Your Mom... she did not put much of a fight
to keep you, did she?

262
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:22,535
You're worthless.

263
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:25,719
There is not enough time. You'll be dead in a week.

264
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,170
Good aim.

265
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:36,646
I was aiming for your head.

266
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,380
Missed.

267
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,385
Teach me.

268
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,119
Please.

269
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,019
To the Blood Moon's rise and Malkin's arrival...

270
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:59,386
...the creatures of the dark will be
more frequent and more powerful.

271
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,070
These are her lieutenants.

272
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:05,782
This is Radu. He has an army of assassins.

273
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:14,098
Throw the knife.

274
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:18,399
Go.

275
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:27,186
Salt. And iron. They are crucial.

276
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,837
Salt glows, iron leads away the strength
of any creature of the dark.

277
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,326
Tincture of copper, for flesh wounds.

278
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:37,289
Silverbane, repels witches.

279
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:42,832
Ogre scrotum. For your own enjoyment. Follow.

280
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:48,738
- Stone chuckers, they not to be confused
with cattle rippers. - What's the difference?

281
00:35:49,704 --> 00:35:53,292
Stone chuckers chuck stones,
cattle rippers rip cattle.

282
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,227
They names are fairly self-evident.

283
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:12,295
Verbanum. Guards against spells.

284
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:18,117
- That is disgusting. What does that kill?
- Cowardice.

285
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:24,053
Sarakin, takes the form of a leopard.
Virahadra is the king of swords.

286
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:33,722
You consistency is admirable, Mr. Ward.

287
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:40,261
Of all of them, Malkin is the strongest.

288
00:36:40,341 --> 00:36:41,898
She is the Queen.

289
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:45,971
You know, I've seen... Mother Malkin
in my visions.

290
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:50,759
This gonna take a lot more than... salt
and iron to defeat her.

291
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,246
You leave Malkin to me.

292
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,269
Continue your studies.

293
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,388
My Queen!

294
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,366
A gift to commemorate your return.

295
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:26,293
My finest assassins.

296
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:31,442
Radu... you spoil me.

297
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:35,727
You must keep your gifts.
You will need them more than I.

298
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,574
Have you forgotten?

299
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:42,802
There are Spooks buried all over this mountain,
who thought they could slay me.

300
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:47,401
When the Blood Moon if full,
Gregory will be the next.

301
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:01,882
Did you forget me?

302
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:10,370
Never, never look at me.

303
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,209
Your finest assassins?

304
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,241
You may keep them.

305
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:30,583
Mother.

306
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:33,224
She is dangerous.

307
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,281
She is my sister.

308
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,435
She healed me, Alice.

309
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:43,742
By the time the Moon is full,
she will rule this land.

310
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,855
And we will be there by her side.

311
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:52,271
No hiding from men. No more fearing them.

312
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:56,876
Just fearing her.

313
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:03,487
I would never let her hurt you.

314
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:08,784
Now go. Keep an eye on that Spook.

315
00:40:00,993 --> 00:40:02,330
What are you doing here?

316
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,640
Swimming, in moonlight.

317
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:13,925
Turn around.

318
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:40,986
What was that?

319
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:45,978
It is said that when a witch
first touches by moonlight...

320
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:48,623
the man with whom she's
meant to walk hand in hand ...

321
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:53,092
...there is a blue spark.

322
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,473
So you are a witch.

323
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:02,683
My father is a gypsy, and my mother is a witch.

324
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:05,002
So that makes me a witch.

325
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,920
She is all I have.

326
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:22,808
We're not all evil, you know, that's your master
would have you believe.

327
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,520
Some of us are good.

328
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:28,822
Some are bad.

329
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:33,074
And the rest are simply unaware.

330
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:37,305
And what kind are you?

331
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:45,363
So where are you headed?

332
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:51,062
The Pendel Mount.

333
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:54,482
Why do you want to be like him?

334
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:59,867
He treats you worse than a dog,
calls witches' abominations.

335
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:04,073
Have you been spying on us?

336
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:07,336
Yes.

337
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:10,126
For whom?

338
00:42:10,432 --> 00:42:12,877
Someone who calls people abominations.

339
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,213
What is that?

340
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:29,969
That... is Tusk.

341
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,703
He's having a bad dream by the sounds of it.

342
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,945
I wonder what monsters have nightmares about.

343
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,128
Humans, probably.

344
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:00,989
Have you been writin' down what you have learned
in your journal, as I have instructed?

345
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,377
- I've a good memory for facts.
- Do you now?

346
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:09,740
You remember the difference
between a Ghost and a Gast?

347
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:13,852
A Ghost is a full spirit, a Gast is a fragment
of a spirit that moved on.

348
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:15,505
Correct.

349
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:21,886
Tusk.

350
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,015
Aim, Tusk, for god's sake.

351
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,598
- What is that?
- The Bell.

352
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:33,048
I'm being summoned.

353
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,983
Tusk, just make yourself scarce.

354
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:55,178
- Are you Gregory?!
- That depend on who's inquiring.

355
00:43:58,126 --> 00:44:00,760
You are cordially invited to the Walled City.

356
00:44:00,878 --> 00:44:05,280
The Inquisitor has instructed me
to return you there, now.

357
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:08,259
That will cost us two days journey.

358
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:13,417
If it's anything less than a Boggart, we are on our way.

359
00:44:13,703 --> 00:44:17,229
- What is a Boggart?
- You do not want to know.

360
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:22,886
The devil is upon us.
There will be slaughter.

361
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,466
The signs of evil are everywhere.

362
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:30,096
And now we have this beast. Unlike anything
we have seen before.

363
00:44:30,303 --> 00:44:32,370
No priest dares go near it.

364
00:44:32,724 --> 00:44:36,375
I thought perhaps you might... better protect us.

365
00:44:36,767 --> 00:44:39,608
Flattery is fine, gold is finer.

366
00:44:50,035 --> 00:44:55,127
- It feels a bit light.
- You'll get the rest when the job is done.

367
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:05,360
Of course!

368
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:09,600
Malkin's most bloodthirsty lieutenant.

369
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:13,120
He has killed more of my kind, than
all the rest altogether.

370
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:15,553
His name is Urag!

371
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,118
It took three regiments to secure the creature.

372
00:45:22,198 --> 00:45:25,160
- That was the only one to survive.
- Leave us.

373
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:27,912
Secure the doors!

374
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,280
I fight him alone.

375
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,010
- Why?
- Ancient code of honor.

376
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:00,652
More important thing, I prefer
not to split the reward.

377
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:28,440
You've chosen the wrong profession, boy.

378
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,116
The cage! Grab him in the cage!

379
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,600
JUMP!

380
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,700
SILVERBANE!

381
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:13,360
We are not finished. Oil!

382
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,600
We must kill him for good.

383
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,800
Throw the cauldron!

384
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,760
Do it.

385
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,480
Unless you prefer to eat his heart?

386
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,088
I can't do this.

387
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:02,831
I'm not like you.

388
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,160
Not yet.

389
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,760
But you will be!

390
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,080
Send them away.

391
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:48,416
I am training you to kill witches!

392
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,760
If you cannot do that, you are useless to me!

393
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:57,764
Yes, that's right. Go soak, boy!

394
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:19,880
HOLD!

395
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:41,315
- My Queen.
- Sarakin.

396
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:47,200
Virahadra, King of swords.

397
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:51,720
Strix, my brave warlock.

398
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:58,040
Good. Now all are here but Urag.

399
00:50:58,548 --> 00:50:59,599
Where is he?

400
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:12,600
Where is your Master?

401
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,680
What's wrong?

402
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:26,360
I can't do what he does.

403
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,000
Good.

404
00:51:30,438 --> 00:51:31,600
Is it?

405
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:35,440
To be no good at something bad is good.

406
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:37,760
It's not that simple.

407
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:54,894
I looked up in an old spell-book
about blue spark.

408
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:58,560
Sometimes it's about destiny.

409
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:02,555
Sometimes it's just.. Dust on witches' fingers.

410
00:52:05,274 --> 00:52:08,384
So it... didn't mean anything?

411
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:16,040
Your Master was in love with a witch once.

412
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:19,160
When he was very young.

413
00:52:20,455 --> 00:52:23,662
- We all have secrets.
- What's yours?

414
00:52:27,362 --> 00:52:28,460
Close your eyes.

415
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,700
Close your eyes.

416
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:14,180
I want to stay here forever.

417
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:19,980
A failed Spook and a Half-witch?

418
00:53:20,621 --> 00:53:22,220
What would we do?

419
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:27,580
Oh, my Mother taught me how to steal.

420
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,671
- I'm rather good at it, when I want to be.
- That you are.

421
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:35,043
Don't laugh.

422
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,209
What would you have us do?

423
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,180
Let me take you away from here.

424
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,220
Somewhere safe, somewhere ...

425
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:53,420
...somewhere where none of this matters.

426
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:56,074
That sounds nice.

427
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:04,660
But there is no place holding that.

428
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:25,200
I have to go back to him.

429
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,892
I don't wanna leave you.

430
00:54:49,347 --> 00:54:51,335
You can't hide from destiny.

431
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:23,400
I too was once young.

432
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:28,231
Did not listen. Was arrogant, like you.

433
00:55:32,315 --> 00:55:34,392
I once loved a witch.

434
00:55:36,452 --> 00:55:39,235
Yes. Malkin.

435
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:48,380
She was not always evil.

436
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,803
Fear and hatred created her.

437
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:56,980
She grew in to what she was perceived to be, deadly.

438
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:02,887
Once she... discovered that I had married ...

439
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,100
she could not endure all my happiness.

440
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,585
She... murdered my wife in cold blood.

441
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:22,620
I captured her.

442
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:29,900
I was clever. I Lied to her.
Told her I still loved her.

443
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:39,100
I... had my chance to kill her, but
I showed her mercy instead.

444
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:46,460
Tricked her. Locked away in a cage
buried under ground.

445
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,580
I thought that prison would hold her to eternity.

446
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:55,100
But I was wrong.

447
00:56:56,614 --> 00:57:01,209
Wrong. Everyone she kills in her wake is my burden.

448
00:57:06,065 --> 00:57:10,121
I want you to meet my wife, Mr. Ward.

449
00:57:10,948 --> 00:57:14,100
This... is Rebecca.

450
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:19,654
This... is why I've been so hard on you, Tom.

451
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:32,460
Do not... make the same mistake.

452
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:37,420
If you see a witch... kill it.

453
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:43,380
My daughter has spotted them. They moving closer.

454
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:48,860
You may do as you wish, with the boy, my darling...

455
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:51,609
I want Gregory.

456
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:53,710
Alive.

457
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:07,115
Beyond the forest - Pendel Mountain. Still three days.

458
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:12,153
Tusk!

459
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:14,832
Dependable as death you are!

460
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,900
- What the hell was that?
- A Boggart.

461
00:58:38,567 --> 00:58:42,180
Subterranean beast, nasty temper. Blind as a bat.

462
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:45,940
- How do you fight a Boggart?
- You don't! You run!

463
00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:11,984
Tusk, run!

464
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:15,048
Follow!

465
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:33,203
- You taught Boggarts are blind?!
- Their sense of smell! Extraordinary!

466
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,900
Jump.

467
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:00,148
We seem to be having a Boggart problem.

468
01:00:02,414 --> 01:00:04,111
Much thanks!

469
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:12,592
Don't worry. We're safe now.

470
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,317
Boggarts. They hate water.

471
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:35,022
Mr Ward!

472
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,265
Mr. Ward!

473
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,265
On the subject of Boggarts,
I'm beginning to find you a tad unreliable.

474
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,750
Tom!

475
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,459
Alice has no place in your thoughts.

476
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:36,573
Your master wants to hunt us, burn us,
eat our hearts.

477
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:40,121
How about I feed you your own?

478
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:50,143
The Stone. It belongs to my Queen.

479
01:02:50,621 --> 01:02:51,938
How did you get it?

480
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:22,537
Don't get up. I'm fine.

481
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:27,514
I'm fine. I was just killing that
enormous... scary... monsters.

482
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:31,318
You do not die easy, do you, Mr. Ward?

483
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,092
And you slay the inslayable.

484
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:11,618
- Where did you get that?
- My mother gave it to me.

485
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,216
What's funny?

486
01:04:20,468 --> 01:04:22,344
You, Mr. Ward.

487
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:30,747
- What's this thing?
- That thing? The Umbranstone.

488
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:36,105
The witches' most sacred talisman.
It strengthens their powers.

489
01:04:36,427 --> 01:04:39,529
Makes their illusions seem more real.

490
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:42,414
Why would my Mom have it?

491
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:50,115
Mother Malkin. She had the stone once.

492
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,810
In her hand it has tremendous power.

493
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,896
But it was stolen from her by another witch.

494
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:05,677
Only then was I able to defeat her. To trap her.

495
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:10,473
Are you telling me that my mother is a witch?

496
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,286
So that is what you are.

497
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:22,651
A witches' son who is a Spook's apprentice.

498
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:26,002
Now that's funny.

499
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:34,597
That must account your visions.

500
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:46,192
Come on.

501
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:49,440
We have a job to do.

502
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:57,843
What happened to Urag?

503
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:01,151
He burned him alive.

504
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,824
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

505
01:06:07,415 --> 01:06:09,412
Spook is a cruel man.

506
01:06:10,372 --> 01:06:13,033
He would do the same to you, if he had the chance.

507
01:06:13,384 --> 01:06:16,715
So with that... apprentice.

508
01:06:17,326 --> 01:06:18,713
Tom is good.

509
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:23,931
- Such a shame he will die.
- I don't want him to die.

510
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:27,373
We could save him.

511
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:30,523
Tom loves you.

512
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:34,291
Your mother saw it in his heart.

513
01:06:34,436 --> 01:06:38,330
Even a Umbranstone cannot hide such thing.

514
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:47,418
Your mother found it. Around Tom's neck.

515
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,887
Get back what was stolen from me.

516
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:54,680
And your boy will be spared.

517
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:57,362
How do I know you are telling the truth?

518
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,910
Get it back.

519
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:16,422
Let us show them what we do
to cities that burn witches.

520
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:19,250
We will avenge our brother's death.

521
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:23,974
Let us give the world a taste of what is to come.

522
01:08:06,657 --> 01:08:09,741
Mum, what's that?

523
01:08:24,745 --> 01:08:27,339
Hell! It's here!

524
01:09:59,813 --> 01:10:01,249
- I'm going back.
- No!

525
01:10:01,419 --> 01:10:02,736
Keep her safe.

526
01:10:07,943 --> 01:10:09,120
Mam!

527
01:10:27,977 --> 01:10:29,888
A witch defend this city.

528
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,372
That witch.

529
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,490
Treacherous thief.

530
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:54,175
You abandoned your people while we
were being destroyed.

531
01:10:55,057 --> 01:10:57,271
And for what?

532
01:10:58,065 --> 01:11:01,848
They will hate you once they know what you are.

533
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,302
You gave away the one thing
that could have saved you.

534
01:11:12,182 --> 01:11:16,804
And that gift will be the death of your son.

535
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:22,839
You are a slave to darkness, Mother Malkin.
Not it's Queen.

536
01:11:51,744 --> 01:11:55,331
- You do the shopping for the pain.
- No.

537
01:11:55,832 --> 01:11:57,719
Make it more human.

538
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,622
We've lost all our possessions, but
somehow you still have that.

539
01:12:03,143 --> 01:12:05,159
That's good luck, I guess.

540
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:17,771
You must never have more than
one sip of this a day.

541
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:21,362
- Why not?
- Because it is mine.

542
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:32,664
Resilient as you are ugly, old friend

543
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,510
What? What is it?

544
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:42,354
Something wrong.

545
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,557
Stay here, we will look ahead.

546
01:13:13,446 --> 01:13:16,022
- Come on.
- I have to stay here, they'll be back soon.

547
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,373
I've changed my mind.

548
01:13:21,219 --> 01:13:22,688
Let's run away.

549
01:13:27,649 --> 01:13:29,009
Do you love me?

550
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:34,885
Yes.

551
01:13:44,578 --> 01:13:48,110
Mr. Ward, go gather wood. We're going to have a fire.

552
01:13:49,254 --> 01:13:50,730
Tom, please.

553
01:13:50,951 --> 01:13:52,542
I said, get the wood.

554
01:13:53,001 --> 01:13:54,535
Stand back, sir.

555
01:13:56,217 --> 01:13:58,452
- Don't make me do this.
- She's a spy.

556
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,760
- She is not the enemy.
- We have a mission, Mr. Ward.

557
01:14:02,966 --> 01:14:05,353
This is your most important test.

558
01:14:07,362 --> 01:14:09,633
- Right now.
- Don't hurt him!

559
01:14:12,175 --> 01:14:13,251
Run.

560
01:14:16,855 --> 01:14:18,884
Damn it, boy! The Stone!

561
01:14:19,073 --> 01:14:20,298
She's stolen it.

562
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:23,909
Now tell me she is innocent.

563
01:15:07,021 --> 01:15:09,538
I not lose this one.

564
01:16:01,299 --> 01:16:04,065
Tom. Grab the staff.

565
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:27,174
Sadly, Gregory, my orders are to deliver you alive.

566
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:03,650
Mom ...

567
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,584
I don't understand.

568
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:16,397
- How can you be here?
- I'm not, Tom.

569
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:20,787
I passed on from this world.

570
01:17:22,753 --> 01:17:24,882
I stood against Mother Malkin.

571
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,800
And I failed.

572
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,852
But you will not fail.

573
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,366
You're a seventh son, Tom.

574
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:38,440
But you are also the son of a witch.

575
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:41,132
There is never been anyone like you.

576
01:17:41,663 --> 01:17:44,073
Only you can wheel the Umbranstone...

577
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:48,489
...and end her reign of darkness before it begins.

578
01:17:52,249 --> 01:17:54,074
Empty your heart of grief.

579
01:17:56,954 --> 01:17:58,474
Fill it with courage.

580
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:02,941
You're ready now.

581
01:18:04,867 --> 01:18:06,095
Go.

582
01:18:08,006 --> 01:18:09,146
Find the Stone.

583
01:18:11,866 --> 01:18:13,130
Fight.

584
01:18:38,107 --> 01:18:39,927
You don't die easy, do you?

585
01:19:22,332 --> 01:19:24,629
We have the Master. Where is the apprentice?

586
01:19:24,709 --> 01:19:28,175
- Dead. Smashed on the rocks.
- What?

587
01:19:29,124 --> 01:19:31,068
I told them to follow you.

588
01:19:34,533 --> 01:19:36,300
You would never do that.

589
01:19:38,162 --> 01:19:39,654
I did it for you.

590
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:42,765
Look at your Queen, and find peace.

591
01:19:54,638 --> 01:19:56,050
Gregory!

592
01:19:56,889 --> 01:19:58,355
Tonight ...

593
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:02,174
...his reign of terror ends.

594
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:06,365
Join us.

595
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,813
You and I will rule this world.

596
01:20:10,151 --> 01:20:13,500
United... for eternity.

597
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:19,242
Look... at me.

598
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:25,327
Look at me!

599
01:20:33,733 --> 01:20:35,622
The darkness is in you now.

600
01:20:42,642 --> 01:20:44,137
Join us.

601
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:49,825
For a worthy enemy...

602
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:55,089
...now honored and welcome.

603
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,868
The war is over.

604
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,210
Now we are together.

605
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,190
Traitor!

606
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:27,541
Don't kill her. Please!

607
01:21:31,644 --> 01:21:33,044
Mother!

608
01:22:30,815 --> 01:22:33,147
Where is my stone?

609
01:22:34,029 --> 01:22:35,301
I lost it.

610
01:22:37,736 --> 01:22:39,305
I took it to protect you.

611
01:23:19,924 --> 01:23:22,893
You fight me as a dragon, not as a man!

612
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,290
Have you no honor?

613
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:14,669
You know nothing of dragons.

614
01:24:18,751 --> 01:24:21,150
Or true honor.

615
01:25:42,518 --> 01:25:45,174
Should have stayed a dragon.

616
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:20,611
What have you done?

617
01:26:21,033 --> 01:26:22,549
She's everything to me.

618
01:26:24,368 --> 01:26:29,558
I thought betrayal was a sin
only committed by humans.

619
01:27:08,206 --> 01:27:09,812
Alone...

620
01:27:10,206 --> 01:27:12,233
I do this alone.

621
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:29,504
I was a fool.

622
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,218
You tricked me.

623
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:35,792
So you could trap me in that hole.

624
01:27:37,617 --> 01:27:40,416
You made me believe that you loved me.

625
01:27:41,368 --> 01:27:43,845
I truly loved you once.

626
01:27:46,312 --> 01:27:47,985
That is still there?

627
01:27:48,664 --> 01:27:50,506
Gone.

628
01:27:52,656 --> 01:27:54,671
As my hatred is.

629
01:28:31,864 --> 01:28:38,068
I... will... haunt... you.

630
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:56,201
In the old days ...

631
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,273
...there was a ceremony.

632
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:01,581
Flags magnificent horns.

633
01:30:02,504 --> 01:30:05,196
Too bad it's sitting just the two of us.

634
01:30:33,157 --> 01:30:34,346
Did it hurt?

635
01:30:44,931 --> 01:30:45,794
No.

636
01:30:51,981 --> 01:30:53,322
So you choose this life?

637
01:30:55,054 --> 01:30:55,997
It chose me.

638
01:30:59,652 --> 01:31:01,122
And the blue spark ...

639
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,325
it was just dust?

640
01:31:33,139 --> 01:31:34,353
Do what you will.

641
01:31:35,427 --> 01:31:36,796
I know how you feel.

642
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:51,462
We will meet again.

643
01:32:13,268 --> 01:32:14,830
Time has come, Mr. Ward.

644
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:20,492
Goodbye, Tusk.

645
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:21,844
Forgive me.

646
01:32:22,073 --> 01:32:25,045
Perhaps I was not clear. It is I who ride.

647
01:32:25,494 --> 01:32:26,941
This is now your home.

648
01:32:28,744 --> 01:32:30,444
I trust you will take care of it.

649
01:32:33,508 --> 01:32:34,778
And Tusk.

650
01:32:36,003 --> 01:32:37,215
Yes, old friend.

651
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:44,125
- Where will you go?
- Wrong question.

652
01:32:44,915 --> 01:32:46,532
Wrong questions give wrong answers.

653
01:32:46,612 --> 01:32:48,311
Tusk, give us a hand.

654
01:32:51,801 --> 01:32:53,538
Remember what I taught you?

655
01:32:55,128 --> 01:32:56,630
Ignore it.

656
01:32:59,897 --> 01:33:01,390
The rules, Tom.

657
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:04,543
Do not be bound by them.

658
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:07,397
Use them in your own way, live your own life.

659
01:33:09,722 --> 01:33:11,457
Your destiny.

660
