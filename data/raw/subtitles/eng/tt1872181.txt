1
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,530
People will say I am a monster...

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,365
...for what I've done.

3
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,034
And maybe they're right.

4
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,539
I always thought that I'd have more...

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,833
- ... time.
- Dad?

6
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,584
Dad!

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,836
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,713
Peter?

9
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,981
He likes to sleep with the light on
at night.

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,732
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,654
Dad.

12
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,117
Be good.

13
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,504
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,717
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,594
Just in case we...

16
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,097
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,766
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,643
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,688
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,483
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,653
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,655
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,741
I know, I know. But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,286
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,011
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,222
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,515
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,560
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,317
Just planning ahead. Do you think
I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,444
Something you need?

31
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,738
Perhaps I can help.

32
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:04,034
I'd just like to radio ahead and make sure
everything's in order for when we land.

33
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,790
I think we both know
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

34
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,766
- Richard.
- They say you're a genius.

35
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,850
Richard!

36
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,520
Not if you thought you could escape.

37
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,354
Richard!

38
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,648
Mary!

39
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,414
Mary!

40
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,551
Mare.

41
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,137
It's okay. It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

42
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,557
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,183
Just gonna make you safe.

44
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,894
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

45
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,772
- Roosevelt.
- What?

46
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,107
Roosevelt.

47
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,535
It's back up. It's back up.

48
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,288
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,749
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

50
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,256
What do you got for me today,
New York?

51
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,300
Reporting live
from New York 1 chopper.

52
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,887
An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium
has been hijacked.

53
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,930
A police chase is in progress.

54
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,557
All right. Let's get to work.

55
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,772
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

56
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,179
Spider-Man!

57
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,972
Hello, pedestrians.

58
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,825
Knock, knock.

59
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,827
Mr. Criminal?

60
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,456
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing...

61
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,708
...just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

62
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,712
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

63
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,382
- I am killer!
- Whoa, okay.

64
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,510
Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material...

65
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,345
...and is highly explosive.

66
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,180
Excuse me.

67
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,474
There's more room on the sidewalk,
folks, please.

68
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,518
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

69
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,811
A little help?

70
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,188
A little help, please.

71
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,025
You having a problem with your gun?

72
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,527
Let me help you out with that.

73
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,195
Coming through.

74
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,532
Too much work...

75
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,243
Oh, this is bad.

76
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,703
I'm gonna be right back.

77
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,250
Heads up. Watch out.

78
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,796
Okay. Okay. There you go.

79
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,799
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

80
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,343
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

81
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,429
"Max"? How do you know my name?

82
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,847
It's written on your badge.

83
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,098
I'm a nobody.

84
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,559
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

85
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,476
Lick that.

86
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,061
All right. Listen to me.

87
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,354
- Now I need you.
- Really?

88
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,064
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

89
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,232
- All right?
- All right.

90
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,609
I'll see you out there.

91
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,863
Warning. Violation of protocol.

92
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,645
Hands up!

93
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,901
Get him, Spidey!

94
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,114
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

95
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,620
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

96
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,372
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

97
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,959
Get the hell out of the way!

98
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,878
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

99
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,423
Oh, come on.

100
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,593
Hey, wait. Come back here.

101
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,137
Heel!

102
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,722
I got you.

103
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,821
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

104
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,864
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

105
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,449
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Where are you?

106
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,410
1 st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.

107
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,245
Five minutes. Ten tops.

108
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,206
- Are those sirens?
- No.

109
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,499
- Peter?
- No.

110
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,251
- Peter?
- No sirens.

111
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,919
No...

112
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,713
Peter.

113
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,506
What is happening?

114
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,882
Peter.

115
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,467
Peter.

116
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,765
Hello?

117
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,228
- Peter? Pe...
- I'll be right there. Promise.

118
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,899
This year's valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

119
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,082
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

120
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,209
...and families of my fellow graduates.

121
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,670
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

122
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,845
Hello.

123
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,513
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

124
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,557
I am running a bit late.

125
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,392
It's over, Spider.

126
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,643
Really?!

127
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,854
I know we all think that we're immortal.

128
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,731
We're supposed to feel that way.

129
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,065
We're graduating.

130
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,986
But, like our brief four years
in high school...

131
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,489
...what makes life valuable...

132
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,866
...is that it doesn't last forever.

133
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,535
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

134
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,580
And I know that now more than ever.

135
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,625
And I say it...

136
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,377
...today of all days...

137
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,255
...to remind us that time is luck.

138
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,554
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

139
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,474
Make yours count for something.

140
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,851
Fight for what matters to you.

141
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,353
No matter what.

142
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,980
Because even if we fall short...

143
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,983
...what better way is there to live?

144
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,581
I'll take that. That's not yours.

145
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,550
This is not end, Spider!

146
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,097
Michael Oates.

147
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,434
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

148
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,064
Alexis Ortiz.

149
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,028
Bo Parisi.

150
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,116
Peter Parker.

151
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,493
Hey, I think I know that guy.

152
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,911
Peter Park...

153
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,708
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,429
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

155
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:55,101
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

156
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,521
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

157
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,523
- I am so proud of you.
- You earned it.

158
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,151
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

159
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,987
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

160
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,238
Yeah, I know too.

161
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,617
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job. "

162
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,954
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail. "

163
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,456
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

164
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,249
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

165
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,460
Ben told me he made it up.

166
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,297
You really did learn something here.

167
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,844
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

168
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,264
Yeah, me too.

169
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,433
And my folks.

170
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,394
Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,191
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

172
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,944
All right, you can go. Go on.

173
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,195
I'll be right back.

174
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,031
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

175
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,909
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

176
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,744
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

177
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,914
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

178
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,749
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,459
- All right.
- All right.

180
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,336
Hey.

181
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,589
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian Mob...

182
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,803
...and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

183
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,055
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

184
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,015
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

185
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,100
Okay.

186
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,268
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

187
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,270
Can't keep me away.

188
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,855
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

189
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,315
- I won't be.
- Okay.

190
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,903
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

191
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,364
All night? I wanna hear it
all night long.

192
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,658
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

193
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,576
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

194
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,788
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

195
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,585
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

196
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,671
Hi.

197
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,259
You're gonna make enemies.

198
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,302
People will get hurt.

199
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,223
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

200
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,352
Leave Gwen out of it.

201
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,106
Promise me that.

202
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,067
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

203
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,249
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

204
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,211
What are you doing? What are you...?

205
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,673
Peter.

206
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,844
What is it?

207
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,389
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

208
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,724
Are you all right?

209
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,350
I don't know what I'm doing.

210
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,521
It's my father, isn't it?

211
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,190
Yeah.

212
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,484
I see him everywhere I go.

213
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,280
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

214
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,325
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen...

215
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,452
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

216
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,623
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

217
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,876
And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner
with your family.

218
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,254
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

219
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,757
I don't know, what does that make you?

220
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,384
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

221
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,266
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

222
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,645
I love you.

223
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,107
Then why isn't that enough?

224
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,944
Because what if
something happens to you...

225
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,696
...just like it happened to him
because of me?

226
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,117
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n...

227
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,035
I cannot let that happen.

228
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,912
Listen to me.

229
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,831
You're Spider-Man...

230
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,625
...and I love that.

231
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,171
But I love Peter Parker more.

232
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,801
That's worth it to me.

233
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,887
I can't lose you too.

234
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,809
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together...

235
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,397
...who does that work out for, Peter?

236
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,818
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

237
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,117
You have done this to me...

238
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,830
...again and again, Peter.

239
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,332
I can't live like this.

240
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,420
I break up with you.

241
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,924
I break up with you.

242
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,424
Good morning, New Yorkers.

243
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,010
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

244
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,553
A few clouds to start us off...

245
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,057
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate...

246
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,684
...over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

247
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,936
How about that Spider-Man?

248
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,563
Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.

249
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,398
We wanna hear your calls.

250
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,985
I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

251
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,364
Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?

252
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,698
It's you and me, taxpayers.

253
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,492
- You make this?
- Yeah.

254
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,619
This is a wind turbine.

255
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,288
You made this? No way.

256
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,957
This is amazing.

257
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,668
It's good as new, right?

258
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,795
I'll walk you home.

259
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,838
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

260
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,299
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

261
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,469
I don't feel like my kids are safe
with him out there.

262
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,555
Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.

263
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,935
Some folks think that there might be
more than one Spider-Man.

264
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,396
What do you think?

265
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,314
One guy or many?

266
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,401
I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.

267
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,652
Hey.

268
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,362
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

269
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,407
We have a caller on the line named
Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.

270
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,827
Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

271
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,413
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

272
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,831
He saved my life one time.

273
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,208
We sort of became best friends.

274
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,461
How much?

275
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,921
Hey, you're that spider guy.

276
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,298
I'm Spider-Man.

277
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,138
I'm Spider-Man.

278
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,266
This Spider-Man... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.

279
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,311
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

280
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,427
Peter, honey?

281
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,637
Can I come in?

282
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
No!

283
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,893
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

284
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,228
You said you would take my car
into the shop...

285
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,938
...because it keeps dying, remember?

286
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,108
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

287
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,152
Peter, please just let me in. All right?

288
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,403
I'm trying to get my...

289
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,823
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

290
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,743
- No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
- What are you do...?

291
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,412
Peter! For goodness sakes.

292
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,624
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee...!

293
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,835
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

294
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,212
I'm just...

295
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,005
I'm very naked right now.

296
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,466
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

297
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,802
- It is?
- Yes.

298
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,846
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

299
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,932
We have no chimney.

300
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,475
What?

301
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,185
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

302
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,062
Downstairs, now.

303
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,065
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
- All right, I'm leaving.

304
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,693
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

305
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,028
Well, look who's here.

306
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Spidey.

307
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,282
How was your morning?

308
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,617
Aces, Max, aces.

309
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,870
I've been out saving the world.

310
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,455
Protecting everybody.

311
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,458
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

312
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,003
That's why you're here.

313
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,172
You remembered my birthday.

314
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,093
All the crime-fighting you've been doing,
and all of a sudden...

315
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,847
...you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

316
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,892
But of course you would.

317
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,643
Why wouldn't you visit me?

318
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,729
We're best friends.

319
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,068
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

320
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,489
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

321
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,532
I know what they say about you
in the press...

322
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,910
...but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

323
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,786
Because you're amazing.

324
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,040
That's what the press needs.

325
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,126
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

326
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,212
You like that, Spidey?

327
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,380
I like it a lot, Max.

328
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,300
Good. Because today...

329
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,093
...is going to be...

330
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,345
...amazing.

331
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,098
Yeah. Circuit 39.

332
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,980
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

333
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,192
I just wanna know if you can find
another waitress...

334
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,112
...to replace me because I start
my training rounds at the hospital.

335
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,907
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

336
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,450
Because he'll worry.

337
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,078
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

338
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,871
Double shift on Thursday.

339
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,623
Okay, bye.

340
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,127
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

341
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,423
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

342
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,926
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

343
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,555
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar.

344
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,977
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

345
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,313
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

346
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,023
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

347
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,609
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

348
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,280
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

349
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,532
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

350
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,286
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

351
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,162
I understand that. I'm in college now.

352
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,124
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

353
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,876
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red...

354
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,128
- ... so no.
- That was a mistake.

355
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,381
Because I was washing
the American flag.

356
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,676
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.

357
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,927
I do, and I won't anymore.

358
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,179
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.

359
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,849
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

360
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,392
Back off, eat your breakfast.

361
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,272
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

362
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,857
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

363
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,942
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

364
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,528
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

365
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,863
Jerk.

366
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,991
Not gonna make it.

367
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,663
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

368
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,791
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

369
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,922
Oscorp Industries...

370
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,594
...is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

371
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:23,182
By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers...

372
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,935
...we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy...

373
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,647
...to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs...

374
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,191
...and eventually the world
for generations to come.

375
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,444
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

376
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,529
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible...

377
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,323
...for the entire city's energy supply?

378
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,533
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

379
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,911
...and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

380
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,664
...and those power grids
were designed by me.

381
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,082
You designed them?

382
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,459
Sure you did.

383
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,211
And I'm Spider-Man.

384
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,506
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

385
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,884
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna rip
your well-groomed head off!

386
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,095
Now, get to work.

387
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,556
What floor, please?

388
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,101
- Seventy-four.
- Thank you.

389
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,644
Oh, hold that!

390
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,105
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

391
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,315
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

392
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,359
Most people would have
just let those close.

393
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,236
Most people don't notice other people.

394
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,863
- What floor, please?
- Sixty-three...

395
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,699
I got it. I got it. What is it?

396
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,991
Sixty-three.

397
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,119
Sixty-three, please.

398
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,412
- Thank you.
- In a hurry.

399
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,872
Thank you very much.

400
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,920
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

401
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,505
I'm Gwen.

402
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,549
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

403
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,009
Is it your birthday?

404
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,223
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They...
Friends of mine made this flyer up.

405
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:50,018
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club. A lot of celebrities.

406
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,313
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

407
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,775
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

408
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,652
- ... dressed as Spider-Man...
- That's exciting.

409
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,195
...hanging out near the blaze.

410
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,866
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

411
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,327
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

412
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,414
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved...

413
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,665
...me.

414
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,542
He said he needed me.

415
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,795
That must be a good feeling.

416
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,339
Sixty-third floor.

417
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,842
It was nice to meet you, Max.

418
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,555
Wait. She remembered my name.

419
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,240
Welcome home.

420
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,670
It's dark in there.

421
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,006
Your eyes will adjust.

422
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,176
It's better this way.

423
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,540
Dad.

424
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,216
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

425
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,302
Looking at my son...

426
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,638
...and seeing a stranger.

427
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,560
You have such potential, Harry.

428
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,480
Such fierce intelligence...

429
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,566
...and you're throwing it all away.

430
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,818
No, you threw me away.

431
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,240
You kicked me off to boarding school
when I was 11.

432
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,035
On my 16th birthday...

433
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,996
...you sent me Scotch.

434
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,331
Or one of your assistants did.

435
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,418
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

436
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,047
"With compliments, Norman Osborn. "

437
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,009
I don't expect forgiveness from you...

438
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,760
...anymore.

439
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,598
I don't believe in miracles.

440
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,559
How could you possibly understand...

441
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,605
...that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

442
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,607
...for something greater?

443
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,276
And not just for me.

444
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,944
For you!

445
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,158
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

446
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,705
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming...

447
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,750
...hiding under your skin...

448
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,086
...waiting to show itself.

449
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,672
To show you...

450
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,717
...who you really are.

451
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,515
Retroviral hyperplasia.

452
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,811
I never told you...

453
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,065
...that it's genetic.

454
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,735
Our disease...

455
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,072
...the Osborn curse.

456
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,450
And it began at your age.

457
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,244
Let me see it.

458
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,332
Your hand. Give it to me.

459
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,802
The greatest inheritance
I can give you...

460
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,929
...isn't merely money.

461
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
It's this.

462
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,351
The sum total of all my work.

463
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,563
Everything I did to stay alive.

464
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,274
Maybe you can succeed...

465
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,527
...where I failed.

466
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:36,722
Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died...

467
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,640
...the Osborn estate has confirmed.

468
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,184
He is survived by his only son,
Harry Osborn...

469
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,271
...who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.

470
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,731
Harry.

471
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,192
Osborn changed the medical profession's
approach to human healing...

472
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,820
...and affected the lives of millions.

473
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,533
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:

474
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,244
"We can do better.
And we should do better. "

475
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,875
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking. "

476
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,627
But change isn't just a slogan.

477
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,755
It begins with hard work.

478
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,425
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

479
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,179
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

480
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,683
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

481
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,602
But not today.

482
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,729
Today is for mourning.

483
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,106
- Hello?
- Is this Gwen Stacy?

484
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,483
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

485
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,570
I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.

486
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,911
- Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

487
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,872
There's a current flow problem in the lab.
Why don't you take a look?

488
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,750
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

489
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,294
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

490
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,921
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

491
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,714
Happy birthday.

492
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,845
Bioelectrogenesis:

493
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,891
The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off...

494
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,185
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

495
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,436
The genetically manipulated...

496
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,522
At least somebody's partying.

497
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,358
All right. Just a little sick.

498
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,945
I got your medicine, though.

499
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,616
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

500
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,951
Designed the grid...

501
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,703
- Warning:
- I should've stretched.

502
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,623
- Malfunction in Sector 5A.
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

503
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,376
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, did you, Kari?

504
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,586
Think you can sing "Happy Birthday"
for me?

505
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,797
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

506
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,298
- Gilbert?
- What?

507
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,052
It's Max. Can we shut down power
on Sector 32, please?

508
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,428
Forget it. I'm out the door.

509
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,472
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

510
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,057
- Sorry, Max.
- Hello?

511
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,896
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

512
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,857
This is crazy.

513
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,000
System restored.

514
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,627
Have a nice day.

515
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,587
Harry...

516
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,672
...Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny...

517
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,091
...in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

518
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,426
...breach of trust.

519
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,011
You mean people are pissed off...

520
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,181
...because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

521
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,684
Given that...

522
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,355
...all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed...

523
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,857
...to restore investor confidence.

524
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,694
That is the Osborn way.

525
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,531
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

526
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,285
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

527
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,664
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

528
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,666
Sure, sure. I get it.

529
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,168
Twenty-year-old kid.

530
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,087
Two hundred billion dollar company.

531
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,922
What was Dad thinking?

532
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,675
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

533
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,347
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

534
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,809
Someone must've thought about
having him declared legally incompetent.

535
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,186
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

536
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,730
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.

537
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,109
We're not friends.

538
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,824
Hi.

539
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,580
You were his assistant, right?

540
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,544
What's your name?

541
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,462
Felicia.

542
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,880
Felicia.

543
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,716
From now on...

544
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,761
...everybody at this table
works for Felicia...

545
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,557
...because Felicia works for me.

546
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,893
Would anybody like to speak up?

547
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,524
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

548
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,154
Sir, there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

549
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,582
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

550
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,835
Every single one.

551
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,886
Peter Parker.

552
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,264
It's like seeing a ghost.

553
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,767
Hey, Harry.

554
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,810
Random.

555
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,646
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

556
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,232
But you're close.

557
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,568
What's up?

558
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,904
I saw the news, man.

559
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,366
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

560
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,620
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

561
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,373
I'm with some people.

562
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,127
I'm in a...

563
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,921
I'm in a meeting.

564
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,756
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

565
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,508
I know it's been a long time.

566
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,803
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

567
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,639
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

568
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,975
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

569
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,811
Thank you.

570
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,898
It's good to see you, man.

571
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,610
It's good to see you.

572
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,405
I'm sorry about your dad.

573
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,535
You got your braces off.

574
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,917
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

575
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,797
There he is.

576
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,799
There he is.

577
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,844
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

578
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,765
You know, one of my manservants
holds the hair dryer...

579
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,809
...but I work the comb, okay?

580
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,063
So at least I'm not completely helpless.

581
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,315
You're stupid.

582
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,199
After graduation, I went to Brazil,
then Singapore.

583
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,451
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

584
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,494
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

585
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,871
I saw you.

586
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,956
What do you mean, you saw me?

587
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,417
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

588
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,419
You know what I'm talking about?

589
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,340
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

591
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,925
I know.

592
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,345
What?

593
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,556
You got a lady?

594
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,896
That's a question.

595
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,440
That's a question.

596
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,941
Whoa, buddy.

597
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,527
No, I don't.

598
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,696
Yeah.

599
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,157
I don't know. It's...

600
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,537
I don't know. It's complicated.

601
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,623
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

602
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,586
What's her name? Who is she?

603
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,962
Her name's Gwen.

604
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,881
Gwen Stacy.

605
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,384
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

606
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,094
Really? She works for me?

607
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,640
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

608
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,852
You know, when my father
sent me away...

609
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,980
...I tried to forget
everything about this place.

610
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,401
I guess that kind of included you.

611
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,032
You ain't gotta explain anything
to me, man.

612
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,327
We both got dumped.

613
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,333
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

614
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,089
My dad left a briefcase.

615
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,092
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

616
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,636
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

617
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,680
How's that working out for you?

618
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,723
Perfectly.

619
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,107
Dude. Nice arm.

620
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,985
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

621
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,404
You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.

622
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,947
Yeah, right.

623
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,701
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

624
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,036
Giant lizards...

625
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,539
...and spider guys.

626
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,460
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

627
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,006
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

628
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,343
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

629
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,679
I'm so impressed.

630
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,015
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

631
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,891
For what?

632
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,853
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

633
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,522
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually. "

634
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,819
Who was he?

635
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,822
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

636
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,825
No associates or friends to speak of.

637
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,412
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

638
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,788
The guy was...

639
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,749
...invisible.

640
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,587
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

641
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,839
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

642
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:59,719
In the meantime, if the press gets hold
of this accident, our stock will crater.

643
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,806
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

644
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,436
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

645
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,671
Hey.

646
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,283
Hey, moron! Get out of the street!

647
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,882
Hey. Hi.

648
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,926
Hi.

649
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,471
You look amazing.

650
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,143
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of...

651
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,854
No. I don't... I... Spontaneous...

652
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,231
...is all right. You know.

653
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,942
Well, I just figured it was time.

654
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,278
You know?

655
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,447
Time that we try to be friends.

656
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:26,949
Yeah.

657
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,204
Friends, yeah. That's...

658
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,331
...great.

659
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,833
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

660
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,252
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

661
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,087
Keep it simple.

662
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,050
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

663
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,551
Well, I mean...

664
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,683
If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

665
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,186
- Some ground rules?
- Yeah, some ground rules.

666
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,813
Like that.

667
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,272
Like what?

668
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,776
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

669
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,569
That's off the table.

670
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,530
- My laugh is off the table?
- Off the table.

671
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,074
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

672
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,245
That's still adorable.

673
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,997
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

674
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,457
No, it's not adorable.

675
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,377
- Okay. I have a ground rule.
- Oh, good.

676
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,878
What is it?

677
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,756
Don't tell me that I look amazing...

678
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,052
...with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

679
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,097
I'm really serious about that one.

680
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,308
- Oh, no.
- What?

681
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,352
I just figured out the next ground rule.

682
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,770
What?

683
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,522
No more of this.

684
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,732
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

685
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,568
- This?
- Don't think I haven't... Hey.

686
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,529
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

687
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,197
This is killing me.

688
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,950
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

689
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,451
Come on.

690
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,455
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

691
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,537
Yeah. So I did that.

692
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:41,667
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

693
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,587
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

694
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,256
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

695
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,677
How do you know that?

696
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,557
How do you know I love it there?

697
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,517
Because...

698
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,396
Because you told me.

699
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,693
It just opened last month.

700
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,282
Have you been following me?

701
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,122
I knew it.

702
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,999
How often?

703
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,088
Just once a day.

704
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,673
Sometimes.

705
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,760
Sometimes more.

706
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,891
Oh, boy.

707
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,393
Why?

708
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,482
Make sure I'm safe?

709
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,193
- And...
- And what?

710
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,863
And because it's the closest I can get
to still being with you.

711
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,211
I'm moving to England.

712
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,846
What?

713
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,806
Yeah.

714
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,852
I have a...
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

715
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,106
In molecular medicine.
And it's between me and this other kid.

716
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,233
There's this oral exam
that we have to do...

717
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,236
...and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

718
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,363
And... And it's... It could be him.

719
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,407
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

720
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,952
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

721
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,164
Yeah.

722
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,166
And I'm really excited.

723
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,918
That's...

724
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,506
England.

725
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,677
What?

726
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,111
Station, I need a 10-85.

727
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,364
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

728
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,491
Folks, could you step to the side?

729
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,868
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

730
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,747
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

731
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,917
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

732
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,128
Let me see your hands, please!

733
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,172
You stay right where you are!

734
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,632
Do not move!

735
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,009
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

736
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,529
Get down on the ground, now!

737
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,407
- Stop!
- Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

738
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,325
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

739
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,952
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you...

740
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,912
- Please!
- ... to get down on the ground, now!

741
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,374
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

742
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,253
Oh, my gosh.

743
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,299
They see me. You see me.

744
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,802
You see me.

745
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,888
They see me.

746
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,943
- No! No! Stop!
- On the ground now!

747
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,821
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

748
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,365
Wait! It's not my fault.

749
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,617
It's not my fault!

750
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,996
I said stop!

751
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,588
I'm glad you're not one of those cops
that rides a horse.

752
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,348
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

753
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,313
All units, hold your fire! I repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!

754
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,359
Stop. Stop it.

755
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,735
Yo, Sparkles!

756
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,655
Hey, how you doing?

757
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,158
- It's you?
- Yeah, I know it's me.

758
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,284
Who are you?

759
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,329
You don't remember me?

760
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,706
No. Should I?

761
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,752
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

762
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,420
You saved me.

763
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,339
You said you needed me.

764
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,259
- You're the guy with the blueprints.
- Yes.

765
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,718
Blueprints.

766
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:29,848
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

767
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,893
- What's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

768
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,562
- I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

769
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,606
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

770
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,775
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
with the...

771
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,694
You look different.

772
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,404
How are you?

773
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,489
I don't know what's going on with me.

774
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,783
I can see that. I can... I believe you.

775
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,330
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much...

776
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,499
I got so much anger.

777
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,502
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

778
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,504
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

779
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,506
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

780
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,342
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

781
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,511
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They won't.

782
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,264
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

783
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,851
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

784
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,353
You and me, okay?
It's just you and me talking.

785
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,982
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

786
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,233
I just...

787
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,862
I just wanted everyone to see me.

788
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,031
He makes a move, you take that shot.

789
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,199
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

790
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,243
Away from all these people, okay?

791
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,453
Yeah, yes.

792
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,247
No! No! Stop!

793
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,127
Max!

794
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,357
Spidey, Spidey, Spidey!

795
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,069
You stupid freak!

796
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,951
Electro dummy!

797
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,169
Get out of here, you freak!

798
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
Shut up!

799
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,716
You're so selfish.

800
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,094
Stay with me, Max.

801
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,637
You set me up.

802
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,097
No, I didn't set you up.

803
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,848
You lied to me!

804
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,850
No, I'm trying to help you.
Let me help you.

805
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:25,983
Are you all right?

806
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,407
It's my birthday.

807
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,617
Now it's time for me
to light my candles.

808
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,739
Do we have visual on Spider-Man?

809
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,284
Does anyone have visual
on Spider-Man?

810
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,923
Okay. All right, that's enough. All right.

811
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,550
- Mike.
- Yeah.

812
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,051
- Big John.
- Nice job.

813
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,719
Nice work, fellas.

814
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,764
It's a pleasure doing business
with you.

815
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,274
Spider-Man.

816
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,948
England?

817
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,701
Really?

818
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,962
Good talk.

819
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,815
Our coverage of this breaking story...

820
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,318
...begins with New York 1 's
Jessica Abo at the scene.

821
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,987
That's right. We're standing here
with two eyewitnesses...

822
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,072
...who are going to tell us
what they just saw.

823
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,074
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

824
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,868
How do you think
he beat this creature?

825
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,911
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized,
Spidey's suit.

826
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,705
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.

827
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,249
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.

828
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,001
Thank you very much
to the two of you.

829
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,712
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.

830
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,423
We will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.

831
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,009
For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.

832
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,703
Online polls show a sudden uptick...

833
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,330
...in public sentiment
in favor of the web-crawler.

834
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,418
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

835
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,035
Next-generation military body armor.

836
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,289
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair...

837
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,833
...direct nervous system interface.

838
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,053
So the common household spider...

839
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,638
...unlike human cells...

840
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,474
...theirs contain the power
to self-heal...

841
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,269
...from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.

842
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:41,107
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

843
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:46,238
Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.

844
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,324
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

845
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,619
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

846
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,372
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

847
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,792
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

848
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:02,796
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...

849
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,382
...the battery might explode!

850
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,217
Explode!

851
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,889
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

852
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,266
You're not invincible.

853
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,434
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

854
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,311
- Hello.
- Pete.

855
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,187
It's me.

856
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,148
Hey, Harry. What...?

857
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,942
What time is it?

858
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,988
Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

859
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,698
I need to see you.

860
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,158
You all right?

861
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,784
Not really, Pete.

862
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,494
I'm dying.

863
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,497
But I think you can help
save my life.

864
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,086
You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.

865
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,214
The hope is to extract the venom
from their glands...

866
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,884
...and turn that into a cure.

867
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,720
An agent that heals diseased cells.

868
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:39,100
And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases...

869
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,436
...like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

870
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:48,026
They never made it to human trials.

871
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,988
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

872
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,451
Except maybe this.

873
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,086
Spider-Man.

874
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,338
What about him?

875
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,008
He was bitten by one of those things,
and it worked.

876
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,262
I don't know how
and I don't know why...

877
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,141
...but he can do everything else
a spider can...

878
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,519
...including self-heal.

879
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,479
I need to find him.

880
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,856
I need his blood.

881
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,748
You need...

882
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,002
...Spider-Man's blood?

883
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,632
It'll save my life.

884
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,968
It may not, Har.

885
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,554
It may not be that simple.

886
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,556
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

887
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,807
Connors was weak.

888
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,309
This is me, Peter.

889
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,645
I don't think you can just set up a van...

890
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,814
...and have him donate.

891
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:13,278
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about
people shoving needles and...

892
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,654
He's sensitive, okay.

893
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:19,909
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is...

894
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,454
...and I will go ask him myself.

895
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:23,955
What?

896
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,960
- You took his picture.
- So?

897
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,212
- You know him.
- Harry.

898
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,758
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

899
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,217
I don't know him.

900
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,014
I put together what you said
at the river.

901
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,310
- What I...
- About how he gives people hope.

902
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,730
Come on.

903
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,536
What in the...?

904
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,043
Just say yes.

905
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,885
Don't turn your back on me!

906
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,680
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

907
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,809
Please.

908
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,020
Peter, please.

909
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,647
I can't.

910
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,693
Please.

911
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,200
I'm gonna try...

912
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,702
...and find Spider-Man.

913
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,757
- Hey, what's security doing over here?
- That's so weird.

914
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:58,883
She's right over there.

915
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,767
Hey! Miss Stacy!

916
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,034
Hi.

917
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,536
Hi.

918
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,163
What are you doing here?

919
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,248
What are you doing here?

920
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,293
Come here.

921
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,051
She's not here. Check another floor.

922
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,678
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

923
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,013
You're in trouble.

924
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,431
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

925
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,434
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

926
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,937
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

927
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,357
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

928
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,569
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way.
He was, like, a fanatic.

929
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,448
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of
a "want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

930
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,742
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

931
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,038
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

932
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,539
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

933
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:12,999
That's Oscorp.

934
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,126
And what about you? Why are you here?

935
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,419
Harry.

936
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,129
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

937
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,923
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

938
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,592
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life...

939
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,511
...is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

940
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,223
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

941
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,266
Or something worse.

942
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,060
I know.

943
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,771
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

944
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,191
This is the most clichéd hiding place
you could've chosen.

945
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,401
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry...

946
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:44,614
...I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

947
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:48,618
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

948
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,422
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

949
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,466
How'd you like it?

950
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,301
It felt a little bit rushed.

951
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,679
I know. I know, I know.

952
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,683
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

953
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,850
Okay.

954
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,492
- God! Damn it!
- I'm so...

955
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,954
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

956
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,039
And you too? I'm sorry.

957
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,791
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

958
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,294
- Just stay right...
- Wait, wait, wait.

959
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,545
Hey! Stop!

960
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,007
All right. On your way.

961
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,509
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

962
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,474
- Gwen Stacy.
- Oh, my God.

963
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,727
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

964
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,312
No, it's okay.

965
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,481
I'm... I'm Harry.

966
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,191
Yeah.

967
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:06,571
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

968
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,448
I was kind of rushing.

969
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,117
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

970
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,453
I thought you two had broken up.

971
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,666
Yeah. Yes, we had.

972
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,460
And it's...

973
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,587
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

974
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,049
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

975
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,300
Yeah.

976
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,093
Yeah.

977
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,262
Yeah, you're right.

978
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,598
But that's why he needs you.

979
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:36,434
Right?

980
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,105
To help him make his choices clear.

981
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:45,943
Nice to meet you, Harry.

982
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,197
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

983
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:48,131
You've been in a terrible accident.

984
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,384
I'm Dr. Kafka.

985
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:53,970
I'm here to help you.

986
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,930
Course you are, doc.

987
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:01,060
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

988
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,646
High-intensity capacitors.

989
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,107
The kind they make at Oscorp.

990
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,277
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

991
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,695
You are correct.

992
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,030
I'm here to study you.

993
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,952
To understand what you are,
why you are.

994
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,079
Und I will get results.

995
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,295
I always do.

996
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,466
You do realize...

997
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,885
...you locked me in a prison...

998
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,720
...that runs...

999
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,805
...on electricity?

1000
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,935
I can feel it in the walls.

1001
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,104
I can feel it in my veins.

1002
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,649
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

1003
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,235
It's a force of nature.

1004
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,905
Like me.

1005
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:02,872
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1006
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,374
Well, so do I.

1007
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,174
I'm dying to know...

1008
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,009
...doc.

1009
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,763
But you better make damn sure
you kill me this time.

1010
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,515
Because if you don't...

1011
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,184
...I'm gonna kill the light.

1012
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,897
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1013
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,608
A world without power.

1014
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,236
A world without mercy.

1015
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,029
A world...

1016
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,906
...without Spider-Man.

1017
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:41,702
And everyone will be able to see me
for who I truly am.

1018
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,372
And who are you?

1019
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,374
Don't you know?

1020
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,251
I'm Electro.

1021
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,801
Warning: Electrical restraint
capacity reached.

1022
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,804
Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1023
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,681
Very impressive...

1024
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,308
...Electro.

1025
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,936
Lockdown initiated.

1026
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,158
Aunt May?

1027
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:27,915
What are you doing?

1028
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,792
When did you do this?

1029
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,929
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1030
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,182
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1031
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,728
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1032
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,813
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1033
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:52,440
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1034
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,234
You have to tell me, May.

1035
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,445
That's my father.

1036
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,113
Yes, he was your father.

1037
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,991
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1038
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,868
...here.

1039
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,996
I need the truth.

1040
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,792
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1041
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,794
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1042
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,756
...was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1043
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:21,761
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1044
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,598
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1045
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,099
Your father?

1046
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,517
No.

1047
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,897
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth...

1048
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,816
...and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1049
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:40,780
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

1050
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,657
...who has to take nursing classes...

1051
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,785
...with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1052
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,120
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1053
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,497
I don't know how. And...

1054
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,459
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1055
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,379
...who was never here. No.

1056
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,090
No, I won't tell you.

1057
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,466
You're my boy.

1058
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,052
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1059
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:04,387
And I won't hurt you.

1060
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,731
I'm your boy.

1061
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,733
You're my everything.

1062
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,446
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1063
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,116
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1064
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,994
- I love you so much.
- I know.

1065
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,209
It's okay.

1066
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,670
It's okay.

1067
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,799
May.

1068
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:47,096
I need to know.

1069
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,935
All right.

1070
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,399
I'll tell you everything I know.

1071
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,862
But it will hurt you.

1072
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,072
Okay.

1073
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:10,202
A few days after the funeral...

1074
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,206
...two government men came to see us.

1075
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,170
They said the genetics research...

1076
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,882
...that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable...

1077
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,760
...and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1078
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,012
And that's why he ran off with it.

1079
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,972
They said he was a traitor.

1080
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,974
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1081
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,144
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1082
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,854
...for the money.

1083
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,231
I don't...

1084
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,069
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1085
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,948
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1086
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,450
It doesn't make any sense.

1087
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:50,910
Peter, I don't know.

1088
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,371
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1089
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,874
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1090
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,627
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1091
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,963
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1092
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,883
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1093
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,302
Came home at 6 every night.

1094
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:10,888
I don't know.

1095
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:14,683
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1096
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,229
Even from the people they love.

1097
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,611
Peter.

1098
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,157
Peter.

1099
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,704
Mr. Osborn.

1100
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,877
Look up.

1101
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,630
Think you're looking for me.

1102
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,552
I cannot believe my eyes.

1103
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,596
Spider-Man.

1104
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,897
Just the man I wanted to see.

1105
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,026
You...

1106
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,946
...talked to Peter?

1107
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,906
Yeah.

1108
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,207
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1109
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,920
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1110
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,297
Excuse me?

1111
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,008
It's too dangerous.

1112
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:32,261
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1113
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,514
I'm already dying.

1114
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,268
Your blood can't make me die more.

1115
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,270
But it could do something worse.

1116
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,190
Okay.

1117
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,569
All right, how much?

1118
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,113
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.

1119
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:55,326
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1120
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,829
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1121
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:00,664
I don't.

1122
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,376
I thought you...

1123
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,546
I thought you were supposed to
save people.

1124
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,259
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1125
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,803
You're... You're just gonna let me die.

1126
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,265
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1127
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,935
You're trying to protect yourself.

1128
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,731
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1129
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:27,650
- ... to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1130
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,575
I'm sorry.

1131
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,920
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1132
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:04,436
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

1133
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,606
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

1134
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,442
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1135
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,988
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1136
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,198
Everything's a mess.
Everything's insane.

1137
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:19,034
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1138
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:21,829
Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1139
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,914
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do
with Harry.

1140
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,624
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1141
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,501
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1142
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:30,587
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1143
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,339
I don't know. I got no idea.

1144
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,844
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1145
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,847
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1146
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,641
Ms. Stacy?

1147
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,435
Shall I take you upstairs?

1148
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,062
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1149
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:51,483
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1150
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,527
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1151
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,947
- I'm... Okay. I have to be...
- Where are we?

1152
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,574
I'm at my...

1153
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:01,994
...last interview for Oxford
right now.

1154
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,873
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

1155
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:08,417
Okay, well...

1156
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:10,544
I'm sorry to bother you...

1157
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,379
...my fair lady... Madam.

1158
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,381
But who am I?

1159
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,175
I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins.

1160
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,469
I'm one of the young professors
at Harvard...

1161
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,680
...and I've been trying to get her
to be in my...

1162
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,641
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1163
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,811
And she's just the best person I know
and a scientific genius.

1164
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,063
And...

1165
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,731
Anyway, God save the queen.

1166
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:32,775
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1167
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,526
Peter. Peter.

1168
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,361
What do you want to say to me?

1169
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,655
What's the "one thing"?

1170
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,578
I have to go to England, Peter.

1171
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:47,956
It's important to me.

1172
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,964
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1173
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,717
You know? I don't know.

1174
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:00,302
Maybe we're just...

1175
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,346
...going different ways. I don't...

1176
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,681
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1177
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:08,811
Gwen.

1178
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,107
Good luck.

1179
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,946
Hi. Sorry.

1180
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,467
He took the D train every morning
at 7 to work.

1181
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,512
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1182
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,022
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1183
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,649
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension...

1184
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,611
...of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square...

1185
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,489
...built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye...

1186
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,160
...to keep his polio hidden
from the American people. "

1187
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,630
Mr. Osborn?

1188
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,507
You all right?

1189
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,260
Is there anything I can get you?

1190
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:08,513
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1191
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,224
Spiders?

1192
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,434
The ones that they destroyed...

1193
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,772
..."to restore investor confidence. "

1194
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,983
Go home, Felicia.

1195
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,526
Take the day off.

1196
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:24,905
Harry.

1197
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,827
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1198
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:37,459
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1199
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:40,337
Before they destroyed the spiders...

1200
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:42,923
...they had the venom extracted.

1201
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,718
What?

1202
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:50,430
What are you saying?

1203
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,516
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1204
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,602
...but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1205
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,980
Where is it?

1206
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,148
It's somewhere in the building.

1207
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,195
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects. "

1208
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,032
Special Projects.

01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:42,691
...so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.

1219
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:44,901
A world without power.

1220
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,361
A world...

1221
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:48,280
...without Spider-Man.

1222
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:49,948
Warning:

1224
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:55,287
He's busy. You can't go in there.
He's busy.

1225
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,539
What did you do?

1226
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,208
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1227
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,504
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1228
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:09,134
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1229
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:13,180
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1230
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,349
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1231
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,768
Progress has its stepping stones.

1232
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,812
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1233
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,647
How do I put this gently?

1234
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,899
...fired.

1235
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,277
You are not going to bury me too.

1236
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:30,197
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1237
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,616
It's only a matter of time.

1238
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,535
You're going to die a horrible death.

1239
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,537
Like your father.

1240
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,748
The difference is...

1241
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,084
...no one is going to miss you.

1242
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,129
Get him out.

1243
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,381
Wait. Wait.

1244
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,390
I know my way out.

1245
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,652
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1246
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,071
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1247
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:12,656
I tried. Good luck.

1248
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,700
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

1249
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,137
Test.

1250
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:43,473
My name is Richard Parker.

1251
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:45,809
Whatever lies will be told about me...

1252
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,936
...I would like the world
to know the truth.

1253
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:52,148
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...

1254
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,237
...when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization...

1255
01:32:57,488 --> 01:32:59,990
...to continue funding my research.

1256
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,617
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1257
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,412
Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.

1258
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:06,997
So I refused.

1259
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,375
And now, to eliminate me
from the picture...

1260
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:14,504
...Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me...

1261
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,258
...in order to take control
of my work.

1262
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,013
Can I help you?

1263
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,557
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1264
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:27,100
I'm Harry Osborn.

1265
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:31,354
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1266
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,482
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1267
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,319
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1268
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,450
But it doesn't matter
because there's something else...

1269
01:33:44,493 --> 01:33:46,286
...that Norman doesn't know.

1270
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,497
The human DNA...

1271
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:52,626
...that I implanted in the spiders...

1272
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:55,629
...was my own.

1273
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,425
Which means that without me...

1274
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,344
...without my bloodline...

1275
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:07,223
...Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1276
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,018
Keep Electro incubated...

1277
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:14,439
...with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1278
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:20,403
I have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives.

1279
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,614
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1280
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:26,076
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1281
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:30,121
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.

1282
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,165
But as a father...

1283
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,669
...it means I may not
see my boy again.

1284
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,006
And nothing is as important to me...

1285
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,759
...as my son, Peter.

1286
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:44,886
Nothing in this world.

1287
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,472
But I have a responsibility...

1288
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,766
...to protect the world
from what I've created...

1289
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:52,977
...and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.

1290
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:56,231
People will say I am a monster...

1291
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,817
...for what I've done.

1292
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,028
And maybe they're right.

1293
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,908
I always thought that I'd have more...

1294
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,243
...time.

1295
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,370
Dad? Dad!

1296
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:11,913
I'm sorry.

1297
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,434
Sedation off.

1298
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:41,359
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1299
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:43,778
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1300
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,697
Who are you?

1301
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:49,075
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1302
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,120
I should kill you.

1303
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,080
Oh, come on.

1304
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,499
Think bigger, Max.

1305
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,752
I'm not the one you want.

1306
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,295
You want Spider-Man.

1307
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:03,631
And I can give him to you.

1308
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:08,553
But I need something first.

1309
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,140
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1310
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,017
Get you in?

1311
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,935
You own it.

1312
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,188
Not anymore.

1313
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,689
Oscorp betrayed us both...

1314
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,777
...so I can't get in there without you
and you can't get out of here without me.

1315
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,322
- What's happening?
- Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.

1316
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,116
Get a containment team up there now.

1317
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,494
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1318
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,454
You submitted the design for the grid...

1319
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,581
...and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1320
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,625
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1321
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,586
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max...

1322
01:36:41,837 --> 01:36:43,755
...and it's right at your fingertips.

1323
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:45,799
And then once you shut down
the grid...

1324
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,969
...Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1325
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,972
Break it! Break it!

1326
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,644
Max, we don't have much time!

1327
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,230
Go! Go, go! Go!

1328
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,524
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1329
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:03,817
Because I need you!

1330
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:06,736
You need me?

1331
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,906
Yes. I need you.

1332
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:14,285
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1333
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:15,453
You need me?

1334
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:17,622
Yes. I need you.

1335
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:19,874
I need you. Please! Please!

1336
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:22,794
Please!

1337
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,004
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1338
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:26,256
Please, Max!

1339
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,424
I need you! I need you!

1340
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,851
No!

1341
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,523
You wanna be my friend?

1342
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,359
I thought we were already friends.

1343
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,404
I had a friend once.

1344
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,240
It didn't work out.

1345
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,451
Yeah. Me too.

1346
01:38:37,953 --> 01:38:40,038
Then let's go catch a spider.

1347
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,960
You have one new voice message.

1348
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,048
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1349
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,969
I got in to Oxford.

1350
01:38:56,138 --> 01:38:59,057
It's very exciting.

1351
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:02,894
I came by your house a little bit ago
and I...

1352
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,562
You weren't there...

1353
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:08,191
...and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now...

1354
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:11,110
...because there's this early
summer class that I found out about...

1355
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,447
...and I thought that
it would somehow...

1356
01:39:14,823 --> 01:39:18,826
...be easier, I guess, this way.

1357
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:22,830
I think that maybe it's time...

1358
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,249
...to let this go.

1359
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,211
And that's not because
I don't love you.

1360
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:31,756
It's actually because I do, so...

1361
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,758
Okay, bye.

1362
01:39:48,273 --> 01:39:50,692
- We have to move, now.
- Why? What's happened?

1363
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:05,248
Remember me?

1364
01:40:09,628 --> 01:40:10,962
Oh, my, oh, my.

1365
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:13,172
How the tables have turned.

1366
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,134
I know it's hard to admit...

1367
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:20,722
...but how spectacular a move is this?

1368
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,559
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

1369
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:28,813
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother...

1370
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:31,858
...it is time to grant me a wish.

1371
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:36,320
- I want in to Special...
- How dare you come back in here?

1372
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:40,992
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective...

1373
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:43,202
...urchin freaks.

1374
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:50,960
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1375
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,641
Clear.

1376
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,021
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1377
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,942
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1378
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:22,116
The grid is all yours.

1379
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,818
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1380
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,242
What is all this stuff?

1381
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,993
The future.

1382
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:20,967
Load one up.

1383
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:26,806
It won't work.

1384
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:30,726
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1385
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,939
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1386
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,028
Do it. Now.

1387
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,701
You had it all this time.

1388
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,766
It's Spider-Man.

1389
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,856
Stop the cab.

1390
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,150
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1391
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,307
- Hi.
- Hi.

1392
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,768
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1393
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,688
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1394
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:22,732
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

1395
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,109
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you. "

1396
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:28,487
Because I love you.

1397
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:31,949
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

1398
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,035
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1399
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:36,620
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1400
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,874
And you're always gonna be my path.

1401
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,378
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1402
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,380
But I'm tired of them.

1403
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,302
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1404
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:53,721
We've all gotta make a choice.

1405
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,099
Right? Well, I choose you.

1406
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:00,978
So...

1407
01:46:01,229 --> 01:46:02,772
...here's my thought.

1408
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:05,733
England.

1409
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,402
Both of us.

1410
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:11,864
I'm following you now.

1411
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,241
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1412
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:16,786
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1413
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:21,165
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1414
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,084
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

1415
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,252
- Tons.
- They got...

1416
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,463
...Jack the Ripper.

1417
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:29,298
What?

1418
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:32,093
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper
yet. You didn't know that?

1419
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:53,322
What the hell is that?

1420
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,501
Is that Max?

1421
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,337
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1422
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,639
PNA 322, you are...

1423
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:21,058
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1424
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:23,644
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1425
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:26,397
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1426
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:28,566
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1427
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:32,570
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1428
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,656
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1429
01:47:35,907 --> 01:47:38,742
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1430
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:41,662
How will I stop him? Every time
I get close, he fries my web shooters.

1431
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:43,873
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

1432
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,167
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?

1433
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:48,878
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1434
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,297
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1435
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:54,592
If you magnetize a nail with a battery...

1436
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,886
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

1437
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:02,474
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1438
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,018
How do you hear?

1439
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,353
Approach, do you copy?

1440
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,564
Radio's working. It's not us.

1441
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:20,159
Do not panic. Everyone,
please return to your vehicles.

1442
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,286
Go back to your cars.

1443
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,954
Remain calm.

1444
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:28,000
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1445
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:29,710
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

1446
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:31,253
Spider-Man!

1447
01:48:31,504 --> 01:48:33,756
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1448
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:36,759
- I knew who he was. What can we do?
- Jumper cables.

1449
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,136
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1450
01:48:39,387 --> 01:48:41,805
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?!

1451
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:43,557
Yes.

1452
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:46,101
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1453
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:52,691
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1454
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:53,943
Okay, it works, good.

1455
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,861
That is why you were number two
at Midtown.

1456
01:48:56,112 --> 01:48:56,904
Rub it in. Okay.

1457
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,950
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1458
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,035
- You're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

1459
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,536
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming.

1460
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,206
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1461
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:11,418
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1462
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,920
Shut the thing.

1463
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:15,047
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1464
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:18,175
Peter!

1465
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:20,261
We still don't have backup generators.

1466
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,887
Get me Engineering!

1467
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,430
I need a respirator right now.

1468
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,516
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1469
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:26,934
Hang on.

1470
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:28,727
Okay.

1471
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,794
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1472
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:57,339
It's time to meet our destiny.

1473
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,898
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1474
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,651
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1475
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:20,321
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1476
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:27,369
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1477
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:30,873
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1478
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:32,833
- Time to impact?
- Four and a half minutes.

1479
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:34,209
Clock it right now.

1480
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:50,351
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1481
01:50:50,685 --> 01:50:52,353
I designed this power grid.

1482
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,188
Now I'm gonna take back...

1483
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,148
...what is rightfully mine.

1484
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,692
I will control everything.

1485
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:02,571
And I will be like a god to them.

1486
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:04,114
A god named Sparkles?

1487
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,751
Not this time.

1488
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,587
Is that all you got? Come on!

1489
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:38,857
Come on!

1490
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,321
You ready to give up?

1491
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,459
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1492
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,805
Just shake it off. It's just your bones...

1493
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:12,182
...and your muscles and your organs.

1494
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,312
Oh, boy.

1495
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:25,696
I hate this song!

1496
01:52:46,676 --> 01:52:47,676
Spider-Man...

1497
01:52:48,094 --> 01:52:49,428
...bet you never saw this coming.

1498
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:58,896
Really? You web me to a car?

1499
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,522
What are you, a caveman?

1500
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:01,982
You shouldn't be here.

1501
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:04,818
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1502
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:07,196
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs.

1503
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,739
I can reset the system!

1504
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,200
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1505
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,160
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1506
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:16,371
Nobody makes my decisions for me.
All right? Nobody.

1507
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,665
This is my choice, okay?

1508
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:21,793
My choice. This is mine.

1509
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:23,337
Now, how do we stop him?

1510
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:25,964
Okay, so he's electric,
he's like a battery.

1511
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,883
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1512
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:29,134
- It explodes.
- Right.

1513
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:30,969
So we use his power against him.
Perfect.

1514
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,055
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1515
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:34,765
But I need you to reset the system.

1516
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,893
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1517
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,479
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

1518
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,818
Go, go!

1519
01:54:38,871 --> 01:54:40,914
Sixty seconds to impact.

1520
01:55:15,533 --> 01:55:16,533
Now, Gwen, now!

1521
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:17,909
Do it now!

1522
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:44,686
Uni 687...

1523
01:55:55,823 --> 01:55:58,617
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1524
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:02,329
You have incoming traffic. I repeat: 280.

1525
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:03,872
Defend immediately.

1526
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,389
Yes!

1527
01:56:21,015 --> 01:56:23,225
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1528
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:24,851
I'll be back in a minute.

1529
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,646
Oh, thank God. All right!

1530
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:29,940
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1531
01:57:05,935 --> 01:57:07,728
I think we can still make your flight.

1532
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,696
Gwen, stay there.

1533
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,182
Peter.

1534
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:49,269
When you said Spider-Man said no...

1535
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:53,815
...you meant you said no.

1536
01:57:54,066 --> 01:57:56,485
Harry, what did you do?

1537
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,737
What you made me do.

1538
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,781
You were my friend...

1539
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:03,575
...and you betrayed me!

1540
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:04,993
No.

1541
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:07,370
I was trying to protect you.

1542
01:58:08,122 --> 01:58:09,372
Look at me.

1543
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,708
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1544
01:58:12,126 --> 01:58:13,376
You don't give people hope.

1545
01:58:14,086 --> 01:58:15,629
You take it away.

1546
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,922
No, Harry.

1547
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:19,466
I'm gonna take away yours.

1548
01:58:19,717 --> 01:58:20,967
No. Gwen, run!

1549
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,677
Harry!

1550
01:58:23,304 --> 01:58:24,638
Harry, put her down!

1551
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,365
Harry, stop this right now!

1552
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:46,326
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1553
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,829
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

1554
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,040
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1555
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:54,334
Fight me! Let her go!

1556
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:56,002
Okay.

1557
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:57,838
No!

1558
01:59:06,138 --> 01:59:07,347
You okay?

1559
01:59:12,728 --> 01:59:14,980
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1560
02:00:35,227 --> 02:00:36,144
Peter?

1561
02:01:39,875 --> 02:01:42,085
Hey. Hey.

1562
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:46,381
Gwen?

1563
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:50,051
Hey.

1564
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:51,553
Hey!

1565
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:57,475
Gwen?

1566
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,520
Hey.

1567
02:02:04,066 --> 02:02:05,108
Breathe.

1568
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:08,570
Hey, Gwen.

1569
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,572
Hey.

1570
02:02:14,326 --> 02:02:15,368
Hey.

1571
02:02:17,788 --> 02:02:19,080
You're okay.

1572
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:23,918
Gwen?

1573
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:31,342
Stay with me, stay with me.

1574
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,970
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1575
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:40,810
Gwen.

1576
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:44,564
Gwen!

1577
02:02:47,568 --> 02:02:50,111
No, please, please.

1578
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:54,032
Please.

1579
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:03,166
I can't do this without you.

1580
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:07,248
Leave us.

1581
02:05:11,545 --> 02:05:13,129
You've made progress.

1582
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,591
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1583
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:18,927
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1584
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:22,222
...this city will never be the same.

1585
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,016
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1586
02:05:25,267 --> 02:05:26,851
Speaking of progress...

1587
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:28,144
...you're looking better.

1588
02:05:29,104 --> 02:05:30,939
It comes and goes.

1589
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,108
Tell me more.

1590
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:36,236
How many men did you have in mind?

1591
02:05:36,487 --> 02:05:38,488
I wanna keep it small.

1592
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:42,158
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1593
02:05:44,036 --> 02:05:45,578
Access granted.

1594
02:05:45,829 --> 02:05:47,747
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1595
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,749
Who's our first volunteer?

1596
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,793
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1597
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:54,212
Currently serving a life sentence.

1598
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:55,672
He is...

1599
02:05:55,923 --> 02:05:58,174
...most eager to join us.

1600
02:05:59,009 --> 02:06:00,301
Good.

1601
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:02,971
Start with him.

1602
02:06:03,472 --> 02:06:05,014
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich...

1603
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:07,183
...was broken out of
a classified penitentiary...

1604
02:06:07,434 --> 02:06:10,603
...known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1605
02:06:10,854 --> 02:06:13,273
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity...

1606
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:16,693
...since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1607
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:20,196
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1608
02:06:20,447 --> 02:06:23,032
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department...

1609
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:25,285
...has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping...

1610
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,620
...for the return of the web-slinger.

1611
02:06:27,871 --> 02:06:30,039
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1612
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,792
Where is Spider-Man?

1613
02:06:34,086 --> 02:06:36,504
Too bad about that spider guy.

1614
02:06:38,048 --> 02:06:40,925
Too bad he's disappeared.
Seems like everybody really needs him.

1615
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,220
Where you going?

1616
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,099
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

1617
02:06:48,517 --> 02:06:50,184
Where you going?

1618
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:01,195
I don't know.

1619
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,158
You know, it's so funny.
I've been...

1620
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:08,745
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized...

1621
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:13,374
...and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1622
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:17,879
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1623
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:20,673
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

1624
02:07:20,924 --> 02:07:22,133
No. God, no.

1625
02:07:22,509 --> 02:07:25,636
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1626
02:07:26,513 --> 02:07:29,474
I'm just finding...

1627
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:31,893
...a better place for it.

1628
02:07:35,647 --> 02:07:37,565
I'm gonna take one last look...

1629
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:40,651
...and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1630
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:10,139
It's easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1631
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:14,227
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1632
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,605
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1633
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:22,568
And that's when hope is needed most.

1634
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:26,072
No matter how buried it gets...

1635
02:08:26,907 --> 02:08:28,991
...or how lost you feel...

1636
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:30,952
...you must promise me...

1637
02:08:31,203 --> 02:08:34,539
...that you will hold on to hope.

1638
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,500
Keep it alive.

1639
02:08:38,419 --> 02:08:41,045
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1640
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:42,755
My wish for you...

1641
02:08:43,006 --> 02:08:45,133
...is to become hope.

1642
02:08:45,592 --> 02:08:47,051
People need that.

1643
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,346
And even if we fail...

1644
02:08:50,722 --> 02:08:52,765
...what better way is there to live?

1645
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:56,102
As we look around here today...

1646
02:08:56,478 --> 02:08:59,689
...at all of the people
who helped make us who we are...

1647
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:02,817
...I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1648
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:06,028
But we will carry
a piece of each other...

1649
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,031
...into everything that we do next...

1650
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,703
...to remind us of who we are...

1651
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,373
...and of who we're meant to be.

1652
02:09:19,668 --> 02:09:21,836
I've had a great four years with you.

1653
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,088
I'll miss you all very much.

1654
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:47,570
Let's go! Move it.

1655
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:57,413
Get down! Take cover!

1656
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:05,546
I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.

1657
02:10:05,797 --> 02:10:08,007
A man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit...

1658
02:10:08,258 --> 02:10:09,675
...is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1659
02:10:13,722 --> 02:10:16,349
I am the Rhino!

1660
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,018
I told you I would be back!

1661
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:32,406
- No! No!
- A kid!

1662
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:38,371
Hold your fire!

1663
02:10:38,997 --> 02:10:40,623
Everybody, hold your fire.

1664
02:10:41,458 --> 02:10:44,544
- Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
- Civilian in our line of sight.

1665
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,549
Kid! You gotta get...

1666
02:10:51,718 --> 02:10:53,511
Look, New York!

1667
02:10:53,762 --> 02:10:55,596
Spider-Man is back.

1668
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:57,181
Leave the kid alone!

1669
02:10:57,432 --> 02:10:59,392
That's my baby! Please.

1670
02:11:02,437 --> 02:11:04,522
Brave boy.

1671
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,149
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1672
02:11:24,459 --> 02:11:25,960
Hey, Spider-Man.

1673
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:37,680
I knew you'd come back.

1674
02:11:38,181 --> 02:11:40,516
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1675
02:11:40,767 --> 02:11:42,852
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

1676
02:11:43,103 --> 02:11:45,813
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1677
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:48,608
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1678
02:11:55,657 --> 02:11:56,824
You fight me?

1679
02:11:57,159 --> 02:11:59,201
You fight me now?

1680
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:03,581
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere...

1681
02:12:03,832 --> 02:12:06,834
...I ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air.

1682
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:08,085
Never!

1683
02:12:08,337 --> 02:12:11,339
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1684
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,090
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1685
02:12:13,383 --> 02:12:14,383
Yes!

1686
02:12:14,635 --> 02:12:15,843
I'll be right there.

1687
02:12:16,219 --> 02:12:18,315
There's no place like home.
