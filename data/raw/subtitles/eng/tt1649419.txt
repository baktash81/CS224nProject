00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:03,767
<i>On December 26th, 2004, the deadliest tsunami
on record hit the South East Coast of Asia.</i>

2
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:09,642
<i>The lives of countless families all
over the world changed forever.</i>

3
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:16,782
<i>This is the true story of
one of those families.</i>

4
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:20,646
<i>...true story...</i>

5
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,472
Not again.

6
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:17,309
Did you... Did you
set the alarm before we left?

7
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:19,853
Yeah, it was the last thing I did.

8
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,402
No, I was the last one to leave.

9
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,987
I was the last one to leave
and I'm sure I didn't set it.

10
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:32,907
No, darling. I was the last one out.

11
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,617
And I did. I promise.

12
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:35,743
You sure?

13
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,203
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:44,751
No, no, I was the last one,
because I went back in.

15
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,503
And that means the alarm is not set.

16
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,296
- Because I didn't set it.
- Well...

17
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,006
I guess that means we'll be coming home

18
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,800
to a large bunch of hippies
sleeping in our bed.

19
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:54,426
What? Just like your old college days?

20
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:59,848
It's all right. It's fine.
It's just turbulence, Maria.

21
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,768
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

22
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,813
<i>we are about to begin our
descent into Phuket Airport.</i>

23
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,731
<i>The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...</i>

24
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,233
What are you doing? It's time to sit down.

25
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,568
- We're about to land, darling.
- Lucas won't talk to me.

26
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,445
<i>We ask that you fasten your seatbelt</i>

27
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,572
<i>and return your seat to the upright position.</i>

28
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,698
Take my seat.

29
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,159
What did I do? I didn't do anything.

30
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,746
It's all right. Just sit down
and stop worrying. Buckle up.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,626
Sit down, please, <i>madame.</i>

32
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,545
Lucas...

33
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,424
- Lucas.
- What?

34
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,801
You know, you could try being
a bit nicer to your brother.

35
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,011
He's just scared.

36
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,722
So what else is new? Everything scares him.

37
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:48,935
I wonder who he takes after.

38
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:14,583
All right.

39
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,544
Take your stuff. Don't forget all your bags.

40
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:19,630
Thomas! Your bag.

41
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:21,506
Have you been to Khao Lak before?

42
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,799
No, it's our first time.

43
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,135
This is the best holiday season ever.

44
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:28,346
All resorts are full,
but this area is really quiet.

45
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:29,555
It's great for families.

46
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,766
The Orchid Beach Resort is brand new.

47
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,893
We just opened a week ago.
You'll love it here.

48
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:34,977
All right.

49
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,105
I'm sorry, but we made
a booking on the third floor.

50
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:39,314
The Sea View Room.

51
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:41,566
I know. We are sorry.
That was a mistake.

52
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:45,070
But we feel you might like this better.

53
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:49,073
- Where do you come from?
- Japan.

54
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,533
You don't look Japanese.

55
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,077
No, well, I work
for a big company there

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,578
and we move around a lot. You know?

57
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,413
And you? You don't work?

58
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:58,248
I'm a doctor.

59
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:01,918
I'm not practicing right now.
Just taking care of the kids.

60
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,212
I see. You got promoted.

61
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,510
That's nice, isn't it?

62
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:11,802
- Mom!
- Yes?

63
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,220
Can I have one of these, please?

64
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,180
Lucas, if you're thirsty, will you just...

65
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:18,183
Drink some juice or a glass of water.

66
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,268
Exactly.

67
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,686
Boys, come and see this.

68
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,854
- Come on.
- Look.

69
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,859
Yeah, look. Look at this.

70
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:29,652
Isn't it great? Yeah?

71
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,112
Dad? Can we swim in there?

72
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:33,823
Yeah, we can go swimming. Yeah.

73
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:17,362
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

74
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:22,075
seven, six, five,

75
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,287
four, three, two, one.

76
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,705
Blast off!

77
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,891
That one isn't going up!

78
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,394
- Yes, it is.
- It is going up.

79
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,520
No, it's not.

80
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,022
It's going a different way than the others.

81
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,191
It's going all the way up now.

82
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,611
- It's catching up!
- Yeah, it's catching up.

83
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:05,407
No, Dad, it's going
in the opposite direction.

84
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:41,857
We got any of that wine left?

85
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,168
They're fast asleep.

86
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:07,797
Hey, baby.

87
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,049
Merry Christmas.

88
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:12,385
Simon, wake up, wee man.

89
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:14,136
Good morning.

90
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:15,512
Good morning.

91
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,265
- Get off!

92
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:19,391
Wake up!

93
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,726
- What are you doing?
- It's Christmas!

94
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:23,186
It's Christmas morning!

95
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,688
It's Christmas!

96
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,356
Coins!

97
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:29,108
The money's leading this way.

98
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,276
The money's going outside!

99
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,360
No, no, no!

100
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,197
Wait, wait! One at a time!

101
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,243
Oh!

102
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:41,578
A telescope!

103
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,787
It's the complete nova stars...

104
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,205
It's like, you can stick on your ceiling.

105
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,665
- It's the whole Milky Way.
- And then they light up?

106
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:49,794
Oh, look at this gorgeous scarf! I love it.

107
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,088
Thank you, darling.

108
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,214
That's all right, my love.

109
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:54,298
I mean Santa Claus.

110
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,424
What have you got, wee man?

111
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:56,717
- A ball.
- A ball?

112
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,928
- Come on! The ball!
- Yes, Thomas.

113
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,101
Oh, yes!

114
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,696
I can't get to sleep.

115
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:14,997
Must be jet lag.

116
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,416
Yeah. Sure.

117
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,505
Can we go outside and watch the stars?

118
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,425
Maybe tomorrow.

119
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:30,511
Shh.

120
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,974
Just close your eyes
and think of something nice.

121
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:56,452
One all.

122
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:57,911
- Mom!
- Hi.

123
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,746
Come play ball with me.

124
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,499
In a minute, darling. Play with Lucas.

125
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:12,967
Can't believe you.

126
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:15,427
- You're hopeless.
- What?

127
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:17,554
I'm gonna hide that thing
and forget where I put it.

128
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,390
I was just checking to see about the house

129
00:11:20,474 --> 00:11:22,893
- we put a bid on in Japan.
- Liar.

130
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,691
The truth is I got a text

131
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,276
saying that Yunioshi has been given

132
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,528
a two-year extension on his contract.

133
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:37,072
Which means there will be
two of us doing the same job.

134
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,782
And that can only really mean one thing.

135
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,867
They can't fire you.

136
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,828
That would be too expensive. Don't worry.

137
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,747
Well, I do worry because

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,457
we can't afford to lose this job, can we?

139
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,253
Hey, Dad! Come and play with us!

140
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,009
I could go back to work. Maybe it's time.

141
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,137
- In Japan?
- No.

142
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,223
Oh, you want to go home?

143
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,475
It's not the worst idea, is it?

144
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:14,148
Well, we should think about it.

145
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,192
But I'm gonna play with the boys now, so...

146
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:26,576
Here, Dad!

147
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,246
Dad, they are the worst trunks ever!

148
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,373
- Awful!
- They're awful, Dad!

149
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,500
- No, you're the awful!
- Yes, they are!

150
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,045
- Boys! Oh!
- Fish!

151
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:41,298
- Try to splash 'em!
- Ha, ha, beat you!

152
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,549
Lucas!

153
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,271
Oh, no!

154
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:58,856
Go get it, Lucas! Go on!

155
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:52,530
- Henry, the boys!
- Lucas!

156
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:54,490
Dad!

157
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,206
Lucas!

158
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,789
Mom! Help!

159
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:41,797
- Lucas!
- Mom!

160
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,008
- Lucas!
- Help me!

161
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:51,639
Lucas!

162
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,517
Help me! Help!

163
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,941
Get me out of this, Mom!

164
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,121
Lucas! Stay there!

165
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,499
Mom!

166
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,501
Hold on! Hold on!

167
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,835
Mom!

168
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:30,758
- Mom! Swim towards me!
- Be careful!

169
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,136
Grab that mattress!

170
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,640
- Lucas, grab that mattress!
- Mom!

171
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,310
Lucas! Swim!

172
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:45,980
Mom!

173
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:51,277
Mom!

174
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,446
- I want to go home!
- Grab my hand!

175
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:56,448
Mom!

176
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,337
Come on!

177
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:12,838
Grab on.

178
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,089
- Mom!
- Lucas!

179
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:23,139
Lucas!

180
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,350
Lucas!

181
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:26,684
Come on!

182
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:34,942
Lucas!

183
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,491
- Lucas!
- Mom!

184
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,328
Someone help! Someone help!

185
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:20,442
Lucas!

186
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:25,822
Lucas, go under!

187
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:55,766
Mom!

188
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:02,856
Mom...

189
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:04,232
Mom!

190
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:06,818
No...

191
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,323
Mom!

192
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:23,541
Mom. Mom.

193
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:29,005
Mom... Mom!

194
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:32,842
Mom!

195
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,095
- Lucas!
- Mom!

196
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,225
Never do that to me again, Mom.

197
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,854
Never do that to me again, Mom.

198
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,649
- I'm here.
- Never do that to me again.

199
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,610
We have to find somewhere safe.

200
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,613
It's okay. I'm here.

201
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,409
Mom...

202
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,703
Mom, look, that tree. That tree over there.

203
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,874
Yes. Yes. This is perfect. It's perfect.

204
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,336
Careful, Lucas.

205
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,714
Don't... Don't move.

206
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,843
Stay really still.

207
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,473
I thought I was a brave kid, Mom.

208
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,351
I'm scared.

209
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,020
Come here. Come here.

210
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,868
I'm scared, too.

211
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,874
Is it over?

212
00:20:58,212 --> 00:20:59,546
Is it over?

213
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,385
I don't know. I don't know.

214
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,018
Mom?

215
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,149
What?

216
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,985
You're bleeding, Mom.

217
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:12,863
- Oh, God.

218
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:37,970
It's okay.

219
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,972
- I can't see you like this.
- It's okay, it's okay.

220
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:43,767
Sorry. I just... Sorry.

221
00:22:47,604 --> 00:22:49,021
You go first.

222
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:32,144
That tree there, the big one.
Do you think we can climb it?

223
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:06,801
Okay, let's go.

224
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:29,030
- Wait. Did you hear that?

225
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,116
- There's nothing we can do.
- Wait...

226
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,285
We are almost there.
We have to get to safety.

227
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:35,619
No, we have to help that boy.

228
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:38,956
Mom, if another wave catches
us down here, we will die.

229
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,083
We have to climb that tree
right now. Come on.

230
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:44,753
Where are you?

231
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:47,297
Mom, look at you! We need help!

232
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:50,341
We cannot risk it.

233
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:54,470
We can't risk it, Mom. Come on.

234
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:56,847
Listen...

235
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:01,852
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?

236
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,687
What if they needed help?

237
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:06,105
You'd want someone
to help them, wouldn't you?

238
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:08,274
Simon and Thomas are dead!

239
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,168
Even if it's the last thing we do.

240
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,091
Where are you?

241
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:49,979
Look there, Mom! I see him!

242
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:03,658
Are you okay?

243
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,913
- Yeah, he's okay. He's okay.

244
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,002
What's your name?

245
00:26:17,004 --> 00:26:19,172
I'm Lucas. What's your name?

246
00:26:19,756 --> 00:26:22,050
- Daniel.
- Okay, Daniel. Okay, come on.

247
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:24,427
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out. Okay?

248
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:25,970
Lift him up.

249
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,805
- It's all right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

250
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:29,599
It's all right.

251
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:32,184
Are you okay?

252
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:10,511
Okay. Are you okay?

253
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,598
- It's okay, it's okay!

254
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:16,975
Don't worry. Everything's okay.

255
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,104
Okay? You stay here. I'll be back. Okay?

256
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:29,320
Mom, coming down. Just give me a second.

257
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:31,322
No. I can do it.

258
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:34,074
- No, Mom, I'm coming down.
- I can do it, Lucas!

259
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:37,411
Just stay there. Please.

260
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,552
Mom? Mom...

261
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,223
Okay...

262
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:03,448
Okay...

263
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:32,808
Thank you. Thank you.

264
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,878
Did you hear that?

265
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:16,055
Mom, look! Look, they're coming for us!

266
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,390
Hey! Over here!

267
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:22,602
Hey!

268
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:25,563
Climb down, Lucas.

269
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,986
- Lucas...

270
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,250
Lucas! Please...

271
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:55,007
No, no, no! God, please! No...

272
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,210
Lucas?

273
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:23,004
- Lucas?
- Mom, I'm here.

274
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:56,243
Thank you so much. Thank you.

275
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:03,416
Thank you.

276
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,169
Thank you...

277
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,674
Thank you. Thank you so much.

278
00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:18,972
My boys...

279
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:22,726
I cannot see them, my boys...

280
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:31,025
My boys.

281
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,459
Okay, Okay.

282
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,723
Don't let them take me
anywhere without you.

283
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,974
Don't worry, Mom.

284
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,434
I'm not gonna leave you alone. I promise.

285
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,231
Bye-bye.

286
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:21,196
Where's Daniel? Daniel?
Daniel. Lucas, where's Daniel?

287
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:25,658
- I don't know.
- Daniel...

288
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,905
Thank you. Thank you.

289
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:41,783
Thank you.

290
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,246
Mom.

291
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,378
Lucas.

292
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:58,090
It's so cold in here.

293
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:01,384
It's not cold, Mom.

294
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,223
Don't move.

295
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:10,643
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

296
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:14,396
I need some antibiotics.
Look in the cupboard.

297
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,693
Oh, God.

298
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:22,571
I can't read the labels. They're all in Thai.

299
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,197
There's got to be some English. Look...

300
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:28,159
Look on the sides. Look carefully, Lucas.

301
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,664
Thank God. Please.

302
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,917
See that boy?

303
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,754
I'm all he's got in the world.
Do you understand?

304
00:40:41,296 --> 00:40:43,590
I'm a doctor, too. I've got a lot of bleeding.

305
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,216
You've got to stop it, please.

306
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:48,428
I need some antibiotics. Please help.

307
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,494
Are you okay?

308
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:18,080
I lost my husband and two children.

309
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,376
If anything happens to me...

310
00:41:56,198 --> 00:41:57,825
What color is it?

311
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:00,118
- What?
- My leg.

312
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:03,538
Is it still red?

313
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,416
Yeah. It's still red.

314
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,335
- What does that mean?

315
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,713
It's good. As long as it doesn't turn black.

316
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,092
Here.

317
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:22,264
You need to eat something. Eat it.

318
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:30,438
You're so bossy.

319
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:34,692
I wonder who I take after.

320
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:47,578
Hello.

321
00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:51,082
What's your name?

322
00:42:55,627 --> 00:42:58,880
My name's Maria. And this is my son, Lucas.

323
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:01,299
What's your name?

324
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,056
Hey.

325
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:11,183
Give her some tangerine.

326
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,645
She must be starving.

327
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:26,197
Be careful.

328
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:28,616
- Be careful, Lucas.

329
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,243
Turn your head to the side, please.

330
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:32,370
You'll choke if you don't.

331
00:43:34,413 --> 00:43:37,207
Please, please,
she needs help. Turn her head.

332
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:40,168
Help her, Lucas. Help her. Turn her head.

333
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:43,713
- You okay?

334
00:43:44,964 --> 00:43:46,299
- You okay?

335
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,010
- Mom, are you okay?

336
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:52,680
Mom? Mom? Are you okay?
What are you doing?

337
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,350
- Mom, are you okay?

338
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:02,981
Stop it, Mom! That's enough! Mom, stop it!

339
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:05,150
- Mom...

340
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,111
Mom, stop it!

341
00:44:26,294 --> 00:44:28,046
Mom? Mom?

342
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:46,187
Francesca!

343
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:51,359
Francesca!

344
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:53,527
Francesca!

345
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,822
I need to go to the toilet.

346
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,616
Please...

347
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:05,330
Please...

348
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:11,210
Please.

349
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,212
- Lucas.
- Somebody help me!

350
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:17,382
Look at this place. It's so busy in here.

351
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,011
You've got to go and do something.

352
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,348
Go and help people. You're good at it.

353
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,684
What do you want me to do?

354
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,268
Something.

355
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,646
Anything.

356
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,566
Will you be all right?

357
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,359
Come on, Lucas. I'm...

358
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,445
I'm not going anywhere.

359
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:44,532
- I promise.
- Okay.

360
00:46:05,802 --> 00:46:07,053
Bernström!

361
00:46:08,888 --> 00:46:10,973
Three! Bernström!

362
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,102
Hello? Help me.

363
00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:17,104
Bernström! Bernström. From Sweden.

364
00:46:18,313 --> 00:46:21,441
- Your family?
- Agda. Josef. Mårten.

365
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:22,567
You're looking for your family.

366
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:24,444
Have you seen them? Bernström!

367
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:27,613
Okay! Calm down. I will help you. Okay?

368
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:31,784
Agda. Mårten. Josef.

369
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:34,328
I'll try and help you. Okay.

370
00:46:35,913 --> 00:46:36,914
Okay.

371
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,166
Agda Bernström?

372
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:43,044
Agda Bernström?

373
00:46:44,504 --> 00:46:46,339
Excuse me. Are you Josef Bernström?

374
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:47,799
- Or Mårten Bernström?
- No.

375
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,300
Mårten Bernström?

376
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:51,844
Excuse me? Excuse me.

377
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,847
I'm looking for my son.

378
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:56,098
Your son?

379
00:46:56,473 --> 00:47:00,644
Peter Berry. Yes.
He'll be wondering where I am.

380
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:02,479
Okay.

381
00:47:02,938 --> 00:47:04,355
Peter Berry?

382
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,985
Mårten Bernström? No? Agda Bernström?

383
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:11,487
Peter Berry? Josef...

384
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:14,865
Anna Marie?

385
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,283
Anna Marie DeBrauwn.

386
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:18,327
I'm sorry. What's your name again?

387
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,620
Anna Marie DeBrauwn, anyone?

388
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:22,914
Renata Castorini.

389
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:25,834
Tatiana. Tatiana Cherneshova.

390
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:29,670
Pah Chu Lihn.

391
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:32,590
Josef Bernström, anyone?

392
00:47:33,215 --> 00:47:34,883
Sang Sak is...

393
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:40,347
Agda Bernström? Renata Castorini?

394
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,689
Gunnar Diehl!

395
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:54,151
Anna Marie DeBrauwn?

396
00:47:57,863 --> 00:47:59,740
Mårten Bernström?

397
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:01,074
Ja.

398
00:48:13,294 --> 00:48:15,129
Mårten Bernström from Sweden?

399
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:16,380
Ja.

400
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,299
I know your dad.

401
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,259
Pappa?

402
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:22,969
Yeah, your pappa. He's here.

403
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:25,221
- I'll bring him here, okay?
- Yes.

404
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:26,306
No, no, no! You need to stay here.

405
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:27,390
Okay.

406
00:48:27,473 --> 00:48:30,184
I will bring your pappa here. Okay?

407
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:31,644
No! No, you have to stay here.

408
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:33,771
You have to stay here
because it's a very long way,

409
00:48:33,854 --> 00:48:35,272
and you have to rest. Okay?

410
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:37,483
- Okay.
- Okay.

411
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:00,962
Bernström!

412
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,330
Where's my mom?

413
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,833
Mom?

414
00:50:29,752 --> 00:50:30,836
Mom!

415
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:33,964
Mom!

416
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,970
No. No! What are you doing?

417
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:43,807
No, this is my mom's bed! Get off! No!

418
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:47,226
- Get off! Get off!
- It's all right.

419
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,562
It's okay. Take it easy, boy.

420
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:52,565
No! My mom was here, and she took her file.

421
00:50:57,903 --> 00:51:00,989
Look, you have to come with me.

422
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:03,491
I will help you. Okay?

423
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:05,869
Okay?

424
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:08,162
Okay. Okay.

425
00:51:48,866 --> 00:51:50,493
What's your name?

426
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:55,622
What's your name?

427
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:57,332
Lucas Bennett.

428
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:01,962
Where were you staying?

429
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:06,925
In the, uh, the Orchid...

430
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:09,969
The Orchid Beach Resort in Khao Lak.

431
00:52:10,636 --> 00:52:13,139
Was somebody else traveling with you?

432
00:52:15,307 --> 00:52:16,308
Lucas?

433
00:52:18,393 --> 00:52:20,812
My dad and my two little brothers.

434
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:26,651
Do you know what happened to them?

435
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,656
Is there somebody we could call?

436
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,741
Um...

437
00:52:36,326 --> 00:52:37,327
My granddad.

438
00:52:37,995 --> 00:52:39,454
What's his name?

439
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:43,875
Brian. But I don't remember his number.

440
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:52,535
Lucas?

441
00:54:56,622 --> 00:54:57,789
Lucas!

442
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,218
Maria!

443
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:13,471
Maria!

444
00:55:15,222 --> 00:55:16,598
Lucas!

445
00:55:20,435 --> 00:55:21,728
Lucas!

446
00:55:22,437 --> 00:55:24,022
Maria!

447
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:29,193
Lucas!

448
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,490
Maria!

449
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,924
<i>Hotel, we have
prepared transport for you.</i>

450
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:41,843
<i>We have to move to the Sangdee camp.</i>

451
00:56:42,677 --> 00:56:46,222
<i>Move, everyone, please.
You can't just stay</i> here.

452
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,157
Hey, man!

453
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,034
You all right?

454
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,494
I just need to lie here a minute.

455
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:12,538
I'll be up in a second.

456
00:57:12,621 --> 00:57:14,540
Don't even bother. They're sending trucks

457
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:16,083
to drive us all up to the mountains.

458
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,834
Just hang on tight, all right?
They'll be here soon.

459
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:20,587
Yeah, I know. Can you tell them I'm back?

460
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:22,714
Yeah, sure. Hold on.

461
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:32,473
Hey, boys! Your daddy's back!

462
00:57:32,556 --> 00:57:34,808
Dad! Dad! Dad!

463
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:36,643
Dad! Dad!

464
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:38,937
Hey.

465
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,856
Dad, a whole lot of helicopters just flew by!

466
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:42,816
- Did they?
- Yeah.

467
00:57:43,316 --> 00:57:44,317
Mom and Lucas?

468
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:48,446
Why don't you come down here
a minute, Thomas.

469
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:50,072
What about me?

470
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:51,240
You stay and see if you can see

471
00:57:51,324 --> 00:57:52,408
any more helicopters. Okay?

472
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:54,660
- Okay.
- Good boy.

473
00:57:57,829 --> 00:58:01,249
You're almost there, buddy. You got it?

474
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:13,260
I still haven't found them.

475
00:58:14,386 --> 00:58:16,722
Did you see a lot of dead people?

476
00:58:19,683 --> 00:58:21,977
What happened was very serious, Thomas.

477
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:24,229
Not Mom and Lucas, right?

478
00:58:24,312 --> 00:58:26,147
No, I didn't see them.

479
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:30,026
I burnt my feet on the roof.

480
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:33,112
It was really hot, and everyone was leaving.

481
00:58:33,195 --> 00:58:34,196
Oh.

482
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:35,823
Can we leave yet?

483
00:58:39,618 --> 00:58:41,286
I need you to, um...

484
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:43,830
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.

485
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,374
I've heard that everyone's
going to the mountains, you see,

486
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:48,292
to a shelter where it's really safe.

487
00:58:53,506 --> 00:58:54,798
But I can't go with you.

488
00:58:54,882 --> 00:58:56,967
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.

489
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,011
I have to keep looking for them, you see.

490
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:00,095
You have to look after Simon...

491
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:04,140
No! No, stay with us. I can't look...

492
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:08,019
I've never looked after
someone before. I'm scared.

493
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:11,355
I know. I know. I'm scared, too.

494
00:59:14,066 --> 00:59:17,486
But do you know the most scary bit for me?

495
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:21,531
When the water hit?

496
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:23,491
No. After that.

497
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:26,786
When I came up, and I was all on my own.

498
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:28,996
That was the scariest part.

499
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:32,875
And then I saw the two of you
clinging to the tree, and I...

500
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,376
I didn't feel so scared anymore,

501
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,128
because I knew I wasn't
on my own, you see?

502
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:41,174
What if Mommy and Lucas
are on their own right now?

503
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:42,425
Hmm?

504
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,219
Imagine how scared they'll be.

505
00:59:44,302 --> 00:59:45,261
We'll look for them together.

506
00:59:45,345 --> 00:59:49,473
No. Thomas, you have to look after Simon.

507
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:53,018
And I'm going to keep looking for them.

508
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:55,479
Okay?

509
00:59:57,898 --> 00:59:59,024
Okay?

510
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:02,485
I know you understand.

511
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,158
<i>Everyone move out.
You can't stand here.</i>

512
01:00:10,117 --> 01:00:12,495
<i>There might be another wave
coming soon. Move out.</i>

513
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:33,055
Hello? Yeah, I can hear you.

514
01:00:34,682 --> 01:00:35,808
Nobody knows what's going on.

515
01:00:37,142 --> 01:00:38,894
Are you all right? Have you lost someone?

516
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:40,896
We're fine. We just want to get out of here.

517
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:43,231
I'll call you back. Okay? Bye.

518
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:45,900
Uh, excuse me.

519
01:00:45,984 --> 01:00:47,485
I've been trying to place
a call back home all day.

520
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:48,569
I wondered, could I use your phone?

521
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,238
- It would be really quick.
- Look around you, man.

522
01:00:50,321 --> 01:00:51,739
Everybody's needing something right now.

523
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:52,823
But our battery is almost dead.

524
01:00:52,948 --> 01:00:54,450
We need the phone.

525
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:55,534
Yes, as I said,

526
01:00:55,617 --> 01:00:57,536
we are trying to clear the road, but...

527
01:00:57,619 --> 01:00:58,704
I understand, but I'd like to talk

528
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:01,331
to somebody in charge
who knows a little bit more.

529
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:13,008
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

530
01:01:13,092 --> 01:01:14,760
You're not coming?

531
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:16,762
I'm not coming, wee man, no.

532
01:01:16,845 --> 01:01:19,181
Thomas will take care of you, all right?

533
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:23,143
Listen to me. You're gonna
behave yourselves, okay?

534
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,436
And you stay with this group,

535
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,189
and I'm gonna be with you
just as soon as I can, okay?

536
01:01:29,649 --> 01:01:31,275
You're gonna behave yourselves, okay?

537
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:35,070
I love you.

538
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,156
Okay.

539
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:40,575
Will you look out for my boys
for me, please?

540
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:41,993
Come with us.

541
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,620
You know it's useless.

542
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:46,581
I can't stop looking.

543
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,627
- I love you.

544
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:53,462
I'll be with you tomorrow, I promise.

545
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,131
I love you.

546
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:16,900
Maria!

547
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,613
Lucas!

548
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,124
Maria!

549
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:48,179
- Oh!

550
01:02:55,936 --> 01:02:57,521
Oh, no. No.

551
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:16,288
Hey, man, are you okay?

552
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:19,583
Get in the car.

553
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:21,042
We'll drive you somewhere safer.

554
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,091
My wife didn't want
to come to Thailand

555
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,469
for Christmas holidays,

556
01:03:33,304 --> 01:03:34,972
because of my leg.

557
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:41,978
I insisted. My little girl, Gina,

558
01:03:45,398 --> 01:03:46,482
she's just two.

559
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:49,193
The noise woke me up.

560
01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:52,029
I was alone in the room.

561
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:57,493
I went out to the terrace
and saw the sea coming inland.

562
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:01,788
It took me five seconds to reach the stairs,

563
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:03,873
but the water was already there.

564
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,459
It was not more than five seconds.

565
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,505
On the bed,
I found a note from my wife,

566
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:14,008
saying that they were at the beach.

567
01:04:20,263 --> 01:04:22,474
You were at the Orchid, right?

568
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:23,641
Yeah.

569
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:28,855
Yeah, my whole family were in

570
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,607
the swimming pool when the water hit.

571
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:35,444
I found my middle son first,
Thomas. He was...

572
01:04:35,486 --> 01:04:37,988
He was at the top of this really tall tree.

573
01:04:39,114 --> 01:04:40,740
Took me ages
to convince him to come down

574
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:43,201
because he was so scared, you know?

575
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:45,411
And then I found my little one, Simon.

576
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:48,122
He was holding onto a palm tree.

577
01:04:49,415 --> 01:04:50,499
He's only five.

578
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:57,172
I sent them to the mountains.

579
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,341
You know?

580
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:03,178
So that I could keep looking
for my wife and my elder son.

581
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,767
Toughest choice I ever made.

582
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:13,437
- Have you called home yet?
- I can't find a phone.

583
01:05:19,943 --> 01:05:23,697
I'm saving my battery.
Just in case my family calls.

584
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:26,449
Please.

585
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:30,453
Thank you. I'll be very quick, I promise.

586
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,340
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Brian?

587
01:05:43,465 --> 01:05:46,175
<i>Yes, Henry, thank God. How are you guys?</i>

588
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:48,302
Did you hear from anyone yet?

589
01:05:48,428 --> 01:05:50,304
<i>No, Henry, you're the first to call.</i>

590
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:52,139
<i>Is everybody all right?</i>

591
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:55,809
<i>- Henry?</i>
- Maria and Lucas are not here.

592
01:05:55,976 --> 01:05:58,270
<i>What do you mean, "not there"?</i>

593
01:05:59,313 --> 01:06:02,440
The water came and swept everyone away.

594
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:05,109
And I found... I found Thomas and Simon,

595
01:06:05,193 --> 01:06:07,111
but I don't know where Maria and Lucas are.

596
01:06:07,153 --> 01:06:09,322
<i>Henry? Don't do that.</i>

597
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:11,157
And I don't know what to do,

598
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,617
I don't know where to look for them.

599
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:17,996
<i>Henry. Henry, calm down.
Henry? Henry?</i>

600
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,373
Brian, I have to go.

601
01:06:19,498 --> 01:06:21,958
Lots of people
need to use this phone, okay?

602
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,960
- I'll just call you later.
- Henry?

603
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:42,310
Sorry. I'm sorry, sorry.

604
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:46,022
Thank you.

605
01:06:59,284 --> 01:07:00,619
What do you want me to do?

606
01:07:00,702 --> 01:07:03,747
You can't leave it like that. Go on!

607
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:06,874
- Come on!
- Go on.

608
01:07:09,627 --> 01:07:11,754
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

609
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:16,425
I should call him back.

610
01:07:24,015 --> 01:07:25,683
<i>- Yes, Henry?</i>
- Brian, it's me again.

611
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,394
Look, I promise you
that I won't stop looking

612
01:07:28,436 --> 01:07:29,896
- until I find them. Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

613
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,063
I don't know what I'm gonna do

614
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,940
because it's nighttime now, but I'll...

615
01:07:33,023 --> 01:07:34,358
I'll look in all the hospitals.

616
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,484
<i>- Okay.</i>
- And I'll look

617
01:07:35,609 --> 01:07:36,819
in all the shelters and everything, okay?

618
01:07:36,944 --> 01:07:38,570
I will find them, I promise you that.

619
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,280
- I'll call you when I do.
<i>- Okay.</i>

620
01:07:40,363 --> 01:07:42,115
- Okay. Okay.
<i>- Okay.</i>

621
01:07:44,617 --> 01:07:45,910
Thanks.

622
01:07:51,332 --> 01:07:53,000
Can I go with you?

623
01:08:08,764 --> 01:08:10,099
I'm scared.

624
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:13,102
Close your eyes. Think of something nice.

625
01:08:24,362 --> 01:08:25,655
May I sit with you?

626
01:08:43,421 --> 01:08:44,798
How old are you?

627
01:08:47,258 --> 01:08:50,094
Almost 74. And you?

628
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,012
Seven and a half.

629
01:08:53,973 --> 01:08:55,808
Get these ants off me.

630
01:08:57,935 --> 01:09:00,520
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's asleep. He's fine.

631
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:03,189
He's got a bit of ant bites on him.

632
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:04,816
He's all right.

633
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,823
You like looking at stars, don't you?

634
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:16,285
I do. At home I can find
most of the constellations.

635
01:09:17,411 --> 01:09:19,955
But here in the sky, it's different.

636
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:24,167
Some of those stars

637
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:28,463
have been burnt out for a long, long time.

638
01:09:29,797 --> 01:09:31,507
Did you know that?

639
01:09:33,008 --> 01:09:35,094
They're dead, aren't they?

640
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:40,640
They're dead.

641
01:09:41,975 --> 01:09:43,893
But once they were so bright

642
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:46,938
that their light is still
traveling through space.

643
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,482
We can still see them.

644
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:52,485
How can you tell which ones are dead

645
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:53,944
and which ones are not?

646
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:56,488
Oh, you can't. It's impossible.

647
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,079
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?

648
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:05,788
Mmm.

649
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:33,105
Lucas Bennett?
Can you come with me?

650
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,156
Sit here.

651
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,382
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?

652
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,135
Yeah.

653
01:11:05,218 --> 01:11:07,345
And your mother's name is Maria Bennett.

654
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:09,639
- Is that correct?
- Uh-huh.

655
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,683
We'd like you to look at these things, please,

656
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:14,768
and see if you recognize any of them.

657
01:11:16,437 --> 01:11:18,105
Have a good look.

658
01:11:21,066 --> 01:11:22,651
Take your time.

659
01:11:39,499 --> 01:11:41,626
Does anything look familiar?

660
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:43,920
I don't know.

661
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:45,588
You don't know?

662
01:11:52,011 --> 01:11:53,345
I...

663
01:11:55,014 --> 01:11:56,807
Do you recognize anything?

664
01:11:57,266 --> 01:11:59,601
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

665
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,273
Lucas...

666
01:12:09,944 --> 01:12:11,153
Could you please come with us?

667
01:12:28,503 --> 01:12:29,837
Mom.

668
01:12:36,009 --> 01:12:38,136
Where the hell have you been?

669
01:12:38,637 --> 01:12:40,806
Where the hell have I been?

670
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:43,683
Where the hell were you?

671
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:46,060
You promised me
you weren't going anywhere.

672
01:12:46,144 --> 01:12:48,146
You weren't there.

673
01:12:51,107 --> 01:12:53,317
I thought you were dead, Mom.

674
01:12:55,736 --> 01:12:57,070
I'm sorry.

675
01:12:58,655 --> 01:13:00,657
I thought you were dead.

676
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:09,749
We're so sorry.

677
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,630
Someone must have changed
her records during surgery.

678
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:17,839
How is she?

679
01:13:20,675 --> 01:13:23,261
She's had surgery on her chest.

680
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,847
But she lost a lot of blood.

681
01:13:26,973 --> 01:13:29,976
She was too weak
to have her leg operated on.

682
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:32,853
She has to go back to surgery
when she recovers.

683
01:13:34,605 --> 01:13:36,648
But she'll be okay, right?

684
01:14:46,671 --> 01:14:48,381
Nothing. What next?

685
01:14:49,257 --> 01:14:50,758
We should, uh...

686
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:53,636
We should try and get a ride
to Takuapa Hospital.

687
01:15:17,824 --> 01:15:20,118
- Where are my kids?
- They're taking them away.

688
01:15:20,202 --> 01:15:21,620
They wouldn't let me go
with them. I'm sorry.

689
01:15:21,786 --> 01:15:23,455
- Where?
- I don't know.

690
01:15:43,473 --> 01:15:45,141
I need to pee.

691
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,435
You have to wait, Simon.

692
01:17:20,145 --> 01:17:22,147
Mom. Mom.

693
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:23,815
- Lucas...
- Wake up.

694
01:17:24,315 --> 01:17:26,734
Mom, guess who I just saw outside?

695
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:29,862
My leg. What color is my leg?

696
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:45,460
It's still red.

697
01:18:06,604 --> 01:18:08,147
Please. My mom.

698
01:18:08,231 --> 01:18:10,608
Her wounds are looking really bad.

699
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,029
We are doing the best we can.

700
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:17,948
We are taking your mom
to surgery right away.

701
01:18:35,089 --> 01:18:36,924
No more sick here since yesterday.

702
01:18:36,965 --> 01:18:38,133
It's full. We move out.

703
01:18:38,258 --> 01:18:40,218
No, no, no! Five minutes.
Give me five minutes, please.

704
01:18:40,302 --> 01:18:41,553
Please.

705
01:18:43,138 --> 01:18:44,806
I don't want you to slow down.

706
01:18:46,391 --> 01:18:48,768
These are the names of my
little girl, Gina, and Kathy,

707
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:50,978
my wife. She's American.

708
01:18:51,103 --> 01:18:52,063
Would you check the list for me?

709
01:18:52,146 --> 01:18:53,772
- Of course.
- Please.

710
01:18:53,856 --> 01:18:56,859
They told us our daughter
could be in Surat Thani.

711
01:18:56,942 --> 01:18:59,236
And we've already been to this hospital.

712
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:03,406
We have checked all hospitals
but this one. Please.

713
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:05,366
Five minutes, please.
Just only five minutes.

714
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,451
Okay.

715
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:09,078
I won't be long. I'll be right back.

716
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,469
Lucas.

717
01:19:28,137 --> 01:19:29,639
Lucas.

718
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:34,476
Anything left in the can?

719
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:43,068
Don't worry. I'll get you something.

720
01:22:00,735 --> 01:22:01,987
Dad?

721
01:22:03,613 --> 01:22:04,656
Dad!

722
01:22:06,658 --> 01:22:07,909
Dad!

723
01:22:09,952 --> 01:22:11,078
Dad!

724
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:17,793
Dad!

725
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:49,197
I need to pee!

726
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,490
- Can you hold it?
- No.

727
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,495
Simon! What are you doing?

728
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:04,627
Boys! Get back
on the bus right now!

729
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,046
Hurry up! They're gonna leave us here!

730
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:09,090
What are you doing?

731
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:34,738
No luck.

732
01:23:34,822 --> 01:23:35,989
Sorry.

733
01:23:40,785 --> 01:23:43,288
Sorry. And thanks for waiting.

734
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:45,582
Okay. We go now.

735
01:24:17,778 --> 01:24:19,321
Coming!

736
01:24:20,405 --> 01:24:23,158
- We're coming!
- We have to go now!

737
01:24:28,538 --> 01:24:30,414
Dad!

738
01:24:31,582 --> 01:24:32,708
It's Lucas.

739
01:24:34,209 --> 01:24:39,214
- Lucas!
- Lucas!

740
01:24:46,095 --> 01:24:48,389
Simon! Thomas!

741
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,058
Lucas! Lucas!

742
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:52,268
Lucas!

743
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:53,811
Thomas! Simon!

744
01:24:53,894 --> 01:24:56,146
Lucas! Lucas!

745
01:24:56,647 --> 01:25:03,403
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

746
01:25:03,486 --> 01:25:04,654
- Lucas!
- Simon!

747
01:25:07,407 --> 01:25:09,200
Searched everywhere...

748
01:25:21,878 --> 01:25:23,213
Simon.

749
01:25:23,963 --> 01:25:25,256
Thomas.

750
01:25:28,551 --> 01:25:29,969
Are you okay?

751
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:41,897
Lucas!

752
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:46,234
Dad! Dad...

753
01:25:46,317 --> 01:25:48,152
Dad. Dad?

754
01:25:49,862 --> 01:25:51,030
Lucas!

755
01:25:52,156 --> 01:25:53,157
Lucas!

756
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:55,034
- Dad!
- Lucas!

757
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:57,953
Dad!

758
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:02,457
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

759
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:06,127
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

760
01:26:07,378 --> 01:26:09,297
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

761
01:26:10,256 --> 01:26:11,298
I'm sorry I left you both.

762
01:26:11,382 --> 01:26:12,800
Dad, we did it.

763
01:26:16,929 --> 01:26:19,431
Let's go. No need to wait.

764
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:32,693
Are you okay? Are you okay?

765
01:26:35,696 --> 01:26:37,823
- Mom is here.
- What?

766
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:42,410
She's really weak. She says
some weird stuff sometimes.

767
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:44,454
The nurse says they're gonna
try and operate on her

768
01:26:44,537 --> 01:26:45,872
as soon as they can.

769
01:26:45,955 --> 01:26:46,956
I think it's serious.

770
01:26:48,749 --> 01:26:50,960
Mom? Mom.

771
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:53,629
Look who's here.

772
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:02,971
Hey.

773
01:27:05,056 --> 01:27:06,307
Hey, my darling.

774
01:27:07,266 --> 01:27:08,643
Hey.

775
01:27:15,232 --> 01:27:16,233
Mom.

776
01:27:19,111 --> 01:27:20,570
I thought you were all dead.

777
01:27:21,071 --> 01:27:22,906
We're all okay.

778
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:31,789
Am I dead?

779
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:32,957
No.

780
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,250
No.

781
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,091
It's okay to take this off?

782
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,468
Here, here, here. I've got it.

783
01:27:58,772 --> 01:28:00,899
- You came back.
- Yes.

784
01:28:02,651 --> 01:28:05,028
- You came back.
- Yeah.

785
01:28:07,113 --> 01:28:08,114
Oh, thank God.

786
01:28:08,906 --> 01:28:10,574
I can rest now.

787
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:21,501
Maria, what? What? What, darling?

788
01:28:22,794 --> 01:28:24,045
I'm dying.

789
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,797
No. No.

790
01:28:27,298 --> 01:28:29,300
You're going to be fine.

791
01:28:30,301 --> 01:28:32,303
Take care of our babies.

792
01:28:33,137 --> 01:28:35,639
Hey, that's not what I came here for.

793
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:37,224
You're gonna be fine.

794
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:39,351
They're gonna take good care of you, okay?

795
01:28:39,434 --> 01:28:41,895
I promise you, we're gonna be fine.

796
01:28:42,354 --> 01:28:44,898
Oh, Henry, I'm scared.

797
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:46,733
We're gonna be fine.

798
01:28:47,275 --> 01:28:48,943
Henry...

799
01:28:49,026 --> 01:28:51,946
Sweetheart, I promise you're gonna be okay.

800
01:28:52,279 --> 01:28:55,491
We're taking her to surgery.
We need to take her now.

801
01:28:56,617 --> 01:28:57,951
Okay.

802
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:03,540
I love you.

803
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:06,751
You're gonna be okay.

804
01:29:07,126 --> 01:29:10,171
I love you so much. I love you.

805
01:29:12,798 --> 01:29:16,260
I love you, Maria. You know that, don't you?

806
01:29:17,844 --> 01:29:20,388
I'm sorry if I let you down in any way.

807
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:10,893
Lucas.

808
01:30:12,103 --> 01:30:14,396
Thanks for taking care of Mom.

809
01:30:16,023 --> 01:30:18,108
We took care of each other.

810
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:26,074
<i>Dad?</i>

811
01:30:26,157 --> 01:30:27,617
<i>Yeah.</i>

812
01:30:28,576 --> 01:30:31,078
<i>There's something I didn't tell Mom.</i>

813
01:30:31,162 --> 01:30:33,998
<i>And I really need her to know.</i>

814
01:31:00,564 --> 01:31:02,607
I have a family, too.

815
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:08,488
I've been saving my strength

816
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,782
because I want to see them

817
01:31:13,325 --> 01:31:14,785
one more time.

818
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:09,252
Oh. Do you have to?

819
01:32:10,461 --> 01:32:12,880
We don't want you to feel any pain.

820
01:32:12,963 --> 01:32:14,381
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

821
01:32:14,465 --> 01:32:17,301
Shh. You're in good hands.

822
01:32:19,302 --> 01:32:22,138
Close your eyes
and think of something nice.

823
01:32:24,432 --> 01:32:26,392
Think of something nice.

824
01:33:00,048 --> 01:33:01,216
Lucas!

825
01:33:01,299 --> 01:33:02,634
Dad!

826
01:35:53,457 --> 01:35:54,917
Mom's okay, Lucas.

827
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,755
We're going home.

828
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:14,310
Be careful. You okay?

829
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:15,936
Mr. Bennett! Mr. Bennett!

830
01:36:16,311 --> 01:36:18,188
I'm Oliver Tudpole from Zurich Insurance.

831
01:36:18,313 --> 01:36:19,648
They sent me to take care of your family.

832
01:36:19,689 --> 01:36:21,149
You have nothing to worry about now.

833
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,152
In a few hours, you'll be at
Singapore General Hospital,

834
01:36:24,277 --> 01:36:25,528
where your wife will receive

835
01:36:25,612 --> 01:36:27,447
the best treatment in all of Asia.

836
01:36:28,573 --> 01:36:29,574
These people will take you onto the plane.

837
01:36:29,699 --> 01:36:31,283
I'll see you once you get there.

838
01:36:31,367 --> 01:36:32,743
Have a safe flight.

839
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:11,821
Okay.

840
01:37:15,824 --> 01:37:17,242
Where are we going?

841
01:37:20,036 --> 01:37:23,832
They'll take us to Singapore.
You'll be safe there, okay?

842
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:30,921
Please take your seat.
We'll be taking off shortly.

843
01:37:31,505 --> 01:37:32,673
Okay.

844
01:37:53,275 --> 01:37:55,611
- Can I just...
- Yeah. Okay. One minute.

845
01:37:57,112 --> 01:37:58,113
Hey.

846
01:38:10,833 --> 01:38:12,293
How are you?

847
01:38:14,295 --> 01:38:16,505
Here. With you.

848
01:38:21,551 --> 01:38:22,552
Mom.

849
01:38:24,846 --> 01:38:26,264
Guess what?

850
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,309
I saw Daniel again.

851
01:38:33,604 --> 01:38:35,272
He was so happy.

852
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:41,069
He was in somebody's arms.

853
01:38:44,114 --> 01:38:45,782
I bet it was his dad, Mom.

854
01:38:54,248 --> 01:38:55,249
I love you.

855
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,131
Lucas, I love you so much.

856
01:39:11,305 --> 01:39:14,475
Thank you. Thank you.

857
01:39:17,394 --> 01:39:21,106
I'm sorry, but you have
to go back to your seat now.

858
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,948
Fasten your seatbelts, please.

859
01:39:32,825 --> 01:39:34,159
I don't want to.

860
01:39:34,576 --> 01:39:38,413
Why not? You have to do
your seatbelts up in a plane.

861
01:40:32,755 --> 01:40:35,049
It's okay. It's only the plane.
