1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,961
<i>Talk to me, Ray.</i>

2
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,124
<i>Low on gas
and almost out of ammo, Johnny.</i>

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,761
<i>God damn it. This isn't supposed
to be happening in this area.</i>

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,723
- Retreat! Let's go!
- Move it! Move it!

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,529
To RP Tango.

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,047
Charlie Company overrun.
Requesting firepower.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,360
<i>Can't hang around, pal.</i>

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,283
<i>Gotta go home and refuel,
come back for them.</i>

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
<i>If we go, there'll be no one left
to come back for.</i>

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,245
- Move it! Move! Move!
- Retreat! Retreat!

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,682
<i>- We're hit!
- Mayday! Mayday!</i>

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,722
<i>Dragonfly 2 going down!</i>

13
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,122
Come on, Ray.
Let's go. Come on, Ray.

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,370
Come on, Ray, let's go!

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,563
Move! Move!

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,289
On your knees.

17
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,320
What's going on?

18
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,842
Hey, you will not.

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,322
No, you can't. No!

20
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,282
- No!
- You're all right, Ray. Just stay cool.

21
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,924
- You're all right.
- Johnny, help me.

22
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,648
No! Ray!

23
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,766
Here come the visa crew.

24
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,170
Log 'em in.

25
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,400
Murdock, Alvin.

26
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,203
Purvell, Robert.

27
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,011
Su, Joyce.

28
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,124
Rosenbaum, Naomi.

29
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,567
What the hell is that?

30
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,370
That is Kate Abbott.

31
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,722
The new security officer.

32
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,963
- VIP request. We need to process it.
- Okay.

33
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,562
- Sorry, Sally.
- What's the rush, Sam?

34
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,721
Security breach.

35
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,087
Everybody in the conference room in 10.

36
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,682
Nero Franks, Maltese national.

37
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,882
Over the weekend, he tried to board
an Oceanic Airlines flight

38
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,048
from Heathrow to Chicago.

39
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,208
Alarms went off
when Franks presented his passport.

40
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,767
It didn't have the new digital watermark.
Franks tried to run.

41
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,247
MI5 thought he was a suicide bomber
and took him out. Take a look.

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,561
Nero Franks was a scientist with no priors,

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,090
working for a German chemical outfit.

44
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,567
His specialty
was combustible gas munitions.

45
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,809
The Brits and the Germans are still looking
for a possible terrorist connection,

46
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,644
but no joy so far.

47
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,449
So here's the issue for us, people.

48
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,887
Now our enemies know
they can't forge visas.

49
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,366
That means they'll be looking
for ways to get real ones,

50
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,771
the kind you hand out every day.

51
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,207
We're working with
all the British security agencies,

52
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,645
but they're stretched really thin.

53
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,405
Budget cuts, plus they have
homegrown terrorists to worry about.

54
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,569
We're not saying that you have to
give everyone the third degree.

55
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,967
90% of our applicants are straightforward.

56
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,646
It's the remaining 10%
that I lose sleep over.

57
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,441
Any application that tweaks you
the wrong way, take it straight to Kate.

58
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,648
She excelled at this work in Washington.

59
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,967
What Sam really means is
you'll need someone to blame

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,691
if the wrong guy gets through, so use me.

61
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,923
What I'm really interested in
is anyone with scientific expertise,

62
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,247
specialists in chemicals or gases.

63
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,169
Any questions?

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,129
All right, gang. Back to work.

65
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,644
That's fine, madam.
Your visa will be ready tomorrow.

66
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,650
She's never seen the ball drop
in Times Square on New Year's Eve.

67
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,643
Have a good stay
in the United States, sister.

68
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,489
Thank you, sir.

69
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,731
So do you promise to watch me
when I'm on <i>American Idol?</i>

70
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,165
Oh, absolutely.

71
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,685
What?

72
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,720
- Have a good stay.
- Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

73
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,842
Dr. Balan, good afternoon.

74
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,091
I was told my paperwork is in order.

75
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,562
This won't take long.

76
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,364
Romanian citizen.

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,965
You have listed a medical conference
as the reason for visiting the United States.

78
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,041
Yes.

79
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,970
This conference is for pediatricians.

80
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,724
You're a general practitioner.

81
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,240
I work in a clinic
for newly arrived immigrants.

82
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,244
Many of my patients are children.

83
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,282
Dr. Balan, it also says that you consult
for Vicker's Pharmaceuticals.

84
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,085
I'm curious why we don't have
a letter from them.

85
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,326
I've only been there a few months.

86
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,762
- Is there a problem?
- I certainly hope not.

87
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,080
Let me see this file.

88
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm not done with my review.

89
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,727
A word.

90
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,684
You don't think it's strange that a GP,
who also happens to be a researcher,

91
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,603
wants to attend a pediatrics conference?

92
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,762
There's nothing odd
about moonlighting as a consultant

93
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,961
to make a few extra bucks.

94
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,441
Besides, Naomi already did
the background check.

95
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,369
- Balan's fine.
- I'll be the judge of that.

96
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,886
Look, I know you were a high-flyer in D.C.

97
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,445
I am not here on vacation.

98
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,131
Even when it's slow,
we're not processing people fast enough.

99
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,043
We're seriously understaffed.

100
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,122
So when paperwork
gets held up by security,

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,565
people start missing flights,

102
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,841
and I'm the one that has to
deal with their complaints.

103
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,968
Unless you wanna suffer
the Ambassador's wrath.

104
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,564
I'm doing my job, Bill.

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
We all are.

106
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,962
We have a problem.
A new security expert.

107
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,168
From Washington.

108
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,883
Her name is Kate Abbott.
She knows about Vicker's.

109
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,321
So no visa?

110
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,324
She's trouble, I'm telling you.

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,002
I'll take care of her.

112
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,810
This way, please.

113
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,489
Sweet of you to stop in.

114
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,522
There's something you need to see.

115
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,608
I'll have it done tomorrow.

116
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,686
Lisa.

117
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,761
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

118
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,087
It's okay. I saved us a bottle of bubbles.

119
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,844
Oh! You're the best.

120
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,167
So how did it go?

121
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,211
Would you believe I sold every damn one?

122
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,242
- No.
- Yes.

123
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,408
But I saved those for you.

124
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,284
I know you have
a thing for the underworld.

125
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,362
Thank you.

126
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,522
Oh, wow.

127
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,127
So all work and no play, huh?

128
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,805
It's complicated.

129
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,326
Is everything a state secret with you?

130
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,282
It's so beautiful.

131
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,282
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Naomi. It's Kate.

132
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,604
- I'm so sorry it's so late.
<i>- It's okay. Is something wrong?</i>

133
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,889
You remember a guy
you processed a while ago,

134
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,966
Sri Lankan researcher
by the name of Fazli Sameer?

135
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,284
<i>Uh, yeah, I was checking him out
when Bill pulled the file.</i>

136
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,726
Why?

137
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,485
<i>He said I had too much on my plate,
and he'd handle it.</i>

138
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,608
Okay, all right. Thanks so much.

139
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,131
Bye.

140
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,728
Actually, Dr. Balan
did ask me for a reference.

141
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,081
Request slipped through the cracks.

142
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll get my secretary to draft one today.

143
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,565
Oh, would it be possible to
see Dr. Balan's security clearance?

144
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,407
What's this really about?

145
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,241
- I just thought since I was here, it'd be...
- About that.

146
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,243
If you were even remotely familiar

147
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,090
with the British Defense Ministry's
standards on secrecy...

148
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,929
We're on the same side here.

149
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,731
You need to present
a proper written authorization

150
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,321
from the Home Office to even inquire
about security clearances.

151
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,244
- Dr. Perry, I...
- It's time for you to leave.

152
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,407
Get Inspector Anderson for me, please.

153
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,490
- Hey, Howie.
- Hey, sweetie. What's up?

154
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,961
Listen, I need the list
of this month's visa files.

155
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,121
Yeah.

156
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,724
There's no authorization.

157
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,166
Oh, Parker probably forgot to call.

158
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,811
Could you remind him?

159
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,324
Yes. Oh.

160
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,802
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye-bye.

161
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,369
- You wanted to see me?
- Miss Abbott.

162
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,967
I believe you know Inspector Paul Anderson
from Counter Terrorism Command?

163
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,041
Good morning.

164
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,681
Why are you making inquiries
into the security status

165
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,007
of a British resident, Dr. Emil Balan?

166
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,208
He applied for a visa
to come to the United States.

167
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,327
So you took it upon yourself

168
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,165
to go to his workplace
and interrogate his superior

169
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,202
rather than contacting my office?

170
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,970
Dr. Balan needs his visa today.
I just thought it would be faster.

171
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,527
- Not to go through proper channels?
- What's this about, Paul?

172
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,921
The director, Perry,
contacted me personally

173
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,449
to complain that Ms. Abbott
had been making unauthorized inquiries.

174
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,525
Then he called his friend,
the Home Secretary,

175
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,480
who asked me if you have issued the visa.

176
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,402
No, I haven't.

177
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,361
Is there a problem?

178
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,890
Ambassador Crane.

179
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,611
Inspector. Sorry I'm late.

180
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,091
I didn't know you were joining us.

181
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,847
I didn't either.
The Home Secretary just called.

182
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,451
So what's the problem?

183
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,764
I can't discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation.

184
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,526
We're talking about a medical professional
with serious political connections.

185
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,683
Is this really a matter
of national security?

186
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,441
Sam?

187
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,251
It's her call.

188
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,050
I'm standing by it.

189
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,926
I'll inform the Home Secretary accordingly.

190
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,445
But let me tell you something about Balan
that you probably don't know.

191
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
A few years ago,
his wife applied for a visa

192
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,970
for emergency medical treatment
in the United States.

193
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,246
She died

194
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,645
because some bureaucrat kept asking
for one more piece of paper.

195
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,563
Under the circumstances,

196
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,564
you might consider showing
her widower a little compassion,

197
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,324
Ms. Abbott.

198
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,801
Ambassador.

199
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,282
Congratulations.

200
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,369
You're already making enemies
in high places.

201
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,851
Keep it up.

202
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,447
Sam, get control of this situation.

203
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,921
Ugh.

204
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,641
You okay?

205
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,971
Yeah.

206
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,646
Thanks for backing me up.

207
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,845
You have great instincts, Kate.

208
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,204
Bill.

209
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,442
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

210
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,804
Sorry, Kate, I'll have to take this.

211
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,004
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant.

212
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,168
- All right, see you there.
- Okay. Gaston's, right?

213
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,845
See you there.

214
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,165
<i>You need to do it now.</i>

215
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,202
Okay, I understand.

216
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,645
Thanks, mate.

217
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
- After you.
- Thanks.

218
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,643
I think this is our table.
Classy. Look at that bar.

219
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,480
- Naomi, have you ever...
- This place is really nice.

220
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,930
That bar looks amazing.

221
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,169
Bill's crazy about this place.

222
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,811
What you told me last night
about Bill pulling that file...

223
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,282
Kate, it's the guy's birthday party.
We're supposed to be having fun.

224
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,486
Oh, um, he pre-ordered
the pressed duck for all of us.

225
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,211
- Okay.
- Um, we're six, please.

226
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,320
Wait. Did anyone remember
to pick up the present for Bill?

227
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,846
- What? That was you.
- I'm pretty sure...

228
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,410
Not playing a part of this.

229
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,280
- Don't look at me.
- All right, guys, pony up.

230
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,970
- Is this enough?
- I know.

231
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,481
It's like we're here for the free food.

232
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,930
Hi. I'm here to pick up a gift.

233
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,530
- That's beautiful.
- Yes. It's a great choice.

234
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,841
- I'll wrap it up for you.
- Thank you.

235
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,324
What's taking Bill so long?

236
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,684
All right, here comes the good part.

237
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,325
What do you mean?

238
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,646
Is that what we're eating?

239
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,370
That's disgusting.

240
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,050
Thank you.

241
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,131
Help.

242
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,285
Naomi.

243
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,890
Alvin!

244
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,041
Joyce!

245
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,726
Help.

246
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,881
There's someone hurt.

247
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,604
Abbott's still alive.

248
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,601
Where?

249
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,682
Following the embassy survivor protocol.
That's what they're trained to do.

250
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,444
Make sure she doesn't survive.

251
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,121
- What are you hearing, Sally?
- A restaurant blew.

252
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,004
The place looks like a killing zone.

253
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,280
Gas main explosion?

254
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,330
According to first responders'
radio chatter, it was a bomb.

255
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,567
I'm working on getting
security video feeds.

256
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,369
- Where was the hit?
- Just a few blocks away.

257
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,731
Do we have anyone in the area?

258
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,485
The visa crew took Bill
to lunch at Gaston's.

259
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,369
Christ. Waring Lane.

260
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,165
Oh, God.

261
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,882
- American Embassy.
- Right, sir.

262
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,130
- How long until this is fully out?
- Hours.

263
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,604
How many?

264
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,369
Four of yours, two waiters,
saleswoman from the glassware shop,

265
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,930
and five passersby.

266
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,969
And more than a dozen wounded.

267
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,441
The blast originated
where your people were seated.

268
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,490
- Has anyone claimed responsibility?
- No.

269
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,366
The bomb took out most of
the security cameras near the restaurant.

270
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,600
Don't know how much of
the feed we'll recover.

271
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,121
Is that all of 'em?

272
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,601
We found this in the shop.

273
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,407
Abbott must have been in there
when the bomb went off.

274
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,251
Do you think she's dead?

275
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,926
We can't find her.

276
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,489
Joyce, Robert, Alvin, Naomi,
they're all dead.

277
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,891
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

278
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,920
Bill Talbot was supposed to be
at that restaurant.

279
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,201
He stayed behind to take
a secure link call.

280
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,406
<i>If he was running late,</i>

281
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,171
<i>he should be somewhere between
the embassy and the restaurant.</i>

282
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,720
Get a lock on the trackers
on Bill and Kate's IDs right now.

283
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,963
Okay. That was the search team.
There's still no sign of Abbott.

284
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,764
So what do we know about her?

285
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,327
Only child, born and raised in Montana,
parents are deceased.

286
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,850
Stanford University.

287
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,042
Then a two-year scholarship
for graduate studies

288
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,491
at the University of London.

289
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,128
She applied to the State Department,

290
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,811
scored high enough to get into
the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

291
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,322
She single-handedly unraveled a plot
to bomb the American Embassy in...

292
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,284
Okay, so she knows the city
and she's good at her job.

293
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,482
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Well, she's better than good.

294
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,166
London's considered a senior posting.

295
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,804
She speaks four languages,

296
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,161
three of them being
Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin.

297
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,043
- Wait. She's CIA?
- We don't know.

298
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,048
Okay, until proven otherwise,
we assume Abbott is alive.

299
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,522
<i>That makes her a material witness
and quite possibly a suspect.</i>

300
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,406
<i>Get her details out to the police,
MI5, the media.</i>

301
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,209
<i>If she's wandering around injured,</i>

302
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,288
<i>surely a security camera will pick her up.</i>

303
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,850
<i>No, she'll know better than that.</i>

304
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,651
But put her friends,
especially that photographer, Lisa Carr,

305
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,205
under surveillance.

306
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,691
Abbott might reach out to her.

307
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,889
I had a lock on Kate's locator,
but the signal keeps breaking up.

308
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,884
<i>Kate knows we're tracking her embassy ID.</i>

309
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,969
She's following protocol,
heading for the safe zone in the park.

310
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,765
<i>- Talbot's already there.</i>
- I'll be there in two minutes.

311
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,523
- Kate.
- Bill.

312
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,131
- Thank God you're all right. Okay?
- Okay.

313
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,771
- Bill, they're all dead.
- I know, I know.

314
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,207
- All right, come here.
- Bill, I tried to save them.

315
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,924
- There's nothing left.
- Let's walk here.

316
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,321
- I tried to save them.
- I know. Relax.

317
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,683
There was a man with a gun outside.
He almost...

318
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,408
Why couldn't you
have left things alone, Kate?

319
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,251
Now I have no choice.

320
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,125
Kate...

321
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,445
Bill.

322
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,529
Look, look. Over there, see?

323
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,322
Danny! Come here!

324
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,450
Get away! She's got a gun!

325
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,041
It was an accident.

326
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,320
- He tried...
- Someone call the police!

327
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,204
Somebody help him!

328
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,044
Someone call the police!

329
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,367
Yeah, yeah, Lancaster Gate. Yeah.

330
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,525
Excuse me.

331
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,531
Damn it.

332
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,722
<i>Witnesses saw
Abbott holding a gun</i>

333
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,928
<i>and Talbot staggering toward the fountain.</i>

334
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,960
And this time, we have video evidence.

335
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,891
Please, Paul, give me a chance to find her.

336
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,405
I'm sorry, Sam. I have my orders.

337
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,401
Look, I know that you track your people
using GPS chips in their IDs.

338
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,244
It's how you knew
that Talbot and Abbott were here.

339
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,481
Hang on a second.

340
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,761
- Where's Bill's ID?
- I'm sure we'll find it. My point is this.

341
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,361
Assuming Abbott still has her ID,
you can find her,

342
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,410
and it's best I'm there when you do.

343
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,408
The kid's video went viral.

344
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,442
The Home Secretary saw it,
got on to the Foreign Office.

345
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,530
Now she's wanted for deadly assault
and questioning in a terrorist incident.

346
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,683
Kate has diplomatic immunity.
You can't touch her.

347
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,121
You know we won't take chances
with people like that, Sam.

348
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,291
Come in.

349
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,441
Who are you?

350
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,487
Trevor. I work with Fred.

351
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,321
I only work with Fred.
Shut the door.

352
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,089
He's ill. Do you want my help or not?

353
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,410
The signal is active.
You'd better hurry.

354
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,369
What's happening
with those trackers, Sally?

355
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,329
<i>Someone must have taken Bill Talbot's.</i>

356
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,680
<i>It's moved away from the park.</i>

357
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,566
At the moment,
it's stationary off Russell Square.

358
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,409
There's still a problem with Kate's.

359
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,801
The tracker must have got damaged
in the explosion.

360
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,649
<i>What's the last location we have for her?</i>

361
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,161
Lamb's Market off Curzon Street.

362
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,691
And you're sure no one else can track her?

363
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,888
Absolutely. Only you and me.

364
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,845
I need to get to her, Sally.

365
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,491
That's exactly what Anderson
is expecting you to do,

366
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,251
<i>and he'll be right behind you
with an SAS team.</i>

367
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,124
Kate knows what to do, Sam.

368
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,242
<i>It's more important
we find Talbot's tracker.</i>

369
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,921
<i>Whoever has it might be able to tell us
what really happened in that park.</i>

370
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,202
The fireworks in Dubai.

371
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,886
That was you, right?

372
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,731
Now you can follow

373
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,245
whoever has one of these.

374
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,925
And the second item?

375
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,369
Straight from the lab
used by the security services.

376
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,600
Dials you into their field agent
communication system...

377
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,761
You shouldn't have asked about Dubai.

378
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,209
<i>We're in the Italian Gardens on
the north side of Kensington Gardens,</i>

379
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,560
<i>where a short time ago...</i>

380
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,801
Sally.

381
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,720
<i>The Met has issued a warrant
for Kate's arrest.</i>

382
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,248
<i>...horrific explosion earlier today</i>

383
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,607
<i>at a popular restaurant not far from here.</i>

384
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,802
<i>This is Sam Parker. Leave a message.</i>

385
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,968
God damn it.

386
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,409
<i>And Bill Talbot's tracker
fell off the grid five minutes ago.</i>

387
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,729
<i>...taken by a witness here.</i>

388
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,610
<i>We can show you these images now.</i>

389
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,047
<i>There is a woman seen running
from the scene...</i>

390
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,009
<i>- Section 5.</i>
- Sally, it's me.

391
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,121
<i>Where are you?</i>

392
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,885
<i>I've been monitoring you,
but your tracker keeps shorting out.</i>

393
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,201
<i>You have to give me your location, Kate.</i>

394
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,170
<i>Kate? Kate?</i>

395
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,890
Damn.

396
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,763
<i>Sam, what's going on?
Did you find Talbot's tracker?</i>

397
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,081
- No, just a dead guy.
- What?

398
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,891
Talk to me about Kate.

399
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,122
<i>She called in two minutes ago,</i>

400
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,328
hung up before I could get a location.

401
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,004
Sam, you need to get back here.

402
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,684
The Ambassador's on the warpath.

403
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,045
He must have missed Abbott.

404
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,761
Tell the pickup teams to stand down.

405
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,888
Let's see what's so interesting
about that hotel.

406
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,287
What do I have
to do to convince you?

407
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,409
Oh, come on, please, give me a break.

408
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,250
Just one phone call.

409
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,247
Look, it was a present.

410
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,082
It's sterling, okay? Please.

411
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,326
- Local call only.
- Okay.

412
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,121
Hello.

413
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,287
- It's me.
- <i>Kate, oh, my God.</i>

414
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,771
<i>I've been watching the news.
Where are you?</i>

415
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,769
Lisa, please, I need clothes and money.

416
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,564
<i>All right, I'll go to your place.</i>

417
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,087
No, no, no. It's not safe, um...

418
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,327
Can you just come meet me
and bring me some of your things?

419
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,528
- Where?
- Somewhere where there's a lot of people.

420
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,365
St. Pancras Station by the Christmas market.
Two hours.

421
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,401
What's the composition of the gas?

422
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,327
A precise mixture of hydrogen,
methane, and fluorine.

423
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,125
The volume in New York will be
four times greater.

424
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,085
So will the results.

425
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,481
Made to the exact specifications
necessary to trigger this device.

426
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,607
I'm curious.
Why not use a detonator in New York?

427
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,367
At major events,

428
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,485
the police carry
beeper-size radiation detectors.

429
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,286
There's bomb-sniffing dogs, hazmat units.

430
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,206
If there's any sign of an alert,

431
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,648
even a false alarm,

432
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,968
the first thing the authorities do
is kill all communications,

433
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,524
jam radio frequencies,

434
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,564
shut down all cell phone towers.

435
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,410
Then we have the counter snipers

436
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,006
placed in a 500-meter radius.

437
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,447
However, I shall be firing
outside their perimeter.

438
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,643
Soon, my friend.

439
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,164
So now there's only the girl.

440
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,367
Just make sure my shipment
gets to New York, that's all I ask.

441
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,761
I appreciate that.

442
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,650
<i>The large gas explosion
ripped through the housing estate</i>

443
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,324
<i>- in Tower Hamlets.</i>
- Thanks.

444
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,802
<i>What have you got for me, Maureen?
The President is demanding answers.</i>

445
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,167
I just spoke with the
British Home Secretary.

446
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,083
They don't have her. Do we?

447
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,645
Abbott's tracker was damaged in the blast.

448
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,927
We lost her signal for the moment,
but even if we get it back,

449
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,803
the Brits have snatch teams ready to go.

450
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,242
If I try to make a move on Abbott
and happen to get lucky on her location,

451
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,645
I lead her right to Anderson.

452
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,290
Sam, she's a liability.

453
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,006
Kate had nothing to do with Bill's murder.

454
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,484
Go ahead.

455
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,450
This morning Kate took
the monthly visa list.

456
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,404
The flash drive contains
all of the background checks

457
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,130
and references on the applicants.

458
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,164
If we find there's been
a possible terrorist breach,

459
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,402
that's usually the first place we look.

460
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,641
- She said you'd okayed it.
- Did you?

461
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,441
No.

462
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,004
<i>What about the backup systems?</i>

463
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,001
Five files were permanently deleted
earlier today.

464
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,850
The entry log shows that
it was Abbott's ID.

465
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,531
It gets worse.

466
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,130
We checked the security log.

467
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,130
Abbott has been working a lot of nights
when there's no one around.

468
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,165
It's possible that she created documents
to get somebody into the country,

469
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,527
and then erased the records
to cover herself.

470
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,443
May I remind you that just five weeks ago,

471
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,568
you sent her over here
with glowing recommendations

472
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,847
because we needed the best.

473
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,611
If I recall correctly,
she was one of your protégées,

474
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,364
although I'm sure you'll deny that now.

475
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,689
I was skeptical at first,
but it turns out you were right.

476
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,321
- She's an extraordinary asset.
<i>- Yeah, just not for us.</i>

477
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,647
That's complete bullshit,

478
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,371
and deep in your scared little souls
you all know it.

479
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,400
We don't assume the worst
of our best people,

480
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,365
and we damn sure don't sell them out
at the first sign of trouble.

481
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,007
But most of all, we don't forget motivation,

482
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,530
and Kate's is sterling.

483
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,962
She lost some of her best friends on 9/11.

484
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,722
Then why is she still running?

485
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,001
She's on the move.

486
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,401
Where's Kate?

487
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,205
The last time we got a signal?
Leicester Square,

488
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,085
and that was 10 minutes ago.

489
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,043
It was barely registering.

490
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,770
Jesus, you look how I feel.

491
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,128
How are you holding up?

492
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,164
We're monitoring
Anderson's communications.

493
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,005
His people are looking hard,
but in all the wrong places.

494
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,124
How did it go upstairs?

495
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,766
They want me to try to bring in Kate,
use Anderson if I have to.

496
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,527
From Anderson's forensic lab.
Don't ask how I got it.

497
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,807
The bomb has traces of chromium.

498
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,642
- We haven't seen that since...
- Paris, two years ago.

499
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,051
The Watchmaker.

500
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,366
<i>Or whatever he calls himself these days.</i>

501
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,045
<i>Whoever wanted the visa crew dead
paid for the best operator in the business.</i>

502
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,649
<i>He's had so much reconstructive surgery,</i>

503
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,609
<i>no one knows what the hell he looks like.</i>

504
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,727
She's in St. Pancras Station.

505
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,446
I'll have to take the chance.

506
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,569
And where's Abbott's friend?

507
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,849
<i>She just turned off the Euston Road
into St. Pancras Station.</i>

508
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,201
All right, stay with her. I'm on my way.

509
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,883
<i>Please allow passengers off the train first.</i>

510
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,725
<i>Please allow passengers off the train first.</i>

511
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,527
<i>For your safety and security,</i>

512
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,769
<i>CCTV is in operation in every station.</i>

513
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,287
Code Lucifer.

514
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,647
<i>Repeat, code Lucifer.</i>

515
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,721
Lisa.

516
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,121
Suspected suicide bomber
at northeast entrance.

517
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,688
Okay, move.
Move, move, move, move!

518
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,642
- What's the matter?
- Did you bring the money? Did you bring it?

519
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,404
Kate, you've got to tell me something.

520
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,926
Stay here.
Don't move until someone tells you to.

521
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,807
What?

522
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,123
Kate. Kate!

523
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,250
Move! Move!

524
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,801
Move, move, move! Abbott!

525
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,567
You had your chance to help me, Sam.

526
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,362
Make sure he doesn't follow us.

527
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,726
Abbott!

528
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,048
There's no way out, Abbott. It's a dead end.

529
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,766
This way, sir.

530
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,161
Damn it.

531
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,769
It's this Way.

532
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,925
Abbott!

533
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,604
Abbott, stop!

534
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,126
Stop!

535
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,920
Stop!

536
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,651
Follow her!

537
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,165
Abbott!

538
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,524
No, this way!

539
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,286
- I think she went this way.
- Shit. Shit.

540
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,805
Shit!

541
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,086
Shit!

542
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,049
We can seal them off from the street.

543
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,124
What, you think she's gonna take
an officially marked tourist exit?

544
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,527
There are hundreds of other ways
out of here!

545
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,049
She could be anywhere.

546
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,361
What?

547
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,248
Jesus.

548
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,242
Fucking technology.

549
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,401
Bitch.

550
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,405
Sam?

551
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,244
Oh, come on.
You know I didn't do any of this.

552
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,485
Gotcha.

553
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,205
You sure it was the same guy you saw
after the restaurant explosion?

554
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,681
Yes, and he was in the park
after Bill tried to kill me.

555
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,569
So he could have followed you here.

556
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,125
Give me your ID.

557
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,640
We don't need anybody else tracking you.

558
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,600
You think he's tracked me
all this time?

559
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,407
Sam, who is he?

560
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,841
His code name is the Watchmaker.

561
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,406
He's one of the most wanted assassins
in the world.

562
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,566
You doing okay?

563
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,922
How did you know
I would come here?

564
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,281
I didn't.

565
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,249
I just came looking for answers.

566
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,610
What are we doing with our lives?

567
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,648
I put everything into this.

568
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,645
And what am I now?
A suspect? A target?

569
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,771
Maybe both.

570
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,046
We're doing this because we believe

571
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,329
in that old-fashioned
idea of country, right?

572
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,409
Or at least protecting our fellow citizens.

573
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,650
Our friends.

574
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,322
Right now,
I'm doing it to protect my own hide.

575
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,331
That's good thinking.

576
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,170
What's that?

577
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,168
It's the flash drive I got from Howie.

578
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,324
Last month we processed
over 600 visa applications,

579
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,330
and Bill personally intervened
in five of those cases,

580
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,731
including Balan's.

581
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,929
Now for each applicant he used
a different member of the visa team,

582
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,684
and when I started asking questions,

583
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,967
he ignored me, slammed them through.

584
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,571
So what's the connection
between the applicants?

585
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,329
I don't know yet.

586
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,364
But we do know Balan
is an expert in combustible gases.

587
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,362
Maybe Bill had the answer.

588
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,570
Bill said something strange in the park.
"Now I have no choice."

589
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,120
He must have kept some information
about the people he let in.

590
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,168
A little leverage, in case he needed it.

591
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,527
Who puts a padlock on a bedroom door?

592
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,682
Hello, my lovely.

593
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,726
God.

594
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,771
- Is this Bill's son?
- Yeah.

595
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,408
Johnny died in Afghanistan.

596
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,165
Something about this just doesn't add up.

597
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,080
It's like Bill was expecting him to
walk through the door at any minute.

598
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,091
Take it apart.

599
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,160
Everything.

600
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,965
Look at this.

601
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,562
<i>Hi, Dad. I'm doing okay.</i>

602
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,962
<i>Hope you are, too.</i>

603
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,930
<i>It'll be Christmas soon.</i>

604
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,084
<i>Wish we could be together.</i>

605
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,322
Johnny's been alive all this time.

606
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,000
- Do you think there's a chance?
- I doubt it. Look at his eyes.

607
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,324
He's swimming in dope.

608
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,643
Someone kept him alive for as long
as possible to get this footage.

609
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,485
But how did they know it was Bill's son,
or who Bill was?

610
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,007
They must have someone
with access to army records.

611
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,567
Doesn't have to be a major player.
A guy inputting data could be enough.

612
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,569
Once they knew it was Bill,
they threatened to kill his son

613
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,005
if he didn't give them what they wanted.

614
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,202
Which makes Bill's actions understandable.

615
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,523
But not excusable, because once Bill
got his people into the States,

616
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,480
it was only a matter of time
before he eliminated

617
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,488
everyone who handled the paperwork.

618
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,966
Then he got the bastard
who murdered them to come after me.

619
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,529
The Watchmaker would never deal
with low-level guys like Bill.

620
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,365
His business is with
whoever had Bill's son.

621
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,561
You said there were four others
besides Balan?

622
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,883
Yeah, and every single one of them
is in America.

623
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,727
We need to move now.
I'll get Archer to meet us out front.

624
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,041
Come on, come on, come on.

625
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,161
- What's wrong?
- Let's get the hell out of here.

626
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,605
Sam?

627
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,931
Kate.

628
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,611
Kate.

629
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,367
- Sally.
- Kate?

630
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,569
- Is Sam still alive?
<i>- Barely.</i>

631
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,322
<i>He's pretty badly hurt, Kate.</i>

632
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,562
Hold on. Anderson's on the scene.

633
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,768
He's coming on the line with Crane.

634
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,322
Madam Ambassador,
I'm at Bill Talbot's apartment.

635
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,329
Sam Parker's been critically injured.

636
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,851
Jesus.

637
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,968
Witnesses saw Abbott
running from the scene,

638
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,082
and we found her embassy ID.

639
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,080
<i>- Where is she now?
- We don't know.</i>

640
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,969
If you get her in your sights, do not hesitate.

641
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,240
Do you understand?

642
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,451
Yes, I do.

643
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,041
The longer she lives, the more people die.

644
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,201
Kate.

645
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,006
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.

646
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,805
<i>- They think you tried to kill him.</i>
- What?

647
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,286
That's insane.

648
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,364
I need to get into the embassy.
To the vault.

649
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,243
<i>The building's on total lockdown.</i>

650
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,243
- There's no other way.
<i>- Kate, listen to me.</i>

651
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,041
<i>- The place is crawling with marines.</i>
- You know I'm innocent.

652
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,367
And I know I'm right about this plot.

653
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,529
You have to get me in, Sally.

654
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,931
<i>- I'm at the north roll-up door.</i>
- I'm buzzing you in now.

655
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,209
I'm shutting down the cameras
in the stairwell and the vault.

656
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,924
In and out, as fast as you can.

657
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,804
<i>Attention.
Security breach at basement level.</i>

658
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,090
Oh, God. No.

659
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,881
<i>There's a terrorist headed for the States.</i>

660
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,485
Emil Balan.
He's traveling on a Romanian passport.

661
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,485
Oceanic Airlines, Flight 428,
out of Heathrow to JFK.

662
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,050
They have to stop him, Sally.

663
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,681
<i>We missed her.</i>

664
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,326
<i>She got herself a new passport,
and then wasted the hard drive.</i>

665
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,728
<i>The name she used, the passport number,
they're gone. She could be anyone.</i>

666
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:00,044
Get Abbott's picture to security at all
London airports and train stations.

667
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,366
Yes, yes, yes, what is it?

668
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,529
The purpose of your visit, Doctor?

669
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,404
Medical conference.

670
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,211
There's still time to stop Balan,
Madam Ambassador,

671
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,651
if you act now.

672
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,730
No. Don't you see what Abbott's doing?

673
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,122
She is trying to get us
to chase a shadow instead of her.

674
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,960
You're supposed to have left for New York.

675
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,243
I'm not sure I'm going.

676
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,443
What the hell are you talking about?

677
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,684
I found your reaction
to that little explosion quite instructive.

678
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,805
The way your eyes lit up,
the greed I saw in them.

679
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,804
Fortunes are made
when there's blood on the streets,

680
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,689
and very soon there's gonna be
a great deal of blood

681
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,240
on the streets of New York, won't there?

682
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,681
Just as there was after 9/11.

683
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,007
However,
when the New York exchanges reopened,

684
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:41,527
people who bet against the market
made a fortune.

685
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:48,091
This isn't an act of terror
or a bold political statement.

686
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,925
Balan may wish to avenge his wife's death,

687
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,002
but for you,

688
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,328
it's just about making money.

689
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,923
$100 billion is in play.

690
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,844
I would say the word
"just" doesn't quite fit.

691
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,121
If I stay home, you won't make a penny.

692
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,049
- What do you want?
- Half.

693
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,086
Half of your short-selling profits
on the New York exchanges

694
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,162
the day they reopen for trade.

695
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,361
Simple.

696
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,530
Is the girl dead?

697
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,441
Very.

698
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,724
<i>For security reasons,</i>

699
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,570
<i>please do not leave baggage unattended.</i>

700
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,804
<i>Baggage left unattended
will be removed and may be destroyed.</i>

701
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,971
- I'll grab these, too.
- Yeah, got it.

702
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,284
- There you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

703
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,401
Thank you.

704
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,808
Your flight boards in 15 minutes,
Miss Harrison.

705
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,881
Thank you.

706
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,886
- Good morning.
- Hi.

707
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,171
- Just one way, Miss Harrison?
- Yes.

708
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,847
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Death in the family.

709
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,491
- Safe travels.
- Thank you.

710
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,205
Now this is taking too long.

711
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,170
I'm doing the best I can,
Madam Ambassador.

712
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,002
Excuse me, ma'am.
You'll have to shut that down for landing.

713
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,491
Okay.

714
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,562
- Ma'am.
- I'm shutting it down.

715
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,282
Gonna get us both killed.

716
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,042
It doesn't make sense. Why Paris?

717
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,490
Abbott has no history there,
no friends to help her.

718
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,322
And why risk flying?
It's safer to take the Eurostar.

719
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,925
She's going to New York.

720
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,286
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

721
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,446
<i>This is not a normal breach.</i>

722
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,290
<i>Abbott is a security officer
and a serious threat.</i>

723
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,727
<i>- Find her.</i>
- Understood, Madam Ambassador.

724
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,006
- Hey, listen up.
- Ma'am.

725
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,209
- We got a red flag. Red flag.
- Let's go.

726
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:00,888
US passport number 212683550.

727
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,731
Suspect is traveling as Harrison, Amy,

728
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,121
coming off USS827.

729
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,329
Real name, Katherine Abbott.
Photo's on the way.

730
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,647
Jamieson, let's get the details
to Immigration.

731
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,451
- Miller, let's alert Customs and NYPD.
- Yes, ma'am.

732
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,406
<i>As soon as her picture comes in,
I want you to get it out</i>

733
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,245
To every taxi and bus driver
and the rental car agencies.

734
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,606
Stay alert, people.

735
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,730
Careful, ma'am.
You're in New York now.

736
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,251
Taxi, madam?

737
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,727
You're a Gypsy, right?

738
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,124
Madam, I'm an independent contractor
with 14 years' experience.

739
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,367
Okay. No medallion?
No radio either?

740
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,522
Please, I want no trouble with the police.

741
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,648
That makes two of us.

742
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,489
500 bucks for the night.

743
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,124
In cash, plus gas.

744
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,249
- It's New Year's Eve.
- Okay. Let's go.

745
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,408
I have an address in Lower Manhattan.

746
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,522
Red, increase 3%.

747
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,522
Green, maintain present level.

748
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,882
Yellow, reduce 1%.

749
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,722
Bit too slow, but maintain levels.

750
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,571
And stop.

751
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,282
Lock the cylinders.

752
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,090
Don't worry about the tanks or equipment,

753
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,804
but make sure you pack up everything else.

754
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,928
I'm going to look after the loading.

755
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,250
Take the BQE to the Brooklyn Bridge.

756
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,126
Very good.

757
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,601
You like TV? We have TV.

758
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,888
<i>This is a live shot of preparations</i>

759
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,129
<i>for tonight's New Year's Eve celebrations
in Times Square.</i>

760
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,011
<i>As you can see,
the famous New Year's Eve ball,</i>

761
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,924
<i>which is displayed year round,
is not in place.</i>

762
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,440
<i>It has been taken down
for some last-minute checks</i>

763
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,090
<i>on the new LED lights.</i>

764
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,205
Wait.

765
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,287
<i>It has almost 3,000
waterproof crystals,</i>

766
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,971
<i>ranging between four and five inches each,</i>

767
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,250
<i>and will be illuminated
by over 32,000 LEDs.</i>

768
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,009
<i>To prevent the ball from overheating,</i>

769
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,128
<i>a coolant gas is piped into the ball</i>

770
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,362
<i>just before it is attached to the pole.</i>

771
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,288
Change of plan.
Take me to Times Square.

772
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,761
Paperwork?

773
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,970
All right. You're good to go.

774
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,924
- Thank you. Happy New Year.
- You too, sir.

775
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,810
Can't you go any faster?

776
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,531
Go.

777
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,606
Sorry, ma'am.
This whole area is closed off.

778
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,964
Great. I'm just gonna get out here.

779
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,921
Thanks.

780
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,321
Oh, my God.

781
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,485
Ahh!

782
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,165
No. No.

783
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,080
Hurry.

784
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,451
Come on.

785
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,171
Can I help you, ma'am?

786
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,969
The guys that just came in,
where'd they go?

787
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,684
Uh, 1501.

788
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,041
Come on, come on.

789
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,604
Help! I need the cops.
Someone call 911.

790
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,922
We have to go.
We have less than five minutes.

791
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,601
You just had to be here.

792
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,610
I've been waiting 10 years for this moment,

793
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,120
to see the Americans pay
for what they have done.

794
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,089
- How far will the explosion travel?
- Not this far.

795
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,801
Good.

796
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,281
Ahh!

797
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,521
No.

798
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,810
Bitch! Come on.

799
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,125
Come on.

800
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,001
Fuck you.

801
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,211
Kate...

802
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,527
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

803
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,086
six, five,

804
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,647
four, three, two, one.

805
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,926
Time's up.

806
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,689
Happy New Year!

807
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,850
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

808
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,206
Abbott.

809
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,004
Abbott, it's for you.

810
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,241
Hello?

811
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,881
- I always liked your instincts.
<i>- Oh, Sam.</i>

812
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,445
You're alive.

813
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,961
Yeah. You, too, from what I hear.

814
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,525
<i>Mostly.</i>

815
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,604
So I guess this is what
we're doing with our lives.

816
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,011
Yeah, it is.

817
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,322
<i>Kate, there were over a million people
out there tonight,</i>

818
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,482
<i>and you saved them all.</i>
