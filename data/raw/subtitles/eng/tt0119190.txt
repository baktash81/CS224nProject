1
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:36,161
Deep in the heart of Africa
is a place no man has ever entered.

2
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:40,248
A place that belongs to the lion,
the elephant and the ape.

3
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,917
A place known as the Bukuvu.

4
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,838
Travellers flying overhead
can only glimpse at its many marvels:

5
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,257
its sparkling rivers...

6
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,553
its lush veldts,
its billowy cloud formations...

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,640
and its hidden mountains.

8
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,894
- Never fear, my friends.
- George!
- George!

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,937
- All was not lost.
- George!

10
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:07,192
Scraped and boo-booed,
they searched high and low...

11
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,196
but they never recovered
their most precious cargo.

12
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,163
George, George
George of the Jungle

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,374
Strong as he can be

14
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,878
Watch out for that tree

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,047
George, George
George of the Jungle

16
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,549
Lives a life that's free

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,762
Watch out for that tree

18
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,056
When he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

19
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,142
With help from his friend
an ape named Ape

20
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,561
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

21
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,564
He's man's best friend
He's George's dog

22
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,401
He's George, George
George of the Jungle

23
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,486
Strong as he can be

24
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,990
Watch out for that tree

25
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,034
Hear him holler
swing and sing

26
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,578
All the animals come
to the jungle king

27
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,539
George, George
George of the Jungle

28
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,708
George, George
George of the Jungle

29
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,127
So grab a vine
and swing in time

30
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,963
If you smack a tree
just pay no mind

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,841
Like George, George
George of the Jungle

32
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,010
Strong as he can be

33
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,389
Watch out for that tree

34
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:23,977
Watch out for that--
Bang! Ooh! Tree

35
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,816
George, George
George of the Jungle

36
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,985
Watch out for that tree

37
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,363
Twenty-five years later,
the bouncing baby boy...

38
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,284
has grown into
a swinging jungle king.

39
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,453
He is swift. He is strong.

40
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,872
He is sure. He is smart.

41
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,876
He is unconscious.

42
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,253
Meanwhile, 43 vines away...

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,840
George's kingdom was being threatened
by a terrifying intruder.

44
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,842
Hi, everybody. Me again.

45
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,262
Third day in Mbwebwe.
Look at this incredible--

46
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,433
- Banyan tree.
- Banyan tree. And look what's in it.

47
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,358
Could you die?

48
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,526
And over here...

49
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,905
is the outhouse, which you
don't want to see, believe me.

50
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,908
By the way, Betsy, thank you so
much for those moist towelettes.

51
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,327
They've been a lifesaver.

52
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,039
And these are the wonderful porters.
Wave, guys.

53
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,500
And this is our guide, Mr Kwame.

54
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,795
Without him, we would be lost.
Hi.

55
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,633
This is great.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,887
- And this is Lyle.
- Hello, Bujumburans.

57
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,016
- What are you doing here?
- What kind of greeting is that
to give your fiance?

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,395
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Yeah, of course I am.

59
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,941
The jungle loves you.
You're beautiful.

60
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,695
- How did you find me?
- Well, I just hired the two
best trackers in the business.

61
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,409
Ah, I'm chafing, Max.
Ah, yeah, I'm chafing big time.

62
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,413
Didn't I tell you not to wear 20 pounds
of black leather in the jungle?

63
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,581
- Didn't I tell ya?
- Ah.

64
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,459
Cotton, I said. Cotton breathes.

65
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,337
Take my things to the lady's tent
and shake a leg.

66
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,803
Later that night, Lyle Van de Groot
lost no time in making arrangements...

67
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,515
-to whisk his wayward fiancee back home.
-All right, I'll take it, I'll take it.

68
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,102
Nairobi Hilton.
They can airlift us there in two hours.

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,146
Pillows, okay?

70
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,399
Wait a second. I'm losing you.
Bad reception here.

71
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,027
Okay, I've got you back.
No, wait! I'm losing you!

72
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,863
My batteries are dead!
No! Doody!

73
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,906
I don't want to go anyway, Lyle.
Tomorrow we're gonna....

74
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:46,161
climb the mountain where the big apes
are. Don't you wanna see them?

75
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:51,916
Only if they can shake a good gin
martini without bruising it. Hiyo!

76
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:56,046
Me and Thor here would be happy
to help you and the lady up
the mountain, Mr Van de Groot.

77
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,507
- Yeah.
- With Mr Kwame leading the way,
of course.

78
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,093
If you don't mind me saying so,
the apes...

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,848
are supposed to be a fascinating sight,
especially that white ape.

80
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,684
White ape? What's that?

81
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,938
Ask Mr Kwame.
I bet he can tell you.

82
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:19,027
- It is only a native legend.
- Could you please tell us?

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,073
The people say he is
over seven feet tall...

84
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,533
with the strength of a lion.

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,161
When the moon is full
and the air is sweet...

86
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,455
he wanders alone
through the jungle...

87
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:35,210
piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call.

88
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,296
Now, some say he is
thirsty for blood.

89
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,426
Others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for...

90
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,929
but will never find.

91
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,558
By day, he rules the entire Bukuvu
from the top of the mountain.

92
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,727
But by night--

93
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,231
He and Bigfoot run the candy counter
at the Bukuvu Cineplex.

94
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,066
Now playing on all 14 screens:

95
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,360
Planet of the Apes.

96
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,702
Bigfoot? Max, that'd be worth
a lot more than any white--

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,414
- Ursula, what are we doing here?
- Lyle, I came all this way--

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,709
Okay, okay.
The things I do for you.

99
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,837
Looks like we're on, fellows.

100
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,297
As the sun rose
over Ape Mountain...

101
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,593
its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent
message to George by bongo-gram...

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,888
warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot.

103
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,057
Ooh. Lyle, listen.
What was that?

104
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,102
Could be the mating call
of the white ape.

105
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,563
Huh. White ape.
Sounds like a drink.

106
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,816
Uh, yes, bartender. I'll have
two Black Russians and a white ape.

107
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,111
A drink the venal Van de Groot
would be begging to imbibe...

108
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,115
if he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment...

109
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,368
flying through the foliage,
surveying the scenery, cruising in...

110
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:55,790
for a closer look and swinging on
through the trees with effortless ease.

111
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,916
Ow!

112
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,963
And so, onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged...

113
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,924
on feverish footsies
over perilous paths.

114
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,262
When they finally beheld the mighty
Ape Mountain, they reacted with awe.

115
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,893
- Aww.
- I said "awe." A-W-E.

116
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,520
- Ooh!
- That's better.

117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,733
Single file on the bridge.
Step very cautiously.

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,029
It is full of rotten planks.
One false move, you could fall over.

119
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,033
Then you will have
a very long time to wave goodbye.

120
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,869
Don't you worry, peanut.
I was on a bridge like this in Maui.

121
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,121
It was steady as a rock.
See?

122
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,749
Hey! S-Stop! Stop that!
Stop that! What th--

123
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,334
Yee-haw!

124
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,464
- I got you.
- No!

125
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,762
Don't worry.
Nobody dies in this story.

126
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,724
They just get
really big boo-boos.

127
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,268
What did I tell you?

128
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,730
You know, they shouldn't let
inexperienced guides
like that on these treks.

129
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,990
Did you see the look
that guy just gave me?

130
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,827
Probably saying I'm the biggest jerk
they've ever seen in their lives.

131
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,287
Probably trying to think
of something evil to do to me.

132
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,382
If they turn on us,
we're never gonna get home.

133
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,928
It's up to me to make the peace.
I'm going in.

134
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,848
Gentlemen. Cigar, cigarette?

135
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,143
Okay, gifts from America.

136
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,146
- Hey, hey.
- I give you a cigar,
you give me some of your lands.

137
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,108
All right.
A first contact has been made.

138
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,319
Ready, aim--

139
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,284
There you go, my man. Huh?

140
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,619
You like magic fire? Do ya?

141
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,456
Well, get a load of this.

142
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,753
There you go. Magic picture.

143
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,213
Yet another gift from America.
Here you go.

144
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,924
You're welcome.

145
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,640
Thirty-five millimetre.

146
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,443
Translation, please.

147
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,653
He says that he likes
your magic pictures...

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,491
but he prefers the resolution of
the Leica 35 millimetre transparencies.

149
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,995
He also says your lens is dirty, but he
has the equipment to clean it for you.

150
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,252
Well, tell him to clean this
while he's at it.

151
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,213
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

152
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,299
Find you an ape, so we
can get the heck outta here.

153
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,261
Lyle, we can't go into the jungle alone.
We could get lost out here.

154
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,888
It's my job to get you
what you want.

155
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,474
You want a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles...

156
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,227
you will get a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles.

157
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,605
You want a white ape,
I'll get you a white ape.

158
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,233
Here, monkey, monkey, monkey.

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,319
Here, gorilla, gorilla.
Come on.

160
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,160
- Don't move.
- You mean I actually found one?
It worked?

161
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,970
- God, that scared me.
- Scared me, too.

162
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,438
I'm gonna go get help.
You wait here.

163
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,166
Oh, no.

164
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,918
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

165
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,397
When lion brush last?

166
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,027
Don't tickle.
Don't ti-- No--

167
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,711
Rubber tree always good for clothesline.
Upsy, kitty.

168
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,766
George not even trying hard.

169
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:57,277
Flying pile driver.
Havin' some fun now.

170
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,030
Bad kitty!

171
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,550
- That close one, huh?
- Watch out for that tree!

172
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,844
Huh?

173
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,976
Oops.

174
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,232
Funny-looking fella.

175
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,743
White ape.

176
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,706
Y-- Y-- U-Ursula!
Ursu-- Wha--

177
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,632
Ursula, I found your scrunchie.

178
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,373
Go away!

179
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,086
It was horrible.

180
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,756
It was-- 400-pound
white ape man.

181
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:46,553
The white ape
has my girlfriend.

182
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,182
I held him off as long as I could.
Blood everywhere.

183
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,060
The white ape-- my girlfriend.

184
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,230
He-- He weighs 400 pounds.

185
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,817
The white ape got my girlfriend!
The white ape got--

186
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,987
Help! Help! Man needs help!

187
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,045
After a night
of feverish fantasies...

188
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,381
the perfectly permed heiress,
Ursula Stanhope...

189
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:28,345
awoke to the melodious music of the
Bukuvu bird life, and found herself...

190
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,973
venturing forth in search
of that defender of the innocent...

191
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,727
protector of the weak,
and all-around good guy...

192
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,063
George of the Jungle.

193
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,818
But that's not
who she saw first.

194
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,820
What!

195
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,077
Get away! Get away!
Get away!

196
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:08,802
- Hello. Oop!
- Oh, dear.

197
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,141
Feeling better, fella?

198
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,019
Okay. It's that dream, then.

199
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm still having that
psycho dream. Hello.

200
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,735
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, no, no! Don't worry! Ape friend.

201
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,904
- Ape make your breakfast.
- What does it want?
What does it want?

202
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:33,118
"It" wants its Physician's
Desk Reference, if you don't mind.

203
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,287
Unless you'd rather die
of dengue fever, of course.

204
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,582
That is very funny!

205
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,877
I thought I heard
the monkey talk.

206
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,131
But that is totally
understandable, right?

207
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,883
I mean, why wouldn't
an ape read textbooks?

208
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,511
And why wouldn't I find
myself in a tree house...

209
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:57,017
with room service and a Tarzan wannabe,
wearing a, um, um--

210
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,185
- What do you call that thing?
- Butt flap.

211
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,688
Right.

212
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,899
Ohh--

213
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,987
Ooh!

214
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:14,784
Bit of a shock, I suppose. Yes.

215
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,578
Fever.

216
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:22,083
Cold compress. Dab her lightly, George.
"Talking monkey."

217
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,795
That's the ticket. Good.

218
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,550
Huh? Somethin' funny
about this fella.

219
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,638
She's not a "fella," George. She's
a woman, the female of your species.

220
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,266
You mean Ape and George
not brothers?

221
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,603
Well, in a sense,
we are related.

222
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,230
After all, we're both members
of the primate family.

223
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,274
Primate family. Brothers.

224
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,611
I suppose one might claim
that there would--

225
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,698
Mommy, make that monkey
stop talking.

226
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,536
Perhaps I should refrain from speaking
around her, as it seems to upset her.

227
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,308
- What your name?
- Ursula.

228
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,520
Ursula Stanhope.

229
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,231
- Who are you?
- George.

230
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,942
George Primate.

231
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,654
And that brother Ape.
Ape Primate.

232
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,116
Ah! Oh, um--

233
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,120
Okay, I'm gonna
pass out again now.

234
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,330
Bye.

235
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,004
It's a sissy white ape.
I would've choked the life out of him...

236
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,257
except that he had two of his
lion buddies jump me from behind.

237
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,093
So in this version,
there are two lions with the white ape?

238
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,679
A minute ago,
there was only one.

239
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:02,475
H-Hey, the important thing,
Kwame, is that I was outnumbered.

240
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,105
Absolutely.

241
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,909
Ursula!

242
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:35,216
Hi. When I woke up this morning,
I remembered about that lion...

243
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,803
and I know you
saved me yesterday.

244
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,307
- And I just wanted to say thank you.
- Ah!

245
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,684
Ooh!

246
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,521
Now that I'm feeling better,
I realize the others must think
I'm cat food by now.

247
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,317
And I don't want my fian--
this guy that I was with-- to worry.

248
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,653
So, so I should probably go
and look for them...

249
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,614
and I was wondering
if you could help me.

250
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,784
Uh-- Ursula want to go already?

251
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,539
Okay, George help.
Get trusty doggy.

252
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,667
Oh, you have a dog.
That's great.

253
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,127
Doggy will help find friends.
George call Shep.

254
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,464
Shep! Here, boy!

255
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,008
Come on! Here, boy.

256
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,427
Shep!

257
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:25,433
Here comes Shep.
Come on, Shep! Come on, boy!

258
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,938
That a boy! Want to play?
Come on! Come on! Come on!

259
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,858
Good boy.

260
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:38,029
Come on, boy! Come on!
Good boy, Shep! Come on!

261
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,657
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

262
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,909
Sit. Sit.

263
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:47,080
Good boy!
Good obedience training.

264
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,708
- George trained from pup.
- That's your dog?

265
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,336
This Shep, George's big,
grey, peanut-lovin' poochie.

266
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,548
Good boy, Shep! Good boy.

267
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,217
Good boy, Shep. Good boy.

268
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:04,472
- That's a good boy. Wanna shake?
- Huh?

269
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,476
- Good doggy. Be nice.
- Shep.

270
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:13,898
Shake? George. George.

271
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,984
George!

272
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,784
- See? Shep shake.
- Oh, George.

273
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,954
He's a big poochie, all right.

274
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,123
Does he fetch?

275
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,463
Here, boy. Come on, boy.
Want a stick?

276
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,966
Want a stick?
Where's the stick?

277
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,261
Where's the stick, Shep?

278
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,347
Here it is.
Here, boy. Fetch!

279
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,060
Come on, boy!
Run, run! Run, boy!

280
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,980
Atta boy! Good boy.
Go on, boy! Go get it!

281
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,822
Where'd he go?

282
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,578
- Wow!
- No, not in the roses!

283
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,917
Ungawa, Shep!

284
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,045
And so, with the help
of the jungle king's big, grey...

285
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:20,215
peanut-loving poochie,
George and Ursula set out...

286
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:24,219
on a desperate search to find
her fianc-- uh, that guy she was with--

287
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,097
Lyle! Lyle!

288
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:32,102
- Ursula! Ursula!
- while he desperately
searched for her.

289
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,314
But by the end of the afternoon
her desperation had dimmed...

290
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,566
That was fantastic!

291
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,152
and she had given up
all hope of everything...

292
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,990
except enjoying the jungle king's
company from her precarious perch
atop his faithful doggy.

293
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,327
- So, where are we going now?
- To find Tookie-Tookie bird
for jungle news.

294
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,580
Tookie-Tookie bird.
I love that.

295
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,459
Later they rested,
while the tired tusker teethed on a--

296
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,838
Wait a second.
The dog bone is too much. Lose it.

297
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,007
That's better.

298
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,637
Bongo-gram.
What could it mean?

299
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,724
Tookie-Tookie!

300
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,690
Tookie say
little monkey in trouble.

301
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,775
George investigate.

302
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,695
Tookie-Tookie!

303
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:39,377
What happened?

304
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,339
- Oh!
- Where other monkeys?

305
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,591
Where? There?

306
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,302
How many? That many?

307
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:51,139
Lots of monkey.
Then what happened?

308
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,101
Tell George more.

309
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,312
No!

310
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,691
Little monkey say other monkeys
call little monkey "runt."

311
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:06,946
- Not let little monkey play games.
- Poor thing. Hi, monkey.

312
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,535
H-Hi. You okay?

313
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,579
No.

314
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,417
Don't cry.

315
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,213
Huh.

316
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,549
Little monkey like Ursula.

317
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,518
- What did you tell him?
- Just watch.

318
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,706
Uh-oh!

319
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:46,254
Meanwhile, back at a really
big footprint in the mud--

320
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,718
Let me through.
What's happening?

321
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,846
This footprint does not
belong to any of my men.

322
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,641
See? There's your proof.
The white ape does exist.

323
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:02,812
Now all we have to do is track down
the girl and the ape's in the bag.

324
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,815
N-No, seriously. I don't know
if I want to do this again.

325
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:09,486
Ursula need to relax when it come
to vine swinging, for George.

326
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,783
Swing, swing, swing.
Come on.

327
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,327
Want George of Jungle to tell you
special vine-swinging secret?

328
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,538
Fine. Tell me all your secrets.

329
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:24,334
George's secrets. Hm!
There's the shortest book ever written.

330
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:29,297
- Oh.
- Wrap it around your sock for
special George of Jungle foot lock.

331
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,884
- Now, ready to try again?
- No.

332
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:52,445
- Like this, Ursula!
- He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

333
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,949
Our daring young man
on the flying trapeze

334
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:00,495
- Look, no hands!
- His movements so graceful
All girls he could please

335
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:05,083
And with love
he is swinging away

336
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,962
- He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease
- That's pretty good.

337
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,340
- George, watch out for that...
- Our daring young man on the--

338
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:15,093
tree.

339
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the king of the jungle.

340
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,787
Where the devil is my egg timer?

341
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,540
- Tookie-Tookie.
- Tookie!

342
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:49,419
I'm fed up with this felonious fowl
stealing everything in the kitchen.

343
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,631
- Miserable creature.
- Tookie-Tookie.

344
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,885
George, what on earth
are you doing?

345
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,305
George just feel like looking
a little special today, that all.

346
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,976
Possibly there is a stirring
of special feelings within you?

347
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,899
Uh-huh.

348
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,118
George having stirring
of special feelings right now.

349
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,038
I see.

350
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:28,667
- Good thing she same species, huh?
- Yes.

351
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,711
Ape?

352
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:35,548
Tell George how to make
Ursula George's mate.

353
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:38,927
Please? Brother?

354
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:44,140
First, command her attention by bulging
out your cheeks and pursing your lips.

355
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:48,144
- Show George.
- All right. Just like this. Watch.

356
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,319
Even puffier.

357
00:28:56,486 --> 00:29:00,281
Next, display your interest
by drawing back your upper lip...

358
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,576
jutting your jaw forward
and exposing your teeth.

359
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:08,164
- Like this? Like this? Right?
- Now, throw a handful
of leaves in the air...

360
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:12,043
then leap about and hoot
in a dominant fashion.

361
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:19,843
-Like this, Ape?
-Good. She won't be able to resist that.

362
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,224
Ursula!

363
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,935
Gosh, this trail's really rough.

364
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,443
"Ursula! Ursula!"

365
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,077
- Hey, come back here.
- They're not abandoning us, are they?

366
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,287
They are threatening.

367
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,580
If you don't mind, Kwame...

368
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:52,876
I have a knack for getting
the most out of my employees.

369
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:57,047
- Do you mind if I address the porters?
- They only speak Swahili.

370
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:01,217
Well, I just happen to have
a Swahili phrase book.

371
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,636
Be my guest.

372
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,452
I think our troubles are over.

373
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:32,165
Tell them I'll pay 50 zamoles
a man if they'll help me capture
the white ape and bring him back alive.

374
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:36,336
Alive? After he, uh--

375
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,506
Well, he pulled Ursula's scrunchie off,
we know that much.

376
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:43,218
- 50 zamoles a man. What do you say?
- They only speak Swahili.

377
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:46,096
One hundred zamoles a man
and you got a deal.

378
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,224
- Hey, wait a second.
- Done.

379
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:53,978
Meanwhile, at a very big
and expensive waterfall set...

380
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:57,273
Ursula was amazed that she was lost
in the wilderness with a jungle man.

381
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,152
Here I am, lost in the wilderness
with a jungle man.

382
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:10,620
I should be terrified that no one
will ever find me, but I'm not.

383
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,542
- Thank you.
- For what?

384
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,044
For this adventure.

385
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,588
It's what I've always wanted.

386
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,884
King of jungle
only here to help.

387
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,852
Mr Boombastic

388
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,688
The awesome, boombastic
romantic, fantastic lover

389
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,942
Sade

390
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,194
Mr Lover-Lover

391
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,281
- Mr Lover-Lover
- George, are you okay?

392
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,867
- Mr Lover-Lover
- Your face is swelling up like--

393
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:52,203
- Ah, Mr Lover-Lover
- Is something in my teeth?

394
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,465
Okay.

395
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,680
Listen, um...

396
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:15,352
I'm gonna step outside
for a little air, okay?

397
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,568
- Are you sure you threw the leaves?
- Yeah, George threw leaves.

398
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,613
Well, cheer up, old boy.
I spent all day...

399
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,074
poring through every book
in the library...

400
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,160
and finally I found this.

401
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:37,332
It's positively packed full
of human courtship rituals.

402
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:41,044
Listen.
"What's a nice girl like you...

403
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:44,255
doing in a plane like this?"

404
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,181
Go for it.

405
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,815
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,198
What-- Oh.

407
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:17,997
- Did you fight a crocodile for this?
- Oh. No, George not fight.

408
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:21,001
Crocodile have toothache.

409
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:25,964
George pull tooth.
Crocodile give to George after. Gift.

410
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,424
Good juju.

411
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,469
- Juju?
- Good luck. Protection.

412
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,727
I have something like that too.
Want to see?

413
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,230
It's not worth anything.

414
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:46,317
I found it in a cereal box
when I was ten years old.

415
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,904
It's my good luck. My juju.

416
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,494
- Can l--
- Oh.

417
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,134
I want you to have that.

418
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,346
For George?

419
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:18,808
That's the nicest present
George ever get.

420
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,686
Thank you.

421
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,949
- All right, man.
- Yeah.

422
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:38,661
It dancin' time.

423
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:44,209
- Ursula, wanna dance?
- Oh, no. Thanks.

424
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,379
- I'd be too embarrassed.
- What mean "embarrassed"?

425
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:51,633
That's when you feel stupid
in front of other people.

426
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,302
You know, like
they're judging you.

427
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,263
- You've never felt that?
- No.

428
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,891
There are no other people.

429
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,310
- Good point.
- George not feel stupid.

430
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,313
Sometimes George smash
into tree, and sometime--

431
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,572
Sometimes George fall out of tree house,
but not feel stupid.

432
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,574
Something good
always happen after.

433
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:20,078
George just lucky, I guess.

434
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:24,958
One day I looked up
and there you were

435
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:29,295
No people here to look stupid for.
Just George.

436
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:35,010
Like a simple question
looking for an answer

437
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:39,639
Now I am a whale
Listening to some inner call

438
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,643
Swimming blindly to throw
myself upon your shore

439
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,481
What if I don't find you
when I have landed

440
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:52,986
Would you leave me here to die
on your shore, stranded

441
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:56,239
Think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

442
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:01,494
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

443
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:06,249
I sing dela, dela

444
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,546
When I'm with you

445
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,222
I burn for you

446
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,850
I've been waiting for you
all my life

447
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,894
Hoping for a miracle

448
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:30,732
I've been waiting day and night
Day and night

449
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:35,236
I've been waiting for you all my life
Waiting for redemption

450
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:40,033
I've been waiting day and night
I burn for you

451
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,633
And so it came to pass
that George of the Jungle...

452
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,345
attended his first co-ed dance.

453
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,522
But his rapturous rendezvous with the
urban heiress was to be short-lived...

454
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:16,194
as the very next morning, Kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close.

455
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:21,950
That is, dangerously close to shoving
a coconut up Lyle's sleeping bag.

456
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:23,952
That's it! I've had it!

457
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,206
I am the richest, smartest, handsomest
guy here, so I get to go first.

458
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,464
There's an elephant around here.

459
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:40,593
Bad guy falls in poop.
Classical element of physical comedy.

460
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,305
Now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh. Ready?

461
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,808
Ready.

462
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:54,482
Those were nowhere near
properly digested.

463
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:57,610
In case anybody's
wondering, I'm okay.

464
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,489
Have you cleaned my lighter yet?

465
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,375
Come on, come on.

466
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:18,214
That was Ursula.
Did you hear that?

467
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:21,051
She's alive. Ursula--

468
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:24,596
Why don't you bring on a brass band
while you're at it, you nit?

469
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,724
We gotta be stealthy here, right?

470
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,310
Stealthy. Right.

471
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:38,401
Party time.
We'll take it from here.

472
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,665
Get off!

473
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,756
It's him!

474
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:04,302
Hey, it's a dude. I told you
there weren't no white ape.

475
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,764
You dragged me all the way
up here to look at some guy
in a leopard-skin bikini.

476
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:11,434
- If I wanted to see that,
I could've stayed in Miami.
- Wait a second.

477
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:16,022
The white ape is a man?
Let me at him.

478
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:19,609
Hang on. Could you, uh, see
if he's dangerous?

479
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,779
Here, boy!
Where's my little doggy?

480
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,572
I've got a feeling he's not.

481
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,741
Okay. I'll go first.

482
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:29,619
If he gets aggressive,
I'll scare him off with this.

483
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:33,623
- I thought that was a lighter.
- It is a lighter,
but he doesn't know that.

484
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,382
Ursula, it's me.

485
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:47,387
Lyle. Your man.
I've come for you. Are you okay?

486
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,143
Ursula!

487
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,062
- Lyle, what are you doing here?
- Thank God.

488
00:39:56,229 --> 00:40:00,233
Mushy bear, you're safe.
I don't believe it!

489
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,738
Oh, I was so afraid
for your safety.

490
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:11,327
Lyle! Don't get all smoochy
and disgusting with me, okay?

491
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,747
I remember what you did
when that lion came.

492
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:18,543
What are you talking about?
I was fighting the lion the whole time.

493
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,838
You were just so terrified
you don't remember.

494
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:26,009
- I remember George,
that's who I remember.
- George?

495
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,345
Look over there.
What do you see?

496
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,058
- An elephant.
- But what has the elephant got?

497
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:40,273
- Fleas.
- Ivory! White gold.

498
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,611
Listen, Ursula, I have no idea what
you're talking about. Can we just go?

499
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,739
- George!
- Ursula!

500
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,783
Ready...

501
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,118
aim...

502
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:59,501
Run, Shep!
Run for your life!

503
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,670
Did that monkey just speak?

504
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,797
That monkey just spoke.

505
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,965
- I knew it.
- He talked.

506
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,051
- Shoot it now.
- Huh?

507
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:12,222
With the tranquillizer gun, idiot!
That ape's worth a fortune.

508
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,182
No!

509
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,935
Stop, or I'll shoot!

510
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:27,278
- No!
- No!

511
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:32,867
George!

512
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:37,080
Whew! Okay, kids, let's settle down
and review the important information.

513
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,374
Lyle is a big doofus.
Poor George was really shot...

514
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,127
but can't die because,
let's face it, he's the hero.

515
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:45,714
So, the naturally concerned
and preternaturally wealthy
Ursula Stanhope...

516
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,134
whisked George off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth...

517
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,262
where he would get the finest
medical treatment available.

518
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:56,433
I'm gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available.

519
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,729
As for those pesky, pernicious
and putrid poachers, Max and Thor...

520
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:04,190
they awaited their fate
in the Bujumbura jail.

521
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:06,901
You two, out.

522
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:10,280
- Acquitted?
- No, deported.

523
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,450
Meanwhile, Kwame and his men faced
the next-to-impossible task...

524
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:18,538
of picking out George's assailant
from a line-up of the usual suspects.

525
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,207
Too short. Too sweaty.

526
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:24,836
Wait a second! That's the guy.
That's the guy who shot him.

527
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,797
- I never forget a face.
- Me?

528
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:38,558
No, Max. Forget about it. I do not want
to listen to any more of your ideas.

529
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,937
You'll like this one. We're gonna steal
Georgie-boy's talking ape.

530
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:45,648
- You mean, back up the mountain?
- Thor, that ape is our ticket...

531
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:48,401
out of poaching
and into show business.

532
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:51,571
- No.
- Think about it. We got a talking ape.

533
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,656
What do Siegfried and Roy have?

534
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,159
- Sequins?
- Exactly.

535
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:59,245
Get ready for room service,
mate, and girls.

536
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,706
We're gettin' our ape
and going to Vegas.

537
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:05,085
By next weekend,
we'll be headlining at the Tropicana.

538
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,587
- Nobody is gonna stop us.
- Right.

539
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,507
George of the Jungle
must be halfway to Frisco by now.

540
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:14,260
Ah, but the plotting poachers
were only half correct...

541
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:18,890
for at that very moment, our handsome
hero was all the way to San Francisco.

542
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:22,268
- Yes, Mother, I'm safe.
- You're sure you didn't
catch dengue fever?

543
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,437
No, Mother, I did not
catch dengue fever.

544
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:26,856
- Well, how's your temperature?
- Normal.

545
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:30,193
- Colour of your tongue?
- Pink.

546
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,362
- What about your hmm-hmm?
- Regular.

547
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:35,573
Now, Lyle.
How is my darling future son-in-law?

548
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,450
Lyle is--

549
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:43,415
He's happy to be home, Mom.
Could you hold on one second?

550
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,799
George, please don't call any animals
into the car, okay? Thanks.

551
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:55,468
Mom? You there?

552
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:58,805
Mom, hold on. I'm losing you again.
George. George. No.

553
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,474
Are you paying any attention?
This is important.

554
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:06,855
No. I know it's important. Geo-Geo--
George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

555
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,942
This faster than riding big,
great, peanut-loving poochie Shep.

556
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:13,486
Love you, Mom. Gotta go.
Bye. Watch out for that--

557
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:18,199
Ooh!

558
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,250
So, what do you
think of my jungle?

559
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,961
This very high tree house.

560
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,339
Good place to call friends from.
Sound carry.

561
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:34,966
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

562
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:40,597
The neighbours.

563
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,225
- Give it a rest!
- We're ten storeys up, George.

564
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:47,604
I don't think the animals
can make it up here.

565
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:50,231
Oh, sure.
George know that.

566
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,360
George know that.

567
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:05,330
You must be tired. I'll, um...

568
00:45:05,497 --> 00:45:08,875
make the couch up for you
to sleep in the living room.

569
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:13,129
Oh, no. George sleep here
in tree house.

570
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,215
Okay. Good night.

571
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:20,679
Sleep sweet, Ursula.

572
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,056
Sleep sweet, George.

573
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:28,144
Ooh.

574
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,148
Well, Ursula's fiance
is in prison...

575
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:34,526
and there's a jungle man
sleeping on her balcony.

576
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:37,028
- She could use a best friend right now.
- Hi.

577
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:39,072
- Hi.
- I got here as fast as I could.

578
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,741
- Where is he?
- He's under the waterf--
He's in the shower.

579
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:43,743
Not any more.

580
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,745
- George.
- Oh. Bad waterfall.

581
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:50,166
First water get hot, then George slip
on this strange, yellow rock. Oh!

582
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,214
- Hi. George of Jungle.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

583
00:45:56,381 --> 00:46:00,719
George.
Um, take this big book.

584
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:04,347
Whoop! Cover the booty,
get into decent clothes.

585
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,057
- Sorry, Betsy.
- Bye.
- No problem.

586
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:09,728
- Okay.
- I see why they made him
king of the jungle.

587
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,938
Betsy, I am
in trouble here, okay?

588
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,358
How am I gonna tell my parents
that my fiance's in an African jail...

589
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,318
and that I brought home
a jungle man?

590
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:20,030
You are totally stuck
on George, huh?

591
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:22,949
No, I am not!

592
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:27,370
-Can I have him then?
-Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.

593
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,540
Think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think.
What am I gonna do about tomorrow?

594
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:33,585
Tomorrow is your engagement party,
and unless they give day passes...

595
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:36,755
out of Bujumbura Jail,
Lyle is not likely to attend.

596
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:40,550
So tell 'em the truth and don't
worry about it and take George.

597
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,887
- He can back up your story. Right?
- Yeah. All right.

598
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,097
So I'll tell my dad
first thing in the morning.

599
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:50,226
Make it second thing. First thing, l
suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.

600
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:57,734
Nice butt flap.

601
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:05,909
Being of a conservative mind
regarding gender roles...

602
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,078
Ursula Stanhope
wasted no time...

603
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:11,748
in taking George of the Jungle
to a fine haberdasher.

604
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:19,756
- And this is Neiman Marcus.
- Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.

605
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:24,177
Hello. Would you like
to sample our new fragrance?

606
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,262
Thank you.

607
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:36,356
Later, in the men's department, after
discovering his long-lost brothers...

608
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:41,069
the jungle king was pleased to find
he looked pretty good in Armani.

609
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:43,822
Pretty darn good.

610
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,159
Watch out, man!

611
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:51,746
Why everyone run around crazy,
like antelope in mating season?

612
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:55,125
They're just trying to make a living.
It's-- different kind
of jungle here, George.

613
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,961
It's survival of the fittest.
Dog eat dog.

614
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:01,339
- "Dog eat dog"-- Dog eat dog here?
- No, that's not what I meant.

615
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,466
George never bring Shep here.
Uh-uh. Never.

616
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:07,220
Every story gets to have a really big
coincidence, and here's ours.

617
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,682
Who should see them walking down
the street but Ursula's meddling mother?

618
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,851
Uh, yes, uh, Lyle Van de Groot,
please.

619
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:16,062
- I'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.
- He's not?

620
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:18,189
No. I'm sorry.

621
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,734
Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...

622
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,071
George's friends were going positively
ga-ga from missing the jungle king.

623
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:26,906
No!

624
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:30,243
Oh, look at this.
It's ruined. Ruined!

625
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,037
Shep, come here at once.

626
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:35,040
Come on!

627
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:41,087
How many times do I have to tell you?
My violin bow is not a chew toy!

628
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:42,839
Bad dog!

629
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:46,259
And you! Out of my sight,
you feathered fool.

630
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:52,515
No! Not on the tree house!
I'll smack you--

631
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,604
Ursula, it's Mother.
Pick up the phone...

632
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,899
and tell me who that man was
I saw you strolling with today.

633
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:05,070
And where is Lyle?
We must discuss the engagement party.

634
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:10,241
I know you're there, Ursula.
Pick up the phone and tell me
why you have been avoiding me.

635
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:12,744
Pick up the phone!

636
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:18,625
Well, I think that
was an overreaction.

637
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:22,295
Just make sure you stay here
while I'm at work...

638
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:26,883
and you can watch TV
and eat and relax.

639
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,344
And I'll be back as soon as I can.
Just stay here.

640
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:34,641
"Stay here"? George is king
of the jungle. No four walls built
by modern man can contain him.

641
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:38,937
Not true. George have every intention
of doing exactly what Ursula say.

642
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:43,942
- Really? Is that so?
- For a while.

643
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:49,948
And at that very moment,
Betsy and Ursula were on their way to
break the news about Lyle to her father.

644
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,659
- Good luck, kiddo.
- Surprise!

645
00:49:57,122 --> 00:50:00,625
Ursula, welcome home,
sweetheart...

646
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,836
and happy engagement day.

647
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,213
Chock Full O' Nuts

648
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,967
The heavenly coffee

649
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:13,138
- The coffee that brings you together.
- When you're in love

650
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:19,978
Now George understand. George get
coffee, then Ursula want George.

651
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:34,993
Java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java.

652
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,413
So the low has moved offshore.
High pressure's built a ridge in.

653
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,665
The weather
is absolutely gorgeous.

654
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,335
- If you're not outside, you oughta be!
- Who, me?

655
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:45,795
- I mean you.
- Oh.

656
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:47,672
Okay!

657
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,258
And so, jazzed on java...

658
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:54,054
George of the Jungle made his way
into the city by the bay.

659
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,516
Whoo!

660
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:01,186
Quickly taking to tourism,
the jungle king enjoyed...

661
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,521
the first drive-through
dining of his life...

662
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:06,983
and strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating...

663
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,152
- he had to say:
- Ooh!

664
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,915
But nothing excited
the jungle king more...

665
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,001
than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen.

666
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:28,755
Ooh. Yeah.

667
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,444
- Help!
- Ooh.

668
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,530
Somebody help!

669
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:10,422
- To swing or not to swing?
- Help!

670
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,677
Swing.

671
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:29,941
As the king of the jungle
quickly calculated the angle
and velocity of his next big swing...

672
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:32,944
Ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself.

673
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:37,240
I feel so guilty.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

674
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:41,578
First thing: I suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him.

675
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,913
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, honey. Take a look at this.

676
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,459
The most remarkable thing
is happening on the Bay Bridge.

677
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:50,462
...where strong winds
have carried him to the Bay Bridge.

678
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:52,630
Our own Valerie Devlin
is live on the scene. Valerie?

679
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,717
Thank you, Terilyn.
We do have a breaking story...

680
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:58,261
- at the Bay Bridge...
- Help!
- where a parasailor dangles...

681
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:02,349
- helplessly, 500 feet above the water.
- Please! Hurry up! Help!

682
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,813
There's no word on who
this lone daredevil is.

683
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,650
- That's George.
- He appears to have some kind
of rope in his hand.

684
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,944
- He might be preparing to swing on it.
- I gotta go.

685
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,840
Excuse me, sir.
I have to get on this boat.

686
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:50,897
Hey, fella. George of Jungle.
Need a vine?

687
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:54,526
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
G-Get me out of this stuff, huh?

688
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:03,576
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, don't mention it.

689
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:07,706
King of jungle only here to help!

690
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,881
- George!
- Ursula! Ow!

691
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:39,904
Watch out for that--

692
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,457
- George!
- Ursula!
- What are you doing? Are you okay?

693
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,627
- You just saved that man's life!
- George just lucky, I guess.

694
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:59,382
Ooh. This coffee stuff
really work good.

695
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:04,429
...one of the most daring rescues
ever recorded live on television.

696
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:09,059
This is Valerie Devlin reporting
to you from under the Bay Bridge.
Back to you, Terilyn.

697
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:12,729
You know, they say the city by the bay
is the most romantic in the world...

698
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:15,940
and it looks as though
there might be a little romance
unfolding under the Bay Bridge.

699
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:18,902
- We'll be back in a moment.
- Ohh.

700
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,654
Meanwhile, back in the jungle--

701
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:25,575
There's five stinkin' apes out there.
Which one are we takin' to Vegas?

702
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:29,162
- The one who's playing chess.
- Checkmate.

703
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,544
- Yes!
- Sweet dreams, banana breath.
- Grab him!

704
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,715
Tookie. Go find George.

705
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,010
Tookie-Tookie.

706
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,353
Thor.

707
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,903
Let's get him in the cage
while he's still under. Come on.

708
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:07,409
As the pesky poachers
grunted and groaned...

709
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:10,245
pushing and pulling
the ponderous primate along...

710
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:14,374
the trusty Tookie-Tookie bird
was already winging to the rescue...

711
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:17,043
making a bird-line
for San Francisco...

712
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,547
where George of the Jungle was trying
to give the heiress Ursula...

713
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:22,716
the courage to face her parents...

714
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:26,761
by helping her discover
the juju within.

715
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:30,306
- Make jungle call.
Then you'll feel brave.
- No. I can't.

716
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:33,059
- Come on. Big breath.
Here. Support voice.
- N-No. No, no, no.

717
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,270
- Ursula, please? Pl-- Please?
- No, no!

718
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:39,774
- I can't do it.
- Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.
Come on, Ursula.

719
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:54,706
- Wow.
- Not bad for beginner.

720
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:57,417
- Hi, Ursula.
- Emboldened with jungle juju...
- Hi.

721
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:02,297
Ursula Stanhope went inside
to break the news to her parents,
who took it extremely well.

722
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:06,426
Mother, Daddy,
I love you both very much.

723
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,636
I have something
very important to tell you...

724
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:11,097
and I hope you'll understand.

725
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:16,227
- I don't want to marry Lyle any more.
- We understand, dear.

726
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:21,149
Just kidding.

727
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:29,074
- The young Miss Stanhope
proceeded to spill the beans...
- So, anyway, I went to the jungle--

728
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,076
very quickly...

729
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:41,753
until she got to
the important part at the end.

730
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,676
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle
is in jail and George is with me...

731
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:49,761
and I don't want to marry
Lyle any more.

732
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:53,390
I knew it. It's that swinging man
from the bridge.

733
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:55,392
I saw you smooching on TV.

734
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:58,603
- Mother, we weren't smooching--
- How could you do this to me?

735
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,606
Don't you realize the calibre of people
who are going to be here?

736
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:05,193
- Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say--
- I thought we would be
introducing them...

737
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,406
to Lyle Van de Groot, not some
wild man you found in the jungle.

738
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:12,158
Beatrice, this is supposed to be
her wedding, not yours.

739
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:15,161
- So?
- Beatrice, I know you're upset...

740
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:18,498
and so am l, but we can't force her
to marry someone against her will.

741
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:21,584
- Why not?
- Mom. Dad.

742
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:25,880
I'm ready to go out there
and apologize to everybody
and tell them what really happened.

743
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:27,716
Absolutely not!

744
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:31,803
As far as I'm concerned, you--
you caught one of those viruses.

745
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,431
Yes, one of those dreadful
jungle viruses...

746
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:36,725
that get nice girls all confused.

747
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:41,396
And if Lyle survives that
awful jail, you will simply
have to kiss and make up.

748
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:45,734
As for this evening, we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on.

749
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,196
Now, darling, where is that charming
young friend of yours?

750
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:53,033
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know.
He's around here someplace.

751
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,286
- Well, find him. We haven't got
all day. Oh, Ursula, look!
- Oh, great!

752
00:58:56,453 --> 00:59:01,791
How wonderful!
And look at Richard's exquisite
figurines of you and darling Lyle.

753
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:06,254
George, watch out for that--

754
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,640
Mom. Dad. This is George.

755
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:19,809
Hello, Mr and Mrs Ursula.

756
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:21,644
How do you do?

757
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:39,996
It is always such a pleasure
to see you, Mr Mayor.

758
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:42,665
And, you know, it's so nice
to get away from City Hall...

759
00:59:42,832 --> 00:59:44,876
and be around some normal people
for a change.

760
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:50,382
Well, we are perfectly normal,
I assure you-- in an exceptional way,
of course.

761
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:53,843
Of course.
A-And what about this guy, Lyle?

762
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:57,347
You know, I'd really like to meet
the man you deem good enough
to marry your daughter.

763
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,809
Oh, well, unfortunately Lyle
is busy at the moment...

764
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,019
uh, tending to some legal affairs.

765
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:08,858
- Some pate, Mr Mayor?
- You know, I never touch that stuff.
- Oh.

766
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,861
- I had a lovely time.
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.

767
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:15,699
It's 7:30. Do you know where
your jungle man is?

768
01:00:18,868 --> 01:00:21,538
So this is what you were doing
in the jungle. Clever girl.

769
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:26,209
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk.

770
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:29,379
- I knew it.
- He's not a real meat loaf, is he?

771
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:32,215
No. I mean,
he's not brainy...

772
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,343
in that doctor, lawyer,
banker way...

773
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,929
but he has something else.

774
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:41,808
- He has a--
- Sensual intelligence.

775
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,893
"Sensual intelligence."

776
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:48,023
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

777
01:00:48,189 --> 01:00:50,108
What is it with chicks
and horses, huh?

778
01:01:10,253 --> 01:01:13,256
George, how are you this evening?

779
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:18,219
Pretty sharp threads there,
uh-- George, right?

780
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:20,680
- Yeah. Where're you based?
- The jungle.

781
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:22,932
I hear ya.
We cut our teeth in New York also.

782
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:26,269
Eh, you considering a position
with Stanhope? That could be fruitful.

783
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:29,272
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.
Nobody here have big coconuts.

784
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:37,489
George.

785
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,282
I wa-- Oh.

786
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:42,369
Would you mind
stepping outside with me--

787
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,746
Thank you so much--
for just a moment?

788
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,248
Sure.

789
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,545
- Hello, Beatrice.
- Hello, Ella.

790
01:01:52,712 --> 01:01:54,756
Well, we haven't been friends
for very long, George...

791
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,384
but I already think I know
something about you.

792
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:02,806
- Oh?
- You are in love with my daughter.

793
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:07,519
- Oh, Mrs Ursula not so dumb.
- George.

794
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:12,816
My concern, however, is that Ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings...

795
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:15,527
and that does present
a problem to me.

796
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,323
You see,
you and Ursula together...

797
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,952
would be unbefitting
her social stature.

798
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,081
You see? Let me put it in a way
you might understand.

799
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,667
Where you come from...

800
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:34,421
zebras marry zebras
and leopards marry leopards.

801
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:37,340
Stripes with stripes,
spots with spots.

802
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:41,970
Well, Ursula is a stripe
and you are a spot...

803
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:46,224
one which I intend to have removed
as soon as possible.

804
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:50,061
So you no want Ursula
to love George.

805
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:53,732
I would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast.

806
01:02:53,898 --> 01:02:56,443
- That hurt.
- Not as much as you will
if you do anything...

807
01:02:56,609 --> 01:02:59,320
to screw up my daughter's marriage
to Lyle Van de Groot.

808
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:03,491
When Lyle returns, this wedding
will proceed as planned.

809
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:07,245
If you do anything to upset that...

810
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:11,124
I will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth.

811
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,252
Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?

812
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:18,798
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
I've had quite enough protein for today.

813
01:03:18,965 --> 01:03:21,676
Have a pleasant evening,
Mr Jungle.

814
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,912
Tookie? Tookie!

815
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,750
Tookie.
George so happy to see Tookie.

816
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:02,175
Ape kidnapped?
Ape ape-napped?

817
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:04,678
George save Ape!

818
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,807
Ursula.

819
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:08,450
Well, of course he went back to the
jungle. Where else would go-- the Hague?

820
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:10,660
But why would he leave
without saying goodbye?

821
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:14,706
Well, personally I think he acted
rather sensibly. Showed good character.

822
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:18,168
He understands that he belongs there,
you belong here.

823
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,713
It's really all a question
of stripes and spots.

824
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,924
What? Oh, no.

825
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:27,635
You got to him.
Mother, what did you say?

826
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:30,722
I simply said that if he
really cared for you...

827
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:35,143
he'd leave you alone and let you
get on with your life and marry Lyle.

828
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,979
- I am not marrying Lyle, Mother.
- Beatrice, perhaps we should just--

829
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:41,107
Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,
don't be ridiculous.

830
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:44,944
There's a big difference
between marriageable material
and a fling in the jungle.

831
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:47,989
"A fling in the jungle"?
"A fling in the jungle."

832
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:50,116
Who says I had
a fling in the jungle?

833
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:53,036
You don't think you can
fool your mother, do you?

834
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:56,623
You've been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here.

835
01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:01,878
Now, Ursula, that kind of love
is fleeting. You'll get over it.

836
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:12,263
- Did you just say "love"?
- No.

837
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,307
- You did.
- Ursula.
- You're right.

838
01:06:14,474 --> 01:06:17,143
- Don't say it.
- I love him. I'm outta here.

839
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:21,147
Ursula, you can't love him.
Arthur, say something.

840
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:23,400
- Be careful out there, honey.
- What?

841
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:25,860
- Goodbye, Daddy.
- I love you.

842
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:28,488
- Wha--
- I love you, Mom. Thank you.

843
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:31,658
- Ursula-- Arthur, do something!
- What would you have me do?

844
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:35,078
- There's obviously no stopping her.
- Oh, God.

845
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:43,545
- Ursula!
- God, that woman's a pain in the ass.

846
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:48,258
Meanwhile,
halfway across the world...

847
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,552
another ass was feeling pain...

848
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,388
as an ape named Ape
was caged in a cage...

849
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:56,224
hoping to hear
the jungle king's awesome--

850
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,982
Hey, I'm pretty good at that--

851
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:06,109
and wondering
if he would ever come.

852
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:08,486
But the motion-sick mammal
needn't have moaned...

853
01:07:08,653 --> 01:07:11,489
for that defender of the innocent,
protector of the weak...

854
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:15,035
and all-around good guy
George of the Jungle...

855
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:17,662
was closer than he knew.

856
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,378
Next time George get bigger box.

857
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:28,900
Oh! Bad luck.

858
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:34,072
- Did you hear something?
- What?

859
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,700
- I heard a noise.
- Shut up and push!

860
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:42,247
Oh, I think I chipped a tooth.

861
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:49,796
- Oh, Thor, you're disgusting.
- God, that wasn't me.

862
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:52,716
Not me.

863
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:19,117
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, shut up.

864
01:09:19,284 --> 01:09:21,828
You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,
and I'm gettin' mad enough to--

865
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,247
You know, you really should
work on your anger.

866
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:28,168
Have you tried Brankowski's
"Cage the Rage" technique?

867
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:30,795
Don't let him get to you, Thor.
He's just an ape.

868
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,631
That's a fine way to talk
to your meal ticket.

869
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:36,426
You keep that up, it's liable
to affect my stage performance.

870
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,179
Give him a banana, Thor.
It won't be long now.

871
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:41,389
That's what you said yesterday.

872
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:43,558
This trail's taking us
to the middle of nowhere.

873
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:47,145
The sign at the trail head said
"Short cut to Ape River."

874
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:50,774
Now, why would it say "short cut"
if it wasn't a--

875
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:55,612
Wait a minute.
Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.

876
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:59,032
Very good, Max.
Actually, the trail is a fake.

877
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:04,245
It circles Ape Mountain six times before
heading right back to the tree house.

878
01:10:04,412 --> 01:10:08,500
- Ohh! Oh, I knew we was lost.
- Don't listen to him, Thor.

879
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:11,961
He's just tryin' to trick us,
lead us off the short cut...

880
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:13,880
so we take twice as long
on the regular trail.

881
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:16,257
We're already taking twice as long!

882
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:19,344
Are you gonna let a monkey
make a monkey out of ya?

883
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:22,263
- What?
- Duh!

884
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:27,310
Let's go. If he tells us the short cut
leads to the tree house...

885
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:30,438
then that's exactly
where it doesn't lead.

886
01:10:39,906 --> 01:10:42,242
Ape?

887
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:07,559
- Poor ape-napped brother.
- Careful.

888
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:12,022
Max, look.
We're back at the tree house.

889
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:16,860
Well, I tried, but you fellas
are just too smart for me.

890
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:21,114
- Oh, no!
- "Oh, no" was right,
for the exhausted ape-nappers had--

891
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:25,326
Hey! Why don't you say something
constructive for a change,
like what we should do now.

892
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:29,247
-Because I don't like you.
-Well, I hate you, you snotty son of a--

893
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:33,918
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Having some fun now, hmm?

894
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:36,796
- Thor, were you fighting
with the narrator?
- Well, he started it.

895
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:38,465
- Did not.
- You did too!

896
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:40,342
- Did not.
- You did too!
- Did not!

897
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:42,135
- You did too!
- Thor, stop it!
- Ohh.

898
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,888
That's it. I'm not draggin'
this thing another inch.

899
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:48,391
- What are you doing? Get back there
and work. Where are you going?
- You wretched little weasel.

900
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:51,394
Aren't you the little weasel,
you big brontosaurus?

901
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:59,444
- Let's take care of him.
- Huh? Huh?

902
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:03,448
Whoa!
Why didn't you come sooner?

903
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:06,159
Why Ape have little stars
around head?

904
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:13,166
George, remember
everything I taught you about
Queensberry rules and fighting fair?

905
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,794
- Uh-huh.
- Well, now's a good time to forget it.

906
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,088
Let's finish him off.

907
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:26,721
- Oh, I can't breathe, Max.
- Let it out, Thor. Let it out.

908
01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:36,189
Right, jungle boy.

909
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:53,998
- Huh?
- Huh?

910
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,033
Tookie-Tookie!

911
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,952
- Take this!
- Stop it! Ape!

912
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:51,389
Get it off!
Get it off of me, Max!

913
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:11,034
All right!

914
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:13,745
Shep, look out!

915
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:18,249
Ursula?

916
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,549
George good teacher.

917
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:34,557
George. George.
I came all this way to tell you that--

918
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:37,769
Ursula talk later.
George busy now.

919
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:41,981
- What?
- Fella got toucan on can.

920
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:44,484
I know.

921
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:10,802
Good show, George.
And you too, Tookie.

922
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:14,139
Oh, my hero.

923
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:16,725
Did I just say that?

924
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:21,271
- George. Over here, George!
- Ape, sit tight. George be right back.

925
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:23,106
Oh, I say.

926
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,660
Now George can talk.
What Ursula come back to say?

927
01:15:38,204 --> 01:15:41,916
Only that I know in my heart...

928
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:46,212
that I really, truly--

929
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:49,424
- Haven't seen the light yet.
- Lyle.

930
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:51,593
- Lyle?
- Yes, Lyle.

931
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,721
For the venal Van de Groot had escaped
from the Bujumbura jail...

932
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:58,099
and joined an obscure cult
on the shores of Lake Tanganyika...

933
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,977
which had empowered him with
a peculiar piece of parchment.

934
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:04,898
- What are you doing here?
- Surprised, my little cupcake?

935
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,067
You see, I'm now
an mail-order minister...

936
01:16:07,233 --> 01:16:11,738
ordained the Church of Celestial
Power and Light, Incorporated...

937
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:16,451
capable of performing legally binding
marriage ceremonies anywhere.

938
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:19,537
- Lyle, I'm not marrying you.
- Actually, you are.

939
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:22,123
- Come on, let's go.
Come along, my little African queen.
- George.

940
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:25,877
Now George really mad.
George tear off your--

941
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:31,383
- At ease, jungle boy.
- Everybody freeze now!

942
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:33,802
Operation completed
as ordered, sir.

943
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:38,598
Thank you, Gunnar, Gunter,
Hans, Jan and Phil.

944
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,435
No hard feelings, stone belly.

945
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:44,729
The best man won.
That's all.

946
01:16:44,896 --> 01:16:48,692
I should say, the guy who brought
mercenaries won. That's all.

947
01:16:48,858 --> 01:16:52,362
Okay, honey, you ready to go? I got
a boat waitin' to take us to Bujumbura.

948
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,155
- Come on.
- George!
- Ursula.

949
01:16:54,322 --> 01:16:56,282
- Come on.
- No!
- Don't go that way!

950
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:59,411
- Go that way. No--
- See you later.

951
01:16:59,577 --> 01:17:04,457
- George! Stop it! Stop it!
- Ursula!

952
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:08,670
- Lyle, let go of me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

953
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:40,452
Bongo-gram!
Work every time.

954
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:44,706
Good work, brother apes.
Now listen very carefully to George.

955
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,761
Let 'er rip, Shep.

956
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:04,434
Stop it! Stop it, Lyle!

957
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:08,104
- Come on.
- Let go. Stop it! You're such a jerk!

958
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:14,778
Come on in there!
Come here!

959
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:19,074
You know, I forgive you, and I'm
willing to give you yet another chance.

960
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,744
Lyle, you don't where you're go--

961
01:18:44,557 --> 01:18:47,811
Where's George?

962
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,235
You see? I told you
I'd have a boat waiting.

963
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,473
Okay, then. All righty.

964
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,560
Reverend Lyle
ready to perform the ceremony.

965
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:32,689
Do you, Ursula Stanhope,
take me, Lyle Van de Groot...

966
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:35,984
- to be your lawful wedded husband?
- Get a grip, Lyle.

967
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:46,953
- Lyle.
- Yeah, honey?

968
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,290
- Lyle?
- Oh, my God!

969
01:20:05,513 --> 01:20:08,016
Lyle!

970
01:20:12,228 --> 01:20:14,230
Tookie-Tookie!

971
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:17,317
Thanks, Tookie.

972
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:21,821
This biggest swing
in jungle history.

973
01:20:21,988 --> 01:20:25,367
Will hurt very much,
but George have to do it.

974
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:04,656
- George!
- What the--

975
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:14,416
- This gonna hurt.
- George, watch out for that tree!

976
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:22,674
George not feel so good.

977
01:21:37,897 --> 01:21:42,110
Oh, thank God we've made it.
Say "l do," Ursula.

978
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:46,281
Ah, that's it. We're married.
Now to look at my bride.

979
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:51,661
No!

980
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:59,753
No! No!

981
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:07,218
George, what I came here to say
was that I love you.

982
01:22:08,511 --> 01:22:13,058
- Ursula love George?
- So much.

983
01:22:13,308 --> 01:22:16,561
George love Ursula too.

984
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:21,358
And so George of the Jungle received
the first kiss of his life...

985
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:24,027
that came from
neither elephant nor ape.

986
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:27,989
And on the following new moon...

987
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:32,035
Ursula Stanhope finally got
the simple wedding she had hoped for...

988
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:34,913
as the San Francisco heiress
and the king of the jungle...

989
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,000
joined their hearts forever
in wedded bliss.

990
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,631
- The rings!
- The rings.

991
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:46,800
The rings? Tookie.

992
01:22:50,553 --> 01:22:52,764
Tookie.

993
01:23:10,865 --> 01:23:13,535
Arthur, I wish you'd do something
about all these monkeys.

994
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,079
I feel like Jane Goodall.

995
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:21,459
Madam, I knew Jane Goodall,
and you are no Jane Goodall.

996
01:23:35,056 --> 01:23:37,475
Listenin' to some inner call

997
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:41,730
Swimmin' blindly
to throw myself upon your shore

998
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:44,274
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

999
01:23:46,651 --> 01:23:50,280
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

1000
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:55,410
And I sing, dela, dela

1001
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,665
When I'm with you

1002
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:10,342
I burn for you

1003
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:12,844
I been waiting for you
all my life

1004
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,763
Hoping for a miracle

1005
01:24:14,929 --> 01:24:17,140
I been waiting day and night

1006
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:19,726
Day and night

1007
01:24:19,893 --> 01:24:22,354
I been waiting for you
all my life

1008
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,230
Waiting for redemption

1009
01:24:24,397 --> 01:24:26,316
I been waiting day and night

1010
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:28,818
I burn for you

1011
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:35,408
- I love you.
- Good boy.

1012
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:39,079
And so ends our tale
of that defender of the innocent...

1013
01:24:39,245 --> 01:24:42,499
protector of the weak
and all-around good guy...

1014
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:45,335
George of the Jungle.

1015
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,129
A noble king,
his beautiful queen...

1016
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:50,882
and their nimble young heir
to the jungle throne.

1017
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:53,718
George, watch out for that--

1018
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:57,681
I know what you're thinking--
How does a baby raised by an ape...

1019
01:24:57,847 --> 01:25:01,309
grow up to be king of the jungle,
find his queen...

1020
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:04,062
and live happily ever after?

1021
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:06,356
George just lucky, I guess.

1022
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:10,694
George, George
George of the Jungle

1023
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,946
Strong as he can be

1024
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:17,450
Watch out for that tree

1025
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:19,744
George, George
George of the Jungle

1026
01:25:19,911 --> 01:25:21,913
Lives a life that's free

1027
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:26,584
Wait a moment! Wait, wait, wait! Don't
you want to know what happened to me?

1028
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,810
And now the end is near

1029
01:25:43,977 --> 01:25:47,564
And so I face the final curtain

1030
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,109
My friends
I'll say it clear

1031
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:54,821
I'll state my case
Of which I'm certain

1032
01:25:54,988 --> 01:25:58,158
I've lived a life that's full

1033
01:25:58,324 --> 01:26:01,661
I've travelled
each and every highway

1034
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:05,582
- And more, much more than this
- Whoo

1035
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:09,002
I did it my way
Yes!

1036
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:12,422
There were times
I'm sure you knew

1037
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:16,051
When I bit off
more than I could chew

1038
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:17,719
But through it all

1039
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,387
- When there was doubt
- Doubt

1040
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:23,600
I ate it up and spit it out

1041
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:26,811
I faced it all
and I stood tall

1042
01:26:26,978 --> 01:26:31,191
And did it my way

1043
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:32,734
Doo, doo, doo

1044
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:39,449
George, George
George of the Jungle

1045
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,701
Strong as he can be

1046
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:46,206
Watch out for that tree

1047
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:48,458
George, George
George of the Jungle

1048
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:50,794
Lives a life that's free

1049
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,839
Watch out for that tree

1050
01:26:55,006 --> 01:26:57,133
When he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

1051
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,553
With help from his friend
an ape named Ape

1052
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,889
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

1053
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:05,725
He's man's best friend
He's George's dog

1054
01:27:05,892 --> 01:27:08,687
He's George, George
George of the Jungle

1055
01:27:08,853 --> 01:27:10,939
Strong as he can be

1056
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:15,360
Watch out for that tree

1057
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:17,612
George, George
George of the Jungle

1058
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:19,864
Friend to you and me

1059
01:27:22,325 --> 01:27:24,285
Watch out for that tree

1060
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:26,287
Hear him holler
Swing and sing

1061
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:29,749
All the animals come
to the jungle king

1062
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:32,043
So grab a vine
and swing in time

1063
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,879
If you slam a tree
just pay no mind

1064
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:37,924
Like George, George
George of the Jungle

1065
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:40,093
George, George
George of the Jungle

1066
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,387
George, George
George of the Jungle

1067
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,597
George, George
George of the Jungle

1068
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:46,891
George, George
George of the Jungle

1069
01:27:47,058 --> 01:27:49,102
George, George
George of the Jungle

1070
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:51,354
George, George
George of the Jungle

1071
01:27:51,521 --> 01:27:53,523
George, George
George of the Jungle

1072
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,817
George, George
George of the Jungle

1073
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:58,069
George, George
George of the Jungle

1074
01:27:58,236 --> 01:28:00,196
George, George
George of the Jungle

1075
01:28:00,363 --> 01:28:02,449
George, George
George of the Jungle

1076
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:04,659
George, George
George of the Jungle

1077
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:06,953
Swing from tree to tree

1078
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,499
Watch out for that tree

1079
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,793
George, George
George of the Jungle

1080
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,046
Lives a life that's free

1081
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,467
Watch out for that tree

1082
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:23,094
Left in the wild was a baby
with a smile named George

1083
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:25,847
Who stayed for quite a while

1084
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:28,141
And George grew up
in the trees above

1085
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:31,394
When Ursula found him
they found love

1086
01:28:31,561 --> 01:28:33,772
She took him to the city
Took him straight downtown

1087
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:37,025
But the concrete bliss
brought poor George down

1088
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:39,319
So it's back to the jungle
for a wedding in the green

1089
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:42,530
For the king and queen
of the animal scene

1090
01:28:44,157 --> 01:28:46,159
George, George
George of the Jungle

1091
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:48,411
Strong as he can be

1092
01:28:50,955 --> 01:28:52,999
Watch out for that tree

1093
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:57,003
Watch out for that--
Bang! Ooh! Tree

1094
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:07,681
George, George
George of the Jungle

1095
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:09,557
Watch out for that tree

1096
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:36,788
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the king of the jungle.
