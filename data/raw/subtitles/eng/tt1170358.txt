1
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,775
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

2
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,319
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.

3
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,742
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

4
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,371
- There you are.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,046
Master Stadle.

6
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,578
Mind if I join you?

7
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,538
I'll have the same.

8
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,880
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

9
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,591
Gandalf the Grey.

10
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,843
I know who you are.

11
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,346
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

12
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:13,227
What brings Thorin
Oakenshield to Bree?

13
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,773
I received word that my father...

14
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:21,777
had been seen wandering
the Wilds near Dunland.

15
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,697
I went looking.

16
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,949
I found no sign of him.

17
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,327
Thorin, it's been a long time...

18
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,454
since anything but
rumor was heard...

19
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,580
of Thrain.

20
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,332
He still lives.

21
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,125
I am sure of it.

22
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,506
My father came to see you
before he went missing.

23
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,551
What did you say to him?

24
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,221
I urged him to march
upon Erebor, to rally...

25
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,307
the seven armies of the Dwarves...

26
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,476
to destroy the dragon
and take back...

27
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,353
the Lonely Mountain.

28
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,521
And I would say the same to you.

29
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,775
Take back your homeland.

30
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,782
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

31
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,950
No.

32
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,244
It is not.

33
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,205
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

34
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:18,125
Thorin. That dragon has
sat there long enough.

35
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,418
Sooner or later...

36
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,672
darker minds will
turn towards Erebor.

37
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,675
I ran into some
unsavory characters...

38
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,219
whilst traveling on the Greenway.

39
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,222
They mistook me for a vagabond.

40
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,682
I imagine they regretted that.

41
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,351
One of them was carrying a message.

42
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,146
It is Black Speech.

43
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,068
A promise of payment.

44
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,528
For what?

45
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,406
Your head.

46
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,576
Someone wants you dead.

47
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,039
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

48
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,958
the heir to the Throne of Durin.

49
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,627
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

50
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,004
Together, you have the
might and power...

51
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,173
to retake Erebor.

52
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,676
Summon a meeting of the
seven Dwarf families.

53
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,636
Demand they stand by their oath.

54
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,807
The seven armies swore that oath to
the one who wields the King's Jewel.

55
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,100
The Arkenstone.

56
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,935
It is the only thing that will...

57
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,745
unite them, and in case
you have forgotten...

58
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,231
that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

59
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,155
What if I were to
help you reclaim it?

60
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,949
How?

61
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,244
The Arkenstone lies
half a world away...

62
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,997
buried beneath the feet of
a fire-breathing dragon.

63
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,415
Yes, it does.

64
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,335
Which is why we're going
to need a burglar.

65
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,231
How close is the pack?

66
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:49,026
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

67
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,779
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.

68
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,365
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?

69
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,199
They saw you.

70
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,451
No, that's not it.
What did I tell you?

71
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,994
Quiet as a mouse.

72
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:01,288
Excellent burglar material.

73
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,748
Will you listen? Will you just...

74
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,166
listen?

75
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,460
I'm trying to tell you there
is something else out there.

76
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:11,090
What form did it take?

77
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,800
Like a bear?

78
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,719
Ye... Yes, but bigger.

79
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,054
Much bigger.

80
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,140
You knew about this beast?

81
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,184
I say we double back.

82
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,520
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

83
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,480
There is a house...

84
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:32,194
it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

85
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,696
Whose house?

86
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,156
Are they friend or foe?

87
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,700
Neither.

88
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,661
He will help us or...

89
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,788
he Will kill us.

90
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,291
What choice do we have?

91
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,003
None.

92
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,761
Come on!

93
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,857
This way! Quickly!

94
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:10,733
Run!

95
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,695
Bombur, come on!

96
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,951
To the house!

97
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,579
Run!

98
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,422
Come on, get inside.

99
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,145
Open the door!

100
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,521
Quickly!

101
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,574
- Push!
- Push!

102
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,079
Dwalin!

103
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:05,969
Come on, lads!

104
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,794
What is...

105
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:12,795
that?

106
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,381
That is our host.

107
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,137
His name is Beorn.

108
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,517
And he's a skin-changer.

109
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,145
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

110
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,940
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

111
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,276
The bear is unpredictable...

112
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,736
but the man can be
reasoned with. However...

113
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:41,198
he is not overfond of Dwarves.

114
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,369
He's leaving.

115
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,579
Come away from there.

116
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,291
It's not natural. None of it.

117
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,501
It's obvious. He's under some...

118
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,669
dark spell.

119
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,920
Don't be a fool.

120
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,548
He's under no enchantment
but his own.

121
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,010
All right, now get some sleep.
All of you.

122
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,595
You'll be safe here tonight.

123
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,435
I hope.

124
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,678
So you are the one
they call Oakenshield.

125
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,680
Tell me...

126
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,265
why is Azog...

127
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,475
the Defiler hunting you?

128
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,519
You know of Azog?

129
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,313
How?

130
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:07,566
My people were the first to
live in the mountains...

131
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,528
before the Orcs came
down from the North.

132
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,865
The Defiler killed
most of my family.

133
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,366
But some he...

134
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,701
enslaved.

135
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,871
Not for work, you understand...

136
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,539
but for sport.

137
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,958
Caging skin-changers...

138
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:29,004
and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

139
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,049
There are others like you?

140
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,135
Once there were many.

141
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,928
And now?

142
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,432
Now there is only one.

143
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,186
You need to reach...

144
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:48,106
the mountain before the
last days of autumn.

145
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,483
Before Durin's Day falls.

146
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,692
Yes.

147
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,778
You are running out of time.

148
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,238
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

149
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,283
A darkness lies upon that forest.

150
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,536
Fell things creep
beneath those trees.

151
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,374
There is an alliance between
the Orcs of Moria...

152
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,502
and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

153
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,670
I would not venture there...

154
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,964
except in great need.

155
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,883
We will take the Elven Road.

156
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,218
That path is still safe.

157
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,427
"Safe"?

158
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,221
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

159
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,430
are not like their kin.

160
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,516
They're less wise...

161
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,643
and more dangerous.

162
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,688
But it matters not.

163
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,691
What do you mean?

164
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,693
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

165
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,155
Their numbers are growing.

166
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,865
And you are on foot.

167
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,742
You will never reach...

168
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,036
the forest alive.

169
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,835
I don't like Dwarves.

170
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,504
They're greedy...

171
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,214
and blind.

172
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,592
Blind to the lives of
those they deem...

173
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,303
lesser than their own.

174
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,187
But Orcs I hate more.

175
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,691
What do you need?

176
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,782
<i>Go now. While you have the light.</i>

177
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,618
<i>Your hunters are not far behind.</i>

178
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,978
The Elven Gate.

179
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,481
Here lies our path...

180
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,232
through Mirkwood.

181
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,611
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

182
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,995
Set the ponies loose.

183
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,081
Let them return to their master.

184
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,918
This forest...

185
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,586
feels...

186
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,296
sick.

187
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,965
As if a disease lies upon it.

188
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,094
Is there no way around?

189
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,806
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

190
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,141
Or twice that distance...

191
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,393
south.

192
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,673
<i>Something moves
in the shadows unseen...</i>

193
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,510
<i>hidden from our sight.</i>

194
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,556
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

195
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,142
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

196
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,770
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

197
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,778
<i>If our Enemy has
returned, we must know.</i>

198
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,907
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

199
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,827
The High Fells.

200
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,249
So be it.

201
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,170
Not my horse!

202
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,005
I need it!

203
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,633
You're not leaving us?

204
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,635
I would not do this
unless I had to.

205
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,560
You've changed...

206
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,562
Bilbo Baggins.

207
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,983
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

208
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,446
I was going to tell you.

209
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,200
I...

210
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,164
found something in
the Goblin tunnels.

211
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,749
Found what?

212
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,339
What did you find?

213
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,052
My courage.

214
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,890
Good. Well, that's good.

215
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,561
You'll need it.

216
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,439
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

217
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,815
the slopes of Erebor.

218
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,443
Keep the map and key safe.

219
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,655
Do not enter that
mountain without me.

220
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,830
This is not the Greenwood of old.

221
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:59,376
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

222
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,337
It'll seek to enter your
mind and lead you astray.

223
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,506
"Lead us astray"?

224
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,299
What does that mean?

225
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,803
You must stay on
the path. Do not leave it.

226
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,263
If you do, you'll never...

227
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,807
find it again.

228
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,018
No matter what may come, stay on...

229
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:17,936
the path!

230
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,356
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

231
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,607
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.

232
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,360
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

233
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,747
The path turns this way.

234
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,983
This way.

235
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,745
Air. I need air.

236
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,038
My head, it's swimming!

237
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,373
What's happening?

238
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,041
Keep moving.

239
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,501
Nori...

240
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,879
why have we stopped?

241
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,047
The path...

242
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,965
it's disappeared.

243
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,258
What's going on?

244
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,052
We've lost the path!

245
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,387
Find it.

246
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,682
All of you, look.
Look for the path!

247
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,110
I don't remember this bit.

248
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,987
None of it's familiar.

249
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,989
It's got to be here.

250
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,116
What hour is it?

251
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,870
I do not know. I do not
even know what day it is.

252
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,040
Is there no end
to this accursed forest?!

253
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,847
Attercop.

254
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,709
Look.

255
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,586
A tobacco pouch.

256
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,256
There's Dwarves in these woods.

257
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,133
Dwarves from the Blue
Mountains, no less.

258
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,052
This is exactly the same as mine.

259
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,972
Because it is yours.
Do you understand?

260
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,015
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

261
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,309
We are not lost.
We keep heading east.

262
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,187
But which way is east?
We've lost the sun.

263
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,814
I thought you were the expert.

264
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,941
The sun.

265
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,443
We have to find...

266
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,945
the sun.

267
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,948
Up there.

268
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,032
We need to...

269
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,784
get above the canopy.

270
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,707
What was that?

271
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,794
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

272
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,506
We're being watched.

273
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,681
I can see a lake!

274
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,684
And a river.

275
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,021
And the Lonely Mountain.

276
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,273
We're almost there!

277
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,526
Can you hear me?

278
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,947
I know which way to go!

279
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,409
Hello?

280
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,962
Hello.

281
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:06,975
Oh, no.

282
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,059
Oh, come on.

283
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,911
Kill them! Kill them.

284
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,205
Eat them now, while
their blood is running.

285
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,958
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

286
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:56,834
Stick it again.

287
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,128
Stick it again. Finish it off.

288
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,006
The meat's alive and kicking!

289
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:02,840
Kill him.

290
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:03,841
Kill him now.

291
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,676
Let us feast.

292
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,136
Feast! Feast!

293
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,472
Feast! Feast!

294
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,266
Eat them alive!

295
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,560
Feast!

296
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,777
- What is it?
- What is it?

297
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,864
Eat them alive!

298
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,245
Fat and juicy.

299
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,707
Just a...

300
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,042
little taste.

301
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,055
Curse it! Where is it?!
Where is it?!

302
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,558
Here.

303
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,435
Ah! It stings!

304
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,562
It stings!

305
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,819
Sting.

306
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,071
That's a good name.

307
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,991
Sting.

308
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,094
You all right there, Bofur?

309
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,679
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!

310
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,014
Where's Bilbo?

311
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,223
I'm up here!

312
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,215
Grab the legs!

313
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,383
Pull!

314
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,386
Pull!

315
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,767
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

316
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,644
Where is it?

317
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,541
No!

318
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,460
No! No!

319
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,671
Thorin! Get them!

320
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:47,838
Come on!

321
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,094
Look out, brother!

322
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,514
Fili!

323
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,622
Mine.

324
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,617
Come on...

325
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,035
keep up!

326
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,911
We're clear!

327
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,226
Do not think I won't
kill you, Dwarf.

328
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,145
It would be my pleasure.

329
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,443
- Help!
- Kili!

330
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,629
Throw me a dagger!

331
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,547
Quick!

332
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:54,882
If you think I'm giving you...

333
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,175
a weapon, Dwarf...

334
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,510
you're mistaken!

335
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,017
Search them.

336
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,650
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

337
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,068
Who is this?

338
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,820
- Your brother?
- That is...

339
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,363
my wife!

340
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,699
And what is this horrid creature?

341
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,117
A Goblin-mutant?

342
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,285
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

343
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,527
Where did you get this?

344
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,154
It was given to me.

345
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,994
Not just a thief,
but a liar as well.

346
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,292
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

347
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,982
Unh! This is not the end of it!

348
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,528
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

349
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,321
Get off me!

350
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,704
Aren't you going to search me?

351
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,542
I could have anything
down my trousers.

352
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,961
Or nothing.

353
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,498
Again! Leave it!

354
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,791
There's no way out!

355
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,043
This is no Orc dungeon.

356
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,796
These are the Halls of
the Woodland Realm.

357
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,884
No one leaves here but
by the king's consent.

358
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:33,100
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

359
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,604
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

360
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:38,606
and slay a dragon.

361
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:43,986
I myself suspect a
more prosaic motive.

362
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,530
Attempted burglary.

363
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,533
Or something of that ilk.

364
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:53,454
You have found...

365
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:54,705
a way in.

366
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:55,914
You seek that which would...

367
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:59,168
bestow upon you the right to rule.

368
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,712
The King's Jewel.

369
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,131
The Arkenstone.

370
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,720
It is precious to
you beyond measure.

371
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,431
I understand that.

372
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,019
There are gems in the
mountain that I too desire.

373
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,355
White gems...

374
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,649
of pure starlight.

375
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,943
I offer you my help.

376
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,531
I am listening.

377
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,408
I will let you go...

378
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:35,079
if you but return what is mine.

379
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,583
A favor for a favor.

380
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:40,793
You have my word.

381
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,713
One king to another.

382
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:52,096
I would not trust Thranduil...

383
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,098
the great king...

384
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,516
to honor his word...

385
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,268
should the end of all
days be upon us!

386
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,478
You...

387
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,938
who lack all...

388
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,189
honor!

389
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,317
I have seen how you
treat your friends.

390
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,613
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

391
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,323
seeking your help.

392
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,243
But you turned your back!

393
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:18,163
You turned away from the
suffering of my people...

394
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,374
and the inferno that destroyed us.

395
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,087
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

396
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,130
I know...

397
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,632
its wrath and ruin.

398
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:34,012
I have faced...

399
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,016
the great serpents of the North.

400
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:39,852
I warned your...

401
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:43,397
grandfather of what his
greed would summon.

402
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,859
But he would not listen.

403
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,490
You are just like him.

404
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,703
Stay here if you will...

405
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,496
and rot.

406
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:01,665
A hundred years is a mere blink...

407
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,917
in the life of an Elf.

408
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,836
I'm patient.

409
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,881
I can wait.

410
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,431
Did he offer you a deal?

411
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,849
He did.

412
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,895
I told him he could go
<i>ish kakhfé ai-'dur-rugnu!</i>

413
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,481
Him and all his kin!

414
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,276
Well, that's that, then.

415
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,489
A deal was our only hope.

416
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,660
Not our only hope.

417
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,960
I know you're there.

418
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:51,757
Why do you linger in the shadows?

419
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:55,135
I was coming to report to you.

420
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,681
I thought I ordered that nest to
be destroyed not two moons past.

421
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:00,599
We cleared...

422
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,310
the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

423
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,645
coming up from the South.

424
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:05,521
They are spawning in...

425
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,131
the ruins of Dol Guldur. If we
could kill them at their source...

426
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,484
That fortress lies
beyond our borders.

427
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,529
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

428
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,406
And when we drive
them off, what then?

429
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,242
Will they not spread
to other lands?

430
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,369
Other lands are not my concern.

431
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,413
The fortunes of the world...

432
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:24,748
will rise and fall.

433
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,916
But here in this...

434
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,209
kingdom, we will endure.

435
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,133
Legolas said you fought well today.

436
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,223
He has grown very fond of you.

437
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,894
I assure you, my lord...

438
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,106
Legolas thinks of me as no more
than a captain of the guard.

439
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,191
Perhaps he did once.

440
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,736
Now I am not so sure.

441
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,617
I do not think you would
allow your son...

442
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,328
to pledge himself to
a lowly Silvan Elf.

443
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:06,165
No, you are right. I would not.

444
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,209
Still, he cares about you.

445
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,546
Do not give him hope
where there is none.

446
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:54,004
The stone in your hand, what is it?

447
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,966
It is a talisman.

448
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,804
A powerful spell lies upon it.

449
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:05,766
If any but a Dwarf reads
the runes on this stone...

450
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,851
they will be forever cursed.

451
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:14,858
Or not.

452
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,738
Depending on whether you believe in
that kind of thing. It's just a token.

453
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,992
A rune stone.

454
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,745
My mother...

455
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,914
gave it to me so I'd
remember my promise.

456
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,042
What promise?

457
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,919
That I would come back to her.

458
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,090
She worries.

459
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:41,093
She thinks I'm reckless.

460
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:42,928
Are you?

461
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:45,597
Nah.

462
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,443
Sounds like quite a party...

463
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:00,070
you're having up there.

464
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,739
It is <i>Mereth e-nGilith...</i>

465
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,200
the Feast of Starlight.

466
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,829
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

467
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,874
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

468
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:15,043
I always thought it
is a cold light.

469
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:19,423
Remote and far away.

470
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,509
It is memory...

471
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,429
precious and pure.

472
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,435
Like your promise.

473
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,738
I have walked there sometimes.

474
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:44,656
Beyond the forest...

475
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,450
and up into the night.

476
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:51,038
I have seen the world fall away...

477
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:55,083
and the white light of
forever fill the air.

478
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:00,338
I saw a fire moon once.

479
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,926
It rose over the pass
near Dunland. Huge.

480
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,763
Red and gold, it was.
It filled the sky.

481
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:12,559
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

482
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,937
trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

483
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,482
keeping the mountain to our left.

484
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,442
And then it appeared.

485
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,694
This huge fire moon...

486
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,780
lighting our path.

487
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,324
I wish I could show
you the caverns.

488
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,244
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

489
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,873
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

490
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,167
The bargeman will be
waiting for them.

491
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,502
Say what you like about our...

492
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:42,089
ill-tempered king. He has
excellent taste in wine.

493
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,591
Come, Elros, try it.

494
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,134
I have the Dwarves...

495
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,386
in my charge.

496
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:50,722
They're locked up.
Where can they go? Ha, ha.

497
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,353
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

498
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,313
Must be nearly dawn.

499
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,857
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

500
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,904
Not stuck in here, you're not.

501
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:12,494
Bilbo!

502
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,620
What?

503
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:18,125
Shh! There are guards nearby!

504
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,798
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

505
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,217
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

506
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,521
- Up the stairs.
- You first.

507
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,355
Ori.

508
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,045
Not that way.
Down here. Follow me.

509
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:44,276
Go.

510
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,027
Easy, now.

511
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,210
This way.

512
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,089
Come on.

513
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,924
I don't believe it.
We're in the cellars!

514
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,926
You were supposed to be leading
us out, not further in!

515
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:10,886
I know what I'm doing!

516
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:11,970
Shh!

517
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,097
This way! This way!

518
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:19,728
Everyone...

519
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,230
- climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

520
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,107
- They'll find us.
- No, no.

521
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,400
They won't, I promise you.

522
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:29,154
Please, please. You must trust me.

523
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,117
Do as he says.

524
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,364
Move your big ginger head.

525
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,247
Bifur, get in...

526
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,416
the barrel! Move!

527
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,799
Everyone's in.

528
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,846
What do we do now?

529
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,598
Hold your breath.

530
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,209
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

531
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,044
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

532
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,406
Well done, Master Baggins.

533
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,117
Go! Come on, let's go!

534
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,753
Hold on!

535
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,310
Bilbo!

536
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,149
Hang on!

537
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,069
Help! Ori!

538
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,386
No!

539
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,902
Watch out! There's Orcs!

540
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,718
Get under the bridge!

541
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,144
Kili!

542
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,129
Kili!

543
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:21,803
Kili.

544
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:16,566
Kili!

545
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,943
Nori!

546
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,832
Cut the log!

547
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,799
Bombur!

548
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:41,229
TaurieL

549
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,264
Oh, it's you!

550
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,099
Why am I here, Gandalf?

551
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,559
Trust me, Radagast.

552
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,771
I would not have called you
here without good reason.

553
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:53,861
This is not a nice place to meet.

554
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,238
No.

555
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,657
It is not.

556
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,285
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

557
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:04,247
Old and full of hate.

558
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:05,832
Who's buried here?

559
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:09,544
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

560
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,879
He would have been known only...

561
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,423
as a servant of evil.

562
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,970
One of a number.

563
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,017
One of nine.

564
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,189
Why now, Gandalf?
I don't understand.

565
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:31,023
The Ringwraiths...

566
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:33,067
have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

567
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,278
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

568
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:39,031
A human sorcerer could
not summon such evil.

569
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,242
Who said it was human?

570
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:46,539
The Nine only answer to one master.

571
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:49,375
We've been blind, Radagast.

572
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,711
And in our blindness...

573
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,088
the Enemy has returned.

574
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:58,718
He is summoning his servants.

575
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,095
Azog the Defiler...

576
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:03,347
is no ordinary hunter.

577
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:04,932
He is a commander.

578
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:07,727
A commander of legions.

579
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:12,148
The Enemy is preparing for war.

580
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:14,525
It will begin in the East.

581
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,570
His mind is set upon that mountain.

582
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,655
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

583
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:20,865
Gandalf.

584
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,785
I started this.
I cannot forsake them.

585
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,954
They are in grave danger.

586
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,456
If what you say is true...

587
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:31,417
the world is in grave danger.

588
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:36,130
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

589
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,551
You want me to cast
my friends aside?

590
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:45,890
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.

591
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:54,142
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.

592
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,317
Bombur's half drowned.

593
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,653
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

594
00:58:58,703 --> 00:58:59,820
Come on, let's go!

595
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:01,864
Gloin, help me, my brother.

596
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,077
Come on, lift yourself.

597
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:07,662
Come on!

598
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:10,373
Come on, you big lump, you!

599
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,176
I'm fine. It's nothing.

600
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,344
On your feet.

601
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,638
Kilt's wounded.
His leg needs binding.

602
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:28,266
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

603
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,433
To where?

604
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,602
To the mountain. We're so close.

605
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,064
A lake lies between
us and that mountain.

606
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,608
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

607
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,820
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

608
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,155
We've no weapons to
defend ourselves.

609
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:45,074
Bind his leg, quickly.

610
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,159
You have two minutes.

611
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,389
Do it again...

612
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,266
and you're dead.

613
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,186
Excuse me...

614
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:17,565
but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

615
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,027
That barge over there...

616
01:00:21,077 --> 01:00:24,572
it wouldn't be available
for hire, by any chance?

617
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,325
What makes you think
I would help you?

618
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,411
Those boots have seen better days.

619
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:32,538
As has that coat.

620
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,583
No doubt you have some
hungry mouths to feed.

621
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:38,127
How many bairns?

622
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:40,671
A boy and two girls.

623
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:44,216
And your wife,
I imagine she's a beauty.

624
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,594
Aye.

625
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:48,095
She was.

626
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,850
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

627
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,935
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

628
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,772
What's your hurry?

629
01:00:57,822 --> 01:00:59,231
What's it to you?

630
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:01,150
I would like to know who you are...

631
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,841
and what you are doing
in these lands.

632
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,655
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

633
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,491
journeying to see our kin...

634
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,326
in the Iron Hills.

635
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,662
Simple merchants, you say?

636
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,247
We need food...

637
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,458
supplies, weapons.

638
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:18,876
Can you help us?

639
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,674
I know where these
barrels came from.

640
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,676
What of it?

641
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:30,346
I don't know what business
you had with the Elves...

642
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,598
but I don't think it ended well.

643
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:37,144
No one enters Lake-town
but by leave of the Master.

644
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:40,564
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

645
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,609
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

646
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:46,487
Offer him more.

647
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:52,243
I'll wager there are
ways to enter that town unseen.

648
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,203
Aye.

649
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:56,789
But for that...

650
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,375
you would need a smuggler.

651
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:01,544
For which we would pay double.

652
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:13,722
<i>Such is the nature
of evil. Out there in...</i>

653
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,558
the vast ignorance of the world...

654
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:18,102
it festers and spreads.

655
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,063
A shadow that grows in the dark.

656
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:23,399
A sleepless malice as black...

657
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:26,569
as the oncoming wall of night.

658
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,446
So it ever was.

659
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,241
So will it always be.

660
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:37,204
In time, all foul
things come forth.

661
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,374
You were tracking
a company of 13 Dwarves.

662
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:41,584
Why?

663
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,169
Not 13.

664
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:44,962
Not anymore.

665
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:46,589
The young one...

666
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:49,175
the black-haired archer...

667
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,635
we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

668
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:56,432
The poison's in his blood.
He'll be...

669
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:57,725
choking on it soon.

670
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,311
Answer the question, filth.

671
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:07,443
I would not antagonize her.

672
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,820
You like killing things, Orc?

673
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,531
You like death?

674
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,747
Then let me give it to you.

675
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:32,384
I do not care about one...

676
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:35,304
dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

677
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:38,891
You have nothing to fear.
Tell us...

678
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,644
what you know and I
will set you free.

679
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,605
You had orders to kill them. Why?

680
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:47,024
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

681
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:50,152
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

682
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:51,320
King?

683
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,615
There is no King Under the
Mountain, nor will there ever be.

684
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,159
None would dare enter Erebor...

685
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,410
whilst the dragon lives.

686
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:00,329
You know nothing.

687
01:04:00,379 --> 01:04:03,207
Your world will burn.

688
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,084
What are you talking about?

689
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:06,794
Speak!

690
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:10,047
Our time has come again.

691
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,968
My master serves the One.

692
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:17,888
Do you understand now, Elfling?

693
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,974
Death is upon you.

694
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,434
The flames of war...

695
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:24,311
are upon you.

696
01:04:27,198 --> 01:04:28,440
Why did you do that?

697
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,776
You promised to set him free.

698
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:32,152
And I did.

699
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:36,448
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

700
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,619
There was more
the Orc could tell us.

701
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:43,330
There was nothing more
he could tell me.

702
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,750
What did he mean by
"the flames of war"?

703
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:49,712
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

704
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:52,131
it will destroy all before it.

705
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:56,176
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

706
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:58,178
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

707
01:04:58,229 --> 01:04:59,972
No one enters this kingdom.

708
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,641
And no one leaves it.

709
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:28,685
Watch out!

710
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,406
What are you trying
to do, drown us?

711
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:43,242
I was born and bred on these
waters, Master Dwarf.

712
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,868
If I wanted to drown you...

713
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:46,704
I would not do it here.

714
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:51,208
Oh, I've had enough of
this lippy Lakeman.

715
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,211
I say we throw him over the
side and be done with it.

716
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:56,922
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

717
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,924
Uh, I asked him.

718
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,760
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

719
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,554
We do not have to like him.

720
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:05,431
We simply have to pay him.

721
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,474
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

722
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,684
your pockets.

723
01:07:09,735 --> 01:07:11,520
How do we know he won't betray us?

724
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,980
We don't.

725
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:14,523
There's...

726
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,024
just a wee problem.

727
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,694
We're 10 coins short.

728
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:21,530
Gloin.

729
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:23,741
Come on.

730
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,118
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

731
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,538
I have been bled dry...

732
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:30,873
by this venture.

733
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:32,166
What have I seen...

734
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,709
for my investment?

735
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:36,295
Naught but misery and...

736
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:37,421
grief and...

737
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,764
Bless my beard.

738
01:07:48,399 --> 01:07:49,767
Take it.

739
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:52,269
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

740
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,232
The money, quick. Give it to me.

741
01:07:57,283 --> 01:08:00,152
We will pay you when we get
our provisions but not before.

742
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:02,863
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

743
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,573
There are guards ahead.

744
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,510
What's he doing?

745
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,053
He's talking to someone.

746
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:29,807
He's pointing right at us.

747
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:33,769
Now they're...

748
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:34,603
shaking hands.

749
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:36,313
- What?
- The villain.

750
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,856
He's selling us out.

751
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:01,797
Quiet.

752
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,301
We're approaching the tollgate.

753
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:18,522
Halt!

754
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:20,148
Goods inspection!

755
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,734
Papers, please!

756
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,736
Oh, it's you, Bard.

757
01:09:24,787 --> 01:09:26,029
Morning, Percy.

758
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,489
Anything to declare?

759
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:30,492
Nothing, but that I
am cold and tired...

760
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,785
and ready for home.

761
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,287
You and me both.

762
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,792
There we are.

763
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:39,877
All in order.

764
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:42,963
Not so fast.

765
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:47,426
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."

766
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:49,636
Only...

767
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:53,432
they're not empty...

768
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,475
are they, Bard?

769
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:56,685
If I recall correctly...

770
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:59,229
you're licensed as a bargeman.

771
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:01,106
Not...

772
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:03,859
a fisherman.

773
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,611
That's none of your business.

774
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,279
Wrong.

775
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:10,949
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

776
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:13,744
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

777
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:16,246
These fish are illegal.

778
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,623
Empty the barrels...

779
01:10:17,673 --> 01:10:20,083
- ...over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

780
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:24,129
Come on. Get a move on.

781
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,173
Folk in this town are struggling.

782
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:27,924
Times are hard.

783
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:29,134
Food is scarce.

784
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:30,510
That's not my problem.

785
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:34,640
And when the people hear the Master
is dumping fish back in the lake...

786
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:36,767
when the rioting starts...

787
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:40,937
will it be your problem then?

788
01:10:45,743 --> 01:10:47,027
Stop.

789
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,531
Ever the people's champion...

790
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:53,867
eh, Bard? Protector of...

791
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:54,910
the common folk.

792
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,640
You might have their
favor now, bargeman...

793
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,829
but it won't last.

794
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:03,168
Raise the gate!

795
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,173
The Master has his eye on you.

796
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:09,925
You'd do well to remember:

797
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,718
We know where you live.

798
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:13,637
It's a small town, Alfrid.

799
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,390
Everyone knows where
everyone lives.

800
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,866
All this talk of civil unrest.

801
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:36,785
Someone's been stirring
the pot, sire.

802
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,415
Gout playing up, sire?

803
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:42,624
It's the damp.

804
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:44,074
It's the only possible explanation.

805
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,711
Get me a brandy.

806
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,381
The mood of the people,
sire, it's turning ugly.

807
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:52,592
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

808
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:54,386
It's not my fault they
live in a place...

809
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:57,347
that stinks of fish oil and tar.

810
01:11:57,856 --> 01:12:01,017
Jobs, shelter, food.

811
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:02,894
It's all they ever bleat about.

812
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:06,773
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

813
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,484
<i>Then we must find these...</i>

814
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,653
troublemakers and arrest them.

815
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,822
My thoughts exactly, sire.

816
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:16,908
And all this talk of
change must be suppressed.

817
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,453
Can't afford to let the
rabble band together...

818
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:21,371
and start making noises.
The next thing...

819
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,541
you know, they'll start
asking questions...

820
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,376
forming committees...

821
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,795
launching inquiries.

822
01:12:28,846 --> 01:12:31,506
Out with the old, in with the new?

823
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,175
What?

824
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:35,469
That's what they've
been saying, sire.

825
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:36,678
There is even talk...

826
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,138
of an election.

827
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,598
An election? Heh.

828
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,141
That's absurd.

829
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,393
I won't stand for it. Ha!

830
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:46,438
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, sire.

831
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,858
Shirkers.

832
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,026
Ingrates.

833
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,319
Rabble-rousers.

834
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,280
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

835
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,199
Who would dare?

836
01:12:57,249 --> 01:12:58,450
Who...?

837
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,706
Bard.

838
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,125
You mark my words:

839
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:09,002
<i>That trouble-making bargeman...</i>

840
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,004
<i>is behind all this.</i>

841
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,221
Get your hands off me.

842
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:28,408
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

843
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,858
The fish you can have for nothing.

844
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,987
Follow me.

845
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:46,122
Da!

846
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,416
Our house, it's being watched.

847
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,038
You can tell the
Master I'm done for the day.

848
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,876
Da! Where have you been?

849
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:34,087
Father! There you are!
I was worried.

850
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,839
Here, Sigrid.

851
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:37,382
Bain, get them in.

852
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,726
If you speak of this to anyone...

853
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,436
I'll rip your arms off.

854
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:53,773
Get off.

855
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,318
Up there.

856
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:04,868
Da...

857
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,370
why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

858
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:08,955
Will they bring us luck?

859
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:16,379
They may not be the best fit
but they'll keep you warm.

860
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:18,089
Thank you very much.

861
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:30,393
A Dwarvish windlance.

862
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,812
You look like you've seen a ghost.

863
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:34,731
He has.

864
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,524
The last time we saw...

865
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,443
such a weapon...

866
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:40,362
a city was on fire.

867
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,658
It was the day the dragon came.

868
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,371
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

869
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,747
<i>destroyed Dale.</i>

870
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:55,418
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

871
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:56,429
<i>rallied his bowmen...</i>

872
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:57,796
<i>to fire upon the beast.</i>

873
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:00,674
But a dragon's hide is tough.

874
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,426
Tougher than the strongest armor.

875
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:06,846
Only a Black Arrow fired
from a windlance...

876
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:08,682
could have pierced
the dragon's hide.

877
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:10,684
<i>And few of those...</i>

878
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:12,727
<i>arrows were ever made.</i>

879
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:19,192
<i>The store was running low...</i>

880
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:20,277
<i>when Girion...</i>

881
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,248
<i>made his last stand.</i>

882
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:32,914
Had the aim of Men
been true that day...

883
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:35,333
much would have been different.

884
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,381
You speak as if you were there.

885
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,843
All Dwarves know the tale.

886
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:47,387
Then you would know that
Girion hit the dragon.

887
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,514
He loosened a scale
under the left wing.

888
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:51,484
One more shot and he would
have killed the beast.

889
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:54,853
That's a fairy story, lad.

890
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,479
Nothing more.

891
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,857
You took our money.

892
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,234
Where are the weapons?

893
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,030
Wait here.

894
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,463
Tomorrow begins
the last days of autumn.

895
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:23,965
Durin's Day falls the
morn after next.

896
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:26,134
We must reach the
mountain before then.

897
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:27,719
And if we do not?

898
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:30,305
If we fail to find the hidden
door before that time?

899
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:31,848
Then this quest has
been for nothing.

900
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,570
What is this?

901
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:47,405
Pike hook.

902
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:48,823
Made from an old harpoon.

903
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:51,576
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

904
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:53,370
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

905
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,121
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

906
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,124
but in defense of your life, these
will serve you better than none.

907
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,125
We paid...

908
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,086
you for weapons.

909
01:18:01,136 --> 01:18:02,879
Iron-forged swords...

910
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:04,130
and axes!

911
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:05,340
It's a joke!

912
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:10,011
You won't find better
outside the city armory.

913
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,098
All iron-forged weapons are
held there under lock and key.

914
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:14,390
Thorin...

915
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:15,725
why not take what's...

916
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:16,893
on offer and go?

917
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,353
I've made do with less.

918
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,396
So have you.

919
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,900
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

920
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,068
What did you say?

921
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,598
There are spies
watching this house...

922
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,489
and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

923
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:30,740
You must wait...

924
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,908
till nightfall.

925
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:49,551
Thorin.

926
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,690
Da?

927
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:08,319
Don't let them leave.

928
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,477
Tauriel...

929
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,314
you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

930
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:45,440
on your own.

931
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,567
But I'm not on my own.

932
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,694
You knew I would come.

933
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:53,156
The king is angry...

934
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,200
Tauriel. For 600 years...

935
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,160
my father has protected
you, favored you.

936
01:19:58,086 --> 01:19:59,662
You defied his orders.

937
01:19:59,713 --> 01:20:01,289
You betrayed his trust.

938
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:14,052
The king has never
let Orc filth roam our lands.

939
01:20:14,102 --> 01:20:17,597
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

940
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,140
It is not our fight.

941
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,892
It is our fight.

942
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,144
It will not end here.

943
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:26,272
With every victory,
this evil will grow.

944
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,275
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

945
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,611
We will hide within our walls...

946
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:34,197
live our lives away
from the light...

947
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:35,990
and let darkness descend.

948
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,744
Are we not part of this world?

949
01:20:40,754 --> 01:20:42,121
Tell me, <i>mellon.</i>

950
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:45,875
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

951
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:53,466
Hello, Bard. What you after?

952
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:56,052
There was a tapestry!

953
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,888
An old one! Where's it gone?

954
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:00,218
What tapestry you talking about?

955
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:01,266
This one.

956
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:03,851
They were Dwarves,
I tell you. Appeared...

957
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:04,936
out of nowhere.

958
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,355
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

959
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,232
I've never seen the like.

960
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,568
What are Dwarves doing
in these parts?

961
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:13,278
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

962
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,446
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

963
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,291
Prophecy.

964
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:31,129
Prophecy.

965
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:32,672
The old tales will come true.

966
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:35,174
Vast halls of treasure!

967
01:21:35,225 --> 01:21:36,593
Can it really be true?

968
01:21:36,643 --> 01:21:39,554
Has the lord of silver
fountains returned?

969
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:42,432
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

970
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,934
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

971
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,771
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

972
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:51,899
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

973
01:21:53,034 --> 01:21:55,111
<i>And the bell shall ring in gladness</i>

974
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:55,945
<i>At the Mountain</i>

975
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:57,697
<i>King's return</i>

976
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:00,658
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

977
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,995
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

978
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:07,957
Da, I tried to stop them.

979
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,625
How long have they been gone?

980
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:15,423
- Can you see anything?
- Shh! Keep it down.

981
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:18,635
As soon as we have the weapons,
we make straight for the mountain.

982
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:20,053
Go, go!

983
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,637
Go, Nori.

984
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:25,767
Next.

985
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:40,239
You all right?

986
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,783
I can manage.

987
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,118
Let's just get out of here.

988
01:22:57,932 --> 01:22:59,008
Run!

989
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,385
Quickly! Move now!

990
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:15,733
Get off me! Get off!

991
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:17,568
Move them along here.

992
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,695
Move on!

993
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:29,789
What is the meaning of this?

994
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:33,126
- We caught them stealing weapons, sire.
- Ah.

995
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:35,670
Enemies of the state, eh?

996
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,713
A desperate bunch of...

997
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:39,132
mercenaries, if ever
there was, sire.

998
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:40,591
Hold your tongue!

999
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:45,304
You do not know to whom you speak.

1000
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,765
This is no common criminal.

1001
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,392
This is Thorin...

1002
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:52,770
son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1003
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,025
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1004
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:03,906
We have come to
reclaim our homeland.

1005
01:24:08,419 --> 01:24:11,622
I remember this town in
the great days of old.

1006
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,959
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1007
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,627
filled with silks and fine gems.

1008
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:20,214
This was no forsaken
town on a lake.

1009
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:23,926
This was the center of
all trade in the North!

1010
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,345
I would...

1011
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:27,805
see those days return.

1012
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:30,558
I would relight the great
forges of the Dwarves...

1013
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:31,768
and send wealth and riches...

1014
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:34,479
flowing once more from
the Halls of Erebor!

1015
01:24:37,282 --> 01:24:38,065
Death!

1016
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:40,276
That is what you will...

1017
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,819
bring upon us!

1018
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:44,363
Dragon fire and ruin.

1019
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,743
If you waken that beast...

1020
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,953
it will destroy us all.

1021
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:53,039
You can listen to this naysayer...

1022
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,916
but I promise you this:

1023
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:58,753
If we succeed...

1024
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,632
all will share in the
wealth of the mountain.

1025
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:10,097
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

1026
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,557
10 times over!

1027
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:14,769
All of you!

1028
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,229
Listen to me!

1029
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:17,522
You must listen!

1030
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:19,482
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

1031
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,235
Have you forgotten those...

1032
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,529
who died in the firestorm?!

1033
01:25:26,623 --> 01:25:27,740
And for what purpose?

1034
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:31,035
The blind ambition of
a Mountain King...

1035
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:33,913
so riven by greed, he could not...

1036
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:35,665
see beyond his own desire!

1037
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,543
Now, now!

1038
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:40,795
We must not, any of us...

1039
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:43,422
be too quick to lay blame.

1040
01:25:44,349 --> 01:25:45,132
Let us...

1041
01:25:45,183 --> 01:25:47,093
not forget that it was...

1042
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,136
Girion, Lord of Dale...

1043
01:25:49,187 --> 01:25:51,055
your ancestor...

1044
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:53,808
who failed to kill the beast!

1045
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:58,312
It's true, sire.

1046
01:25:58,363 --> 01:25:59,772
We all know the story.

1047
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:03,025
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1048
01:26:03,076 --> 01:26:05,862
Each one missing its mark.

1049
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,870
You have no right.

1050
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,498
No right to enter that mountain.

1051
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:21,335
I have the only right.

1052
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:29,051
I speak to the Master...

1053
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:30,761
of the Men of the Lake.

1054
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:33,306
Will you see the
prophecy fulfilled?

1055
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:35,224
Will you...

1056
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,353
share in the great
wealth of our people?

1057
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,818
What say you?

1058
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:52,742
I say unto you...

1059
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:54,994
Welcome!

1060
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:56,203
Welcome!

1061
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:57,538
And thrice...

1062
01:26:57,588 --> 01:26:58,789
welcome...

1063
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,666
King Under the Mountain!

1064
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:15,264
You do know we're
one short. Where's Bofur?

1065
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:18,142
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1066
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:22,146
If we're to find the door before
nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1067
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:27,318
Not you.

1068
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:30,363
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1069
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:33,449
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1070
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:34,617
Not now.

1071
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:41,999
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1072
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:44,335
When we first look upon the
Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1073
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:46,837
Kili, stay here.

1074
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:48,589
Rest.

1075
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,841
Join us when you're healed.

1076
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,765
I'll stay with the lad.

1077
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,809
My duty lies with the wounded.

1078
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:01,018
Uncle.

1079
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,604
We grew up on tales
of the mountain.

1080
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,106
Tales you told us.

1081
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:06,277
You cannot take that away...

1082
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:07,525
from him!
- Fili.

1083
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:08,818
I will carry him if I must!

1084
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:11,487
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1085
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:15,533
I cannot risk the fate of this
quest for the sake of one Dwarf.

1086
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,619
Not even my own kin.

1087
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:23,124
Fili, don't be a fool.

1088
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:25,126
You belong with the company.

1089
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:27,003
I belong with my brother.

1090
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:42,351
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1091
01:28:43,236 --> 01:28:46,480
Go now with our goodwill...

1092
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,107
and good wishes.

1093
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:52,236
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!

1094
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,612
to all!

1095
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:59,076
Good bye.

1096
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:06,167
Out of the way!

1097
01:29:06,217 --> 01:29:07,752
No! No!

1098
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:16,385
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1099
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,220
Kili? Kili!

1100
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:22,975
No.

1101
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,852
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1102
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:25,686
No, no...

1103
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:26,729
no! Please!

1104
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:29,523
No one will help us. Kilt's sick.

1105
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:33,235
He's very sick.

1106
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,194
What is this place?

1107
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:16,737
It was once the city of Dale.

1108
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,407
Now it is a ruin.

1109
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,369
The desolation of Smaug.

1110
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:25,538
The sun will soon reach midday.

1111
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:28,040
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1112
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,125
This way.

1113
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:31,418
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1114
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,087
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1115
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:34,978
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?

1116
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:36,298
We have no time...

1117
01:30:36,349 --> 01:30:37,925
to wait upon the Wizard.

1118
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:39,969
We're on our own. Come!

1119
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,863
Dol Guldur.

1120
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:01,282
The Hill of Sorcery.

1121
01:31:01,332 --> 01:31:03,784
It looks completely abandoned.

1122
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:05,494
As it is meant to.

1123
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,955
A spell of concealment...

1124
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:11,292
lies over this place,
which means...

1125
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:14,628
our Enemy is not yet
ready to reveal himself.

1126
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:19,925
He has not regained
his full strength.

1127
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:23,721
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1128
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:26,181
Tell her we must force his hand.

1129
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:27,474
What do you mean?

1130
01:31:27,525 --> 01:31:29,310
I'm going in alone.

1131
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:32,062
On no account come after me.

1132
01:31:37,994 --> 01:31:39,486
Do I have your word?

1133
01:31:39,537 --> 01:31:41,739
Yes, yes, yes!

1134
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:54,919
Wait, Gandalf!

1135
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,005
What if it's a trap?!

1136
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,843
Turn around and do not come back.

1137
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:10,559
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1138
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,226
Anything?

1139
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:35,978
Nothing!

1140
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:41,108
If the map is true...

1141
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,403
then the hidden door
lies directly above us.

1142
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,576
Up here!

1143
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:01,420
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.

1144
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:34,369
This must be it.

1145
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,082
The hidden door.

1146
01:34:42,136 --> 01:34:44,088
Let all those who doubted us...

1147
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:46,590
rue this day!

1148
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:54,765
Right, then. We have a key.

1149
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:57,976
Which means that somewhere...

1150
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:00,479
there is a key-hole.

1151
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:04,066
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1152
01:35:05,868 --> 01:35:06,902
will shine upon...

1153
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:08,570
the key-hole."

1154
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,789
Nori.

1155
01:35:25,221 --> 01:35:27,381
We're losing the light. Come on.

1156
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:36,473
Be quiet! I can't
hear when you're thumping.

1157
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:37,516
I can't find it.

1158
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:40,310
It's not here!

1159
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:41,645
It's not here!

1160
01:35:43,197 --> 01:35:44,558
- Break it down!
- Aye.

1161
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:47,276
Come on!

1162
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:50,195
Break!

1163
01:35:50,246 --> 01:35:51,447
It has to break.

1164
01:35:52,206 --> 01:35:53,740
It's no good.

1165
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:56,493
The door's sealed.
Can't be opened by force.

1166
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,246
There's a powerful magic on it.

1167
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:10,007
No!

1168
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,639
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1169
01:36:19,316 --> 01:36:21,101
will shine upon the key-hole."

1170
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:27,107
That is what it says.

1171
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:33,030
What did we miss?

1172
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,452
What did we miss?

1173
01:36:39,295 --> 01:36:40,454
Balin?

1174
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:42,789
We've lost the light.

1175
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:47,169
There's no more to be done.

1176
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:49,296
We had but...

1177
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:50,797
one chance.

1178
01:36:53,017 --> 01:36:54,468
Come away, lads.

1179
01:36:54,518 --> 01:36:56,512
It's over.

1180
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:59,723
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

1181
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:03,644
Where are they going?

1182
01:37:05,237 --> 01:37:07,314
You can't give up now!

1183
01:37:22,046 --> 01:37:23,413
Thorin.

1184
01:37:25,257 --> 01:37:27,125
You can't give up now.

1185
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,056
"Stand by the gray stone...

1186
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:45,018
when the thrush knocks."

1187
01:37:45,569 --> 01:37:47,145
The setting sun.

1188
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:51,066
And "the last light of
Durin's Day will shine..."

1189
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,027
The last light.

1190
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,948
Last light.

1191
01:38:34,451 --> 01:38:35,902
The last light!

1192
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,247
The key-hole!

1193
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:48,332
Come back!

1194
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:50,459
Come back!

1195
01:38:50,509 --> 01:38:52,878
It's the light of the moon!
The last...

1196
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:56,214
moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

1197
01:38:57,933 --> 01:39:00,510
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?

1198
01:39:00,561 --> 01:39:02,471
It was here.

1199
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:04,514
Come on, it was... It was here.

1200
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,058
It was just...

1201
01:40:03,874 --> 01:40:05,534
Erebor.

1202
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:07,369
Thorin.

1203
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:22,634
I know these walls.

1204
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:27,931
These halls.

1205
01:40:30,734 --> 01:40:32,310
This stone.

1206
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:36,857
You remember it...

1207
01:40:36,907 --> 01:40:38,233
Balin.

1208
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:44,364
Chambers filled with golden light.

1209
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,742
I remember.

1210
01:41:00,806 --> 01:41:02,340
"Herein lies...

1211
01:41:02,391 --> 01:41:04,468
the Seventh Kingdom of...

1212
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:05,886
Durin's Folk.

1213
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:10,932
May the Heart of the
Mountain unite all...

1214
01:41:10,983 --> 01:41:14,769
Dwarves in defense of this home."

1215
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,315
The Throne of the King.

1216
01:41:18,782 --> 01:41:20,317
Ah.

1217
01:41:21,827 --> 01:41:25,363
And what's that above it?

1218
01:41:28,709 --> 01:41:30,660
The Arkenstone.

1219
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:33,371
Arkenstone.

1220
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:38,627
And what's that?

1221
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,922
That, Master Burglar...

1222
01:41:42,764 --> 01:41:45,008
is why you are here.

1223
01:42:03,702 --> 01:42:05,612
Can you not do something?

1224
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:08,073
I need herbs. Something
to bring down his fever.

1225
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:10,700
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1226
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:13,745
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1227
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,997
No, it's a weed.
We feed it to the pigs.

1228
01:42:16,256 --> 01:42:17,582
Pigs?

1229
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:18,959
Weed.

1230
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:20,835
Right.

1231
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:22,963
Don't move.

1232
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:29,302
You want me to find a jewel?

1233
01:42:30,646 --> 01:42:32,556
A large, white jewel.

1234
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:34,140
Yes.

1235
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:38,103
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1236
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:41,648
There is only one Arkenstone...

1237
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:44,484
and you'll know it when you see it.

1238
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:46,736
Right.

1239
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:51,074
In truth...

1240
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:52,200
lad...

1241
01:42:52,793 --> 01:42:55,036
I do not know...

1242
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:57,372
what you will find down there.

1243
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:02,627
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1244
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:03,837
No, Balin.

1245
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:07,132
I promised I would do this...

1246
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:09,509
and I think I must try.

1247
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:15,932
It never ceases to amaze me.

1248
01:43:15,982 --> 01:43:16,975
What's that?

1249
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:18,935
The courage of Hobbits.

1250
01:43:21,113 --> 01:43:22,564
Go now...

1251
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:27,068
with as much luck
as you can muster.

1252
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:35,577
Oh, Bilbo?

1253
01:43:37,796 --> 01:43:40,290
If there is, in fact...

1254
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:42,626
a live dragon...

1255
01:43:42,676 --> 01:43:43,918
down there...

1256
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:48,381
don't waken it.

1257
01:45:05,759 --> 01:45:07,439
Where is your master?

1258
01:45:09,012 --> 01:45:10,296
Where is he?!

1259
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:26,558
Sauron!

1260
01:47:49,047 --> 01:47:50,331
Hello?

1261
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,768
He's not at home.

1262
01:48:11,528 --> 01:48:13,396
Not at home. Ahem.

1263
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:15,315
Good.

1264
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:18,860
Good, good, good.

1265
01:49:12,839 --> 01:49:13,623
What's that?

1266
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,671
Shush.Shush.

1267
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:22,298
Arkenstone.

1268
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:24,717
Arkenstone.

1269
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:27,595
A large, white jewel.

1270
01:49:29,606 --> 01:49:31,182
Very helpful.

1271
01:51:56,586 --> 01:51:58,162
Well...

1272
01:51:59,631 --> 01:52:01,124
thief.

1273
01:52:02,926 --> 01:52:06,754
I smell you.

1274
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:10,341
I hear your breath.

1275
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:13,261
I feel...

1276
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:14,429
your air.

1277
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:20,893
Where are you?

1278
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:23,438
Where are you?

1279
01:52:43,383 --> 01:52:44,584
Come, now...

1280
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:47,461
don't be shy.

1281
01:52:47,512 --> 01:52:49,922
Step into the light.

1282
01:52:53,935 --> 01:52:54,719
Hmm.

1283
01:52:56,646 --> 01:53:00,057
There is something about you.

1284
01:53:03,236 --> 01:53:04,228
Something you...

1285
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:05,313
carry.

1286
01:53:06,281 --> 01:53:09,358
Something made of gold.

1287
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:13,029
But far more...

1288
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:15,072
precious.

1289
01:53:15,123 --> 01:53:17,658
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1290
01:53:20,253 --> 01:53:21,621
There you are...

1291
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:23,414
Thief in the...

1292
01:53:23,464 --> 01:53:25,499
Shadows.

1293
01:53:27,135 --> 01:53:29,921
I did not come to steal from you...

1294
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:30,963
O Smaug...

1295
01:53:31,014 --> 01:53:34,467
the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

1296
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:36,344
to gaze upon your magnificence.

1297
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:37,511
To see...

1298
01:53:37,562 --> 01:53:40,723
if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

1299
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:43,184
I did not believe them.

1300
01:53:51,826 --> 01:53:55,947
And do you now?!

1301
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,533
Truly...

1302
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:02,036
the tales and songs...

1303
01:54:02,962 --> 01:54:05,873
fall utterly short
of your enormity...

1304
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:09,085
O Smaug the Stupendous.

1305
01:54:09,135 --> 01:54:12,213
Do you think flattery
will keep you alive?

1306
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:13,673
No, no.

1307
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:15,424
No, indeed.

1308
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:20,930
You seem familiar with my name...

1309
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:24,058
but I don't remember
smelling your kind before.

1310
01:54:24,984 --> 01:54:26,769
Who are you...

1311
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:29,522
and where do you come from...

1312
01:54:29,572 --> 01:54:32,108
may I ask?

1313
01:54:41,459 --> 01:54:43,327
I come from under the hill.

1314
01:54:43,503 --> 01:54:45,079
Underhill?

1315
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:49,667
And under hills...

1316
01:54:49,717 --> 01:54:51,919
and over hills my path has led.

1317
01:54:52,595 --> 01:54:53,629
And... And...

1318
01:54:54,222 --> 01:54:56,757
through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1319
01:54:56,808 --> 01:54:58,718
Impressive.

1320
01:54:58,768 --> 01:55:01,012
What else do you claim to be?

1321
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:02,763
I am...

1322
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,476
Luck-wearer.

1323
01:55:08,736 --> 01:55:10,104
Riddle-maker.

1324
01:55:10,154 --> 01:55:12,023
Lovely titles.

1325
01:55:12,532 --> 01:55:13,899
Go on.

1326
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:15,234
Barrel-rider.

1327
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:18,904
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1328
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:21,073
And what about...

1329
01:55:21,124 --> 01:55:24,285
your little Dwarf friends?

1330
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,662
Where are they hiding?

1331
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:31,083
Dwarves?

1332
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:33,002
No.

1333
01:55:33,469 --> 01:55:35,212
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1334
01:55:35,263 --> 01:55:36,547
You've got that all wrong.

1335
01:55:36,597 --> 01:55:40,551
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1336
01:55:40,935 --> 01:55:42,386
They sent you in here...

1337
01:55:42,437 --> 01:55:44,597
to do their dirty
work while they...

1338
01:55:44,647 --> 01:55:46,807
skulk about outside.

1339
01:55:47,859 --> 01:55:49,226
Truly...

1340
01:55:49,819 --> 01:55:51,187
you are mistaken...

1341
01:55:51,237 --> 01:55:54,440
O Smaug, Chiefest and
Greatest of Calamities.

1342
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:58,069
You have nice manners...

1343
01:55:58,119 --> 01:56:00,279
for a thief and...

1344
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:01,447
a liar!

1345
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:06,202
I know the smell and
taste of Dwarf.

1346
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:07,828
No one better!

1347
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:10,956
It is the gold!

1348
01:56:11,007 --> 01:56:11,957
They are drawn...

1349
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:13,250
to treasure like...

1350
01:56:13,301 --> 01:56:15,044
flies to dead flesh.

1351
01:56:18,389 --> 01:56:19,799
Did you think I did not know...

1352
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:21,759
this day would come?!

1353
01:56:23,436 --> 01:56:24,929
That a pack of...

1354
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:26,472
canting Dwarves...

1355
01:56:26,522 --> 01:56:29,058
would come crawling back...

1356
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,851
to the mountain?!

1357
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:36,607
Was that an earthquake?

1358
01:56:36,657 --> 01:56:38,984
That, my lad...

1359
01:56:41,996 --> 01:56:43,656
was a dragon.

1360
01:56:51,756 --> 01:56:52,540
Da?

1361
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,667
It's coming from the mountain.

1362
01:56:58,512 --> 01:56:59,964
You should leave us.

1363
01:57:00,056 --> 01:57:00,881
Take your children.

1364
01:57:00,932 --> 01:57:02,007
Get out of here.

1365
01:57:02,475 --> 01:57:03,968
And go where?

1366
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:06,429
There is nowhere to go.

1367
01:57:08,189 --> 01:57:09,932
Are we going to die, Da?

1368
01:57:11,776 --> 01:57:13,144
No, darling.

1369
01:57:13,194 --> 01:57:13,978
The dragon.

1370
01:57:14,028 --> 01:57:15,688
It's going to kill us.

1371
01:57:26,165 --> 01:57:28,159
Not if I kill it first.

1372
01:57:29,418 --> 01:57:33,289
The King Under the
Mountain is dead.

1373
01:57:33,339 --> 01:57:35,207
I took his throne.

1374
01:57:35,383 --> 01:57:36,500
I ate his...

1375
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:39,545
people like a wolf among sheep.

1376
01:57:43,099 --> 01:57:44,467
I kill where...

1377
01:57:44,517 --> 01:57:46,343
I wish, when...

1378
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:48,053
I Wish.

1379
01:57:48,104 --> 01:57:51,599
My armor is iron.

1380
01:58:00,575 --> 01:58:03,194
No blade can pierce me.

1381
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:07,615
All right.

1382
01:58:07,665 --> 01:58:10,201
A Black Arrow?
Why did you never tell me?

1383
01:58:10,251 --> 01:58:12,077
Because you did not need to know.

1384
01:58:19,468 --> 01:58:21,212
Listen to me carefully.

1385
01:58:21,387 --> 01:58:23,714
I need you to distract the guards.

1386
01:58:24,098 --> 01:58:27,426
Once I'm at the top of the tower,
I'll set the arrow to the bow.

1387
01:58:27,476 --> 01:58:28,260
There he is!

1388
01:58:28,311 --> 01:58:29,094
Bard!

1389
01:58:29,145 --> 01:58:31,514
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1390
01:58:31,564 --> 01:58:32,348
Stop him!

1391
01:58:39,614 --> 01:58:40,648
Stop him!

1392
01:58:41,324 --> 01:58:42,107
Stop!

1393
01:58:46,078 --> 01:58:47,947
Bain! Bain.

1394
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:52,451
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone
find it. I'll deal with them.

1395
01:58:52,501 --> 01:58:54,411
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1396
01:58:58,174 --> 01:58:58,999
Braga.

1397
01:58:59,050 --> 01:58:59,875
You're under arrest.

1398
01:58:59,925 --> 01:59:03,003
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1399
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:34,410
Where's he gone?

1400
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:46,755
What about Bilbo?

1401
01:59:46,806 --> 01:59:48,007
Give him more time.

1402
01:59:48,057 --> 01:59:50,426
Time to do what? To be killed?

1403
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:54,138
You're afraid.

1404
01:59:55,606 --> 01:59:58,100
Yes, I'm afraid.

1405
01:59:59,068 --> 02:00:00,603
I fear for you.

1406
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:04,148
A sickness lies upon
that treasure hoard.

1407
02:00:04,365 --> 02:00:06,900
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.

1408
02:00:06,951 --> 02:00:08,736
I am not my grandfather.

1409
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:10,738
You're not yourself.

1410
02:00:11,414 --> 02:00:13,741
The Thorin I know would not
hesitate to go in there...

1411
02:00:13,791 --> 02:00:18,621
I will not risk this
quest for the life of one burglar.

1412
02:00:20,297 --> 02:00:21,916
Bilbo.

1413
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:24,209
His name is Bilbo.

1414
02:00:27,763 --> 02:00:29,757
It's Oakenshield...

1415
02:00:29,849 --> 02:00:33,010
that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1416
02:00:35,062 --> 02:00:37,389
He sent you in here...

1417
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:40,392
for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1418
02:00:40,443 --> 02:00:41,268
No. No...

1419
02:00:41,318 --> 02:00:44,396
no. I don't know what
you're talking about.

1420
02:00:44,447 --> 02:00:45,773
Don't bother denying it.

1421
02:00:46,949 --> 02:00:48,984
I guessed his foul
purpose some time ago.

1422
02:00:51,454 --> 02:00:53,155
But it matters not.

1423
02:00:54,123 --> 02:00:56,700
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1424
02:00:58,502 --> 02:01:00,454
The darkness is coming.

1425
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:05,292
<i>It will spread to every
corner of the land.</i>

1426
02:01:47,676 --> 02:01:49,837
You are being used, Thief...

1427
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:52,214
in the Shadows. You were only...

1428
02:01:52,264 --> 02:01:55,050
ever a means to an end.

1429
02:01:55,684 --> 02:01:56,468
The coward...

1430
02:01:56,519 --> 02:01:59,304
Oakenshield has weighed...

1431
02:01:59,355 --> 02:02:01,140
the value of your life...

1432
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:03,559
and found it worth nothing.

1433
02:02:03,984 --> 02:02:05,352
No.

1434
02:02:05,903 --> 02:02:06,770
No.

1435
02:02:07,863 --> 02:02:09,023
No, you're lying.

1436
02:02:09,073 --> 02:02:10,441
What did he promise you?

1437
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,985
A share of the treasure?

1438
02:02:13,786 --> 02:02:15,112
As if it was his...

1439
02:02:15,162 --> 02:02:16,447
to give.

1440
02:02:17,081 --> 02:02:19,032
I will not part with...

1441
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:20,284
a single coin.

1442
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:23,495
Not one piece of it.

1443
02:02:27,174 --> 02:02:28,250
My teeth...

1444
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:29,668
are swords.

1445
02:02:30,386 --> 02:02:33,881
My claws are spears.

1446
02:02:35,808 --> 02:02:37,176
My Wings...

1447
02:02:37,601 --> 02:02:40,345
are a hurricane.

1448
02:02:45,776 --> 02:02:47,811
So it is true.

1449
02:02:47,987 --> 02:02:50,314
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1450
02:02:50,364 --> 02:02:51,482
What did you say?

1451
02:02:52,116 --> 02:02:56,195
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

1452
02:02:56,245 --> 02:02:57,654
the Tyrannical.

1453
02:02:58,038 --> 02:02:59,323
Truly.

1454
02:02:59,373 --> 02:03:01,533
You have no equal on this earth.

1455
02:03:05,754 --> 02:03:06,622
I am...

1456
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:10,125
almost tempted to let you take it.

1457
02:03:10,384 --> 02:03:12,586
If only to see Oakenshield...

1458
02:03:12,636 --> 02:03:13,796
suffer.

1459
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:15,964
Watch it...

1460
02:03:16,015 --> 02:03:17,716
destroy him.

1461
02:03:18,017 --> 02:03:21,345
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1462
02:03:21,812 --> 02:03:24,389
and drive him mad.

1463
02:03:27,401 --> 02:03:29,186
But I think not.

1464
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:32,022
I think our little game ends here.

1465
02:03:32,656 --> 02:03:34,108
So tell me...

1466
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:35,234
thief...

1467
02:03:35,909 --> 02:03:38,237
how do you choose to die?

1468
02:04:21,497 --> 02:04:22,531
Nah.

1469
02:04:50,693 --> 02:04:52,936
Da? Is that you, Da?

1470
02:05:25,853 --> 02:05:27,387
- Aah!
- Stay down!

1471
02:06:27,998 --> 02:06:28,865
Get down!

1472
02:07:05,202 --> 02:07:06,570
You killed them all.

1473
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:07,904
There are others.

1474
02:07:08,121 --> 02:07:09,406
Tauriel.

1475
02:07:09,706 --> 02:07:10,991
Come.

1476
02:07:14,837 --> 02:07:15,996
We're losing him.

1477
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:21,126
Tauriel.

1478
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,068
Athelas.

1479
02:07:48,704 --> 02:07:50,322
Athelas.

1480
02:07:51,123 --> 02:07:52,407
What are you doing?

1481
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:57,120
I'm going to save him.

1482
02:08:17,691 --> 02:08:19,184
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1483
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:21,267
Did you find the Arkenstone?
The Arkenstone.

1484
02:08:21,293 --> 02:08:22,421
The dragon's coming.

1485
02:08:25,157 --> 02:08:26,942
Did you find it?

1486
02:08:32,247 --> 02:08:33,532
We have to get out.

1487
02:08:37,044 --> 02:08:38,245
Thorin.

1488
02:08:41,757 --> 02:08:43,083
Thorin.

1489
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:15,657
You will burn!

1490
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:17,659
- Run!
- Ah!

1491
02:09:24,591 --> 02:09:25,876
Come on, Bilbo!

1492
02:09:38,563 --> 02:09:39,806
Come on.

1493
02:09:56,748 --> 02:09:58,158
Hold him down.

1494
02:10:14,349 --> 02:10:16,301
Unh! Tilda.

1495
02:11:08,987 --> 02:11:10,355
Shh, Shh, Shh!

1496
02:11:17,996 --> 02:11:19,656
We've given him the slip.

1497
02:11:19,706 --> 02:11:20,907
No.

1498
02:11:21,166 --> 02:11:23,576
He's too cunning for that.

1499
02:11:25,128 --> 02:11:26,454
So where to now?

1500
02:11:26,838 --> 02:11:28,373
The western guardroom.

1501
02:11:28,882 --> 02:11:30,625
There may be a way out.

1502
02:11:30,675 --> 02:11:32,877
It's too high. There's no chance...

1503
02:11:32,928 --> 02:11:35,213
- that way.
- It's our only chance.

1504
02:11:36,348 --> 02:11:38,008
We have to try.

1505
02:11:54,366 --> 02:11:55,734
Come on.

1506
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:46,993
I've heard tell of the
wonders of Elvish medicine.

1507
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:49,954
That was a privilege to witness.

1508
02:12:52,257 --> 02:12:53,625
Tauriel.

1509
02:12:57,721 --> 02:12:59,130
Lie still.

1510
02:13:06,146 --> 02:13:08,431
You cannot be her.

1511
02:13:11,735 --> 02:13:14,104
She is far away.

1512
02:13:18,074 --> 02:13:19,692
She is far...

1513
02:13:19,743 --> 02:13:21,528
far away from me.

1514
02:13:22,954 --> 02:13:25,281
She walks...

1515
02:13:25,332 --> 02:13:28,201
in starlight in another world.

1516
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:35,500
It was just a dream.

1517
02:13:46,978 --> 02:13:49,389
Do you think she could've loved me?

1518
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:57,355
Stay close.

1519
02:14:07,916 --> 02:14:11,995
That's it, then.
There's no way out.

1520
02:14:18,218 --> 02:14:20,628
The last of our kin.

1521
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,426
They must have come here...

1522
02:14:26,893 --> 02:14:28,136
hoping...

1523
02:14:28,186 --> 02:14:29,512
beyond hope.

1524
02:14:39,072 --> 02:14:41,608
We could try to reach the mines.

1525
02:14:42,242 --> 02:14:44,694
We might last a few days.

1526
02:14:46,663 --> 02:14:47,906
No.

1527
02:14:50,667 --> 02:14:53,077
I will not die like this.

1528
02:14:54,254 --> 02:14:55,622
Cowering.

1529
02:14:56,298 --> 02:14:58,291
Clawing for breath.

1530
02:15:03,013 --> 02:15:04,339
We make for the forges.

1531
02:15:04,389 --> 02:15:06,549
He'll see us, sure as death.

1532
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,051
Not if we split up.

1533
02:15:08,101 --> 02:15:08,885
Thorin...

1534
02:15:09,311 --> 02:15:11,012
we'll never make it.

1535
02:15:11,062 --> 02:15:12,764
Some of us might.

1536
02:15:12,981 --> 02:15:15,391
Lead him to the forges.

1537
02:15:15,984 --> 02:15:18,186
We kill the dragon.

1538
02:15:19,696 --> 02:15:22,148
If this is to end in fire...

1539
02:15:22,407 --> 02:15:25,026
then we will all burn together.

1540
02:15:26,119 --> 02:15:27,487
This way.

1541
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:32,534
Flee.

1542
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:34,577
Flee.

1543
02:15:35,378 --> 02:15:37,539
Run for your lives.

1544
02:15:38,089 --> 02:15:39,165
There is...

1545
02:15:39,591 --> 02:15:42,001
nowhere to hide.

1546
02:15:42,052 --> 02:15:43,211
Behind you!

1547
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:44,337
Worm!

1548
02:15:45,263 --> 02:15:46,130
Come on!

1549
02:15:48,308 --> 02:15:49,509
Run!

1550
02:15:51,269 --> 02:15:52,762
Hey, you!

1551
02:15:52,937 --> 02:15:53,805
Here!

1552
02:18:51,658 --> 02:18:53,818
This way. It's this way!

1553
02:18:53,868 --> 02:18:55,194
Come on!

1554
02:18:55,245 --> 02:18:56,028
Thorin!

1555
02:19:01,626 --> 02:19:02,910
Follow Balin!

1556
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:05,371
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1557
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:22,555
Thorin!

1558
02:19:31,447 --> 02:19:32,690
Hold on!

1559
02:20:06,316 --> 02:20:07,850
Thorin!

1560
02:20:10,528 --> 02:20:12,271
Go. Go!

1561
02:20:15,825 --> 02:20:19,695
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1562
02:20:19,746 --> 02:20:21,280
He's right. We've no...

1563
02:20:21,331 --> 02:20:23,866
fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1564
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:27,787
Have we not?

1565
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:32,250
I did not look to see you
so easily outwitted.

1566
02:20:36,012 --> 02:20:39,048
You have grown slow and fat...

1567
02:20:39,682 --> 02:20:40,758
in your dotage...

1568
02:20:43,019 --> 02:20:44,387
slug!

1569
02:20:45,563 --> 02:20:47,431
Take cover. Go!

1570
02:21:14,676 --> 02:21:15,585
Bombur!

1571
02:21:15,677 --> 02:21:17,295
Get those bellows working.

1572
02:21:17,345 --> 02:21:18,629
Go!

1573
02:21:32,235 --> 02:21:33,019
Bilbo!

1574
02:21:33,069 --> 02:21:35,021
Up there. On my mark...

1575
02:21:35,071 --> 02:21:36,564
pull that lever.

1576
02:21:46,874 --> 02:21:49,410
Balin! Can you still
mix a flash-flame?

1577
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:52,038
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy.
Come on!

1578
02:21:53,589 --> 02:21:55,249
We don't have a jiffy.

1579
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:08,346
Where's the sulfur?

1580
02:22:08,521 --> 02:22:10,473
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1581
02:22:22,035 --> 02:22:23,027
Come on!

1582
02:22:45,141 --> 02:22:46,008
Now!

1583
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:44,835
Lead him to the
Gallery of the Kings.

1584
02:25:32,725 --> 02:25:34,051
Keep going, Bilbo!

1585
02:25:34,268 --> 02:25:35,553
Run!

1586
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:21,891
You think you...

1587
02:26:21,941 --> 02:26:24,101
can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1588
02:26:27,446 --> 02:26:30,649
You have come from Lake-town.

1589
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:33,652
This is some...

1590
02:26:33,703 --> 02:26:37,156
sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

1591
02:26:37,206 --> 02:26:40,576
and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1592
02:26:41,377 --> 02:26:43,495
Those sniveling cowards...

1593
02:26:43,546 --> 02:26:45,206
with their long bows...

1594
02:26:45,256 --> 02:26:48,292
and Black Arrows.

1595
02:26:48,467 --> 02:26:50,544
Perhaps it is time...

1596
02:26:50,594 --> 02:26:52,671
I paid them a visit.

1597
02:26:53,014 --> 02:26:54,465
Oh, no.

1598
02:26:56,142 --> 02:26:57,801
This isn't their fault!

1599
02:26:57,852 --> 02:26:58,844
Wait!

1600
02:26:58,894 --> 02:27:00,679
You cannot go to Lake-town!

1601
02:27:02,398 --> 02:27:04,767
You care about them...

1602
02:27:05,276 --> 02:27:06,727
you?

1603
02:27:06,777 --> 02:27:07,937
Good.

1604
02:27:08,446 --> 02:27:09,230
Then you can...

1605
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,065
watch them die.

1606
02:27:16,412 --> 02:27:17,738
Here!

1607
02:27:18,456 --> 02:27:19,573
You witless worm.

1608
02:27:26,297 --> 02:27:27,873
You.

1609
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:30,751
I am taking back what you stole.

1610
02:27:34,597 --> 02:27:35,464
You...

1611
02:27:35,514 --> 02:27:37,299
will take nothing...

1612
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:39,218
from me...

1613
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:40,636
Dwarf.

1614
02:27:40,936 --> 02:27:44,390
I laid low your warriors...

1615
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,267
of old.

1616
02:27:46,317 --> 02:27:48,894
I instilled terror in...

1617
02:27:48,944 --> 02:27:50,813
the hearts of Men.

1618
02:27:51,781 --> 02:27:53,399
I am...

1619
02:27:53,449 --> 02:27:55,025
King Under...

1620
02:27:55,326 --> 02:27:57,319
the Mountain.

1621
02:27:57,578 --> 02:28:00,030
This is not your kingdom.

1622
02:28:00,081 --> 02:28:02,283
These are Dwarf lands.

1623
02:28:02,833 --> 02:28:03,909
This is Dwarf gold.

1624
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:07,079
And we will...

1625
02:28:07,129 --> 02:28:09,498
have our revenge.

1626
02:29:30,838 --> 02:29:31,830
Revenge?!

1627
02:29:33,507 --> 02:29:35,334
Revenge?!

1628
02:29:35,926 --> 02:29:40,047
I will show you revenge!

1629
02:30:17,343 --> 02:30:18,585
Listen to me!

1630
02:30:18,928 --> 02:30:21,422
Do you not know what is coming?

1631
02:30:23,641 --> 02:30:27,553
I am fire.

1632
02:30:28,562 --> 02:30:31,265
I am...

1633
02:30:33,275 --> 02:30:34,810
death.

1634
02:30:43,327 --> 02:30:45,738
What have we done?
