00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,765
[man] <i>What do you see
beyond this wall?</i>

3
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,433
<i>Picture it.</i>

4
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:18,603
<i>You've got an imagination.
Go ahead.</i>

5
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,375
What I see is a small town
in the Midwest.

6
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,578
Handful of churches.

7
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:30,314
Some places for the farmers
to get drunk together.

8
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,481
Maybe a salon

9
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:35,320
for their wives to do their hair
on the holidays.

10
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,224
I visit these places.

11
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,859
These are the people
who send us our profits,

12
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,897
who send us your wages.

13
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,698
I make movies, Judy,
but it's your job

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,002
to give those people dreams.

15
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,606
The economy's in the gutter,
and they pay for you.

16
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,275
And I'll tell you
something else.

17
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,944
In every one of those towns,
believe me,

18
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:04,414
there's a girl
who's prettier than you.

19
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:08,385
Maybe their nose is a little
thinner at the bridge.

20
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,988
They have better teeth than you.

21
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,625
Or they're taller
or they're slimmer.

22
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:17,059
Only, you have something

23
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,463
none of those pretty girls
can ever have.

24
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,698
You know what that is?

25
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:24,936
No, sir.

26
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,272
[man] You have that voice.

27
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:31,342
It'll maybe take you to Oz,

28
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,879
someplace none of those pretty
girls can ever go.

29
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,383
Still, I'm told you're unhappy.

30
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:42,453
[Judy]
Well, no, sir, not unhappy.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,823
I'd just maybe like a little
more time.

32
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,960
Time? For what?

33
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,062
I don't know.

34
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,565
Maybe to go to the pictures
like those other girls do.

35
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,704
The thing is, those other girls
will grow up to be cashiers

36
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:03,573
and farmers' wives
and elementary school teachers.

37
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:07,078
And they'll see their skins
roughed up through housework.

38
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:09,846
Is that what you want, Judy?

39
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:11,983
To be just a housewife?

40
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:14,651
To be just a mother?

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,786
Out there,

42
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:20,121
you'd have to put away
that voice of yours.

43
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,725
Forget it exists.

44
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:25,463
But here, with us,
with your family,

45
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,429
that voice will make you
a million dollars

46
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:29,667
before you're 20.

47
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:39,476
Those average kids,
they're all loved, in their way.

48
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,744
I can see how you
may be drawn to it,

49
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,782
from time to time.
Their small lives.

50
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,652
Not too dangerous.
Not too exciting.

51
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,688
They're where they belong.

52
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:55,126
And maybe you feel like
you're like them.

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,762
But really, you're not.

54
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:01,032
You live in another world
entirely.

55
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,935
They just look like you.

56
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,906
But if you truly wanna
go join them,

57
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:10,875
it's your decision.

58
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,545
We'll shake hands and you
can walk through our gates.

59
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:18,783
I guarantee it's all there,

60
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,082
the rest of America,

61
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:25,923
just waiting to swallow you up
and forget all about you.

62
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,661
Like a raindrop
falling into the Pacific.

63
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,431
Who cares? Who even notices?

64
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:36,099
Of course I wanna stay
with the studio, LB.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,669
Any girl would kill
to be Dorothy.

66
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,038
I'm just terribly sorry if...

67
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:45,042
I didn't even say anything
to anyone.

68
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,613
[Mayer]
You're my favorite, Judy.

69
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,118
- Who else have we had in?
- Shirley Temple this morning.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,524
Everybody loves Shirley.

71
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,793
Let's see how Judy measures up.

72
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,995
[Judy] Joey, did you grow again?

73
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:41,998
[Joey] I guess.

74
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,033
Oh! Well, could you at least
do it all at once?

75
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:47,805
Just get it over with
one weekend?

76
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:51,209
'Cause it's a new pair of pants
every time you add an inch.

77
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,811
Dad says vitamins
make me grow.

78
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,712
So, we'll cut those out.

79
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,182
Oh, I'm kidding, darling.

80
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:01,149
It's a wonderful thing
to have a son big enough

81
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,153
he can carry his mother
to the car.

82
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,557
Lorna, sweetheart,
let me see you.

83
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,156
[Lorna] What are we doing first?

84
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:10,194
Oh, the usual. Is that okay?

85
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,627
- Yeah.
- You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

86
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:14,665
- [man] So, I have your money.
- Oh.

87
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,998
[man chuckles]
Crowd's gonna go crazy

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,199
- out there.
- Aw.

89
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,071
[man] So, it's $150.

90
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:21,404
Uh, I know it's not maybe

91
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,873
- what you're used to, but...
- No, no, I appreciate it.

92
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,110
- [man] All right.
- I do.

93
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,978
- Okay, you ready?
- Sure.

94
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:30,113
- Follow me.
- Go on.

95
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,014
[announcer] <i>All right, folks...</i>

96
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,784
We'll just do what we did
in New York, yeah?

97
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:38,019
[announcer] <i>Hope you're ready.
Put your hands together.</i>

98
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,687
Okay, let's go, let's go.

99
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,089
How are you tonight, Altadena?

100
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,723
[announcer] <i>One of Hollywood's
true legends,</i>

101
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,858
<i>Miss Judy Garland.</i>

102
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,728
[Judy] <i>Well, I've got something
very special</i>

103
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,066
<i>planned for you this evening.
I've brought my children along.</i>

104
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,902
[inaudible singing]

105
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,237
[muffled cheering]

106
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:12,689
[groans]

107
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:15,258
What a journey.

108
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,562
I'm sorry it's so late.

109
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,831
How you doing, Georgie?

110
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,865
I'm okay, thank you,
Miss Garland. And you?

111
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,101
Oh, stumbling along.

112
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,139
Any messages
while we were out of town?

113
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,139
Uh, I don't think so.

114
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,945
Okay. Well, could I just
have my key, please?

115
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,949
Let me check something
with Mr. Horowitz. One moment.

116
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,686
Can we get room service, Mama?
I missed dinner.

117
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,288
Sure, sweetheart.
Anything you want.

118
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:49,726
- [Horowitz] Miss Garland.
- Oh, please. I'm Judy.

119
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,096
- Could I have a word?
- Can it wait?

120
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,230
We're just desperate
to get to bed.

121
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,132
Lorna, darling,
tell Peter what you want

122
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:58,636
and he'll take care of it.

123
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,303
A hamburger and fries, please.

124
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:03,741
Oh, and, you know,
I'd love a bowl of soup.

125
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,709
And a drink.
Vodka rocks.

126
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,308
You know what, forget the soup.

127
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,848
I'm too tired to even
wield a spoon. [chuckles]

128
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,985
I'm very sorry, but your suite
has been released.

129
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,622
What do you mean, "released"?

130
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,990
It's not still attached
to the building?

131
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,959
Where exactly has it gone?
[chuckles]

132
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,795
I believe your account
was in arrears.

133
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,366
Oh. No. No, I don't...
I don't think that's the case.

134
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,901
- The room got released.
- So un-release it.

135
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,069
Hand it back.
We need to sleep in it.

136
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:35,969
- Is everything okay?
- No. No, darling.

137
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,274
These people have let us
down very badly

138
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,910
leaving us stranded without so
much as a change of socks.

139
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,280
Everything is in storage.

140
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,980
I could have rooms
anywhere in this city,

141
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,217
but I chose this hotel.

142
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,085
Well, not anymore.

143
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,390
I wouldn't let my worst enemy
stay here.

144
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:55,292
Let's just go.

145
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:57,995
Outraged.

146
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,067
Come on, sweetheart.

147
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,512
- Please don't go to sleep now.
- No, no, no.

148
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,049
These are the other ones.

149
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,990
- Where are we going?
- The Roosevelt.

150
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,192
[Lorna]
Didn't we stay there last year?

151
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,462
Sure.
But they like us.

152
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:36,966
Mama.

153
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,873
Could we head toward Brentwood,
please?

154
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,314
Joe, get the bell,
would you, darling?

155
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:52,817
[bell dings]

156
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,094
So, you wanna stay?

157
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:04,828
No.

158
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,163
And they're only
staying tonight.

159
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:09,930
- So, they have school tomorrow.
- I know that.

160
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,035
They slept in the cab.
They'll be fine.

161
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:14,938
I probably paid more
on cab fare tonight

162
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,507
than I would've on a hotel.

163
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,307
- What about tomorrow night?
- What about it?

164
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,877
- Come on. Don't play that game.
- Well, you're needling me, Sid.

165
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,879
- Just ask me a straight question
- All right,

166
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:28,049
where are my children
gonna sleep tomorrow night?

167
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,220
Wherever I tell them.

168
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:31,221
[floorboards creaking]

169
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,521
[Judy] Hi, sweetheart.

170
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,024
- Something wrong?
- [Sid] Hey.

171
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:38,328
- I... I can't sleep.
- You want some milk?

172
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,528
- Come here.
- [Sid] No, you go to bed.

173
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,234
We'll bring it to you, okay?
Don't worry.

174
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,773
[Judy] Where are the mugs?

175
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,307
I moved them.

176
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,076
They're where the glasses were.

177
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,780
- Ridiculous.
- [chuckles]

178
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,020
Couldn't you just take a role
in something?

179
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,556
I'm "unreliable."

180
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,958
And "uninsurable."

181
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:14,030
That's what the ones who like me
say to my face.

182
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:16,567
So, thank you for that.

183
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,035
Leave me out of it.

184
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,339
"Judy, leave it to me
and you'll be back on top."

185
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,608
- Look how that turned out.
- "Where is she, Sid?

186
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,042
Is she sick?

187
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,344
- Is she coming in today?"
- Don't.

188
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:31,912
- "Where's your star?"
- Don't.

189
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:33,915
"You realize we're gonna have
to sue you both, Sid."

190
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,049
- Don't start.
- "Why are you

191
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,420
even protecting her, Sid?

192
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:39,353
- What's going on?"
- Oh, shut up, Sid!

193
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,488
You can't turn up here
at one o'clock in the morning

194
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,557
- and expect...
- I know they should be in bed!

195
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,158
It just doesn't always
work that way.

196
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,496
And it gets late because nobody
wants to pay to see me

197
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,031
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

198
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,532
And I have to work,
because they need things.

199
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:55,270
They need an education, Judy.
They need ten hours of sleep.

200
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,405
Oh, just to hell with this.
Just call me a cab.

201
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,243
I want custody
during the school year.

202

Over my dead body.

203
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,151
Well, no one would be surprised,
believe me.

204
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:15,625
Give me the milk.

205
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:17,927
Give me the milk!

206
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,570
It's a little late for all that,
don't you think?

207
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:34,011
Why don't you see yourself out?

208

[siren wailing in distance]

00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,901

Look at that. She shows.

What, am I early?

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,323
- You look fabulous.
- [Judy] Liza, darling,

221
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,259
you look beautiful.

222
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,594
I can't believe you came.
What are you doing here?

223
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:28,298
Well, I wanted to see you,
darling.

224
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,233
Are you in L.A. for a while?

Well, I never know, you know,
these days. [chuckles]

226
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,570
I have a show
opening in two days.

227
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:38,142
- You do? Really?
- Mm. Yeah.

228
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:42,209
- And how do you feel about it?
- I don't know.

229
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:44,545
I know my lines
and it's all in my range.

230
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:46,716
I guess I haven't really
thought about it that much.

231
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:50,218
You're not even
a little anxious about it?

232
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,523
- Well, should I be anxious?
- Well...

233
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,693
I mean, no.

234
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,729
- No.
- [Liza chuckles]

235
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:03,498
Um, we were off to go dance.

236
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,134
Will you come with us?

237
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,733
No, no.

238
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,472
No, you go.
I'll catch up to you.

Excuse me. This is for you.

242
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,694
We can't have the world's
greatest entertainer

243
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,231
out here without a drink.

244
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,235
- Frank Sinatra's here?
- [Mickey laughs]

245
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,673
Frank is great,
but he is no Judy Garland.

246
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,475
I bet it kills him.

247
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:46,442
[laughing]

248
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,182
- I'm Mickey, by the way.
- Judy.

249
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,322
So, you live in Los Angeles,
Mickey?

250
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:01,357
Mm. No, I manage a bar
back in New York.

251
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,694
I'm out here looking
at a business opportunity.

252
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,194
[Judy] Hmm.

253
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,264
You ever make your own
cocktails?

254
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,330
- Hmm.
- This place, we sell the booze,

255
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,767
and all the mixings and stuff
is on the tables,

256
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,835
so you get to invent
something of your own.

257
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:16,403
You know, it's fun.

258
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:18,238
People drink more
'cause they wanna be part

259
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,739
of the next new thing,
you know.

260
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,144
- Oh?
- I don't know.

261
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,480
You have to have ambitions,
right?

262
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,715
Well, I used to have them.

263
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,815
I found they gave me
the most terrible headache.

264
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:29,752
Well...

265
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,456
if you wanna create
the Judy Garland martini,

266
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:33,790
that's me.

267
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,692
- Mr. Mickey Deans.
- Yep.

268
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,327
Hmm.

269
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,596
You have kids, Mickey?

270

Uh, no. No, I don't.

271
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,435
Hmm. Well, you shouldn't.

272
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,639
It's like living with your heart
on the outside of your body.

Find a hobby or something,
like canasta or birdwatching.

00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,911
Well, I play piano, actually.

276
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:58,414
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

277
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,151
You play anything
or you just sing?

278
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,519
Just sing?

279

[laughing] Sorry.
That's not what I...

00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:08,623
- Did that come out wrong?
- My entire childhood

I must've slept five
hours total.

It's a wonder
I learned to use cutlery,

283
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,365
let alone play the violin.

284
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,337
We've changed our minds. We're
gonna head to Andy's place.

285
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,441
Will you come?

286
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,378
I don't know.
I think I might stay.

287
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,447
Well, you don't know
anyone here.

seems to know me.

Besides, I wanna stay somewhere
for longer than five minutes.

just toss a drink at me
or something, okay?

307

- I will, don't worry.

Hell, no.

a good time, huh?

Well, we're not done yet,
are we?

315
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:52,756
I hope not.

316
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,694
If you ever wanna get together,
just... click your heels.

317
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:00,796
That's how it works, right?

318
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,671
[man] You gotta at least
eat some.

Those are too good.

You're gonna have to,
I don't know,

324

tie my hands to the chair legs.
Only then

325
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,740
I'd probably lean forward
and grab 'em with my mouth.

so as I know how to look at you.

sometime in the future.

You gotta ask Mr. Mayer.
I think it's just pals.

if that's what you're after.

[publicist] No hamburger.

Mr. Mayer said very specifically
you were not to eat the food.

343

I'm honestly very hungry.

344
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,103
Those'll take the edge off.

345
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,472
No, I gotta sleep tonight.

346
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:53,476
Halpert will give you something
for that later. Down the hatch.

00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:02,882
- [publicist] ...get set up.
- Let her at least take a bite.

349
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:04,218
[publicist]
We can't have a Dorothy

350
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,085
who puts on weight
halfway through the picture.

351
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,154
- His words, not mine.
- [man] Can you take another bite

352
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,826
with your head to the side,
Mr. Rooney?

353
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,862
[indistinct chatter]

354
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:15,228
- [man 1] Yeah. That's our shot!
- [man 2] That's great stuff.

355
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,567
- [cameras clicking]
- [man 3] That's great, Judy!

356
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,043
[man] Okay. Right.

357
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:30,080
- Okay.
- [hangs up phone receiver]

358
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,980
So, that was Sid's lawyers
on the phone.

359
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:35,719
- Why?
- [man] He wants them

360
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:39,186
Sunday through Friday
during school time.

361
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,892
- No.
- He claims you're homeless.

362
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:45,159
How's he even
paying for a lawyer?

363
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,497
He's not making money
off me anymore.

364
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,566
So, where are you staying?

365
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,568
I love my children.
I take care of them.

366
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:54,634
Where'd you stay last night?

367
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:55,871
With a friend.

368
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,038
And is that somewhere maybe
you could take the kids to stay?

369
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,676
I don't have a home.

370
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:04,146
I can't even get a manager.

371
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:07,750
Step right up
and take 10% of my debts.

372
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,052
You know what I'm gonna say.

373
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:13,554
- [Judy groans]
- London would offer you

374
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:14,958
- a lot of money
- No.

375
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:16,957
See, they're crazy for you.

376
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,125
It's because the English
are insane.

377
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,894
Look, start earning again.

378
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:23,098
Then Sid's people
will have nothing on you.

379
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,634
Lorna does adore London.

380
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:27,971
Honey...

381
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:31,238
the courts won't let you
take them out of the country.

382
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,842
So, you're saying
I have to leave my children

383
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:37,878
if I wanna make enough money
to be with my children?

384
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,015
I know it's hard.

385
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:42,719
But I think you have
to take this seriously.

386
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:46,823
I can't.

387
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,135
Thank you.

388
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:11,515
Oh, God.

389
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,954
[Joe] You'll miss Christmas.

390
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,924
Well, you see, darling,
the problem is that...

391
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,528
I don't currently own a chimney

392
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:28,197
for Santa to climb down,
so I'm no good to you kids.

393
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:31,768
But I'll be back
for New Year's, okay?

394
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,306
Joey.

395
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:37,973
Joe.

396
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:42,176
Darling, I have to fix things,
okay,

397
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:44,981
so I can see you every day,
the whole of every day.

398
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:49,149
I just need a little money
to make that happen.

399
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:50,820
Where would we live then?

400
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm going to find us a new home
for the three of us,

401
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:55,756
so don't you get
too comfortable here.

402
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:57,861
I'm coming straight back
for you.

403
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,730
I am.

404
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:05,068
Or maybe...

405
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:08,971
I could...

406
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:13,643
just hide out in here...

407
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:17,814
with Nibbles instead.

408
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,016
[gasps]

409
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:24,220
Okay.

410
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:30,093
[door opens]

411
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:32,929
Shh.

412
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:46,175
Ooh, it's very spacious in here.

413
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:50,312
I might just have a bathroom
plumbed in.

414
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:53,349
You wouldn't mind,
would you, Joe?

415
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:54,918
[Joe] <i>I'd love it.</i>

416
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:59,689
Well, maybe I'll stay put, hmm?

417
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,058
Would you visit me
once in a while?

418
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:04,927
In Joey's wardrobe?

419
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,163
Oh, sure.

420
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,166
- There's room for three.
- [Lorna chuckles]

421
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,336
- [footsteps]
- [door opens]

422
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,641
Well, come on in.

423
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:22,709
Do you wanna... Do you guys
wanna play tennis or something?

424
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:23,879
There's a court over there.

425
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:26,416
Aw.

426
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:30,019
I do like it here.

427
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:37,394
I would very much like to stay.

428
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:44,067
- [photographers shouting] Judy!
- [cameras clicking]

429
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:52,206
Hello, darling. Hello.
Hello, darling. Hello.

430
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,411
- I love you.
- I love you too, darling.

431
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,847
- Welcome to the Picador.
- Thank you very much.

432
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:01,050
Thank you.

433
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:04,250
- Hello.
- Welcome, Miss Garland.

434
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:05,454
Oh, thank you.

435
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:09,058
- [Bernard] Ah, there she is.
- [Judy chuckles]

436
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:12,258
- The fabulous Miss Judy Garland.
- Oh.

437
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,963
- Bernard Delfont. How are you?
- How wonderful. I'm good.

438
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:17,029
I just adore London,

439
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:19,533
- my home away from home.
- [Bernard chuckles] Marvelous.

440
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,000
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

441
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:22,004
- Hello.
- Hello.

442
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:23,871
I'm Rosalyn Wilder.
I'll be looking after you

443
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,109
- while you're in London.
- Wonderful.

444
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,111
Oh, lovely.

445
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:30,480
We have a schedule
printed for you.

446
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,883
How old are you?

447
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:36,953
I'm... I'm 28.

448
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:41,458
Oh, it is a little cold in here.

449
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,761
[Rosalyn]
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

450
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:47,497
I'll have somebody
look into that right away.

451
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:49,399
Thank you.

452
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,900
Everywhere else I go,

453
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,001
it seems they just
knock the place down

454
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:57,139
and start over as soon
as I leave.

455
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,443
I come back the next year
and I have no idea where I am.

456
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:06,215
London just sort of slaps on
another coat of paint.

457
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,915
I suppose we're rather
old-fashioned.

458
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,753
Oh, no, I like it.

459
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,788
I like it.

460
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:14,988
It's comforting.

461
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,289
Call me if you need anything.

462
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,357
I'll leave my card
for you on the table here.

463
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,962
It's beside the schedule.

464
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:23,532
Hadn't forgotten the...
[British accent] schedule.

465
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,302
I... I really do appreciate it.

466
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,038
- We'll see you tomorrow morning.
- See you tomorrow.

467
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:31,840
[door closes]

468
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,945
[Rosalyn] Thank you.
Right, here we are.

469
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:12,048
[Judy] Here?

470
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,113
- Really?
- [Rosalyn] Mm-hmm.

471
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:17,086
We do all our rehearsals here.
The acoustic is wonderful.

472
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:18,387
This way.

473
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:22,325
[Burt]
<i>♪ So... So... Somewhere ♪</i>

474
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,226
<i>♪ Over the rainbow ♪</i>

475
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:28,061
[Judy]
Well, that sounds familiar.

476
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,096
[chuckles] Judy,
this is our band leader,

477
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:31,931
Burt Rhodes. Burt, Judy.

478
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:32,999
- It's...
- [Judy] Hello, Burt.

479
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,102
...an honor to be working
with you, Ms. Garland.

480
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:36,405
I've been an admirer
for a long time.

481
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,173
Well, I like this one.

482
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:39,976
He can stay.

483
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:42,611
The whole town
is talking about you.

484
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:45,278
Oh, well,
let's not dwell on that.

485
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,250
Oh, no.
It's completely sold out.

486
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,518
[Burt] Hmm!

487
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:52,120
[Judy chuckles]

488
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,332
Miss Garland?

489
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:05,601
Do you need anything
or should we dive in?

490
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,403
You know,
it's really damp in here.

491
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,974
I don't think rehearsing
is a good idea.

492
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,979
Right.

493
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,248
- Uh...
- You understand, darling?

494
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:22,085
Okay, well, how about we talk
about the band positions?

495
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:24,988
Okay.

496
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,624
Well, I'm going to be here.

497
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:31,627
And this, this is the mark-up
for the stage.

498
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:34,898
Hmm.

499
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,303
Right.
And where's the audience?

500
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:43,038
Wrapped around you,
all three sides.

501
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:44,139
Mm-hmm.

502
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:47,543
- And they're on one level?
- [Rosalyn] Four.

503
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,620
How many tiers
was Carnegie Hall?

504
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:00,455
[Judy] Five.

505
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:09,296
[piano playing]

506
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:11,601
We can discuss the songs
if you really want to.

507
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:14,200
[Burt] I have all your charts.

508
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:15,602
Any changes
you might like to make?

509
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:17,170
No, everything the same.

510
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:19,139
[Burt] Is there anything
to discuss, then?

511
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,977
Sweetheart, that's up to you.

512
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:24,280
I don't particularly need
to discuss anything.

513
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:27,213
[Rosalyn]
Judy, I'm afraid the critics

514
00:30:27,215 --> 00:30:29,985
- will review opening night.
- Sure.

515
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,322
Of course.

516
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,558
- It's tomorrow.
- I'd like to rest.

517
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,966
<i>Hi. It's Judy.</i>

518
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:44,599
Are the kids there?

519
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,334
Will you tell them
that I called?

520
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:51,606
And that I'll try them again
at this time tomorrow?

521
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,708
<i>And I'd like them
to be on the line</i>

522
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,679
<i>next time I call, okay?</i>

523
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,521
[humming, clears throat, coughs]

524
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:13,762
[continues humming,

525
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:31,147
[continues humming]

526
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:41,790
- Good evening, Miss Garland.
- And to you. [chuckles]

527
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,260
Oh, do... Do you have the time?

528
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,626
[man]
It's 3:00 in the morning, ma'am.

529
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,598
- Oh.
- [man] Can I get you anything?

530
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,636
I am having a little trouble
sleeping.

531
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:57,339
Some warm milk, perhaps?

532
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:00,476
Sure.

533
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,478
Thank you.
I'll try anything once.

534
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,449
[man] I'll have them bring it
up to you straightaway.

535
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:08,317
Thank you.

536
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:35,077
[salsa music playing]

[coughs]

542
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,526
- Has the stage door called yet?
- Not yet.

543
00:33:27,628 --> 00:33:28,663
She's late.

544
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,470
[Rosalyn] Hello. Can we
go to the Picador, please?

545
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:55,657
- [knocks]
- Judy?

546
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,861
- [knocking on door]
- <i>Judy, it's Rosalyn.</i>

547
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,297
<i>How are you?</i>

548
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:03,798
I don't feel too good.

549
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:05,867
[Rosalyn]
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

550
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:09,371
- I said I don't feel good.
- [door opens]

551
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:13,775
What kind of goddamn
lock is that?

552
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:17,911
[scoffs] If I lock a door,
I like it to stay that way.

553
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:20,182
[Rosalyn] That's completely
understandable.

554
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:23,451
Now, this is Vivian. She's going
to take your temperature.

555
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,589
Take a sip of this.

556
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:30,326
Tongue out for me.

557
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,396
Lips together for me, darling.

558
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:36,929
What's the prognosis?

559
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,201
No spots, no fever,
throat's fine.

560
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:40,903
Go for a nice red lippy.

561
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:45,505
[Rosalyn] What do you
think of this, Judy?

562
00:34:45,507 --> 00:34:46,840
[Vivian] Oh, it's very pretty.

563
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,541
Put some silver dust
on your cheekbones.

564
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,845
You'll look incredible.

565
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,716
Are you a nurse or what?

566
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,284
Yeah, if you like.

567
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:57,617
[Rosalyn] Take an arm of this,
Vivian. You can finish that

568
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,721
- on the way.
- Yeah.

569
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:02,054
[Rosalyn] Now, oopsy-daisy.

570
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,923
- There we go. One leg in.
- [Judy] Oh, God.

571
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:04,990
That's it.

572
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:05,994
Shoes.

573
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:07,862
- There we go.
- Hey!

574
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:13,568
[sighs] You look
absolutely incredible.

575
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,438
All right!
All right, all right

576
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,842
[Rosalyn] We can't wait
to show you off.

577
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:22,909
I felt so terrible earlier.

578
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,543
[Rosalyn] Well,
you do work very hard.

579
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:26,014
You're under a lot of pressure.

580
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:27,949
[Judy] Since I was two.

581
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,450
[Rosalyn] Judy Garland,
born in a trunk.

582
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:33,489
[Judy laughs]
That's what I say.

583
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:35,891
[Rosalyn] Right.

584
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:38,460
Now...

585
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,601
Wait, wait. What are we...

586
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,803
It's opening night, Judy.

587
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:51,474
Oh, yes, of course.

588
00:35:56,744 --> 00:35:58,043
[elevator dings]

589
00:35:58,045 --> 00:35:59,514
Well, here we are.

[camera clicking]

594
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,057
[Judy] Hello. Hello, darling.

595
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:43,822
- Hello. Hello, darling.
- [Rosalyn] Excuse me. Thank you.

596
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:46,428
- [Judy] I love you too, darling.
- [Rosalyn] Yes, yes. Thank you.

597
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:47,929
Let... Let us through, please.

598
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,436
- [man] Hello, Judy.
- [Judy] Are those for me?

599
00:36:57,438 --> 00:36:59,773
- These are for you.
- Oh, they're beautiful.

600
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:02,441
- You mean so much to us.
- We wanted you to know.

601
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,646
Gentlemen, sorry, but Judy
is running extremely late now.

602
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:06,679
Thank you, ladies.
Clear the way.

603
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:08,684
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

604
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:12,621
It's right up here, Judy.

605
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,028
Okay, here we go, boys.

606
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:25,965
- [music stops]
- What's the matter?

607
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:27,166
[panting]

608
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,034
- [man] Ladies and gentlemen...
- I can't.

609
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,570
What? No, no, no.
What do you mean, you can't?

610
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:33,606
There's an audience out there
waiting to hear you sing.

611
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,775
My mouth's dry
and it could fall apart.

612
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:37,844
- No. Listen to me.
- I can't.

613
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:40,548
You'll be fine.
Now, on you go.

614
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:41,850
[applause]

615
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:47,155

00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:06,441
And I love you, too.

618

[laughter]

619
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,844
In fact, I love this whole town.

620
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:13,047
Though you will always be
special.

- [blows kiss]
- [applause]

622
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:21,123
You know, the first time...

623
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:22,891
I sang...

624
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:26,127
on a stage,
I was all of two years old.

625
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:30,699
They say my papa
had to come and drag me off

626
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:35,503
after I started singing the same
song for the fifth time.

627
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:37,506
[laughter]

628
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,916

[laughter]

630
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:52,621

put them to use.

Hmm. Okay.

00:43:32,032 --> 00:43:34,469
There's absolutely no rush.
Take your time.

687
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:40,943
Can I, uh, get you anything?

688
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:42,978
No. No, no.

689
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:53,521
I thought you were very good.

690
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:01,829
What if I can't do it again?

691
00:44:03,264 --> 00:44:04,266
[chuckles]

692
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:10,739
Oh.

693
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:17,146
- A mess.
- Here. Let me have a go at it.

694
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:22,083
- [chuckles]
- There.

695
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:31,559
- Perfect. [laughs]
- Brand new. [chuckles]

- Judy Garland turns 16.

712

how you seem to bypass the ears
and land here.

for something a little better

You can't really mess up
an omelet.

00:52:32,706 --> 00:52:34,572
I put cream in it.

816
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,974
- Why would you put cream in?
- To make it more special.

817
00:52:36,976 --> 00:52:39,445
And instead you've simply
made it not work.

818
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,746
Yes, I'm aware of that.

for being an omelet,

- I'm sure. Put that spoon down.

would you?

from now on.

or hide in there all night?

I'm not sure
that was even scrambled eggs.

838
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:31,662
Well, we know some eggs
went into the pan.

839
00:53:31,664 --> 00:53:33,701
- We witnessed that.
- Mm-hmm.

840
00:53:41,842 --> 00:53:43,411

anything wrong after all.

[knocking on door]

875
00:57:24,632 --> 00:57:25,900
[Judy] No, thank you.

876
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:29,637
[knocking continues]

877
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,673
No, thank you.

878
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:34,775
[knocking louder]

[banging on door]

881
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,686
What?

882
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:49,287
- Room service.
- I didn't order anything.

883
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:51,822
It's the first sleep
I've gotten in weeks!

884
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:53,260
And you woke me up.

885
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,597
There's a man under the trolley.

886
00:57:57,164 --> 00:57:58,262
What?

887
00:57:58,264 --> 00:57:59,766
- [Mickey] Hey, baby.
- [clattering]

888
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:02,903
- Surprise.
- [gasps]

889
00:58:04,038 --> 00:58:05,173
Mickey?

890
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:07,775
[laughing]

891
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:12,679
What are you doing here?
I can't believe it.

892
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:20,786
What a wonderful surprise.

893
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,056
- [huffs]
- Oh!

894
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:26,259
Oh. [chuckles] Well...

895
00:58:27,728 --> 00:58:30,932
- this is me.
- Yeah, it's nice, it's nice.

896
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:33,835
- [Judy] When did you get here?
- Just now.

897
00:58:34,134 --> 00:58:35,400
- Yeah?
- Literally.

898
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,001
I just walked off the plane.

899
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,007
- I'm just passing through.
- Where are you staying?

900
00:58:40,373 --> 00:58:42,807
I don't know. I don't know.
I literally just showed up.

901
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:44,144
I haven't thought
about anything.

902
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,247
Well, stay here.

903
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:48,248
Yeah?

904
00:58:49,717 --> 00:58:51,885
- I'm drowning in space.
- [Mickey chuckles]

905
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,989
Yeah, no, I mean, that...
That sounds great.

906
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:00,961
Okay. I'll stay here, then.
[chuckles]

907
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,266
It's so good to see you again.

908
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:11,105
[Mickey]
You ever tried a crumpet?

909
00:59:11,905 --> 00:59:14,005
- [Judy] Mm.
- [groans] It's like a pancake

910
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:15,842
that's had the living shit
kicked out of it.

911
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:18,045
- [Judy laughs]
- You gonna eat something?

912
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:22,380
No, no. No, I'm fine.

913
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:24,916
[Mickey] Well, have some eggs.
The tomatoes are pretty good.

914
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:25,920
I'm fine.

915
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,387
Come on, have a bite.

916
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:29,887
What do you wanna do?

917
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:30,891
I'm easy.

918
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:34,092
Maybe, uh... get a drink

919
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,396
- with your friends.
- Sure.

920
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:37,699
We could get the gang together.

921
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:40,802
I'll make some calls.

922
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:47,175
Yeah, it's okay.

923
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:50,010
It's just okay?

924
00:59:51,077 --> 00:59:52,346
It's a little old-ladyish.

925
01:00:00,186 --> 01:00:01,822
[chuckles]
I'm just saying.

926
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:04,325
You got great legs.

927
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:06,291
Show them off.

928
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:07,327
Yeah?

929
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:09,029
Yeah.

930
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:12,099
Wow.

931
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,737
Wish there was a little more
of them. [chuckles]

932
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,805
So, let's go shopping, baby.

933
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:20,041
Hmm?

934
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:22,943
- Get you dolled up.
- I don't know.

935
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:26,980
Oh, come on.
A woman's gotta wear something.

936
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:30,184
- Or not, right?
- [laughing]

937
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:31,184
Look out.

938
01:00:31,885 --> 01:00:33,955
Don't kill America's sweetheart
here.

939
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:37,354
All right. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

940
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:39,858
Oh, yeah, I have a great idea
for a new shop.

941
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,062
[Judy] Oh? What's that?

942
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:50,267
It's great to meet you guys.
I've heard so much about you.

943
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:51,536
How are you enjoying London,
Mickey?

944
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:54,775
It's one of the world's great
cities, you know, it really is.

945
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,344
And there's a lot of
opportunities here, too.

946
01:00:57,844 --> 01:01:00,981
Like with The Beatles
new record. You've heard it?

947
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:04,152
It's good.
It's very, very experimental.

948
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:06,988
And it's still number one
on the charts, you know?

949
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,490
That tells me that
there is an appetite out there.

950
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:12,793
For The Beatles?

951
01:01:13,427 --> 01:01:16,264
Well, for great artists
trying new things.

952
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:18,630
Like, I don't know you, Burt.
Judy says you're great.

953
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:20,432
These are just new ideas,
you know.

954
01:01:20,434 --> 01:01:22,566
But what if it's not
Judy and Burt?

955
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:26,137
What if it's... What if it's Judy
and The Rolling Stones?

956
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:28,206
- What is that?
- [laughs]

957
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,374
I don't know.
Maybe it's something, right?

958
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,313
Are you going to ask them
or should I?

959
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:37,315
Maybe somebody should.
That's all I'm saying for now.

960
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:40,619
That's the most
fascinating conjecture.

961
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:42,119
- Thank you.
- Don't you think?

962
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:43,190
Oh, absolutely.

963
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:45,893
Ha!

964
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,129
All right, yeah, cool.
Another round?

965
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:49,963
- [Burt] Yeah, great.
- Great.

966
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:52,900
[indistinct chatter]

967
01:01:58,972 --> 01:02:00,608
You don't think I could do it.

968
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:03,110
Well, I just...

969
01:02:04,143 --> 01:02:06,112
Well, I'm trying
to take the idea in.

970
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:08,882
Well, he thinks I could do it.

971
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:12,854
Isn't that sweet?

972
01:02:15,322 --> 01:02:16,688
[Mickey] Judy, what you having?

973
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,027
- Gin and tonic?
- [Judy] Yes. [laughs]

974
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:23,228
The studio portrayed you

975
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:27,365
as the sort of typical
American teenage girl next door.

976
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:29,070
Is that how you remember things?

977
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:31,471
Louis B. Mayer. [laughs]

978
01:02:31,938 --> 01:02:36,106
Oh, MGM put out all these
stories about how I ate pizza

979
01:02:36,108 --> 01:02:37,577
like any other girl.

980
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,612
They didn't let me have
any pizza at all.

981
01:02:40,614 --> 01:02:42,680
Every lunchtime for a year,

982
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:46,217
they had me eating
Louis B. Mayer's chicken soup

983
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:48,556
till I was thin enough
to play Dorothy.

984
01:02:49,088 --> 01:02:50,291
[audience laughs]

985
01:02:52,259 --> 01:02:56,130
[interviewer] The truth is,
those years left their mark,

986
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:58,132
- though, isn't it?
- [Judy] Oh, sure.

987
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:02,467
Hollywood's chicken population
never recovered.

988
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:03,702
[laughter]

989
01:03:03,704 --> 01:03:05,072
[interviewer] Very good.

990
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:08,576
But your childhood
at the studio,

991
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:12,079
it did lead to problems,
didn't it?

992
01:03:12,378 --> 01:03:17,050
Well, what matters to me now
is my children's happiness,

993
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,349
that's all.

994
01:03:18,351 --> 01:03:19,552
Are they here with you
in London?

995
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:21,722
They have school.

996
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,925
[interviewer] Well,
they must miss their mother.

997
01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:28,329
Hopefully they're having an
easier time of it than you had.

998
01:03:28,695 --> 01:03:29,931
Well, we all...

999
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:34,034
Everybody has their troubles,
and I've had mine.

1000
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:37,571
I've probably had everybody
else's too.

1001
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:41,675
[interviewer] Has it affected
your children, do you think?

1002
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:44,175
What?

1003
01:03:44,177 --> 01:03:45,479
The fights over custody.

1004
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:47,480
Your children
living away from you.

1005
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:51,182
I mean, if I'm this terrible
mother they like to write about,

1006
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:54,753
well, you tell me how I end up
with such incredible kids.

1007
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:57,088
But I wasn't suggesting...

1008
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:00,425
Well, no,
everybody suggests things,

1009
01:04:00,427 --> 01:04:05,195
like I'm not a real person,
but I am, you understand?

1010
01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:07,734
I'm only Judy Garland
for an hour a night.

1011
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:11,105
The rest of the time,
I'm part of a family.

1012
01:04:11,505 --> 01:04:13,541
I just want
what everybody wants.

1013
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:16,610
I seem to have a harder time
getting it.

1014
01:04:18,344 --> 01:04:19,980
[interviewer]
I didn't mean to upset you.

1015
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:21,615
Thank you.

1016
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:24,684
[Rosalyn] Have you seen Judy?

1017
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:31,822
Gill, you haven't seen Judy,

1018
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,059
- have you?
- No, I'm sorry.

1019
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:34,992
- Judy?
- [man over P.A.] <i>Miss Garland</i>

1020
01:04:34,994 --> 01:04:37,561
<i>to the stage, please.
Miss Garland.</i>

1021
01:04:37,563 --> 01:04:38,632
[Rosalyn sighs]

1022
01:04:44,471 --> 01:04:47,608
- [door opens, closes]
- Judy, it's twelve o'clock.

1023
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:49,242
And?

1024
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:51,578
And there's a thousand
people upstairs

1025
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:54,681
- waiting to hear you sing.
- So bring 'em another drink.

1026
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:56,684
And have 'em bring me one, too.

1027
01:04:57,818 --> 01:04:59,020
I know...

1028
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:03,656
- I know it's not easy.
- Oh, you do, do you?

1029
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:05,523
I mean, the shows

1030
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:07,528
- have been a huge success.
- So what?

1031
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:12,729
It doesn't change anything.
What difference does it make?

1032
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:13,733
[Rosalyn] Look.

1033
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:16,803
I'll do all I can to help you
resolve whatever's going on.

1034
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:22,742
But, please... for my sake,
just... Just... Just do the show.

1035
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:25,780
You're a classy little number,
aren't you?

1036
01:05:26,413 --> 01:05:28,748
Just get up and sing!

1037
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:32,550
You wanna serve me up to them
like I'm their goddamn dinner.

1038
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:34,619
Judy, I'm sorry, but that is not
what I'm trying to do.

1039
01:05:34,621 --> 01:05:36,456
- I'm trying to help you.
- Don't Judy me.

1040
01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:38,491
You're not my friend.

1041
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:43,329
You don't care about me.

1042
01:05:46,565 --> 01:05:48,432
[scoffs] Listen, it's fine.

1043
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:50,568
It's fine. We'll just
have Lonnie Donegan perform.

1044
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,202
Over my dead body!

1045
01:05:52,204 --> 01:05:54,741
- If you don't want to do it...
- It's my show.

1046
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:56,807
It's my name up there.

1047
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:00,346
No, Lonnie Donegan
is a peach of a man,

1048
01:06:01,148 --> 01:06:05,086
but he can go fuck himself if he
thinks he's having my billing.

1049
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:08,856
- She's upset.
- Yes, I gathered that.

1050
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:11,292
[music playing]

1051
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:13,359
Evening, Lonnie.

1052
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:16,730
[instrumental intro plays]

1053
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,300
No! No time for that, Burt.

1054
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,137
We've got a show to,
you know, put on.

1055
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:25,639
- [man] You're late.
- So what?

1056
01:06:25,871 --> 01:06:28,475
It's a party.
Where are you?

1057
01:06:29,476 --> 01:06:31,445
Oh! What, do you have to be home

1058
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:33,313
for your mommy
to put you to bed?

1059
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:34,848
Be a man,
have another drink.

1060
01:06:35,248 --> 01:06:36,813
- [laughter]
- Have one on me.

1061
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:38,650
He's gonna have one on me.

1062
01:06:38,652 --> 01:06:39,820
[scattered applause]

1063
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:42,556
- What you let her on stage for?
- [Judy] Wonderful to be here.

1064
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:43,757
There you go.

1065
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:45,492
Yeah.

1066
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:50,795
Is this... Is this Chicago?
What is it?

1067
01:06:50,797 --> 01:06:52,599
The set list says San Francisco.

1068
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,468
[booing]

1069
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:56,370
Chicago, San Francisco...

1070
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,771
What the hell town
are we in anyway?

1071
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,470
[laughter]

1072
01:07:00,472 --> 01:07:01,808
[man] Sing us a song.

1073
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,309
Is that you again? I thought you
were gonna have a drink.

1074
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:06,945
[man] You drank the bar dry.

1075
01:07:06,947 --> 01:07:08,548
- [laughter]
- [woman] Oh!

1076
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:15,588
Why did you just
spoil it for everyone?

1077
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:20,224
How am I supposed to do this
up here with you harassing me

1078
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:21,726
like that down there?
Why don't you

1079
01:07:21,728 --> 01:07:23,595
come up here
and you do the show?

1080
01:07:23,597 --> 01:07:26,563
And I'll take the chair
and do the fatuous backtalk,

1081
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:28,999
you goddamn fucking baboon!

1082
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:30,304
[microphone static]

1083
01:07:36,242 --> 01:07:37,945
[booing and whistling]

1084
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:44,251
[publicist] I want her changed
and ready in five minutes.

1085
01:07:46,385 --> 01:07:48,255
I'd like a moment with Judy.

1086
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:10,544
[Mayer sighs]

1087
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,248
[Judy] I had a swim.

1088
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:16,382
[Mayer] How was the water?

1089
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:19,687
Cold.

1090
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,922
[Mayer]
That's because it's a prop.

1091
01:08:22,454 --> 01:08:24,225
It's not meant to be enjoyed.

1092
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:27,961
I did 18 hours yesterday.

1093
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,365
I mean, I couldn't hardly
remember my own name.

1094
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:35,235
Your name is Frances Gumm.

1095
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:38,503
You're a fat-ankled,
snag-toothed rube

1096
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:40,304
from Grand Rapids.
Your father was a faggot,

1097
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,542
and your mother only cares
about what I think of you.

1098
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:46,713
Now, do you remember
who you are, Judy?

1099
01:08:49,548 --> 01:08:51,482
I'm sorry if I slowed things
down a little.

1100
01:08:51,484 --> 01:08:52,853
[Mayer] We like you loyal.

1101
01:08:54,354 --> 01:08:56,824
You're the best friend.
The girl next door.

1102
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,927
- You're faithful.
- I'm sorry.

1103
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:02,462
[Mayer]
You sing from the heart, Judy.

1104
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:05,865
You know where the heart is?

1105
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,338
It's there.

1106
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:16,741
Now, I want you
to look me in the eye

1107
01:09:16,743 --> 01:09:19,913
and tell me you remember
we made a deal.

1108
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,416
I know I did.

1109
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:25,586
You made that choice.

1110
01:09:26,586 --> 01:09:28,622
I was there.
I heard you make it.

1111
01:09:32,992 --> 01:09:33,994
I'm sorry.

1112
01:09:35,595 --> 01:09:37,829
You wanna go swimming,
you come over to my beach house.

1113
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:39,432
You can swim there all night.

1114
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:46,974
Now, say thank you.

1115
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:50,443
Thank you.

1116
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:55,449
Don't ever hold up
a movie of mine.

1117
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,328
[Mickey muffled]
You know what?

1118
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:10,997
You need your own place.

1119
01:10:12,097 --> 01:10:14,368
A club or something.
Someplace...

1120
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:17,837
people are gonna come to anyway
because it's a cool place.

1121
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:22,440
And if you sing, it's a goddamn
perfect miracle of a night.

1122
01:10:22,442 --> 01:10:25,645
And if you don't, it's no foul,
it was a good time.

1123
01:10:26,845 --> 01:10:28,881
People just wanna be around you.

1124
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:30,984
You have that.

1125
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:37,457
You know, I talk to people.
You don't hear it.

1126
01:10:37,923 --> 01:10:39,393
They all love you.

1127
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,096
I'm serious.
You don't see it.

1128
01:10:42,929 --> 01:10:44,728
People talk about
what's next for you

1129
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,532
because maybe they
could get in on it.

1130
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:48,668
Because you're a big deal.

1131
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,170
I... I have a perspective on this
that I think you don't.

1132
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:56,476
I see how great you are.
I don't see the problems.

1133
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:01,382
You'll get it perfect next time,
all right?

1134
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:05,452
Sweetheart?

1135
01:11:08,621 --> 01:11:09,890
You can't stay there forever.

1136
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:13,493
Sweetheart.

1137
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:17,663
I really feel just terrible

1138
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:19,964
about last night.

1139
01:11:19,966 --> 01:11:23,768
I sincerely believed that I was
coming down with something.

1140
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,706
And I took a syrup for the flu.

1141
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:28,741
And I was off with the fairies.
[laughs]

1142
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:31,512
And I just... I got so upset.

1143
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:37,884
And, Rosalyn, I wanna thank you
for... For looking after me.

1144
01:11:39,018 --> 01:11:40,020
Oh...

1145
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:45,125
If I'd have known
you were unwell,

1146
01:11:45,658 --> 01:11:47,528
I wouldn't have asked you
to sing.

1147
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:51,465
And the press
might've been more forgiving.

1148
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,501
But can you forgive me?

1149
01:11:58,570 --> 01:11:59,806
It's forgotten.

1150
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:02,576
The question is...

1151
01:12:04,077 --> 01:12:06,012
how are you feeling today?

1152
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:09,817
Well, as it happens,
I feel terrific.

1153
01:12:10,516 --> 01:12:13,519
We have a man
I'd encourage you to see.

1154
01:12:14,087 --> 01:12:16,590
He does vitamin injections.

1155
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,694
Whatever you'd like me to do.

1156
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:26,696
Right.
Would you sing for me,

1157
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:27,900
- please?
- Sing?

1158
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:30,237
[doctor] Any scale will do.

1159
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:32,605
[clears throat]

1160
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:37,144
[hums]

1161
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:40,480
- [Judy clears throat]
- Good, and up.

1162
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:49,122
[hums shakily]

1163
01:12:51,757 --> 01:12:53,059
[clears throat]

1164
01:12:56,162 --> 01:12:57,664
Right, well...

1165
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:00,701
it's not in a good way, is it?

1166
01:13:02,234 --> 01:13:03,733
[chuckles]

1167
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:05,538
Have there been any surgeries?

1168
01:13:06,605 --> 01:13:09,076
Tracheotomy.
Two years ago.

1169
01:13:11,144 --> 01:13:12,613
Tried to kill myself.

1170
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:14,948
That won't have
helped your voice.

1171
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,182
Hmm.

1172
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:20,287
Hepatitis as well.

1173
01:13:20,886 --> 01:13:23,023
Look, do you take anything
for depression?

1174
01:13:23,622 --> 01:13:25,057
Four husbands.

1175
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:29,029
Didn't work.

1176
01:13:30,128 --> 01:13:31,631
I'd say you're underweight.

1177
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:34,134
Well, you're flirting
with me now.

1178
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:38,302
Mr. Delfont asked me
to give you something,

1179
01:13:38,304 --> 01:13:39,907
so I'm going to give you

1180
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,940
a vitamin injection
and some anti-inflammatories

1181
01:13:42,942 --> 01:13:46,643
for your vocal cords.
What you really need is rest.

1182
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:47,648
Mm!

1183
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:49,950
At home, with my children.

1184
01:13:50,882 --> 01:13:53,686
- Precisely. With your feet up.
- Mm-hmm.

1185
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:04,730
[doctor] Good.

1186
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,234
Ooh! [chuckles]

1187
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:11,939
Do you know, I, uh...

1188
01:14:14,407 --> 01:14:17,610
I had an absolute thing
for Dorothy Gale.

1189
01:14:18,243 --> 01:14:19,313
My goodness.

1190
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:23,149
A lot of boys
liked her pigtails.

1191
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:24,417
Yeah. For me, it was...

1192
01:14:26,252 --> 01:14:28,789
It was more about
how she took care of her dog.

1193
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:34,694
You might be the most English
man I've ever met.

1194
01:14:37,029 --> 01:14:38,064
Judy...

1195
01:14:39,765 --> 01:14:41,934
you need to take better care
of yourself.

1196
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:44,770
You understand?

1197
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,309
- Do you understand?
- [Judy] Mm.

1198
01:15:04,756 --> 01:15:06,456
[Mickey] <i>So there's a guy
I mentioned.</i>

1199
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:07,693
[Judy] Mm-hmm.

1200
01:15:07,926 --> 01:15:09,427
Desperate to do a deal with you.

1201
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:10,831
- [Judy] Mm-hmm.
- [Mickey] Okay.

1202
01:15:12,032 --> 01:15:15,402
His thing is a chain of maybe
500 movie theaters, okay?

1203
01:15:16,135 --> 01:15:19,070
Each one is called
a Judy Garland Picture House.

1204
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:20,073
Every one?

1205
01:15:21,073 --> 01:15:23,175
All you gotta do for each one
is you open it,

1206
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:26,179
and you get 10% of sales.

1207
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:28,079
- Ten percent?
- Ten percent.

1208
01:15:28,081 --> 01:15:30,281
He tried to make it seven,
but I pushed him up.

1209
01:15:30,283 --> 01:15:32,083
And I don't have to
do anything else?

1210
01:15:32,085 --> 01:15:33,753
No touring, nothing.

1211
01:15:34,087 --> 01:15:37,891
You get to pay off your debts,
you buy that house,

1212
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:41,328
and you see your kids
every single day.

1213
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,163
- Mickey.
- You're free.

1214
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,263
Isn't that the greatest thing
you ever heard?

1215
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,201
Yes, it's the greatest thing.

1216
01:15:49,135 --> 01:15:50,671
Oh, darling.

1217
01:15:51,136 --> 01:15:53,139
- Good news, right?
- [chuckling] Yes.

1218
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:57,377
Yeah, just had to tell you that.

1219
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:01,881
This isn't so bad, is it?

1220
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:05,152
I mean, I know it's not family,
but...

1221
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:07,153
You're family.

1222
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,789
That's how I feel.

1223
01:16:11,356 --> 01:16:12,391
Yeah?

1224
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:16,129
I have an incredible feeling
about you, Mickey.

1225
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:18,398
Look what you're doing.

1226
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:20,834
Look how you take care of me.

1227
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,235
I mean, it's completely crazy,

1228
01:16:24,237 --> 01:16:26,038
- but...
- But it's very real.

1229
01:16:26,972 --> 01:16:28,240
Yeah, I know.

1230
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:29,775
I know.

1231
01:16:33,246 --> 01:16:34,780
Are you happy?

1232
01:16:36,114 --> 01:16:38,851
Yeah... I am.

1233
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:42,285
You and me.

1234
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:43,422
You and me.

1235
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,059
I want us to get married.

1236
01:16:48,493 --> 01:16:51,964
I feel like any moment
we're not married is wasted.

1237
01:16:53,131 --> 01:16:55,868
I mean, do you
remember Scotty Beckett?

1238
01:16:56,101 --> 01:16:59,436
He played my kid brother in
<i>Listen, Darling</i> in '37 or '38.

1239
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:02,473
He was the sweetest kid.
And last year, just like that,

1240
01:17:02,475 --> 01:17:04,044
he's dead from something
or other.

1241
01:17:04,277 --> 01:17:07,279
That and...
I'm happy with you.

1242
01:17:08,113 --> 01:17:10,216
And shouldn't we
grab hold of that?

1243
01:17:10,983 --> 01:17:12,085
[chuckles]

1244
01:17:13,286 --> 01:17:15,221
I... I'm here, aren't I?

1245
01:17:15,854 --> 01:17:17,321
That's a hell of an answer.

1246
01:17:17,323 --> 01:17:20,357
Sweetheart, I already said
I love you nine times today.

1247
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:22,262
Well, maybe I need ten,

1248
01:17:22,962 --> 01:17:26,099
or 12, once an hour,
like a cuckoo clock.

1249
01:17:26,431 --> 01:17:28,033
Cuckoo!
I love you!

1250
01:17:30,136 --> 01:17:31,235
Well?

1251
01:17:31,237 --> 01:17:33,172
[reporters yelling indistinctly]

1252
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:35,175
[cameras clicking]

1253
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:40,277
- [Mickey] Mm.
- [Judy laughs]

1254
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:41,879
To the happy couple.

1255
01:17:41,881 --> 01:17:43,450
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1256
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:48,355
[Rosalyn]
It's our present to you,

1257
01:17:48,554 --> 01:17:50,356
so you just trust me, okay?

1258
01:17:52,057 --> 01:17:53,891
Judy, Judy, you go to the front.

1259
01:17:53,893 --> 01:17:55,860
It's a surprise.
It's a surprise.

1260
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:57,797
Burt, are you ready?

1261
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:00,063
[Burt] I think the bloody
matches are damp.

1262
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:02,967
Matches?
I'm a little terrified.

1263
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,438
This way you can say you've had
an English church wedding.

1264
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:08,205

That's the way I do business.

[knocks]

[Sid] Hello, Judy.

1304
01:20:34,686 --> 01:20:35,654
Sid?

1305
01:20:36,154 --> 01:20:37,489
Got time for a drink?

1306
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:46,498
So I hear you got married again.

1307
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,402
- Congratulations.
- [Judy] Thank you.

1308
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,173
How have the shows been?

1309
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,042
They've been wonderful.
I'm a hit.

1310
01:20:57,743 --> 01:21:01,247
Well, maybe you'll make it
as a singer after all.

1311
01:21:02,347 --> 01:21:04,317
- I think I at least have a shot.
- Hmm.

1312
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:14,290
Who's looking after the kids?

1313
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,694
They're being looked after.

1314
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:18,097
By whom?

1315
01:21:18,564 --> 01:21:19,733
A maid?

1316
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:25,704
Maybe we, uh...

1317
01:21:27,706 --> 01:21:29,175
Maybe it's time we...

1318

- put all the lawyers aside.
- [scoffs]

1319
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:34,378
Can't afford them either, huh?

1320
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,050
You and I need to work out
what's best for the kids.

1321
01:21:37,248 --> 01:21:38,518
They need to know...

1322
01:21:39,318 --> 01:21:42,322
how their general
situation's gonna be.

1323
01:21:42,555 --> 01:21:44,758
- I'm coming back for them.
- The kids need a home.

1324
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,258
- I can give them that.
- I know what kids need.

1325
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,329
- They need their mother.
- They also need school,

1326
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:53,533
and friends
they can rely on seeing.

1327
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,301
No.

1328
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:56,767
- Come on.
- No, Sid.

1329
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:58,738
- Judy.
- No. No!

1330
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:02,339
I'm working harder
than you would ever believe.

1331
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:03,840
- Are you?
- And right now,

1332
01:22:03,842 --> 01:22:06,110
my husband is making
a deal for me

1333
01:22:06,112 --> 01:22:08,312
- that means I can start over.
- You're not listening.

1334
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:09,749
I have someone
I can rely on now.

1335
01:22:10,349 --> 01:22:11,748
Someone who's helping me
make money

1336
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,483
instead of losing it
at the track.

1337
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:15,755
- Can we not...
- I'm going to get a place.

1338
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:18,391
And they're going
to live with me.

1339
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:29,101
I don't want them
on stage with me,

1340
01:22:30,202 --> 01:22:33,236
I don't want them
in this phony business,

1341
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:37,176
and I don't want them anywhere
near the bastards who run it.

1342
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,250
But you have to let me be with
them, Sid.

1343
01:22:45,684 --> 01:22:47,420
I'm a good mother.

1344
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:56,429
I know you try.

1345
01:22:58,396 --> 01:23:01,501
That's a sneaky little jab
in the guts.

1346
01:23:03,702 --> 01:23:06,202
I know what a bad mother is.
I lived with one.

1347
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:08,507
They love you.
They do.

1348
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:11,511
They miss you,
and they wanna see you.

1349
01:23:12,578 --> 01:23:14,114
And they also wanna stay put.

1350
01:23:17,515 --> 01:23:18,650
That's what they want.

1351
01:23:19,251 --> 01:23:20,520
- That's the truth.
- Stay put?

1352
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:22,789
- That's what they told me.
- Stay put with you.

1353
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:25,325
- That's what they told me.
- I see.

1354
01:23:26,524 --> 01:23:28,560
And I'm just supposed
to take your word for it.

1355
01:23:30,261 --> 01:23:32,262
- What, you think I'm an idiot?
- Judy.

1356
01:23:32,264 --> 01:23:33,533
You think I'm an idiot?

1357
01:23:33,832 --> 01:23:35,799
Do you think I'd take your word
for anything,

1358
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:37,433
you lousy son of a bitch?

1359
01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:40,370
That my children would wanna
live anywhere that I'm not?

1360
01:23:40,372 --> 01:23:42,705
- Keep it down.
- It's not true!

1361
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:45,244
- Keep your voice down.
- It's not true!

1362
01:23:46,311 --> 01:23:48,814
I knew you were low,
but, Jesus, Sid.

1363
01:23:49,981 --> 01:23:51,184
No.

1364
01:23:51,716 --> 01:23:53,318
- Sit down.
- No.

1365
01:24:15,306 --> 01:24:16,309
Mickey?

1366
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:19,279
Hey.

1367
01:24:20,945 --> 01:24:23,914
- Thank God you're back.
- [Mickey chuckles]

1368
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,353
Never again. Do you hear me?
You can't leave me like that.

1369
01:24:27,586 --> 01:24:30,289
- All right
- [Judy] Did you miss me?

1370
01:24:30,555 --> 01:24:31,857
- Of course.
- Yeah?

1371
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:33,926
- I got you something.
- You did?

1372
01:24:34,592 --> 01:24:37,497
- No. [gasps]
- The shop didn't carry wrapping.

1373
01:24:38,296 --> 01:24:42,668
I love it. I love it.
Oh, darling, thank you.

1374
01:24:43,368 --> 01:24:44,503
Thank you.

1375
01:24:45,637 --> 01:24:46,902
What time is it?

1376
01:24:46,904 --> 01:24:48,774
- Uh...
- They'll be waiting for me.

1377
01:24:49,475 --> 01:24:51,611
Oh, the day I've had.

1378
01:24:51,844 --> 01:24:54,346
- [Mickey] What happened?
- [scoffs] I just...

1379
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:56,412
I need a drink.

1380
01:24:56,414 --> 01:24:58,217
- Would you mind?
- [Mickey] Of course.

1381
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:01,821
How was New York?
How'd it go?

1382
01:25:03,354 --> 01:25:05,755
You know, we need to send some
of the advance money

1383
01:25:05,757 --> 01:25:08,825
to my lawyer straight away.
I wanna reopen custody.

1384
01:25:08,827 --> 01:25:10,697
And I feel like, you know,
I should...

1385
01:25:10,895 --> 01:25:12,731
at least pay him something,
you know?

1386
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:15,635
Um... sweetheart?

1387
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:16,868
[Judy] <i>Yeah?</i>

1388
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,443
Yeah?

1389
01:25:26,011 --> 01:25:26,812
What's wrong?

1390
01:25:27,645 --> 01:25:30,649
It didn't, uh...
turn out like I wanted.

1391
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:32,719
What do you mean?

1392
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,421
The deal.

1393
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:38,524
It... It didn't work out.

1394
01:25:39,591 --> 01:25:41,361
- I don't understand.
- Yeah.

1395
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:43,826
You have to keep singing
for a while, I think.

1396
01:25:43,828 --> 01:25:45,728
You have more dates
at Talk of The Town.

1397
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:49,031
No, I can't keep touring.
I have to go home to my kids.

1398
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:51,470
I have to go home.
You promised.

1399
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:55,539
- I tried my best, Judy, okay?
- No, you promised.

1400
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,540
Look, I tried to make
something happen,

1401
01:25:57,542 --> 01:25:59,545
but they had other ideas,
all right?

1402
01:25:59,811 --> 01:26:01,814
- Why?
- Why?

1403
01:26:02,613 --> 01:26:05,350
- I don't know.
- Yeah, why? Why, Mickey?

1404
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:07,918
Showing up late,
cursing at the audience.

1405
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,719
Their wives read about that
in the papers.

1406
01:26:09,721 --> 01:26:10,756
They got cold feet.

1407
01:26:12,725 --> 01:26:14,727
So I messed it up?

1408
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,563
That's their opinion about it.
If you wanna know, yeah.

1409
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:21,430
And what's your opinion,
Mickey?

1410
01:26:21,432 --> 01:26:23,366
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

1411
01:26:23,368 --> 01:26:26,436
[stammering] I don't think
it's anybody's fault.

1412
01:26:26,438 --> 01:26:29,473
I think maybe I could've asked
more questions upfront.

1413
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:30,543
[Judy] Oh, my God.

1414
01:26:31,676 --> 01:26:32,944
Maybe you could have laid off
the stuff a little bit.

1415
01:26:33,412 --> 01:26:35,081
Oh, so you do think
it's my fault?

1416
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:37,813
- I didn't say that.
- You do.

1417
01:26:37,815 --> 01:26:39,918
- You think it's my fault.
- Of course it's your fault!

1418

[sighs]

1419
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:51,730
So, uh...

1420
01:26:53,564 --> 01:26:54,733
what is it...

1421
01:26:55,466 --> 01:26:58,937
What is that you do,
anyway, Mickey?

1422
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:01,708
What does that mean?

1423
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:06,446
You're just like
all the other ones.

1424
01:27:07,578 --> 01:27:10,580
You sit on the sidelines

1425
01:27:10,582 --> 01:27:12,648
and you watch the show,

1426
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,818
and you think that's making
things happen.

1427
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,658
You think that's working.

1428
01:27:19,591 --> 01:27:21,728
What have you ever done

1429
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:25,562

wanna listen to you?

You shouldn't have come
in the first place.

I'm not gonna be here

1435

- I don't care!

1559

- Hmm.

1561

I mean, you look at him now

1562
01:38:00,097 --> 01:38:03,132

bowling ball

1563
01:38:03,134 --> 01:38:04,536

But, uh...

1565
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:09,173
Oh, I was mad about him.

1566
01:38:10,774 --> 01:38:12,610
And he turned me down flat.

1567
01:38:13,177 --> 01:38:13,945
Hmm.

1568
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:17,315

1573
01:38:38,103 --> 01:38:41,140

1574
