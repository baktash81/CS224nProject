1
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,296
Bravo!

2
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,423
My name is Claude Eastman.

3
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,263
As you've probably guessed,
I'm a symphony conductor.

4
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:35,328
You may have heard of me.
I didn't always possess this uniform.

5
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:39,172
For 20-oddyears, I ate,
drank and dreamt music.

6
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:42,111
I became a... well,
what the hell, I'll say it...

7
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,911
Great conductor and,
simultaneously, a lonely man.

8
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,214
I wanted more.

9
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,585
- Love, probably.
- Bravo!

10
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:52,989
Be careful what you wish.
You just might get it.

11
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,893
I met her on tour, in Venice.
She was acting in a film.

12
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:58,625
We fell in love and married
almost immediately.

13
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,792
She made me young.
She gave me life.

14
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:03,303
It was...
It was great while it lasted.

15
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,863
But tonight, it will all
cease to exist for me.

16
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:12,108
Because tonight,
I'm going to... kill her.

17
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,949
My problem began four days ago.

18
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,488
I had just returned
from a concert in England.

19
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:22,788
Now arriving at gate 73.

20
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,368
There he is. Claude!

21
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,838
Hi! Oh, mm!

22
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,570
Oh! God.

23
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,603
Oh, I don't believe it. You look more
beautiful on Thursday than you did on Sunday.

24
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,616
I think you're
improving with age.

25
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,777
Why don't you ever say things
like that to me, Norman?

26
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,754
- Because she's nine years old.
- Oh.

27
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,486
- Hello, Claude.
- Oh, hi, Carla. How are you?

28
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,892
- I'm just wonderful.
- Did you think of me often?

29
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:55,953
Every night, as soon
as the girls left, I'd...

30
00:04:56,031 --> 00:05:00,401
- "Claude Eastman returns to his homeland in triumph."
- Hello, Norman. How are you?

31
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,597
- "Fine, thank you. Very well." That's Norman.
- This is wonderful.

32
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:04,607
Sold out Albert Hall.
Listen to this.

33
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:07,007
"A master of late romantic
repertoire."

34
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:13,283
Bene, bene. I want to get the luggage
before somebody steals it.

35
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,342
- All right.
- Give me the ticket.

36
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,354
- Thank you.
- That's it.

37
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:20,051
Get copies made of the London reviews.
Make sure that Paul sees this.

38
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:22,560
- This is very, very important.
- Norman and that machine are joined at the lip.

39
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:25,223
- I know.
- Listen, this is gonna help the BBC interview.

40
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,233
Interview?

41
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:30,896
Oh, my dear, I was supposed to do the Time
interview with jerzy for the movie.

42
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:35,204
- When?
- Now. Carla, come with me. I have to call. I've missed it.

43
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:37,870
- Don't worry about it. He'll think it's very Italian.
- Yes.

44
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,472
He'll kill me. Come on.

45
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,784
She is cute.

46
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:47,756
They're all cute the first year.

47
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:54,454
- Aha.
- What?

48
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,466
- Your eyelid fluttered.
- Fluttered?

49
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:59,025
You're doing too much.
You're wearing yourself thin.

50
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,698
And you're losing all perspective.

51
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:05,072
- This marriage to Daniella...
- Oh, Norman. Not again.

52
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:07,203
- Look, maybe we're overbooking you.
- Well, you're not!

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,545
Well, two concerts a week.
Scoring Daniella's movie.

54
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:13,678
You marry a very beautiful woman...

55
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,722
A very much younger...

56
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,780
Very much younger.
Half your age.

57
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:20,486
- And I'm being kind.
- So, what are you saying?

58
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:22,496
I'm saying it's affecting you.

59
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,862
You go out of town
for three days...

60
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:27,401
and you're this jealous?

61
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,267
Jealous?
Jealous of what?

62
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:31,898
It's none of my business,
but having me hire a private eye...

63
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,775
to watch your wife while you're out
of town is not my idea of complete trust.

64
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:38,007
What are you talking about?
Private eye?

65
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:41,107
- Private eye. A detective.
- What detective?

66
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:44,643
Giuseppe told me you wanted to hire a detective
to watch Daniella while you were gone.

67
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,656
- This was my instructions.
- Giuseppe?

68
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:48,716
- Yes.
- My Giuseppe? This Giuseppe here?

69
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,728
Of course!

70
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:53,287
Hire a private eye?
What...

71
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,460
Oh! That's not what I said.

72
00:06:56,536 --> 00:07:01,064
I told him to tell you to keep an eye
on Daniella while I was gone.

73
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:03,201
Take her to a movie. Take her to dinner.
Make sure she wasn't lonely.

74
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:06,542
- Keep an eye on her!
- He told me to hire a private eye.

75
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,548
- Didn't I tell you that couldn't be right?
- Oh. That was...

76
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,710
- I told you it couldn't be right. He doesn't know what I'm talking about.
- You see this?

77
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:14,153
An eye. "Keep an eye" on her.

78
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:16,589
- We had this discussion, didn't we, Giuseppe?
- Okay. An eye.

79
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,593
I said, "Detective?'"
You said, “Yes. '"

80
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:21,653
An eye. Keep an eye on her.
Occhio. Occhio.

81
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,762
I said, “A detective??' You said yes.
You don't know what a detective is.

82
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,244
What does a "detective" mean?

83
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,780
Why don't you carry a dictionary then?

84
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,783
Hold it!

85
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,785
- Si, si, si.
- Forget it.

86
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:43,879
- Forget it? Does Daniella know anything about this?
- Of course not.

87
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:46,517
I'm not gonna tell her. The private eye
won't tell her. He's a private eye.

88
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:48,584
- Make sure that Dan...
- What's the matter?

89
00:07:48,662 --> 00:07:51,530
Oh.

90
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,533
Just a typical booking
misunderstanding.

91
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:58,334
- How was your call? Was jerzy mad?
- Jerzy was very angry with me.

92
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:02,036
- What's going on here, dear?
- Unimportant. I don't even remember.

93
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,816
All right. I'll park the car
and then I'll bring out the luggage.

94
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,875
Eh? Signora.

95
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:13,046
Whoops!

96
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,820
- Mr. Eastman. Nice to have you back.
- Thanks, Eddie.

97
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:18,088
- Come sta?
- Bene.

98
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:21,564
- Broken again?
- Yeah. Now they're wiring it for sound.

99
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,659
- Oh, good. We can get mugged in stereo now.
- Modern technology.

100
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,706
- Yeah.
- Could have hired 10 doormen for what this thing cost.

101
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,208
- Well, at least we don't have to tip the machine at Christmas.
- Right.

102
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,111
Funny guy.

103
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,812
When I met the queen, I didn't know
whether to kneel, bow or curtsy.

104
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,881
- What did you do?
- Ah.

105
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,417
I knelt, Your Majesty.

106
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:50,659
- You did not!
- Marrone!

107
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:55,330
Oh, I'm unhappy. I've done nothing but cook
and eat since you've been gone.

108
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:58,272
- I gained three pounds.
- Three pounds!

109
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,138
How disgusting! Where are they?
I want to eat every...

110
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,840
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Now I've got you.

111
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,213
I'm going to eat
every one, individually.

112
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,518
- What's that?
- What? Oh!

113
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,616
Norman said to put it
where you wouldn't miss it.

114
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,958
You have rehearsal
with Max at 9:.00 a.m.

115
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,898
Don't be late, huh?
The two of you look so handsome.

116
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,698
Oh, take it down.
I don't want to see it.

117
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,535
- Why not?
- Because!

118
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,406
That man is keeping us apart.

119
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,674
Wha... What do you mean?

120
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:41,314
I love Max, but tomorrow morning I want
to be in a warm bed with you...

121
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,485
not in a... cold rehearsal studio
with him.

122
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:51,631
The maestro and his young protégé.

123
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:55,696
Hmm. Daniella.

124
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,470
You know what I said about
you improving with age?

125
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:00,478
- Do you think that's true of me?
- Of cou...

126
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,537
I mean, do you... Are you...

127
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,847
No. Are you gonna miss...

128
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,013
Um... younger men?

129
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,389
- The truth?
- No!

130
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,724
What a question.

131
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,593
Younger men are like
fast food restaurant, you know?

132
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,794
- It's quick, but not all that good.
- Oh, well.

133
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,963
But with you, it's like dining...

134
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,441
at the most wonderful,
expensive restaurant in the world.

135
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,879
Of course, the service
may be a little slow.

136
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,508
Yeah, but...

137
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,315
[ Violin, Piano ]

138
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:17,499
Great.

139
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,501
- That's great!
- Well, it was all right.

140
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,505
Come on. It's great.

141
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,768
Lovely. Really.
Listen, what about here?

142
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,776
Do you want that a little...
A little broader?

143
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:31,282
- - A little more rallentando
here, 'cause it needs the time.

144
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,284
And just keep this steady,
because I want to lay this in more.

145
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,287
- Very strict. Okay.
- Yeah.

146
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:39,382
- Okay.
- We did it that way in Vienna last spring. It works well.

147
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,294
Claude, you have rehearsal in half an hour.
And Giuseppe's here for your haircut.

148
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,525
- Oh, okay.
- By the way, congratulations.

149
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:48,568
- What?
- Your child bride. She's, uh... She's outrageous.

150
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,832
- What, you met her already?
- What?

151
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,930
- You met her already?
- No. No, I didn't meet her.

152
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,909
I, uh...
I saw one of her movies, in Venice.

153
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:58,003
- About, uh, two weeks ago.
- Terrific!

154
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,310
Yeah. She's...
She's real nice.

155
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,582
Coming from you, Max,
I feel I've done something right at last.

156
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,783
- Well, you have.
- Well, I'll rehearse with the orchestra this morning.

157
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:09,792
- I'll see you this afternoon.
- Okay.

158
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,852
Okay.

159
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,174
- 2:00, Steve Weintraub, pianist.
- Right.

160
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,511
- 2:45, violinist Leonard Bragg.
- Hold it. Hold it.

161
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,485
.00, Norman...
- One week from tonight, we find out about China.

162
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:36,182
Norman, I told you, I don't want to
even consider China right now...

163
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,192
Giuseppe, you're gonna
make a hole back there.

164
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,252
What, are you shrugging Off a continent?
There's 800 million people there.

165
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,730
- I know.
- If they hate you, 200 million people come by accident.

166
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,734
They're looking for a restaurant.

167
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:49,738
Isaac Stern didn't want to go.
What happened? Academy Award.

168
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:53,004
- Claude, the programs are being printed next week.
- What?

169
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:55,307
Somebody said you're substituting
another piece for the Mozart.

170
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,007
- I haven't made a decision yet.
- Go with Rossini or Verdi.

171
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:00,210
- Giuseppe, cut the hair.
- The printer's ready to kill me.

172
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:02,776
- I know.
- Help him out, will you? Look at him.

173
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:04,788
We have to have something to put on there.
All we have is the name of the concert hall.

174
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:08,588
Then the programs are blank. We'll give the
audience a pen. They can fill in their own.

175
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,095
- How about that charity luncheon next week?
- No! No, no.

176
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,257
- I've already said no.
- This is wrong here. Here. Just a minute.

177
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,894
- Change the hotel in Chicago.
- .00.

178
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,336
Nice place in Mexico City.
Giuseppe, do me a favor, will you?

179
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:21,773
When you're through, call my office.
I want to get a little clip, okay?

180
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,505
I work for Claude.
There's a barber downstairs.

181
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,809
Even the president's barber
cuts other people's hair.

182
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:29,874
- Girls, girls.
- All right, Claude, you can try now.

183
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:31,886
- Looks good, Claude.
- Yeah?

184
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,583
- Come va? Bene?
-

185
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:36,591
- Great. Thanks, Giuseppe.
- Si, si.

186
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,457
- Claude...
- No, Bill. Really. Okay?

187
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,322
I've got something here
for Norman Robbins.

188
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,984
- His secretary said he'd be here.
- Okay. Leave it.

189
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,961
- Uh-uh. My hands to his.
- Sign the register.

190
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:15,061
-
- Is that Leonard Bernstein's signature?

191
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:19,005
Uh-uh. Larry Bernstein.
Piccolo player.

192
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:50,371
What are you talking about?
What news?

193
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:53,106
Well, I think there's something here...

194
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,876
that Mr. Eastman
should take a look at.

195
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,545
Really? There is? What?

196
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,554
Oh, give me a hint!

197
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:03,648
I'm not at liberty to divulge
information to non-principals.

198
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:06,718
- I understand. What is it?
- Let's just say it's pretty heavy.

199
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:12,133
- You've gotta be kidding!
- In my business, that's the last thing we kid about.

200
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,933
Uh, the envelope is sealed.

201
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:23,347
I'm sure it is. I wasn't even looking at
the envelope. I was looking at the light.

202
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:32,013
Okay. Thank you. Very good.

203
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,787
Give your résumés to the janitor.
He'll know what to do with them.

204
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,836
Excuse me, Virginia.
Can I borrow Max a moment?

205
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,604
- Max, can I... Do you mind?
- I'll call you later.

206
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:55,639
Max, I think you must
walk around in a constant state of heat.

207
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:58,914
- It's a good thing you don't play the cello.
- The woman is an animal.

208
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:01,115
Yeah. She's also married
to one of our patron saints.

209
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,124
I mean, don't get
your fingerprints on her.

210
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:05,126
- You're so virtuous in your old age.
- I'm not!

211
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:07,594
- Did you ever notice the legs on her? And what about the mouth?
- No.

212
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,598
- Claude, the mouth.
- No, never.

213
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:15,037
- Mm. The breasts.
- Those are... terrific!

214
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:18,234
Claude. It's cold weather coat.

215
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,504
Okay. Thank you, Mama.

216
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,513
- See you later, Norman.
- Wait a second.

217
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,515
- Can I walk with you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,051
- Gotta buy a gift for Daniella.
- I thought you were having lunch with her.

219
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,089
- She canceled. She's doing some looping for a film.
- All right. Well, let's go.

220
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,591
- Okay.
- Uh, we'll talk later.

221
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,650
Nice to meet you.

222
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,255
That's nice.

223
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,735
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- How about these?

224
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,796
Well.

225
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,709
- Oh.
- Mm.

226
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,906
Hi.

227
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,146
- What do you think?
- Oh. Is it for you?

228
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,154
- Yes.
- You promised me!

229
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:00,816
- Don't lie to me.
- No, it's for my wife, actually.

230
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:04,123
I'm a little too delicate for these.

231
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:07,029
Uh, how about a nice
Halloween gift?

232
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:10,534
- These gold pumpkins are cute.
- Oh, yeah.

233
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,696
When did Halloween become
gift-orientated? Isn't it just chocolate?

234
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,468
No, that's nice, Norman. Come on.
You could get Carla one of these.

235
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,000
- They're very pretty.
- Carla has every single thing in this store.

236
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,673
She lives here. She gets mail here.
Her parents stay here at Thanksgiving.

237
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,682
Really. Come on.

238
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,981
- What's the hurry?
- Please. I'm just nervous.

239
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,988
This is where she puts it all together.
You know what I'm saying.

240
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:31,150
I don't mind flying. I don't have to watch
the plane being built.

241
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:33,218
- Come on. Please.
- I'll take it.

242
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:37,923
Think that salesgirl was comin' on
to you a little bit.

243
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,935
Oh, yeah, you think so?

244
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:43,769
- She was nice.
- Do you ever think about screwing around anymore?

245
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,106
Me? No, not now.
Never.

246
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:50,875
Well, I mean, don't you ever fantasize
if a beautiful girl comes in to audition...

247
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:54,851
or a waitress with a great ass
brings you a cup of coffee?

248
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,913
Well, I must admit, I always
enjoy a great... cup of coffee.

249
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:02,018
But no, I mean...

250
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:05,155
Daniella, that's it.
I'm a happily married man, Norman.

251
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:08,292
- You know?
- Think Daniella ever thinks about screwing around?

252
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:11,770
Daniella? No, never.

253
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,570
If she sees a good-looking
younger man, she might...

254
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:17,510
What do you mean, "good-looking
younger man"? I'm not in the grave! God.

255
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:20,013
All right, all right. Forget
"good-looking younger man."

256
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:23,848
- But hypothetically, what if she was having an affair?
- Not Daniella. No, no.

257
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,153
Forget Daniella. But say hypothetically
you're married to a beautiful young woman.

258
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,489
- And she's having an affair.
- Not Daniella.

259
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,029
No, no, no, no, no.
Not Daniella. Daniella's out.

260
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,429
This is a new woman.
Hypothetical. She's having an affair.

261
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,594
- Would you want to know?
- Norman, are you trying to tell me something?

262
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,539
Because the hair on the back
of my neck's starting to creep.

263
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,304
Listen, I'm sorry I ever used Daniella.
The woman's nuts about you.

264
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:47,675
She's crazy. I've never seen
a woman so much in love.

265
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:50,477
It's just a question. I was at a party,
they asked this question.

266
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,316
“You're married to a beautiful woman, she's
having an affair... would you want to know??'

267
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:58,449
Boy, this is...
This is really charming, Norman. I...

268
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:02,759
I'm... Hypothetically, no, because,
if-if she was, then I'd want to know who...

269
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:05,527
and when and where, and... oh.

270
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,831
- No, I wouldn't. Would you want to know?
- No, no, no.

271
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,566
I think there are things in life
that are better left unknown.

272
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,574
- What's that?
- What?

273
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,167
- You just dropped this. Did you mean to drop this?
- I dropped nothing.

274
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:18,305
You just dropped this envelope in here.
Did you mean to drop it?

275
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:21,351
I dropped... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this, yes.
What? Oh, it's a report.

276
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,352
- I threw it away. It's nothing.
- What report?

277
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:26,515
The mix-up with Giuseppe. The investigator.
This is his report. I threw it away.

278
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,389
- That's it?
- Yeah. Yeah, no. No! No, no, no, no.

279
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,226
- Norman. Come on!
- You said you didn't want to know.

280
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,892
- That was hypothetically!
- You said you didn't want to know. Oh, come on.

281
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,426
- Come on.
- Come on. Don't. What are you doing?

282
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,439
- What do you think I'm doing?
- You're not gonna read that?

283
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:43,340
No, I'm not gonna read it. If I was the
sort of person who'd read that report...

284
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,404
I'd be the sort of person who'd have my wife
followed by a detective in the first place.

285
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,848
You're an amazing man.
That's wonderful!

286
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:53,149
That's wonderful! Oh.
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

287
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,156
- No, I'm gonna walk. I need the exercise.
- Come on!

288
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:57,624
No, Daniella's spaghetti
is accumulating around my knees.

289
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:00,561
- Hey. That's an inspiration.
- It is!

290
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,757
- I've never seen anybody do that.
- That's wonderful.

291
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:05,130
- Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Uh... Yeah.

292
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,980
- Oh, Mr. Eastman!
- Oh! Hi, how are you? Nice to see you.

293
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:41,109
Don't you dare.
What if people would see us?

294
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:55,454
Carla, I feel so guilty about
the other night, I don't know what to do.

295
00:20:55,526 --> 00:20:57,994
Well, you can't tell Claude
what happened. He'll go crazy.

296
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:00,030
- But it's not fair to Claude!
- Mrs. Robbins, do you mind?

297
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:03,091
- I've got a film to finish. Thank you.
- Okay.

298
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:05,796
- I'm... I'm leaving.
- Have a nice day, now. Thank you very much.

299
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:07,805
Thank you.

300
00:21:07,873 --> 00:21:11,935
I haven't done any shopping in three hours,
and I wouldn't want to hurt the economy.

301
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:14,002
What is that?
A laughing apple?

302
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,278
No. It's a little solid-gold pumpkin...

303
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,717
that Norman doesn't know
he bought for me... it's for Halloween.

304
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:23,087
- Mrs. Robbins, please!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

305
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,353
- And listen, don't forget.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, go.

306
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:28,828
- Just go.
- Could we get one down? It's only four lines.

307
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:32,231
Uh, yes. Shh. I'm here.
All laughing, happy!

308
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,738
Claude? Darling, are you home?

309
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:50,983
- Hi!
- Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

310
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:55,584
Oh, you weren't interrupting. I was...
I was just, uh, working on the score.

311
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,790
- You want to hear some of it?
- Oh, yes. Sure.

312
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:00,799
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

313
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:04,497
Mm. I feel wonderful.

314
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:06,506
Okay. Well, I'll, um...

315
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:09,543
I'll play it from where you come in through the
door, where the theme begins. There you are.

316
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,359
- My God.
- Then you run to him. High strings.

317
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,555
Now the rest of the strings.

318
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:36,370
- Horn.
-

319
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:40,071
-
- That'll be your close-up.

320
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:46,648
And so on.

321
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,779
- Wonderful!
- No, you're wonderful.

322
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:50,847
- That's why.
- Wonderful! Mm.

323
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:52,915
How did the looping go?
All right?

324
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:57,397
Mm, fine. No problem.
Except I'm all laughed out.

325
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:01,334
Oh. Well, for somebody
who's all laughed out...

326
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:03,871
I think a little present
should be forthcoming.

327
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:06,169
Ohh!

328
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:13,781
- A... A pumpkin pin?
- Yeah.

329
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,584
Oh, that's beautiful. It's so delicate. I...

330
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,590
- Um, uh...
- What?

331
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:23,492
- I will wear it for, um...
- Halloween.

332
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:25,496
- "Halloween."
- Yeah, I can take it back if you don't want it.

333
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:27,498
- No, no, no, no, no! I love it.
- You like it?

334
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:30,001
I love it.

335
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:39,541
Hey, Giuseppe,
stop reading my trash.

336
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,014
- I don't read. I look.
- Well, don't look.

337
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,314
You tell me always, look, in case
you throw out some piece music.

338
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:47,878
Well, look, but don't look.

339
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:53,457
Ah!

340
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:56,863
Now I go, but I don't go.
I walk, but I don't walk.

341
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:59,198
I cook, but I don't cook.

342
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:02,705
- Hey, where are you going?
- Wait a minute.

343
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:05,334
Where are you going?

344
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,277
I'm going to have a little nap
before dinner. Will you come with me?

345
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,407
No, I've got some work to do.
You go ahead. Okay? Sleep well.

346
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,883
- Mm. All right.
- Okay.

347
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,478
The sleep of the innocent, huh?

348
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,992
- Why do you say that?
- Say what?

349
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,658
- "The sleep of the innocent."
- Uh, my mama used to say that when I was a child.

350
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,065
Oh.

351
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,248
- Where's the trash?
- In the squeeze machine.

352
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:43,080
In the compactor?

353
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,057
[ "La Donna É Mobile'" Continues ]

354
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,928
What you got in here?

355
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,592
There.

356
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:03,197
Uh, you look for any special garbage?

357
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:05,368
- Eggshells?
- No.

358
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:06,878
- Coffee grounds?
- No.

359
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:09,780
- Banana peels?
- No.

360
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,130
Yeah.

361
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,934
- Oh! Hi, Norman. Working late?
- Yeah, I had a million things to do.

362
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,237
- How'd you know I was here?
- Oh, I just took a chance.

363
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:43,821
The report, Norman. The report.
I can't read the name of the detective.

364
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:47,723
You went back to get the report? Claude,
look. You told me you weren't interested.

365
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:49,728
I... I'm not.

366
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:51,991
I'm not!

367
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:56,935
But, uh... You know, a lot of people make
an absolute killing in celebrity garbage.

368
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:15,381
Well, Mr. Keller...

369
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,394
the only assistance I need
is for you to give me...

370
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:21,192
any other copies of the report,
so that I can destroy them...

371
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:24,257
as I did the one
you gave Mr. Robbins.

372
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,202
- You destroyed the report?
- Yes. Oh, yes.

373
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:29,866
Y-You did read it?

374
00:26:29,942 --> 00:26:33,173
I don't know what sort of people
you're used to dealing with here...

375
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:36,214
but I-I do not have...

376
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:39,012
a suspicious bone in my body.

377
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:42,020
You don't know about the man
leaving your apartment at 1:30?

378
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:46,091
30?
What's so unusual about that?

379
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,187
1:30 in the morning?

380
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,199
Maybe it was a repairman.
I mean, uh...

381
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:56,533
God! Uh, things break
at night, don't they?

382
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:59,666
- Mr. Eastman, let me be honest with you.
- No.

383
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:02,074
In my business, the only thing that
gets broken in the middle of the night...

384
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:04,671
are the hearts of older men like us.

385
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,682
It's downright tragic.

386
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,980
We fall for these
beautiful, young things...

387
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:11,077
and we try to believe
they're in love with us...

388
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:14,853
when every morning, our shaving mirror
yells, "They can't be."

389
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:18,089
If I could just have the other reports,
it'd be fine.

390
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:22,292
Oh. Oh.

391
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:26,170
Very wise.

392
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:29,141
I only wish I'd been so wise.

393
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:33,579
You know, Mr. Eastman,
if I had it to do over again...

394
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:37,015
I wouldn't try to find out anything.

395
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:41,249
I'd just be grateful for whatever
she was willing to give me.

396
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:44,258
A year. A week.

397
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:46,317
An hour...
Oh! Here we are.

398
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:51,398
Actually, there was not much need
at all to hire me in the first place...

399
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:54,631
what with that fancy surveillance system
you have in your building.

400
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:58,937
Anybody steps into the hallway,
it automatically turns on the videotape.

401
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,843
Wait a minute. Are you saying there's
a tape of a man leaving my apartment?

402
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,881
Sure! I got it all here.

403
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,816
The coming in, and the going out.

404
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,877
Don't you worry, Mr. Eastman.

405
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,685
I'll erase the tape,
and you destroy the report...

406
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,989
and as far as the two of us
are concerned, it never happened.

407
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:18,930
Well, that's really very reassuring.
Thank you very much.

408
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:23,494
I certainly hope that you're continuing
that Haydn series next season.

409
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,664
Yes, we are. Yes.
It was very successful.

410
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,505
- That makes me very happy.
- Yeah.

411
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:32,013
Um, was there...
Is there an outstanding account at all?

412
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,572
No, no, no!
Mr. Robbins took care of everything.

413
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,484
- That includes the... the tape.
- Oh, including the tape.

414
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:41,513
Yes. Good. Well,
we're all settled then. Fine.

415
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,583
Thanks very much.

416
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:47,354
Good-bye.

417
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:10,380
Whenever you're ready, Mr. Eastman.

418
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:26,067
- You knew.
- Uh-huh.

419
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,908
I knew it. That's nothing!

420
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:38,114
That's Giuseppe.
That's the man who works for me.

421
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:40,454
No, no, no. That was at 8:30.
Look at the printout.

422
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:43,586
Any movement in the hallway
starts the tape machine automatically.

423
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,925
There he is.

424
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:52,529
I can't see who it is.
Is that all you have?

425
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:54,540
Hold on a minute there.
Now, just wait a minute.

426
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:56,872
It's not my equipment that screwed up.
Your building's tape machine...

427
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,935
- God!
- Right there!

428
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:00,709
- What, there? Wh-What?
- Let me punch in.

429
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,423
What?

430
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:11,483
Well, at least you know it's a guy
who wears argyle socks.

431
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:15,688
Who wears argyle socks?

432
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,424
You seemed very preoccupied.

433
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:42,827
What?

434
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:46,526
I said you seemed very...
Oh, my God.

435
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,661
- What?
- Don't look. There's a woman... Don't look! Don't...

436
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:51,001
Wait. There's a woman
at the bar in blue.

437
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:54,042
I've never seen a body like that.
Look very carefully. Now. Quickly. Quickly.

438
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:56,874
Oh, geez. Oh, my goodness.

439
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:59,915
Look at the body...

440
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,147
- I had no idea you had such a roving eye.
- I don't have a roving eye.

441
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,054
If a woman like that walks into your
field of vision, you look at her... come on.

442
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:09,525
I'm not a saint, Claude.

443
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:22,466
What are you doing?

444
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:25,740
- I dropped my fork.
- No, you didn't. You held it over and threw it down there.

445
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:28,148
- Where are you going? Where are you going?
- I'm just getting the fork.

446
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:30,580
- Don't. Don't!
- Where's Mr. Eastman?

447
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:32,585
Uh, he's under the table for a moment.

448
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:35,417
Claude, the waiter's here.

449
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:40,155
Shall I serve it down here,
or are you coming up?

450
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,502
Thank you, number six.
Number seven, please.

451
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:59,407
- Guess who.
- Oh!

452
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,044
- Hello, Daniella.
- How did you know it was me?

453
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,054
Oregano.
You've been cooking again.

454
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:10,027
I know I was supposed to wait for you, but
do you mind if I go home and take a nap?

455
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,326
Oh!

456
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,803
Another sleep of the innocent?

457
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:21,831
Go ahead. We're running late with
auditions. I'll phone you in an hour.

458
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:26,039
N-No! Don't phone.
I mean, don't phone. I'm tired.

459
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:29,379
- I'm taking the phone off the hook.
- Right.

460
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,385
You've been taking
a lot of naps recently.

461
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:34,912
Mm. In Italy, we do it
all the time after lunch.

462
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:37,459
I'm sure you do.
I'm sure you do.

463
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:48,200
I love my pumpkin, Claude.

464
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:52,437
- Thank you.
-

465
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,145
God...

466
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:05,252
Thank you, number seven.
Number eight, please.

467
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,164
- Happy, darlin'?
- Oh! Hi. Desperately, of course.

468
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:13,359
Hi, janet. Bill.

469
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:16,370
- Hey, listen. Don't be late tonight.
- Tonight? Why?

470
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:19,066
I get to meet Daniella tonight. You're
comin' to my old man's restaurant, right?

471
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:22,202
Oh, no. I forgot. I made a date
with Norman and Carla tonight.

472
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,270
- I-I better cancel.
- Bring 'em.

473
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:26,474
- That's four of us.
- No, no. It's all right. Bring 'em.

474
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,041
- You're still paying?
- Yeah.

475
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,112
Okay. Great.

476
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:34,157
- What are you doing this afternoon?
- I got a matinee.

477
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:37,718
- You're performing this afternoon?
- I got a matinee.

478
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:41,288
-
- Oh! A matinee.

479
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,358
Mm-hmm.

480
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:47,629
I'll see you later.
I gotta get to the hotel.

481
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:50,776
Claude?
What do you think?

482
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:53,005
I think he should be castrated.

483
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,708
- Claude. I don't think he's that bad.
- Oh?

484
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:55,109
Claude. Are you okay?

485
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:57,209
- What?
- Are you all right?

486
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:59,277
- Yeah!
- Good.

487
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:01,847
- Chilly out, huh?
- Brutal.

488
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:07,261
It's a... closet.

489
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:09,493
Yes. Big one.

490
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:12,365
What... What brings you over?

491
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:14,736
- What?
- What brings you over here?

492
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:16,741
Ah... I've wanted to...

493
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:20,006
I've wanted to talk to you about that...
You know, bar 34 in the first movement.

494
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,947
- The tempo.
- You want to broaden it. I think we should push straight through.

495
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:26,417
I'm... I... Let's do it. I'm takin' a shower.
I got the water running in there.

496
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:28,512
- No, I don't hear the water.
- It's a relatively quiet shower.

497
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,580
- Yeah?
- Be right back!

498
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:59,914
Slut!

499
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,982
I thought you were my wife.
Sorry.

500
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,155
She said she was going home
and take a nap, so...

501
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,665
That's real strange.

502
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,448
I wonder if he heard us.

503
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:23,075
He knows. I know he knows.

504
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:27,378
1009 Park Avenue. Quick.

505
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:46,246
- Daniella?
- Oh. Sweetheart?

506
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:48,909
Yeah. How was your "nap"?

507
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:51,453
Oh, wonderful. I can't tell you.

508
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:54,183
A few hours on my back
and I'm a new woman.

509
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:56,487
God... damn it!

510
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,461
What was that? Claude?

511
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,828
- Nothing. Ow. Shit.
- What?

512
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:05,097
Nothing. Nothing! Listen.

513
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,037
I think there's something we should talk
about right now.

514
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:12,742
- What's wrong? You sound so angry.
- Well, I am angry.

515
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:14,973
I am angry.

516
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,746
I'm angrier than I've... Oh.

517
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:22,255
- Than I've ever been before.
- Ooh.

518
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:26,453
- It's not because I broke our lunch date, is it?
- No, it's not.

519
00:39:26,528 --> 00:39:28,462
- It's becau...
- Why?

520
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,521
- Hmm?
- It's beca...

521
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,163
It's... Aah!

522
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,705
- You put your tongue in my ear.
- So?

523
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,072
Ah, so, who taught you that?
You've never done that before.

524
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,077
Of course I've done that before.

525
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:45,546
Are you trying to tell me that I wouldn't
know when a tongue is in my ea...

526
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,550
- No. No.
- Come on. Ohh!

527
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,882
I don't feel like it.

528
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,923
- It feels to me like you feel like it.
- I don't.

529
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,152
I'm very... I'm very...

530
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,128
angry with you, and...
And I want to ask you something.

531
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:00,131
What?

532
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,134
- Ask me anything.
- I... Oh, my God.

533
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:06,263
- What do you want to ask me?
- Oh, God.

534
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,145
Oh, Norman!

535
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:18,152
- Norman?
- Yeah.

536
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,486
Norman?
Don't you mean Max, Daniella?

537
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:26,392
No, it wasn't Max. Don't you remember, we have
to have dinner with Norman and Carla tonight?

538
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:29,125
- Oh, we're late. Quickly!
- What?

539
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,691
Oh. I have to dry
my hair and dress.

540
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:13,206
- Claude, you married the Madonna!
- Daniella, this is Max.

541
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:16,218
- I've heard so much about you, I feel I already know you.
- Max!

542
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:21,122
Well, I feel the same. I've heard you
on the record, of course, many times.

543
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:24,184
But I'm told you're
better in the flesh, you know?

544
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:27,197
Oh, well. You know, Claude thinks
I'm too much of a showman, you know.

545
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:29,256
He says I don't concentrate
on my technique.

546
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:31,326
Listen, tonight,
in your honor, if I play...

547
00:41:31,404 --> 00:41:34,134
I am giving all my attention
to my fingering.

548
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,382
- Hi. Hi.
- Mm!

549
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,445
- Hi, Carla.
- How's the show, Norman?

550
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:52,517
The show is very, very good. This is like
being trapped in an airport in Budapest.

551
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,654
I've got to make a quick call
before we eat. Max!

552
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,096
- The phone is where?
- Right outside the men's room, Norman.

553
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,635
Good design.
Just like American restaurants.

554
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,694
You know, my father's been beggin' for you
to come back and say hello.

555
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,966
He's right here in the kitchen.
You want to come?

556
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,031
We'll be, uh...
Be right back, okay?

557
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,101
Right back.

558
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:13,381
What was that?

559
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:17,149
Claude came to Max's hotel room
today while I was there.

560
00:42:17,222 --> 00:42:19,622
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

561
00:42:19,691 --> 00:42:22,422
- Did he see you?
- No, but I think he heard me.

562
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:26,591
That is why he's been
acting so strange!

563
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:30,125
I bet you he found out that you and Max
used our apartment when he was out of town.

564
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:35,006
If I would have known what you two were
going to do, I never would have let you in.

565
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:37,704
Well, we didn't know what
we were gonna do either.

566
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:40,646
Anyway, don't worry about it.
Max is handling it right now.

567
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:43,583
He's gonna tell him everything, and
I'm sure Claude will understand perfectly.

568
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:47,021
You know what's goin' on, don't you?

569
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:49,024
- What do you think?
- Claude, I owe you an explanation.

570
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:51,185
- Oh, is that all you owe me?
- Come on, will ya?

571
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:53,855
You were no stranger to married women
before you and Daniella got together.

572
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:56,662
- Don't put me into the category...
- Yeah, but they weren't married to friends!

573
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:59,202
I know. Due to extenuating circumstances.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

574
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,707
The only thing extenuating is your pecker,
which arises automatically...

575
00:43:02,775 --> 00:43:04,800
in the presence of
the nearest female flesh!

576
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:06,708
- I don't blame you for being upset.
- Oh, thank you.

577
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:09,476
- I'm glad you're so understanding.
- I didn't start it.

578
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:13,018
Are you trying to tell me
she started it?

579
00:43:13,086 --> 00:43:15,020
It isn't important who started it.
It just happened.

580
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:17,455
- Excuse me.
- I'm not apologizing for it.

581
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,187
Well, what are you
apologizing for?

582
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:23,129
- I was apologizing for using your apartment.
- Oh, let me get this straight.

583
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:27,464
You're not apologizing for the affair,
just for using our... apartment!

584
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:30,004
- Keep your voice down, will you?
- Oh, I'll be calm.

585
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:32,803
You want us to come to the hotel
in the middle of the night?

586
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,207
- End up in The Enquirer, right?
- Yeah. Anywhere.

587
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:37,907
Right, Claude? Right.
Would you calm down?

588
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,576
- All right, what are you...
- Look, this is nothing serious!

589
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:44,679
- Nothing serious?
- No, I'm gonna see her a few more times, and that'll be it.

590
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,747
- Take your hands off!.Jesus!
- Hey.

591
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49,385
If it hadn't been me,
it would have been somebody else.

592
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,829
Papa Stein's pride and joy,
Max Stein!

593
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:59,030
Max.

594
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:03,436
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Claude Eastman!

595
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:12,381
Do you think we could get him to join me in
a serenade to his lovely new bride, Daniella?

596
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:17,556
That's not what he just told me
in the kitchen! Give me a fiddle.

597
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,561
Ladies and gentlemen...

598
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:22,689
the greatest conductor in the world,
and the worst fiddler in the club...

599
00:44:22,766 --> 00:44:24,757
Mr. Claude Eastman.

600
00:46:24,337 --> 00:46:26,829
This is insane, Claude.

601
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:32,070
Huh? I know you're angry with me.

602
00:46:35,683 --> 00:46:39,620
- Can't we talk about it?
- There's nothing left to talk about.

603
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,392
In Italy, when this kind of thing happens,
we show our emotions.

604
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:47,453
In New York, we sulk.

605
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,532
No! No, no, no, no, no,
Claude.

606
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,659
I won't let you ignore me like this.

607
00:46:52,737 --> 00:46:55,035
Hit me, huh? Come on.
Hit me. Hit me.

608
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:57,666
Beat me. Do anything,
but let's get it over with.

609
00:46:57,742 --> 00:47:00,837
No! No, no. No, listen.

610
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:03,346
- I know it was a stupid thing to do.
- Hmm.

611
00:47:03,415 --> 00:47:06,578
But when I let Max in, I didn't think
things would go so far.

612
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:09,621
- What did you think?
- I don't know!

613
00:47:09,689 --> 00:47:13,022
I thought he came to play...
gin rummy.

614
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:16,790
You don't even know how
to play gin rummy.

615
00:47:16,864 --> 00:47:20,061
That's why I went to bed.

616
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:23,002
You went to bed because you don't
know how to play gin rummy?

617
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:27,440
- No! No. I went to bed because 00 in the morning.
- Oh.

618
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:30,308
I was tired. I fell asleep.

619
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:34,577
You did it while you were asleep?

620
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,142
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, Claude.

621
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,313
- I had no control over what happened.
- Aah!

622
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:43,121
Believe me, he was "een and out" so fast
I didn't know what was going on.

623
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,526
"Een and out"?

624
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,530
"Een and out"?

625
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,965
Well, that's what happened!
I'm sorry.

626
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:52,595
I mean, uh...
I shouldn't have been so generous!

627
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:56,540
Generosity? Godda...
Is that what you call it in Italy?

628
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,635
Yes, that's what we call it.
What do you call it in... in New York?

629
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:02,773
In New York, we ca...

630
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,784
We call it shameful.

631
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:09,050
We call it disgusting,
immoral and unforgivable!

632
00:48:20,368 --> 00:48:22,859
Ed, have you seen my wife?
Did she come out?

633
00:48:22,937 --> 00:48:25,429
She just went around the corner.

634
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,034
You should have seen him. He's like
a different man. I don't know.

635
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:22,595
He's like every other man.
Give him time to cool off.

636
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:25,471
Go to a movie for a couple of hours,
come home, make love to him.

637
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,534
He'll be fine.

638
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,172
Look, I've gotta go now. Give me
a little laugh before I hang up.

639
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,742
- A laugh?
- Just a little laugh.

640
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,811
That's funny.

641
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:39,221
- Come on, Daniella. You can do it.
- I can't laugh!

642
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:41,317
- Yes, you can.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

643
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,660
Come on.

644
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:33,284
Hey!

645
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:35,287
Sorry.
Uh, excuse me.

646
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,999
Oh! Sorry.

647
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:49,060
Excuse me. Ooh!

648
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:54,741
Oh.

649
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:25,236
You whore!

650
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,390
- Anything else to sign?
- Nope.

651
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,456
He's all yours.

652
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:51,033
- What are you doing?
- What?

653
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,908
You walk out of an audition.
You missed a photo session.

654
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:56,140
You missed a meeting
with Columbia Records.

655
00:51:56,215 --> 00:51:59,013
- You don't even wanna know why I was arrested?
- Talk to a doctor.

656
00:51:59,084 --> 00:52:02,885
Don't! Daniella is cheating on me.

657
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:06,858
I wouldn't even know about it
if you hadn't hired a private eye!

658
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:10,625
You bit me, you...

659
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:13,132
Stop it! Stop it! Police! Police!

660
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,432
Police!

661
00:52:16,505 --> 00:52:21,101
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

662
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:28,174
- So you found Keller.
- Uh-huh.

663
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:31,085
What are you gonna do?

664
00:52:31,155 --> 00:52:33,817
I've done some time,
and I've given it a lot of thought.

665
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:37,521
- I know what has to be done.
- Two hours isn't "time."

666
00:52:37,596 --> 00:52:40,429
You spend two hours in that tank!

667
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:43,935
- I am going to do nothing.
- Nothing?

668
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:45,937
Yeah.
Don't you understand?

669
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,997
That cheating, conniving woman has given
me more happiness than I've ever known.

670
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:51,670
Who is it? Just initials.
Give me one...

671
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:54,236
- Norman! It's not important.
- Give me one initial.

672
00:52:54,314 --> 00:52:56,840
For me, it does not exist.

673
00:52:56,918 --> 00:53:00,945
That's an admirable quality.
I don't think I have that quality.

674
00:53:01,022 --> 00:53:03,253
You don't.

675
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,419
I'm a middle-aged man
married to a child.

676
00:53:06,495 --> 00:53:09,157
I should be grateful for
anytime she's willing to give me.

677
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:11,496
A year, a week, an hour.

678
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:14,264
If you'd be good enough
to give me a lift uptown...

679
00:53:14,337 --> 00:53:16,862
I'd like to spend some time
alone with my wife.

680
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,433
That's a good idea. Patch things up.
Clear your mind of those filthy images.

681
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,502
- Norman!
- No, no. I know. You know.

682
00:53:31,824 --> 00:53:33,758
Oink! Oink!

683
00:53:33,826 --> 00:53:36,056
Oink! Oink!

684
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:39,566
- Oh. Oh.
- How do you like him, huh?

685
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,261
Ahh! Ahh!

686
00:53:42,336 --> 00:53:47,070
Isn't it wonderful?
I got a few masks for us for Halloween.

687
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:48,734
You... Great.

688
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:53,612
So... are we still mad
at each other?

689
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:57,278
Us mad at each other?
Aw, come on.

690
00:53:57,353 --> 00:53:59,948
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

691
00:54:00,023 --> 00:54:03,550
No. No. I was... I was resting.

692
00:54:03,627 --> 00:54:05,618
Just working on the score.

693
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:08,257
Oh, I... I thought it was finished.

694
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:11,062
I just made a few changes
in the love scene.

695
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:13,070
Where've you been?

696
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:16,266
I was mad, so I went
to the cinema to cool off.

697
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:19,799
Would you believe, a maniac attacked
two people in the theater?

698
00:54:19,878 --> 00:54:24,077
Oh, this town is full of weird people.

699
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,993
Giuseppe, I have a friend,
a very close friend, who has this problem.

700
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,628
- Norman.
- No, one of the men in the orchestra.

701
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:43,638
- You don't know him.
- I see.

702
00:54:43,706 --> 00:54:48,701
- My friend is married to a beautiful young woman.
- Eh? Fortunato.

703
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:51,942
- And he's very much in love,
- Hmm.

704
00:54:52,015 --> 00:54:54,813
- Passionately in love.
- Hmm.

705
00:54:54,885 --> 00:54:58,822
But one day recently, uh,
he found out that she was...

706
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,824
uh...

707
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:05,794
Cheating.

708
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:09,927
Indescrezione.

709
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,474
I agree.

710
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:18,706
- Absolutely.
- Mmm!

711
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,873
I agree.

712
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:25,613
Now, if... If you were he,
what would you do about it?

713
00:55:25,687 --> 00:55:29,680
Well, if, uh, if he love her...

714
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:33,126
then he got to treat her
with kindness.

715
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,562
- Hmm.
- Sinceritá.

716
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:38,124
- Understanding?
- Ah, si, si.

717
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:43,139
“Come here, my darling.
Vieni qui. Vieni qui, carina.

718
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:46,837
"Oh, bella, bella. Perfetto."

719
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:54,114
“Carina. Bellis...
Oh, accomadati.

720
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:57,520
“Lie down. Lie down. Ohh.

721
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,821
"Bella bambini. '"

722
00:56:21,451 --> 00:56:23,681
- Capito?
- Oh, capito.

723
00:56:23,753 --> 00:56:27,212
And any man who would do less...

724
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,225
is less than a man.

725
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:33,356
I'll tell him. Hmm.

726
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,634
What about this one?

727
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,063
This one?
This one?

728
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:44,632
Yeah, you can erase it.

729
00:56:46,312 --> 00:56:49,805
What about this one?
This one! What about this tape?

730
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:52,216
- Robbins.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

731
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:01,796
That's that Claude Eastman job.
You can erase that.

732
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:04,833
Wait a minute. You gotta listen
to this. Let me hit the speakers.

733
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:19,249
Hold it! Freeze frame!

734
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:25,213
Major screw-up.

735
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:34,928
I'll get it. You get the elevator.

736
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,831
- Yeah.
- Uh, Mr. Eastman? Jess Keller.

737
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:41,841
Boy, am I glad I caught you.

738
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:46,609
- You know the guy on the tape?
- Yeah, I know. Max Stein.

739
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:48,309
- The violinist?
- Yes.

740
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:51,376
Max Stein,
the fornicating fiddle player.

741
00:57:51,454 --> 00:57:54,753
Listen, if you're as much a fan
of his as I think you are...

742
00:57:54,824 --> 00:57:57,350
you'd better catch
his performance tonight.

743
00:57:57,428 --> 00:57:59,919
It's going to be his last.

744
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:04,959
And so I look at that face...

745
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:08,733
and wonder, "Can I destroy something
so perfect, so beautiful?'"

746
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:11,299
- Bravo!
- But as Giuseppe said...

747
00:58:11,377 --> 00:58:15,006
"Any man who does less
is less than a man. '"

748
00:58:15,081 --> 00:58:17,072
Bravo!

749
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:25,683
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

750
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,753
Jess Keller to see Mr. Eastman.
It's very important.

751
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:32,323
- After the concert.
- Please, it's urgent! He knows me!

752
00:58:32,401 --> 00:58:35,234
- After the concert.
- That may be too late!

753
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:39,708
- I'm sorry, sir. After the concert.
- I know. After the concert.

754
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,966
Well, you were splendid tonight, Max.
Absolutely wonderful.

755
01:01:06,043 --> 01:01:08,705
That's exceedingly generous of you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

756
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:10,713
I know.

757
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:13,114
Max, I've been thinking
about the other night.

758
01:01:13,185 --> 01:01:16,177
I realize I've been behaving
rather foolishly.

759
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:20,419
Byway of apology, I'd like to invite you to
join Daniella and me at the Tea Room tonight.

760
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:22,120
Terrific. I'd love it.

761
01:01:56,701 --> 01:01:58,794
Testing.

762
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:00,860
Testing.

763
01:02:02,474 --> 01:02:06,467
Claude, old boy,
I want to tell you a story...

764
01:02:06,545 --> 01:02:10,676
that will kill you and Daniella.

765
01:02:13,386 --> 01:02:15,617
Claude, old boy...

766
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,017
Come.

767
01:02:22,397 --> 01:02:26,163
Daniella, my... dear, sweet wife.

768
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:31,172
Hi. I wanted to tell you
how moved I was by your concert.

769
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:34,608
You... You were magnificent.

770
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:37,203
It was for you.
It was my apology.

771
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:40,614
What?
Do you mean that, Claude?

772
01:02:40,684 --> 01:02:44,177
I've been acting like a bloody fool.
That's all over now.

773
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:47,884
I've invited Max to join us
at the Tea Room...

774
01:02:47,959 --> 01:02:50,360
as a token of my good faith.

775
01:02:53,932 --> 01:02:55,866
Hmm.

776
01:02:55,934 --> 01:02:59,769
- I don't deserve you.
- Well...

777
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,297
By the way, those wonderful
Halloween masks you bought...

778
01:03:03,376 --> 01:03:05,311
Do you have them with you?

779
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:08,212
Hmm. Of course.
They're in the car. Why?

780
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:12,276
We've been invited
to a Halloween party afterwards.

781
01:03:15,823 --> 01:03:18,486
The doctor says to the lady,
"We got good news and bad news. '"

782
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,256
“What's the bad news??' “Your husband
has to undergo immediate surgery."

783
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,923
"“What's the good news??' He says,
“I think we can save the violin."

784
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:34,908
- Ahh.
- Your wife's a great audience.

785
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,175
- No kidding. What a sense of humor.
- It's the Italian in her.

786
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:40,183
They love to laugh.

787
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:43,550
I mean, you only have to do this,
and laughs just...

788
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:50,860
Pour some more champagne.
Loosen the trollop's tongue.

789
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:54,161
Everything else is very, very loose.
Why shouldn't that be loose too?

790
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:57,032
Oh, my God!
No, Max! Please stop!

791
01:03:58,271 --> 01:04:00,263
Don't do that!

792
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:03,105
I cannot take it anymore.

793
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:06,374
Max, why don't you regale us with that tale
about those Armenian twins?

794
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:11,650
- Tell us.
- Zelda and Mimi?

795
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,950
Zelda and Mimi.

796
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:20,625
This'll kill you.

797
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:23,757
You're crazy.

798
01:04:25,836 --> 01:04:28,328
Good evening.

799
01:04:30,508 --> 01:04:33,966
- Max, right in here.
- Oh!

800
01:04:37,149 --> 01:04:39,640
Max. For you.

801
01:04:39,718 --> 01:04:42,449
- Oh.
- Mr. Pig. Le cochon.

802
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:45,685
- Look at that pig!
- The swine.

803
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:49,196
Darling, for you...
La donna misteriosa.

804
01:04:49,263 --> 01:04:52,926
Oh, la donna misteriosa.

805
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,936
Oh! I didn't understand a word of that.

806
01:04:56,004 --> 01:04:58,495
And, of course, for me,
most appropriately...

807
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:00,564
the filthy old man.

808
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:06,075
Let me see it.

809
01:05:06,149 --> 01:05:10,143
- That looks like you.
- Oh, it is me. It is me, yes.

810
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,711
My darling, let's stop off
at the apartment.

811
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:15,122
I want you to wear
that black dress of yours.

812
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:20,095
Good evening.

813
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:25,160
- Eddie. Happy Halloween.
- Mr. Eastman.

814
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:27,171
- Eddie, happy Halloween.
- Yes.

815
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:30,606
Under this monstrosity lurks
Mr. Max Stein.

816
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,838
Ta-da!

817
01:05:32,913 --> 01:05:35,541
He has been known to look better.

818
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:40,477
But he can look much worse.

819
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:49,587
- Darling!
- Yes.

820
01:05:49,665 --> 01:05:52,157
- Is this the one?
- Perfect.

821
01:05:52,235 --> 01:05:54,829
Hmm!

822
01:06:03,047 --> 01:06:05,208
Don't be too long
changing, darling.

823
01:06:05,282 --> 01:06:08,377
We don't want to be
late for the party, do we?

824
01:06:10,822 --> 01:06:13,314
Ah, Max. More champagne?

825
01:06:13,393 --> 01:06:15,861
- All right.
- Good. Let's go to the kitchen.

826
01:06:26,841 --> 01:06:29,674
Ahh. Max.

827
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,406
- What? Hey.
- Mm-hmm.

828
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,383
- To a memorable evening, buddy.
- I'll drink to that.

829
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,448
Mmm. Very good.

830
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:44,016
Max, old boy, I hope you'll excuse me.
I have a few things to tend to.

831
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:46,255
Well, you go right ahead...

832
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:48,491
but I'm gonna stay right here.

833
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:52,900
- You know, I should have had a bite at the Tea Room.
- Yes?

834
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:56,566
But it's all right 'cause
I'll stay here, I'll raid the icebox.

835
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:04,646
Oh, my God! No, Max! Please stop!

836
01:07:04,717 --> 01:07:08,380
Stop!

837
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:20,161
- Daniella, where are you?
- I'm still dressing.

838
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:23,933
Well, hurry up, darling.
I'll be waiting for you in the lobby.

839
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:32,974
Don't go back
on your word! I won't let you!

840
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:35,748
I'm gonna kill you and Claude!

841
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,456
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Oh, my God! No, Max! Please stop! Stop!

842
01:08:44,531 --> 01:08:47,695
Don't try and get away.
No way, Daniella. No way!

843
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:52,331
Oh, my God! No, Max! Please stop!

844
01:08:52,407 --> 01:08:55,434
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Police?

845
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,672
This is an emergency.

846
01:08:57,746 --> 01:09:00,476
I'm gonna kill you and Claude!

847
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:11,123
Yeah, someone's getting killed!

848
01:09:11,195 --> 01:09:13,595
Hurry!
1009 Park!

849
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:37,314
No! No, I...
No, Max! Max!

850
01:09:37,392 --> 01:09:40,088
Give me... No, don't!

851
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:43,427
No, spare me!
Max, don't kill me!

852
01:09:43,499 --> 01:09:45,433
Oh, Max! Max, listen!

853
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:48,265
- You've gone mad, Max!
- Jesus!

854
01:09:57,282 --> 01:09:59,216
Max!

855
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:01,275
How could you?

856
01:10:01,352 --> 01:10:03,446
- Daniella?
- What have you done?

857
01:10:03,522 --> 01:10:07,014
- Daniella? Daniella?
- What have you done?

858
01:10:07,092 --> 01:10:09,356
Daniella! No!

859
01:10:09,428 --> 01:10:11,363
- Yes.
- No!

860
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:13,365
- Yes.
- Daniella!

861
01:10:13,433 --> 01:10:16,664
- I thought you were our friend, Max.
- Daniella!

862
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:20,036
Having been found guilty
by a jury of your peers...

863
01:10:20,107 --> 01:10:22,803
it is the sentence of this court
that you be taken from this chamber...

864
01:10:22,877 --> 01:10:24,869
and thence to a place of execution.

865
01:10:24,946 --> 01:10:27,176
Execution? I didn't do it.

866
01:10:27,249 --> 01:10:29,376
Where you shall be hanged
by the neck until dead.

867
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:32,250
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

868
01:10:32,322 --> 01:10:34,381
Claude!

869
01:10:34,457 --> 01:10:37,620
Claude, I beg of you!
Please stop this!

870
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:40,687
Tell them I didn't do it!
Tell them I'm innocent!

871
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:02,421
Ah!

872
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,600
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

873
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,836
Bravo!

874
01:12:29,755 --> 01:12:34,750
Ah, Max. Max, you were
extraordinary tonight.

875
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:37,730
- I mean, really wonderful.
- I know.

876
01:12:37,798 --> 01:12:41,495
I thought I gave a certain amount
of help in the last movement.

877
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:45,404
- No more than any other conductor, Claude.
- I know. Please. Max.

878
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:47,408
Listen, uh...

879
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:49,808
I-I... Listen, I'm...

880
01:12:49,878 --> 01:12:52,871
I know I behaved
a little strangely the other night.

881
01:12:52,949 --> 01:12:55,645
I've been thinking about it, you know?

882
01:12:55,718 --> 01:12:59,485
Byway of an apology, I'd like you to join
Daniella and me at the Tea Room tonight.

883
01:12:59,556 --> 01:13:01,717
- Oh, you would?
- Yeah. Fifteen minutes, okay?

884
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:04,784
- We'll make it some other night.
- Some other night? No!

885
01:13:04,862 --> 01:13:08,264
It has to be tonight! Hi, Sidney.
Thank you. It was beautifully played.

886
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,392
It has to be tonight!
It has to be tonight.

887
01:13:10,468 --> 01:13:12,562
What's the big deal about tonight?

888
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,607
I-I-I... I made reservations.

889
01:13:15,674 --> 01:13:19,702
- Well, you cancel them.
- I've never canceled a reservation in my entire life!

890
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:21,872
- I, uh... Listen!
- Great.

891
01:13:21,948 --> 01:13:24,610
Thank you, jack. I have never
canceled reservations in my life.

892
01:13:24,684 --> 01:13:26,846
Claude Eastman does
not cancel reservations.

893
01:13:26,921 --> 01:13:30,254
- This would be the first time. My reputation would be shot!
- Would you relax?

894
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:32,451
- I'm relaxed.
- Just relax.

895
01:13:32,527 --> 01:13:35,691
- I'll be there in 20 minutes. I'm not staying long.
- Thank you!

896
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:38,255
What do you mean,
you're not staying long?

897
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:41,667
You can't just have a few drinks
and pop off. Daniella will be humiliated.

898
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:44,434
I will be mortified.
You... Please.

899
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,441
- Okay.
- Okay?

900
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:49,946
- Just let me slip out of my clothes, okay?
- No.

901
01:13:50,014 --> 01:13:52,710
No, no, no, no, no.

902
01:13:52,783 --> 01:13:56,880
No, you wear tails because "A":
You look great in tails...

903
01:13:56,955 --> 01:13:59,981
We might be going somewhere
where we have to wear tails, okay?

904
01:14:00,058 --> 01:14:02,960
Yeah. Tails.

905
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:05,327
Tails? Tails.

906
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:09,563
Because, honestly, I-I-I...

907
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:12,662
Lots of places in this city will not
let you in without tails.

908
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:14,764
That's true. Believe me.

909
01:14:14,841 --> 01:14:18,403
It's becoming obsessive, eh?
Tails, tails.

910
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:57,782
Ow.

911
01:15:04,966 --> 01:15:06,957
Ow.

912
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:50,940
God.

913
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,535
Ah.

914
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,296
Testing...

915
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:48,416
Testing.

916
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:50,976
Claude, old boy, I
want to tell you a story...

917
01:16:51,054 --> 01:16:54,046
Just a minute!

918
01:16:54,124 --> 01:16:56,958
Just a minute. Come in!

919
01:16:59,463 --> 01:17:01,761
Wh-What are you doing
in the office?

920
01:17:01,832 --> 01:17:04,267
- What?
- What are you doing in the office?

921
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:06,804
- Business. Just picking up on business.
- Oh.

922
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:12,474
Are we... Are we talking
to each other now?

923
01:17:12,543 --> 01:17:15,273
- Of course. Of course. Didn't Max tell you?
- No. What?

924
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:18,748
Well, it's all forgotten, and, uh,
the three of us are getting together...

925
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:20,808
at the Tea Room later.

926
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,879
Well, about 15 minutes.
Now, really.

927
01:17:23,957 --> 01:17:26,721
Don't you think we
should be alone tonight?

928
01:17:26,793 --> 01:17:28,886
Alone? Oh, no, no!

929
01:17:28,962 --> 01:17:31,523
- We have to be with Max tonight.
- Why?

930
01:17:31,598 --> 01:17:33,657
Be... Aw, come on.

931
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:37,728
Because, um, we've been invited
to a Halloween party later on.

932
01:17:37,806 --> 01:17:40,297
- Who's giving it?
- Friends. Don't ask questions.

933
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:42,309
Friends. Close friends.

934
01:17:42,377 --> 01:17:45,142
Have you got those wonderful
Halloween masks that you bought?

935
01:17:45,214 --> 01:17:47,273
- No. No.
- What?

936
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:50,877
I didn't think you'd be in this mood
to celebrate Halloween.

937
01:17:50,953 --> 01:17:52,888
Oh, come on. Don't be silly.

938
01:17:52,956 --> 01:17:56,483
It's my favorite holiday. You think
I'm gonna miss all that candy?

939
01:18:01,799 --> 01:18:03,733
Hey, kids! Hey, kids.

940
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:06,794
Uh, I'll give you...
I've give you $50 for the masks.

941
01:18:06,872 --> 01:18:08,806
- These masks?
- Are you kidding?

942
01:18:08,874 --> 01:18:10,808
- No!
- Of course not.

943
01:18:10,876 --> 01:18:13,368
- Let's see the money.
- Fifty dollars for the three masks.

944
01:18:13,446 --> 01:18:15,676
- I'm not kidding. Here. Hey, hey.
- Oh, my God!

945
01:18:15,749 --> 01:18:18,240
- Terrific. Thank you. Have a nice Halloween.
- You too!

946
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:21,482
- Okay. Come on.
- I can't believe you gave $50 for those cheap masks.

947
01:18:21,555 --> 01:18:25,924
It's the thought that counts. One
life, and it's all over. Enjoy it while...

948
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:29,293
The ambassador is sure that the
president would talk to the FB.I...

949
01:18:29,364 --> 01:18:32,265
but added that the president
knows nothing about the incident.

950
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:35,998
West German Chancellor Helmut kohl
today ended his Moscow visit...

951
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:38,870
- How long will it be before Mr. Eastman comes down?
- Pardon?

952
01:18:38,941 --> 01:18:42,935
- Mr. Eastman. When will he be coming through?
- He goes out the other exit.

953
01:18:43,013 --> 01:18:46,540
Too many people usually waiting around,
waiting for autographs.

954
01:18:46,617 --> 01:18:48,552
He likes to avoid that.

955
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,611
Are you kidding?

956
01:18:53,858 --> 01:18:56,191
A toast.

957
01:18:56,262 --> 01:18:59,925
Two beautiful, young people.

958
01:18:59,999 --> 01:19:02,298
May you never grow old.

959
01:19:04,371 --> 01:19:07,067
Testing.

960
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,166
Claude, old boy...

961
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:12,007
I wanted to tell you a story!

962
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,643
- Were you just talking to me?
- I just had a frog in my throat.

963
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,652
Oh.

964
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,655
I wanted you to tell us the story
about the two Armenian girls...

965
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,658
the twins.

966
01:19:23,726 --> 01:19:25,591
The Armenian twins?

967
01:19:25,662 --> 01:19:27,630
Zelda and Mimi.

968
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:31,190
To the best of my knowledge, I've never
met Armenian twins in my life.

969
01:19:31,268 --> 01:19:35,102
Max! The, um...

970
01:19:35,172 --> 01:19:37,266
The Armenian twins!

971
01:19:37,342 --> 01:19:41,745
Oh, no. You... You told me about
these two girls that you met...

972
01:19:41,813 --> 01:19:44,009
and they... they... Armenian girls!

973
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,017
Armenian girls.

974
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:48,952
That night I spent with the two Argentinean
girls in the boarding school in Buenos Aires.

975
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:51,786
Right! Right. Tell Daniella.

976
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:56,223
Tell her!

977
01:19:57,966 --> 01:20:00,127
This'll kill ya!

978
01:20:07,476 --> 01:20:09,467
What are we doing here?

979
01:20:09,545 --> 01:20:12,709
Oh, uh, I want you to put on
that black dress you have.

980
01:20:12,782 --> 01:20:15,774
It'll look great
with the white mask.

981
01:20:16,987 --> 01:20:19,320
- What's wrong with this one?
- Do it!

982
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:21,858
All right!

983
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:31,932
I can't find the black dress.

984
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:34,997
- Put on anything!
- I thought you wanted the black one.

985
01:20:35,074 --> 01:20:38,066
Black, green, scarlet, pink!
It doesn't matter!

986
01:20:39,847 --> 01:20:42,247
Where are the sleeping pills?

987
01:20:42,316 --> 01:20:45,808
We never had any. Why would
you want sleeping pills now?

988
01:20:45,886 --> 01:20:48,048
Uh, n-never mind.

989
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:54,023
What happens if you take
a lot of tranquilizers?

990
01:20:54,096 --> 01:20:56,496
You go to sleep, I guess.

991
01:20:56,566 --> 01:20:59,034
- Are you under tension?
- No! No!

992
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:03,930
More champagne, Max?

993
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:09,546
Max?

994
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:15,612
Oh, there. Good.

995
01:21:15,688 --> 01:21:19,055
- You don't mind, do you? I'm still hungry here.
- No, no. Go ahead.

996
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,958
Eat anything you like. I'll just open
another bottle of champagne.

997
01:21:22,028 --> 01:21:24,792
No. Thanks, Claude.
I've had enough now. Okay?

998
01:21:24,864 --> 01:21:27,355
What... Come on. Have some champagne.
I can open another bottle.

999
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:29,926
- I'm not thirsty.
- You're kidding!

1000
01:21:30,004 --> 01:21:32,302
- I'm not thirsty.
- Don't be...

1001
01:21:32,373 --> 01:21:35,935
You're not thirsty? My mouth is as dry
as the bottom of a parrot's cage.

1002
01:21:36,011 --> 01:21:39,845
Drink with me.
Have a glass. Just one glass.

1003
01:21:39,915 --> 01:21:42,908
- These are good.
- Orange juice, okay?

1004
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:44,920
- Freshly squeezed.
- No.

1005
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:48,446
- Okay. Plenty of juices. Apricot. Cranberry.
- I don't like it.

1006
01:21:48,524 --> 01:21:51,983
It's heavy on calories. You don't want it.
Keep away from that.

1007
01:21:52,062 --> 01:21:54,553
Pineapple. No, it's too acidy,
with the peppers.

1008
01:21:54,632 --> 01:21:57,193
A glass of milk.
A nice glass of raw milk?

1009
01:21:57,269 --> 01:21:59,931
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, water? We've got plenty of water.

1010
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:03,305
Pellegrino, Vichy, Perrier, Evian?

1011
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,469
Olive oil? Please!

1012
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:07,535
- You've got a Coke?
- What?

1013
01:22:07,613 --> 01:22:10,310
Just give me a Coke, all right?
A Coke?

1014
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:13,512
- You know what a Coke...
- A Coke! Coca-Cola!

1015
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:16,784
I'll join you in a Coke.
Join you in a Coke. Uh...

1016
01:22:16,857 --> 01:22:18,792
You don't even have any Coke.

1017
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:22,125
- I... I've got Coke.
- Hey, Claude.

1018
01:22:22,196 --> 01:22:25,257
- I've got Coke!
- Hey, don't-don't... don't go to any trouble.

1019
01:22:25,334 --> 01:22:27,325
- It's no trouble.
- It's not a big deal.

1020
01:22:27,403 --> 01:22:29,394
- I want a Coke!
- Forget it.

1021
01:22:29,471 --> 01:22:32,373
Forget it? Are you kidding?
I want a Coke! You got me going now.

1022
01:22:32,442 --> 01:22:35,104
- You hit the button. There's a refrigerator upstairs.
- Forget it.

1023
01:22:35,178 --> 01:22:39,172
- No, we have a refrigerator swarming with Coke upstairs.
- You're out of your mind.

1024
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:42,413
What kind of a household
doesn't have any Coke?

1025
01:22:42,486 --> 01:22:44,477
We're out of Coke!

1026
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:48,959
I mean, this may go...

1027
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:52,155
This may go down in Italy,
but in America, it's unpardonable.

1028
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:54,324
I'm sorry. I took the last one.

1029
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,732
- What?
- Mmm.

1030
01:22:56,803 --> 01:22:59,932
- Claude!
- Give me that.

1031
01:23:00,007 --> 01:23:02,567
We have a thirsty guest.

1032
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:06,002
So it was dreadful.

1033
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,313
Well, he didn't bother to review
the Mozart, he won't bother with this.

1034
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:16,381
No. Because I went
through this last year with him.

1035
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:21,892
I don't... I do not want to do it.

1036
01:23:21,965 --> 01:23:24,297
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just coughing.

1037
01:23:24,368 --> 01:23:26,700
Don't bring him here.

1038
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:29,831
Just... Okay.
Promise me that, all right?

1039
01:23:29,907 --> 01:23:31,841
Shit.

1040
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:33,900
Sunday, 4:00 at Juilliard.

1041
01:23:33,978 --> 01:23:36,379
Okay. You've got it.

1042
01:23:36,448 --> 01:23:38,382
I don't care.

1043
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:41,284
I'll see you then. Bye.

1044
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:54,190
Cheers.

1045
01:24:03,713 --> 01:24:06,648
I'll just go and hurry Daniella up.

1046
01:24:25,237 --> 01:24:29,173
- Oh, what a night that was.
- Oh!

1047
01:24:30,811 --> 01:24:32,745
This'll kill you!

1048
01:24:32,813 --> 01:24:36,442
Oh, my God! No, Max! Please stop!

1049
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:38,883
Zelda and Mimi.

1050
01:24:38,953 --> 01:24:41,649
I'm not gonna tell that story
in front of your wife.

1051
01:24:41,722 --> 01:24:44,317
Oh, what a night that was.
This'll kill you!

1052
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:56,670
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

1053
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:02,202
Daniella, where are you?

1054
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:06,046
- I'll be down in a minute.
- Oh, okay. Well, hurry up.

1055
01:25:06,117 --> 01:25:08,108
We're in the kitchen.

1056
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:12,351
Uh, I mean, we're... we're in the lobby.
We'll meet you in the lobby.

1057
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:11,687
Ow!

1058
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:16,121
Uh...

1059
01:27:18,502 --> 01:27:21,164
Your usual table is ready, Mr. Eastman.

1060
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:23,172
More coffee, Mr. Eastman?

1061
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,471
I never met
Armenian twins in my life.

1062
01:27:25,543 --> 01:27:27,943
Max! Oh.

1063
01:27:28,013 --> 01:27:30,504
- More coffee, Mrs. Eastman?
- Pass the salt.

1064
01:27:30,582 --> 01:27:33,313
Claude, it's so good
to see you. Check, please.

1065
01:27:56,078 --> 01:27:58,740
Eddie, where's my husband?

1066
01:27:58,814 --> 01:28:01,045
He hasn't come through here.

1067
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:04,518
- He just called me from the lobby.
- I haven't seen him.

1068
01:28:04,587 --> 01:28:07,113
- What's going on up there?
- Up where?

1069
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:09,352
There!

1070
01:28:09,427 --> 01:28:11,793
Oh, stop it.

1071
01:28:11,862 --> 01:28:13,854
- Stop it, Max.
- Has Mr. Eastman come in yet?

1072
01:28:13,932 --> 01:28:15,923
- What?
- Aw, shit!

1073
01:28:16,001 --> 01:28:18,492
- What?
- Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going?

1074
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,814
- Uh, Mrs. Eastman!
- Don't kill me, Max.

1075
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:21,704
- Uh, Mrs. Eastman!
- Don't kill me, Max.

1076
01:28:21,774 --> 01:28:24,402
Help!

1077
01:28:24,477 --> 01:28:26,411
Oh, my God.

1078
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:29,813
Saw him coming out of your apartment.

1079
01:28:29,883 --> 01:28:33,216
- He believed that Max and I...
- Oh!

1080
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:37,147
Claude, you believed that?

1081
01:28:37,225 --> 01:28:39,284
Hello, Daniella.

1082
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,353
Oh. Ow.

1083
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:46,265
And you...

1084
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:51,363
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Eastman?

1085
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:57,203
Ah, signora.

1086
01:28:57,281 --> 01:29:00,182
No!

1087
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:07,781
Does this mean you don't go
to the Halloween party?

1088
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:11,456
This means we're not
going to go anywhere anymore!

1089
01:29:13,933 --> 01:29:16,698
You're still living... You're alive!
That means he only killed Max.

1090
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:18,966
- Claude didn't kill anybody. What you say?
- Max is living?

1091
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:21,200
- Max is alive!
- What are you doing here?

1092
01:29:21,275 --> 01:29:23,436
Some crazy detective
called Norman.

1093
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:25,776
- What's going on upstairs? What's happening in there?
- What's going on upstairs?

1094
01:29:25,847 --> 01:29:27,838
- Whatever it is is your fault.
- My fault?

1095
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:31,011
A little mistake?
God!

1096
01:29:31,087 --> 01:29:34,614
- Hey, Claude?
- Hello? Hello?

1097
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:36,555
Claude.

1098
01:29:36,626 --> 01:29:39,027
You're not gonna tell Norman
about this, are you?

1099
01:29:39,096 --> 01:29:42,532
No, no. Some people
can't handle that sort of information.

1100
01:29:53,612 --> 01:29:55,603
My wife, uh...

1101
01:30:01,788 --> 01:30:04,780
I don't know what the hell you're talking
about! Let me tell you something.

1102
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:08,226
If they taught English on Ellis Island,
this never would have happened!

1103
01:30:08,296 --> 01:30:11,561
- You don't speak English!
- Norman, your father doesn't speak English!

1104
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:14,466
You leave my father out of this!

1105
01:30:14,536 --> 01:30:16,902
- You didn't kill anybody?
- No.

1106
01:30:16,972 --> 01:30:19,406
Leave my father out of this.
Don't bring my family into this.

1107
01:30:19,475 --> 01:30:21,478
- It was a misunderstanding.
- Oh!

1108
01:30:21,611 --> 01:30:23,636
Circumcisional...

1109
01:30:23,713 --> 01:30:26,615
Eh, circumstantial evidence...

1110
01:30:26,684 --> 01:30:29,619
was conspiring against you.

1111
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:31,621
I didn't do anything!

1112
01:30:31,689 --> 01:30:33,817
I know, but it... it...

1113
01:30:35,961 --> 01:30:38,395
No, no, no, no, no!
No, I...

1114
01:30:38,463 --> 01:30:41,024
I... I... You have
every right to be angry...

1115
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:45,594
but I did what I did because
the thought of you with another man...

1116
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:47,731
was driving me nuts!

1117
01:30:47,808 --> 01:30:50,606
- That was your fault, not mine!
- Dan...

1118
01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:53,407
I curse you,
and I curse your shoes!

1119
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,972
Well, if you believe in that stuff,
I curse your crotch!

1120
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,541
I admit I behaved badly.

1121
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,611
- Badly?
- Yeah.

1122
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:02,657
- You didn't believe in me.
- I...

1123
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,321
- Shut up. Shut up.
- We were cursing each other!

1124
01:31:07,396 --> 01:31:09,888
You remember when you wanted me
to give you that trim?

1125
01:31:09,966 --> 01:31:11,957
- I don't want a trim from you!
- Okay.

1126
01:31:12,035 --> 01:31:14,503
Oh, my God Almighty!

1127
01:31:14,571 --> 01:31:18,975
A Kennedy gave me this tie. Oh, my God!

1128
01:31:19,043 --> 01:31:20,977
Taxi!

1129
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:24,849
Daniel...

1130
01:31:24,917 --> 01:31:26,885
Okay.

1131
01:31:26,952 --> 01:31:30,445
Daniella, I don't blame you
for not wanting to talk to me.

1132
01:31:30,523 --> 01:31:34,118
Any man in your position
would do the same.

1133
01:31:34,193 --> 01:31:37,755
In my position.
Uh, our position.

1134
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:40,925
- So, where... where was I?
- Behaving badly?

1135
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:43,493
Right. You were
behaving badly. Thank you.

1136
01:31:43,572 --> 01:31:46,507
Me? Me? No. You.

1137
01:31:46,575 --> 01:31:48,566
- Right. Not me, you.
- You!

1138
01:31:48,643 --> 01:31:51,875
You. Hmm. Yeah.

1139
01:31:51,948 --> 01:31:53,677
All... All right.

1140
01:31:53,749 --> 01:31:57,686
The truth is, Daniella, I don't think
I'm ever gonna change, you know?

1141
01:31:59,523 --> 01:32:03,289
From being a jealous man.

1142
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,627
So, uh, just maybe...

1143
01:32:07,699 --> 01:32:11,032
uh, you'd be better off
without me.

1144
01:32:27,788 --> 01:32:31,781
Aren't you gonna stop me?

1145
01:32:39,802 --> 01:32:42,202
Listen...

1146
01:32:42,271 --> 01:32:45,297
I may be jealous...

1147
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:50,109
but I'm... really very sick.

1148
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:57,883
Oh.

1149
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:07,723
I guess we're... not going
to the Halloween party.

1150
01:33:07,801 --> 01:33:10,429
No, and they're not
very good friends anyway.

1151
01:33:14,575 --> 01:33:17,908
We can go if you want to.
I'm fine, really.

1152
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:20,812
They're nice people.
Very nice people.

1153
01:33:20,882 --> 01:33:24,148
Have a cup of coffee.
I'll be very nice.
