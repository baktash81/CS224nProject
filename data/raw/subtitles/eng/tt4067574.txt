2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,060
NARRATOR: For
 nearly 2,000 years,

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,660
the world has been turned
 upside down over what can only

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,550
be called the most
 controversial book of all time.

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,620
To its critics, the Bible
 is merely a combination

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,430
of myth and legend
 mingled with history.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,590
But for those who believe
 in its sacred writings,

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,210
it is the inspired and
 inherent word of God.

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,910
A divine record that not only
 tells the way by which men get

10
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,430
to Heaven, but also warns of an
 eternal judgment for those who

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,350
reject the light of
 truth found within.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,700
Jesus said, "And this is the
 condemnation, that light is

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,190
come into the world, and men
 loved darkness rather than

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,690
light, because their
 deeds were evil."

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,680
[MUSIC PLAYING]

16
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,990
NARRATOR: After he was crucified
 and raised from the dead,

17
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,250
the followers of Jesus Christ
 went into all the world.

18
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,490
To the Jews first and
 then to the Gentiles,

19
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,080
they preach that Jesus
 is the true messiah

20
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,720
and that he suffered
 for the sins of men

21
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,190
according to the writings
 of the holy scripture.

22
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,950
-"To him give all
 the prophets witness,

23
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,420
that through his name
 whosoever believeth in him

24
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:35,550
shall receive
 remission of sins."

25
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,330
NARRATOR: But Jesus himself
 had said to his disciples,

26
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,650
"I send you forth as sheep,
 in the midst of wolves."

27
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,260
The apostles also
 warned believers

28
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,150
about seducing spirits
 and doctrines of devils,

29
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,200
and of certain men
 who would creep

30
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,940
into the church with
 deception and lies.

31
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,310
-"But there were false
 prophets also among the people,

32
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,220
even as there shall be
 false teachers among you,

33
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,760
who privily shall bring
 in damnable heresies,

34
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,950
even denying the Lord
 that bought them,

35
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,200
and bring upon themselves
 swift destruction."

36
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

37
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,990
NARRATOR: Through the Middle
 Ages many of the reformers

38
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,840
came to believe that
 these warnings pertained

39
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,470
to the rise of the Roman church.

40
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,310
In the Book of Revelation
 they saw the picture

41
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,950
of Rome's Apostasy presented
 as an unfaithful woman

42
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,370
sitting atop a
 seven headed beast.

43
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,320
"And upon her forehead
 was a name written,

44
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,170
Mystery, Babylon the
 Great, the Mother

45
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,750
of Harlots and
 Abominations of the Earth.

46
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,450
And I saw the woman drunken
 with the blood of the saints,

47
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,650
and with the blood of
 the martyrs of Jesus."

48
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,140
But the Roman church did
 not rise up overnight.

49
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,940
It came about one step at a time
 through the early centuries.

50
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,520
DR. RONALD COOKE: If you look
 at your early church history,

51
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,690
you had five patriarchates
 that came into being.

52
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,450
Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria,
 Constantinople, and Rome.

53
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,960
So you had five
 main church centers

54
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,540
over the first couple
 of hundred years.

55
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,700
But Alexandria
 fell, and Jerusalem

56
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,550
and Antioch also fell, early on.

57
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,350
So you're left with
 Constantinople and Rome.

58
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,320
So you had those
 two but Rome gained

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,700
the ascendancy in the West.

60
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,090
DR. HENRY HUDSON:
 There developed,

61
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,970
by the fourth, fifth, sixth
 century, controversies

62
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,710
among all the bishops in various
 parts of the world, especially

63
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,770
Europe and in the Middle East.

64
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,370
And whenever there
 was a controversy,

65
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,880
some court had to decide
 what the answer is.

66
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,930
DR. RONALD COOKE: And
 many problems that arose,

67
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,280
early on theological
 problems, would then

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:35,840
be sent to Rome to be
 looked at and answers given.

69
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
NARRATOR: While the
 New Testament church

70
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,700
had begun in ancient
 Jerusalem and spread

71
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,050
throughout the Gentile world,
 somehow the leadership of Rome

72
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,580
dominated as the chief
 oracle in matters of debate.

73
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,710
DR. HENRY HUDSON:
 Well, you've got

74
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,630
to remember the history of Rome.

75
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,460
The Roman Empire was a great
 empire for hundreds of years.

76
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,790
And the popes became the
 heirs to that kind of power.

77
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,760
NARRATOR: In the fifth century,
 one of the most well known

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,730
doctors of the early
 church, Augustine of Hippo,

79
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,030
would make reference
 to a conflict that

80
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,950
arose between certain
 African bishops.

81
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,470
Augustine wrote,
 "In this matter,

82
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,730
two councils have already sent
 letters to the Apostolic See

83
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,980
and from thence
 rescripts have come back.

84
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,840
The cause is finished."

85
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,180
DR. HENRY HUDSON: What Augustine
 was saying in that very

86
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,360
famous statement,
 he was saying this.

87
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,760
If Rome makes a decision,
 that settles it.

88
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,800
So they needed a court and
 the prestige of the empire

89
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,620
was in the city of Rome
 by Augustine's time.

90
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,910
And so that's all
 he's saying, he

91
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,930
said, when we have an
 issue, when we have

92
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,460
a difference of opinion,
 let's turn to Rome.

93
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,680
NARRATOR: In the centuries that
 followed, Augustine's statement

94
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,890
would be paraphrased
 by the popes

95
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,440
and doctors of the Roman church.

96
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,140
His words were taken to
 mean, "Rome has spoken,

97
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,420
the matter is closed."

98
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,100
In other words, if the Church
 of Rome sets forth an opinion,

99
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,200
all other churches must obey.

100
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,630
Then, in the fifth
 century, the ancient empire

101
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,770
suffered its decline and fell as
 it was sacked by the barbarian

102
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,850
tribes that would reduce the
 City of Seven Hills to ruin.

103
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,060
DR. RONALD COOKE:
 Rome was overrun

104
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,820
by the Huns and Attila the Hun.

105
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,950
And so the whole system of
 the empire was defeated.

106
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,070
And so the popes
 then began to take

107
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,730
the place of the
 ancient ceasars.

108
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,330
And so they came to take over
 not only spiritual leadership

109
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,110
but also political leadership.

110
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,570
And so Rome from then on
 grasped at more and more power.

111
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,650
And that's how the papacy
 really came into being.

112
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,620
NARRATOR: While the papacy
 did not spring up overnight,

113
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,000
and there were many events
 that led to its development,

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,730
the date most often looked
 to by Protestant historians

115
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,140
is 606 AD, when the Roman
 emperor, Phocas, named Pope

116
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,250
Boniface the Third
 the universal bishop

117
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,390
over all the Christian churches.

118
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,130
This is when the
 papal power was said

119
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,640
to be officially
 established in Rome.

120
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,860
ROGER OAKLAND: For a man to
 say that he is the true leader

121
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,230
of all Christianity
 is not only unbiblical

122
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,900
but it goes completely
 against God's word

123
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,680
and it opens the door
 for a control system

124
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,770
to be set up that can control
 the world that Satan can use.

125
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,960
And so I would say
 that this concept

126
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,820
of a pope from the beginning
 was Satan's plan for man

127
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,700
to manipulate the church,
 in the name of Christ,

128
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,600
but set up a system
 of anti-Christ

129
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
or anti-Christian belief system.

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Once the
 papal system came into being,

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,710
and it was clear that it
 represented an apostate system

132
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,570
that combined pagan
 teachings and traditions

133
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,000
with worldly politics, all
 under the mask of Christianity,

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,750
you had Christians then that
 fell into two categories.

135
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,800
There were those who followed
 after the teachings of the pope

136
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,230
and the Church of Rome.

137
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,400
And then you had those who
 were known throughout history

138
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,280
as Bible believers, who kept
 themselves separate from Rome

139
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,830
and were determined to base
 their faith on the scriptures

140
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,540
alone, without any kind
 of man-made doctrines

141
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,320
or sacred councils, which
 they had in the Roman system.

142
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,040
NARRATOR: It was because they
 rejected the pope's claims

143
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,120
of authority that many
 Bible believers were

144
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,190
persecuted in the
 early centuries.

145
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,650
English author Adrian Hilton
 writes that "The Roman

146
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,520
pseudo-Christianity caused
 many faithful believers

147
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,690
to flee into the mountains
 of Europe and Asia Minor

148
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,630
to escape persecution and death.

149
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,080
And there they continued,
 away from the world's view,

150
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,950
as the true Church of Christ.

151
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,170
DR. RONALD COOKE: These groups,
 in many cases, opposed Rome.

152
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,570
They usually looked upon
 Rome as the Antichrist.

153
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,300
They looked upon the
 Mass as blasphemy.

154
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,840
They didn't believe in
 the priesthood of Rome.

155
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,780
And many other of
 the teachings of Rome

156
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,990
they repudiated and
 claimed that they

157
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,220
went back to the early church.

158
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,440
Particularly the Waldensians,
 or the Vallenses.

159
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
They claimed they
 were the true Church

160
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,490
and they didn't
 separate from Rome

161
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,030
but Rome separated from them.

162
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,230
DR. HENRY HUDSON: They were
 Christians around who did not

163
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,540
always see eye to
 eye with the pope

164
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,460
or the Roman Catholic Church.

165
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,350
In fact there were
 a number of them.

166
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,380
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Do you
 believe these earlier groups,

167
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,860
the Waldenses and the
 Albigenses were Christians?

168
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,590
DR. HENRY HUDSON: Yeah,
 many of them were.

169
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,930
I've read their writings
 and studied their history

170
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,360
and they were willing
 to die for their faith.

171
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,930
DR. RONALD COOKE:
 The Paulicians also

172
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,530
go back into Armenia and other
 places, way back as early

173
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,140
as the fourth century.

174
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,150
They believe also they were
 continuing the true Church

175
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,850
and opposed, they
 opposed, everything

176
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,240
about the papal
 church and looked

177
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,160
upon it as the Anti-Christ.

178
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,660
NARRATOR: The belief that these
 earlier groups were in fact

179
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,500
Christians was
 held by nearly all

180
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,120
of the reformers including men
 like John Wickliffe, Martin

181
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,270
Luther, John Calvin,
 and many others.

182
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,630
In fact, many Christians
 are familiar with the idea

183
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,500
of America as a city on a hill.

184
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,860
Well that speech was originally
 given by Governor John

185
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,910
Winthrop, who was
 one of the founders

186
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,400
of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

187
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,010
And as he and the other
 Puritans came to the New World,

188
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,440
he gave this speech
 about America, or they

189
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,730
themselves, as a city on a hill.

190
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,840
But at the beginning
 of that speech,

191
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,020
he makes reference
 to the Waldenses

192
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,950
as an example of
 Christian charity.

193
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,470
In his speech, Winthrop said,
 "We are a company professing

194
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,470
ourselves fellow
 members of Christ.

195
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,340
We ought to account ourselves
 knit together by this bond

196
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,970
of love, and live in
 the exercise of it.

197
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,290
This was notorious in the
 practice of the Christians

198
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,780
in former times as is
 testified of the Waldenses.

199
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,910
They used to love or any
 of their own religion,

200
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,480
even before they were
 acquainted with them."

201
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Nevertheless, modern
 histories continue

202
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,010
to report that these early
 Bible believers were heretics

203
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,010
who believed in
 occult doctrines.

204
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,640
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): What
 do you say to people who present

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,000
those modern,
 historic arguments?

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,720
DR. RONALD COOKE: Well, I
 would say, first of all,

207
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,910
that a lot of our
 history comes from Rome.

208
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,640
We have to recognize that.

209
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:19,710
It was old Gibbon who said
 that when the wars are fought,

210
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,510
the victors tell the story.

211
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,450
I'm not getting
 his words exactly,

212
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,710
but that's the gist
 of what he says.

213
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,280
He says, in other words, it is
 the victors who tell the story.

214
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,840
So if you're a defeated
 Christian small group,

215
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,080
then you are--
 your story is told

216
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,350
from the standpoint of
 those who conquered you.

217
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,490
And Pelican, the
 modern American scholar

218
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:55,230
says, and there is no other way,
 many times, to tell the story.

219
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,570
NARRATOR: The common charge
 against the Waldenses

220
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,200
and Albigenses is that these
 groups held to unorthodox ideas

221
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,190
about God and that they
 were guilty of what

222
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,590
was called the Manichean heresy.

223
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,220
DR. RONALD COOKE: The Manicheans
 believed, they were dualists,

224
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,750
they believed in a God of
 good and a God of evil.

225
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:26,380
And that was one of the
 great heresies of the church.

226
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,680
NARRATOR: In time,
 the word Manichean

227
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,700
came to be a general
 term for heresy

228
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,000
but did not necessarily mean
 that a person actually believed

229
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,790
the doctrines of the Manicheans.

230
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,320
When Martin Luther begin the
 Reformation, the Synod of Sens

231
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,060
accused him of
 being a Manichean.

232
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,870
In fact, modern
 historian SJ Barnett

233
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,230
writes that, "During and
 after the Reformation,

234
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,190
Catholic propagandists
 hoped to undermine

235
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,400
the legitimacy of Protestantism.

236
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
Catholic apologists usually
 designated Luther and Calvin

237
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,560
as Manichean heretics from the
 third century dualist heresy."

238
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,270
DR. RONALD COOKE: When they
 couldn't find anything wrong

239
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,480
with a so-called
 heretic, they would

240
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,210
charge them with Manicheanism.

241
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,980
Because that was always
 punishable by death.

242
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,600
So if I couldn't find
 out that you were

243
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,860
a heretic in some other way,
 then I would just charge you

244
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,750
as being a Manichean and that
 way I could put you to death

245
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,010
and I didn't have to prove
 a whole lot of other things

246
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,920
against you.

247
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,470
So that was one of
 the tactics of Rome--

248
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,000
was to charge whatever
 groups were being charged

249
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,990
with whatever heresies they
 were being investigated

250
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,700
for-- to charge them with
 Manicheanism so that their case

251
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,520
could be made easier and they
 could be shown to be true

252
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,570
heretics.

253
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,100
So you cannot take a lot of
 the information that we get.

254
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,990
You have to certainly
 investigate it thoroughly

255
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,310
to find out what
 these groups believed.

256
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,000
ROGER OAKLAND: They
 refused to acknowledge

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,190
the dogmas, or the ideas or
 the doctrines that were being

258
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,430
promoted by men, that
 weren't biblical.

259
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,230
And so they took a
 biblical position

260
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,530
and because of their biblical
 position, they were persecuted.

261
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,190
NARRATOR: As we said earlier,
 most of the reformers

262
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,080
believed that the charges of
 heresy against these earlier

263
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,360
groups were falsely
 created by Rome

264
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,250
to justify her persecutions.

265
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,410
Yet most Protestant historians
 believe that the Waldenses

266
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,230
and the Albigenses were
 forerunners of the Reformation.

267
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,000
19th century historian
 William Jones

268
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,790
wrote, "That to justify the
 Wldenses and Albigenses is

269
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,750
indeed to defend the
 Reformation and Reformers.

270
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,440
They having so long before
 us, with an exemplary courage,

271
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,250
labored to preserve
 the Christian religion

272
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,870
in its ancient purity
 which the Church of Rome

273
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:30,150
all this while has
 endeavored to abolish."

274
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,280
To be more specific, it
 would be more accurate to say

275
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,400
that the popes have
 endeavored to abolish biblical

276
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,470
Christianity in favor
 of a religious system

277
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,190
of their own making.

278
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,680
And because of
 this, they have seen

279
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,420
the Bible as their chief enemy.

280
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,480
And this is the reason
 why they outlawed it

281
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,360
from being read by
 the common people.

282
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,830
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Throughout history, they

283
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,340
gave different pronouncements
 saying that you can't

284
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,810
give these holy
 things to the swine.

285
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,150
And they used that scripture--
 it's completely bogus-- pearls

286
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,840
before swine doesn't
 have anything

287
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,860
to do with giving the
 life-giving scripture

288
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,140
to the people, but the
 Roman Catholic Church just

289
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,470
looked at the common man
 as pigs who could not

290
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,070
possibly understand
 the scriptures.

291
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,150
NARRATOR: Because of this,
 Martin Luther, and eventually

292
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,650
the rest of the reformers, came
 to believe that the pope was

293
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,980
the fulfillment of biblical
 warnings concerning

294
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,640
the greatest enemy of Christ.

295
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,670
DR. HENRY HUDSON: If you make
 a study of the life of Luther,

296
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:46,060
you'll find that there was a
 very slow transition from 1517,

297
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,150
when he nailed the 95 Theses
 to the door, to about the year

298
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,090
1520.

299
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,290
So that's only a
 matter of three years.

300
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,520
But from someone who thought
 he was being faithful

301
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,680
to the church-- even
 though it was the Roman

302
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,120
church-- to the time
 he gets to 1520,

303
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,980
and there's a bull which
 actually excommunicates him,

304
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,030
he turns and he actually
 says that I am convinced now

305
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,260
that the pope sitting on
 the throne there in Rome

306
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,190
is the Antichrist.

307
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,380
Because he was so contrary--
 his power and teaching

308
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,300
so contrary-- to the basic
 truths of the gospel.

309
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,780
NARRATOR: Luther and many others
 preached the gospel of grace

310
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,800
and brought forth the
 Protestant Reformation.

311
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,590
But their chief obstacle
 was the conflict

312
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,790
between the biblical teaching
 of salvation by faith in Christ

313
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,310
as a free gift from God versus
 Rome's teaching of a work

314
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,810
salvation based on the rituals
 of the Catholic church.

315
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,410
DR. HENRY HUDSON: The
 Roman church was teaching,

316
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,410
had been teaching, for five
 hundred years or longer,

317
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,800
that a man is
 saved by his works.

318
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,540
And then, some of the
 contemporary scholars

319
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,420
say you're wrong.

320
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,770
Because the medieval
 theologians did

321
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,050
believe that the
 power, or the-- they

322
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,420
called it the potentia
 absoluta-- the potent power,

323
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,670
the absolute power
 of God can save

324
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,810
a soul by grace through faith.

325
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,250
Yeah, they did say that.

326
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,640
But then they said,
 yeah but there's

327
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,540
the potentia ordinata of God.

328
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,520
And you'll say,
 well, what is that?

329
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,790
Well, while God could do
 that because he's absolutely

330
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,570
sovereign, that's not
 the method he ordained.

331
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,270
The method he ordained was
 the church and the ordinances,

332
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,910
or the sacraments.

333
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,650
And through the sacraments,
 if a man-- the terms are very

334
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,610
clear-- you have
 to factura en quad

335
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,230
se est. That's Latin
 for a man has to do,

336
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,060
within himself, what he has
 to do to prepare himself

337
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,370
for what's called the
 merit of congruity.

338
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,820
And when he does
 that, then God comes

339
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,910
in with a merit of condignity.

340
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,630
So it's a very, very
 complicated process.

341
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,600
And that's still believed today.

342
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,770
And yet it goes back
 to the middle ages.

343
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,400
Because you're building up a
 storehouse of merit, and that's

344
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,050
the whole system.

345
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,490
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Is that
 basically works righteousness?

346
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,660
DR. HENRY HUDSON: Yeah,
 that's exactly what it is.

347
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,590
NARRATOR: While
 such debates might

348
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,300
seem tedious in
 the modern world,

349
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,420
to the people of the Middle Ages
 the understanding of salvation

350
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,570
was quite literally a
 matter of life and death.

351
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,370
Centuries later, and the
 doctrine of work salvation

352
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,460
through sacraments and rituals
 continues in the Church of Rome

353
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,610
today, where more than
 one billion Catholics

354
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,090
follow the teachings
 of the pope.

355
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,800
DR. RONALD COOKE: To deceive
 one billion people about

356
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,350
their eternal destiny, I think
 you cannot get a greater lie

357
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,920
than that, nor a greater
 misrepresentation

358
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,380
of the scripture.

359
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,270
When it says Christ has purged
 our sins when he sat down

360
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,790
at the right hand of
 the majesty on high--

361
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,140
and in the Latin vulgate,
 that is purgatorium--

362
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,240
it's the very same root from
 which they get purgatory.

363
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,570
But the Bible teaches
 nothing about purgatory.

364
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,840
The Bible teaches that
 Christ has purged our sins

365
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,470
and taken our sins in
 his own body on the tree

366
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,390
that we might go free
 and be pardoned and not

367
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,930
have to go to some
 purgatorial fires

368
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,220
to get our sins purged away.

369
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,040
So it's a blasphemy against
 the cross-work of Christ

370
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,070
and the resurrection of
 Christ that assures us

371
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,560
that our sins have been
 forgiven and that we stand

372
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,370
justified before God
 through the cross-work,

373
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,240
death and resurrection
 of Christ.

374
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,180
NARRATOR: To oppose
 the papal teaching,

375
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,740
the reformers declared that
 salvation was by God's grace

376
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,160
alone, through faith
 alone, in Christ alone.

377
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,930
PASTOR DAVID BROWN: Where
 John Fox and the reformers,

378
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,580
they rediscovered-- beginning
 with Martin Luther--

379
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,460
the just shall live by faith.

380
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,210
NARRATOR: And to
 prove their doctrine,

381
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,840
they were determined to make
 the Bible available to all men.

382
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,100
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Martin Luther

383
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,030
took Erasmus' 1519, a
 Greek New Testament,

384
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,690
and he translated his
 September Bible, 1522.

385
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,230
And they were sold
 as quick as they

386
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,260
could come off the
 printing press.

387
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,970
And people began
 reading it and realized

388
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,540
that Rome was telling them lies.

389
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,380
And they begin
 trusting Jesus Christ.

390
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,440
Hence, you had the start of the
 Reformation in Germany there.

391
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,700
NARRATOR: From Germany, Luther's
 teaching spread to England

392
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,610
and would influence William
 Tyndale, the man whose mission

393
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,330
would be to ensure that
 even a common plow boy could

394
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,980
read the word of God.

395
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,290
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:

396
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,670
started reading the word of God.

397
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,780
He had a desire for the
 people to have the word of God

398
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,900
and so the Reformation
 just breaks out.

399
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,230
And Roman Catholicism,
 the Catholics, they

400
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,240
can't put a lid on it.

401
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,270
Because once the people get the
 Bible in their own language,

402
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,060
the Bible says you
 shall know the truth

403
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,350
and the truth will
 make you free.

404
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:53,730
And people started getting
 this huge burden of sin

405
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,350
off of their shoulders.

406
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,470
I think of Thomas Bilney.

407
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,600
Thomas Bilney thought he was
 the Judas of his generation.

408
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,300
And so he thought he
 would do something

409
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,370
that was worthy of betrayal.

410
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,980
And so he went out
 and secretly bought

411
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,830
an Erasmus New Testament.

412
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,850
And he opened it
 to 1 Timothy, where

413
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,000
Paul says he's the
 chiefest of sinners

414
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,440
and that Christ came into
 the world to die for them.

415
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,810
He says if God can forgive
 Paul, he can forgive me.

416
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,320
He was gloriously saved.

417
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,560
And let me just tell you,
 he went to confession.

418
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,600
And he goes and
 confesses to Latimer.

419
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,670
Tells Latimer, father
 Latimer, he tells him,

420
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,370
father, I've sinned.

421
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,200
I went and bought this
 Greek New Testament

422
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,190
and I read about how
 Jesus Christ forgives sins

423
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,760
and I've trusted Jesus
 Christ as my personal Savior.

424
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,360
And Latimer says,
 in his own words,

425
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,090
reading "Fox's Book of Martyrs,"
 I learned more that day,

426
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,140
from that confession of Thomas
 Bilney that I had learned

427
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,370
in 20 years of
 studying the scripture.

428
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,090
It happened to be that
 Hugh Latimer comes

429
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,190
to know Jesus Christ
 as his personal Savior.

430
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,910
So as the word of God gets
 out, Chris, it's like a fire.

431
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,990
It goes and people read
 it, and they're set free.

432
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,130
And I'll tell you, Bilney says
 it was sweeter than eating

433
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,110
fresh honey out of
 the honeycomb as he's

434
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,790
talking about the scriptures.

435
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,720
Even it's said of
 William Tyndale,

436
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,000
he was a man who was singularly
 addicted to the scriptures.

437
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,520
NARRATOR: Like William Tyndale,
 Thomas Bilney and Hugh Latimer

438
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,930
would both be condemned
 by the Church of Rome

439
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,920
and were burned at the stake for
 their faith in the word of God.

440
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,330
Nevertheless, their
 sacrifice was not in vain,

441
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,490
as their deaths and
 those of many others,

442
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,160
inspired countless souls
 across Europe to turn from Rome

443
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,230
and embrace the true gospel.

444
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,500
VOICE OFFSCREEN: And they were
 burning the saints of God.

445
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Thank God the the gospel
 burned with mighty fire.

446
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:31,170
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:

447
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,610
cast kept them
 opressed and surpressed

448
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,540
and it kept them under
 a bondage of guilt.

449
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,610
And Jesus Christ through the
 scriptures sets them free.

450
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,270
The Holy Spirit used the holy
 word of God to set them free.

451
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,200
NARRATOR: But this
 freedom would not

452
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,020
be proclaimed
 without consequence.

453
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,460
The Church of Rome responded
 with its own counter attack.

454
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,520
CHRISTIAN PINTO: To understand
 what the Vatican did next,

455
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,860
we have to realize
 the tremendous impact

456
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,650
that the Reformation had.

457
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,750
Protestant historian JA Wylie
 wrote that the Reformation had

458
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,280
transformed whole
 countries all over Europe

459
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,020
and it would ultimately
 change the world.

460
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,190
NARRATOR: Wylie wrote that,
 "Advancing over all opposition,

461
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,810
this great religious revival,
 not yet half a century old

462
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,330
had acquired a strength and
 a breadth truly amazing.

463
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,120
From the little Saxon
 town of Wittenburg,

464
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,020
it had spread itself
 out, comprehending

465
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,820
the powerful kingdoms of
 Saxony, Pomerania, Poland,

466
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,700
Bohemia, Hungary,
 and Transylvania.

467
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,220
The Reformation had been
 welcomed by Norway, Sweden,

468
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,630
Denmark, Holland,
 and the Netherlands.

469
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,070
Its career had been one of
 unimpeded, continuous victory.

470
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,680
The South and West of
 France were Protestant,

471
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,090
and the supremacy
 of the Reformation

472
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,720
seemed all but certain.

473
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,220
Of the countries
 of Western Europe,

474
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:24,480
only two, Italy and Spain,
 now remained with the pope."

475
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,610
DR. RONALD COOKE:
 They didn't take

476
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,680
Martin Luther
 seriously at first.

477
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,870
Nor did they take his
 movement very seriously.

478
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,010
But as it began to
 spread, they realized

479
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,350
they had a real fight on
 their hands, so to speak.

480
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,200
NARRATOR: In 1540,
 the pope commissioned

481
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,670
a former Spanish soldier,
 named Ignatius Loyola,

482
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,410
to form a military
 company of priests

483
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,780
within the Catholic church.

484
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,860
Their chief purpose was to
 launch a Counter Reformation,

485
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,960
to destroy the work
 of the reformers,

486
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,010
and bring the
 Protestant churches back

487
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,980
under the authority of the pope.

488
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,700
They were named the Society of
 Jesus, or as their enemies call

489
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,640
them, the Jesuits.

490
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:22,660
DR. RONALD COOKE: Malachi

491
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,940
Catholic writer, would
 practically call them

492
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,980
the storm troopers
 of the papacy.

493
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,510
Their idea was to defeat the
 Protestant churches there

494
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,300
that were going on
 throughout Europe

495
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,940
at the time of the Reformation.

496
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,570
And then to continue that
 work in education, the forming

497
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,080
of universities,
 colleges, seminaries,

498
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,840
all across America
 and across Europe.

499
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,020
So the Jesuits really have been
 engaged in just about every

500
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:02,070
kind of activity known to man,
 educational, and subversive,

501
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,470
intrigue.

502
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,690
And many people have said they
 were linked to assassinations.

503
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,470
So the Counter Reformation
 involved wars, sieges,

504
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:19,590
everything under the sun, to
 try to defeat Protestantism.

505
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,790
NARRATOR: But the key point
 of contention was the Bible.

506
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,150
It was how the reformers
 understood the scripture

507
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,220
and preached to the
 population at large that

508
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,700
was the greatest threat to Rome.

509
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,920
-They're dangerous.

510
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,560
They're dangerous
 to everything we

511
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,660
believe as the Catholic church.

512
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,210
And we've got to do
 something to stop it.

513
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,360
NARRATOR: With the
 printing press,

514
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,920
the Bible was being
 translated and duplicated

515
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,260
at unprecedented rates
 throughout Europe.

516
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,550
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 There was a rash

517
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,710
of Bible translation
 and Bible publication.

518
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,230
And it all came to
 a screeching halt

519
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,190
after the King James
 version of the Bible.

520
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,310
Virtually all translation stops.

521
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,980
There was such a
 flurry from 1526

522
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,480
until 1611.

523
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,210
It was so meticulously
 done by people

524
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,520
who believed that God
 had inspired his word.

525
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,210
NARRATOR: The King
 James translation

526
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,220
would in time be considered
 the crowning achievement

527
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:36,360
of the Protestant Reformation
 and would come to symbolize all

528
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,610
that the martyrs had
 suffered for the word of God.

529
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,750
But because of its association
 with the reform, something

530
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,810
the Vatican saw as
 an act of rebellion

531
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,390
against her authority,
 the King James version

532
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,530
would come to be hated by Rome.

533
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,490
DR. ALAN O'REILLY: That is
 the fruit of the Reformation

534
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,570
that the Jesuits want
 to destroy above all.

535
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,410
Because until they do that,
 they cannot be sure of getting

536
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,780
the entire world, and
 especially England,

537
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,710
back under the
 thrall of the popary.

538
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,590
NARRATOR: In 1825, the Jesuits,
 meeting in Chieri, Italy,

539
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,420
declared their intention to
 seize control of the Bible

540
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,190
as part of their
 centuries-old plan

541
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,110
to bring all the world
 under the power of Rome.

542
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,390
CHRISTIAN PINTO: If you
 study the Jesuits in history,

543
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,140
you discover that they operate
 more like an intelligence

544
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,080
community, like the CIA or MI6,
 rather than a religious order.

545
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,960
And they are primarily
 the supporters

546
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,960
of what is called papist
 or Romanist doctorine.

547
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,600
And this is the belief that Rome
 should govern the whole world.

548
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,170
It does not necessarily
 apply to all Catholics,

549
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,450
because many Catholics
 don't agree with it.

550
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,420
But papist doctrine is
 essentially the belief

551
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,110
that because the pope
 is the Vicar of Christ,

552
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,100
and he stands in the
 place of Christ himself,

553
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,750
and because Christ
 is the King of Kings,

554
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,810
therefore, the pope should have
 the authority to reign over

555
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,180
all the kings and
 princes on planet Earth.

556
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,870
And it is this doctrine
 that led to nearly

557
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,430
all the wars of old Europe.

558
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,840
NARRATOR: Even in the
 late 19th century,

559
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,460
Rome's plan for
 world dominion was

560
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,630
known and documented
 among English churchmen.

561
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,200
In 1888, a meeting of the
 Protestant missions in London

562
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,180
=ed that "the missionary
 program of the Vatican,

563
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,620
doubt it who may, embraces
 the conversion of Britain

564
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,390
and the United States of
 America, and through them,

565
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,960
the subjugation of
 the whole world."

566
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,400
NARRATOR: To
 accomplish their aims,

567
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,640
the Jesuits deemed it necessary
 to take control of the Bible.

568
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,400
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Because the
 Bible exposes all of the lies

569
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,910
and the false doctrines
 of the papacy,

570
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,710
it has always been
 hated by Rome.

571
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,320
And they've admitted repeatedly
 that the teaching of scripture

572
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,220
contradicts the teaching--
 the official teaching--

573
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,250
of the Roman Catholic Church.

574
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,030
And so once you realize
 that's the real conflict.

575
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,230
It's between the
 authority of the pope

576
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,640
versus the authority
 of the Bible.

577
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,080
And at that point
 the Jesuit doctrines

578
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,850
begin to make a lot more sense.

579
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,430
NARRATOR: In modern times,
 the Jesuit view of the Bible

580
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,540
was exposed by
 Doctor Ian Paisley,

581
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,530
the former first minister of
 Northern Ireland, who has spent

582
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,810
decades fighting against Rome's
 influence in his own country.

583
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,220
-We're not responsible
 for the violence.

584
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,830
The violence comes from
 the Roman Catholic Church.

585
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,410
NARRATOR: Calling himself
 a historic Protestant,

586
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,670
Paisley has continually
 protested the authority

587
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:24,190
of the pope, both politically
 and theologically.

588
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,420
-Ulster will not fall to him.

589
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,150
-I want you to see this wafer
 after it is consecrated.

590
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:39,580
The church of Rome teaches, that
 it is the actual body, bones,

591
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:47,590
blood, sinews and
 deity of Jesus Christ.

592
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,510
[CROWD APPLAUSE]

593
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:55,500
-The Lord Jesus Christ
 offered on the cross one

594
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:03,250
full, complete, and never to
 be repeated sacrifice for sins.

595
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,920
And God does not
 come down from Heaven

596
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,760
at the whim of a
 bachelor priest.

597
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,930
[CROWD APPLAUSE]

598
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,170
NARRATOR: In more recent
 years, Paisley spoke openly

599
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,430
on European radio exposing
 a document that reveals

600
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,540
the Jesuit's view
 of the Bible versus

601
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,510
the authority of the pope.

602
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,820
DR. IAN PAISLEY: Bishop
 Wordsworth, an eminent Church

603
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:39,610
of England divine, uncovers
 the secrecy of the Jesuits

604
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,260
in the exposure of a
 document, used by them

605
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,470
in their early days
 to compel Protestants

606
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,480
to submit to Mother Church.

607
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,850
Roman Catholic
 Confession publicly

608
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,660
prescribed and
 proposed to protestants

609
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,570
on their admission to the
 Roman Catholic Church.

610
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,690
We confess that we've
 been brought from heresy,

611
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,780
to the true saving
 Roman Catholic faith.

612
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,150
By the singular care of
 our supreme governors,

613
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,220
and by the diligance
 and aid of our masters,

614
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,060
the fathers of all
 the Order of Jesuits.

615
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:25,330
And we desire to certify this by
 our vows to the world at large.

616
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,930
We confess that whatever
 new thing the Pope ordains,

617
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,910
whether it be in scripture
 or not in scripture,

618
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,110
and whatever he commands
 is divine and therefore

619
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,220
ought to be held by lay
 people in greater esteem

620
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,720
than the precepts
 of the living God.

621
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,980
We confess that the
 reading of holy scripture

622
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,180
is the origin of
 heresy, and schism

623
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,800
and the source of blasphemy.

624
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,730
We confess that holy
 scripture is imperfect,

625
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,980
and a dead letter until it
 is explained by the Supreme

626
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,070
Pontiff, and allowed by him
 to be read by the laity.

627
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,540
We confess and assert that the
 pope is our most holy father,

628
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,800
is to be obeyed on all
 things, without any exception,

629
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,800
and that such heretics
 as contravene his orders,

630
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,430
are not only to
 be burnt but to be

631
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,650
delivered body
 and soul to Hell."

632
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,400
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 Since the Middle Ages,

633
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,220
that Jesuit's core agenda
 has had to do with compelling

634
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,960
their followers to renounce
 the authority of the Bible

635
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,880
in favor of the
 authority of the pope.

636
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,890
Then in the 19th century,
 their movement gained momentum

637
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,760
and through their
 textual critics

638
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,460
they insisted that the
 Bible was a flawed book.

639
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,200
And they set about
 trying to prove

640
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,450
all the flaws they
 could to the world.

641
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,830
And at the same
 time, they officially

642
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,890
declared through
 Vatican Council one

643
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,680
that the pope was infallible.

644
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,390
So their message was clear.

645
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,700
Don't trust the
 Bible, trust the pope.

646
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,000
The Bible's a flawed book,
 the pope is infallible.

647
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,030
And so this brought everything
 full circle to the conflict

648
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,370
that had been raging
 for hundreds of years

649
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,830
throughout the Middle Ages.

650
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,120
And that's ultimately what
 their meeting in Chieri, Italy

651
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,270
was all about.

652
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,190
NARRATOR: The information
 discussed by Jesuit leaders

653
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:33,500
in Chieri was published
 in 1848 by a former Jesuit

654
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,420
initiate named Jacopo Leone.

655
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,280
His book was titled
 The Jesuit Conspiracy,

656
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,460
The Secret Plan of the Order.

657
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,900
In it, he claimed to have
 overheard the plans of Jesuit

658
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,000
leaders and was compelled to
 write down the information

659
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,810
and publish it as a warning
 to the rest of the world.

660
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,030
Leone wrote specifically
 of how the Jesuits

661
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,220
intended to take
 control of the Bible.

662
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,760
Allegedly, they said "Then
 the Bible, that serpent which,

663
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,960
with head erect and
 eyes flashing fire,

664
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,020
threatens us with its venom,
 shall be changed again

665
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,640
into a rod, as soon as
 we are able to seize it.

666
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,390
Oh then, mysterious rod!

667
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:33,710
We will not again suffer thee
 to escape from our hands.

668
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,750
For you know too well, that
 for three centuries past,

669
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,230
this cruel asp has
 left us no repose.

670
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,980
You well know with what
 folds it entwines us,

671
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,810
and with what
 fangs it gnaws us."

672
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,020
According to Leone,
 one of the Jesuits

673
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,970
openly admitted that
 the scriptures do not

674
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,880
support the Roman
 Catholic faith.

675
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,440
Speaking of the Bible he said,
 "If I may tell you openly

676
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,160
what I think of this book,
 it is not at all for us.

677
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,810
It is against us.

678
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,210
I do not wonder at the
 invincible obstinancy

679
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:24,480
it engenders in all those who
 regard its verses as inspired.

680
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,010
In the simplicity
 of youth, I fully

681
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,050
expected on opening the
 New Testament to find there

682
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,300
the authority of a superior
 chief in the Church.

683
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,240
The worship of the Virgin,
 the mass, purgatory, relics.

684
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,230
But in every page, I found
 my expectations disappointed.

685
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,000
At last, after having read,
 at least six times over,

686
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,990
that little book, I was forced
 to acknowledge to myself

687
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,400
that it actually
 sets forth a system

688
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,100
of religion,
 altogether different."

689
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,960
CHRISTIAN PINTO: What this
 Jesuit priest acknowledged all

690
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,710
the way back in the 19th
 century is the same thing

691
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,820
that the reformers acknowledge.

692
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,780
They noticed that the
 teachings of the Bible

693
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,190
and the teachings of the pope
 were dramatically different.

694
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:16,550
The difference is that
 the reformers chose

695
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,940
to follow the Bible,
 while the Jesuits chose

696
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,890
to fight against it on
 behalf of the traditions

697
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,700
and power of the
 Catholic church.

698
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,480
NARRATOR: The view of that
 Jesuits toward the Bible

699
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,010
could be likened to that of
 the ancient Pharisees 2000

700
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,110
years ago, who opposed Christ.

701
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,610
As Jesus said of
 them, "Full well,

702
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,190
ye reject the commandment
 of God that ye

703
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,790
may keep your own tradition."

704
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,150
And again, he
 said, "In vain they

705
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,900
do worship me,
 teaching for doctrines

706
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,440
the commandments of men.

707
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,690
At their meeting
 and Chieri in 1825,

708
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,920
the Jesuits
 discussed the methods

709
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,780
to be used in their ongoing
 Counter Reformation,

710
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,080
and their plan for the
 subversion of the Bible.

711
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,540
They said specifically
 that "A few breaches made

712
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,300
in Protestantism-- whether
 these conversions proceed

713
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,580
from genuine motives, or
 whether they be determined

714
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,720
by advantageous offers,
 which shall not be spared

715
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,800
if the person be
 worth the trouble--

716
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,630
we ought, by every
 possible means,

717
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,750
to secure the aid
 of modern thinkers.

718
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,360
If they can be induced to
 write at all in our favor,

719
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,750
let us pay them well either
 in money or in laudation."

720
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,460
CHRISTIAN PINTO: The Jesuits,
 since the Middle Ages,

721
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,760
have been known
 for seducing people

722
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,050
outside the Catholic
 church-- even members

723
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,880
of Protestant churches--
 And making deals

724
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,200
with them to help
 the cause of Rome.

725
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,520
And this was especially
 revealed in the 19th century,

726
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,930
during what was called the
 Oxford Movement in England.

727
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,690
And it was in the
 wake of this movement

728
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,020
that the Vatican
 really pushed to try

729
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,560
and take control of the Bible.

730
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,650
And that's why it's so
 important to understand what

731
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,400
the Oxford Movement
 was all about.

732
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,690
DR. ALAN O'REILLY: In 1833,
 the Oxford Movement started.

733
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,540
It's perhaps not
 without significance

734
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:36,000
that we're not only looking
 at what Rome is doing,

735
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,610
we have to consider that
 the lord himself will bring

736
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,510
judgment on a nation
 that foresakes

737
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:46,240
him and foresakes
 the word of God.

738
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,420
The Oxford Movement
 was an attempt,

739
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,060
effectively, to Romanise
 the Church of England

740
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,770
and to get the Church of England
 away from the scriptures--

741
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,000
from the King James
 Bible-- and back

742
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,400
to the ritualistic
 practices of Rome.

743
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,920
Now, it was done in
 a very subtle manner

744
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,230
and it really typified
 the Jesuit approach

745
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:15,740
of Bishop Olatom which is,
 above all, not too much zeal.

746
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:21,710
And it tried to portray the
 true position of the Church

747
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:26,890
of England as a sort of a
 middle of the road organization.

748
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:34,440
But at the same time, it
 did promote what it called

749
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,500
a high view of the sacraments.

750
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,540
So that, although it professed
 to be against what it regarded

751
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,290
as extreme Protestants--
 sad to say,

752
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,670
Bible believing evangelicals--

753
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,990
and also what it regarded
 as extreme Romanism--

754
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,200
say, the persecutions

755
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,990
by Catholocism.

756
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,720
The Inquisition, perhaps--

757
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,440
nevertheless it
 sought gradually,

758
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,760
by publications of what were
 called Tracts for Our Times,

759
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,650
to give a favorable view to
 things like the Roman mass.

760
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,110
NARRATOR: In 1898, a man
 named Walter Walsh published

761
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,720
a book titled The Secret
 History of the Oxford Movement.

762
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,340
In it, he writes about the
 activities of the Jesuits

763
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,910
in England.

764
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,510
He recorded the testimony of
 a former Catholic priest who

765
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:36,000
told him, "In England, there
 are a greater number of Jesuits

766
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,600
than in Italy.

767
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,330
There are Jesuits in
 all classes of society.

768
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:44,370
In Parliament, among
 the English clergy,

769
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:49,560
among the Protestant laity,
 even in the higher stations."

770
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,960
He went on to say, "I could not
 comprehend how a Jesuit could

771
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,840
be a Protestant, or how or
 Protestant could be a Jesuit.

772
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,710
But my confessor
 silenced my scruples

773
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,820
by telling me that Saint
 Paul became as a Jew

774
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,150
that he might save the Jews.

775
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,490
It was no wonder therefore, if
 a Jesuit should feign himself

776
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,600
a Protestant for the
 conversion of Protestants."

777
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,510
Within less than 20 years
 after the Oxford Movement,

778
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:34,290
another movement began in the
 world of biblical scholarship

779
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,810
that would almost
 completely transform

780
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,960
the understanding of the Bible.

781
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,270
This transformation
 would be affected

782
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:48,000
by men who were of the
 Protestant profession,

783
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,200
but strangely worked in
 cooperation with Rome.

784
00:50:54,200 --> 00:51:28,840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

785
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,750
NARRATOR: Prior to
 the 19th century,

786
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,880
Protestant scholars
 depended on a collection

787
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,990
of Greek manuscripts
 that had come into Europe

788
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:41,940
after the fall of
 Constantinople in 1453.

789
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,230
Collectively, these manuscripts
 would form the foundation

790
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:50,840
of the New Testament Greek
 used by the reformers.

791
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,910
By men like William
 Tyndale, Martin Luther,

792
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:59,590
the Geneva Bible translators,
 and the translation team

793
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:05,270
for the King James
 version of 1611.

794
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:08,000
These Greek manuscripts
 were collated

795
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,580
first by Erasmus of Rotterdam.

796
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,740
Erasmus would lay the foundation
 for the traditional text

797
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,160
and further the belief
 that the scripture

798
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,870
should be read by all people.

799
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,470
ALEXANDRE VANAUTGAERDEN:
 To translate to French,

800
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,540
to English, to
 German at this time.

801
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,640
Because it was very
 important for Erasmus

802
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,790
that everybody can read the
 Bible in his own speaking.

803
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:38,220
He produced five editions
 of his translation

804
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:49,940
in 1516, 1519, 1522,
 1529, and 1535.

805
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,670
All the editions were
 published in Basil.

806
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,740
-The Erasmus 1522, it
 was really revolutionary

807
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,470
because here we have in
 this column-- and just

808
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,920
the beautiful artwork--
 but in this column,

809
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,440
you have the Greek.

810
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,240
And what Erasmus did that really
 blew people out of the water,

811
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,800
most people could not read Greek
 back then, but many of them

812
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,660
could read Latin.

813
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,250
Scholars could read Latin.

814
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,710
He took the Greek and he
 translated it into Latin.

815
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,910
And so many people had their
 eyes open because they started

816
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:28,140
reading Erasmus' new translation
 of the Latin from the Greek

817
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:33,170
and they found out that it was
 completely different than what

818
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:38,040
they had in the Latin vulgate
 of the Roman Catholic Church.

819
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:47,180
Then you'll see here,
 MDXXII, that is 1522.

820
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,330
VOICE OFFSCREEN:
 So this is Erasmus'

821
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,720
second or third edition?

822
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,880
-This is Erasmus' third edition.

823
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,190
It is the Foundation
 for Textus Receptus'.

824
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,460
Then we come to Luke.

825
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:08,780
Again, the Latin and the Greek
 that Erasmus had translated.

826
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,350
We can go all the way
 back to the apocalypse,

827
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,270
so this is actually the Acts
 of the Apostles right here.

828
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,730
But it, of course, goes all the
 way through-- page after page

829
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:25,470
after page-- there we go,
 the apocalypse, Revelation.

830
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,770
NARRATOR: The work
 begun by Erasmus

831
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,570
would be later continued
 by Robert Stephanus, whose

832
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:42,190
1550 Greek addition would be
 used for the Geneva Bible.

833
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,960
In time, his work
 would be furthered

834
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,820
by the famed calvinus
 scholar, Theodore Beza.

835
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,880
Beza's 1598 Greek New
 Testament was chiefly

836
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,620
used for the King
 James version of 1611.

837
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:03,180
But it would be some years
 later that the Elsevier brothers

838
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,760
in Holland would publish
 the work even further

839
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,180
and give the reformer's
 Greek its official name.

840
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,530
In the introduction
 of their 1633 addition

841
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:19,470
they wrote, "What you have
 here is the text which is now

842
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,640
received by all
 in which, we give

843
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,250
nothing changed or corrupted."

844
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,450
Hence, the Greek of the
 Protestant Reformation

845
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:35,970
would become known as Textus
 Receptus, the received texts.

846
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,220
CHRISTIAN PINTO: So that
 becomes the standard Greek

847
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,910
for Protestant scholars,
 and remained so

848
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,430
for nearly 300 years.

849
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,720
NARRATOR: But in
 the 19th century,

850
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,580
a German scholar named
 Constantin von Tischendorf

851
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,460
would publish what would
 become known as the most

852
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,000
ancient Biblical
 manuscript ever recovered.

853
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,930
His discovery would turn the
 world of Bible scholarship

854
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:06,450
upside down, convincing
 many that his manuscript

855
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:10,380
was a lost version of the Bible.

856
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,680
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 You have to go back

857
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,260
before that, with
 German higher criticism.

858
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,770
And they developed a theory,
 called the Recension Theory,

859
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,290
and in this Recension
 Theory, they

860
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,350
say that the Bible was lost.

861
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:35,340
NARRATOR: The Recension Theory
 was introduced by a man named

862
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:39,200
Johann Semler in
 the 18th century.

863
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,090
One of his disciples,
 Jakob Griesbach,

864
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:45,240
would popularize his theory
 among German intellectuals.

865
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:49,950
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Both
 Semler and Griesbach

866
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:55,220
held to unorthodox views of
 Christianity, to say the least.

867
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:59,190
Semler is known as the
 father of German rationalism,

868
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,340
and he clearly
 influenced Griesbach.

869
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,730
Rationalism in Germany is very
 much like the Enlightenment

870
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:08,810
in France, where they rejected
 the idea of the divinity

871
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,960
of Christ because they rejected
 the supernatural elements

872
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,770
of the Bible.

873
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,080
The virgin birth, Christ
 being raised from the dead,

874
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,700
him ascending, and so on.

875
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,530
All of that to
 them in France, it

876
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,760
was unreasonable because
 of the reason movement.

877
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,350
Well, in Germany
 it was irrational,

878
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:29,910
hence the term rationalism.

879
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,930
So they believed it was
 irrational to believe

880
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,070
those things, so
 they rejected them.

881
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:38,490
And this was the view of
 both Semler and Griesbach.

882
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,440
So Semler and
 Griesbach were two men

883
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,930
who essentially
 rejected the gospel.

884
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,540
And the rationalism
 that they were known for

885
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,240
took hold in Germany and Germany
 then became the epicenter

886
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,650
for higher criticism
 against the Bible.

887
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,130
NARRATOR: The concentration
 of activity in Germany

888
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:03,570
is believed to have been the
 working of the Jesuits, whose

889
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:07,220
aim was to destroy the
 confidence of Protestants

890
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,000
in the inerrancy of scripture.

891
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,600
This was acknowledged by
 Doctor Ian Paisley, who

892
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,240
had this to say about the
 ongoing war waged by Rome

893
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,460
and the Jesuits
 against the Bible.

894
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,570
DR. IAN PAISLEY: "And
 it's not the word of man,

895
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:33,050
it's the word of God.

896
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:36,280
Now, of course, Rome
 used to burn the Bibles.

897
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,230
She used to burn the people
 that translated them.

898
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:44,150
She used to burn the
 people that read them.

899
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,480
But that didn't succeed.

900
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,740
So, she decided
 upon another scheme.

901
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:53,000
That she would place
 her Jesuit priests

902
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,170
in the training of
 Protestant ministers.

903
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:03,650
And so, into the universities
 of Germany, Rome set at work

904
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:10,230
the whole structure of
 unbelieving higher criticism.

905
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:13,640
And she had in the
 universities men

906
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,850
who sought to destroy
 belief in the Bible.

907
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:24,940
And we became cursed with what
 was known as higher criticism.

908
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,980
And young men had their
 faith in the Bible

909
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:33,300
destroyed in the universities
 and in the training colleges.

910
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,570
And so, the men that
 came out to be ordained

911
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,700
didn't believe the book.

912
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,940
They didn't believe the
 creeds of the church.

913
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,210
They didn't believe in the
 historic Christian faith.

914
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:50,150
And they set to work
 to destroy the faith."

915
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,490
PASTOR DAVID BROWN: With that
 spirit of textual criticism

916
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:58,790
and non-belief in the
 inspiration of the word of God,

917
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:04,140
looking at the Bible just like
 any other book, scholars--

918
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,390
and even quote,
 Christian scholars--

919
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,470
began to follow that line.

920
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,780
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Textual
 criticism in the proper sense

921
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,830
is not necessarily a bad thing.

922
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,930
DR. D.A. WAITE:
 Textual criticism

923
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:20,060
is a word that is used to
 assess the value of one

924
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,070
great manuscript over another.

925
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:22,830
That's what it is.

926
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,150
It's the bringing of
 manuscripts together,

927
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:27,340
and then showing which
 is the one to go with

928
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,000
and which is the
 one not to go with.

929
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:34,450
NARRATOR: The practice
 of textual criticism

930
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,290
began in the Middle
 Ages and grew out

931
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:43,300
of the conflicts between Rome
 and the Protestant Reformation.

932
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,220
It is most often traced
 to a 17th century scholar,

933
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,270
named Richard Simon.

934
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,300
DR. H.D. WILLIAMS:
 He is the one who

935
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:58,250
is alleged to have really
 begun this whole process.

936
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,450
He's called the father
 of textual criticism.

937
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:05,270
He was a French Roman
 Catholic priest.

938
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,470
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 In the world today,

939
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,210
textual criticism can mean
 several different things,

940
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,560
depending on who's
 using that term

941
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,320
and how it's being applied.

942
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,570
You have textual criticism
 in the ordinary sense, which

943
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,970
is simply a process of going
 through ancient manuscripts,

944
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,770
collating them, and trying
 to remove any errors,

945
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,550
and trying to figure out
 what the original text was

946
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,200
and what it should be.

947
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,420
Then you have what is known
 as higher criticism, which

948
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:36,870
is where you give a historical
 analysis of the manuscripts.

949
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:40,170
And then you begin to question
 whether or not Moses could have

950
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,900
really written the
 book of Genesis,

951
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,190
or whether Peter could have
 written the apostles ascribed

952
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,690
to him, and you begin to
 question the authorship

953
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:52,280
and the historical
 nature of the Bible.

954
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,310
And this was the
 process that is usually

955
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:58,690
traced to Richard Simon.

956
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,900
NARRATOR: Simon entered
 the priesthood in 1670.

957
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:07,510
He was initially educated
 by Jesuit priests

958
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:12,110
and then later at the
 Sorbonne in Paris.

959
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:16,960
He would go on to enter the
 Congregation of the Oratory.

960
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,200
The purpose of the
 Oratory was said

961
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,440
to be "to interpose a
 barrier to the continuous and

962
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,350
disquieting progress
 of Protestantism."

963
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,080
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 All of the orders

964
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,330
that Simon was involved
 with-- whether the Jesuits,

965
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:41,790
or the Sorbonne in Paris,
 and then the Oratory--

966
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,340
they were all involved
 in variant forms

967
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,530
of the Counter Reformation.

968
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,460
They were all looking
 for different ways

969
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,280
to try and overthrow
 the Protestant movement.

970
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,660
NARRATOR: Yet Simon's focus
 was guided by the Jesuits

971
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,400
from the beginning.

972
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,840
It was they who laid the
 foundation for Simon's work

973
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,070
through one of their
 original members,

974
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:16,190
Alfonso Salmeron, who had joined
 with Ignatius Loyola in 1534.

975
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:21,060
We read that, "Salmeron paved
 the way for Richard Simon.

976
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:25,180
The Jesuits introduced into
 Catholic reading of the Bible

977
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:29,250
the parameters of
 time, place, context

978
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,170
and semantic structures."

979
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,690
CHRISTIAN PINTO: The idea of
 applying principles of time

980
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,060
and context don't necessarily
 sound like a bad thing

981
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,440
until you realize how
 they were being used

982
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,180
as weapons to try and
 undermine the Bible.

983
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,460
One example was a book that
 was written by another Roman

984
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,910
Catholic named Isaac La
 Peyrere during the same area.

985
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,540
And he had written a book
 called Men Before Adam

986
01:03:54,540 --> 01:04:01,230
in 1655, in which he argued that
 supposedly new information--

987
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,590
scientific data that had
 come to light from Greenland,

988
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,600
and China, and so on-- proved
 that men lived on the Earth

989
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,390
as far back as 50,000 BC.

990
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:15,310
Thus throwing into jeopardy the
 traditional date for creation

991
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:19,440
in Genesis, which goes
 back to about 4,000 BC.

992
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,410
NARRATOR: We read that "La
 Peyrere deployed the hypothesis

993
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:28,000
of men before Adam in order
 to attack the Calvinist

994
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,940
Method of interpreting
 scripture according

995
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,020
to the literal sense."

996
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,100
CHRISTIAN PINTO: And so the
 idea of higher criticism,

997
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,420
which grew out of this movement
 and is also called historic

998
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:44,260
criticism, the idea behind it
 is to arrange certain dates

999
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:49,070
in history around the Bible in
 such a way to make it appear

1000
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:52,870
that the Bible is not a
 historically accurate book

1001
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:56,020
and therefore cannot
 possibly be the inspired

1002
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,570
inerrant word of God.

1003
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,870
That's the whole point of it.

1004
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,190
NARRATOR: La Peyrere's work
 would have a powerful influence

1005
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,670
over Richard Simon,
 who would further

1006
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:12,360
the assault against
 reform teaching.

1007
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,370
We read that, "Simon
 sharpened historical criticism

1008
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:19,620
into a weapon that could
 be used in the attack

1009
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:23,280
on Protestantism's
 most fundamental error,

1010
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,230
the doctrine of Sola Scriptura."

1011
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,510
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 Sola Scriptura was

1012
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,780
one of the mottos
 of the reformation

1013
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,800
and it means, only
 the scripture.

1014
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,060
And it's the idea that the
 Christian faith should be based

1015
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:41,240
on the teachings of the Bible
 alone without any interference

1016
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,870
with the doctrines
 or teachings of men.

1017
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:47,810
And it's in contrast to the
 Roman Catholic teaching, which

1018
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:51,720
says that church tradition
 should govern the understanding

1019
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,200
of the Bible even
 if the two disagree.

1020
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,750
NARRATOR: In defense
 of his Catholic faith,

1021
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:07,350
Richard Simon wrote that, "The
 great changes that have taken

1022
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,770
place in the
 manuscripts of the Bible

1023
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:13,160
since the first originals
 were lost completely

1024
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,080
destroy the principle
 of the Protestants.

1025
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,290
If tradition is not
 joined to scripture

1026
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,750
there is hardly
 anything in religion

1027
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,980
that one can
 confidently affirm."

1028
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:35,290
But the Bible says of itself
 that the scriptures alone

1029
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:41,680
are sufficient for the spiritual
 needs of all believers.

1030
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,610
The apostle Paul wrote that,
 "all scripture is given

1031
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,930
by inspiration of God and
 is profitable for doctrine,

1032
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:55,210
for reproof, for correction, for
 instruction in righteousness,

1033
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,620
that the man of
 God may be perfect,

1034
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,440
thoroughly furnished
 unto all good works."

1035
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:13,310
Furthermore, God promises that
 he will preserve his words

1036
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:17,410
eternally and that
 they cannot be lost.

1037
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:21,640
The Psalmist writes, "Thy word
 is true from the beginning,

1038
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:27,300
and every one of thy righteous
 judgments endureth forever."

1039
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:31,640
Jesus said, "The scriptures
 cannot be broken"

1040
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,570
and "Heaven and earth
 shall pass away,

1041
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:37,260
but my words shall
 not pass away.

1042
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,590
For all flesh is grass,
 and all the glory

1043
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:46,750
of man as the
 flower of the grass.

1044
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:50,920
The grass withereth, and the
 flower thereof falleth away

1045
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,690
but the Word of the
 Lord endureth forever."

1046
01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:02,620
CHRISTIAN PINTO:

1047
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,640
you can define the conflict
 between Catholicism

1048
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,610
and Protestantism as a
 conflict between the authority

1049
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,900
of the pope versus the
 authority of the Bible.

1050
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,610
And this is the whole
 reason why the Bible came

1051
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:19,040
to be known as the paper
 pope of Protestantism.

1052
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,450
That was the name given
 to it by the Catholics.

1053
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,920
And these arguments
 against the Bible

1054
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,850
were especially active
 in the 19th century,

1055
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:32,680
during the same era that
 Constantin von Tischendorf went

1056
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,720
searching for his ancient texts.

1057
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,530
NARRATOR: The hostility of
 Catholics toward the Protestant

1058
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:45,550
Bible was written of by 19th
 century historian John Dowling

1059
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:50,430
in his book, The Burning of the
 Bibles, where he documented how

1060
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:55,580
Catholics in Champlain, New York
 were burning bibles in America

1061
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:00,590
back in 1843.

1062
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:05,330
The beliefs of Catholics during
 the 19th and early 20th century

1063
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:09,030
can be shown by the teaching
 of Cardinal James Gibbons,

1064
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:13,930
pictured here with President
 Theodore Roosevelt.

1065
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,900
Gibbons was the
 Archbishop of Baltimore

1066
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,150
and in his book,
 Faith of Our Fathers,

1067
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:23,640
he wrote, "Now the
 scriptures alone

1068
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,910
do not contain all the truths
 which a Christian is bound

1069
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,130
to believe because
 they do not contain

1070
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,990
all the truths necessary
 for salvation."

1071
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,680
A similar view had been espoused
 in England by Cardinal John

1072
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,630
Henry Newman,
 perhaps the leading

1073
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:52,800
Catholic apologist
 of the 19th century.

1074
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:57,830
Speaking of the Bible he said,
 "Surely the sacred volume

1075
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,190
was never intended to
 teach us our creed.

1076
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:04,810
And from the first, it has
 been the error of heretics

1077
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:09,430
to attempt of themselves a
 work to which they are unequal,

1078
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,400
the eliciting of a
 systematic doctrine

1079
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,400
from the scattered
 notices of truth

1080
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,850
which Scripture contains."

1081
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:19,530
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Essentially
 what Newman is saying

1082
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:23,930
is that the error of
 the heretics, so-called,

1083
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:27,320
was that they followed the
 example of the ancient Boreans,

1084
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,590
who searched the
 scriptures daily

1085
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,710
to test the things
 that they were hearing.

1086
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,980
And this is something
 that the Church of Rome

1087
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,040
has always discouraged.

1088
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,840
NARRATOR: One of
 Newman's contemporaries

1089
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,750
was a renowned priest named
 Thomas Edward Bridget, who

1090
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,890
said that true faith was
 "a surrender of the mind,

1091
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:49,220
to a living authority,
 known to be divine.

1092
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,090
Not a puzzle over
 documents, with the doubt

1093
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:55,740
about correct interpretation."

1094
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,850
Even the modern Catholic
 Encyclopedia openly

1095
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:03,560
declares that "The supremacy
 of the Bible as source of faith

1096
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:08,650
is unhistorical, illogical,
 fatal to the virtue of faith,

1097
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:12,930
and destructive of unity."

1098
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,940
CHRISTIAN PINTO: So we see
 that Rome's view of the Bible

1099
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,770
has not changed in 1,000 years.

1100
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,580
The reformers in
 their day were trying

1101
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:23,330
to recover the ancient
 scripture in such a way

1102
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:25,010
that they could have
 a full understanding

1103
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,350
of the word of God.

1104
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,340
But in contrast,
 the Church of Rome

1105
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,270
went about looking for
 weaknesses in the text

1106
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:34,420
so that the Protestant
 doctrine of Sola Scriptura

1107
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,350
could be overthrown.

1108
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,360
That's the difference.

1109
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,950
DR. H.D. WILLIAMS: They were
 losing people very rapidly

1110
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:47,000
because of the text
 that was preserved

1111
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,850
by the priesthood of believers.

1112
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:55,360
Because they were losing people
 from the Roman Catholic See,

1113
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,960
from their authority.

1114
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,260
They had to do something
 to counter that influence.

1115
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,060
NARRATOR: But while they
 were fighting against Sola

1116
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,670
Scriptura, they were at the
 same time arguing in defense

1117
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:13,280
of the Latin Vulgate, which had
 been declared by the Council

1118
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,930
of Trent to be the only true,
 authoritative scripture.

1119
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,950
DR. ALAN O'REILLY: And
 they also condemned

1120
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:29,100
Luther's conclusion
 that Jerome's Vulgate

1121
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,640
was a corrupt Bible--
 which we know it is--

1122
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,150
and they further
 condemned Luther's

1123
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:40,870
conclusion that to
 produce a pure Bible,

1124
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:43,440
either German or English
 or any other language,

1125
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,430
you did have to go
 back to what today we

1126
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,800
would call the traditional text.

1127
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,510
That is, for example, the Greek
 text of the New Testament,

1128
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,990
which is found in
 the vast majority

1129
01:12:55,990 --> 01:13:00,680
of surviving Greek manuscripts.

1130
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,620
NARRATOR: In their introduction
 to the Douay-Rheims Bible,

1131
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:08,100
the Jesuit scholars wrote,
 "Se see that by all means,

1132
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:13,430
the old vulgar Latin translation
 is approved, good, and better

1133
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,610
than the Greek text itself and
 that there is no cause why it

1134
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:23,510
should give place to any other
 text, copies, or readings."

1135
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:27,230
16th century Anglican
 scholar, William Whitaker

1136
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:31,880
said that "The Papists contend
 that their Latin text is

1137
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,730
authentic of itself,
 and ought not

1138
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:41,020
to be tried by the
 text of the originals."

1139
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,640
Meanwhile, Protestant
 scholar Francis Turretin

1140
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,900
summed up the debate this way.

1141
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,680
He said, "The question is
 whether the original text,

1142
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,770
in Hebrew or in Greek, has
 been so corrupted either

1143
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:59,360
by the carelessness of copyists,
 or by the malice of the Jews

1144
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,380
and heretics that it
 can no longer be held

1145
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:07,280
as the judge by which all
 versions are to be judged.

1146
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,230
The Roman Catholics
 affirm this, we deny it."

1147
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,670
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 So Rome's position,

1148
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:17,840
according to Turretin, was
 that the Greek and the Hebrew

1149
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,980
manuscripts had been
 so corrupted over time

1150
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,830
that they could not be trusted.

1151
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:26,540
And therefore you shouldn't use
 those manuscripts to correct

1152
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,140
the Latin Vulgate, which is
 what Erasmus had done back

1153
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,010
right before the
 Reformation began.

1154
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,160
And that was their main issue.

1155
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:39,930
NARRATOR: We also read that
 "In the preface of the Douay,

1156
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:43,730
Roman Catholics contended
 that the Latin Vulgate was

1157
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:47,120
translated from the
 Hebrew and Greek texts

1158
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,500
when they were more pure.

1159
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:53,290
Therefore, many contended
 that the Vulgate version

1160
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:57,710
was dictated by the Holy
 Spirit, was consequently

1161
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:01,930
of divine authority, and
 more to be regarded than even

1162
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:06,050
the original Hebrew
 and Greek texts."

1163
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:13,860
Hence, the Jesuit
 scholars at Reims

1164
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,930
concluded that the Latin
 Vulgate is not only better

1165
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,730
than all other
 Latin translations

1166
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:23,560
but than the Greek
 text itself in those

1167
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,250
places where they disagree.

1168
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:33,670
CHRISTIAN PINTO: So

1169
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,820
against Sola Scriptura were
 operating on two fronts.

1170
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:40,200
The first part was to discredit
 the Greek and the Hebrew

1171
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,800
manuscripts as being so full
 of corruptions and errors

1172
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,060
that they could not be trusted,
 thus proving that the Latin

1173
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,000
Vogate alone is
 the superior text.

1174
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,860
And step two, to argue
 that because the Bible is

1175
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:59,550
so difficult to interpret, it
 is necessary to rely on church

1176
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:03,500
tradition and the infallible
 teachings of the pope.

1177
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,970
So this is the
 academic environment

1178
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,540
that had developed for
 several hundred years

1179
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:15,160
before Tischendorf
 shows up in 1844.

1180
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,030
Now, Tischendorf had embraced
 the rescention theory,

1181
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:21,660
this idea that the Bible was
 lost and needed to be found.

1182
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,260
Then you add to that, you
 had Catholic scholars,

1183
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,550
like Cardinal
 Wiseman, who argued

1184
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,090
that the truest
 representation of the Bible

1185
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:33,090
would be found in
 the Latin Vulgate.

1186
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:37,460
And all of these elements came
 together in the 19th century

1187
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,920
and this is what
 inspired Tischendorf

1188
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,850
to take his famous journey.

1189
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,480
NARRATOR: Tischendorf's
 efforts were clearly

1190
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,150
aimed against the
 traditional Greek text.

1191
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:58,620
In 1866, he would write that "We
 have at last hit upon a better

1192
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:03,690
plan which is to set aside this
 Textus Receptus altogether,

1193
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:07,270
and to construct a fresh text."

1194
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:13,300
CHRISTIAN PINTO: The curious
 thing about that quote

1195
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,910
is that when
 Tischendorf says, we

1196
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,920
have hit upon a better plan,
 who does he mean by we?

1197
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,700
It sounds as though he was
 working with somebody else

1198
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,450
but he doesn't exactly say who.

1199
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,000
NARRATOR: For years
 prior to his journey,

1200
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,110
Tischendorf had been influenced
 by a prominent Catholic scholar

1201
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,950
named Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman.

1202
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,370
Cardinal Weisman
 developed a theory

1203
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:49,690
that old Latin texts had been
 developed in North Africa

1204
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:50,810
by the second century.

1205
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:54,700
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 Wiseman's assertion

1206
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,500
seems to have been an attempt
 to try and prove that the Latin

1207
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,290
Vulgate was closer to
 the original manuscripts

1208
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:05,430
than any known Greek
 manuscript at that time.

1209
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,650
And it was this theory
 that made Tischendorf

1210
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,300
partial to the Latin Vulgate.

1211
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:16,430
NARRATOR: We read that,
 "In 1842, while in Paris,

1212
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,860
Tischendorf prepared an
 edition of the New Testament,

1213
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,160
intended for the
 use of Catholics,

1214
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:25,300
giving the Latin
 Vulgate in a Greek text.

1215
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,830
Rendered as far as
 possible conformable

1216
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:33,120
to it, in parallel columns."

1217
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,320
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 So what Tischendorf

1218
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,210
did is he developed a
 Greek manuscript that

1219
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,560
would conform to
 the Latin Vulgate.

1220
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,370
He essentially reversed the
 work of Erasmus of Rotterdam

1221
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,450
from 300 years earlier.

1222
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:48,710
Remember, Erasmus had
 collated the Greek manuscripts

1223
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:52,170
and then published the
 first ever parallel Bible,

1224
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:55,390
with the Greek in one column
 and the Latin in the other.

1225
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:59,330
And he used the Greek to
 correct the errors in the Latin.

1226
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,560
Well, now, hundreds
 of years later,

1227
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,220
Tischendorf reverses
 the process.

1228
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,460
He does a parallel Bible,
 but he does it the other way.

1229
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,820
He uses the Latin to
 correct the Greek.

1230
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,740
And he did this work for
 the Catholic archbishop

1231
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,460
of Paris, Archbishop Affre.

1232
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,210
And so it shows his
 relationship with the Catholic

1233
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,610
Church at this time.

1234
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:25,220
It's also worth mentioning that
 one of Tischendorf's critics

1235
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:29,920
said that Tischendorf only
 understood Greek through Latin.

1236
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:55,260
NARRATOR: Tischendorf would
 make his great discovery in 1844

1237
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,440
when he arrived at St.
 Catherine's Monastery,

1238
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,980
at the base of what is
 called Mount Sinai in Egypt.

1239
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:09,200
But before he arrived,
 he took a journey to Rome

1240
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,060
and was received at the Vatican.

1241
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:21,140
In his memoirs, Tischendorf
 wrote, "I here pass over

1242
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:25,100
in silence, the interesting
 details of my travels.

1243
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:31,780
My audience with the Pope,
 Gregory XVI, in May, 1843.

1244
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:35,460
my intercourse with
 Cardinal Mezzofanti,

1245
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,860
that surprising and
 celebrated linguist."

1246
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:42,820
Mezzofanti was famous
 for his ability

1247
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:46,760
to speak more than 50
 languages fluently.

1248
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:50,630
Tischendorf wrote that,
 "Mezzofanti honored me

1249
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:56,900
with some Greek verses
 composed in my praise."

1250
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,280
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 Tischendorf was well

1251
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:03,250
favored by Rome, which
 is odd considering

1252
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:07,030
his status as a
 Protestant scholar.

1253
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,980
PASTOR DAVID BROWN: I can
 never quite figure that out.

1254
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:12,210
Why a Protestant
 scholar, or one who

1255
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,270
claimed to be a
 Protestant scholar,

1256
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:19,820
would be meeting with the
 pope over the situation.

1257
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,330
There's a lot of
 unanswered questions.

1258
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:27,600
CHRISTIAN PINTO:

1259
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,590
goes to meet in a private
 audience with the pope.

1260
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:33,420
It's like going to meet the
 president, or a prime minister,

1261
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,920
or someone of that position.

1262
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,350
And then we have this famous
 Catholic cardinal, Mezzofanti,

1263
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:41,230
writing him a poem in
 Greek to praise him

1264
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,970
as this great scholar and so on.

1265
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:45,410
It's all very strange.

1266
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:48,620
But Tischendorf was
 welcomed into Rome

1267
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:52,740
by some of the leading Catholic
 authorities at that time.

1268
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:55,410
In fact, in his
 memoirs, he reveals

1269
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,410
that it was Archbishop
 Affre of Paris for whom he

1270
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,480
had prepared the parallel Bible.

1271
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,570
That gave him his
 recommendation to the Vatican.

1272
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:06,330
And then he was received
 by Pope Gregory.

1273
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:13,020
NARRATOR: Tischendorf
 wrote, "Gregory XVI,

1274
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,840
after a prolonged
 audience granted to me

1275
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,440
took an ardent interest
 in my undertaking."

1276
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,350
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Pope Gregory's
 interest in Tischendorf

1277
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,520
is curious.

1278
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,400
Especially when you consider
 that it was the same Pope

1279
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,770
Gregory that openly condemned
 the Protestant Bible

1280
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:33,150
societies of that time.

1281
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,950
NARRATOR: In 1843, American
 author John Dowling,

1282
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:46,150
wrote that "The present
 Pope, Gregory XVI,

1283
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:49,160
and his predecessor
 Pope Leo XII,

1284
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:53,640
denounced all Bible societies
 declaring that by the Bible's

1285
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,070
they distributed they
 converted the Gospel of Christ

1286
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:58,940
into a human gospel.

1287
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:04,030
Or, what is still worse,
 the gospel of the devil."

1288
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:07,620
In his encyclical against
 the Bible societies,

1289
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,570
Pope Gregory wrote "We
 have taken great pains

1290
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:15,280
to remind the faithful of
 the ancient laws concerning

1291
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,830
vernacular translations
 of the scriptures."

1292
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:24,550
The pope's wording is suspicious
 because it was the ancient laws

1293
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:28,150
of the Roman church that
 had Bible believers burned

1294
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:34,060
at the stake for reading or
 handling the word of God.

1295
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,810
But could this have
 been what Pope Gregory

1296
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:39,050
was referring to in his writing?

1297
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:44,970
Several years after
 Tischendorf's private audience

1298
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:49,230
at the Vatican, it was
 discovered that the Inquisition

1299
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:52,750
had continued underground
 in the ancient city.

1300
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,860
Charles Spurgeon,
 known to millions

1301
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:03,400
as the prince of preachers,
 documented the manner

1302
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,520
of torture that
 had been reported

1303
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,710
once the papal
 dungeons were revealed.

1304
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:12,030
From Spurgeon's publication,
 The Sword and the Trowel,

1305
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:17,520
we read that "They invented
 ovens, or furnaces, which being

1306
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,730
made red-hot, they lowered
 the condemned into them,

1307
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:24,780
bound hand and foot,
 and immediately

1308
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:28,100
closed over them the
 mouth of the furnace.

1309
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,840
This barbarous punishment and
 was substituted for the burning

1310
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,580
pile and in 1849,
 these furnaces at Rome

1311
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,820
were laid open to
 the public view

1312
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:42,550
in the dungeons of the
 Holy Roman Inquisition,

1313
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,990
near the great church
 of the Vatican,

1314
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:49,250
still containing
 the calcined bones."

1315
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,030
CHRISTIAN PINTO: What's
 disturbing is that these things

1316
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:58,000
were revealed in 1849, just
 six years after Tischendorf

1317
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,390
visited the pope.

1318
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:03,800
And it was only revealed because
 the great general, Garibaldi,

1319
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,550
and his revolutionaries,
 captured Rome that year

1320
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:09,420
and opened the papal dungeons.

1321
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,890
But then you have a
 quote from W.C. Brownlee

1322
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:14,870
that was published in 1843,

1323
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:17,740
the same year Tischendorf
 was at the Vatican.

1324
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,900
And Brownlee says,
 "The Inquisition--

1325
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,260
the infernal
 inquisition," he says,

1326
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:28,400
"even at this day is in
 full operation in Rome

1327
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,300
under the patronage of
 Pope Gregory Sixteenth."

1328
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,860
The same pope that Constantin
 von Tischendorf met with.

1329
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:40,540
So while Tischendorf was in Rome
 with his cardinal writing him

1330
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:43,520
poetry to praise
 him and so on, there

1331
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,190
were people-- some of them
 quite probably Christians--

1332
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:49,870
who were still being
 tortured for heresy

1333
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:53,280
in the underground
 inquisition nearby.

1334
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,240
And they were being roasted
 alive in these ovens

1335
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,980
right next door to the Vatican.

1336
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,720
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Yes, the inquisition--

1337
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,970
actually not just in Italy
 but in other places--

1338
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:09,050
went well into the 1800's.

1339
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:12,040
NARRATOR: Discoveries of the
 Inquisition during this era

1340
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,560
were also exposed by
 Doctor H. Grattan Guinness,

1341
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:24,060
in the convent of Santo
 Domingo, Mexico in 1861.

1342
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:28,110
He published these photographs
 of the remains of victims who

1343
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:32,920
had been walled up
 and buried alive.

1344
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,650
The expressions of
 their torment still

1345
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,330
recorded in their countenance.

1346
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:53,830
Charles Spurgeon wrote
 that "The Inquisition

1347
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:58,190
was the masterpiece of
 infernal craft and malice.

1348
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:02,500
There is a deep and indelible
 sentence of damnation written

1349
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:07,480
upon the apostate church for its
 more than infernal cruelties.

1350
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,860
And the curse is
 registered in heaven.

1351
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:14,570
Nor can any pretenses
 to present liberality

1352
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:16,770
reverse the condemnation.

1353
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:21,500
Its infmay is engraven
 in the rock forever."

1354
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,000
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Rome did many,

1355
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,130
many, many evil
 and hateful things.

1356
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,400
NARRATOR: Yet somehow,
 during this era,

1357
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,800
the Protestant Tischendorf
 was not only accepted by Rome

1358
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,080
but received special
 treatment from the Vatican

1359
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,840
and her priests.

1360
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,900
Tischendorf's cooperation
 with the Vatican

1361
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,680
was a dramatic departure from
 the resistance maintained

1362
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,640
by other Protestant
 ministers of that era.

1363
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,570
Grattan Guinness called Rome
 the masterpiece of Satan

1364
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:08,200
and maintained that she had
 never repented of her crimes.

1365
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:13,620
In 1873, Charles Spurgeon wrote
 that "The superstition of Rome

1366
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:17,850
is the worst of all the evils
 which have befallen our race.

1367
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:21,320
May the Lord arise and
 sweep it down to the hell

1368
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,790
from whence it arose."

1369
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:27,880
Spurgeon was so convicted
 against the papacy that he once

1370
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:31,480
declared "Popery is
 abhorred of the Lord,

1371
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,600
and they who help it wear
 the mark of the Beast."

1372
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:47,020
Yet in Rome, Tishcendorf was
 not only welcomed by the pope,

1373
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:51,080
but by two of the leading
 cardinals at that time.

1374
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:55,860
The first was the well known
 linguistic, Mezzofanti,

1375
01:28:55,860 --> 01:29:02,120
while the other was a Jesuit
 named Cardinal Angelo Mai.

1376
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,460
During the 19th century, Mai
 was the cardinal librarian

1377
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:10,910
for the Vatican library and
 was credited with recovering

1378
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:16,000
many ancient manuscripts that
 pertain to church history.

1379
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,490
It was said that "There
 is not a single century

1380
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:23,770
of the Christian era, from
 the second to the seventeenth,

1381
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,850
from which he has not
 produced important

1382
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:29,910
and previously unknown works.

1383
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:36,360
He had transcribed all with his
 own hand entirely by himself."

1384
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:43,440
CHRISTIAN PINTO: This quote
 about be Jesuit Cardinal Mai

1385
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,550
is very interesting
 because it shows

1386
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,480
us the nature of the times.

1387
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,650
And so you've got
 Cardinal Mai there,

1388
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:53,620
who very much like Tischendorf--
 Tischendorf is out journeying,

1389
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:56,270
trying to gather all of
 these ancient manuscripts--

1390
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:59,200
at the same time,
 Cardinal Mai is going

1391
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,710
through old Vatican records
 and he's producing all

1392
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:07,950
of these works that nobody
 had ever seen before,

1393
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,830
that have to do with the
 history of the Church.

1394
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:12,940
Now what's disturbing
 about this,

1395
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,450
is that the collective
 efforts of both Cardinal

1396
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:21,400
Mai and Tischendorf would
 end up dramatically changing

1397
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:27,330
the academic world's view of the
 Bible from that time forward.

1398
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:31,100
During the same time that
 Tischendorf was discovering

1399
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:34,710
the first manuscript that would
 change everyone's perception

1400
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:38,070
about the Greek
 text, Cardinal Mai

1401
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:42,430
was in Rome working on
 the other manuscript that

1402
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,520
would accomplish the same thing.

1403
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,840
And that was the Vatican's
 version of the Bible,

1404
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:53,620
a codex vaticanus, which today
 is considered supreme over

1405
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:56,840
all of the other Greek
 biblical manuscripts

1406
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,590
anywhere in the world.

1407
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:03,340
VOICE OFFSCREEN: What we have
 here is the Vatican manuscript,

1408
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:06,520
also called Codex
 B. I have it opened

1409
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,400
to a very important section.

1410
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,670
And you can see the
 Vatican's seal here,

1411
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:14,020
this is an exact facsimile.

1412
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,130
NARRATOR: But before
 Vaticanus would emerge

1413
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,930
to dominate the world
 of Biblical scholarship

1414
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:27,220
the travels of Constantine
 von Tischendorf

1415
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,920
would yield the fruits
 of his great ambition.

1416
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:38,390
In his memoirs, he wrote
 "It was in April, 1844

1417
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:41,740
that I embarked at
 Leghorn for Egypt.

1418
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:46,170
The desire which I felt to
 discover some precious remains

1419
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:51,130
of any manuscripts, more
 especially Biblical, of a date,

1420
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:56,340
which would carry us back to
 the early times of Christianity,

1421
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,610
was realized beyond
 my expectations.

1422
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:03,060
It was at the foot
 of Mount Sinai,

1423
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,410
in the convent of
 Saint Catherine

1424
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:09,760
that I discovered the
 pearl all my researches."

1425
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:20,340
Tischendorf tells of how he
 discovered this manuscript

1426
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,090
in a trash basket
 inside the convent.

1427
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:29,590
The monks had been using its
 pages as fuel for the fire.

1428
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:33,280
He wrote "I perceived in
 the middle of the great hall

1429
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,870
a large and wide basket,
 full of old parchments.

1430
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:42,730
And the librarian told me that
 two heaps of papers like this

1431
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:46,090
had been already
 committed to the flames.

1432
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:50,290
What was my surprise to find
 a mid this heap of papers,

1433
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:55,220
a considerable number of sheets
 of a copy of the Old Testament

1434
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:58,110
in Greek, which
 seemed to me to be one

1435
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:03,820
of the most ancient
 that I had ever seen."

1436
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:08,280
PASTOR DAVID BROWN: He's
 visiting the monastery in 1844.

1437
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,700
And he is under the
 patronage, sponsorship,

1438
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,710
of Frederick Augustus,
 kind of Saxony.

1439
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:17,790
And while he's there, he
 discovers an old manuscript

1440
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:20,660
in a rubbish basket
 and they were basically

1441
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:26,680
using it as tinder
 to start fires.

1442
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,060
NARRATOR: According to his own
 testimony, once he recogniz

1443
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,720
the manuscript for
 its ancient value,

1444
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,610
Tischendorf responded
 quickly and was

1445
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:41,050
able to rescue many of the
 pages from being burned.

1446
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:45,240
He wrote "The authorities of the
 convent allowed me to possess

1447
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,130
myself of a third
 of these parchments

1448
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:50,670
as they were destined
 for the fire.

1449
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,790
But I could not
 get them to yield

1450
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:55,480
up possession of the remainder.

1451
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,960
The too lively satisfaction
 which I had displayed,

1452
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,390
had arroused their
 suspicions as to the value

1453
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:06,190
of this manuscript."

1454
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:12,140
In total, Tischendorf
 recovered some 43 pages.

1455
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,170
When he returned
 from his journey,

1456
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:18,110
he chose to publish the
 pages, but secretly.

1457
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:21,520
He wrote "I did not divulge
 the name of the place

1458
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,900
where I had found it in
 the hopes of returning

1459
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:29,530
and recovering the rest
 of the manuscript."

1460
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:32,390
CHRISTIAN PINTO: So Tischendorf
 published his Old Testament

1461
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:35,670
portion of the Sinai
 Codex, but he continued

1462
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,870
to believe that
 the New Testament

1463
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:40,610
portion of the manuscript
 was probably still

1464
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:44,060
somewhere inside St.
 Catharine's monastery.

1465
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:47,660
Then he says he
 returned again in 1853

1466
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:49,430
and didn't find anything.

1467
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:55,450
PASTOR DAVID BROWN: So he
 finally goes back in 1859.

1468
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:58,720
He's able to get,
 well, the remainder.

1469
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:08,550
NARRATOR: It was during
 Tischendorf's third journey

1470
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:12,020
to St. Catharine's
 monastery in 1859

1471
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:16,130
that he made his most
 famous discovery.

1472
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:17,230
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 Tischendorf says

1473
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:21,720
that he was taking a walk
 with a Steward of the convent

1474
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,710
and that they returned to
 his room at some point.

1475
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:27,280
They were talking
 about the Septuagint

1476
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:30,220
and he says I, too,
 have read a Septuagint,

1477
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:33,450
meaning a Greek version
 of the Old Testament.

1478
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:37,850
So then he pulls out this bulky
 manuscript, that was supposedly

1479
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:43,220
wrapped in red cloth, and
 shows it to Tischendorf.

1480
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,370
NARRATOR: Tischendorf wrote,
 "I unrolled the cover,

1481
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:49,860
and discovered to my
 great surprise not only

1482
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:53,860
those very fragments
 which, 15 years before,

1483
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:57,120
I had taken out of
 the basket, but also,

1484
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:02,810
other parts of the Old Testament
 and the New Testament complete.

1485
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:05,620
I knew that I held
 in my hand the most

1486
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:09,010
precious Biblical
 treasure in existence.

1487
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:12,030
A document, whose
 age and importance

1488
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:16,040
exceeded that of all the
 manuscripts which I had ever

1489
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:20,840
examined during 20 years
 of study on the subject."

1490
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:28,460
Tischendorf would
 transcribe and eventually

1491
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:32,220
publish the manuscript under
 the name Codex Sinaiticus.

1492
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,190
PASTOR DAVID BROWN: In
 relationship to the Sinaiticus

1493
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:45,830
manuscript, it's republished
 by Kirsa Blake in the 1800's.

1494
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:49,450
In the Old Testament portion
 you can see what appears to be,

1495
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:54,020
even, burn marks on some of
 the leaves that were recovered.

1496
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:58,060
VOICE OFFSCREEN:

1497
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,960
like he pulled that right
 out of the fire, doesn't it?

1498
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,090
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Yeah, it does.

1499
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:04,320
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Yeah, it does. 
 See?

1500
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:04,620
See?

1501
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,270
VOICE OFFSCREEN: So this
 certainly confirms his story,

1502
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:14,380
or it seems to.

1503
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:17,930
That they were throwing
 these pages into the flames.

1504
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:19,360
PASTOR DAVID BROWN:
 Well they were using it

1505
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,360
like we use newspaper
 to start a fire.

1506
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,070
This was old, it
 was brittle, so it

1507
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:28,340
made good to start a fire
 there in the cool mornings

1508
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,960
and evenings at the monastery.

1509
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:44,560
[APPLAUSE]

1510
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,520
[LAUGHTER]

1511
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,500
-I'm very thankful,
 and grateful,

1512
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:54,480
for this wonderful privilege.

1513
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,240
NARRATOR: Once Sinaiticus
 was fully published,

1514
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,810
Tischendorf became a
 world famous scholar,

1515
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,110
practically overnight.

1516
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:10,250
Nearly all the courts of
 Europe showered honors

1517
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:14,120
and distinctions on him
 for his great discovery.

1518
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:17,250
So much so, said his
 son-in-law, that they

1519
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:21,570
could not all fit
 on one man's chest.

1520
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:24,100
Oxford and Cambridge
 universities

1521
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,510
honored him with
 their highest degrees.

1522
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:33,810
In the midst of all this,
 a copy of Sinaiticus

1523
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:36,410
was sent to the pope
 who wrote Tischendorf

1524
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:41,180
an autographed letter
 congratulating him.

1525
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:44,320
Tischendorf even
 mentioned how an old man

1526
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,500
of distinguished learning
 had said "I would rather

1527
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,360
have discovered this Sinaitic
 manuscript than the Koh i noor

1528
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:55,340
of the Queen of England."

1529
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:58,840
CHRISTIAN PINTO: The Koh i noor
 was the famed diamond of India

1530
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,510
that was in possession
 of the English throne.

1531
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:02,940
And it's interesting
 because that's

1532
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,730
exactly how Tischendorf
 described his manuscript.

1533
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:10,050
As a diamond, he says,
 in his possession.

1534
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:12,500
And for him, it was.

1535
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:15,130
NARRATOR: Because of
 the Codex Sinaiticus,

1536
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:17,860
Constantin von
 Tischendorf would go on

1537
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:22,090
to become one of the most famous
 men of the academic world,

1538
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:26,260
and perhaps the most celebrated
 palaeographer of all time.

1539
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:33,630
CHRISTIAN PINTO: And it's
 an interesting contrast.

1540
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:36,320
On the one hand, you've
 got the reformers,

1541
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,340
who are being persecuted and
 killed by the Church of Rome

1542
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,010
because of their faith
 in the word of God.

1543
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,400
Well on the other hand,
 you've got Tischendorf, who's

1544
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:49,480
being lauded by the pope
 and celebrated like a prince

1545
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,080
upon the earth
 for his discovery.

1546
01:39:51,080 --> 01:40:19,150
NARRATOR: In the

1547
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:22,820
the scripture says, concerning
 the Great Harlot Mystery,

1548
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:29,290
Babylon, that "By thy sorceries
 were all nations deceived."

1549
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:35,750
As part of their
 Counter Reformation,

1550
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:38,350
the Jesuits created
 many fraudulent

1551
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:41,210
and forged documents.

1552
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:44,710
When they could not persuade
 others by ordinary means

1553
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:47,960
they would literally
 create historic evidence

1554
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,580
to support their claims.

1555
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:55,080
Sometimes they dug up
 old bones, pretending

1556
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,000
that they belonged
 to some saint.

1557
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:04,650
And sometimes they
 created fake documents.

1558
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:11,770
19th century British
 historian, Thomas Carlyle,

1559
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:14,790
said that "Jesuitism
 has poisoned

1560
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:19,760
the wellsprings of truth
 in the whole world."

1561
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,110
Yet long before the
 Jesuit order was formed,

1562
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:26,330
Rome herself had
 an ancient practice

1563
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,360
of fraud and deception.

1564
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,590
VOICE OFFSCREEN:
 What was the purpose

1565
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:32,210
of creating all these forgeries?

1566
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:36,870
DR. HENRY HUDSON: Well, I
 think it was enabling the pope,

1567
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:42,780
the claims-- the papal claims--
 to having absolute power.

1568
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:45,510
Anything that could
 buttress those claims.

1569
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:48,280
And that's why they came in.

1570
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,420
NARRATOR: Perhaps the
 most famous forgery

1571
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:55,390
in Rome's long history was
 the donation of Constantine,

1572
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:59,870
a document alleging that the
 emperor Constantine the Great

1573
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:03,190
gave all the lands of
 the Western Roman Empire

1574
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:08,340
to the pope as the
 vicar of the Son of God.

1575
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,550
DR. HENRY HUDSON: The donation
 of Constantine, according

1576
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:14,580
to Renaissance scholars who
 first began to expose some

1577
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:17,670
of these documents-- Lawrence
 Lavallo for example--

1578
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:20,060
tells us that that
 document could not have

1579
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:23,690
been written in
 the fourth century.

1580
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:27,070
NARRATOR: Today it is agreed
 by Catholic and Protestant

1581
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:31,680
scholars alike that the
 donation was a forgery.

1582
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:38,430
Most likely created between the
 eighth and ninth century AD.

1583
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:41,600
Developed alongside the
 donation, where the Decretals

1584
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,600
of Isidore, also known
 as the False Decretals.

1585
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:50,320
This elaborate forgery
 involved a series of letters

1586
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,360
from early figures
 in Church history.

1587
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,070
From Clement, in
 the first century,

1588
01:42:56,070 --> 01:43:00,530
to Gregory the Great in the
 sixth and seventh century.

1589
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:04,040
The letters filled
 more than 700 pages

1590
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:08,690
and were cleverly interwoven
 with real historic documents

1591
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:11,780
to give them credibility.

1592
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,880
CHRISTIAN PINTO: The diabolical
 genius of the False Decretals

1593
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,790
is that it was truth
 mixed with lies.

1594
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:21,400
And it was very
 elaborately done.

1595
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,170
DR. HENRY HUDSON: If you're
 going to the 11th century

1596
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:28,280
when you have Gratian and his
 compilation of the cannons,

1597
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:32,410
you'll discover that in
 support of papal power,

1598
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:36,460
out of something
 like 330 quotations,

1599
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:40,390
313 of those
 sources of authority

1600
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:44,480
come from those false,
 distorted documents.

1601
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:48,170
DR. RONALD COOKE: The
 Jesuits held them back,

1602
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:53,110
but they finally came to view
 that many of these documents

1603
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:55,870
were forgeries and
 they were forged

1604
01:43:55,870 --> 01:44:00,420
specifically to give Rome power.

1605
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:04,680
And so that they would be
 looked upon as the true Church

1606
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:08,650
and as the seat of the
 papacy and that this

1607
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,800
was what the church
 had written about

1608
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,050
and what the church
 supported when

1609
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:15,840
in fact they were all forged.

1610
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,350
NARRATOR: The
 Decretals of Isidore

1611
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:26,160
became the cornerstone of canon
 law during the Middle Ages.

1612
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:30,170
They would be used to deceive
 the church for more than 600

1613
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:34,190
years until they were
 finally exposed by Calvinous

1614
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:42,190
scholar, David Blondell in 1628.

1615
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:46,250
But the false Decretals and
 the donation of Constantine

1616
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:51,070
are said to be just two of the
 countless forgeries created

1617
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:53,630
by Rome.

1618
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:55,260
DR. HENRY HUDSON: They're
 all basically the same.

1619
01:44:55,260 --> 01:45:02,680
They're the same as the Dictatus
 Papae of Gregory VII, in which

1620
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:07,640
they are claims made
 about papl power.

1621
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,410
NARRATOR: Pope Gregory
 VII was perhaps

1622
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:13,350
the most notorious
 forger ever admitted

1623
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:16,820
to by Catholic historians.

1624
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:21,000
In the 11th century, he
 drafted his Dictatus,

1625
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,350
or list, of papal privileges.

1626
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:29,660
Among his 27 points, he
 declared the following.

1627
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:33,740
"The pope can be judged
 by no one on earth.

1628
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:36,310
The Roman church
 has never erred,

1629
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:40,010
nor can it err, until
 the end of time.

1630
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:44,290
The pope alone can dethrone
 emperors and kings,

1631
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:47,470
and absolve their
 subjects from allegiance."

1632
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:53,450
And, "All princes are
 obliged to kiss his feet."

1633
01:45:57,770 --> 01:46:01,640
To support these
 ideas, Gregory relied

1634
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,690
upon the forged
 documents of the past,

1635
01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:09,560
but chose to go even farther
 and create his own history

1636
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,640
for the church and the world.

1637
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:20,260
In the book Vicars of Christ,
 former Jesuit priest Peter de

1638
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:26,560
Rosa writes of Pope Gregory
 VII and his school of forgers.

1639
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,960
He says, "For seven
 centuries, the Greeks

1640
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:33,580
had called Rome the
 home of forgeries.

1641
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:36,140
Whenever they tried
 talking with Rome,

1642
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,860
the popes brought
 out forged documents

1643
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:43,080
which the Greeks,
 naturally, had never seen."

1644
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:51,740
De Rosa says "Gregory went
 way beyond the Donation

1645
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,190
of Constantine.

1646
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:58,020
He had a whole school of forgers
 under his very nose turning out

1647
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,200
document after document, with
 the papal seal of approval

1648
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,410
to cater for his every need.

1649
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:15,690
"Pope Gregory might
 require justification

1650
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:19,250
for some action against
 a prince or bishop.

1651
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:22,150
Very well, these
 prelates literally

1652
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:24,750
produced the
 appropriate document.

1653
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:29,190
No need for research, it was
 all done on the premises.

1654
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:31,880
Many earlier documents
 were touched up,

1655
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:36,090
to make them say the opposite
 of what they said originally.

1656
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:41,410
Some of these earlier documents
 were themselves forgeries.

1657
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:44,760
This instant method
 of inventing history

1658
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,350
was marvelously successful,
 especially as the forgeries

1659
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:54,060
were at once inserted
 into canon law.

1660
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:57,640
Thus was accomplished
 the quietest and longest

1661
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:00,530
lasting of all revolutions.

1662
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:02,510
It was all done on paper.

1663
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:09,910
DR. RONALD COOKE: They
 propagated deceptions early on.

1664
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:14,320
And I believe those
 deceptions continue

1665
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,470
right up into the 20th century.

1666
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:23,990
NARRATOR: Evidence that
 Rome continued her forgeries

1667
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:27,130
into modern times
 can be shown in

1668
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:32,250
the late 19th and
 early 20th centuries.

1669
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:36,490
In 1873, Charles
 Spurgeon documented

1670
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:39,180
how the relic department
 of the Vatican

1671
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:43,340
had been exposed for
 manufacturing false relics

1672
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:49,060
and presenting them as the
 bones of various saints of old.

1673
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:55,990
We read that "so far back as
 1828, this trade was going on.

1674
01:48:55,990 --> 01:49:01,030
With pieces of bones of sheep,
 and hares, or of human bones

1675
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:03,950
taken from the
 catacombs, but such as

1676
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:06,390
were probably those of pagans.

1677
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:08,900
Certainly not of
 saints and martyrs,

1678
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:12,790
whose names they
 affixed to them."

1679
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:15,870
Spurgeon went on to say
 that "The Jesuits play

1680
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:19,080
a prominent part in
 these transactions,

1681
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,210
as they do in most
 Catholic affairs."

1682
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:38,970
Then, in the 20th century, it
 appears that Jesuit deception

1683
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:42,240
played a role in
 the 1912 discovery

1684
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:46,470
of the Piltdown Man, which
 was declared to be the missing

1685
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:51,800
link that would prove
 Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

1686
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,660
But 40 years after
 its discovery,

1687
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:58,260
Piltdown was proven
 to be a hoax.

1688
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,720
The chief culprit
 in the deception

1689
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:04,140
was said to be Charles
 Dawson, an amateur British

1690
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:06,900
archaeologist who
 sought fame and glory.

1691
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:12,070
Yet Dawson did not work alone.

1692
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:16,050
His helper was a Jesuit priest
 named Teilhard de Chardin.

1693
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:23,570
In 1980, Harvard Professor
 Stephen Jay Gould

1694
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:27,490
would publish his belief
 that Teilhard himself was

1695
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:30,890
a co-conspirator
 with Dawson, who

1696
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:33,640
helped him create
 the Piltdown hoax.

1697
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:39,840
Yet another Jesuit trained
 priest, named George Lemaitre,

1698
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,820
would further these
 ideas and develop

1699
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:47,790
the Big Bang theory in 1931.

1700
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:51,130
It might be said that no
 doctrine has been more

1701
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:53,760
devastating to
 faith in the Bible

1702
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,440
than Darwin's
 Theory of Evolution.

1703
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:01,670
But was it only coincidence
 that Charles Darwin himself

1704
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:07,620
published Origin of the
 Species in 1859, the same year

1705
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:10,390
that Tischendorf discovered
 Codex Sinaiticus?

1706
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:19,160
Just as La Peyrere's theory
 about men before Adam

1707
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:23,340
worked together with Richard
 Simon's historic criticism,

1708
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:27,840
so Darwin's theory of evolution
 would work alongside Codex

1709
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:32,200
Sinaiticus to destroy the
 faith of countless millions

1710
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:36,710
in the scripture as the inspired
 and inerrant word of God.

1711
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:48,940
It's important to consider that
 from the period of 1828 to 1912

1712
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:52,900
it can be shown that the
 Vatican and her Jesuit priests

1713
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:56,470
were involved in
 fakery and forgery.

1714
01:51:56,470 --> 01:52:00,040
This is significant because
 this time frame includes

1715
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,220
the same period that Tischendorf
 was working with Rome.

1716
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,130
After Tischendorf revealed
 his Codex Sinaiticus

1717
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:46,140
he was hailed as a great
 scholar and greeted

1718
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:48,990
with laudation across Europe.

1719
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:52,440
-(LAUGHING) Oh,
 cheers my good friend.

1720
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:54,840
NARRATOR: But shortly after
 the work was published

1721
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:59,470
it was challenged by a
 prominent expert in paleography.

1722
01:52:59,470 --> 01:53:01,800
His name was
 Constantine Simonides.

1723
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:12,290
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Constantine
 Simonides is undoubtedly

1724
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:15,990
the forgotten link in the
 history of Codex Sinaiticus.

1725
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:20,770
And it's because he waged
 an open and a public debate

1726
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:23,990
against Tischendorf
 for about four years,

1727
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:29,090
arguing that Codex Sinaiticus
 was not an ancient manuscript.

1728
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:30,800
And the more you
 study Simonides you

1729
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:36,590
realize that he was a very
 important figure at that time.

1730
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:38,720
NARRATOR: Alexander
 Von Humboldt declared

1731
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,970
that Simonides was an enigma.

1732
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:44,890
Others believed
 his understanding

1733
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:49,050
of ancient languages
 to be ingenious.

1734
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:52,810
A 19th century
 publication said of him

1735
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:56,110
"Dr. Simonides is
 a Greek by birth

1736
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:59,020
and he speaks and writes
 the classic language

1737
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:06,210
of his forefathers with
 fluency, purity, and elegance."

1738
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,550
From his uncle, "Simonides
 thoroughly acquired

1739
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:14,240
the art of paleography and
 became so great a proficient

1740
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:19,420
therein that few surpass him
 either in the practice of it,

1741
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:24,490
or in the diagnosis
 of manuscripts."

1742
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:25,860
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 Simonides had quite

1743
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:28,650
a reputation in
 the 19th century.

1744
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:31,810
On the one hand, he was
 a respected paleographer.

1745
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:34,160
But on the other hand, he had
 kind of a cloak and dagger

1746
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:40,020
history and was looked upon as
 sort of a Greek Indiana Jones.

1747
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,680
Involved not only with
 ancient manuscripts

1748
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,670
but also fighting battles
 as a Greek patriot

1749
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,800
against the Ottoman
 Turkish empire.

1750
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:51,730
Which is an important part
 of understanding who he was.

1751
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:55,390
-Come, my brother, we shall
 avenge the blood of our fathers

1752
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:57,090
on this Turkish invader.

1753
01:54:57,090 --> 01:55:01,650
Let us be strong in our
 weakness and with God's help,

1754
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:03,350
we shall prevail.

1755
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:05,280
[CHEERING CROWD]

1756
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:11,060
[GUN SHOT]

1757
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:12,960
NARRATOR: One of the
 newspapers of the time

1758
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,220
reported that "the
 escapades of Mr. Simonides

1759
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:19,550
extend over nearly 20 years.

1760
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:26,440
In Alexandria, he contrived
 to quarrel with some Arabs.

1761
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:29,680
Pistolled two of them,
 received some ugly wounds

1762
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,380
on the head and
 face from a third.

1763
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:35,080
In Macedonia, his
 native country,

1764
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:38,220
he succeeded in getting
 up a little insurrection

1765
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,690
among his countrymen,
 who joined him

1766
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:43,610
in the leadership of
 the patriot bands.

1767
01:55:43,610 --> 01:55:46,470
He fell on a detachment
 of Turkish soldiers,

1768
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:52,210
drove them into a river, and
 destroyed some 150 of them."

1769
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:53,410
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 These are the kinds

1770
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:55,990
of stories recorded
 about Simonides.

1771
01:55:55,990 --> 01:56:00,090
As a Greek patriot who was
 still fighting against the Turks

1772
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:03,250
in a conflict that dated
 all the way back to the fall

1773
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:07,220
of Constantinople in
 1453, when the Turks

1774
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:12,390
invaded the ancient capital
 of the Greek Orthodox empire.

1775
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:16,290
In the 19th century, the Greeks
 remembered Constantinople

1776
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:19,640
as if it had just
 happened the day before.

1777
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,540
-Constantinople
 will be ours again.

1778
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:30,190
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Simonides
 was apparently involved

1779
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:32,550
in continued battles
 with the Turks

1780
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:36,420
and controversies against the
 Latinizers, or Roman Catholics,

1781
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:37,630
as he called them.

1782
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:40,190
Because both the Turks
 and the Catholic Church

1783
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:42,840
had fought against the
 Greek Orthodox kingdom.

1784
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:46,200
And so, for Sinonides, the
 Turks and the Catholics

1785
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:50,540
were both ancient enemies.

1786
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:53,270
And this conflict with
 Rome in particular

1787
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:56,380
would have everything to
 do with his controversy

1788
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:57,570
against Tischendorf.

1789
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,990
And then as a scholar,
 Simonides was equally

1790
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:08,000
in the thick of debates
 about ancient manuscripts.

1791
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,810
He had presented his
 work before kings,

1792
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:13,910
nobles, foreign
 ministers, diplomats.

1793
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:15,530
He'd sold a number
 of manuscripts

1794
01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:18,780
to the British Museum, and
 other prominent institutions

1795
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,810
in Europe.

1796
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:22,750
So he was involved
 in the highest levels

1797
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:24,740
of the academic
 world at that time.

1798
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:32,180
NARRATOR: Simonides owned a
 collection of more than 5,000

1799
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,790
ancient manuscripts
 that he had partly

1800
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:37,380
inherited from his uncle.

1801
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,910
As he traveled across Europe
 he presented these works

1802
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:44,010
at libraries and universities.

1803
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:48,710
Their content often
 sparked intense debate.

1804
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:51,280
CHRISTIAN PINTO: Simonides'
 debates usually centered

1805
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:54,910
around the understanding
 of ancient languages.

1806
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:57,830
And he generally believed
 that his own knowledge

1807
01:57:57,830 --> 01:58:00,180
was superior to
 those around him,

1808
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:03,280
although he did not have a
 reputation for arrogance.

1809
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:07,910
But while he was in Germany,
 he got into a vicious conflict

1810
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:11,080
with the scholars at the
 University of Leipzig.

1811
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:14,660
And it was there in
 1855 that he made

1812
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:17,550
enemies with Von Tischendorf.

1813
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:21,820
So now, years later, when he
 comes forward and questions

1814
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:23,370
Codex Sinaiticus,

1815
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:28,940
he does so as
 Tischendorf's old nemesis.

1816
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:32,160
NARRATOR: Simonides claimed
 that Codex Sinaiticus was

1817
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:36,860
no ancient manuscript at all,
 but a modern work created

1818
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:44,170
by himself and two
 other Greeks in 1840.

1819
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:46,950
-[LAUGHTER]

1820
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:49,510
NARRATOR: While Tischendorf
 was in the midst of enjoying

1821
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:53,770
his fame, the story
 of Simonides began

1822
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:56,400
to be published in
 the London newspapers.

1823
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,660
-Simonides.

1824
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:03,660
NARRATOR: Needless to say,
 Tischendorf was furious.

1825
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:08,280
-Idiot.

1826
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:11,170
NARRATOR: What followed
 would be a public debate that

1827
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:13,630
would continue in
 a variety of London

1828
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:16,080
newspapers for the
 next two years.

1829
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:26,200
In July of 1861, a publication
 called the Literary Gazette

1830
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:30,390
reported that "We understand
 that in literary circles,

1831
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:34,580
a rumor prevails that the
 manuscript now publishing

1832
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:37,760
by the Russian government,
 under the direction of M.

1833
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,600
Tischendorf, purporting
 to be a manuscript

1834
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:45,950
Bible of the fourth century
 is not an ancient manuscript

1835
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:49,200
but is an entirely modern
 production, written

1836
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,430
by a gentleman now alive, who
 will shortly take measures

1837
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:56,290
to establish his claim
 to the authorship.

1838
01:59:56,290 --> 02:00:00,240
The manuscript is known
 as the Codex Sinaiticus,

1839
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:04,560
and has attracted a large amount
 of attention throughout Europe.

1840
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,190
Should the rumor prove to be
 correct, as we believe it will,

1841
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:11,570
the disclosures
 that will follow,

1842
02:00:11,570 --> 02:00:16,140
must be of the greatest
 interest to archaeology."

1843
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:27,830
CHRISTIAN PINTO: In
 his letters, Simonides

1844
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:31,200
says that the controversy
 began over Codex Sinaiticus

1845
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:36,100
when he first saw the
 manuscript in Liverpool in 1860.

1846
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,940
And then it was
 the following year

1847
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:40,450
that the newspapers
 got hold of the story.

1848
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:44,450
So this story first
 appears in 1861.

1849
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:47,700
But Simonides did not
 publish his side of the story

1850
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:49,800
until 1862.

1851
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,990
The only reason he did so
 is because he was drawn

1852
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:55,570
in to the conflict by two
 of the prominent scholars

1853
02:00:55,570 --> 02:00:59,310
at that time.

1854
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:00,880
NARRATOR: The two
 scholars in question

1855
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:06,310
were Samuel P. Tregelles,
 and Fenton John Anthony Hort.

1856
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:09,690
Fragellis and Hort believed
 Sinaiticus to be real

1857
02:01:09,690 --> 02:01:15,040
and took sides against
 Simonides almost immediately.

1858
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:17,840
Fragellis wrote that
 "the story of Simonides

1859
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:23,170
was as false and
 absurd as possible."

1860
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:27,490
In response, Simonides defended
 his argument, as published

1861
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:32,070
in The Guardian newspaper,
 in September of 1862.

1862
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:36,140
Where he said "When
 about two years ago, I

1863
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:39,690
saw the first facsimiles of
 Tischendorf, which were put

1864
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:43,860
into my hand at Liverpool by
 Mr. Newton, a friend of Dr.

1865
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:45,000
Tregelles.

1866
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,840
I at once recognized
 my own work,

1867
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:51,880
as I immediately told him."

1868
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,310
In the book Codex Sinaiticus
 and the Simonides Affair,

1869
02:01:56,310 --> 02:02:00,510
author JK Elliot confirms
 that Simonides spoke

1870
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:05,710
of his authorship to a man
 named JE Hodgkin in 1860,

1871
02:02:05,710 --> 02:02:13,040
and in a letter to Sir Thomas
 Phillips on August 2, 1861.

1872
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:17,160
Simonides claimed that the
 manuscript had not been created

1873
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:21,720
with any intention to deceive
 but was intended by himself

1874
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:27,830
and his uncle as a gift to Czar
 Nicholas the First of Russia.

1875
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:30,760
To prove his claims,
 Simonides challenged

1876
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:35,040
Tischendorf to a public debate.

1877
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:39,610
Yet Tischendorf
 refused to take part.

1878
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:44,980
About this, Simonides wrote "The
 real test of the genuineness

1879
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:47,740
of the Codex Sinaiticus
 is neglected.

1880
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:51,270
The public were assured
 that in May, Tischendorf

1881
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:54,180
was to be in London,
 armed with a portion

1882
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:57,050
at least of his great codex.

1883
02:02:57,050 --> 02:03:00,440
I have waited in England,
 hoping to have the opportunity

1884
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:04,880
of meeting him, face to
 face, to prove him in error.

1885
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:10,300
But May has come and gone, and
 the discover has not appeared.

1886
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:13,570
Let the favourers of the
 antiquity of the manuscript

1887
02:03:13,570 --> 02:03:17,600
persuade him to come at
 once, and brave the ordeal,

1888
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:21,680
or else forever hold his peace."

1889
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:27,410
Yet despite the
 evasiveness of Tischendorf,

1890
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:29,590
most of the
 newspapers in England

1891
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:36,040
defended him and denounced
 Simonides as a fraud.

1892
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:38,800
The attacks were
 almost fanatical

1893
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,080
and often unreasonable.

1894
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:46,540
Could Tischendorf's
 relationship with Rome

1895
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:47,920
have had something
 to do with it?

1896
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:02,960
During this same era,
 Protestant historian JA Wiley

1897
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,140
wrote about the Jesuit's
 influence in English media.

1898
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:12,550
In his book on the Jesuit's
 morals, maxims, and plots,

1899
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:16,510
he said that "There are two
 institutions in especial

1900
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:19,080
to which the Jesuits
 will lay siege.

1901
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,250
These are the press
 and the pulpit.

1902
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:26,270
The press of Great Britain is
 already manipulated by them

1903
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:30,630
to an extent of which the
 public but little dream.

1904
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:33,820
The whole English press of
 the world is supervised,

1905
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:37,530
and the word is passed
 round how writers, speakers,

1906
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:40,150
and causes are to be handled.

1907
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:43,540
And applause for
 condemnation dealt out

1908
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:48,960
just as it may accord with the
 interests and wishes of Rome."

1909
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:58,270
Yet Simonides was not
 without his supporters.

1910
02:04:58,270 --> 02:05:01,630
Another paper, called
 The Literary Churchman,

1911
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:04,880
questioned the antiquity
 of Codex Sinaiticus

1912
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,760
and argued that Simonides
 should be heard.

1913
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:11,740
They said, "For
 ourselves, we must

1914
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:14,960
profess entire impartiality.

1915
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,070
Though we were quite ready
 from the first to admit

1916
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:21,800
the importance of the discovery
 of Tischendorf we are not

1917
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:26,200
prepared, at this moment, to
 say, with the Dr. Tregelles,

1918
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:30,160
that the statements of Simonides
 are 'as false and absurd

1919
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:33,960
as possible.' Tischendorf
 applies these terms,

1920
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:39,620
false and absurd, just
 now to Tregelles himself."

1921
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:43,380
The reason Tischendorf attacked
 Tregelles was because he

1922
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:47,870
disagreed with him about the
 writing of Codex Sinaiticus.

1923
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:52,500
Tregelles said, "On one
 point, I believe that I differ

1924
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:55,710
materially from Tischendorf,
 as to the writing

1925
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:57,550
of the manuscript.

1926
02:05:57,550 --> 02:06:00,910
He thinks that he sees
 traces of various hands

1927
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:05,560
having been employed in such
 a way that a change of writer

1928
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:08,040
must have frequently
 taken place.

1929
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:12,250
I believe that the difference is
 to be attributed to the scribe

1930
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:15,380
having more or less
 ink in his style,

1931
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:17,640
the ink being more
 or less thick,

1932
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:22,790
and the surface of the
 vellum slightly varying."

1933
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:26,790
In other words, the scribe dips
 his stylus into an ink well.

1934
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:28,690
And when he first
 begins to write,

1935
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:30,350
there's a lot of ink on it.

1936
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:33,330
But sooner or later
 the ink runs thin.

1937
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:35,750
In places where
 the ink ran thin,

1938
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:40,290
Tischendorf believed that this
 signified a change of writers,

1939
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:43,130
and hence the passage of time.

1940
02:06:43,130 --> 02:06:44,860
Tregelles, on the
 other hand, believed

1941
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:46,850
that it was the
 same scribe, it's

1942
02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:49,800
just that he sometimes
 ran low on ink.

1943
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,690
That was the difference.

1944
02:06:51,690 --> 02:06:55,920
But when you factor in that
 Tischendorf spreads his scribes

1945
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,440
and correctors from the
 fourth century all the way

1946
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:03,760
to the seventh century,
 a span of some 300 years,

1947
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,960
you're left wondering
 just how precise

1948
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,390
the scientific methods
 were that they employed.

1949
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:14,920
Also, consider that
 similar contentions

1950
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:17,520
are made about
 ancient bones that

1951
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:19,350
are dug up out of the ground.

1952
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:21,110
Where the scientists
 tell us that these

1953
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:24,890
are millions of years
 old and so forth.

1954
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:29,990
Do they really have the
 ability to date bones that way?

1955
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:32,850
And did Tischendorf
 really have the ability

1956
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:34,560
to date ancient manuscripts?

1957
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:41,000
After the initial attacks
 against him began,

1958
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,060
Simonides asserted that
 these scholars, in reality,

1959
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:49,410
knew little or nothing
 about ancient manuscripts.

1960
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,140
In response to one
 of his critics,

1961
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:54,390
he wrote, "Neither
 you nor Tischendorf

1962
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:58,160
possess the true knowledge
 of paleographical science.

1963
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:02,100
You have only learned to say
 at random this is genuine,

1964
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:03,680
and this is spurious.

1965
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:07,720
But you do not know the reason."

1966
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:11,440
This comment might be brushed
 aside but for the often

1967
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:14,830
repeated testimony
 that Simonides exceeded

1968
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:17,670
his contemporaries
 in the expertise

1969
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:20,360
of manuscript evidence.

1970
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:25,450
James Farrer, in his 1907
 book on literary forgeries

1971
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:30,130
wrote that "Tischendorf was
 only the senior of Simonides

1972
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:34,250
by five years and in the
 science of paleography

1973
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:38,690
had neither his knowledge
 nor his experience."

1974
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:45,920
Another scholar, whose
 testimony was chiefly regarded,

1975
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:49,240
was Henry Bradshaw,
 keeper of manuscripts

1976
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:53,540
at the Cambridge
 University library.

1977
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:56,130
Bradshaw sided with Tischendorf.

1978
02:08:56,130 --> 02:08:58,990
And once this was
 known, he was confronted

1979
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:02,710
in person by Simonides.

1980
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:08,070
In a letter describing the
 encounter, Bradshaw wrote,

1981
02:09:08,070 --> 02:09:12,340
"Dr. Simonides wrote to me,
 to convince me and my friends

1982
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:14,160
that it was quite
 possible for him

1983
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:17,780
to have written the
 volume in question.

1984
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:20,440
He had invited some of
 us to Christ's College

1985
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:22,970
to discuss matters fairly.

1986
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:26,340
He could speak and understand
 English pretty well

1987
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:30,360
but his friend was with him
 to interpret and explain.

1988
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:34,000
They really seemed to believe
 that all people in the West

1989
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,690
were is ignorant of Greek
 as the Greeks are of Latin.

1990
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:43,810
But the great question was,
 how do you satisfy yourselves

1991
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:46,170
of the genuineness
 of any manuscript?

1992
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,950
I first replied that it was
 really difficult to define.

1993
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:58,430
That it seemed to be more a kind
 of instinct than anything else.

1994
02:09:58,430 --> 02:10:01,710
Dr. Simonides and his
 friend readily caught

1995
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:04,860
at this as too much
 like vague assertion

1996
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:08,780
and they naturally
 ridiculed any such idea.

1997
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:10,950
But I further said
 that I had lived

1998
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:14,850
for six years past in the
 constant, almost daily

1999
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:18,740
habit of examining manuscripts."

2000
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:21,260
Bradshaw then applied
 this principle

2001
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:25,050
to his opinion of
 Codex Sinaiticus.

2002
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:28,550
When Simonides
 objected, Bradshaw said,

2003
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:31,370
"I told him, as
 politely as I could,

2004
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:35,130
that I was not to be
 convinced against the evidence

2005
02:10:35,130 --> 02:10:38,130
of my senses."

2006
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:40,870
CHRISTIAN PINTO: So Bradshaw
 essentially admitted

2007
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:44,630
that there was no
 real scientific proof

2008
02:10:44,630 --> 02:10:47,240
as to the age of
 Codex Sinaiticus.

2009
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:50,130
And he ultimately admitted
 that all he trusted in

2010
02:10:50,130 --> 02:10:52,700
were his senses,
 or his instincts,

2011
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:54,600
about the manuscript.

2012
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:57,520
And Bradshaw is very significant
 because it was his reputation

2013
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,830
as a scholar that
 really compelled

2014
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:04,320
people to embrace
 Tischendorf's Codex.

2015
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,900
NARRATOR: Bradshaw
 further said that "Dr.

2016
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:09,640
Simonides always
 maintained that Mt.

2017
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:14,560
Athos Bible, meaning Codex
 Sinaiticus, written in 1840

2018
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:18,810
for the emperor of Russia was
 not meant to deceive anyone.

2019
02:11:18,810 --> 02:11:21,880
That it was professor
 Tischendorf's ignorance

2020
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:25,010
and inexperience which
 rendered him so easily

2021
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:29,210
deceived where no
 deception was intended."

2022
02:11:32,850 --> 02:11:35,900
Mount Athos was the
 location where Simonides

2023
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:38,600
claimed he had
 created the Codex.

2024
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:42,780
He provided many details for how
 the manuscript had been written

2025
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:46,060
and how it came to
 be at Mount Sinai.

2026
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:50,120
He also provided many names of
 those in the Greek world, who

2027
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:55,030
he said could confirm that
 he created the manuscript.

2028
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:57,790
But strangely, most
 of these details

2029
02:11:57,790 --> 02:12:01,150
were never investigated
 either by the supporters

2030
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:06,580
of Tischendorf or by the
 newspapers of the time.

2031
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:12,590
In 1907, James Farrer wrote that
 the controversy "cannot be said

2032
02:12:12,590 --> 02:12:17,760
to have been settled by the mere
 opinions Tregelles or Bradshaw,

2033
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:21,610
who examined the codex two
 months before Simonides had

2034
02:12:21,610 --> 02:12:24,240
made his claim to
 it as his work,

2035
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:30,430
so that they had no reason to
 examine it with suspicion."

2036
02:12:30,430 --> 02:12:32,930
But could there have
 been some other motive

2037
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:35,740
that drove the critical
 scholars at this time?

2038
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:45,580
Simonides was a real threat
 to the academic establishment

2039
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:47,120
of Western Europe.

2040
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:49,960
If what he claimed was
 true, it would have shown

2041
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:53,990
that Tregelles, Bradshaw,
 Hort, and Tischendorf

2042
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:57,710
knew little or nothing
 about dating ancient texts.

2043
02:12:57,710 --> 02:13:01,450
So you can imagine how hard
 they fought to discredit him.

2044
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:04,870
Not only that, but Simonides
 was working at the time

2045
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:07,270
with a man named
 Joseph Mayer, who

2046
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:11,080
was the founder of the
 Maery Museum in Liverpool.

2047
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:15,580
And while there, Mr. Mayer had
 him come and examine a series

2048
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:19,650
of ancient Egyptian scrolls that
 he had purchased years before.

2049
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:23,590
So Mr. Mayer brings
 Simonides to the museum

2050
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:28,090
and what he uncovered were
 first century fragments

2051
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:31,550
and parchments that shattered
 some of the claims that were

2052
02:13:31,550 --> 02:13:35,100
being made by the
 higher critics.

2053
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,760
He found a first
 century fragment

2054
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:39,810
of the Gospel of
 Matthew that was dated

2055
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:43,780
within 15 years of the
 ascension of Christ.

2056
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:48,150
And this proved that Matthew
 was the first gospel, not Mark,

2057
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:52,100
and that it was originally
 written in Greek, not in Hebrew

2058
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:54,630
or Aramaic as the
 critics had speculated.

2059
02:13:57,350 --> 02:14:00,210
Also, he displayed a
 first century scroll

2060
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:05,770
that contained 1 John 5:7,
 the Johannine Comma, which

2061
02:14:05,770 --> 02:14:09,280
is a hotly disputed verse
 among higher critics.

2062
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:11,700
And this proved
 that they were wrong

2063
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:15,990
and that the verse was not
 invented in later centuries,

2064
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:17,700
as they had been saying.

2065
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:20,520
And this was on display
 at Cambridge University

2066
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:24,200
and then at the Royal
 Society in London.

2067
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:26,180
And if you read the
 accounts, these things

2068
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:30,430
were so controversial that
 some later historians tried

2069
02:14:30,430 --> 02:14:35,820
to claim that Simonides had
 sold this scroll of the Gospel

2070
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:39,620
of Matthew to Mr. Mayer as some
 kind of forgery or something.

2071
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:43,180
But if you read the newspaper
 accounts, it's very clear.

2072
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:45,810
Mr. Mayer acknowledged
 that, in fact, he

2073
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:48,750
had purchased the
 scroll years before he

2074
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:51,960
ever met Constantine Simonides.

2075
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:56,160
So there was a lot of propaganda
 and false accusation that

2076
02:14:56,160 --> 02:15:00,620
came against Simonides because
 these discoveries were so

2077
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:03,160
threatening to what the
 critics wanted to believe.

2078
02:15:06,530 --> 02:15:10,380
In December of 1862,
 the London review

2079
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:14,130
wrote that "The few
 believers in Simonides

2080
02:15:14,130 --> 02:15:18,480
represented him as a man whose
 towering genius had aroused

2081
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:23,260
the envy, alike of Grecian
 professors, German students,

2082
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:26,900
and English librarians,
 and banded them together

2083
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:30,420
in a conspiracy to crush him."

2084
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:07,700
In December of
 1862, a publication

2085
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:12,410
called The Brighton Observer
 reported that "Professor

2086
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:16,450
Tischendorf having visited the
 Holy Land, returned to Europe

2087
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:19,140
with a voluminous
 manuscript that he obtained

2088
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:22,860
from the library of the
 monastery of Mount Sinai.

2089
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:26,440
The earliest known
 copy of the Bible.

2090
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:31,060
In time one of the parts fell
 into the hands of Simonides,

2091
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:34,530
who at once recognized
 it as a manuscript

2092
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:37,290
he had himself executed.

2093
02:16:37,290 --> 02:16:40,330
He made his assertion
 public that the Codex

2094
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:44,020
Sinaiticus had been
 written by himself.

2095
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:47,210
But Tischendorf and the
 learned men of Germany

2096
02:16:47,210 --> 02:16:51,070
refused to recognize
 the claims of Simonides

2097
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:53,800
and continued its publication.

2098
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:58,370
Things went on this way, some
 persons believing Simonides,

2099
02:16:58,370 --> 02:17:03,900
some Tischendorf, when suddenly
 a Greek Archimandrite wrote

2100
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:07,750
to the English papers from
 Alexandria, corroborating

2101
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:10,510
the statement of Simonides."

2102
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:14,050
And stating that he
 remembered seeing Simonides

2103
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:16,950
engaged in writing out
 the copy of the Bible

2104
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:21,270
in question in the ancient
 Greek characters on Mount Athos.

2105
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:27,340
The Greek monk
 mentioned in the article

2106
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:32,160
was a friend of Simonides
 whose name was Kallinikos.

2107
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,370
Kallinikos wrote a
 series of letters

2108
02:17:34,370 --> 02:17:36,850
to the English
 newspapers confirming

2109
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:40,970
the story of Simonides and
 denouncing Tischendorf, whom he

2110
02:17:40,970 --> 02:17:46,550
called "The master and pupil of
 all guile, and all wickedness."

2111
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:53,220
In one of his letters, published
 in The Literary Churchmen,

2112
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:58,090
Kallinikos wrote "I repeat
 that the manuscript in dispute

2113
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:00,980
is the work of the
 unwearied Simonides,

2114
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:02,980
and of no other person.

2115
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:06,690
A portion of this was secretly
 removed from Mount Sinai,

2116
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:10,400
by Professor
 Tischendorf, in 1844.

2117
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:12,960
The rest, with
 inconceivable recklesness,

2118
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:17,640
he mutilated and tampered
 with, according to his liking,

2119
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:20,470
in the year 1859.

2120
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:23,220
Some leaves he
 destroyed, especially

2121
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:28,510
such as contained the
 Acrostics of Simonides."

2122
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:31,650
What's interesting is
 Kallinikos' mentioned

2123
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:35,410
of how Tischendorf
 destroyed the pages that

2124
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:37,910
had the markings of
 Simonides on them.

2125
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:41,390
Which may explain why some
 of the pages were burned.

2126
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:49,370
NARRATOR: It's important to
 remember that to this day

2127
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:55,420
the monks at Mount Sinai
 deny Tischendorf's story

2128
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:59,780
and his claim that he found the
 manuscript in a rubbish basket.

2129
02:18:59,780 --> 02:19:03,160
So where would the burned
 pages of the manuscript

2130
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,610
have come from?

2131
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:09,260
Is it possible that Tischendorf
 burned parts of them

2132
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:11,950
to destroy the
 markings of Simonides

2133
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:13,210
as Kallinikos suggests?

2134
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:20,020
And this might
 explain why he came up

2135
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:22,530
with a story about
 the monks throwing

2136
02:19:22,530 --> 02:19:25,590
the pages into
 the fire later on.

2137
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:27,620
A story which nobody
 really seems to believe.

2138
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:36,360
Kallinikos claimed
 that he himself

2139
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,930
had been at St.
 Catharine's monastery

2140
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:42,140
when Tischendorf was there

2141
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:46,190
and that Tischendorf took the
 first pages of the manuscript

2142
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:49,010
without permission.

2143
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:53,810
He said, "I further declare that
 the Codex which Dr. Tischendorf

2144
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:59,280
obtained is the identical codex
 which Simonides wrote inasmuch

2145
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:02,230
as I saw it in the
 hands of Tischendorf

2146
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:06,150
and recognized the work."

2147
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:10,010
Kallinikos also claimed that
 the manuscript had been washed

2148
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:13,420
with lemon juice and herbs
 to weaken the appearance

2149
02:20:13,420 --> 02:20:18,490
of the letters and to give
 it a more ancient look.

2150
02:20:18,490 --> 02:20:22,780
In response to these accusations
 the supporters of Tischendorf

2151
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:27,120
insisted that Simonides had
 forged the letters themselves,

2152
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:32,310
and they claimed that Kallinikos
 was a fictional character.

2153
02:20:32,310 --> 02:20:36,490
Yet in his book, James Ferrar
 tells us that Kallinikos was

2154
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:40,820
indeed a real person and that
 his letters cannot be brushed

2155
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:44,210
aside as the testimony
 of a fabulous being.

2156
02:20:47,230 --> 02:20:50,150
Yet the letters of
 Kallinikos bear within them

2157
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:54,250
an almost prophetic
 warning about the codex.

2158
02:20:54,250 --> 02:20:57,260
He wrote to the
 newspapers in 1862

2159
02:20:57,260 --> 02:21:01,290
that "you will greatly sin
 in foisting on the world

2160
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:04,280
a new manuscript as an old one.

2161
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:08,790
And especially a manuscript
 containing the Holy Scriptures.

2162
02:21:08,790 --> 02:21:12,940
Injury to the church must
 accrue from all this,

2163
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:18,060
even from the evidently numerous
 corrections of the manuscript.

2164
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:24,010
Tischendorf
 originally documented

2165
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:34,170
some 14,800 corrections.

2166
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:37,580
Today, the Codex
 Sinaiticus has its home

2167
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:41,090
at the British
 Library in London.

2168
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:45,610
In 2009, they finished the
 Codex Sinaiticus Project

2169
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:48,030
which was aimed
 at fully examining

2170
02:21:48,030 --> 02:21:51,460
Tischendorf's famous manuscript.

2171
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:55,610
In 2008, we interviewed
 Doctor Juan Garces,

2172
02:21:55,610 --> 02:21:57,750
one of the curators
 of the project,

2173
02:21:57,750 --> 02:22:01,700
while the work was
 still in progress.

2174
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:03,400
-Part of the Codex
 Sinaiticus Project

2175
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:07,490
is to gather all the material,
 commission top scholars,

2176
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:11,770
to go through that material
 and provide reports.

2177
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:16,190
To sit around a table and
 discuss it and publish it all.

2178
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:21,090
First of all the
 documents, but also

2179
02:22:21,090 --> 02:22:21,960
the history.

2180
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:24,680
The great historical
 account of how

2181
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:27,330
it came from St.
 Catharine's monastery.

2182
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:31,760
I think the great
 role of this project

2183
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:34,310
is to produce this
 history, which hasn't been

2184
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:38,120
written, as we all
 agree, well enough.

2185
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:44,930
So I hope in 2009, July, we will
 be able to tell the full story.

2186
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:46,500
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
 Is there any truth

2187
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:49,750
to the assertion that
 Von Tischendorf found

2188
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:54,710
the first manuscript
 in a trash barrell?

2189
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:57,380
-He said in his book that
 he found it in a basket.

2190
02:22:57,380 --> 02:23:00,870
But, again, this is
 one of the many voices

2191
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:03,150
that make the whole
 of the history.

2192
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:06,660
And I'm in no
 position to confirm

2193
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:09,710
that as being probable or not.

2194
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:12,350
NARRATOR: While we were
 suspicious of this answer when

2195
02:23:12,350 --> 02:23:15,640
we heard it, we chose to
 wait until they finished

2196
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:19,540
their research before
 jumping to a conclusion.

2197
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:23,370
Yet incredibly, once the
 British Library published

2198
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:27,240
their website, we found
 that they omitted most all

2199
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:31,480
of the documented history
 about Codex Sinaiticus.

2200
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:34,350
They ignored Tischendorf's
 own testimony

2201
02:23:34,350 --> 02:23:38,370
about finding the manuscript
 in a rubbish basket.

2202
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:41,120
Instead, they claim
 that the monks

2203
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:45,870
brought it to his
 attention in 1844.

2204
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:49,250
And while they said they were
 going to tell the full story,

2205
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:53,960
their website makes no mention
 of the four year controversy

2206
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:57,730
with Constantine Simonides.

2207
02:23:57,730 --> 02:24:01,810
We also spoke with Doctor Scott
 McKendrick, the head of Western

2208
02:24:01,810 --> 02:24:04,460
Manuscripts, about
 the comparison

2209
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:06,980
between Sinaiticus and
 the Codex Vaticanus.

2210
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:14,030
-They're different also
 in one critical way,

2211
02:24:14,030 --> 02:24:17,280
in that Sinaiticus-- or two
 ways, actually, I should say.

2212
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,330
Two ways.

2213
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:23,450
One is that Vaticanus does not
 have the extent of correction.

2214
02:24:23,450 --> 02:24:25,430
That's a very
 critical difference.

2215
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:31,400
Sinaiticus is the most corrected
 manuscript, Greek manuscript,

2216
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:34,170
of the scriptures.

2217
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:39,750
The second is that Vaticanus now
 has a very strange appearance.

2218
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:42,620
When you look at it,
 as a manuscript expert,

2219
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:45,230
although you know
 that people tell you

2220
02:24:45,230 --> 02:24:47,090
that it's a fourth
 century manuscript,

2221
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:49,500
it actually looks like a
 fifteenth century manuscript.

2222
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:52,100
And there's one very
 simple reason for that.

2223
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:57,310
Is that, almost the entire
 text has been overwritten

2224
02:24:57,310 --> 02:24:59,760
by a fifteenth century scribe.

2225
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:03,490
Not only that, he's added in
 fifteenth century decoration,

2226
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:04,630
titling, and so forth.

2227
02:25:04,630 --> 02:25:06,900
So it has a very
 strange appearance.

2228
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:17,620
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
 the reason Codex Vaticanus has

2229
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:20,530
a strange and even
 newer appearance

2230
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:24,130
is that it may not be a
 truly ancient manuscript?

2231
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:30,390
The earliest recorded
 date for Vaticanus

2232
02:25:30,390 --> 02:25:35,160
is 1475 AD, when it
 was first entered

2233
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:39,000
into the record of
 the Vatican Library.

2234
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:43,040
The manuscript had formerly
 been rejected by Erasmus

2235
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:46,940
and the reformers because
 they believed it was corrupt.

2236
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:53,890
Yet somehow, the warnings
 of the Reformation

2237
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:56,890
were completely
 ignored by Tischendorf

2238
02:25:56,890 --> 02:25:59,310
and the scholars
 who supported him.

2239
02:25:59,310 --> 02:26:03,080
They all embraced Vaticanus
 without questioning

2240
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:05,130
its authenticity

2241
02:26:05,130 --> 02:26:07,820
or considering that
 it may have been

2242
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:10,500
one of Rome's many
 historic forgeries.

2243
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:18,030
Among this company of
 scholars was FHA Scrivener,

2244
02:26:18,030 --> 02:26:20,840
another prominent
 academic who also

2245
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:24,680
opposed Constantine Simonides.

2246
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:25,810
CHRISTIAN PINTO:
 The strange thing

2247
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:29,160
about all of these guys,
 Bradshaw, Scribner, Tregelles,

2248
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:35,260
Hort, all of them who supported
 Codex Vaticanus and who

2249
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:37,900
questioned
 Constantine Simonides.

2250
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:41,440
It's understandable that
 they would question Simonides

2251
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,960
because he had been
 accused of forgery.

2252
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,200
That makes sense.

2253
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:49,700
That they would take the time
 to investigate his claims.

2254
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:53,930
But why they did not apply the
 same standard to the Vatican--

2255
02:26:53,930 --> 02:26:57,940
when the Vatican has a much
 longer and much more provable

2256
02:26:57,940 --> 02:27:02,080
history of forgery
 and fakery and fraud--

2257
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:05,150
why they didn't apply the
 same standard when they were

2258
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:09,460
examining Codex Vaticanus
 just doesn't make any sense.

2259
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:12,850
And in fact if you study
 what happened when Tregelles,

2260
02:27:12,850 --> 02:27:16,660
for example, when he goes
 to the Vatican library

2261
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:20,330
to examine Codex
 Vaticanus, the priest there

2262
02:27:20,330 --> 02:27:22,660
behaved in a very
 strange manner.

2263
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:25,680
And he said while he
 was looking at the Codex

2264
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:29,210
there were priests in the room
 and they were making noise

2265
02:27:29,210 --> 02:27:31,770
and so on to try
 and distract him.

2266
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:36,630
And he said that if he spent
 too much time looking at any one

2267
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:39,480
page, for too long
 and studying it,

2268
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:41,810
they would come to and it away.

2269
02:27:41,810 --> 02:27:43,080
Almost as though
 they didn't want

2270
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:45,880
him to have an opportunity
 to study it too closely.

2271
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:52,070
NARRATOR: Among the more
 startling features of Vaticanus

2272
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:54,820
are its many omissions.

2273
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:57,400
-In the Gospels
 alone it leaves out

2274
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:05,410
237 words, 452 clauses
 and 748 whole sentences.

2275
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:11,810
And other manuscripts agree
 that those things are there.

2276
02:28:11,810 --> 02:28:14,620
NARRATOR: While Vaticanus
 is known for its omissions,

2277
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:20,160
Sinaiticus is famous for it's
 more than 14,000 corrections.

2278
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:22,820
Many more than the
 average biblical codex.

2279
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:30,730
While Tischendorf reported
 some 14,800 corrections,

2280
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:34,310
once the British library's
 project was complete,

2281
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:38,660
the number was
 inflated dramatically.

2282
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:43,300
In this BBC documentary the
 latest number of corrections

2283
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:48,060
is given by Doctor McKendrick
 along with the theological

2284
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:50,560
conclusions they
 are said to imply.

2285
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:57,310
-On closer inspection, the
 text of the Codex Sinaiticus

2286
02:28:57,310 --> 02:28:59,930
is littered with revisions.

2287
02:28:59,930 --> 02:29:03,100
It is history's most
 altered Biblical manuscript

2288
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:07,970
and within those changes lie
 it's real theological secrets.

2289
02:29:07,970 --> 02:29:15,070
-It has approximately
 23,000 corrections

2290
02:29:15,070 --> 02:29:18,050
in all that survives, which
 is an extraordinary rate

2291
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:18,750
of correction.

2292
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:20,540
It means that on
 average there are

2293
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:23,630
about 30 corrections
 on each page.

2294
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:26,170
-Given the quality
 of the calligraphy,

2295
02:29:26,170 --> 02:29:30,690
scholars was surprised
 to find so many changes.

2296
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:32,680
Many scribes wrote for money.

2297
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:37,450
They wrote quickly, which meant
 they sometimes made errors.

2298
02:29:37,450 --> 02:29:41,450
But 23,000 corrections can't
 be explained in this way.

2299
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:43,660
There have to be
 theological reasons too.

2300
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,540
If the Biblical
 text could vary, it

2301
02:29:49,540 --> 02:29:52,260
couldn't be the
 immutible word of God.

2302
02:29:52,260 --> 02:29:54,460
What the Codex
 Sinaiticus was revealing

2303
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:56,890
was the instability
 of the story.

2304
02:29:56,890 --> 02:30:01,370
-This volume is the
 oldest surviving copy

2305
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:04,010
of the New Testament, complete.

2306
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:06,380
This is the ancestor
 of all the Bibles

2307
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:09,530
that everybody else
 has in the world.

2308
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:10,800
CHRISTIAN PINTO: So
 right there notice

2309
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:13,370
the conclusion that
 the BBC is giving.

2310
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:17,320
They're saying that if this
 oldest Bible, supposedly,

2311
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:19,870
had all these mistakes
 and variance in it,

2312
02:30:19,870 --> 02:30:23,560
then that proves it
 cannot be the immutable,

2313
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:28,060
inerrant word of God, hence
 confirming what the Jesuits,

2314
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:30,700
and the Vatican, and all
 the Catholic scholars,

2315
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:34,630
and the higher critics had been
 arguing for hundreds of years

2316
02:30:34,630 --> 02:30:37,330
in their attempts to
 destroy the process

2317
02:30:37,330 --> 02:30:41,260
of doctrine of Sola Scriptura.

2318
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:44,450
NARRATOR: This same BBC
 documentary even goes on

2319
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:47,750
to show how the influence
 of Codex Sinaiticus

2320
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:51,590
would specifically undermine
 the Protestant faith

2321
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:55,530
in the King James Bible.

2322
02:30:55,530 --> 02:30:58,330
-Here was a manuscript that
 offered unique insights

2323
02:30:58,330 --> 02:31:01,990
into scripture and which made
 scholars re-evaluate evaluate

2324
02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:06,480
the Bible that Victorian
 Christians had relied on.

2325
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:10,190
-The King James Bible, sturdy
 and black on the shelves

2326
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:13,490
was thought to be perfect
 inerrant by many people

2327
02:31:13,490 --> 02:31:15,060
across the English
 speaking world, which

2328
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:16,980
was mostly Bible
 believing Protestants.

2329
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:20,490
But the fact of the matter
 was that scholars had known

2330
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:23,240
that the translations
 were all based

2331
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:27,010
on rather shaky
 evidence, shaky texts.

2332
02:31:27,010 --> 02:31:30,760
So this is what drove Von
 Tischendorf to go and search

2333
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:34,490
across the ancient
 Scriptorius, they were called.

2334
02:31:34,490 --> 02:31:37,320
DR. SCOT MCKENDRICK: When the
 manuscript was first discovered

2335
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:43,980
in 1844, this met exactly what
 Tischendorf was looking for.

2336
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:48,020
In other words, a very early
 manuscript of the Christian

2337
02:31:48,020 --> 02:31:48,720
Bible.

2338
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:52,390
And in particular, of course,
 what he subsequently found

2339
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:56,970
was the earliest
 complete New Testament.

2340
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:59,410
NARRATOR: But is Codex
 Sinaiticus really

2341
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:02,410
the earliest copy of
 the New Testament?

2342
02:32:02,410 --> 02:32:06,290
Or is it a 19th
 century work created

2343
02:32:06,290 --> 02:32:10,110
by Constantine Simonides?

2344
02:32:10,110 --> 02:32:13,790
A work that was somehow
 tampered with and manipulated

2345
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:16,280
to fulfill a
 centuries old agenda?

2346
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:22,460
After presenting many
 names, dates, and places

2347
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:24,730
to the scholars
 of Western Europe,

2348
02:32:24,730 --> 02:32:31,010
Simonides himself seemed to
 grow weary of the debates.

2349
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:35,540
At one point he wrote "What
 then have you to oppose

2350
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:38,720
to the evidence of
 living men, O zealous

2351
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:42,240
defender of the
 pseudo-Sinaitic Codex?

2352
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:45,660
If you are still
 incredulous, I say to you,

2353
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:49,230
remain faithful in
 your faithlessness.

2354
02:32:49,230 --> 02:32:53,450
I have proclaimed the truth,
 for I will answer as I should

2355
02:32:53,450 --> 02:32:57,780
to the All-Seeing God
 in the day of judgment.

2356
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:01,940
Therefore, I have
 spoken, I have no sin.

2357
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:05,040
Wholly yours,
 Constantine Simonides."

2358
02:33:10,510 --> 02:33:14,930
Simonides would publish
 a final work in 1864

2359
02:33:14,930 --> 02:33:18,050
before leaving England for good.

2360
02:33:18,050 --> 02:33:22,190
In it, he reaffirmed his
 claims about Sinaiticus

2361
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:26,830
and included the testimonies
 of those who believed him.

2362
02:33:26,830 --> 02:33:29,250
Yet and his enemies
 in the press continued

2363
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:32,960
to insist that he was
 merely a liar and a forger.

2364
02:33:36,370 --> 02:33:40,580
The charge of forgery was
 never proven against Simonides,

2365
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:44,480
but can be traced to his initial
 conflict with Tischendorf

2366
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:48,950
at the University
 of Leipzig in 1855

2367
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:52,560
when Simonides presented
 the first known copy

2368
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:56,120
of the Shepherd of
 Hermas in Greek.

2369
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:57,790
CHRISTIAN PINTO: The reason
 the Shepherd of Hermas

2370
02:33:57,790 --> 02:33:59,980
is important is because
 it's a work that

2371
02:33:59,980 --> 02:34:02,300
was embraced by
 the early church.

2372
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:05,610
But in Western Europe, it
 was only known in Latin.

2373
02:34:05,610 --> 02:34:07,230
And yet scholars
 knew that it had

2374
02:34:07,230 --> 02:34:09,520
originally been
 written in Greek.

2375
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:12,020
But nobody had ever
 found a copy in Greek.

2376
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:15,860
Constantine Simonides
 was the first man

2377
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:19,690
to bring a Greek copy of
 the Shepherd of Hermas

2378
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:21,480
into Western Europe.

2379
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:24,390
And that's very important
 because the Shepherd of Hermas

2380
02:34:24,390 --> 02:34:30,270
is also found as part
 of Codex Sinaiticus.

2381
02:34:30,270 --> 02:34:32,610
And this supports
 the idea that he

2382
02:34:32,610 --> 02:34:34,630
could have created
 Codex Sinaiticus.

2383
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:35,330
Why?

2384
02:34:35,330 --> 02:34:39,720
Because he had access to a Greek
 copy of the Shepherd of Hermas.

2385
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,930
And he's the only
 person in the world who

2386
02:34:41,930 --> 02:34:45,830
had a copy of the Greek version
 of the Shepherd of Hermas.

2387
02:34:45,830 --> 02:34:47,080
That's why it's so significant.

2388
02:34:52,940 --> 02:34:55,190
NARRATOR: While most of
 the scholars at Leipzig

2389
02:34:55,190 --> 02:34:59,330
embraced the Hermas
 manuscript as genuine,

2390
02:34:59,330 --> 02:35:03,060
Tischendorf declared it
 to be a forgery because it

2391
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:06,380
disagreed with
 the Latin version.

2392
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:11,340
In response, Simonides argued
 that "the manuscript Herams was

2393
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:15,180
correct and that common Latin
 translations from which it

2394
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:18,200
different had been
 made not in accordance

2395
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:20,630
with the Greek
 originals but to suit

2396
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:23,950
the views of the Latin
 translators who had put

2397
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:27,600
into the mouth of Hermas
 doctrinal opinions

2398
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:31,020
eminently calculated to
 strengthen the position

2399
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:36,890
of the Catholic Church to which
 the translators belonged."

2400
02:35:36,890 --> 02:35:41,460
Simonides' biographer wrote that
 "as some of the chief dogmas

2401
02:35:41,460 --> 02:35:44,580
of the Latin Church
 were severely attacked

2402
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:48,750
by an exposure of the fraud
 in the Latin translations,

2403
02:35:48,750 --> 02:35:53,400
Simonides gained much
 ill-will among the members

2404
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:55,390
of that church."

2405
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:00,740
-This cannot be right.

2406
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:01,710
This is a forgery.

2407
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:06,880
NARRATOR: The charge
 of forgery would

2408
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,180
be exaggerated in the
 English press to the point

2409
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:15,100
that Simonides would eventually
 be accused of forging nearly

2410
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:17,510
everything he came
 in contact with.

2411
02:36:21,050 --> 02:36:31,070
He is said to have left
 England about 1864.

2412
02:36:31,070 --> 02:36:34,300
But then in 1870,
 a number of the men

2413
02:36:34,300 --> 02:36:38,310
who opposed him would become
 involved in the new revision

2414
02:36:38,310 --> 02:36:42,020
committee for the
 King James Bible.

2415
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:46,880
The committee was led by Fenton
 John Anthony Hort, the friend

2416
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:49,300
of Tregelles who
 was among the first

2417
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:52,870
to embrace the Codex Sinaiticus.

2418
02:36:52,870 --> 02:36:54,820
Under his leadership,
 the committee

2419
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:58,940
would create a new Greek
 text in fulfillment

2420
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:03,780
of what Tischendorf
 had written in 1866.

2421
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:06,320
They used as their
 foundation Codex

2422
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:10,760
Vaticanus and the
 Codex Sinaiticus.

2423
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:12,700
-It was an entirely
 new Greek text.

2424
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:15,850
It was different from
 anything that existed before.

2425
02:37:15,850 --> 02:37:17,780
NARRATOR: Hort seems
 to have been motivated

2426
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:21,880
by a hatred for the traditional
 Greek of the Reformation.

2427
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:26,760
He referred to it as villainous
 and as "that vile Textus

2428
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:28,840
Receptus."

2429
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:34,510
His partner was an Anglican
 bishop named BF Wescott.

2430
02:37:34,510 --> 02:37:37,210
Other committee members
 included Tregelles,

2431
02:37:37,210 --> 02:37:40,880
along with FHA Scribener.

2432
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:45,350
It is interesting to note that
 the committee also invited John

2433
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:50,280
Henry Newman, who was at
 the time, a Catholic priest.

2434
02:37:50,280 --> 02:37:53,640
And while he declined the
 offer, their invitation

2435
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:57,100
reveals much about the
 theological opinions

2436
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:58,570
of Wescott and Hort.

2437
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:04,170
DR. RONALD COOKE: You know,
 there's definite links

2438
02:38:04,170 --> 02:38:08,870
to Roman Catholicism there
 in the different Bibles.

2439
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:13,470
Wescott and Hort, they were

2440
02:38:13,470 --> 02:38:16,340
definitely
 Anglp-Catholics at best.

2441
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:17,580
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
 So you would

2442
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:20,030
call Wescott and
 Hort Anglo-Catholics?

2443
02:38:20,030 --> 02:38:21,260
DR. RONALD COOKE:
 Yeah, I would think

2444
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:24,610
that you would have
 to class them as that.

2445
02:38:24,610 --> 02:38:27,360
You have your whole
 Tractarian movement

2446
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:32,380
going on at that time
 in the Anglican church.

2447
02:38:32,380 --> 02:38:37,600
And that was the Anglo-Catholic
 movement by John Henry Newman,

2448
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:42,860
who later became a cardinal
 in the Roman Catholic Church.

2449
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:45,170
But he was in the Anglican
 church at that time and John

2450
02:38:45,170 --> 02:38:49,420
Keeble, and Stride, and
 many of the other writers,

2451
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:55,030
they were all working to make
 Anglicanism Roman Catholic.

2452
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:56,790
They wanted to
 introduce many Roman

2453
02:38:56,790 --> 02:38:59,640
Catholic practices
 into Angilcanism.

2454
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:04,610
And about 200 Anglicans
 converted to Roman Catholicism

2455
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:07,750
at that time, and
 thousands of members.

2456
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:12,330
So neither are but 1,000
 and Anglican ministers

2457
02:39:12,330 --> 02:39:16,310
ready to convert to Roman in
 the year of our lord, 2011.

2458
02:39:16,310 --> 02:39:20,040
So the whole
 Anglo-Catholic movement

2459
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:23,600
has been going on in England.

2460
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:26,820
And out of that, in
 Wescott and Hort,

2461
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:30,920
they really were in the
 midst of all that furor

2462
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:37,750
about introducing Roman Catholic
 ideas into the Anglican church.

2463
02:39:37,750 --> 02:39:39,400
-Wescott and Hort
 in their letters,

2464
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:42,520
they're very pro-Catholic.

2465
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:45,770
NARRATOR: At one point, Wescott
 described seeing a Pietta

2466
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:51,030
statue of the Catholic Mary
 holding the dead body of Jesus.

2467
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:53,490
He wrote "had I
 been alone, I could

2468
02:39:53,490 --> 02:39:56,620
have knelt there for hours."

2469
02:39:56,620 --> 02:40:01,560
-And Hort said that there's
 no difference between Jesus

2470
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:08,090
worship and Mary worship
 in it's causes and effects.

2471
02:40:08,090 --> 02:40:11,120
So there's a very strong
 Catholic thing there,

2472
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:14,460
as it was with the
 American committee.

2473
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:15,890
With Phillip Shaff.

2474
02:40:15,890 --> 02:40:19,290
He was very supportive
 of Catholicism.

2475
02:40:19,290 --> 02:40:21,530
NARRATOR: Philip Shaff would
 lead the committee that

2476
02:40:21,530 --> 02:40:25,020
would develop the American
 standard version of the Bible

2477
02:40:25,020 --> 02:40:29,000
in 1901, based on
 the same Greek text

2478
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,720
created by Wescott and Hort.

2479
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:36,870
Like Tischendorf, Shaff met
 privately with Pope Gregory

2480
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:43,860
the 16th and even admitted
 to kissing his red slipper.

2481
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:49,050
Shaff would become known as the
 ecumenical profit who claimed

2482
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:53,400
he was promoting the
 germs of a new theology.

2483
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:55,130
LES GARRETT: We know he was
 hitting with all of that

2484
02:40:55,130 --> 02:40:58,320
because he was one of
 the founders of the World

2485
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:03,620
Parliament of Religion that had
 their first meeting in 1893.

2486
02:41:03,620 --> 02:41:07,990
And the speakers at that were
 from all sorts of religions.

2487
02:41:07,990 --> 02:41:13,420
They were from Buddhists,
 Buddhism, Hinduism,

2488
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:15,530
these were all the
 speakers that spoke.

2489
02:41:15,530 --> 02:41:19,370
Shintoism, the bishop of
 Japan spoke on Shintoism.

2490
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:22,360
And the subjects that they
 covered was quite amazing.

2491
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:25,880
And so there was a
 mixture of Islam,

2492
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:32,780
there was a Muslim speaker, and
 Christian Science, and New Age.

2493
02:41:32,780 --> 02:41:35,140
Annie Passat was
 the opening speaker,

2494
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:39,140
who was a co-author of the
 magazine called Lucifer, which

2495
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:42,980
was a part of the
 society's publication.

2496
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:47,740
So there was a real strong
 root and connection there.

2497
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:50,210
NARRATOR: During these
 events , the Lord's Prayer

2498
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:53,540
was retitled the
 Universal Prayer.

2499
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:57,450
Their motto was have
 we not all one father?

2500
02:41:57,450 --> 02:42:01,750
Hath not one God created us?

2501
02:42:01,750 --> 02:42:04,970
If you read the historic
 account of the Parliament

2502
02:42:04,970 --> 02:42:08,160
there's no question that
 there was a very strong focus

2503
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:11,060
on Christianity and the Bible.

2504
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:15,490
But the idea was that
 Christ was inclusive.

2505
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:17,950
And so rather than
 calling for all those

2506
02:42:17,950 --> 02:42:21,820
who worshiped idols to repent,
 as Paul when he witnessed

2507
02:42:21,820 --> 02:42:24,790
to the Athenians, the
 Parliament determined

2508
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:28,560
that all the pagan
 religions should be embraced

2509
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:30,910
and intermingled
 with Christianity.

2510
02:42:37,630 --> 02:42:41,790
Strangely, the subject
 of Phillip Shaff's speech

2511
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:45,300
was the reunion of Christendom.

2512
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:50,050
In it, he said "There is a
 unity of Christian scholarship

2513
02:42:50,050 --> 02:42:51,890
of all creeds.

2514
02:42:51,890 --> 02:42:55,230
This unity has been
 strikingly illustrated

2515
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:59,460
in the Anglo American revision
 of the authorized version

2516
02:42:59,460 --> 02:43:03,010
of the scriptures"

2517
02:43:03,010 --> 02:43:07,250
Was Shaff somehow suggesting
 that the revision committee

2518
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:13,710
of 1870 was part of
 a greater agenda?

2519
02:43:13,710 --> 02:43:17,370
It is worth considering that
 when Wescott and Hort finished

2520
02:43:17,370 --> 02:43:20,160
their revision of
 the King James Bible,

2521
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:25,850
their new Greek text was openly
 condemned by Dean John Bergen,

2522
02:43:25,850 --> 02:43:30,760
who published a critique
 titled The Revision Revised.

2523
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:37,140
In it he said "I frankly confess
 that to me all this looks very

2524
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:40,680
much indeed like what, in
 the language of lawyers,

2525
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:43,130
is called conspiracy."

2526
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:55,530
-Do you believe that
 the Jesuit's Counter

2527
02:43:55,530 --> 02:43:58,210
Reformation is going
 on still today?

2528
02:43:58,210 --> 02:43:59,500
DR. RONALD COOKE: Oh yeah.

2529
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:04,900
I believe that that's one of
 the main efforts of the Church

2530
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:09,400
of Rome to undo the work of
 the Protestant Reformation.

2531
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:13,410
I think the Jesuits, they
 have been in the forefront

2532
02:44:13,410 --> 02:44:17,070
of the battle and
 they were so evil

2533
02:44:17,070 --> 02:44:20,840
that the popes finally
 disbanded them.

2534
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:24,060
The first pope that was
 going to do that was poisoned

2535
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:28,370
and the second pope, he said
 that they would probably

2536
02:44:28,370 --> 02:44:32,140
get him too, and he was also,
 after he signed the bill

2537
02:44:32,140 --> 02:44:36,570
to suppress the order,
 he suffered a long time

2538
02:44:36,570 --> 02:44:39,600
in agony from the
 poison that he got.

2539
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:44,550
But then they were reintroduced
 again by the church

2540
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:47,130
and so they're
 still working today.

2541
02:44:47,130 --> 02:44:49,420
They've changed their
 tactics I believe

2542
02:44:49,420 --> 02:44:53,360
to work in the
 ecumenical movement.

2543
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:02,590
In the 20th century, the
 Vatican would take the concept

2544
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:06,200
of ecumenical community
 to a global level

2545
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:10,600
through Vatican Council II,
 which redefined the position

2546
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:13,810
of Rome on all the
 religions of the world.

2547
02:45:25,170 --> 02:45:29,590
But exactly what role will
 the revision of the Bible

2548
02:45:29,590 --> 02:45:33,890
play in this new movement?

2549
02:45:33,890 --> 02:45:38,470
At the world parliament
 in 1893, Philip Schaff

2550
02:45:38,470 --> 02:45:42,290
said, "Christ
 promised us one flock

2551
02:45:42,290 --> 02:45:45,980
under one shepherd,
 but not one fold.

2552
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:51,120
The famous passage, John
 10:16, has been mistranslated--

2553
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:55,600
And the error has passed into
 the King James's version.

2554
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:59,920
Christ flock is one, but
 there are many folds.

2555
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:20,150
We must look therefore
 to a much broader union."

2556
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:24,770
In the scripture, Jesus said,
 "I am the way, the truth,

2557
02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:30,220
and the life: no man cometh
 unto the Father, but by me."

2558
02:46:30,220 --> 02:46:32,470
While the apostle
 Peter declared,

2559
02:46:32,470 --> 02:46:35,990
"Neither is there
 salvation in any other.

2560
02:46:35,990 --> 02:46:38,700
For there is none other
 name under heaven given

2561
02:46:38,700 --> 02:46:43,720
among men whereby
 we must be saved."

2562
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:46,940
Meanwhile, the apostle
 Paul warned the church

2563
02:46:46,940 --> 02:46:51,240
when he said, "If any man
 preach any other gospel--

2564
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:52,000
let him be accursed.

2565
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:59,470
Yet, if men could believe that
 the earliest New Testament

2566
02:46:59,470 --> 02:47:04,310
manuscripts were full of errors,
 and that early Christians were

2567
02:47:04,310 --> 02:47:08,850
unsure of what to
 believe, then it

2568
02:47:08,850 --> 02:47:13,730
could be possible that such
 bold verses in the scripture

2569
02:47:13,730 --> 02:47:17,830
are not so decisive after all.

2570
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:22,900
And hence, the door to many
 religions could thus be opened.

2571
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:32,000
Is this perhaps what
 Rome desired all along?

2572
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:40,530
Many examples might be given
 for the influence of Rome

2573
02:47:40,530 --> 02:47:43,080
in modern times.

2574
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:46,730
But among the more interesting
 is an interview with Leo

2575
02:47:46,730 --> 02:47:51,670
Hindery, the managing partner
 of Intermedia Partners.

2576
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:54,590
His company took
 possession of the largest

2577
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:57,580
Christian publishing
 house in the world,

2578
02:47:57,580 --> 02:47:58,810
Thomas Nelson Publishers.

2579
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:05,110
In this interview,
 Hindery was asked

2580
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:08,170
about what drove him
 to be successful.

2581
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:12,210
-What gave you the ambition
 to go from you know,

2582
02:48:12,210 --> 02:48:16,180
sort of blue collar jobs
 to wanting to become I

2583
02:48:16,180 --> 02:48:19,380
guess a business man.

2584
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:23,120
-Lots of demons,
 lots of devils that

2585
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:25,010
have already caused
 me to want to succeed.

2586
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:26,880
I was blessed with
 some some intellect

2587
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:32,270
that some intellectual curiosity
 as well that just drove me.

2588
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:36,110
I had a lot of my
 early influences

2589
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:37,490
came from the Jesuits.

2590
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:40,790
I was Jesuit trained
 in both the high school

2591
02:48:40,790 --> 02:48:41,610
level and the College.

2592
02:48:41,610 --> 02:48:46,490
And I always knew that I wanted
 it to be something special.

2593
02:48:46,490 --> 02:48:48,470
I don't mean that
 self-servingly,

2594
02:48:48,470 --> 02:48:52,260
but I didn't want to succeed
 and be well thought of.

2595
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:57,910
And I give a lot of the early,
 early credit to the Jesuits.

2596
02:48:57,910 --> 02:49:01,020
NARRATOR: In 2011,
 Intermedia Partners

2597
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:06,000
sold possession of Thomas Nelson
 to Rupert Murdoch, most famous

2598
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:09,220
for his ownership of Fox News.

2599
02:49:09,220 --> 02:49:13,100
Murdoch is also a Knight
 of the Pontifical Order

2600
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:17,240
of Saint Gregory, knighted
 by the pope for his service

2601
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:19,770
to Rome.

2602
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:22,840
Through Thomas Nelson,
 Murdoch's company

2603
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:26,750
now publishes the
 new King James Bible.

2604
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:31,070
And through Zondervan, he
 publishes the NIV Bible

2605
02:49:31,070 --> 02:49:32,680
as well.

2606
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:38,350
Interestingly, Mr. Murdoch
 also owns HarperCollins that

2607
02:49:38,350 --> 02:49:44,870
publishes the Satanic Bible
 for the Church of Satan.

2608
02:49:44,870 --> 02:49:49,220
But are these things just
 strange coincidences,

2609
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:53,930
or could there be
 other powers at work?

2610
02:49:53,930 --> 02:49:57,670
We considered this interview
 with the late Malachi Martin,

2611
02:49:57,670 --> 02:50:01,610
a former Jesuit priest, and
 author of a best selling book

2612
02:50:01,610 --> 02:50:04,710
on the history of
 the Jesuit order.

2613
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:07,020
In this interview,
 Martin reveals

2614
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:11,080
what are said to be the
 dark powers at work in Rome.

2615
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:20,570
-"Father uh, I've got an
 article here, entitled,

2616
02:50:20,570 --> 02:50:26,970
Two Eminent Churchmen Agree
 uh-- that there actually is--

2617
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:30,000
this is a shocker
 to a lot of people.

2618
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:35,770
Uh, there is-- There are
 Satanic practices going on

2619
02:50:35,770 --> 02:50:38,200
at the Vatican--
 could that be true?"

2620
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:38,900
-"Yes.

2621
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:42,580
Now when we say in the Vatican,
 it's at a certain level,

2622
02:50:42,580 --> 02:50:46,680
and um there's no doubt about
 it, that there have been

2623
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:54,040
and still are practices
 that are uh formally

2624
02:50:54,040 --> 02:51:07,040
uh venerating Lucifer,
 the prince of this world."

2625
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:09,330
NARRATOR: In the
 scripture the destruction

2626
02:51:09,330 --> 02:51:13,460
of spiritual Babylon
 is clearly foretold.

2627
02:51:13,460 --> 02:51:17,080
We read that, "Babylon
 the Great is fallen,

2628
02:51:17,080 --> 02:51:21,820
is fallen, and has become
 the habitation of devils,

2629
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:25,000
and the hold of
 every foul spirit,

2630
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:29,950
and a cage of every
 unclean and hateful bird.

2631
02:51:29,950 --> 02:51:32,920
And I heard another
 voice from heaven saying,

2632
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:37,330
'Come out of her my people
 that ye be not partakers of her

2633
02:51:37,330 --> 02:51:43,390
sins, and that ye receive not of
 her plagues.' For her sins have

2634
02:51:43,390 --> 02:51:46,550
reached on to
 heaven, and God hath

2635
02:51:46,550 --> 02:52:06,040
remembered her inequities."

2636
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:09,530
In the Gospel of Matthew,
 Jesus told the parable

2637
02:52:09,530 --> 02:52:13,920
of a man who sowed
 good seed in his field.

2638
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:16,840
But while men
 slept, an enemy came

2639
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:20,220
and sowed tares among the wheat.

2640
02:52:20,220 --> 02:52:25,190
The tare is said to be a type
 of weed, known as the darnel.

2641
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:28,840
The darnel is sometimes
 called false wheat,

2642
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:33,450
because as it grows it
 appears almost exactly

2643
02:52:33,450 --> 02:52:36,540
like the real wheat
 surrounding it.

2644
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:41,490
But as it nears the harvest,
 the wheat terms golden brown

2645
02:52:41,490 --> 02:52:48,390
but the darnel turns black, and
 its seeds are full of poison.

2646
02:52:48,390 --> 02:52:53,270
Jesus said, "He that soweth the
 good seed is the son of man;

2647
02:52:53,270 --> 02:52:55,450
the field is the world.

2648
02:52:55,450 --> 02:52:59,280
The good seed are the
 children of the kingdom.

2649
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:03,460
But the tares are the
 children of the wicked one.

2650
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:10,410
The enemy that sowed
 them is the devil."

2651
02:53:10,410 --> 02:53:14,870
With these things in mind, we
 ask the question, when it comes

2652
02:53:14,870 --> 02:53:19,900
to the history of the Church and
 the Bible, who are the tares,

2653
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:22,800
and who are the wheat?

2654
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:25,510
And for which of them,
 has been preserved

2655
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:30,890
the true and faithful
 record of the word of God?
