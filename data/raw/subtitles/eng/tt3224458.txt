Hello, neighbor.

21
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,432
It's so good to see you again today.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,829
Did you see the...?

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,394
What special thing I brought in to show you?

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,151
It's called a picture board.

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,233
Because behind each one
of these little doors...

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,277
is a picture of people.

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,710
Lady Aberlin.

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,236
Let's see who's behind this door.

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,871
Here's King Friday XIII.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,434
With his crown and...

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,670
mustache and beard.

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,513
Who's behind here?

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,513
Oh, it's Mr. McFeely.

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,150
He always says, "Speedy delivery,"
doesn't he?

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,036
I'd like you to meet a new friend of mine.

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,715
His name is Lloyd Vogel.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,830
Someone has hurt my friend Lloyd.

38
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,470
And not just on his face.

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,439
He is having a hard time forgiving

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,273
the person who hurt him.

41
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,638
Do you...? Do you know what that means?

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,154
To forgive?

43
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,189
It's a decision we make...

44
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,432
to release a person...

45
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,712
from the feelings of anger we have at them.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,790
It's strange, but sometimes...

47
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,950
it's hardest of all
to forgive someone we love.

48
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,470
Let's say hello to my new friend, Lloyd.

49
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Shall we?

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,671
<i>♪ I never felt magic crazy as this ♪</i>

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,076
<i>♪ I never saw moons
Knew the meaning of the sea ♪</i>

52
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,350

53
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,670

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,038

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,309
<i>Here to present this year's award
for feature writing...</i>

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,916
<i>...last year's winner, Lloyd Vogel.</i>

58
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,550
Thank you.

59
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,560
It's so wonderful to be among so many
of my fellow misfits tonight.

60
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,320
So...

61
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,552
why do we write for magazines for a living?

62
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,520
Honestly, because doing anything else
doesn't seem quite like living at all.

63
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,838
We get a front-row seat to history.

64
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,119
We get to expose the truth
that others cannot see.

65
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,237
And sometimes,

66
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,800
just sometimes,

67
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,958
we get to change a broken world
with our words.

68
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,393
Mmm. Thank you.

69
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
I needed this.

70
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,599
I ate a block of cheese for dinner.

71
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,032
- Heh, heh.
- So, what are we forgetting?

72
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,714
You definitely need more diapers.

73
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,872
More than this?
We're going to Jersey for one night.

74
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,191
We go through at least 12 a day.

75
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,555
- We do?
- Mm-hm.

76
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,074
What are you feeding that kid?

77
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,392
Would it be easier
if we left him with a sitter?

78
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,949
I'm not ready to leave him with a stranger.

79
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,440
Okay? He's too little.

80
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,956
Yeah.

81
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,829
- Hey, your sister called last night.
- Mm-hm.

82
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,656
She wanted to make sure
you wrote your toast.

83
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Oh, I'm all set.

84
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,673
I'm gonna use my speech
from her first wedding.

85
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,114
- Or maybe her second.
- Oh, yeah.

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
- Just change the names.
- Yeah.

87
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,350
And she wanted me to tell you something.

88
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Okay.

89
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,879
Your father's coming.

90
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,597
I guess she reached out to him
a couple months ago and he didn't respond,

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,310
but then he called,
and now he's coming to the wedding.

92
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Ohh.

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,475
Are you okay?

94
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,720
Yeah, I'm fine.

95
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,992
But I don't think we should go.

96
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
- Lloyd.
- What?

97
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,631
Seriously, why have a baby if you can't
use him to get out of social obligations?

98
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
This is what Lorraine was afraid of,
that you would back out.

99
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm kidding. I'm not gonna miss her wedding.

100
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,560
I look forward to them every year.

101
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Okay.

102
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,355
I think it'll be nice
for Gavin to meet his grandfather.

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Ha, ha.

104
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Sure.

105
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Damn it!

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,272
Daddy's just being funny.
Daddy's being funny.

107
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,794
It's impossible.

108
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,360
Here.

109
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,516
Take him. Here.

110
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,909
There.

111
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Great.

112
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,911
He looks terrified.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,559
He should be. He's marrying Lorraine.

114
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,473
- Oh, my God, you look beautiful.
- Absolutely.

115
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,792
I'm 10 pounds short of my target weight,
but whatever.

116
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,997
- Lloyd, the brother.
- I know, man.

117
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,390
- I'm Todd. You know, the husband.
- Yeah.

118
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,359
And look at you, you little peanut.

119
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,236
- I don't think we're having any kids.
- How did that happen?

120
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,153
I invited him and he came.

121
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,596
To walk you down the aisle? Really?

122
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,639
He offered. He missed the first two.
I thought, "Why the hell not?"

123
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,154
I can think of a few reasons why.

124
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,594
He's old.

125
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,592
And if he's gonna try to make an effort...

126
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,319
Oh, I guess it's time we get this started.

127
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,480
So, in lieu of the typical
father-of-the-bride speech,

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,916
I thought I'd, well...

129
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,351
I'd like to sing a little ditty.

130
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,196
Now, this one's for my Lorraine.

131
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,999
And for you too.

132
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,639
What's his name again?

133
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
For Todd.

134
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400

Hello, Jerry.

Oh, come on.
You don't have to call me Jerry.

Hi. I'm Andrea, Lloyd's wife.

156
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
Andrea! Of course.

157
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,116
What a...

158
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,429
unique pleasure.

159
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,199
And hello, little fella.

160
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,549
And this is Gavin.

161
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,359
What a handsome man.

162
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,189
You look just like me.

163
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,071
Yeah, let's get a drink, huh?

164
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,199
What's this stuff, pop?

165
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,078
Oh, this stuff will kill you.

166
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,278
I'm just giving my toast,
then we're leaving, so...

167
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Doll?

168
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,834
Could you give us a moment?

169
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,991
She's... She's not a doll.

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,470
She's a public interest attorney.

171
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,954
Is there money in that?

172
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,794
You know what? We're gonna circulate, okay?

173
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,920
You got a baby.

174
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,474
And a wife.

175
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,956
You happy?

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,710
- I'm happy.
- Yeah.

177
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,395
Well, she seems nice enough.

178
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,475
But, ha, ha, I mean, aren't you a little old
to have a baby, huh?

179
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,680
I'm not that old.

180
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,989
You're smart.

181
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,760
Your mom and I hardly knew each other
when she got pregnant.

182
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,275
But we were babies, huh?

183
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,680
Don't talk about her.

184
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,434
Ohh. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
You don't know the whole story.

185
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,197
- Your mom really was not the saint...
- Don't talk about my mom!

186
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,754
- What are you doing?
- Get off me!

187
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,117
- Hey!
- Come on, man, what are you doing?

188
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,160
Come on.

189
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,960
What the hell?

190
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,391
- You didn't hear him.
- You were out of control.

191
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,073
He was out of control.

192
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,800
You're just not gonna take responsibility
for any of this?

193
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,395
Of course I am. I offered
to pay for Lorraine's dry cleaning.

194
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,716
Have you ever felt the way Lloyd does?

195
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,554
So angry you want to hurt someone?

196
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,960
Or yourself?

197
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,279
I know I have.

198
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,436
When I was a boy, I was very chubby.

199
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,310
And the other kids would chase me

200
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,312
and call me names,

201
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,119
like Fat Freddy.

202
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,999
It made me very sad.

203
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,715
Sometimes, when I was by myself,

204
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,995
I would cry.

205
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,518
And other times,

206
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,512
it made me very angry.

207
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,998
There is always something you can do

208
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,720
with the mad that you feel.

209
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,870
Did you hear that?

210
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,717
Someone is at my door.

211
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,354
Let's go see who it is.

212
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,440
It's Mr. McFeely.

213
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,274
Speedy delivery.

214
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,513
Look. It's a magazine.

215
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,080
Thank you.

216
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,631
Magazines are always so full
of interesting information.

217
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,074
They sure are.

218
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,120
My friend Lloyd works for a magazine.
He is a very wonderful writer.

219
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,438
That reminds me, I have a video I found.

220
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,910
And I thought you and your neighbor
may like to see it.

221
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,076
What is it?

222
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,550
It's about how people make a magazine.

223
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,474
It's called "How People Make a Magazine."

224
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,440
I know lots of people like magazines, so
I thought you might find this interesting.

225
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,319
I think we would.
Do you have time to show it to us now?

226
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,437
Well, I'd be glad to see it again.

227
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,955
Let's look at it on Picture Picture.

228
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,835
We'll watch it on Picture Picture...

229
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,040
and see how people make...

230
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,395
a magazine.

231
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,513
<i>This is the ink they use in the
printing press that prints the magazines.</i>

232
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,475
<i>Yellow ink.</i>

233
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,110
<i>It looks like mustard. Heh, heh.</i>

234
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,996
<i>And these are large rolls of blank paper</i>

235
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,992
<i>that are getting loaded into the machine.</i>

236
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,680
<i>I wonder how many magazines they can make</i>

237
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,036
<i>out of one of those large rolls.</i>

238
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>They print the magazines
in giant sheets, one color at a time.</i>

239
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,870
<i>This machine assembles the magazine</i>

240
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,519
<i>and glues it all together.</i>

241
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,434
<i>Oh, now, who's this?</i>

242
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,957
<i>These are the people who decide
what will be in the magazine.</i>

243
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,316
<i>They pick the pictures
and design the layout.</i>

244
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,593
<i>Oh, that's an importantjob.</i>

245
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,230
<i>And these are the people
who write the words that go into a magazine.</i>

246
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,838
<i>It's a lot of work
to make a magazine, isn't it?</i>

247
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,194
<i>It certainly is.</i>

248
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,950
- Yeah?
- Pay no attention to my face.

249
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,398
Softball injury. Nothing to worry about.
Good morning, Ellen. How are you?

250
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,279
Well, this should be interesting.

251
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,591
- What should?
- Sending you on an assignment

252
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,319
with your face all busted up.

253
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,710
- An assignment?
- Yep.

254
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,792
You're the perfect person for it.

255
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,719
- You just had a baby.
- Why are you giving me an assignment?

256
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,593
We're doing an issue on heroes,

257
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,196
and we're profiling
a number of inspirational people.

258
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,479
We just need a small piece of copy
to accompany a pretty photo.

259
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,469
You hired me as an investigative journalist.
I don't do puff pieces.

260
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,156
Wait a second. Didn't I hire you
to do whatever I tell you to do?

261
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,598
And right now that's doing a profile
on one of our nation's heroes.

262
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Who?

263
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,840
Mister Rogers.

264
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,158
As in the hokey kids' show guy?

265
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,392
As in the beloved
children's television host, yes.

266
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Look, I...

267
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,797
I think this could help you, Lloyd, just...

268
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,553
start to change your image.

269
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,959
I don't need to change my image.

270
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Okay.

271
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Ellen?

272
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,280
He was the only person on our list
willing to be interviewed by you.

273
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,557
I guess you're developing a reputation.

274
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,030
A reputation? People love talking to me.

275
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,238
Yeah, they do,
until they read what you write about them.

276
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
So, what,
I'm supposed to go easy on this guy

277
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,316
because he plays with puppets for a living?

278
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,716
Four hundred words. Play nice.

279
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,949
Hello. This is Lloyd Vogel,
from <i>Esquire</i> magazine.

280
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,714
I'm calling to schedule an interview with...

281
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,154
Mister Rogers.

282
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,959
Sorry about your face!

283
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,159
You know, I got it good too.

284
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,399
Look, I messed this up.

285
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,759
I just want to talk to you.

286
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,833
- We have a lot that needs to be said.
- No.

287
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,274
I'm not gonna be ambushed.

288
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,396
Come on, Lloyd!

289
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,756
Hi, honey.

290
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,718
Hi. Hi, guys.

291
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,598
Hi, Lloyd.

292
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,080
Smells in here.

293
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,514
Bathroom trash.

294
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,751
Nine different types of diapers.

295
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,513
Hey, Lloyd.

296
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,434
Hey. What are you doing over here?

297
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,438
<i>♪ Down by the bay

298
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,241
I got it!

299
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,960
Hello?

300
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,440
<i>Lloyd?</i>

301
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,239
Who's this?

302
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,113
<i>This is Fred Rogers.</i>

303
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,271
Hi, that was quick.

304
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,151
<i>Well, I figured, if you want to talk to me,
I should want to talk to you.</i>

305
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,753
Yeah, I just wanted to set a time
to sit with you and ask a few questions.

306
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,754
<i>I'm happy to schedule something,
except for one thing.</i>

307
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,399
What's that?

308
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,551
<i>You have me here right now.</i>

309
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,153
Okay. Sure.

310
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,359
<i>On our program,
I try to look through the camera</i>

311
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,751
<i>into the eyes of a single child...</i>

312
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,071

<i>to their feelings and their needs.</i>

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Right.

316
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,277
<i>Do you know what the most important thing
in the world is to me right now?</i>

317
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,199
No.

<i>Talking on the telephone to Lloyd Vogel.</i>

319
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Hey.

320
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Hey.

321
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
You okay?

322
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,480
I got an assignment.

323
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,509
Where you going this time?

324
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,159
Pittsburgh.

325
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,038
- Tomorrow.
- Ah.

326
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,391
I'm profiling Mister Rogers.

327
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Really?

328
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,395
Well, I love him.

329
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,390
You do?

330
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Yeah.

331
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Why?

332
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
I don't know.

333
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,759
Wait.

334
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,275
Ellen is giving you a profile?

335
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,079
She knows that's not what you do.

336
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,839
I think that's her point.

337
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,200
Well, can you say no?

338
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,473
Can you take some time
and be with us for a while?

339
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,155
You didn't take off any time
when Gavin was born.

340
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,074
Not really.

341
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,718
At least it's someone good.

342
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Yeah.

343
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,436
We'll see.

344
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,395
Oh, God, Lloyd, please,

345
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,153
don't ruin my childhood.

346
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,750
- I love y'all!
- I love you too!

347
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,596
Hey, I'm looking for Fred Rogers.

348
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,518
- Who?
- Am I in the wrong place?

349
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,117
I know who you are. In here.

350
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,479
You'll get about 20 minutes with him
during the break.

351
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,478
I was told an hour.

352
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,557
You're not gonna try to fight him, are you?

353
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,272
Oh! Softball league. Play at the plate.

354
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,437
Maybe you shouldn't have led with your face.

355
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,276
Hi, Evan.

356
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,437
Sorry, guy. Could be a minute.

357
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,830
Is this a Make-A-Wish thing?

358
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,216
How we doing, Margy?

359
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,879
He's ruining my life.

360
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,235
How long?

361
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,516
Half hour already, which...

362
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,911
puts us at 73 minutes behind.

363
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,354
I gotta go in.

364
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,310
- Cover me.
- You're on your own.

365
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,154
...color of sweater that I do.

366
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,197
But I can't see colors very well.

367
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,839
- Isn't that funny?
- Don't.

368
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,156
Look at that. Look at that.

369
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm sorry. Son, he's talking to you.

370
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,879
- Okay, sweetie. Honey, honey.
- All right.

371
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,919
Don't do that, sweetheart.

372
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,636
That... That sword looks awfully sharp.

373
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,359
And heavy too.

374
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,994
- Not really.
- No?

375
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,272
Well, you must be very strong in order to...

376
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,397
hold it like that.

377
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,678
And I bet you are very strong

378
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,831
on the inside too.

379
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,675
Well...

380
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,992
Oh, I like that.

381
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,760
- Thank you. Yes, right.
- Terribly sorry, Fred. We need to start.

382
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,230
Can I...? Can I take your picture?

383
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,436
- Yes.
- Yes?

384
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,030
Everybody make sure you can see me.

385
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,635
Now. Thank you.

386
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,997
Thank you so much for coming down
and visiting us in the neighborhood.

387
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,958
- Folks, if you'll follow me.
- Okay.

388
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,554
- Thank you.
- Great job.

389
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,434
- You did such a good job.
- How often does this happen?

390
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,279
Every day.

391
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,158
Okay, here we go!

392
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,839
Everybody settle.

393
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,115
Quiet, please.

394
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,829
Roll sound.

395
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,513
- Sound speeds.
- Mark it.

396
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,920
- And... action.
- Ahem.

397
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,754
Do you know what this is?

398
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,029
It's Lloyd.

399
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Lloyd.

400
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,195
Hold, please!

401
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,351
We can't fire him, can we?

402
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,354
Hello, Lloyd.
Oh, it's nice to meet you. What...?

403
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,955
- Are you all right?
- Play at the plate.

404
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,077
Mercy, that looks like it hurts.

405
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,152
- Let's chat afterwards.
- We need to keep moving.

406
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,152
Have Evan take a look at him.

407
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,391
- No, I'm good. I'm good.
- No, I'm sorry, Fred.

408
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,709
- Yeah.
- We just need to...

409
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,916
All right, all right.

410
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,397
It's wonderful to meet you.
So glad you're here.

411
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,679
I'm looking forward to talking with you,
I truly am.

412
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,910
After this.

413
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,119
Everyone, this is Lloyd Vogel.
He is a wonderful writer.

414
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,195
Thank you, Fred.

415
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,480
- Okay, resetting.
- Step over here.

416
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,073
Roll sound.

417
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,310
Sound speeds.

418
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,595
And slate.

419
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,159
And action.

420
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,559
Do you know what this is?

421
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,996
It's a tent.

422
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,630
Let's set it up.

423
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,554
Oh, mercy.

424
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,436
A little bit trickier than I thought.

425
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,474
This is impossible.

426
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,512
I can't. I can't do it.

427
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,793
It must...

428
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,157
It must take two grown-ups to set up a tent.

429
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,557
And that's a cut. Let's go again.

430
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,080
No, no, let's...

431
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,509
Let's look at that.

432
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,638
Okay, roll playback, please.

433
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,277
<i>Oh, mercy.</i>

434
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,352
<i>A little bit trickier than I thought.</i>

435
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,439
- We could preset the tent for you.
- No, no, no, I...

436
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,160
I think this is good.

437
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,234
Yeah.

438
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,880
Yeah, I think we're okay.

439
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,274
- Great? Good.
- Yeah.

440
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,714
That's lunch, everybody.

441
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,760
The tent.
Why didn't you let them set it up for you?

442
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,516
Well, children need to know
that even when adults make plans,

443
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,718
sometimes they don't turn out
the way we'd hoped.

444
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Mm.

445
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,119
How long have you been married, Lloyd?

446
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,714
Eight years.

447
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,951
Eight year... Oh, that's...

448
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,952
a wonderful accomplishment.

449
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,276
Does your spouse have a name?

450
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
Andrea.

451
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,436
I would like to meet Andrea someday.

452
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,715
I'm sure.

453
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,076
You've lived in Pittsburgh your whole life?

454
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,637
I grew up not too far from here
in a town called Latrobe.

455
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,431
But we've lived here quite some time
and we've raised our boys here.

456
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,278
And do you think living here makes it easier
or more difficult to be a celebrity?

457
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,236
Uh. "Celebrity." Mercy.

458
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,558
You don't consider yourself famous?

459
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,033
"Fame" is a four-letter word,

460
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,431
like "tape" or "zoom" or "face."

461
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,873
What ultimately matters
is what we do with it.

462
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,836
And what are you doing with it?

463
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:57,190
We are trying to give children positive ways

464
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,954
to deal with their feelings.

465
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,439
This piece will be
for an issue about heroes.

466
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,876
Do you consider yourself a hero?

467
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,676
I don't think of myself as a hero.

468
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,035
No, not at all.

469
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,957
What about Mister Rogers? Is he a hero?

470
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,676
I don't understand the question.

471
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,991
Well, there's you, Fred,

472
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,515
and then there's the character you play,
Mister Rogers.

473
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,632
You said it was a play at the plate?

474
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,836
Is that...? Is that what...?

475
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,354
Is that what happened to you?

476
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,232
What did happen to you, Lloyd?

477
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,035
I got into a fight.

478
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,072
Ohh. Oh, my.

479
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,674
Who did you get into a fight with?

480
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,150
It's not important.

481
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Jerry.

482
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,516
Mm. And who is Jerry?

483
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,349
My father.

484
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,796
Oh, my.

485
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,712
I'd rather not talk about it.

486
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,918
Well, what were you and your father
fighting about?

487
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,276
I'm here to interview you, Mister Rogers.

488
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,114
Well, that is what we're doing, isn't it?

489
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,590
We're ready for you in Studio B, Fred.

490
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,750
Okay, Margy.

491
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,514
- I thought we had 20 minutes.
- Can I take your picture?

492
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,479
I like to take pictures
of people that I meet.

493
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,110
Then I can show them to Joanne later on.

494
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
Thank you so much.

495
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,991
I do hope you'll stick around. I really do.

496
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,074
That's...? That's it?

497
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,069
Is it ready?

498
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,680
Daniel, you set?

499
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,056
I'm set!

500
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,309
Thank you, Daniel.

501
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,520
Did she just talk to the puppet?

502
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,871
Daniel isn't just a puppet.

503
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,350
Daniel is Fred, and Fred is Daniel.

504
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,232
- You mean...
- Please stop talking.

505
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,469
- Let me know when you're ready, Lady.
- Okay. Thank you.

506
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,751
And trolley.

507
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Action.

508
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,592
Well, hello, Lady Aberlin.

509
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,478
Hi, Daniel.

510
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,389
Are you making that funny smell?

511
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,592
Do you mean that skunk kind of smell? No.

512
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,991
I'm trying to help that smell go away.

513
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,470
By squirting another smell?

514
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,280
That's right. A sweet-smelling smell.

515
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,272
- Want to smell?
- Okay.

516
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,200
- Mmm.
- Ahh.

517
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,400
- That does smell good.
- Mm-hm.

518
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,473
Where did that bad smell come from?

519
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,995
Mr. Skunk.

520
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,719
He got scared,

521
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,959
and he just sprayed this smell all over me.

522
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,272
Oh, no. Did he say he was sorry?

523
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,635
No.

524
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,157
And that just makes me...

525
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,074
so very mad,

526
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,755
and I don't know what to do.

527
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,797

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,039
Thank you, Lady Aberlin.

545
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,236
Thank you, Daniel.

546
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,640
I... I feel better.

547
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,040
I'm so glad.

548
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,758
I don't know if he's for real.

549
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,957
That's not for you to say, Lloyd.

550
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,238
I think with a few more interviews...
- No, no, no, I told you.

551
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,198
This isn't an exposé, okay?

552
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,352
Just put pen to paper.
A couple funny anecdotes.

553
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,635
Keep it simple.

554
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,191
I can't do that, Ellen.
He's a lot more complex than I thought.

555
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,351
He's a children's entertainer.

556
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,557
He's Mister-freaking-Rogers.

557
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,791
This isn't Mikhail Gorbachev
we're talking about.

558
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,696
I don't think you understand
what you're asking of me.

559
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,234
I'm asking you to do your job.

560
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,199
Now, get out and come back to me
when you have your first draft.

561
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
<i>Now...</i>

562
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,437
<i>this gives new meaning to</i> Boyz n the Hood!

563
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,591
<i>We'll be back with Mister Rogers!</i>

564
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,512
<i>We all grew up with you...</i>

565
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,319
- Hey.
- Hi.

566
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,840
<i>I see things going on out there,
kind of worries me.</i>

567
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,712
<i>I wish more people would...</i>

568
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,870
How'd it go?

569
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,720
He's just about the nicest person
I've ever met.

570
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,716
When you say it,
it doesn't sound like a compliment.

571
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,790
<i>There is... There's an attitude out there.</i>

572
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,679
<i>There's some things going on.
A lot of hopelessness.</i>

573
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,916
<i>What do we need to do?</i>

574
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,354
<i>There's no simple answers, of course,</i>

575
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,598
<i>but if we could,
through television programs,</i>

576
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,832
<i>as well as every other imaginable program,</i>

577
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,158
<i>let people know
that each one of us is precious.</i>

578
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,317
<i>It all starts in the home. We can
never underrate how important that is.</i>

579
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,077
<i>I don't think anybody can grow
unless he really is accepted</i>

580
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,756
<i>exactly as he is.</i>

581
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,837
<i>If somebody is always saying to a child,
"Oh, you're... You're going to grow up</i>

582
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,559
<i>and you're... You're going to be fine."</i>

583
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,711
<i>There's so much of that
in this country already.</i>

584
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,154
It's your turn.

585
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,835
- Yeah.
<i>- And so a child is appreciated</i>

586
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,277
<i>for what he will be and not for what he is.</i>

587
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,512
<i>"He will be a great consumer someday.</i>

588
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,240
<i>And so the quicker
we can get them out of the nest</i>

589
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,233
<i>so they can go out and buy,
then the better."</i>

590
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,713
<i>What do you think is the biggest mistakes
parents make in raising their children?</i>

591
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,797
<i>- Not to remember their own childhood.
- Yeah?</i>

592
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,920
<i>I think that the best thing
that we can do is to...</i>

593
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,678
<i>think about what it was like for us</i>

594
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,791
<i>and know what our children
are going through.</i>

595
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,976
<i>But you know what?
It's so hard once you get to be a parent.</i>

596
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,710
<i>You always say, "I will never do this,"
when your parents are doing it to you.</i>

597
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,792
<i>You say, "I will never do this to my child."</i>

598
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,554
<i>And then you get to our age</i>

599
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,553
<i>and you forget what it was like
to be this size.</i>

600
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,393
<i>You really do forget.</i>

601
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,679
<i>Well, but those children
can help re-evoke what it was like.</i>

602
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,753
<i>That's why, when you're a parent,
you have a new chance to grow.</i>

603
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,435
<i>You do.</i>

604
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,958
<i>Did you ever...? I can't imagine...
I know that you are the father of two boys,</i>

605
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,033
<i>but I can't imagine you
ever having a problem with your children.</i>

606
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,033
<i>- You ever have any?
- Well, of course.</i>

607
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,351
<i>I'm a human being just like everybody else.</i>

608
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,496
<i>I thought you would just talk to them
and say:</i>

609
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,719
<i>"Can you say, 'Good morning?'"
And they would change. Heh, heh.</i>

610
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,079
<i>But, you know,
a lot of people do those parodies, just...</i>

611
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,436
<i>♪ Well, I left my happy home ♪</i>

612
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,435

<i>Lloyd, hello.</i>

617
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,679
<i>I can stop, stop, stop anytime.</i>

618
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,753
<i>Son, what were you afraid of?</i>

619
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,559
<i>Oh, no, Lloyd.</i>

620
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,915
<i>Meow, meow.</i>

621
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,315
<i>If they get a divorce
or if they don't get a divorce,</i>

622
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,676
<i>they'll still be your mom and dad.</i>

623
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,035
<i>Speedy Delivery.</i>

624
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,276
Hello?

625
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,755
<i>Oh, my. I woke you. Is this Andrea?</i>

626
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,910
Yes.

627
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,753
<i>This is Fred Rogers.</i>

628
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,796
- Oh. Hi.
- Who is it?

629
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,280
Lloyd's right here.

630
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,874
No, Andrea, while I have you,

631
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,671
I just want to thank you so much
for sharing Lloyd with us.

632
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,753
Can't be easy,
him traveling with Gavin at home.

633
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,435
Oh, well, thank you for saying that.

634
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,713
I'm gonna give Lloyd to you now.

635
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,397
Mister Rogers knows my name.

636
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,916
This is Lloyd.

637
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,880
You left without getting to say goodbye.

638
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,354
So I'm glad we get to continue to talk.
I'm going to New York City today to film.

639
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,399
And Joanne is coming with me,

640
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,234
and we thought
you might like to come down and say hello.

641
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Um...

642
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,957
How much time do you think
I'll have with him today?

643
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,796
You're here because Fred wants you here.

644
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Honored.

645
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,913
He likes everybody,
but he loves people like you.

646
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,913
People like me?

647
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,073
I've read your work.

648
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,755
You don't really care for humanity, do you?

649
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,399
I'm just doing myjob.

650
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,233
I insisted he read you before we agreed.

651
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,275
And did he?

652
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,712
Every article we could find.

653
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,591
Oh, thank you, thank you.

654
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,236
That made me want to get up
and do a little dance.

655
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,516
We have a surprise for you, Mister Rogers.

656
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,271
We're gonna play one of your songs
called "You Are Special."

657
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,874
Well, how wonderful.

658
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,552
But how do you play your instruments
without your bows?

659
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,552
Well, we can play pizzicato,

660
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,111
which means we're going to pluck
the strings with our fingers.

661
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,560
Oh.

662
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,117
One, two, three, one, two.

663
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,239
- Hello, everybody. Hi.
- Hi.

664
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,757
How nice to see you all.
How nice to see you.

665
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,436
- Heh, heh.
- Lovely to meet you.

666
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,240
I call this move the "handshake handoff."

667
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,471
- I love your show.
- Thank you for coming.

668
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,749
That's quite a skill.

669
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,754
We stole Bill from the governor's office
14 years ago.

670
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,032
You got a chance to know him yet?

671
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,600
Love Bill. Big fan.

672
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,917
He is very protective of Rog.

673
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,394
You call him "Rog"?

674
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,475
We don't call him Mister Rogers at home,
dear.

675
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,920
- Joanne Rogers.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

676
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,070
You as well, dear.

677
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,916
So how does it feel
to be married to a living saint?

678
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,032
You know, I'm not fond of that term.

679
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,474
If you think of him as a saint,

680
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,871
then his way of being is unattainable.

681
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,676
You know, he works at it all the time.
It's a practice.

682
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,200
He's not a perfect person.

683
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,237
He has a temper.

684
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,200
He chooses how he responds to that anger.

685
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,474
That must take a lot of effort.

686
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,833
Well, yeah, he... He does things every day
that help to ground him.

687
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,598
Read Scripture, swims laps,

688
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,592
prays for people by name.

689
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,515
Writes letters, hundreds of them.
He's been doing that since I met him.

690
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,990
- Thank you so much, so much.
- You be good.

691
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,992
- Bye, Mister Rogers.
- Thanks, folks.

692
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you, folks, for coming out.

693
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,312
- My love.
- Bye, my love.

694
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,996
- We'll see you in just a few hours or so.
- Yes. Just have a good time.

695
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,515
Lloyd, I thought you and I
would spend some time talking.

696
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,037
- Oh, of course.
- Weren't those ladies spectacular?

697
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,616
- Incredible.
- Just marvelous.

698
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,395
You know,
I found out about them through Joanne...

699
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,392
Do you always take the subway?

700
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,711
Well, Joanne and I have an apartment.

701
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,757
It's just a few stops away,

702
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,516
and it's... It's the easiest way
to get around sometimes.

703
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
So...

704
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,835
you've covered some heavy stuff,

705
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,839
especially for a show aimed at children.

706
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,038
I'm glad you've had the chance
to view the program.

707
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,190
Death, divorce, war. It gets dark.

708
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,276
You know...

709
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,755
Maggie Stewart showed me
the most beautiful word in sign language.

710
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,273
You know what that means? It means "friend."

711
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,593
Isn't that perfect?

712
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,869
Who's Maggie Stewart?

713
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,515
- Do it.
- Hey, Mister Rogers!

714
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,950

00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,756
That was wonderful.

729
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,872
It seems like all these people line up

730
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,031
to tell you their problems.

731
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,152
Isn't it wonderful?

732
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,357
Such bravery?

733
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,635
Well...

734
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,519
it seems like that would be
an incredible burden on you.

735
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,080
Well, I'm grateful
for you saying that, Lloyd.

736
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,436
I'm grateful for your compassion.

737
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,400
Is it? A burden on you?

738
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,111
Okay, let's assume it's a burden on you.

739
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,479
There... There is no normal life
that is free from pain.

740
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,960
How do you deal with it?

741
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,279
Oh, well, there are many ways you can deal
with your feelings without hurting yourself

742
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,589
or anybody else.

743
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,036
Yeah, like...? Like what?

744
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,509
Well, you can pound a lump of clay...

745
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,434
or swim as fast as you can swim

746
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,595
or play the lowest keys on a piano
all at the same time.

747
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,396
Do you ever talk to anyone
about the burden you carry?

748
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,875
Would you like to meet
my special puppet friends

749
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,997
from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe?

750
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,638
They look like they've seen better days.

751
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,512
Well, they...
They've been with me for quite a while.

752
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,158
You ever think about swapping them out?
Getting new ones?

753
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,949
Didn't you have a special friend
when you were very young, Lloyd?

754
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,120
A special friend?

755
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,715
Yeah, a special toy.

756
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,120
Or a...

757
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,955
A stuffed animal that you loved very much,

758
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,354
even as it got ratty and worn out
and made you just love it all the more?

759
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,393
I don't know. I'm sure I did.

760
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,000
Can you tell me about your special friend?

761
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,634
Think I had a rabbit.

762
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,199
Did your rabbit have a name?

763
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,356
Just "Rabbit."

764
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,914
It was "Old Rabbit."

765
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,640
And who gave you Old Rabbit?

766
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,120
My mom.

767
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,238
She must love you very much.

768
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,240
That she did.
She... She died when I was young.

769
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,830
I'm sure that if she saw you today,

770
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,513
the person you have become,

771
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,432
she would be proud of you.

772
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,157
I want to get back to my questions.

773
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,269
You wanted to meet my special friends
from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.

774
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,080
No, I asked you about the burden you carry.

775
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,472
I am King Friday XIII.

776
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,478
Lloyd Vogel, the journalist, I presume.

777
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,598
And here's Daniel Striped Tiger.

778
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,670
Now, sometimes Daniel is too shy to talk,
but...

779
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,078
But that's okay, Daniel.

780
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,032
Have you met Daniel?

781
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,359
Not officially, no.

782
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,992
I'd like to meet Old Rabbit.

783
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,075
I don't want to talk about Old Rabbit,
I got to say.

784
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,038
Well, maybe Lloyd
doesn't feel like talking today, Daniel.

785
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,555
And... And that's okay.

786
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,397
Can you put the puppet down, Fred?

787
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,438
You stopped making the show
in the mid-'70s for three years.

788
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,352
Why'd you quit?

789
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,596
Well, at that point, I felt the program had
covered all the major facets of childhood.

790
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,751
And what brought you back? Money?

791
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Boredom?

792
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,354
My sons had grown into teenagers
and we were struggling.

793
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,872
We all were, and...

794
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,477
I realized then that there was still
so much more to talk about.

795
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,917
I can't imagine it was easy...

796
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,395
growing up with you as a father.

797
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,315
Until recently,
my oldest never told people about me.

798
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,713
He's very private and that's okay.

799
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,397
And my youngest son, he...

800
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,711
He genuinely tested me.

801
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,274
But, eventually, we found our way,
and now I'm very proud of both of them.

802
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,799
But you are right, Lloyd.

803
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,640
It couldn't have been easy on them.

804
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,910
Thank you.

805
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,395
Thank you for that perspective.

806
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,436
You're welcome.

807
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,950
Is that not the answer you were hoping for?

808
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,432
Being a parent
does not mean being a perfect parent?

809
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,276
You might be experiencing some of that now
with your son.

810
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,960
And...

811
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,472
I've been thinking a lot
about you and your father.

812
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,470
Did you work out your disagreement?

813
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,153
This is ridiculous.

814
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,639
- Lloyd, where are you going?
- We're done. Thanks. Been a real pleasure.

815
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Mercy.

816
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,720
Heh, heh. He's so quiet with you.

817
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,600
I'm good with babies.

818
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,716
Aren't I?

819
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,389
Hey, hey!

820
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,636
Come on, sit down.
We... We cooked you some takeout.

821
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,949
They brought pizza.

822
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,354
Lloyd, this is Dorothy.

823
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,200
Hello.

824
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,678
Can't you just say hello?

825
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,234
Where's your manners?

826
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,836
I'm sorry.

827
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,149
I think we should go.

828
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,756
I had an idea, okay?

829
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,960
Maybe we'd eat some food,
we'd talk like people.

830
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,436
I messed things up at the wedding.

831
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,634
Of course, you know, you didn't help, but...

832
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,760
I get it.

833
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,471
And you let me sit out there in my car
on the street for two nights...

834
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,360
like I'm homeless,
like I'm some kind of a bum.

835
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,518
- Jerry, you're not helping.
- Well, he won't say a word.

836
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,592
You came here to introduce me to her?

837
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,874
Yeah.

838
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,030
To Dorothy.

839
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Hi, Dorothy.

840
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Hi, Lloyd.

841
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,992
Okay, you did what you came here to do.
Now I want you to leave.

842
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
Lloyd.

843
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,593
I may never come back here.

844
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,519
So, please, listen to me.

845
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:45,071
Dorothy and I have been together and in love
for 15 years.

846
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,720
He left as soon as Mom got sick.

847
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,616
Did you know that?
Couldn't even wait for her to die.

848
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,896
She really didn't want me there.

849
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,674
Because you were sleeping around
while she was dying.

850
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
I know.

851
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,870
I know it!

852
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,630
Took me years to get myself together.

853
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,274
Dorothy's why I'm standing here.

854
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,075
She helped me grow the hell up!

855
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,359
You know what they tell you about people
when they're dying?

856
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,909
They tell you it's peaceful,
that they just slip away.

857
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,198
Mom screamed... when she went.
Did you know that?

858
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,635
She screamed until she passed out.

859
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,430
And then they came in and revived her,
and she went right back to it.

860
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,997
It was just me, Lorraine and the nurses.

861
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,552
Sign the paperwork, pack up the house,
put her in the ground.

862
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,597
- Jerry?
- Come on, Lloyd.

863
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,470
Oh, God, myjaw.

864
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,480
Jerry?

865
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,195
Jerry.

866
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,753
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

867
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,639
I'll call 911. Lloyd, do something!

868
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,360
Just breathe. Breathe. Look at me.

869
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,471
- Hello?
- I'm right here.

870
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,631
Yes, we have a man who's collapsed.

871
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,879
Yeah, we don't know.
I don't... Is he breathing?

872
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,237
- Yeah.
- He's breathing. Yes. He's breathing.

873
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,073
It may be a heart attack.

874
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,594
Lloyd, do something!

875
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,030
The cardiac MRI revealed
more extensive stenosis than we thought.

876
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,034
An operation at this time,
the risk of infection alone...

877
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,840
You ready to sleep?

878
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,155
Had enough? You good?

879
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,833
Okay, come on.

880
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,800
Know anything?

881
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,155
I hate hospitals.

882
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,831
You should go home and get him to bed.

883
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,956
No.

884
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,838
I don't want to leave you here.

885
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,149
I'm not staying here.

886
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,280
Okay.

887
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,393
Let's all go together.

888
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,600
No, I have to go to Pittsburgh.

889
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,832
- Right now?
- Yeah, I have to work.

890
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,400
With your dad like this?

891
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,800
I have a deadline.

892
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,157
I'm sure Ellen would understand
if you tell her what's happening.

893
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,360
I don't want to. I... I wanna go
to Pittsburgh. I wanna do myjob.

894
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,638
- This shouldn't be a surprise to you.
- Hey, don't talk to me like that.

895
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,496
You seem to think
that now that we have a kid,

896
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,160
I shouldn't care about all the things
I have always cared about

897
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,356
because you don't anymore.

898
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,999
I still care about my work.

899
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,551
I have never asked you
to stop caring about your work.

900
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,915
- I've gotta go.
- Why?

901
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,840
Everyone who's important
is in this hospital right now.

902
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,310
Can't you be on my side?

903
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,153
For once?

904
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,509
You used to be on my side.

905
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,671
I am telling you this
because I am on your side.

906
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,117
Now is not the time to go to work.

907
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,473
I've... I've gotta go
if I'm gonna make Pittsburgh by morning.

908
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,759
Fine. I'm gonna go sit with your family
while you go.

909
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,640
Pittsburgh?

910
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,954
- Lloyd, there you are.
- I... I need to talk to Fred.

911
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,760
Very funny, mister.
Get over there. We're ready to shoot.

912
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,276
Right this way.

913
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,555
Come here.

914
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,599
- Quiet, please.
- What? What am I doing here?

915
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,559
Well, you're in this episode, of course.
Just wait there.

916
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,074
- Roll sound.
- Sound speeds.

917
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,913
- What...?
- And slate.

918
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,673
And action!

919
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,559
Oh, it's my good friend, Lloyd.

920
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,553
Lloyd Vogel. You remember Lloyd.

921
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,678
Fred, I don't understand what's going on.
Can we stop? Can we stop?

922
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,190
Are...? Are you feeling unwell, Lloyd?

923
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,920
Stop asking me questions.
I ask you the questions.

924
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,677
On today's program,
I thought we would talk about hospitals.

925
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,719
Sometimes, when somebody is sick,

926
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,713
they have to go to a hospital.

927
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,519
I hate hospitals.

928
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,910
A hospital is a place where people go.

929
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,920
Okay.

930
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:34,595
Would you like to pretend
you're in a hospital?

931
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,680
No!

932
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,476
- Hello, Old Rabbit.
- What?

933
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,553
Old Rabbit, I presume.

934
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,633
I'm not... I don't... Where's...? Where's Fred?

935
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,677
I've been waiting to meet you, Old Rabbit.

936
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,958
I'm so happy you came for a visit.

937
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,196
Hello, Lady Aberlin.

938
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,600
Well, hello.

939
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,395
Hello, Old Rabbit.

940
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,233
- Oh, my God.
- We were discussing hospitals.

941
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,439
Well, a hospital is where you go
when your body is hurt.

942
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,070
But what do you do
when your feelings are hurt?

943
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,756
Why, you talk about them.

944
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,354

945
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,275

Do you remember?

957
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,278
Did something happen?

958
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,396
Hey, peanut.

959
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,230
Hi, Mom.

960
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,995
I know you think you're doing this for me...

961
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,197
holding on to this anger.

962
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,158
I don't need it.

963
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,396
<i>Lloyd?</i>

964
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,036
Lloyd?

965
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,952
- What happened?
- I don't know.

966
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,918
- He just... He just collapsed.
- Is he okay?

967
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,080
- Can somebody get...?
- I'll get help.

968
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,990
Turn.

969
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,433
Oh, good.

970
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,636
You're awake.

971
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,077
Oh, my goodness. If I knew you were there,
I would have stopped all this noise.

972
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,631
No, no, no, that was... It was beautiful.

973
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:24,554
Now, you must be very hungry, Lloyd.
Let me get my jacket, and we'll go out.

974
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,869
I... I should go.

975
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,429
Oh, no, no. Nonsense, nonsense.

976
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:41,117
Oh, look at this. Thank you so much.

977
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,200
Enjoy.

978
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:43,429
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

979
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,360
Are you a vegetarian?

980
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,113
I just can't imagine eating...

981
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,953
anything with a mother.

982
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,236
Bill was right.

983
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,840
You...

984
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,752
love people like me.

985
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,959
What are people like you?

986
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,597
I've never met anyone like you
in my entire life.

987
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,995
Broken people.

988
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,359
I don't think you are broken.

989
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,398
I know you are a man of conviction.

990
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,714
A person who knows the difference
between what is wrong and what is right.

991
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,954
Try to remember
that your relationship with your father...

992
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,271
also helped to shape those parts.

993
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,910
He helped you become what you are.

994
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,397
Would you do something with me, Lloyd?

995
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,634
It's an exercise I like to do sometimes.

996
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,118
We'll just take a minute

997
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:22,110
and think about all the people
who loved us into being.

998
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,678
I... I can't do that.

999
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,959
They will come to you.

1000
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,316
Just one minute of silence.

1001
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,077
Thank you for doing that with me.

1002
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,874
I feel so much better.

1003
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,359
So the way I left...

1004
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,556
Was messed up.

1005
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,673
- Yes, I should have called you.
- You shouldn't have left.

1006
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,518
The doctor came out to speak to you.
I didn't know what to tell her.

1007
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,637
I really didn't know what to tell your dad.

1008
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,560
And on top of that,
I tried to get a cab home.

1009
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,270
Of course, I couldn't get one,
so I had to take the train at midnight.

1010
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,474
People were looking at me with Gavin like...

1011
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,751
someone was gonna call Child Services.

1012
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,512
I know you're trying to apologize,
but that doesn't mean it gets to be easy.

1013
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,834
Okay, talk.

1014
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,920
Can...?

1015
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,310
Can we sit?

1016
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,076
Is he down?

1017
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,360
Finally.

1018
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,320
Listen.

1019
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,271
I... I realize
I need to deal with my feelings.

1020
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,917
When I'm scared...

1021
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,835
Which I was in the hospital,
and I have been...

1022
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,199
for a long time.

1023
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,759
...I get really angry.

1024
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,920
And I know it's a way of saying,
"I can't deal with this.

1025
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,754
Get away from me."
But that's not what I want.

1026
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,640
It's actually the opposite of what I want.

1027
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,594
You and Gavin...

1028
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,713
you're what I want.

1029
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,150
I'm sorry.

1030
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,712
I have to go and see Jerry.

1031
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,750
He's dying.

1032
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,840
I know.

1033
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,359
My dad is dying.

1051
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,310
Thank you, God.

1052
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,392
He still eats like a teenager.

1053
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,196
Cold cuts, sugar cereal.

1054
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,515
Stubborn goat.

1055
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,798
At least you come by it honestly.

1056
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,958
Did you know about me...

1057
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,474
and my sister?

1058
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,316
Not... Not until very recently.

1059
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,520
What about my mom?

1060
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,315
When he got sick last year,

1061
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,358
after the first episode, he...

1062
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,916
He started to talk

1063
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,710
and tell me things
that I wish he'd told me a long time ago.

1064
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,591
<i>Whose one-day cash winnings total...</i>

1065
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,637

1066
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:55,953
<i>- And now, here is the host of</i> Jeopardy!
- I mean, someone should drink it.

1067
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,116
No, thanks.

1068
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,960
Not even beer?

1069
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,834
Oh, do you have...? Yeah, yeah, I'll...
I'll drink a beer if it'll make you happy.

1070
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,149
No, we don't have beer.

1071
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,001
Don't do it because it'd make me happy.
Do it because you wanna do it.

1072
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,316
You don't have a beer,
and I don't want a beer, so...

1073
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,278
So don't drink anything.

1074
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,477
Just dehydrate.

1075
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,679
Sorry.

1076
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:29,118
I definitely broke the Pack 'n Play.
It just snapped like a chicken bone.

1077
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,200
No.

1078
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,918
- How's he doing?
- He seems fine.

1079
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
- Yeah?
- I don't know.

1080
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,760
They don't put a hospital bed
in your living room if you're fine.

1081
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,437
Hey. Thank you for coming.

1082
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,954

You wish it was your mom
who was awake right now. I know.

1088
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,550
But we're gonna let her sleep, okay?

1089
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,072

It's 4 in the morning.

You don't sleep either, do you?

1108
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,952
I never did this with you.

1109
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,877
Up in the middle of the night
doing the... mom thing.

1110
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,719
It's not a mom thing.

1111
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,840
You know what I mean.

1112
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,869
You should rest.

1113
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,951
No. Hey.

1114
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,156
Come on, stay.

1115
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,280
Hey.

1116
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,237
Right over there.

1117
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,080
What?

1118
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,992
Just grab two glasses.

1119
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,831
I don't think that's the best idea.

1120
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,795
How would you know? You don't drink.

1121
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,040
Come on.

1122
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,913
Now we're talking.

1123
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,880
Cheers.

1124
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,960
Lloyd...

1125
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,638
I am sorry for leaving you and your sister.

1126
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It was...

1127
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,474
It was selfish.

1128
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,879
And it was cruel.

1129
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,156
Will you look at me?

1130
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,431
I am so sorry, son.

1131
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,154
It's not fair, you know?

1132
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,596
I think...

1133
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,791
I'm just now
starting to figure out how to live my life.

1134
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,196
I always loved you.

1135
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,555
I love you too...

1136
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,920
Dad.

1137
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,874
Hey.

1138
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,712
- Hm.
- What?

1139
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,596
It's stupid.

1140
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,878
It's like 10,000 words.

1141
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:18,960
Yeah.

1142
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,195
It's not really about Mister Rogers.

1143
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,114
- I know.
- I mean, it is, but...

1144
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,600
it's so you.

1145
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,790
You never talk about this stuff.

1146
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,040
Nope.

1147
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,070
It's good.

1148
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,631
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1149
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,315
Lloyd, I love it.

1150
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,798
- You do?
- Yes. It's gonna be the cover.

1151
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,953
Right off the bat, about the wedding...

1152
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,231
Whatever.
It was the most entertaining one yet.

1153
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,239
I'm just glad you're here.

1154
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,792
Don't go to Martha's Vineyard.

1155
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,556
- Why not? It's my honeymoon. I deserve it.
- Absolutely, you do.

1156
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,216
No, it's not a question of entitlement.
You're not gonna like it.

1157
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,914
It's a bunch of rich jerks.
And it's freezing.

1158
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,356
You're gonna freeze to death
with a bunch of rich jerks.

1159
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,115
Who's here?

1160
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,869
Ah. I'm in the right place.

1161
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,474
- Come on in.
- Lloyd.

1162
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,312
Holy crap.

1163
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,675
- Andrea.
- Hi, Fred.

1164
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,116
Such a pleasure to finally see you.

1165
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,396
- Can I take this for you?
- Oh, thank you. Yes.

1166
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,994
Hello, Mister Rogers.

1167
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,560
Hello.

1168
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,280
Hello there.

1169
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,396
Hi, Gavin.

1170
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,678
Hello. I hope you and I
can be friends someday.

1171
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,554
Mr. Vogel.

1172
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,315
May I call you Jerry?

1173
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,595
Yes, sir.

1174
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,239
You certainly may.

1175
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,670
Lloyd, Joanne adored your article, as did I.

1176
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,677
Andrea, are you feeling better
about day care?

1177
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:15,600
A little.

1178
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,280
Maybe.

1179
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,914
What? You're not the only one
who talks to Fred.

1180
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,835
Mister Rogers,
is it true you're a sharpshooter?

1181
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,716
Navy SEAL.

1182
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,598
No, I'm afraid not.

1183
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:38,037
What the hell kind of insane question
was that?

1184
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,120
I heard it.

1185
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,231
Andrea, where'd you guys go
on your honeymoon?

1186
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,594
Well, we eloped in Maui,
so we were kind of already on our honeymoon.

1187
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,990
- I would've gone.
- You weren't invited.

1188
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:53,078
Hey. Lloyd, he's embarrassed by us.

1189
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,434
I'm kidding.

1190
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,520
I know.

1191
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,720
Maybe we should do a family vacation.

1192
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,234
What do you think about that, Dad?

1193
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,198
Should we dip our toes in the ocean
together?

1194
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,953
Oh, that sounds so nice.

1195
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,599
Crash your honeymoon?

1196
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,074
Count me in.

1197
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,674
If I'm still here.

1198
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,994
You know,

1199
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:38,030
death is something
many of us are uncomfortable speaking about.

1200
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,551
But to die is to be human.

1201
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,837
And anything human is mentionable.

1202
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,277
Anything mentionable is manageable.

1203
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,916
Anything mentionable is manageable.

1204
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,874
You got to send me a copy.

1205
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,118
Joanne will love this when she sees it.

1206
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,276
It'd be so much cooler if he was in this.

1207
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,071
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1208
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,560
I should get going.

1209
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,756
I'll walk you out.

1210
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,840
I got these.

1211
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,156
Count on it.

1212
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,200
Thank you.

1213
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,200
Hey. What...?

1214
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,079
What did you say to Jerry?

1215
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,470
I asked him to pray for me.

1216
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,513
I figure anyone who is going through
what he is going through

1217
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,637
must be awfully close to God.

1218
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,397
- Lloyd.
- Bill.

1219
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,075

01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,240

What do you mean?

1233

Stay home with Gavin.
