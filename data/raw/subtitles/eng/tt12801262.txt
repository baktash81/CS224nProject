2
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,886
Listen, Tommaso,

3
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,764
do we really need to fish near the island?

4
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,975
- Eh, you worry too much.
- I don't know.

5
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,102
What if the old stories are true?

6
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,687
Oh, come on, Giacomo.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,939
You really believe in sea monsters?

8
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,859
Too many strange things have
been seen in these waters.

9
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,527
They're all just stories.

10
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,488
Tall tales to keep us away
from a great fishing spot.

11
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,365
- But, Tommaso...
- We're fine.

12
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,707
Ah, that's more like it.

13
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,110
What is that?

14
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,179
You missed. Let's go,

15
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,972
before it comes back for us.

16
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,557
I told you they were real.

17
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,018
Oh, what a monster!

18
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,728
Horrifying!

19
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,322
Fish out of the barn!
Fish out of the barn!

20
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,115
No, no, no!

21
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,742
Mom's gonna kill me!

22
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,536
Caterina!

23
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
Wait!

24
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,916
Whoa!

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,668
Oh, good morning, Mr. Branzino.

26
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,628
And also, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,004
Well, how's Mrs. Branzino?

28
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,172
Hi, Luca.

29
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,430
Excuse me, ma'am. Have you...

30
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,723
Yes.

31
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,188
Giuseppe, get back here!

32
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,774
You want to run off like
your buddy Enrico?

33
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,319
Because I've got news for you.
He's either dead, or he's

34
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,406
out there. Somewhere. Seeing the world.

35
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,075
But he's probably dead.

36
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,036
Phew. Okay, that's everyone.

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,706
Monalisa, why are you smiling?

38
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,875
Anyone else in there?

39
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,461
Giuseppe.

40
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,589
What did we just talk about?

41
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,842
Oh, Giuseppe.

42
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,595
All right. Let's head out.

43
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,061
- Hello.
- Good morning.

44
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,940
- Hi, Mrs. Aragosta.
- Hey, Luca!

45
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,405
- Good morning!
- Morning!

46
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,423
Okay. All clear.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,806
Let me know if you need anything.

48
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,226
Anyone?

49
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,978
No? Okay.

50
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,413
Giuseppe...

51
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,894
Oh.

52
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,606
Huh?

53
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,549
Land monsters! Everybody, under the rock!

54
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,163
Huh?

55
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,457
Luca!

56
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,876
Lunch is ready!

57
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,294
Be right there!

58
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,927
Come on! We gotta get back.

59
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,848
You're two minutes late.

60
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,099
- Was there a boat? Huh?
- Uh...

61
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,267
- Did you hide?
- Yes, Mom.

62
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,853
Because if they catch
even a glimpse of you...

63
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,772
You think they come around
to meet new friends, huh?

64
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,315
- No.
- Make small talk.

65
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
- I... I don't.
- No.

66
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,984
- They're here to do murders.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,152
So, I'm just making sure you know.

68
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,237
Thanks, Mom.

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,321
When I was a kid,

70
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,156
we'd go weeks without seeing a boat,

71
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,200
and let me tell you,
they did not have motors.

72
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,786
Just a sweaty land monster with a paddle.

73
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,955
- Hi, Grandma. Mwah.
- Hey, Bubble.

74
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,331
- Hi, Dad.
- Luca!

75
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,501
Look at Pinchy-pessa. She's molting.

76
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,878
Oh, it's magnificent.

77
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,173
Now, here's a champion
show crab if I ever saw one.

78
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,967
- Oh, nice.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

79
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,802
- Don't look her in the eye!
- Sorry.

80
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,013
But don't apologize.
She can sense weakness.

81
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,223
Oh!

82
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,267
Come eat, Luca. Come on.

83
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,103
We better beat those Branzinos
at the crab show this year.

84
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,189
Everyone thinks Bianca Branzino's so great

85
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,774
with her prize-winning crabs

86
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,777
and amazing dolphin impression. Please!

87
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,237
Anyone can do that.

88
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,656
Right?

89
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,825
I don't know why dolphins
even sound like that.

90
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,660
You know, why don't they just talk?

91
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,744
- Luca.
- Huh?

92
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,204
What's on your mind?

93
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,457
Uh... Uh... Well, I was just wondering...

94
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,334
Where do boats come from?

95
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,589
The land monster town.
Just above the surface.

96
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,841
I beat a guy at cards there once.

97
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,718
Mom! What are you doing?

98
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,845
He's old enough to hear about it.

99
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,347
You've been to the surface
and done the change?

100
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,349
No! No! The end! Shut it down!

101
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,310
I was just curious.

102
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,812
Yeah? Well, the curious fish gets caught.

103
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,398
We do not talk, think,
discuss, contemplate,

104
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,067
or go anywhere near the surface! Got it?

105
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,319
Yes, Mom.

106
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,529
Here. Now let's get back to work.

107
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,118
Hey.

108
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,288
Look me in the eye.

109
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,373
You know I love you, right?

110
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,708
I know, Mom.

111
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,881
We're a little worried about him, right?

112
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,091
No, thanks! I'm full.

113
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,519
Huh?

114
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,776
Hmm.

115
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,664
Whoa.

116
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,500
Hmm.

117
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,460
Hmm.

118
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,311
<i>Boo.</i>

119
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,437
Huh?

120
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,690
It's fine. I'm not human.

121
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,650
Oh! Thank goodness.

122
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,527
Here, hold this.

123
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,243
Uh... Do you live around here?

124
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,079
Down here? No, no, no.
I just came for my stuff.

125
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,163
Ooh.

126
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,584
Uh, hey! Wait, that's mine!

127
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,841
Sir? You forgot your harpoon and...

128
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,301
Oh, yeah. Thanks!

129
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,178
What? What are you doing?

130
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,811
No, no!

131
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,813
Ahh! Oh, no!

132
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,108
Help me!

133
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,943
First time?

134
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,238
Of course it is! I'm a good kid!

135
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,740
Hey, relax.

136
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,866
Breathe.

137
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:39,723
Whoa.

138
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,726
Well? Isn't it great?

139
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,810
No!

140
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,772
It's bad, and I'm not
supposed to be up here.

141
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,148
Good day.

142
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,656
Thank you.

143
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,910
Good... Good day. Again.

144
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,211
Grandma,

145
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,296
did you really go up to the...

146
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,940
Okay, everyone. This is, uh, Smuca.

147
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,026
Yeah. He's in charge now. Got it?

148
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,758
- Wow.
- Aah!

149
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,260
That was hard to watch.

150
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,344
Here.

151
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,804
Come on.

152
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,913
Whoa.

153
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,543
Wait.

154
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,253
It feels like it's still there.

155
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,505
Yeah, that's called phantom tail.

156
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,589
You'll get used to it.

157
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,885
Right. Walking.

158
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,763
Don't worry, you're in luck.
I basically invented it.

159
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,557
To start, stack everything
one on top of the other.

160
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,226
Like a pile of rocks.

161
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,231
Great! I mean, fine, whatever.

162
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,441
Now, walking is just like swimming.

163
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,401
But without fins. Or a tail.

164
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,611
And also, there's no water.

165
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,404
Otherwise, it's like the exact same thing.

166
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,614
Give it a try.

167
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,825
That's not it. Try it again.

168
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,579
Oh, try to lead with your head.

169
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,248
No, more belly.

170
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,168
That's... That's lying on the ground.

171
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,253
How about this?

172
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,296
Just take a step without
even thinking about it.

173
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,048
No, no, no, don't think about it.

174
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,050
I don't know how to
not think about something.

175
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,427
Okay, okay. Watch.

176
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,471
Point your feet to where
you wanna go. Okay?

177
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,682
And then you just catch yourself

178
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:27,766
before you fall.

179
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,937
Yeah, that's right.

180
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,482
Heh.

181
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,027
Good. Good.

182
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,572
- Yes. Yes!
- I'm... I'm getting it!

183
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,950
Not bad, kid. Alberto Scorfano.

184
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,034
Luca Paguro.

185
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,540
It's a human thing. I'm kind of an expert.

186
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,041
What does it mean?

187
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,627
The thing you just said?

188
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,754
Come on. I'll show you some more stuff!

189
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,091
Mother-of-pearl!

190
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:02,718
You live up here?

191
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,094
Yeah. Me and my dad.

192
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,262
He's not even here a whole lot,

193
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,930
so I pretty much just do whatever I want.

194
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,140
Isn't it dangerous?

195
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,433
Yeah, it's the best!

196
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,310
Everything good is above the surface.

197
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,520
Like, what else?

198
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,230
Air!

199
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,402
Gravity! Also known as falling!

200
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,699
The sky. Clouds. The sun.

201
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,743
Whoa. Don't look at it.

202
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,536
Just kidding. Definitely look at it.

203
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,999
And then, there's human stuff.

204
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,420
Whoa.

205
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,464
As you can see,

206
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,341
I've been collecting for a long time,

207
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,425
so ask me anything.

208
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,554
Whoa.

209
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,057
Yes. That's the Magic
Singing Lady Machine.

210
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,559
It's broken, unfortunately.

211
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,522
Whoa! You unbroke it!

212
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,115
What's that?

213
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,202
Oh, it's just the greatest thing
that humans ever made.

214
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,620
The Vespa.

215
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,580
- Whoa.
- You just sit on it,

216
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,541
and it takes you anywhere you wanna go.

217
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,334
In the whole stinkin' world!

218
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,463
"Vespa is freedom."

219
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,300
Huh?

220
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,722
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

221
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,015
Yeah!

222
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,519
Pretty cool, right?

223
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,355
Uh... Yeah.

224
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,942
Huh. Are you gonna make one?

225
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,861
I think you have all the parts.

226
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,363
I do have the parts.

227
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,490
I am gonna make one! You wanna help?

228
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:52,244
Me? Yeah! Wait! No, I can't.

229
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,204
- I gotta go home.
- Right this second?

230
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,582
Yeah, if my parents found out
I was up here...

231
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,041
Oof.

232
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,752
It would be bad. So, thank you, but...

233
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,591
Goodbye. Forever.

234
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,680
Okay, but now, I really do have to go.

235
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,890
Okay. Bye.

236
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,603
Seriously, I have to go,
like, now. Like, right now.

237
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,937
Okay. See ya.

238
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,525
It's even better than the picture.

239
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,610
Yeah, it is.

240
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,945
Gotta run.

241
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,780
See ya tomorrow!

242
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,246
Luca! Where have you been?

243
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,331
Uh...

244
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,124
<i>Don't say surface.
Don't say surface.</i>

245
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,584
Surface.

246
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,503
What did you just say?

247
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,587
What's wrong with your foot?

248
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:45,964
<i>Luca.</i>

249
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,259
- Oh, I... I...
- Gonna tell us where you were?

250
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,512
- Uh...
- It's my fault.

251
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,430
I sent him to look for sea cucumbers.

252
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,433
Right! Sorry, Grandma,
I couldn't find them.

253
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,726
Mom, his life is

254
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,895
maybe a little more important
than your snacks.

255
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,939
Thank you.

256
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,864
Whoa! How'd you get it down?

257
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,115
I rode it down.

258
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,661
- Uh...
- I didn't.

259
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,913
But I pushed it out the back window.

260
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,498
Took a while to put back together,

261
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,666
but it's fine now.

262
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,626
You ready to ride it?

263
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,925
Oh, well, thank you, but no thank you.

264
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,511
I mean, I just think maybe I would die.

265
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,264
Okay, I'll ride it. You hold the ramp.

266
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,348
Uh...

267
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,394
Sir, maybe we should sleep on it?

268
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,938
Whatever you do, do not move!

269
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,523
I'm not the guy you want for this.

270
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,649
I'm more of an idea man...

271
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,776
Take me, gravity!

272
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:51,989
Um...

273
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,323
Ouch!

274
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,033
This is normal! Stay focused!

275
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,497
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

276
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,921
He's dead. I killed him!

277
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,090
Whoo-hoo!

278
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,884
- Wait. That was good?
- Oh, my...

279
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,052
Did you see the height I got?

280
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,804
Hey, nice ramping.

281
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,472
Come on, let's build another one.

282
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,156
Yahoo!

283
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,951
Huh? Huh?

284
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,078
Ow.

285
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,207
Ha-ha!

286
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,379
Whoo-hoo!

287
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,257
Come on, Luca!

288
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,303
Whoa!

289
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,238
Huh.

290
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,914
What's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

291
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,043
What's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

292
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,390
Look, we gotta ride together.

293
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,267
If you don't sit on the back
and hold on to the front,

294
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,768
the whole thing falls apart.

295
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,271
Oh. And who's holding the ramp?

296
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,107
The turtle. Come on.
He's faster than he looks.

297
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,609
Oh, okay. Here we go.

298
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,737
You, uh, coming?

299
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,198
Nope. I can't do it.
Never in a million years.

300
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,117
Hey, hey, hey. I know your problem.

301
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,451
You've got a Bruno in your head.

302
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,161
- A Bruno?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,413
I get one, too, sometimes.

304
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,957
"Alberto, you can't."
"Alberto, you're gonna die."

305
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,876
"Alberto, don't put that in your mouth."

306
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,045
Luca, it's simple.
Don't listen to stupid Bruno.

307
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,631
Why is his name Bruno?

308
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:15,716
I don't care. It doesn't matter.

309
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,884
Call him whatever you want.

310
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,386
Shut him up. Say, <i>"Silenzio, Bruno."</i>

311
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,140
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

312
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,434
Louder! <i>"Silenzio, Bruno!"</i>

313
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,644
- <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>
- <i>"Silenzio, Bruno!"</i>

314
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:28,729
<i>Silenzio, Bruno!</i>

315
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,315
- Can you still hear him?
- Nope! Just you!

316
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,483
Good! Now, hang on!

317
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,237
<i>Andiamo!</i>

318
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,493
Yeah!

319
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,998
<i>Silenzio, Bruno. Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

320
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,082
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

321
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,876
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

322
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,554
- Whoa.
- Wow.

323
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:03,639
Uh-oh.

324
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,566
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

325
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,528
Yes! We're alive! I can't believe it!

326
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,404
- Take that, Bruno!
- Yes!

327
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,410
What are all those tiny lights?

328
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,913
Anchovies. They go there to sleep.

329
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,874
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,001
And the big fish protects them.

331
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,086
I touched it once.

332
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,129
I don't know, it felt like a fish.

333
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,214
Wow.

334
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,675
Your life is so much cooler than mine.

335
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,009
I never go anywhere.

336
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,262
I just dream about it.

337
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,680
You came up here.

338
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:45,931
Thanks to you.

339
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,017
Otherwise, I never would've
seen any of this.

340
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,940
Have you ever gone to the human town?

341
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,024
Yeah!

342
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,526
Uh... No.

343
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,945
But, but my dad told me all about it.

344
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,572
So, I'm pretty much an expert.

345
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,283
Your dad sounds so cool.

346
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,368
You're lucky he lets you do what you want.

347
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,870
Yeah. For sure.

348
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,792
Hey, you remember that time
we almost hit that rock?

349
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,252
And we flew through the air,

350
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,338
and I was like, "Yeah!"
And then you were like, "No!"

351
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,468
Wouldn't it be amazing
to have a real Vespa?

352
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:26,555
Yeah. That's the dream.

353
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,307
Yeah.

354
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,522
Whoo!

355
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,901
Oh, Luca, look!

356
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,653
Whoa!

357
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,572
Wild Vespas!

358
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,574
Whoo-hoo!

359
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,910
Luca, take over!

360
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,163
Yeah, man!

361
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,667
Come on, faster!

362
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,047
Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

363
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,508
Whoo-hoo!

364
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,267
Whoa.

365
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,191
I'm doing it, Alberto! I'm doing it!

366
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,817
Alberto?

367
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,536
Oh, no! I fell asleep!

368
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,954
What?

369
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,792
Phew.

370
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,756
Uh...

371
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:46,343
Daniela, do we really need
to go through with this?

372
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,553
With what?

373
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,806
Uh, son, you're in big trouble.

374
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,558
You need to promise us

375
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,311
that you'll never sneak off
to the surface again.

376
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:57,980
Uh, I'm really sorry.

377
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,316
But, you know, it's not
that dangerous up there.

378
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,526
Maybe I could show you.

379
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,195
I told you. Our son has a death wish.

380
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,947
But, Mom, we're always careful!

381
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,031
"We"?

382
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,577
Me and my friend, Alberto.

383
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,037
But it's okay. He's one of us.

384
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,833
Ah, yes. There's usually a bad influence.

385
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,170
Good thing you sent for me
when you did, huh?

386
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,257
Luca, this is my brother, your Uncle Ugo.

387
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,176
Thanks again for coming all this way

388
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,552
on such short notice.

389
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,679
Of course.

390
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,972
Hello, Luca.

391
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,600
It's really nice to...

392
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,395
Luca, I need you to punch his heart.

393
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,772
That's right. The red thing. Punch it.

394
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,274
- Harder!
- Oh.

395
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,820
Thanks for that. Too much oxygen up here.

396
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,532
Not like the deep.
As you'll learn.

397
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,242
What?

398
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,869
Sure, there's no sunlight,

399
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,246
but there's nothing to see anyway.

400
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,083
Or do. It's just you and your thoughts,

401
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,046
and all the whale carcass you can eat.

402
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,965
Little bits of it
just float into your mouth.

403
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,217
You can't stop it.

404
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,719
You can't see it. So if you...

405
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,722
The mouth opened,
the whale carcass go in.

406
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,016
Yes, good. I recommend it.

407
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,519
Come on. No time to waste.

408
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,354
Mom, what does he mean?

409
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,397
You're going to stay with Uncle Ugo

410
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,607
for the rest of the season.

411
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,775
No, I can't!

412
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,361
Two seasons, then. Wanna go for three?

413
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,820
Why are you doing this?

414
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,698
The world is a very dangerous place, Luca,

415
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,201
and if I have to send you
to the bottom of the ocean

416
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,911
to keep you safe, so be it.

417
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,287
You don't know what it's like up there!

418
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,457
I know you. And I know
what's best for you.

419
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,167
It's done.

420
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,088
Hey. Look me in the eye.

421
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,757
You know I love you, right?

422
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,106
They're sending me to the deep!

423
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,816
To live with my weird see-through uncle!

424
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,484
- What do I do?
- Stay?

425
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,361
Up here? They'll come looking for me.

426
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,988
Okay, that may be true,

427
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,908
but will they come
looking for you over there?

428
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,828
No way. That's crazy.

429
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,414
I mean, that place must be full of Vespas.

430
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,416
- There's gotta be one for us.
- Huh.

431
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,084
A real Vespa.

432
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,003
Could we even survive over there?

433
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,839
You and me? We can do anything.

434
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,591
We'd swim right over to Vespatown,

435
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:31,758
track down <i>Signor</i> Vespa,

436
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,969
Wait. Do you really think
there's a <i>Signor</i> Vespa?

437
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,971
- Makes sense, right?
- Yes. Continue.

438
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:39,975
And we say, <i>"Signor</i> Vespa,
build us one of these!"

439
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,853
Whoa. This is the greatest
drawing I've ever seen.

440
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,731
Yeah, I know. Luca, think about it.

441
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,900
Every day, we'll ride someplace new,

442
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,611
and every night,
we'll sleep under the fish.

443
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,697
No one to tell us what to do.
Just you and me out there.

444
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:55,324
<i>Free.</i>

445
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,491
Whoo-hoo!

446
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,452
Take me, gravity!

447
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,376
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

448
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,837
Whoo-hoo!

449
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,131
Yeah!

450
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,352
Come on!

451
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,771
Ha-ha!

452
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,964
Yeah! Whoo!

453
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,265
Whoa.

454
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,103
<i>Papà,</i> what's that?

455
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,857
How do we get in?

456
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,538
This will be a breeze.

457
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,373
- Just don't get wet.
- Uh...

458
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,092
Actually, this town seems
a little crowded.

459
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,844
Hey! <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

460
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,721
What's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

461
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:41,805
Huh?

462
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,808
- Huh! It worked.
- See?

463
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,186
You just gotta follow my lead.

464
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,133
Classic human town. Pretty cool, right?

465
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,010
Hey, you do it now. Just say the thing.

466
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:21,929
Mmm.

467
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,597
Madams,

468
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,432
what's wrong with you, <i>stupido?</i>

469
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,234
Maybe I said it wrong?

470
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:36,568
Mmm. Mmm!

471
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:40,989
Wow!

472
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:42,533
Mmm!

473
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,544
Alberto, this is too dangerous.

474
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,087
Let's get out of here.

475
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:56,588
And go where?

476
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,678
Whoa.

477
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:03,929
It's <i>Signor</i> Vespa!

478
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,975
<i>Mannaggia!</i> Here we go.

479
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,812
Oh, <i>mamma mia!</i> Please, no more revving.

480
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,065
<i>Ciao! Ciao!</i>

481
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,652
Beep, beep!

482
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,697
Pride of Portorosso coming through!

483
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,282
- <i>Ciao, belle!</i>
- Hmm, blech!

484
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:24,700
You're making me blush.

485
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:30,747
And now, who wants to watch me
eat a big sandwich? Hmm?

486
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,792
There it is.

487
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,961
That's how we're gonna see the world.

488
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,629
Hey, little help?

489
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:41,258
- Huh?
- Hmm?

490
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,765
Oh, <i>mamma mia!</i>
Talk to Ercole. Are you hurt?

491
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:49,850
Well, my head kinda hurts...

492
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,102
Not you, Ciccio! Out of the way!

493
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:56,064
Oh, <i>piccolina,</i> if there is
so much as a scratch...

494
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,735
Someone got lucky today. Hmm?

495
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,028
Who got lucky?

496
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,657
Mm-hmm. Out-of-towners, eh?

497
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,326
Let me welcome you.

498
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:11,205
Ciccio?

499
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,458
I am delighted to meet you,
Number One and Number Two.

500
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,543
I love your stylish clothes.

501
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,546
Where did you get them?
A dead body?

502
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,631
Dead body.

503
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:21,715
I'm kidding.

504
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,884
Uh... Look, <i>Signor</i> Vespa...

505
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,220
<i>Signor</i> Vespa?

506
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,513
This guy funny, hmm?

507
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:29,056
I am Ercole Visconti.

508
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,433
Five-time winner of the Portorosso Cup.

509
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,101
The Portorosso what?

510
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,478
The Portorosso Cup!

511
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:38,315
How do you think
I paid for my beautiful Vespa?

512
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,735
Hey, stop looking.

513
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,819
She's too beautiful for you.

514
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,572
I, uh...

515
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,282
I love it.

516
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,076
The little guy can't even get a word out.

517
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,788
Oof. And he smells like behind
the <i>pescheria.</i>

518
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,540
Hey, my friend smells amazing.

519
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,959
Sorry, sorry. I'll make it up to him.

520
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,919
Ciccio, Guido.

521
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,003
What are you doing?

522
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,088
- Luca!
- Alberto!

523
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,297
Ah, just a little bath.

524
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,715
- Oh, no, no, no!
- It's funny.

525
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,300
Huh?

526
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,345
- No!
- Huh?

527
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,305
Hey! Ercole, <i>basta!</i>

528
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,767
Oh, look who's here. Spewlia.

529
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,019
Wow.
That's how you're training for the race?

530
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,438
Your reign of terror is

531
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,148
- coming to an end!
- "Coming to an end."

532
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:21,400
You mean like a year ago?

533
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,068
When you quit in the middle of the race?

534
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,988
Because you couldn't stop
throwing up?

535
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,323
I didn't quit. They made me stop.

536
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,784
I think that is worse. Now, go away.

537
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,244
I'm having fun with my new friends.

538
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,328
They're coming with me.

539
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,999
Hop on. I could use the extra weight.

540
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,711
Fine. Go start a club. For losers!

541
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,506
<i>Maggiore!</i> Another sighting.
In the harbor, this time.

542
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,842
I know. We are setting up a reward.

543
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,927
Someone's gonna win a nice prize.

544
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,637
Me! Me! I win the prizes.

545
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,722
Ciccio!

546
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:52,848
Get your daddy's harpoon!

547
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,975
We're gonna catch a sea monster.

548
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,185
<i>Sì!</i>

549
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:58,437
<i>Sto imbecille</i> thinks he can be a jerk

550
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,521
'cause he keeps winning the race,

551
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:01,106
which he shouldn't even
get to do anymore,

552
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,317
'cause he's too old
and too much of a jerk!

553
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,111
You know, we underdogs

554
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,571
have to look out for each other, right?

555
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,114
What's under the dogs?

556
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:10,574
Underdogs.

557
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,117
You know, kids who are different,

558
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,202
dressed weird,

559
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:15,495
or a little sweatier than average.

560
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,663
Uh...

561
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,332
Too much? Too much.

562
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,709
So, are you in town for the race?

563
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,629
The Portorosso Cup?

564
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,049
Well, good talk.

565
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:30,552
I gotta deliver these.
Always be training, you know?

566
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,640
We should ask her
about this Portorosso Cup race.

567
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:37,434
That's how the loud scary human said
he got his Vespa.

568
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,811
Giulia!

569
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:42,231
Oh!

570
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,482
- Uh, <i>grazie.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>

571
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,691
Hey, uh, Spewlia?

572
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,902
Giulia. My name is Giulia.

573
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:51,365
Okay. When you race in a cup,
what do you get?

574
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,867
<i>Soldi.</i> Prize money.

575
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,202
Oh.

576
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,286
Okay.

577
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,121
- No, no! Keep going!
- What? Why?

578
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,206
Ask her about the prize money!

579
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,332
But that stuff is useless.

580
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:02,000
- Maybe that becomes a Vespa.
- How does that become...

581
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:03,293
- Just ask her!
- Fine, fine, fine.

582
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,504
- Hello again.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

583
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,382
Can we turn the money into something else?

584
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,717
- Something like...
- That.

585
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,680
Pfft. No. But it could get you that.

586
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,027
Whoo-hoo!

587
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,612
It's so beautiful.

588
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,030
Yes, we need it.

589
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,824
Great, so we'll just win the race.

590
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,535
You'll have to beat Ercole.

591
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,078
Okay, so we'll beat Ercole.

592
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,454
Huh. Really?

593
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:41,498
Thinks he'll beat Ercole,
this guy.

594
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,208
First of all, get in line!

595
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:46,795
Every summer, that jerk
makes my life miserable.

596
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,715
So, no one's taking him down
unless it's me!

597
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,801
Second, this isn't any old race.

598
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:56,013
It's an epic, grueling,
traditional Italian triathlon.

599
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,932
Swimming, cycling, and eating pasta.

600
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,225
So, you'd need a teammate.

601
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,978
Well, we'll figure it out.
Thanks, human girl.

602
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,316
Hey, hey, wait. Wait, Alberto.

603
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,151
What if we join her team?

604
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:10,277
<i>Grazie! Arrivederci!</i>

605
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,987
Hmm. Better idea.

606
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,572
Hey, Spew... Girl!

607
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:14,740
<i>Santa mozzarella.</i>

608
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,867
Congratulations, you're joining our team.

609
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,827
I race alone.

610
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,460
But we could be under the dogs, too.

611
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:27,753
Hey, it's okay, Luca.

612
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,214
She'd rather do
the whole race alone again.

613
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,965
Maybe this time
she won't throw up as much.

614
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,467
Uh, hang on.

615
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:37,971
You wanna be on my team, eh?

616
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:39,515
Let's see what you got.

617
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,355
All right, try jumping onto it.

618
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:48,357
No, no, no.

619
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,067
You gotta show it you're the boss!

620
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,487
<i>Santa mozzarella.</i>

621
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,863
- Eyes up.
- Huh?

622
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,115
Looking down is what's making you fall.

623
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,036
Whoa.

624
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:04,665
Whoa. I'm doing it.

625
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,417
So, can we be on the team?

626
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:09,920
Can you dodge obstacles?

627
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,922
What if an old lady crosses your path?

628
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,926
Can you withstand
passive-aggressive verbal assaults?

629
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,970
"Nice bike,
Number One and Number Two.

630
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,054
"I was kidding.

631
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,597
"Your bike is a disgrace."

632
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,057
Finally, can you handle

633
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,351
the course's fiendishly difficult terrain?

634
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:25,811
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

635
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,111
Hmm.

636
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:37,781
Stop. What about you?

637
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:38,949
Can you swim at least?

638
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:42,870
Yeah, I'm amazingly
bad at swimming.

639
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:45,330
You can't swim,
you can barely ride a bike.

640
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,667
I mean, where are you even from?

641
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,169
We're not telling you our secrets!

642
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,045
- We're runaways.
- Runaways?

643
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,463
I don't know, <i>ragazzi...</i>

644
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,132
Please?

645
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,926
My family was gonna send me
somewhere horrible.

646
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,845
Away from everything I love.

647
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,389
But if we win this race, well,

648
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,849
we can be free.

649
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,977
My life's great. I'm just helping him out.

650
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,187
Hmm.

651
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,730
Just give me one more chance.

652
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,231
No.

653
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,567
You guys want it just as bad as I do.

654
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,651
You have the hunger.

655
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:15,944
That's the most important thing.

656
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,446
I'm definitely hungry.

657
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,324
<i>Perfetto!</i> You eat, you bike, and I swim.

658
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,701
Underdogs?

659
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,953
Underdogs.

660
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,623
Now we just need money for the entry fee.

661
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,291
From my dad.

662
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,637
All right, just let me do the talking
and act casual.

663
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,180
He doesn't do well with fear.

664
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,723
Hey, <i>Papà!</i> I brought

665
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,183
some friends for dinner.

666
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,851
Is there enough for four?

667
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:51,813
Whoa.

668
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:53,649
What's wrong with you, <i>stu...</i>

669
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,908
What do you think he kills with those?

670
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,245
Anything that swims.

671
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,038
<i>Hai visto il giornale</i> today?

672
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:10,165
That photo is a fake, <i>Papà.</i>

673
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:14,086
Everyone in Portorosso
pretends to believe in sea monsters.

674
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,505
Huh.

675
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,674
Well, I'm not pretending.

676
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:21,885
Huh?

677
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,689
Slipped.

678
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,441
Eh.

679
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,902
Phew!

680
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:42,948
Dinner's ready.

681
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,992
Trenette al pesto.

682
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,266
Mmm!

683
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,229
Uh...

684
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:15,898
Mmm!

685
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,358
Okay.

686
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,154
Where did you boys say you were from?

687
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,575
They're, uh,
classmates. From Genova.

688
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,368
Luca and, uh...

689
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:30,287
- Alberto.
- Alberto.

690
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:33,498
And what brings you to Portorosso?

691
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:34,666
Oh. Uh...

692
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,043
Funny you should ask.

693
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:37,336
They came for the race.

694
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,087
The race?

695
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,464
Yeah.

696
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:43,175
Uh, you know what? Don't worry about it.

697
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,135
"Don't worry about it"?

698
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,513
Mm-hmm. Don't worry about it.

699
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:50,766
Giulietta. A word.

700
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,478
I don't want you doing the race again.

701
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:55,729
You get so upset.

702
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:58,273
<i>Papà, per favore,</i> I have a team now.

703
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:01,360
There's also the entry fee.
Money is tight.

704
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,570
I'll work double shifts at the <i>pescheria.</i>
Whatever you need.

705
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,989
I can't sell what I don't have.

706
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,408
What I need is more fish in my net.

707
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,412
Um, excuse me?

708
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:13,872
We could help.

709
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,374
You know fish?

710
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,292
Oh, we? We know lots of fish.

711
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,545
- Huh.
- Can this face lose?

712
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,258
You want to work? I'll put you to work.

713
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:25,843
Really?

714
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:27,636
Oh, <i>grazie, Papà.</i>

715
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,141
Machiavelli! Don't you...

716
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,644
No! Machiavelli!

717
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,773
I'm so sorry about the cat.

718
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:41,358
I don't know what got into him.

719
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,319
It's fine. We're gonna head back to, uh...

720
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:45,863
Oh!

721
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,574
Do you guys need a place to stay?

722
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,243
Cool.

723
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,829
Oops! Sorry. This is my...

724
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:54,913
Your hideout.

725
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,666
Huh. Yeah. My hideout.

726
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,751
<i>Buonanotte</i>, boys.

727
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,295
Whoa!

728
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,299
Slipped.
Uh, see you in the morning.

729
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,844
- That was close.
- I know.

730
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,762
Like, how big was that dad human?

731
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,347
That guy kills things, for sure.

732
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,266
I thought we were gonna die,
like, a hundred times.

733
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:15,350
Hey, relax.

734
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,186
We're incredible at this humaning stuff.

735
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:19,146
Yeah. You're right.

736
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,564
Did you see me on the bike?

737
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:21,773
Giulia said, "Look up,"

738
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:23,192
and then all of a sudden, I was riding it.

739
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,735
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Our Vespa's gonna be

740
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,570
even better than a bike, though.

741
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,031
Because the moment we get it,
we're outta here.

742
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,660
I can't wait.

743
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,512
How could my mother tell him

744
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,722
about this town of bloodthirsty lunatics?

745
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,891
I still can't believe he would do this.

746
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:56,975
It's not like him.

747
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,227
Just keep your guard up.

748
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,728
There's gonna be land monsters everywhere.

749
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:04,566
- Daniela! Ooh! Wait! Ow! Ow!
- No! Not today, land monster!

750
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,151
- It's me!
- Oh!

751
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,736
You scared the scales off of me!

752
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,112
Jeez, you're strong!

753
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,489
I'm sorry, I'm just a little on edge.

754
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:13,492
No. I needed that. It really woke me up.

755
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,495
Wow! We look horrifying.

756
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,038
Ugh, gross.

757
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,915
Come on. Let's find our son.

758
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:39,059
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Alberto! Wake up!

759
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,978
What? Ahh! The sky's been leaking!

760
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,076
Hmm. Uh...

761
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,411
Oh. There you are!

762
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,246
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

763
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:00,455
All right, <i>ragazzi.</i>

764
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,499
You want that entry fee,
you got to earn it.

765
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,584
- Giulietta...
- I'm on it!

766
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,044
- ...you make the deliveries.
- Already makin' 'em! <i>Ciao!</i>

767
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,213
Hmm. You two are coming with me.

768
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,298
Oh.

769
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:11,175
Which knife do I get? Huh? Huh?

770
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:12,551
You don't.

771
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,721
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Massimo!

772
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:18,390
You'll keep an eye out
for those sea monsters, right?

773
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,850
We're all counting on you.

774
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:22,978
Don't worry, Tommaso.
I've got my eyes peeled.

775
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,479
They won't get away.

776
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,866
Hey, this isn't a joyride.

777
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,367
Make yourselves useful.

778
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:45,626
Uh...

779
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,674
Hey,
no goofing around back there.

780
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,490
A sea monster ate it.

781
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:17,991
Huh? What?

782
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:22,496
<i>Ma, no.</i>
This is how I came into the world.

783
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:28,877
Whoa.

784
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,630
<i>Mannaggia,</i> not a great catch today.

785
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:35,175
It might be because we're
over a haunted fish graveyard.

786
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:38,136
We know it's not haunted.
The fish think it's haunted.

787
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,890
This time of day, most fish
will be right about there.

788
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,309
Hmm.

789
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,563
- <i>Ciao,</i> Giulia.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

790
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:51,149
Ha-ha!

791
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,526
New personal best!

792
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:54,987
<i>Santo pecorino.</i>

793
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,280
Shoo! Shoo!

794
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,868
Your friends do know fish.

795
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:04,079
<i>Benissimo!</i>
Ooh, let's go sign up.

796
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:11,879
Okay. Okay.

797
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,797
Now, what's our plan? Think, Daniela.

798
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,841
Hey, everything's always on you.

799
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,176
I wanna step up.

800
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,971
- Uh... You sure?
- Oh, yeah. I got this.

801
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,184
Oh, hello there, young man.

802
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,186
- You're not fooling anyone.
- Lorenzo, eh-eh.

803
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:29,313
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

804
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:31,523
- Renzo...
- You thought we wouldn't find you?

805
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:32,858
- Well, guess what?
- I don't think...

806
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,776
It's time for us to go home.

807
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,371
Let that be a lesson to you!

808
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:48,624
Go, go, go! Run before
its mother gets here!

809
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,168
It turns out I don't got this.

810
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:54,338
No, but I do. I'll know my son when I...

811
00:45:57,341 --> 00:45:58,550
...see him.

812
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,260
Ah, sharks.

813
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:03,096
<i>Grazie, Papà!</i>
Come on, we'd better hurry.

814
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,098
Okay.

815
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,644
Fellow Portorossans!

816
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:11,730
It is I, Giorgio Giorgioni!

817
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:16,527
Slayer of sea monsters
and beloved purveyor of pasta!

818
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,153
Slayer of sea monsters?

819
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,239
Ah, that's just <i>Signora</i> Marsigliese.

820
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:22,115
She works for the sponsor for the race.

821
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,076
This is gonna take forever.

822
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,744
The finest pasta in Liguria

823
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:27,871
at a price every family can afford.

824
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,248
Get to the rules!

825
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:32,209
Enthusiasm. Love to see it.

826
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,002
To win my famous race,

827
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,421
your team must be the first to brave

828
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:38,215
the treacherous waters of the bay,

829
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,926
devour a mystery bowl
of my delicious pasta,

830
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:44,555
and ride to the top
of Mount Portorosso and back!

831
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,223
That all sounds pretty hard.

832
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:49,142
Yeah. Hard to lose. We're going to win.

833
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:50,310
I love your confidence.

834
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:52,062
But don't forget, we're going
to have to go through...

835
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,522
Champion coming through.

836
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,232
- Ugh.
- <i>Ciao, ciao!</i> Hey!

837
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:56,316
Ercole.

838
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,652
Aren't you a little old, Ercole?

839
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,445
<i>Signora!</i> I am 16.

840
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:01,947
You said that last year.

841
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,407
But this year, it's true.

842
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,951
You might want to
save your money, <i>ragazzi.</i>

843
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,120
This year, Ercole's gonna
break the record

844
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,997
and make it six in a row.

845
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,541
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

846
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,210
Spewlia, you teamed up
with these vagrants?

847
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:16,461
Ignore him.

848
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:17,838
Oh, I wish for you that you could.

849
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,340
I'm afraid your friends still need to pay

850
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:22,009
the out-of-town weirdo tax.

851
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,221
Hey! Ercole!
You have to give it back!

852
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,973
Ercole doesn't have to do anything.

853
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,808
He's the Portorosso Cup champion,
number one.

854
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:30,893
And number two,

855
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:32,436
his life is amazing
and everyone loves him.

856
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,938
They don't love you.
They're afraid of you.

857
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,024
Raise your hand
if you love me.

858
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:38,734
See? Everyone.

859
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:40,402
Even you. Bop!

860
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,070
Oh, that's it. Come on, Luca.

861
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:44,031
Hey! The vagrants want to fight.

862
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:45,115
Wow!

863
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,867
- Alberto?
- <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i>

864
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,619
Remember, this is for our Vespa.

865
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:49,995
- Stop.
- A Vespa?

866
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,748
Trash like you can't ride Vespas.

867
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,168
Ercole, you're just afraid
we're gonna put an end to your

868
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,003
- evil empire of injustice.
- "Evil empire of injustice."

869
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,546
Got anything new?

870
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,966
Yeah. Here's a new one.
You look like a, uh... Uh...

871
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,968
- A catfish.
- A catfish!

872
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,428
Huh?

873
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:08,597
Uh, they're bottom-feeders,

874
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,349
and they also have
two sad little whiskers.

875
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,685
Shut up!

876
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:17,689
Listen, <i>piccoletto,</i>

877
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,651
I eat kids like you for breakfast.

878
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:23,654
I dunk them in my <i>cioccolata</i> and...

879
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,280
<i>...finiti!</i>

880
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:29,076
So, here, sign up. Mm?

881
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:31,703
I'll make it my mission to destroy you.

882
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,957
It's gonna be some race, huh?

883
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,960
Sorry, no autographs today.

884
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:39,628
You can put your hand down.

885
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:43,924
Ha-ha! Luca! Bravo, we did it!

886
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:47,511
Giulia Marcovaldo.

887
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,429
<i>Ciao,</i> Giulia. Team of one?

888
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:50,764
Not today.

889
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,475
- Luca Paguro.
- Alberto Scorfano.

890
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:56,645
{\an8}Okay, <i>ragazzi,</i>
we have one week to train.

891
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,065
I got this.

892
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,441
Wait, what?

893
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:03,110
Every year they change the pasta.

894
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:04,820
You have to be ready for anything.

895
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:09,116
Could be cannelloni, penne,
fusilli, trofie, even lasagne.

896
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:13,245
And you have to use a <i>forchetta.</i>
It's the rule.

897
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,790
Ugh! Rules are for rule people.

898
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:30,429
Holy carp. No. I can't.

899
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,264
I know, I know.

900
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:35,100
And remember, <i>piccoletto...</i>

901
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:40,480
<i>Forza,</i> Luca, don't let him get
in your head. You can do this.

902
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:43,859
Okay. <i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i> Here we go.

903
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:46,195
I can't!

904
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,830
I guess that's how humans swim?

905
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,498
Ugh, that's embarrassing.

906
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,584
Any sea monsters?

907
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:04,087
No. But I see some bait.

908
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,759
Oh, no! It's Ercole! Go, go!

909
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,261
- Luca! Faster, faster!
- Why aren't we moving?

910
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,222
Ercole?

911
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,186
- Guido!
- I... I slipped.

912
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:20,521
Ciccio, slap Guido.

913
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:22,022
Again. Like you mean it.

914
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,777
Huh?

915
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:29,446
Hmm. Where did the other one go?

916
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,325
- Eh?
- Ercole!

917
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,494
Whoa!

918
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:39,665
Giulia! It is wool. It cannot get wet!

919
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:41,750
Ciccio, make it dry, <i>subito!</i>

920
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:44,002
Luca? Alberto?

921
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,462
Are you okay?

922
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:46,964
- Um...
- We're good! Good, good, good.

923
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:49,091
Well, I think that's
enough training for today.

924
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:50,592
- Yeah. Agreed.
- Yup.

925
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,930
Ah, Ciccio! The motor!
They are slowly getting away!

926
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,307
Guido, slap Ciccio.

927
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:00,018
With contempt!

928
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,105
- Huh?
- Hmm.

929
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,236
Hey!

930
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,320
Kick it.

931
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:14,116
Oh!

932
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,869
I have an idea.

933
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:17,953
Uh-uh. Honey?

934
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,872
Hey, guys! Can I play, too?

935
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:20,956
Oops, sorry!

936
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,082
I'm not used to legs.

937
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:23,584
Oh. Okay.

938
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:25,836
Get the ball!

939
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:26,920
Come and get it!

940
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,131
Uh-uh!

941
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:31,592
Not our kid, not our kid.

942
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:44,021
Ha-ha!

943
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:50,694
Let's see Bianca Branzino do that!

944
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:52,946
Good effort, team.

945
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,031
You've earned your pasta tonight.

946
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,115
Can I please eat with my hands?

947
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,200
Where could he be?

948
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,285
Well, at least you won. I think.

949
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,995
Yeah, I guess I did.

950
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:01,872
Come on. We just gotta keep looking.

951
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:08,587
Uh...

952
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,673
Alberto? I think
I might've seen my parents.

953
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:14,009
No way. I told you,
they're not coming here.

954
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:15,427
But what if they did?

955
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:16,720
They're gonna send me to the deep.

956
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,680
Listen, relax. It's never gonna happen.

957
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:19,765
All right, boys.

958
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:22,017
Pretty good today,
but let's talk technique.

959
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,811
Hey, <i>ragazzi!</i> I need some help
with the nets.

960
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:27,272
You. The big, strong one.

961
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:28,649
- <i>Andiamo.</i>
- I'll be right back.

962
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:35,447
Hey, we're gonna win.

963
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:37,491
And you'll get your Vespa.

964
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:39,618
Why do you want a Vespa, again?

965
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,537
Oh. Because it'll be amazing.

966
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,498
Every day, me and Alberto
are gonna ride someplace new.

967
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:47,125
And every night,
we'll sleep under the fish.

968
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:50,170
The fish? Good.

969
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,589
How about you?
What'll you do when you win?

970
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:54,883
I'll get up
in front of everyone

971
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,969
and say, "Told you I'd win!"

972
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,303
Yeah.

973
00:52:58,679 --> 00:52:59,888
And then what?

974
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,473
Well, that's it.

975
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:02,766
Look, during school,

976
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,726
I live with my <i>mamma</i> in Genova.

977
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,603
And every summer, I come here,

978
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,273
and everyone thinks
I'm just some weird kid

979
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:10,899
who doesn't belong.

980
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:13,819
I think I know how you feel.

981
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,821
Right? That's why we gotta win.

982
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,239
The town will cheer our names.

983
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,367
Ercole's life will be ruined!

984
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,702
Sorry. Too much?

985
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:23,787
My mom says sometimes I'm too much.

986
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:25,664
No way. Not for me.

987
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:29,793
You know those aren't fish, right?

988
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:33,046
Of course they are.
Alberto told me all about it.

989
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:34,548
Come with me.

990
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,447
This is a telescope.

991
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:00,616
Old man Bernardi lets me use it.

992
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:03,869
It makes faraway things seem close. Look.

993
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,333
See any fish?

994
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,876
Then what are all those?

995
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,669
Stars. Like the sun.

996
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,922
Giant, raging balls of fire!

997
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,007
So, Alberto was wrong.

998
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,092
And stars are circled by planets.

999
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:23,639
Look.

1000
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,517
That's <i>Saturno.</i> It's my favorite.

1001
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,435
It's the lightest of the planets.

1002
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,438
They say if there was an ocean
big enough to hold it,

1003
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:32,731
it would float in it!

1004
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,024
Whoa!

1005
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:37,277
Wow!

1006
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,034
Come on, Luca!

1007
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:12,521
{\an8}So, this is how machines fly?

1008
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:13,605
{\an8}<i>Sì.</i>

1009
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,232
{\an8}And there are big towns
called cities?

1010
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,316
{\an8}<i>Sì.</i>

1011
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,609
Like even bigger than Portorosso?

1012
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:19,862
Like Genova! Literally 20 times bigger.

1013
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,905
And we're all on a big round rock,

1014
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,282
floating around a star

1015
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:25,325
in the "solar system"?

1016
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,785
So cool, right?

1017
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,996
And is there anything
beyond the solar system?

1018
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:31,540
Only a galaxy full of solar systems.

1019
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:34,168
- Then what?
- A universe full of galaxies!

1020
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,044
And then what?

1021
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,462
And then...

1022
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:38,839
I don't know.

1023
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,883
But next year in Advanced Astronomy,

1024
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,593
I'm gonna use my school's telescope.

1025
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:43,844
So, maybe I'll find out.

1026
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:47,055
That thing's huge.
I wish I could show it to you.

1027
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,725
Just promise you'll tell me
everything you see!

1028
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,602
Sorry. Too much?

1029
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,020
Never.

1030
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,106
Hey, Luca, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1031
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,400
- Oh, sorry.
- Just come on. Let's go.

1032
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:01,862
Could I maybe borrow this?
Just for tonight.

1033
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:05,449
You can have it.

1034
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,327
Ha-ha!

1035
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,788
The universe is literally yours!

1036
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:13,332
Wow. Thank you!

1037
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,458
Luca!

1038
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:15,751
Okay.

1039
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:21,715
Where are we going?

1040
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,342
Come on.
I got something to show you.

1041
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,095
Hey, you won't believe this.
Those aren't fish.

1042
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,222
- What?
- Yeah.

1043
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:29,681
Giulia explained it to me.

1044
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:30,766
They're fires.

1045
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:33,143
But, like, one million times bigger.

1046
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:34,937
Uh, no, they're not.

1047
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:41,026
Soon you'll be ours, sweet Vespa.

1048
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:42,194
Take a look.

1049
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,238
I thought of every
single thing we're gonna need.

1050
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:45,572
{\an8}Also, I added flames.

1051
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,533
That's so cool!

1052
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,536
Oh! And we can bring
a telescope, too!

1053
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,704
Yeah! That shoots lightning!

1054
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:53,789
No, no, no.

1055
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,457
You look through it.

1056
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:58,877
Giulia says there's an even
bigger one at her school.

1057
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,963
Wait. What if we visit her there?

1058
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,840
Why would you wanna do that?

1059
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,633
It kinda sounds interesting.

1060
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:07,344
The whole reason we're getting a Vespa
is to live on our own.

1061
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:10,013
We don't need school.
We don't need anybody.

1062
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:12,057
Couldn't we just try it?

1063
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,684
Just for a few days?

1064
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:16,353
Luca, sea monsters can't go to school.

1065
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:17,896
What do you think is gonna happen

1066
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,398
when they see your fish face?

1067
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:24,570
Hey, look who it is.

1068
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,822
And with no Giulia to hide behind.

1069
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:28,532
- Come on. Let's go.
- No.

1070
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:30,534
Something's fishy with you two.

1071
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:32,202
I mean, besides the smell.

1072
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,495
You're hiding something.

1073
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,664
Is it that we're smarter than you?

1074
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,749
I mean, we're not really hiding that.

1075
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,209
It's just kind of obvious.

1076
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,420
You know, people think I'm a nice guy.

1077
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,005
Always joking around.

1078
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:45,340
But really, I'm not.

1079
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:47,467
- Stop!
- Wait your turn, <i>piccoletto.</i>

1080
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,970
I want to make myself very clear.

1081
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:51,555
This is my town,

1082
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:52,764
number one...

1083
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:56,476
...and number two, I don't want you in it.

1084
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,353
I... I said stop!

1085
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:01,815
Put that down, <i>piccoletto.</i>
You'll hurt yourself.

1086
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,150
Let him go!

1087
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:08,739
Go. Now. Before I change my mind.

1088
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:13,035
Nobody wants you here, <i>idioti!</i>
Keep running!

1089
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:18,540
Why did you make him mad?
We should've left.

1090
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:20,042
No, no, no. We're fine.

1091
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:21,919
I had it under control.

1092
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,172
All you gotta do
is follow my lead, remember?

1093
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,725
Rise and shine!

1094
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:41,063
Go, go! Go, Alberto! Go!

1095
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,703
Nope. Whoa...

1096
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,085
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

1097
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:11,176
Sea monster!

1098
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:14,346
Whew.

1099
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,099
Oh.

1100
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:20,352
Wha...

1101
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:21,520
Ugo?

1102
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:28,944
Rise and shine!

1103
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,904
Only two days till the race.

1104
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:32,197
Hmm.

1105
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:34,992
Espresso.

1106
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:41,248
Go, Luca!

1107
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:42,332
Go, go!

1108
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,084
Hey, don't cheer for him!

1109
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,171
Ha-ha! Whoo!

1110
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:50,215
This is fun!

1111
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,050
Uh...

1112
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:53,719
Hmm.

1113
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:58,098
Mm?

1114
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,519
Huh. Hey!

1115
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,313
{\an8}That's amazing!

1116
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:06,732
{\an8}Oh, wow!

1117
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:16,533
I don't know, Lorenzo.
Was I too hard on him?

1118
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:19,953
No. You were just trying
to keep him safe.

1119
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:21,330
It's my fault.

1120
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:24,458
I wasn't paying enough attention to him.

1121
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,753
But I was the one who tried
to send him away.

1122
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,922
I just never in a million years

1123
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:31,340
would have thought he'd do this.

1124
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:32,424
It's like I don't even know...

1125
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:33,509
You can do it, Luca!

1126
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:35,719
...who he is!

1127
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:37,095
Go, go!

1128
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,430
- Luca!
- Luca!

1129
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:39,973
Luca, stop!

1130
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,309
Luca!

1131
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:46,313
Where are we going?

1132
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:47,940
Uh... A shortcut.

1133
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:50,442
Steeper, rough terrain... I like it.

1134
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:52,236
Why aren't you training?

1135
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:54,238
I'm always training.

1136
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:03,372
Bravo, Luca. That was your fastest yet.

1137
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,915
Ooh, guys, look!

1138
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:06,708
That's the train to Genova.

1139
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,085
That goes to your school?

1140
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,169
Yeah.

1141
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:10,879
I was wondering, actually,

1142
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:13,590
is your school open to everyone?

1143
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:16,510
Well, it costs a little money,
but I guess.

1144
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:17,928
Great. Thank you, Giulia,

1145
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,638
for showing us the boring thing

1146
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,265
that takes us to the terrible place.

1147
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,225
Now, can we focus on what matters?

1148
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:26,103
If we lose this race,
we're not going anywhere.

1149
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,856
<i>Santa mozzarella.</i> The downhill.

1150
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:29,940
I know it looks scary.

1151
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,024
But here's what you need to know...

1152
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,234
Would you stop bossing him around?

1153
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:33,318
What is your problem?

1154
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:35,529
I'm his friend. I know what he needs.

1155
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:37,197
Oh, yeah?
Well, then, what does he need?

1156
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,992
Me. We'll just ride it
like we did on the island. Together.

1157
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:41,910
- <i>Andiamo.</i>
- No!

1158
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:43,579
Alberto, stop!

1159
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:44,997
That's Bruno talking!

1160
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,666
No! I'm pretty sure that's just me!

1161
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:54,339
- Stop, Alberto!
- Let it go!

1162
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:55,424
Look out!

1163
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:04,683
<i>Porca paletta,</i> what was that?

1164
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:05,767
Huh?

1165
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:08,437
Bah! Not now, Ciccio! Eyes on the water!

1166
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,022
- Move, move!
- Okay.

1167
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,944
Oh, no!
Luca! Alberto!

1168
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,113
She'll see us. Come on!

1169
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,120
Look, I was just trying to
show you how to do it right.

1170
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:26,747
You don't know how to do it right!

1171
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,165
I got us down the hill, didn't I?

1172
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,334
You crashed! Into the sea!

1173
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:31,502
It's fine.

1174
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:34,254
Nothing's fine! My parents just saw me!

1175
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,756
Luca, your parents aren't here.

1176
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,424
You don't know what you're talking about!

1177
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:39,343
Look, this town is making you crazy.

1178
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:41,970
We just need to win that Vespa
and get outta here.

1179
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,389
It's not gonna be any different.

1180
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:46,058
I don't wanna...

1181
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:50,687
I wanna go to school.

1182
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,232
That again? We can't go to school.

1183
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:54,691
You're just afraid you can't do it.

1184
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:56,235
I'm not afraid.

1185
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:57,569
You're the one who gets afraid.

1186
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:58,946
Shut up!

1187
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:02,449
Ow!

1188
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,244
What happens when she sees you?

1189
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,328
When anyone sees you?

1190
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,746
Get off me!

1191
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,748
You're alive!

1192
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,088
Hey! You're never allowed
on my bike again.

1193
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,840
Stick to food, big guy.

1194
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,678
Uh, what's going on?

1195
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,054
Nothing. Let's just get back to training.

1196
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,390
Actually, we have something to ask you.

1197
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:27,599
We were wondering

1198
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,643
if we could come with you to your school?

1199
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:33,772
<i>Santo pecorino!</i> That's the best idea ever!

1200
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,108
Yes! Of course!

1201
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,406
Uh, Giulia, your school,

1202
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,449
does it take all kinds of people?

1203
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:47,244
I mean, what if some of them
were not human?

1204
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:48,412
Alberto...

1205
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,082
What if some were, oh,
I don't know, sea monsters?

1206
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:53,166
Sea monsters?

1207
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,253
I doubt your school would even
accept sea monsters, right?

1208
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:59,214
Ah, that's a weird joke, Alberto.

1209
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:01,133
Yeah, I know, it's kinda hard to imagine.

1210
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:02,384
So, let me just show you!

1211
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:03,635
No!

1212
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:06,430
- Come on.
- Giulia, wait!

1213
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:08,265
We don't have time to goof around.

1214
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,058
Huh?

1215
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:16,565
Help!

1216
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,192
Don't hurt us!

1217
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:19,902
- See? I knew this would...
- Sea monster!

1218
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,821
Did you hear that? This way.

1219
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:24,656
Luca?

1220
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:28,243
Stay back!

1221
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:31,580
Sea monster! There it is!

1222
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,503
<i>Ragazzi,</i> now!

1223
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:38,587
No!

1224
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:46,136
Ah, <i>idioti,</i> you let it get away!

1225
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,221
To the boat!

1226
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:48,847
We're gonna kill a sea monster!

1227
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:06,198
Oh, there you are. I made your favorite,

1228
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:07,741
trenette al pesto.

1229
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,785
Where's Alberto?

1230
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,829
Uh, he left, <i>Signor</i> Marcovaldo.

1231
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:18,752
Do you know where he went?

1232
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:20,796
No. But I don't think

1233
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:22,339
he wants anyone looking for him.

1234
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:25,050
Maybe not. But just in case.

1235
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:29,888
Okay.

1236
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,181
Well, the two of us can still do the race.

1237
01:05:31,807 --> 01:05:34,226
You'll swim, you'll eat,
you've done both before...

1238
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:35,727
- Luca, I...
- ...and I'll do the ride.

1239
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:37,229
I mean, that's allowed, right?

1240
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:38,897
- Luca. Luca?
- It should be fine,

1241
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:40,274
- we're still okay...
- Luca!

1242
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,488
Sleeping under the fish.
Now I get it.

1243
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:47,614
Uh, I can explain.

1244
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,409
Of all the places
for sea monsters to visit,

1245
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:51,785
Portorosso?

1246
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,495
Have you seen this town?

1247
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,998
My father hunts sea monsters!

1248
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:58,166
Luca, you have to get out of here.

1249
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,460
But I thought we were underdogs.

1250
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:03,297
Do you think I want you to leave?

1251
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,008
This is the happiest I've...

1252
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,968
Look, it's just not worth it.

1253
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,761
You don't understand.

1254
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:11,555
No, I don't.

1255
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:14,266
Risking your life for a Vespa?

1256
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,476
My parents were gonna send me away.

1257
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:20,314
That's why we did all of this.

1258
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:25,194
But it's over now.

1259
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:30,949
Goodbye, Giulia.

1260
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,784
I'm sorry.

1261
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:16,161
Alberto?

1262
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:26,463
What are you doing here?

1263
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:28,215
I'm...

1264
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:30,175
I'm sorry.

1265
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,887
I... I never should've done that.

1266
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,097
I wish I could take it back.

1267
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,267
Yeah, whatever. You're sorry.
Now, just go away!

1268
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:57,953
Alberto?

1269
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:00,622
What are those marks on the wall?

1270
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,001
Tell me what they mean.

1271
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:08,922
I started when my dad left.

1272
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:14,219
You were living here alone
for that many days?

1273
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:18,390
I just stopped counting after a while.

1274
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:21,268
He said I was old enough to be on my own.

1275
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:25,731
I just thought that...

1276
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:28,734
...maybe he'd change his mind.

1277
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:32,029
Honestly, though, I get it.

1278
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:33,864
He's better off without me.

1279
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:35,699
You are, too.

1280
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:36,909
That's not true.

1281
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,076
Yes, it is.

1282
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,412
You're not like me. You're the good kid.

1283
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:43,373
And I'm just
the kid that ruins everything.

1284
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:47,503
<i>Silenzio, Bruno.</i> That's just
the dumb voice in your head.

1285
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:48,754
You taught me that.

1286
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:51,006
And getting a Vespa? Seeing the world...

1287
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:52,674
Just let it go! Okay?

1288
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:54,551
Look, you and I
should've never been friends

1289
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:55,636
in the first place.

1290
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:57,763
Don't say that.

1291
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:59,431
- Alberto?
- Get outta here!

1292
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,433
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1293
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:08,607
Okay. I'll go.

1294
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:10,526
I'll go win the race.

1295
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:12,611
- What?
- Yeah.

1296
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:16,031
Yeah! And then the Vespa will be ours!

1297
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:17,908
And we'll ride away together!

1298
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,785
Luca, that's crazy.

1299
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:21,036
Well, maybe I'm crazy.

1300
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:22,746
Take me, gravity!

1301
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:23,914
Luca!

1302
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:25,999
Ow.

1303
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,626
What are you doing?

1304
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,128
I'm okay. I'll be back tomorrow.

1305
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:32,130
I'm gonna fix this!

1306
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:39,763
You want to split up your team?

1307
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,431
Yes. If it's allowed.

1308
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:43,308
Luca? What are you doing here?

1309
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,185
Don't worry. I'll race on my own.

1310
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:47,646
You can if you want,
but I don't recommend it.

1311
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:48,814
Thank you!

1312
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:50,274
But how are you gonna...

1313
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:52,693
I mean, what happens when the...

1314
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:54,403
You can't swim!

1315
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:55,904
Alone again?

1316
01:09:58,615 --> 01:09:59,616
Hmm.

1317
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,701
- Ah, volunteers...
- Huh?

1318
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:01,785
- ...you're late.
- Huh?

1319
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:02,870
One cup for each kid.

1320
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:03,954
Oh!

1321
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:05,289
- Yeah. One cup per kid.
- Yes.

1322
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,373
- Got it.
- Here.

1323
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:09,042
For when Giulia, you know, she...

1324
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,890
Ciccio, hold still. <i>Olio d'oliva.</i>

1325
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:25,017
He will cut through the water
like a knife.

1326
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,186
- Oh! Ah.
- An oily knife.

1327
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:28,896
Huh?

1328
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:30,522
Huh?

1329
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,238
This makes me laugh.

1330
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,575
I guess even your terrible friends

1331
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:42,743
don't want to be friends.

1332
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:45,662
Luca! This is a very bad idea!

1333
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:47,247
Hey, vagrant!

1334
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:49,666
Can't afford a proper swimsuit?

1335
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,126
<i>Signore e signori,</i>

1336
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:54,171
the Portorosso Cup is about to begin!

1337
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:56,715
We know there's been
a few sightings lately,

1338
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,133
but fear not!

1339
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:00,177
If any sea monsters show up today,

1340
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,762
we are ready for them.

1341
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:06,683
Swimmers, take your mark!

1342
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:47,724
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1343
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,061
What?

1344
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:00,237
Swim, Ciccio! Come on!

1345
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,114
Swim!

1346
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:08,370
Ha-ha! Trenette!

1347
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:28,640
Come on!

1348
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:33,645
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

1349
01:12:34,813 --> 01:12:37,441
Stop crying and tag Guido! <i>Imbecille!</i>

1350
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,234
<i>Andiamo!</i> Run, run!

1351
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:44,406
<i>Finito!</i>

1352
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:52,456
<i>Per mille cavoli,</i> Guido! Faster!

1353
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,416
Eat, <i>idiota! Più veloce!</i>

1354
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:55,792
Hey, that's not allowed.

1355
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,044
He's done!

1356
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:02,716
Done!

1357
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:11,266
Whoa.

1358
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:21,693
But he's gotta be here somewhere.

1359
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,362
Thirsty? Water, anyone?

1360
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:24,613
- Please, don't!
- Not again!

1361
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:26,448
That's him. That's him!

1362
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:27,533
Luca, stop!

1363
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,745
Sorry, Mom! Sorry, Dad! I have to do this!

1364
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:34,831
Get back here right now!

1365
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,292
Wow. He's fast.

1366
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,420
What?

1367
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,637
Oops! <i>Scusa.</i>

1368
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,806
I'll catch you on the... downhill!

1369
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:53,642
Spewlia, you never even
made it to the downhill.

1370
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:56,520
What?

1371
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:02,901
<i>Impossibile!</i> He's cheating!
<i>Arbitro! Arbitro!</i>

1372
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:05,195
Huh?

1373
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:06,321
No, no, no!

1374
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:12,744
Ooh.

1375
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:23,380
Oh, not now! Come on, come on!

1376
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:25,215
I'm so close!

1377
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:28,886
Luca!

1378
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:32,681
Just stay right there!

1379
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:33,765
Alberto.

1380
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,184
I'm coming for you!

1381
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,352
What's wrong, <i>piccoletto?</i>

1382
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:39,104
Afraid of a little rain?

1383
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,189
- Hey!
- Huh?

1384
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:43,192
For the last time,
you two don't belong here.

1385
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:45,068
Get out of my town!

1386
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:53,243
Sea monster! Right there!

1387
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:54,369
Huh?

1388
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:55,537
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1389
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,789
Ciccio! My harpoon! <i>Veloce!</i>

1390
01:15:00,959 --> 01:15:03,962
- Alberto...
- No, stop! Just stay there.

1391
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:06,423
You're still okay.

1392
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:09,343
- <i>Andiamo!</i>
- Alberto, wait!

1393
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,056
No!

1394
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:33,367
What?

1395
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,953
Whoa! You really are crazy!

1396
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:37,788
Learned it from you!

1397
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,373
Let's get to the water!

1398
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:42,042
No! Ciccio!

1399
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,126
Here it is.

1400
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:49,424
Hey there.

1401
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:50,676
Excuse us.

1402
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,220
Out of the way! <i>Via, via!</i>

1403
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,189
Ha-ha!

1404
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:08,360
Luca!

1405
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:14,741
Sorry!

1406
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:23,917
- Oh, no! Luca!
- Son!

1407
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,630
You should've left when I told you.

1408
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:31,758
Now, I gotta kill some sea monsters!

1409
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:36,138
So long, evil empire of injustice.

1410
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:42,644
No!

1411
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:43,979
Giulia!

1412
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,154
<i>Mostri marini!</i> Give me that!

1413
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:54,948
Giulia. Are you all right?

1414
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:57,701
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm okay.

1415
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,786
Thanks, guys.

1416
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:01,872
Giulietta?

1417
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:03,123
<i>Papà!</i> I...

1418
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,212
Look at that!

1419
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:09,588
You're not going anywhere. Come on.

1420
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:12,508
I saw them first! The reward is mine!

1421
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,134
We're not afraid of you!

1422
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:16,345
No, but we're afraid of you.

1423
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:19,515
Everyone is horrified
and disgusted by you,

1424
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:21,475
because you are monsters.

1425
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:23,185
Stop! They are not monsters.

1426
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:25,187
Oh, yeah? Who are they, then?

1427
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:26,980
I know who they are.

1428
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,451
They are Luca and Alberto,

1429
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:42,037
and...

1430
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:45,666
they are the winners.

1431
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:49,461
- Luca!
- Let us through!

1432
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:50,546
- What?
- Really?

1433
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:52,840
They can't be the winners.
They are not even people!

1434
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:54,258
<i>Signora</i> Marsigliese?

1435
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,512
Technically, legally,

1436
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:00,055
yes, they won.

1437
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:01,682
We won?

1438
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,892
Who cares if they won?
They are sea monsters.

1439
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,567
- <i>Andiamo.</i>
- Hmm.

1440
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:15,779
What? Come on!

1441
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:16,864
- Hey!
- Ha!

1442
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,657
Ciccio! Guido! Another harpoon.

1443
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:23,203
Ah, <i>idioti!</i> Be useful for once
in your pathetic lives.

1444
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:25,455
- Guido.
- Ciccio.

1445
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:31,628
Oops.

1446
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:33,964
No, <i>piccolino.</i>

1447
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:36,300
It's over, the reign of terror.

1448
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,843
It's finally over!

1449
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:39,344
- Luca!
- Luca!

1450
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:42,973
You had us worried half to death,
and you must never do that again!

1451
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,057
I'm sorry.

1452
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:47,060
And you raced your little tail off
and kicked so much human butt!

1453
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:50,189
And I'm so proud of you,
and I am so mad at you!

1454
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,816
I love you, Mom.

1455
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:53,984
Son.

1456
01:18:58,363 --> 01:19:00,115
<i>Signore e signori,</i>

1457
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:03,577
the winners of this year's Portorosso Cup,

1458
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:05,329
the underdogs.

1459
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,581
Wow.

1460
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:09,416
- Wow.
- Yeah!

1461
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,335
- I can't believe we won!
- We won!

1462
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:12,794
Yes! Underdogs!

1463
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:14,546
Ugh.

1464
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:22,137
- Give me that!
- Here.

1465
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:29,978
We did it!

1466
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:32,272
They won!

1467
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:38,070
Feast your eyes on the greatest Vespa

1468
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:39,780
the world has ever seen!

1469
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:43,784
Perfect.

1470
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:50,040
Mmm.

1471
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,543
- <i>Signora.</i>
- <i>Grazie.</i>

1472
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,127
Mom! What are you doing here?

1473
01:19:54,211 --> 01:19:56,213
I come to town most weekends.

1474
01:19:57,422 --> 01:19:58,715
You're not gonna catch me!

1475
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:00,509
- Underdogs forever!
- Whoo-hoo!

1476
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:05,430
What he did today was amazing.

1477
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:08,016
But we can't let him stay in this world.

1478
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:09,685
Can we?

1479
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:12,437
Some people, they'll never accept him.

1480
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:15,315
But some will.

1481
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:18,610
And he seems to know
how to find the good ones.

1482
01:20:22,072 --> 01:20:23,657
So, where will you go first?

1483
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,576
We're gonna stick around here for a bit.

1484
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:28,620
We gotta fix this thing up
before we take it across the entire Earth.

1485
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:31,206
Okay. Just don't forget to pack.

1486
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,710
<i>Santo Gorgonzola!</i>
I need to pack! For school!

1487
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:38,839
Oh, yeah, school.
You're gonna learn so much.

1488
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:41,258
Um, I can leave you some books.

1489
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:42,551
You can?

1490
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:44,469
Come on, Alberto!

1491
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:58,358
And you have your lunch for the train?

1492
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:00,736
- <i>Sì.</i>
- Sweater? If it gets cold?

1493
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:03,238
For the millionth time, <i>sì.</i>

1494
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:05,365
I love you, too, <i>Papà.</i>

1495
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:09,995
<i>Santa mozzarella,</i> we did it.

1496
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:12,414
Well, Giulia,
can't wait to race next summer.

1497
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,583
Or we could just have fun.

1498
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:17,711
<i>Ciao,</i> Giulia.

1499
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,807
Well, let's go fix up our Vespa.

1500
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:32,726
Yeah, about that. Uh...

1501
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:35,312
It's a crazy thing. I might have sold it.

1502
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:39,816
Luca?

1503
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:42,653
Mom? What are you all doing here?

1504
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:48,200
If you promise to write to us
every single day

1505
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:51,495
and be as safe as possible,
and I mean safer than safe,

1506
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:55,123
you can go to school.

1507
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:56,834
I can?

1508
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,502
It's all arranged, actually.

1509
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,587
You'd stay with Giulia and her mom.

1510
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,548
Your friend talked them into it.

1511
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:03,924
It wasn't easy.

1512
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:07,761
Luca, do you promise?

1513
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:09,555
Yes! Yes, I promise!

1514
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:11,515
Thank you.

1515
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,687
Oh. Just remember,
we are always here for you.

1516
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:17,771
Okay?

1517
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,732
Hey. Look me in the eye.

1518
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:23,485
You know I love you, right?

1519
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,571
I know.

1520
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:33,120
Come on, Alberto. The train's gonna leave.

1521
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,832
Where's your stuff?

1522
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:39,710
Yeah, well, you see...

1523
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,295
You are coming, right?

1524
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:46,008
Um, I would, but Massimo asked
if I wanted to stick around.

1525
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,927
Move in maybe. And I just thought, uh...

1526
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:52,806
I think he needs me.
You know?

1527
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:56,852
I can't do it without you.

1528
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:58,437
But you're never without me.

1529
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:02,983
The next time that you jump off a cliff

1530
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:05,736
or tell Bruno to quit bothering you,

1531
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:07,362
that's me.

1532
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:11,366
But how am I gonna know you're okay?

1533
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,126
You got me off the island, Luca.

1534
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:24,505
I'm okay.

1535
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:36,808
Seriously,
what does that mean?

1536
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,520
No idea. Go find out for me, will ya?

1537
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:51,657
Go, Luca!

1538
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,325
Go!

1539
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:56,370
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1540
01:33:47,419 --> 01:33:50,297
Some people think
I'm mad to live in the deep.

1541
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:53,425
I think that they are the ones
who are mad,

1542
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:56,136
not me the one who is mad, it's them.

1543
01:33:56,303 --> 01:33:58,388
It's a nice life, simple life.

1544
01:33:58,555 --> 01:34:00,474
It's away from the hustle and bustle,

1545
01:34:00,557 --> 01:34:02,184
all the stuff that you don't want.

1546
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:07,064
Mmm. Whale carcass.

1547
01:34:07,814 --> 01:34:09,274
Anyway, you're gonna have fun.

1548
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:12,986
You'll get to hear me talk.
I can talk without stopping,

1549
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:16,240
sometimes for maybe 12 hours.

1550
01:34:16,615 --> 01:34:19,034
And you get to listen, so you're lucky.

1551
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:22,079
Well done.
