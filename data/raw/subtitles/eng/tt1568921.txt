00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,810
I'll never forget that summer.

3
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,900
I spent a week in the old house
where my mother grew up.

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,840
Almost there. Feeling all right?

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,050
Yes.

KARIGURASHI NO ARRIETTY

11
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,500
Haru... how many times
have I told her?

12
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,960
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

13
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,300
Haru!

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,300
You're blocking the driveway again.

15
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,230
Sho?

16
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
Where are you?

17
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,470
Don't touch!

18
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,600
These aren't for you.

19
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
- Arrietty!
- What?

20
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,000
You went outside again, didn't you?

21
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,590
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.

22
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,510
It's my own little garden.

23
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,300
If you ask me,
it looks like a mess.

24
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,810
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

25
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,980
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early.

26
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,030
Enough for a whole year.

27
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,540
But the bay tree's
so far away.

28
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,000
If a human bean saw you...

29
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,710
I'm always careful.

30
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,670
The world is full of
dangerous creatures.

31
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,960
Your great uncle...

32
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,720
... was eaten by a frog. Right?

33
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,760
Doesn't that shiso smell lovely?

34
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,680
Yes, it does.

35
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,230
With a bit of sugar
I could make shiso juice.

36
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,900
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

37
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,910
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.

38
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,070
Papa's home.

39
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,160
Welcome back.

40
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,710
- Papa, about tonight...
- There's a boy in the house.

41
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,380
I saw him.

42
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,760
- No! Arrietty...
- He didn't see me!

43
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,930
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

44
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,810
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.

45
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,020
But he's just a child!

46
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,110
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

47
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,360
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

48
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,280
I'll be fine!

49
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,580
Youngsters go to bed early.

50
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,120
Thank you Papa!

51
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
But Pod...

52
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,130
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

53
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,630
But still...

54
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,130
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

55
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,760
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

56
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,890
Someday she'll have to
survive without our help.

57
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,480
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

58
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,430
Whatever you need,
just ask Haru.

59
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,680
All right.

60
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,850
Haru, I'm depending on you.

61
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,810
Yes ma'am.

62
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,150
Let's shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

63
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,570
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

64
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,740
I already decided!

65
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,750
I hope you can borrow
some tissue paper.

66
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,170
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

67
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,090
We could have shiso juice
and sugar for the tea.

68
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,090
But anything's just fine.

69
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,930
We'll be back soon.

70
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,810
Please be careful.

71
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,230
We will.

72
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,260
Arrietty!

73
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,320
Sorry!

74
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,110
- Hold these for me.
- Yes, Papa.

75
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,070
Hold on tight!

76
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,240
Arrietty?

77
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,570
Ready?

78
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,200
Everything's so huge!

79
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,870
The world of human beans.

80
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,000
The sugar's over there.

81
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,630
Wait for me down there.

82
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,050
Papa, you're great!

83
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,560
Now let's get that tissue.

84
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,000
Papa, look.

85
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,830
Your first borrowing.

86
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,290
Be careful, it's sharp.

87
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,670
I will!

88
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

89
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,580
Look down there.

90
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,830
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

91
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,630
I'm not afraid.

92
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,300
I'm ready for anything.
I've got this!

93
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,510
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.

94
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,480
What is this place?

95
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,440
Human beans made it
for their dolls.

96
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,160
It's just perfect for us!

97
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,410
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

98
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,330
These things aren't for borrowing.

99
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,670
If anything went missing
they'd know right away.

100
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,670
Oh...

101
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,980
Don't be afraid.

102
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,500
I saw you.

103
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,550
In the garden.
It was you, wasn't it?

104
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,850
My mother told me about you.

105
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,680
She saw little people here
when she was young.

106
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,190
Was it you that she saw?

107
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,980
Was it?

108
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,410
I'm sorry, Papa.

109
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,240
He saw me today,
out in the garden.

110
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,250
I should've been more careful.

111
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,080
I hope he didn't frighten you.

112
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:13,090
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

113
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,590
All right.

114
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,600
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

115
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,950
We're home.

116
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,870
Safe and sound.

117
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,800
And...?

118
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,140
Things didn't go well this time.

119
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,600
This light gave out
before we finished.

120
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,770
Oh dear.

121
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,480
We had to give up
on the sugar.

122
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,480
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

123
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,950
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

124
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,870
What a pretty pin.

125
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,000
Time for bed.

126
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,680
Good night.

127
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,190
She looks worn out.

128
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,860
Shall I make some tea?

129
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,510
Sho!

130
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,850
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

131
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,140
A cube of sugar?
But whatever for?

132
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,060
He left it by the grating.

133
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,570
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

134
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,240
What?

135
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,070
What do you mean,
you dropped it?

136
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,250
Don't touch it.
Do you understand?

137
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,250
It's a trap.

138
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,630
They're trying to catch us!

139
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,420
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.

140
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,180
Maybe they already
know where we are.

141
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,260
Pod, we'll have to move!

142
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,930
This was such a lovely house.

143
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,440
Now we'll have to
start all over again.

144
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,270
Well, let's see how things go.

145
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,610
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

146
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,780
Why did it have to be sugar?

147
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,050
Thank you Arrietty.

148
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,310
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

149
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,980
You know I love doing laundry.

150
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,650
- I'm going to nap for a bit.
- All right.

151
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,320
"You forgot something"

152
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,280
You came back.

153
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,120
Wait, don't go.

154
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,300
Please leave us alone.

155
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,130
I wanted to tell you that.

156
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I want to talk to you.

157
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,800
Human beans are dangerous.

158
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,140
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

159
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,310
You have a family?
I envy you.

160
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,610
Don't you have one?

161
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,650
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

162
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,660
Mother's so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

163
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,160
Really...

164
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,830
My name's Sho.
What's your name?

165
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,550
Do you have one?

166
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,920
Of course I have a name!

167
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,840
It's Arrietty.

168
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,850
Arrietty... Arrietty...

169
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,850
That's pretty.

170
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,580
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

171
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,960
Just a peek. Please?

172
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,230
What's happening?
Oh my gosh, it's a crow!

173
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,190
You can't come in here!

174
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,130
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

175
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,420
Maybe it's nesting season
or something.

176
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,220
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

177
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,640
Are you all right?

178
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,810
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

179
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,650
Thanks, Haru.

180
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,480
I feel fine.

181
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,830
The nesting season, eh?

182
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,090
Have yourself
a nice long rest now.

183
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,900
Papa...

184
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,900
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.

185
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,990
I wanted to do
something to help.

186
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,700
But he didn't see me.

187
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,040
You put your family in danger.

188
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,090
I won't say it again.
Understand?

189
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Yes.

190
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,720
We'd better start looking.

191
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,650
It's time.

192
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,150
Pod...

193
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,960
"You forgot something"

194
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,190
Afternoon! Package for you.

195
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,650
Thanks again ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.

196
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,400
Listen, know any good
pest control companies?

197
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,490
Pest control?

198
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,500
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

199
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,330
Squeaky Klean Service?
Let me just write that down.

200
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,500
Haying problems with mice?

201
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,680
Maybe it's mice,
or maybe it's something else.

202
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,180
Between us, it's little people.

203
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,020
I've seen them myself.

204
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,940
A crow tried to
fly into your room?

205
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,070
I hope it didn't scare you.

206
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,870
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

207
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,700
I was so astonished!

208
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,210
I never saw such a huge...

209
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,880
Excitement's the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

210
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,170
He came here for peace and quiet.

211
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,220
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

212
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,550
I know, I know.

213
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,060
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

214
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,270
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

215
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,070
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

216
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,780
I don't mind.

217
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,070
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped.

218
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,740
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?

219
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,500
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little house in my room?

220
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,210
It's amazing.

221
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,420
You mean the doll house?

222
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,760
That doll house
belongs to your mother.

223
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,270
She left it here
when she moved out.

224
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
It was hers?

225
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,900
My father had it
made to order in England.

226
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,650
It was for the little people.

227
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,070
My father claimed he'd seen them.

228
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,280
He waited for so many years.

229
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,450
He always said that house
was a present for them.

230
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,460
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

231
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,790
Not in my father's lifetime,
nor in mine.

232
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,920
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

233
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,470
Unfortunately... no.

234
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,640
It's been in our family
for four generations.

235
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,150
If you like it,
it will be yours someday.

236
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,810
You mean it?

237
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,360
Yes.

238
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,280
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!

239
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,500
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?
- Yes'm.

240
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,180
This is the living room.

241
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,180
All the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker.

242
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,930
Isn't it wonderful?

243
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,480
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

244
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,200
But the next room
is my personal favorite.

245
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,030
Haru, could you open that up?

246
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,200
Let's see,
I think it opens this way.

247
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,710
Everything is so detailed!

248
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,210
Detailed and just like
the real thing.

249
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,510
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

250
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Beautiful, just beautiful.

251
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,720
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

252
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,390
And it's been so Long...

253
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,890
Maybe the little people
are gone now.

254
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,330
Mother, we've had
these pictures three years.

255
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,870
Don't you want new ones?

256
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,870
I love those pictures.

257
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,050
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

258
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,170
Besides, there's no point
changing them now.

259
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,390
Papa's later than usual.

260
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:45,560
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

261
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,070
- Papa?
- That's the back door.

262
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,410
Papa! Welcome back...

263
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,240
Twisted my leg.

264
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,750
It's lucky Spiller found me.

265
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,090
Pod?

266
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,760
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.

267
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,260
Does it hurt?

268
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,760
It's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.

269
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,100
I'll get some cold water.

270
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,610
Here's a towel, better dry off.

271
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,770
Who's this?

272
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,120
It's not just the
three of us after all.

273
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,960
Gotta go.

274
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,130
Wait, at least stay
and have some tea.

275
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,810
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

276
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,980
Thank you Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

277
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,820
We're so grateful for your help.

278
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,160
Listen, have you seen
other Borrowers?

279
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,330
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

280
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,120
This many.

281
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,750
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

282
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,510
Can I see your bow?

283
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,510
You use this for hunting.

284
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,520
Give that back.
It's not a toy.

285
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:05,021
<i><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</font></i>
<b><font color=red>Aldi Arman</font></b>

286
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,870
Gotta go.

287
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,670
Won't you stay
and have a bite?

288
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,880
Got this.

289
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,050
A cricket's leg!

290
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,970
Want some? It's real good.

291
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,060
No thanks!

292
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,770
Take care.

293
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,900
Thanks again.

294
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,240
I'll see him out.

295
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,250
You were looking
for a new place.

296
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,460
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

297
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,260
Really...

298
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,930
His territory reaches past the river.

299
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,640
And he knows a few
places we could live.

300
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,520
That's good I suppose.

301
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,940
I'd hate to camp out.

302
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,530
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

303
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,780
I'm glad there are
still others like us.

304
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,910
Do you have friends
and family, Spiller?

305
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,290
Family? No, just me.

306
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,290
Well, I hope you
can come again.

307
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,630
My mother's stew
is the best in the world.

308
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,360
Haru?

309
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,010
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

310
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,720
Pull it apart and do it again.

311
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,390
Why do we need
such a big sack anyway?

312
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,900
I'm going to look in on Papa.

313
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,070
Papa, can I come in?

314
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,040
How's your leg?

315
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,410
I'll be walking soon.

316
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,750
Papa?

317
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,040
Are we going to move?

318
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,760
We were seen.
We've no choice but to move.

319
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,350
I don't think every
human bean is dangerous.

320
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,100
Arrietty...

321
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:04,940
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

322
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:08,110
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

323
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,440
The other one moved away.

324
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,740
They were seen by humans.

325
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,620
No matter what happens,
we've got to survive.

326
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,790
Papa...

327
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,720
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

328
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,620
Mother!

329
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,630
It won't open.

330
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,760
The frame's buckled.

331
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,870
The... the wall!

332
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,240
Homily!

333
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,570
Homily!

334
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:23,910
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

335
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,810
Gather only the things we need.

336
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,950
We can't carry all that.

337
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,830
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house.

338
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I'll make sure it's safe.

339
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,290
- Stay with your mother.
- Yes Papa.

340
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,200
You finally came.

341
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,010
Do you like your new kitchen?

342
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,010
Our house is a disaster.

343
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,390
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

344
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,900
Can I look?

345
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,710
You're beautiful.

346
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,050
We have to move.

347
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,930
We were seen.

348
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,770
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

349
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,270
Borrowers...?

350
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,770
We borrow from human beans.

351
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,400
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.

352
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,780
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

353
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,530
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

354
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,120
No one ever saw them?

355
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,120
Probably.

356
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,130
It's all my fault.

357
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,130
Niya, don't be like that.
Be nice to her.

358
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:09,640
Are there other little people
like you in the house?

359
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,640
No, it's just my father
and mother and me.

360
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,980
What about in other houses?

361
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,980
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

362
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,690
Oh.

363
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:26,450
Soon you'll be the only one left.

364
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:30,620
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

365
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,490
You're a doomed species, you know.

366
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:38,330
That's not true!

367
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,880
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

368
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,500
Spiller?

369
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,670
He's one of us.

370
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,180
And he said there's lots more.

371
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,270
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

372
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,350
There are 6.7 billion of us.

373
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Six point seven billion...?

374
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:04,480
What about you?

375
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,860
I don't know.

376
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,030
There's probably
just a few of you.

377
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,370
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

378
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,040
Lots of species
are already extinct.

379
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,710
I've only seen them
in books, though.

380
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:27,170
So many beautiful species...

381
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,010
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

382
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:36,060
It's sad, but that's what fate
has in store for your kind.

383
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,180
Fate, you say?

384
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,400
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

385
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,530
We have to survive.
That's what Papa said.

386
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,530
So we're leaving,
even though it's dangerous.

387
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,910
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

388
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,620
We're not going
to die out that easily!

389
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,210
I'm sorry.
You're right.

390
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,550
I'm the one
who's going to die.

391
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,560
It's my heart.

392
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,770
They're going to operate
next week, but it's probably hopeless.

393
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,440
Your heart...?

394
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:29,110
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

395
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,280
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

396
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,780
I can't even do that.

397
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,830
I hope you can forgive me.

398
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,330
I didn't know
you were so sick.

399
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,280
What in the world
is this doing here?

400
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,350
It's the kitchen
from the doll house!

401
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,530
Found you!

402
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,330
What's wrong?

403
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,130
My mother... I heard her voice.

404
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,580
This really is a great kitchen.

405
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,160
You're not the only
little one here, I bet.

406
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:11,770
I have to go.

407
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:03,030
Let me out! Help me!

408
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,060
The ceiling's tilted.

409
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,480
Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?

410
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:45,110
Can you make
an urgent house call?

411
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,400
There's something small
in the house. No, not mice.

412
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,860
Not mice?

413
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:52,160
I don't want them killed.

414
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,870
You need trapping services?

415
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:57,210
Yes, that's it.
I want you to trap them.

416
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,840
Sho! Sho!

417
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,680
Arrietty!

418
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,900
Mother's gone!

419
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:27,030
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human bean got her!

420
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,450
Momma...

421
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,090
We'll find her.

422
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:23,040
It's locked.

423
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,260
Let's try the room next door.

424
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,070
Can't budge it.

425
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,440
Wait!

426
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,790
I can fit.

427
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,330
Amazing!

428
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,200
No, that's not it.

429
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:21,370
There's a dirt road.
Turn in there.

430
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,040
- Before the bridge?
- No, not that one!

431
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:35,090
Haru opened this.

432
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,550
Then she must've
taken Mother someplace.

433
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,710
Are you okay?

434
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,440
What's taking them so long?

435
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:05,720
Mother! Where are you?

436
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,160
But the lock...

437
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:25,830
Lock?

438
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,500
Could I have
some hot milk?

439
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:33,540
Okay, wait just a minute.

440
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,340
Thanks.

441
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:25,720
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

442
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,230
Mother!

443
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,350
Mother!

444
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,450
- Mother?
- Arrietty!

445
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,870
Here I am, Arrietty!

446
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,250
Mother!

447
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,090
Arrietty!

448
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:34,620
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

449
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:57,810
Another human bean!

450
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,320
It's all right, Mother.

451
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:29,680
We'd like to take a look
around first.

452
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,340
Take your time.

453
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:58,410
Now who can this be?

454
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,710
Haru? Haru!

455
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,710
What's going on here?

456
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,720
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!

457
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,340
Little people?

458
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,720
That's right.

459
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:16,390
And what little thieves they are!

460
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,570
It's really true.

461
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,870
They steal from
all over the house.

462
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,210
That's why things
were going missing.

463
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,250
Haru, what's gotten into you?

464
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:48,460
All these years I thought
it was my imagination.

465
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:50,590
Well, it wasn't.

466
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,890
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

467
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,390
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

468
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,390
You'll believe me
when you see this.

469
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,310
This is their nest.

470
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,780
Nest?

471
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,450
It looks like a pile
of old junk to me.

472
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:24,620
What? I swear I saw it.

473
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,880
Haru, I'm sending
the exterminators away.

474
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:31,590
Now, wait just a minute.

475
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,050
The doll house!

476
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,600
Young Master? May we come in
for a minute?

477
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:46,980
All right.

478
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,740
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.

479
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,120
You'll see, it's gone.

480
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,000
It's not gone.

481
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,510
Such a pleasure to look at.

482
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:30,520
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

483
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:36,530
I wonder what's gotten into Haru.

484
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,030
Hmm?

485
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,540
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

486
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:59,680
Someone was making tea!

487
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:06,060
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

488
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,560
Yes, there are.

489
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:14,020
So Haru really saw them.

490
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,690
Though she accused them of stealing.

491
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,410
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

492
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,080
I mean, I wish
I could see them.

493
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,580
I bet they're here somewhere.

494
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,590
I'm sure they are.

495
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,480
Excuse me, ma'am!

496
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,270
Where'd you like us to start?

497
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:05,620
Are you all right?

498
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,290
It got away.

499
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:13,130
I had one and it got away!

500
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:16,960
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

501
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:20,760
Next time I swear
I'll get them!

502
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:39,490
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

503
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:44,160
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.

504
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:50,160
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

505
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,010
Let's hurry.

506
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,020
I can't do it...

507
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:41,050
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

508
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,340
What?

509
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,720
I'm so sorry.

510
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:51,390
It's my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

511
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:57,230
That's in the past.

512
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:02,400
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

513
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,410
I'm going outside for a bit.

514
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:13,750
Don't go too far, now.

515
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,450
Niya!

516
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:01,850
Niya...

517
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,540
Just a little further.

518
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,900
Spiller!

519
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,420
That's everything.

520
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,750
Now let's get moving.

521
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,250
Okay.

522
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,930
Mother, are you all right?

523
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:28,440
Arrietty!

524
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,970
Sho!

525
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,310
Arrietty...

526
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,670
We're leaving now.

527
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:33,510
I'm glad I made it.

528
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,680
Niya showed me the way.

529
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:50,190
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

530
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,990
I brought this.

531
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:07,210
I hope you'll accept it this time.

532
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,380
Thank you.

533
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,400
I have to go.

534
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:33,570
When is your operation?

535
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,900
The day after tomorrow.

536
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:40,570
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

537
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,920
For luck.

538
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,090
Thanks.

539
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,600
You protected me after all.

540
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,440
Arrietty...

541
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,770
I hope you have
the best life ever.

542
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,610
Goodbye.

543
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:28,120
Arrietty, you're a part
of me now.

544
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,790
I'll never forget you, ever.
