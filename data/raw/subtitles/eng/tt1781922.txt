1
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,211
Yes, I am happy
for this opportunity.

2
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,806
And though some
of my people may not understand

3
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,008
the benefit of this,
I'm sure they will in Cardiff.

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,331
They are fortunate
to have a leader with such resolve.

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,610
And now, let us stop
talking business, Mr. Prime Minister,

6
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,047
and drink the first water
from the plant.

7
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,400
- Thank you.
- Yes.

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,961
Thank you.

9
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,526
I hope this is the first
of many projects we can build.

10
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,490
We say the dragon of fortune
has a long tail.

11
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,683
- To Cardiff.
- To your new waterworks.

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,891
- It is our great honor.
- And ours.

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,291
All of us at Cardiff are so fortunate
to be doing business with you.

14
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,964
Yes. Thank you.

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,161
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.

16
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,721
You sleeping?

17
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,206
Sweetie, what's going on?

18
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,645
Beeze.

19
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,961
Would you look at this?

20
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,571
I mean...

21
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,127
where did the energy
come from suddenly?

22
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,850
Please. Oh, my God.

23
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,291
Are we there yet?

24
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,880
According to this, we only have
eleven more soul-crushing hours.

25
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,291
Oh, shit.

26
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,249
You know you have to put
a dollar in the swear pot.

27
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,689
Uh-oh, guys.
I left the swear pot back in Texas.

28
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,081
- Shit! How could I have been so stupid.
- Dad. Dad!

29
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Jack.

30
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,806
- Where's Bob?
- Hey, what are you looking for?

31
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,727
- I can't find Bob.
- Did you look underneath?

32
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,684
You're not supposed to say
the S-H-I-T word.

33
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,165
The what?

34
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,083
- Did you just spell that?
- Yes.

35
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,650
No, you're not supposed to say it.

36
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,644
I'm allowed to say it under
special emergency circumstances.

37
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,609
- Well, actually...
- According to the rules...

38
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,127
- And it wasn't an emergency.
- ...which I make up as I go along.

39
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,170
- Where did he go?
- Sweetie, don't bother that woman.

40
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,128
- I still don't see him.
- Okay.

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,445
Uh-oh.

42
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,367
- There you go.
- Hello, Bob. Thank you.

43
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,681
- How are you?
- Good.

44
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,363
- What happened to your hand?
- Mmm.

45
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,205
Got in a fight with a tiger.

46
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,330
- Really?
- Really.

47
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,447
Don't worry, though.

48
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,364
He got it worse than I did.

49
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,090
What happened to your head?

50
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,642
Oh... fell down a flight of stairs
in Hong Kong.

51
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,929
Okay, honey, come on, sit down.
Don't bother him. Okay?

52
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,128
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Pleasure.

53
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,010
What if we don't like it here?

54
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,765
Where we're going? I think we will.

55
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,650
What if this company
goes belly-up too?

56
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,521
That's not gonna happen,

57
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,764
because this company is a lot bigger
than Daddy's company was.

58
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,729
And that's better, huh?

59
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,801
Mm-hmm.

60
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,608
They promised us a car, right, babe?

61
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,961
Yeah, they did. But I don't...

62
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,008
So can you call someone?

63
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,289
Well, this phone's supposed to work
internationally, but it's not.

64
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,762
I don't see anything. I think
we're really starting strong here.

65
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,688
- Let's just grab one of these guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

66
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,330
Okay, thank you. Yep.

67
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,801
Wait. A word to the wise here.

68
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,008
These guys are a bunch
of scam artists.

69
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,447
They just wear uniforms
to look official,

70
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,522
but they're all rob you blind,
I promise you.

71
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,250
There's an official taxi line outside.

72
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,810
I'll show you where if you like.
Come on.

73
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,848
- Great. Thank you.
- Or you'll get ripped off.

74
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,248
Don't worry, big boy. Don't worry.
Come over here. I'll show you.

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,921
Here you go.

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,083
- You forgot your bags.
- No, this is it, kiddo.

77
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,322
I like to travel light.
You know what I mean?

78
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,890
Well, that's convenient.

79
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,089
- Where are you from?
- Austin, Texas.

80
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,130
- Expats? Who do you work for?
- Cardiff.

81
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,807
I'm one of the engineers they brought
in to revamp the waterworks.

82
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,121
You Cardiff boys,
you go everywhere, don't you?

83
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,604
Where are you staying?
The Imperial Lotus?

84
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,365
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Well, everyone does. I'm there.

85
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,602
I'll give you a lift, if you'd like.
I'm meeting someone.

86
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,364
- Would you like that?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

87
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,204
Be my pleasure. Be my pleasure.

88
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,520
- Hammond's the name.
- Jack.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,011
- Nice to meet you, Jack.
- Nice to see you.

90
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,401
- Hi, I'm Annie. How are you?
- Hello, Annie, how are you?

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,925
This is Lucy, Briegel.

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,287
- But you can call her Beeze.
- Hello, Beeze.

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,931
- Do you like it here?
- I love it.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,809
I've been here 15 times.

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,167
- Wow!
- That's a lot of times.

96
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,402
Yeah, it is a lot of times.
Well, I just love it.

97
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,720
I love the women.

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,928
They're always so eager to please,
you know what I mean?

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,809
Okay. It's interesting,

100
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,645
I'm looking at our bags
and I'm thinking that we're too many...

101
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,440
- No are you kidding?
- ...pieces of luggage.

102
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,289
I think that we could maybe
just get a taxi...

103
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,165
No, don't worry about these guys.
They can fit everything on a moped.

104
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,887
It'll be great.

105
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,848
Okay, everybody, here's your ride,
right here.

106
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,166
This is the man!

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,807
- Come on.
- You're in safe hands here.

108
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,530
- I missed you.
- Look at you!

109
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
There you go.
Mind the leg. Mind the leg.

110
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,964
Good to see you.
These good folks here, they need a lift.

111
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,168
Their ride didn't show up.

112
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,366
- Yes, okay.
- Thanks.

113
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,841
But I need to ask you
very important question.

114
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,160
Okay.

115
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,449
- Do you like Kenny Roger?
- Kenny Rogers?

116
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,765
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

117
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,888
- Yes?
- Yes. Yeah.

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,247
Because this is the Kenny Roger cab.

119
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,086
Oh, my God!
I had no idea.

120
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,290
My name is
Samnang Pichairongkramgiskerong.

121
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,850
- Jack.
- Wow! I like your name.

122
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,322
Yeah? But all my friends call me...
Kenny Roger.

123
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,050
- Oh, Kenny.
- That's a little easier.

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,009
Because we look alike.

125
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,206
You do?

126
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,846
- Uncanny.
- Whoa! Separated at birth!

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,331
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

128
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,446
- Let's go. Come on.
- Here we go.

129
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
I've got the birds.

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,846
Hey, Kenny Rogers, you mind
keeping your eye on the road a little bit?

131
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,365
Thank you.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,764
- This one's on us, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

133
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,047
- All right. Be safe.
- All right.

134
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,121
You go.

135
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay.

136
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,848
- This one's pretty.
- Daddy, look, it's you.

137
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,003
- Oh, wow!
- It's your serious face.

138
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,721
I would have preferred a driver,
but it's a nice welcome.

139
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,482
Dad, this light doesn't work.

140
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,244
What do you mean it doesn't work?

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,924
I got Bob.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,526
Okay. Nope, it doesn't work.
You're right.

143
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,082
But I gotta say, I'm loving
how unpredictable this hotel is.

144
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,321
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

145
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,324
Because a lot of places you turn on
a switch, you know the light comes on.

146
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,483
Here, there's some, like, mystery.
There's a little suspense.

147
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,244
Annie, speaking of a mystery,
what is...

148
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,883
- What is this?
- It's my rice cooker.

149
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,371
I know, but we're in Asia.

150
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,649
Don't you think they're gonna have
some effective ways to cook rice?

151
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,564
This is <i>my</i> rice cooker.

152
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,211
Okay. Let's show 'em how we do it.

153
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,805
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

154
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,530
- All right.
- I wanna go swimming.

155
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,090
No, no, no, we can't go swimming.

156
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,049
In fact, you gotta get ready for bed.

157
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,442
I'm not tired,
and I really want to go swimming.

158
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,249
Okay, I'll make a deal with you guys.

159
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,084
We'll start to wind the engines down.

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,482
You guys can sit here quietly
and watch some TV.

161
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,049
We're not getting any channels.

162
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,771
- Did you...?
- We're getting snow.

163
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,126
Nothing's working!

164
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,168
All right, let's not be difficult.

165
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,685
Lucy's always been difficult.

166
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,127
Since the day she was born,
she's been very difficult.

167
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,331
- Dad.
- Guys. Guys.

168
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,084
Dad, will you tell the story of how
Lucy was born?

169
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,130
- Yeah. Sure.
- You guys like that story, don't you?

170
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,010
Well, I gotta say,
it was a difficult birth.

171
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,081
- I knew it!
- Good difficult.

172
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,207
Good difficult.

173
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,561
Do you want to call
about the television?

174
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,008
No, no, I will call.
I will tell you the story. Hold on.

175
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,048
Not difficult! Not difficult!

176
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,650
The phone's not working.

177
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,927
Okay, welcome to the Third World.

178
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,405
It's actually the Fourth World.

179
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,323
- Really?
- That's what it said in the book.

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,323
- I didn't even know that existed.
- Nor did I.

181
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,051
You didn't plug in the rice cooker.
Could that have...

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,122
- No.
- ...possibly shorted out everything?

183
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,009
You're a jerk.

184
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,765
- It's happening in the whole city.
- What's happening?

185
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,366
There's no TV or Internet
in the whole city?

186
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm afraid not, sir.

187
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,528
Have you gotten any calls for me
from Cardiff?

188
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,011
Jack Dwyer.

189
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,162
- Are the phones working?
- The phones are working, sir.

190
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,241
Okay.

191
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,004
But we have no calls
from Cardiff for you.

192
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,764
- No calls?
- Maybe better luck in the morning.

193
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,080
Okay. Thank you.

194
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,921
All right, here we go.
Here we go, here it comes.

195
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,246
Can I get a beer?

196
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,883
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

197
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,051
Thank you!

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,570
- That was great.
- Sitting over here all on your lonesome.

199
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,080
You've got all jet-lagged, have you?

200
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,805
Yeah, I'm in a little bit of a fog.

201
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,881
What about you?

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,689
Do I look like a guy
who's jet-lagged?

203
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,410
- No.
- No, no.

204
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,244
All that shit's in the mind, mate.

205
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,360
- It's all up here.
- Yep. You're right, it is. Yeah.

206
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,722
Bullshit. Joe. Joe, two shots.
Here you go.

207
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,964
I think I'm... I'm just gonna stick
with a beer.

208
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,565
No, it's not for you. It's for me.

209
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,481
Here we go.

210
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,565
Is that guy playing a Casio keyboard
on top of a grand piano?

211
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,609
Welcome to Asia.
You're gonna love it here.

212
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,648
- Really?
- There's just so much to do.

213
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,211
Well, I don't know.

214
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,806
Ten years ago
I could not have pictured myself

215
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,042
dragging my family
the other side of the world

216
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,886
to start over in some
mid-management job.

217
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,883
At least you're making a good living.

218
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,089
And... doing good.

219
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,410
Yeah.

220
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,450
I know the bill of goods
those Cardiff boys sell you.

221
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,171
You got something against
clean drinking water?

222
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,241
Apparently.

223
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,850
Maybe I do need a shot.

224
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,287
No, you don't. No, you don't.
You got the kids upstairs.

225
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,408
So what did you do, anyway?
In your better days.

226
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,881
I invented a valve.

227
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,961
Ah...

228
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,849
I know it doesn't sound very sexy,
but it was.

229
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,684
No. No, it doesn't.

230
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,129
No, but we came up with this valve
that was almost a big deal.

231
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,091
Came very close.

232
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,645
Here's to almost.

233
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,090
- Almost.
- Almost.

234
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,400
Cheers.

235
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,126
What about you?
You have any kids or anything?

236
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,611
No.

237
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,490
No. Not anymore.

238
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,566
I guess...

239
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,482
I guess I've seen better days, too.

240
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,204
Yeah.

241
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,762
On that note, I think
I'm gonna hit a strip joint.

242
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,604
- All right.
- Yeah.

243
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,084
Perhaps I should change
into my sweatpants.

244
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,731
Yeah, let them know I mean business.

245
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,370
Oh, yeah.

246
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,365
Listen, don't let the bastards
get you down, okay?

247
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,329
- All right. Thank you.
- Of course.

248
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,526
Yeah. See ya.

249
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,929
Hon, are you okay? Are you sick?

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,001
No.

251
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,208
What are you doing?

252
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,884
I'm just tired. I just...

253
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,042
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

254
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,286
No.

255
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,650
Annie, I'm sorry I didn't...

256
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,411
I wasn't trying to fool you with this.

257
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,881
- It's okay.
- I know I just...

258
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,964
I wasn't planning for things
to work out like this,

259
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,807
but I thought that
this is the best option available.

260
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,406
- Jack, I can't.
- I know. And I'm doing the best...

261
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,723
- I can't comfort you right now.
- No, I know. I'm not...

262
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,961
All right.

263
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,131
Any word from Cardiff?
Jack Dwyer.

264
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,404
I'm afraid not, sir. I'm very sorry.

265
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,682
Do you have a newspaper?

266
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,206
Our delivery did not come in
today, sir. We have none.

267
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,725
Is there some place I can go
to get one?

268
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,802
Yes. Yes, you can go
to Kampuchea Krom.

269
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,008
Okay. I don't know where that is.

270
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,086
This is where we are,
and this is Kampuchea Krom.

271
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,606
When you get to Mao Tse-Tung,
turn right. But only half.

272
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,569
- Only half.
- Yeah.

273
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,005
Newspapers, sir.

274
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,684
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

275
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,730
Do you have any newspapers in English?

276
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,928
Do you have <i>The Herald Tribune</i>
or <i>USA Today?</i>

277
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,647
Do you have any American newspapers?

278
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,401
Great.

279
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,401
Thank you.

280
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,289
This is from three days ago.
Do you have one that's newer?

281
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,361
Thanks.

282
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,686
Go, go, go!

283
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,925
What's happening?
I'm an American.

284
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,411
Get your fucking hands off of me!

285
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,891
Let go of me!

286
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,642
Get your hands off of me!
Let me go!

287
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,211
They're coming into the hotel.

288
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,406
It's not safe.

289
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,566
Put the table there.
Bring more chairs.

290
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,406
Sir, please go back to your rooms.
Until the situation is over.

291
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,011
Are you gonna even use your goggles?
I feel like you never use it.

292
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,251
- Annie?
- Coming, coming, coming.

293
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,606
Annie, open up.

294
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,762
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

295
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,649
- Is something wrong?
- Lock the door.

296
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,290
There's like a war going on out there.

297
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,361
- What?
- Come here look.

298
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,280
- Honey, slow down.
- Look, look, you see that?

299
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,243
- They're overrunning the police.
- I don't see anything.

300
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,891
- Come here. Here, look.
- You're scaring me, stop it.

301
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,566
- Can you see that smoke?
- What? No! I don't see anything.

302
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,400
Annie, they are killing people.

303
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,442
They are pulling them out
and just shooting them.

304
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,561
- Foreigners.
- Why?

305
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,483
- Just out there.
- You saw the people...

306
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,166
I don't know what's going on.
They just shot a guy in front of me.

307
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,481
- Please!
- Annie, they are here in the hotel.

308
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,130
They're in the lobby.

309
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,441
Where's Lucy?

310
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,170
- Lucy?
- Lucy?

311
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,605
- Lucy? She was right here.
- Lucy?

312
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,365
- Lucy, right now.
- She left.

313
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,930
What do you mean she left?

314
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,444
- Where did she go?
- She went to the pool.

315
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,249
You let her go to the pool by herself?

316
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,004
No, I didn't let her go down
by herself.

317
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,240
- She's been acting out.
- Stay here and lock the door.

318
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,964
- Are you sure?
- Lock the door. Lock the door!

319
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,644
Wait!

320
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,081
- It's fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Shut the door.

321
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,801
Okay, let's go put on
different clothes, honey. Okay?

322
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
It's all right, don't be scared.

323
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,686
Here we go.

324
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,411
Finish the other one.

325
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,405
You know what, Briegel?

326
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Get in the bathroom
and lock the door, please.

327
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,321
Now.

328
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,365
Get out! Get out!

329
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,448
Leave them alone!
Leave them alone!

330
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,169
No, leave them alone.

331
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,401
No...

332
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,131
Mommy?

333
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,321
Bathroom, Beeze. Now.

334
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,841
Lucy?

335
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,841
Lucy?

336
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,845
Lucy?

337
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,530
Get out of the pool.
Come here.

338
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,804
Get out of the pool.

339
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,361
Come here.

340
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,610
Get to the roof! Go!

341
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,925
Get up to the roof.

342
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,450
Annie?

343
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,443
- Jack.
- Annie, open up.

344
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,521
Jack.

345
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,084
- Shit.
- What the hell happened?

346
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,601
She's okay, she's okay.

347
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,806
We gotta get out.

348
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,088
Annie, we got to get to the roof.

349
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,731
- Come here.
- We can't, we can't leave here.

350
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,404
They are out there, Jack.

351
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,562
No, we just came...
We just came on this floor.

352
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,846
We can stay here.

353
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,082
Trust me.
We got to get them to the roof.

354
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,049
Okay? We have to go now,
trust me.

355
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,167
Please. Okay?

356
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,161
- Okay.
- We got to go.

357
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,290
- Mom! Mommy, Bob!
- No, no!

358
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,771
No, come on.

359
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,080
No!

360
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,527
- No, no.
- Stop it.

361
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,602
No.

362
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,250
Come on, go, go, go.

363
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,924
Oh, my God! It's okay.

364
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,241
Close your eyes.

365
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,450
Here we are.

366
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,123
Hold the door.
Don't let him through.

367
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,690
Open up.
We're Americans, open up.

368
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,086
I'm gonna sit over there.

369
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,646
- Are you okay?
- Okay. Here.

370
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,290
- You okay?
- Are you all right? Good.

371
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,283
Good! You girls are very good.

372
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,240
- Let me just see what's going on.
- Yeah, yeah.

373
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,448
- You know what's happening?
- We have no Idea.

374
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,363
Does somebody know
we're up on the roof?

375
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,930
- I hope so.
- Can you get a signal?

376
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,570
- I wasn't getting a signal.
- It's not working.

377
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,365
Someone over there said
the prime minister has been killed.

378
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,090
Don't go near there mate.

379
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,049
Stay back.
They'll take a shot at you.

380
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,165
What are they screaming?

381
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,481
I don't know. It's some crazy fuck
down there. He's gone ballistic.

382
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,766
We'll just hold the roof.

383
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,491
We'll kill any of those fuckers
who try to come up here.

384
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,961
Hold on, my wife speaks French.

385
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,486
Hey, Annie, this guy's
speaking French. Can you...

386
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,561
Hold on, hold on.

387
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,321
Okay.

388
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,609
- What's he saying?
- He's telling me, don't resist.

389
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,005
There's no prisoners because
they're gonna kill us anyway.

390
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,527
They keep saying it over and over again.

391
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,684
Blood for water.
Blood for water?

392
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,091
What does that mean?

393
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,969
- He doesn't know.
- He'll know, the bellhop.

394
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,567
Hey, mate, what does
"blood for water" mean?

395
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,120
They're shouting out "blood for water."
What does it mean?

396
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,361
Americans take over our water company,
and they don't like it.

397
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,725
- Listen, guys, we just got a whole...
- Cardiff?

398
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,164
Is he talking about Cardiff?
Did you know anything about this?

399
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,049
Of course not.
I thought we were here to help.

400
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,246
Dad?

401
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,449
- Are people trying to kill us?
- No, they're not trying to kill us.

402
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,807
Lucy, there are people trying
to hurt us down below.

403
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,680
- Don't tell her that.
- That's why we came up.

404
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
No, I don't want to pretend
this isn't happening.

405
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,045
We're gonna stick together,

406
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,929
and you just listen
to what your mom says,

407
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,365
and you watch out
for your little sister.

408
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,881
- Why are people trying to kill us?
- I don't know, they just are.

409
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,928
You need to keep an eye out on Beeze,

410
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,083
because she's your little sister
and she needs your help all right?

411
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,323
We just wait here
and then help is gonna come.

412
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,970
Can you hear the helicopter?

413
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,361
Jack, do you hear that?
Is that a helicopter?

414
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,249
Okay, here, you hear that?

415
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,961
- Yeah, that's a helicopter.
- We're getting out of here.

416
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,761
See, everything is gonna be okay.
Okay, right?

417
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,962
- Yeah! You okay? Are you hurt?
- Right?

418
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,530
You made me leave Bob.

419
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,364
- All right.
- We will get you another Bob.

420
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,885
I don't want a new Bob.

421
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,405
- All right.
- It's been a long day.

422
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,403
You didn't even say what the deal is?

423
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,925
Okay, how about this deal?

424
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,287
We'll get you a dog.
We'll get you a new puppy, all right?

425
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,367
- A bulldog?
- Yeah, a bulldog.

426
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,286
An ugly one?

427
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,001
Ugliest one you've ever seen.

428
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,844
- Deal.
- Deal.

429
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,601
See it?

430
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,329
Get down.

431
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,686
Keep your head down.

432
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,244
You okay? You okay?

433
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,243
Wait, Jack. Jack?

434
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,446
What are we doing?

435
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,645
Jack, what are you doing?

436
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,282
Shit!

437
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,569
Come here. Come here. Come here.

438
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,011
We'll get to the other side.
I got you.

439
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,491
- Go, go, go.
- You got it.

440
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,011
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

441
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,602
- Move.
- Okay, over here.

442
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,809
- Stay down.
- Stay right here, okay?

443
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,881
Get under here.

444
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,007
What?

445
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,800
- We got to get over to that roof.
- What?

446
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,610
- No, no fucking way.
- Annie, listen to me.

447
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,125
What are we gonna do?

448
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,600
We got to do it.
They're gonna come.

449
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,840
- We're gonna hide there.
- No.

450
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,882
When they get through that, that's it.
We're dead.

451
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,840
- Jack, no.
- Okay, over there we have a chance.

452
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,405
Over there?
We don't know what's there.

453
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,845
Over there, they're gonna be
the same kind of people.

454
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,288
All I know is, we got to keep putting
ten steps between us and them. Okay?

455
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,044
- If we stay here they'll kill us.
- Jack come on.

456
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,168
That's crazy, that's fucking crazy.

457
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,402
Look at me,
we're gonna fucking die here.

458
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,842
Listen to me, we don't have a choice.
Please, we don't have a choice.

459
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,206
- How?
- You're gonna jump first,

460
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,442
and then I'm gonna throw the kids over
one at a time.

461
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,681
Then I'm gonna follow, okay?

462
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,569
- Come on. You can do this.
- Okay.

463
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,608
- How? How?
- Come on. Right here.

464
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,526
Just get up here.

465
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,011
Right here.

466
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,010
You're gonna get a good running start,
and then you just jump it, okay?

467
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,924
- Okay.
- Don't do it, Mommy.

468
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,288
Stop, stop. Get away.
Stop. Stop, she can do it.

469
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,566
Go, go.

470
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,530
Shit!

471
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,120
- I can't, I can't.
- What are you doing? Yes, you can.

472
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,405
Annie, look at me. Just do it.
Don't think about it. Okay?

473
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,720
Stop yelling at me, Jack.

474
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,280
- Don't think about it. Look at me.
- Don't do it, Mommy!

475
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,651
- Look at me.
- Mommy!

476
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,960
Oh, man, I'm scared.

477
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,201
You okay?

478
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,328
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

479
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,243
Okay, I'm gonna send
the Beeze over.

480
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,288
- She's okay.
- No! No.

481
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,930
I need you to close your eyes
for a second.

482
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,002
- No, don't do it.
- Okay.

483
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,090
I don't want you to throw me to Mommy.

484
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,925
Okay, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it. All right?

485
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,600
What's the name
of your bulldog gonna be?

486
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,680
- Chow-chow.
- Is that a better name than Winston?

487
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,411
- You think?
- No!

488
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,329
Briegel, you okay, honey?

489
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,006
Good girl.

490
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,081
Come on.

491
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,361
No.

492
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,091
- Lucy.
- No.

493
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,286
- Lucy, come here.
- No!

494
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,169
Listen to me.

495
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,170
Listen, I got to get you to that roof.

496
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,242
If I don't, those bad people
are gonna hurt you.

497
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,086
Okay, come here.

498
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,571
- No. No!
- You can, I know.

499
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,531
No.

500
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,766
Daddy!

501
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,449
Jack!

502
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,285
- Pull up.
- Don't drop me!

503
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,362
Hold on, grab my arm.
Grab it.

504
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,683
Come on. Pull.

505
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,524
Pull.

506
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,649
Lucy, we almost went over.

507
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,200
Listen to me. If I tell you
to do something, you gotta do it.

508
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,123
- Okay?
- I'm scared.

509
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,125
I know, I'm scared too.

510
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,121
Okay, but it's gonna be okay.
Just close your eyes.

511
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,287
No.

512
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,850
- No.
- Lucy.

513
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,126
No!

514
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,081
Honey, are you okay?

515
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,724
You all right?

516
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,370
Okay, okay.

517
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,611
It's okay. Get your breath, come on.
Good girls.

518
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,806
Good girls. I'm so sorry.

519
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,681
Okay.

520
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,485
- Are you okay?
- Yep, I'm fine.

521
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,005
Okay, go, underneath.

522
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,323
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

523
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,640
Okay. All right.

524
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,121
Goddamn it.

525
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,726
Shit!

526
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,046
Right here.
We can get down here.

527
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,360
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

528
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,885
- Just ten more steps.
- Ten more steps.

529
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,928
- Just ten more steps.
- Ten more steps. Go, go.

530
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,365
Go, go, go...

531
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,970
Okay, send Lucy down.

532
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,408
Okay, I got her.

533
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,324
- You okay?
- Yeah.

534
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,290
Okay, again, here we go.
I got you. I got you.

535
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,044
Okay, let her go.

536
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,721
Okay.

537
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,561
Go.

538
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,687
- Come one.
- Okay.

539
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,603
- Put your foot right there. I got you.
- Yeah.

540
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,364
There we go. Over here.

541
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,245
Down, down, honey. Down.

542
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,880
Sit down for a second.

543
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,441
Okay.

544
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,846
Are you okay?

545
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,041
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

546
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,964
We're gonna get through this, okay?

547
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,166
I know.

548
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,606
Lucy, you okay?

549
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,204
- Okay.
- Beeze, you all right?

550
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,805
Briegel. Honey.

551
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,211
Beeze, will you look at me?

552
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,248
I want to go home.

553
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,561
I know.

554
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,849
Dad, can you tell us the story
about when I was born.

555
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,366
No, not right now honey.

556
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,646
I'll tell you later.

557
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,961
I'm hungry.

558
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,329
Hi, hungry.
I'm Dad.

559
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,164
That's not funny.

560
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,129
I'm not funny, I'm Dad.

561
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,770
Still not funny.

562
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,530
I think you're funny.

563
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,922
And that's why you're my favorite.

564
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,440
- That's mean.
- I mean, both of you.

565
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,247
- Both of you.
- Dad!

566
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,604
Come here.

567
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,488
Get down.

568
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,324
Keep down, keep down, keep down.

569
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,962
There's a tank out there.
We need to move.

570
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,087
What?

571
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,929
Come on, there's a tank.

572
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,323
In here.

573
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,881
Go! Go!

574
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,566
- Okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

575
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,086
Honey, you okay?

576
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,770
Get back, get back. Go.

577
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,086
Get back.

578
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,491
Jack? Oh... oh, shit!

579
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,244
In here, in here.

580
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,410
They're gone.
It's okay, they're gone.

581
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,049
Mommy, I have to go potty.

582
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,125
Just...

583
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,090
It's okay,
just go in your pants, okay.

584
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,964
But... I'm not a baby.

585
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,531
I know, I know sweetheart.
I know that.

586
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,601
I know.

587
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,210
Just this one time, okay.

588
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,611
But...

589
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,924
I promise it's okay.

590
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,681
It's okay, Beeze.

591
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,247
It's okay.

592
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,649
Do you know how much I love you?

593
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,007
You know, I love you.

594
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,080
Jack, nobody even knows we're here.

595
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,325
Nobody's gonna come to help us.

596
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,048
We got to get ourselves
to the American Embassy.

597
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,681
That's what we're gonna do.
We can do that. Okay?

598
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,769
We're gonna get there.

599
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,921
Okay.

600
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,885
Okay, I know, I know.

601
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,371
Come here honey. Are you okay?

602
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,566
- Here you go.
- We can't go out like this, honey.

603
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,805
Let me get something for us to put on.

604
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,921
Okay.

605
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,366
Let me look around.

606
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,170
Don't look. Please, don't look.

607
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,485
Come here. Don't look.

608
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,882
Don't look down.

609
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,685
- I don't like it here.
- I know.

610
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,767
Just stay put. Stay put.

611
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,651
Can't read this.
Can't read this map.

612
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,126
- What are you looking for?
- The Embassy.

613
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,843
- Mom, look.
- What?

614
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,046
An American flag.

615
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,603
Very good, very good.

616
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,810
Jack...

617
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,802
Okay, so here's
the American Embassy,

618
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,326
but do you know
where we are on this map?

619
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,165
We're right here, right about here.

620
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
Okay, that's, like, five blocks away
and I think...

621
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,844
Shut up.

622
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,321
Quiet.

623
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,286
Stop it.

624
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,767
Okay?

625
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,131
You can't scream.

626
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,207
You can't.

627
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,441
No!

628
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,644
Ten more steps.

629
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,208
Let me get the clothes.

630
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,921
Hey...

631
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,490
Hey.

632
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,766
Come on.

633
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,889
Couple more blocks.

634
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,210
Take a right here.

635
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,081
Jack...

636
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,331
- Turn around, turn around Jack.
- Where?

637
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,641
Don't do it.
We go back where we came from.

638
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,651
You guys,
put your head down.

639
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,721
Pull it over.

640
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,041
- Jack...
- We can't, get your head down.

641
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,282
- Stay down, stay down.
- Jack, please.

642
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,169
Please.

643
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,211
Get your head down.
Tuck your head in.

644
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,327
I'm slipping.

645
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,684
- Right here?
- Yeah.

646
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,166
- Okay.
- I can get up right here.

647
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,811
- Let's go.
- No.

648
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,644
No, we're here.
We gotta go over.

649
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,722
- This doesn't look like it.
- Why?

650
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,643
No, no, they put this
up as a defense.

651
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,802
I don't hear anything.

652
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,529
- Okay, let me take a look.
- Can I come?

653
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,489
Get behind...
No, no, listen to your mom.

654
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,291
- Get behind. I'm gonna take a look.
- What are you gonna do?

655
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,770
Be careful.

656
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,970
You okay?

657
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,050
You see anything?

658
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,964
- Hold on, let me get a better look.
- Okay.

659
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,245
Daddy!

660
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,361
Jack!

661
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,090
Daddy!

662
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,925
Annie!

663
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,650
Over here!

664
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,081
Come on.

665
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,360
Come here.

666
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,485
Okay, okay.

667
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,766
Hey, hey!

668
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,171
No!

669
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,402
Please, family.

670
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,409
Please, family.

671
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,041
Please.

672
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,760
It's okay, okay.

673
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,126
Stick close.

674
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,164
Lucy, get down.

675
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,327
We don't know where.
We find you.

676
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,005
We need that gun, wait here.

677
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,326
Daddy.

678
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,049
Don't know where.
We find you.

679
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,247
Find you, I kill you.

680
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,851
Oh, Jack, hide.

681
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,001
Oh, my God!
They'll see him. Shit!

682
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,487
Okay, girls, girls, Daddy needs help.

683
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:11,281
No matter what you hear,
you don't move from here.

684
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,361
Okay?

685
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,246
Okay.

686
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,645
Hey, okay, okay.
Hey, I'm right here.

687
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,881
Okay, okay.

688
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,530
Jack, grab it!

689
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,966
Hey, fuckhead! Hey!

690
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,731
Jack!

691
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,645
No! No!

692
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,803
No!

693
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,811
No, no, no!

694
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,405
Get the fuck of me!

695
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,531
Fucking kill...

696
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,725
No! No!

697
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,450
I'll fucking kill you!

698
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,090
Goddamn it!

699
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,764
Oh, my God!

700
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,850
Wait! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

701
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,684
Don't shoot! I got money.

702
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,842
Wait, wait, I have money.
I got money.

703
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,809
I got money, I got guns.

704
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,564
I got...

705
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,931
I can get guns.
I can get guns.

706
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,527
Sung, Sung.
Everyone likes Sung.

707
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,285
I've got one, three and five,
you've got two and six!

708
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,081
Shit!

709
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,164
Oh, my God!

710
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,765
I'm okay.

711
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,684
- I said I got one, three and five.
- Yeah, but that three there.

712
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,603
That guy over there is three.

713
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,445
- From your position, that's two.
- No, it's not.

714
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,171
The clock is based on my head,
not on my feet.

715
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,531
- You happy now?
- That's good enough.

716
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,881
All right, quickly, come on.
Everyone go.

717
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,883
- We've got to get out of here right now.
- Get the girls.

718
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,803
That guy is gonna come back,
and he'll bring friends.

719
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,167
- Now hurry.
- Come on, there's more coming.

720
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,402
- Quickly.
- It's okay, it's okay, come on.

721
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,608
There's a house I know
a few blocks from here.

722
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,047
- We'll be safe for the night.
- I'm right here honey.

723
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,285
Mommy! Mommy!

724
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,601
Hurry!

725
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,409
I'll buy you some time.

726
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,529
- Okay.
- Come on, come on.

727
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,881
Let's go.

728
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,248
- Come on.
- No, I don't want to!

729
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,243
- I don't want to go.
- Lucy.

730
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,926
This is no time to
discuss this, okay.

731
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,526
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

732
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,843
My daughter gave me this
the last time I saw her,

733
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,809
and she said

734
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,009
nothing bad would ever happen
to me as long as I wear it.

735
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,050
I'd like you to take it. Okay.

736
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,488
Okay, you're safe now.
No matter what, okay.

737
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,483
- What about Beeze?
- It'll work for Beeze.

738
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,245
It'll work for both of you.
There's nothing to be scared of.

739
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,731
You're safe now, okay?

740
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,849
Stay quiet, stay fast,
and stay close. Okay.

741
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,445
You hurt?
You've got blood right here.

742
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,851
Oh, that's not mine.

743
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,849
- Come on.
- Okay, come on. Okay.

744
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,961
Come on.

745
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,760
Here we go.

746
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,524
Keep up now, come on.

747
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,489
Here we go, upstairs.

748
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,248
- Kosal.
- Hey, Hammond.

749
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,049
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

750
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,804
Listen...

751
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,484
we're gonna spend
the night here, okay?

752
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,561
- Okay.
- Good, good.

753
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,608
Are you okay?
Would you care for some tea?

754
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,127
Yeah, a cup of tea would be nice,
maybe a drop of the hard stuff.

755
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,485
You smell lovely.

756
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,725
All right, through here.

757
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,768
Here we go, family.

758
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,842
- All right.
- It's okay, it's okay.

759
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,763
Out onto the roof.

760
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,444
We made it.

761
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,602
Glad to see you're
all in one piece, Kenny.

762
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,484
Come on up, everyone.

763
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,721
Come on, here we are.

764
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,087
Ah, you guys must be starving.
There's enough food here for everyone.

765
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,810
Come on, come sit down.

766
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,087
- Good?
- Nice.

767
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,001
Well done.

768
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,766
You like it?

769
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,286
- What is it?
- "What is it?"

770
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,601
You mean to tell me you haven't had
Kan Chow Chicken yet?

771
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,405
You're gonna love this.

772
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,084
They feed the chicken's raisins.

773
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,844
- Really?
- Really.

774
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,167
Makes the chickens taste sweet.

775
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,208
Raisins? That's interesting.

776
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,647
What do they the feed
the chickens in the US?

777
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,529
In the US?

778
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,531
Usually other chickens, I think.

779
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,966
Okay, Mom, Dad, can I have
a word with you? Just over here.

780
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,690
Yeah, yes.

781
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,683
- You should eat something.
- Come on.

782
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,721
Okay, eat.

783
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,487
- You see the river there?
- Yeah.

784
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,723
The Vietnamese border
is a couple of miles downstream.

785
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,565
If we can just get across,
they'll have to give us asylum.

786
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,484
And then we can leave
all this behind us.

787
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,561
- All right?
- Yeah.

788
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,801
Hammond, thank you.

789
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,287
My pleasure, my pleasure,
don't worry.

790
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,442
Jack I'm gonna go check
on the kids.

791
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,606
You're not just here
for the girls are you?

792
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,051
Nah.

793
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,600
Well... maybe a little.

794
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,568
You British CIA or something?

795
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,881
- Something like that.
- And Kenny he's...

796
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,200
Mm-hmm.

797
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,487
- Thanks.
- Nah.

798
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,403
No, thanks for coming
along when you did.

799
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,121
Don't thank me.
I'm the one who started this shit storm!

800
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,486
What do you mean?

801
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,963
Guys like me pave the way
for guys like you to wind up here.

802
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,327
They don't usually fight back.

803
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,165
Most of the time, they don't
even realize what we're doing.

804
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,005
- Why? What do you mean?
- We...

805
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,803
...have interests in this region.

806
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,087
- We?
- Our countries.

807
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,962
The corporations
who run them have interests here.

808
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,566
So I show up all nice and friendly,

809
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,649
offering to get them
a loan to pay for our services,

810
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,563
which we know they can't afford.

811
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,847
Then we build them power plants,

812
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,810
waterworks, freeways...
it doesn't really matter.

813
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,486
And when they can't
repay us the debt...

814
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,766
we own 'em.

815
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,528
It's all a fuck job.

816
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,764
The rebel leaders said we were
trying to enslave their people

817
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,127
by controlling the waterworks.

818
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,850
And they were right.

819
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,129
Most of those merciless
men out there...

820
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,407
they're just trying to
protect their children,

821
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,090
just like you.

822
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,650
So don't thank me.

823
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,644
I'm the one who put your
family in harm's way.

824
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,405
Least I can do is get you
out of the bloody place.

825
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,324
Is that Kan Chow Chicken there?

826
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,880
- Looks like dog.
- You need your strength, Jack.

827
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,050
They need your strength too, mate.

828
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,770
Raisins?

829
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,001
Seemed like a nice touch.

830
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,130
I killed someone.

831
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,964
You're alive, Jack.

832
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,202
Your family's alive.

833
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,647
There's no good
or bad here, there's only...

834
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,847
...just get your family the hell out.

835
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,286
Come on.

836
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,603
Get some sleep.
We leave in four hours.

837
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,601
You all right?

838
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,723
In hindsight, I probably didn't need
to bring the rice-cooker.

839
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,410
Are you kidding me?
We couldn't leave that behind.

840
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,249
Thank you for sticking with me
the last few years

841
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,802
because I know
it's not what you wanted,

842
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,008
what you hoped for.

843
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,003
If my life had been
the way I wanted...

844
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,727
I'd be in Paris.

845
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,083
I'd be in a flat in Saint-Sulpice.

846
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,685
Drinking wine.

847
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,842
Sounds pretty good.

848
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,044
But then I wouldn't have met you.

849
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,926
And I wouldn't know
those beautiful girls.

850
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,851
And the profound...

851
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,843
...thing it is to be their mother.

852
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,321
This life...

853
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,521
...has been so much more...

854
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,407
...than anything that I could have...

855
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,050
...wanted or planned.

856
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,041
If we die here tomorrow,
it will have been worth it.

857
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,322
Look at me...

858
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,164
No one's gonna die here.

859
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,927
Get to the wall, get to the wall.

860
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,684
Get down, get down, get down.

861
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,841
Okay, okay, there's
a gun tower across the street,

862
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,524
stay low.

863
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,520
There's four of them in the tower.
Now I'm gonna draw fire.

864
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,171
I want you to run
like hell for that staircase.

865
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,605
Do you understand me?

866
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,011
- You ready?
- Wait, wait.

867
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,206
- You ready?
- Okay.

868
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,009
Go!

869
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,081
No!

870
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,083
That door! Go to that door!

871
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,281
Oh, God!

872
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,485
God!

873
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,606
Keep going!

874
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,927
- Come on.
- Get across the border.

875
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,607
Just go.

876
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,682
You'll have some better days, Jack.

877
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,725
Keep going! Go!

878
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,327
Too bad I couldn't make it!

879
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,890
Shit! God!

880
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,365
Wait for it.

881
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,206
Wait for it.

882
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,925
Wait for it!

883
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,241
Come to papa, fucker!

884
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,606
Fucker!

885
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,207
Wait. Wait.

886
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,770
Hang on, hang on.

887
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,370
What are we gonna do now?

888
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,646
I don't know.
Okay.

889
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,041
I don't know.

890
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,841
What are we gonna do?

891
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,041
I don't know.

892
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,521
Annie.

893
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,771
Jack.

894
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,682
Jack.

895
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,569
Look at me. It's okay.

896
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,248
Ten more steps, remember, Jack?

897
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,361
Stay with me.

898
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,680
Stay with me.

899
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,689
Stay with me.

900
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,205
Okay?

901
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,363
We've got to go to the river.
The river.

902
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,441
Jack?

903
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,329
- Get across the border.
- Okay.

904
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,164
Okay, we're gonna keep going.

905
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,287
- Ready?
- Ready.

906
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,442
Okay? Okay.

907
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,760
The river, right?

908
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,041
Okay, stay with me, okay?

909
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,565
- Okay, come on.
- Okay?

910
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,085
- Okay.
- Come on.

911
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,844
My feet are...

912
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,885
There's the river.

913
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,291
Go ahead.

914
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,882
Get in there, go.

915
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,086
Go, go, go.

916
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,490
- What do we do?
- Stay there.

917
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,449
I'm gonna go down to the river,
and I'm gonna get a boat.

918
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,010
Okay, just wait right here.

919
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,081
Okay.

920
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,850
Boat?

921
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,242
I'll give you... give you the watch.
Watch for the boat.

922
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,004
Here look, look...

923
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,721
Gold watch, here.
Look, look, look. For the boat.

924
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,801
A thousand dollars.

925
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,844
- Shoe...
- You want the shoes?

926
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,561
Shoe.

927
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,641
Look...

928
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,088
Okay, hold on.

929
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,041
Okay.

930
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,165
Hold on.

931
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,645
Okay?

932
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,800
Okay.

933
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,402
What?

934
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,209
Where?

935
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,089
Okay, we're fine here for a second.

936
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,121
Mommy.

937
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,561
Daddy!

938
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,481
- Daddy!
- Lucy!

939
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,686
Lucy!

940
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,281
Dad, look out!

941
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,889
Hey!

942
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,281
Daddy!

943
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,886
No! No!

944
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,442
Let her go! Let her go!

945
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,202
No! No!

946
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,523
Please! She's just a kid, stop!
Please! Please!

947
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,126
Just let her go!
Please! Please!

948
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,484
No!

949
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,447
No! No! No! No!

950
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,085
No! No!

951
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,527
Please! Please! Stop!

952
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,045
Lucy! Lucy!

953
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,088
Just do it! Just do it!

954
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,450
Lucy, I'm right here, I'm right here.

955
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,562
We're together! I love you!

956
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,847
Daddy!

957
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,684
It's okay. Do it.

958
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,161
No, Daddy!
We need you.

959
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,963
No!

960
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,803
Where's the Beeze?

961
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,041
I'll go get her.

962
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,647
I'm sorry, Daddy!

963
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,843
You did great!
It's okay, it's all right.

964
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:48,288
It's okay. It's okay.

965
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,566
All right.

966
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,165
Mommy.

967
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,886
All right. Okay.

968
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,521
Come here.

969
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,851
Shit!

970
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,684
They're gonna see us, Jack!

971
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,090
Get down, get down.

972
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,850
Get down and stay quiet.

973
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:10,847
Vietnam, there's Vietnam.

974
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,086
Keep rowing.

975
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,880
Come on!

976
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,088
<i>Stop! Do not continue!</i>

977
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,209
<i>You do not have permission
to enter Vietnam!</i>

978
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,970
<i>Turn your boat around!</i>

979
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,724
Stop! Do not shoot!

980
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,280
Do not shoot!

981
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,886
<i>You do not have permission
to enter Vietnam!</i>

982
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,725
We're seeking asylum!
We're just a family!

983
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,726
We need help!

984
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,802
<i>Stop! Do not continue!</i>

985
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,251
<i>- You do not have...</i>
- Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

986
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,687
We're bringing
my family into Vietnam!

987
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,245
<i>Do not proceed any further.</i>

988
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,004
- Do not shoot!
<i>- Turn your boat around.</i>

989
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,243
We're not turning around.
Do not shoot!

990
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,731
Don't shoot!

991
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,126
<i>Lower your weapon.</i>

992
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:15,204
<i>This boat is now
in Vietnamese waters.</i>

993
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,489
<i>If you shoot,
we will consider this an act of war!</i>

994
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,167
<i>This boat is now in Vietnam!
Lower your weapon!</i>

995
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,169
Okay, it's over.

996
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,001
Okay.

997
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,804
Daddy, will you tell me
the story about how I was born?

998
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,521
Okay.

999
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,450
Well, I thought it would
be a good idea

1000
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,241
to videotape your mom giving birth.

1001
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,846
I was saying,
"Push harder, push harder,"

1002
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,248
and she gave me a look, like...

1003
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,527
You know that look
Mommy gives, like...

1004
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,648
"You're in big trouble."

1005
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,444
And then I came out?

1006
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,205
Then you came out, yep.

1007
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,725
And then they spanked me?

1008
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,566
Well, they spank all little babies
'cause they're trying to get them to cry.

1009
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,928
- But she didn't?
- She wasn't crying.

1010
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,800
So they spanked you again.
And they spanked her again.

1011
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,121
Then they tried again.

1012
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,362
- But I wasn't breathing.
- That's right.

1013
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,368
Then more doctors came rushing in,
and they brought in more machines and...

1014
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,008
The nurse said, "You might want
to turn that video camera off."

1015
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,448
And then your Dad
looked at me and said,

1016
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,965
"You need to talk to her.

1017
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:30,567
You need to tell her to breathe
because she knows your voice."

1018
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,130
"Loud."

1019
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,170
- "Say it to her."
- So I started yelling,

1020
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,924
"Breathe, Lucy.

1021
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,765
"Breathe, little Lucy, please."

1022
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,803
And then I did?

1023
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,291
- Yeah.
- And then you did.

1024
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,770
Then I brought you over to Mommy,

1025
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,081
and she held you
for the first time, and I said,

1026
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,811
"Don't worry little Lucy, you're okay.

1027
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,971
We're gonna keep you safe."

1028
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,690
Don't be sad, Daddy.

1029
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,370
I'm not sad.

1030
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,808
I'm happy.

1031
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,403
Really happy.
