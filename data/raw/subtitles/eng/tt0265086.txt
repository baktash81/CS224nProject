1
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,741
There.

2
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,945
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,139
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:09,442
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,813
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,259
Command, Super 64...

7
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,060
We got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

8
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,401
Request permission to engage.

9
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,801
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

10
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,805
Negative, command.

11
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,570
UN's jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.

12
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:38,339
Return to base. Over.
Roger.

13
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,676
64 returning.

14
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:30,225
Ready, Mr. Atto.

15
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:42,541
Leaving.

16
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,407
General Garrison?

17
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,845
No, thanks. I got one.

18
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,811
But these are Cuban.

19
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,051
Bolivar Belicoso.

20
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:56,475
So is this.

21
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,982
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

22
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,535
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

23
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,406
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

24
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:16,304
Me?

25
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,775
But am I that important?

26
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:20,736
I hardly think so.

27
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,939
You're just a businessman.
Trying to make a living.

28
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,879
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

29
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,414
You've been here, what?

30
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,551
Six weeks?

31
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:41,792
Six weeks you are trying
to catch the general.

32
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,496
You put up reward posters.

33
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:49,269
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the KO Corral?

34
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:53,502
It's the OK Corral.

35
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:58,177
Do you think bringing me in will
make him suddenly come to you?

36
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,579
Make him more agreeable?

37
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:05,147
You know where he sleeps.

38
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:09,250
You pay for his beds,
much less his militia.

39
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,124
We're not leaving
Somalia till we find him.

40
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,963
And we will find him.

41
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,664
Don't think because I grew
up without running water...

42
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,730
I am simple, General.

43
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:25,141
I do know something about history.

44
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:30,149
See all this?
It's simply shaping tomorrow.

45
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:34,777
A tomorrow without a lot of
Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

46
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:38,356
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

47
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,689
Mr. Garrison, I think you
shouldn't have come here.

48
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,197
This is civil war.

49
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,997
This is our war.

50
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,998
Not yours.

51
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,503
300,000 dead and counting.

52
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,075
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

53
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,174
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

54
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,618
How'd he strike you?

55
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,886
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

56
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,724
Yeah, he's a good catch.

57
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,562
It'll take time,
but Aidid will feel the loss.

58
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,499
I'm not sure time is something
we got in great supply.

59
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:24,733
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

60
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,164
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

61
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:31,406
They've been calling for situation
reports every morning this week.

62
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,814
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

63
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:45,992
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

64
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:47,821
I'll be your pilot today.

65
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:51,993
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

66
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:56,402
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer
program will earn 100 free credits.

67
00:09:56,606 --> 00:10:01,134
And as always, the air sickness bags
are located in the seatback in front of you.

68
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,011
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

69
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,542
You're still clear.

70
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:25,029
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

71
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:26,427
I've got some bad news.

72
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:30,333
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

73
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:33,269
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

74
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:35,445
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

75
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:39,309
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

76
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,475
If it's not in the
dictionary it doesn't count!

77
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,645
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

78
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:46,882
It does have to be in the dictionary!

79
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,289
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

80
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,992
You touch my "limo" and
I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

81
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,189
Yeah, promises.

82
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,696
That's a nice beach down there.

83
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:00,458
How's the water?

84
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:04,839
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

85
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,505
Name.
Todd.

86
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,647
Last name.
Blackburn.

87
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:18,149
First name, Todd.

88
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:21,289
So, what's it like?
What's what like?

89
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:22,720
Mogadishu. The fighting.

90
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,728
Serial number.
72163427.

91
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,595
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

92
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:35,070
Secondly, I wouldn't know about
the fighting, so don't ask.

93
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:36,662
Why not?

94
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,767
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

95
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:44,976
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

96
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:48,610
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

97
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,056
Typing.

98
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,556
Can you type?
No.

99
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:58,021
Date of birth.
2-27-75.

100
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,867
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

101
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,142
Let's bring it in.

102
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:29,590
Nice, man! Very smooth!

103
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,860
Single shot through the engine block.

104
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,228
Shit, that's a shame.
That was a nice jeep.

105
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,290
Cease fire! Cease fire!

106
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:02,985
Check your weapons!

107
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:04,218
Sergeant Eversmann.

108
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,069
Private First Class Blackburn.

109
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,393
Yeah?

110
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,064
Reporting for duty.

111
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:18,075
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be around here somewhere.

112
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:19,371
Can I leave him with you?

113
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,405
Yeah, go ahead.

114
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,683
You brought your weapon.
Yes, sir.

115
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,816
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

116
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:30,055
When did you get in?
Just now, Sergeant.

117
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:36,088
Hey, who's hungry?

118
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,953
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

119
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:05,216
Not if General Garrison is asking.
I'm asking.

120
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,618
Have a nice meal, Captain.

121
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,731
Hey, man, there's a line.
I know.

122
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,571
Well, this isn't the back of it.
Yeah, I know.

123
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:22,103
Sergeant. Sergeant.

124
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,005
What's going on here?

125
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,105
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

126
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:29,344
I'm talking about your weapon.

127
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,046
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

128
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:35,520
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

129
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,957
Well, this is my safety, sir.

130
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,732
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

131
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,632
You Delta boys are a bunch
of undisciplined cowboys.

132
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,334
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

133
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:53,304
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

134
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,435
Y'all better learn to be team players.

135
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,703
We're done here.

136
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,817
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

137
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,826
Well, this is my boot, son.

138
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:18,099
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

139
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:21,931
Is that a Jersey accent?
I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

140
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,004
Take those sunglasses off.

141
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,473
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

142
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,773
I don't want to see them on you again.

143
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,242
Is that a hot weapon?

144
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:38,952
Is that your move?

145
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:40,987
Is my hand on the piece?

146
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,791
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

147
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:48,562
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

148
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,168
Well, she's just lying in wait.

149
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:56,062
Yikes.

150
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:01,301
It's good. You're really improving.

151
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,407
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

152
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:05,604
Go ahead.

153
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,182
It's a children's book, right?
Right.

154
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:12,916
They are not supposed to scare the
living shit out of the children.

155
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,823
This is the part of the story where
our knight is slaying the dragon.

156
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,556
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

157
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,621
Thought you finished that last week.

158
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,528
You done?

159
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,596
Hey, we are at the
10-yard line here, men.

160
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:30,264
You understand?

161
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:33,267
Can you count? One, two, ten.

162
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,940
Okay? Where are my running backs?

163
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,945
Where are my running backs?

164
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,579
Hey, I didn't see you
at church on Sunday.

165
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:44,722
You had something more important to do?

166
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:47,357
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

167
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,724
I will make you believe, you understand?

168
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:06,376
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

169
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,943
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

170
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:17,219
All right, carry on.

171
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,757
I'd like a word, specialist.
Sir.

172
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:24,920
You understand why we have a
chain of command, don't you?

173
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:25,996
Roger that, sir.

174
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,558
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

175
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,662
Till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

176
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:33,865
Are we clear?
Hoo-ah, sir.

177
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,872
All right.

178
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:43,773
Listen to this:

179
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,618
If one skinny kills another his clan
owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

180
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,150
A hundred camels.

181
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:52,621
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

182
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,061
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

183
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,761
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

184
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:59,990
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

185
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,062
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

186
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:07,235
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

187
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:11,572
See, what you guys fail to realize is
the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

188
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:15,614
He believes in this mission down
to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

189
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,115
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

190
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:23,449
No food, no education, no future.

191
00:18:23,524 --> 00:18:27,120
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

192
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:28,719
We can help...

193
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:32,233
Or we can sit back and watch the
country destroy itself on CNN.

194
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,289
Right?

195
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,604
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

196
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,864
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

197
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,738
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

198
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:45,277
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

199
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:49,107
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

200
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:56,521
Stay away from the cans!

201
00:18:56,758 --> 00:18:59,124
Die, gas-pumper!

202
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:01,591
Stay away from those cans!

203
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:08,629
No, no, stay back.

204
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:11,696
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

205
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:16,711
John, it's okay.
John, it's okay. It's okay.

206
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,926
Well, he'll be fine.
But not in this army.

207
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,592
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

208
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:16,732
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

209
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,007
You got a problem with that?
No, sir.

210
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:22,170
It's a big responsibility.

211
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:24,807
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

212
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,941
Their lives depend on it.

213
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,247
All right.

214
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,890
Rangers lead the way, sir.
All the way.

215
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:34,524
Good luck.

216
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,837
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.

217
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:26,406
I say "may" because
we all know by now...

218
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:29,877
With the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

219
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,915
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

220
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,812
Two tier-one personalities
may be present:

221
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,316
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

222
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,988
And Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

223
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,055
These are the guys we're after.

224
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,298
Today we go.

225
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:51,359
Same mission template as before.

226
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:55,700
1545, Assault Force Delta will
infiltrate the target building...

227
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,104
And seize all suspects within.

228
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:02,213
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

229
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:04,546
Will rope in at 1546...

230
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:08,051
And hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

231
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:09,919
No one gets in or out.

232
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,714
Extraction Force:

233
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:16,553
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee
column will drive in at 1547...

234
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:20,699
On Hawlwadig Road and hold
just short of the Olympic Hotel.

235
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,367
Wait for the green light.

236
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,435
Now once Delta gives the word...

237
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:29,371
McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

238
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,344
Immediately after the
prisoners are loaded...

239
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:36,609
The four Ranger chalks will collapse
back to the target building...

240
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,216
Load up on humvees...

241
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:42,287
And the entire ground force will
exfil the 3 miles back to base.

242
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,821
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

243
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:51,762
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

244
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:56,027
But Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

245
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:58,068
Too high-profile.

246
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:01,468
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

247
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,905
With miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

248
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:05,511
Colonel Harrell.

249
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:10,048
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

250
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:13,385
And I will coordinate ground forces.

251
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:15,019
Colonel Matthews.

252
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,389
Mission launch code word is Irene.

253
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,849
Questions?

254
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:24,429
Which building is it, sir?

255
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:28,561
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

256
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:34,198
I don't choose the time
or place of their meetings.

257
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:36,173
I didn't say a word, sir.

258
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:39,879
Make no mistake, once you're
in the Bakara market...

259
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:42,348
You're in an entirely hostile district.

260
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:45,251
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

261
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:49,083
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

262
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:53,924
So remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

263
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:56,360
Now, let's go get this thing done.

264
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,094
Good luck, gentlemen.

265
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,975
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

266
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,371
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

267
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:12,036
Afternoon when they're
all fucked up on khat...

268
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:16,379
Only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice...

269
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:19,653
What's not to like?
Life's imperfect.

270
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:23,588
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

271
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:27,490
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

272
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,965
What the fuck, Smith?

273
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,837
Well?
Well, what?

274
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,473
We going?

275
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,608
Why should I tell you that?
Because I'm me.

276
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:19,644
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

277
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,375
Bakara market.
All right.

278
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,453
Listen, Smith, I need you to back
me up out there today, all right?

279
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,851
Keep sharp.

280
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,654
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

281
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,229
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

282
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,163
Nothing.

283
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:44,374
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

284
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,172
This, my friend, is a science.

285
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,880
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

286
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,210
About "be all you can be."

287
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,217
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

288
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,719
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

289
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,756
Got to be a Ranger.

290
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:07,296
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

291
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,661
What happened to you?
Ping-Pong accident.

292
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,028
What?

293
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,373
So guess what.

294
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,775
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

295
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,608
You're fucking me.

296
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,317
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

297
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:28,681
Sergeant Eversmann said to
get your stuff and get ready.

298
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,824
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

299
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:33,323
Oh, yeah.

300
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,186
Hell, yeah.

301
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:40,059
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and
give him ammo when he needs it.

302
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,430
Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah.

303
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:46,028
I wouldn't worry about that.
Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

304
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:50,175
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

305
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,503
Might even be fun.

306
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:55,480
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

307
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,449
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

308
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:03,188
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

309
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:06,825
But, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

310
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:10,430
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

311
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,260
We're elite.

312
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,094
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

313
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:17,932
Any questions?

314
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,006
We're going to be okay.

315
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,678
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

316
00:27:49,037 --> 00:27:53,030
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

317
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:02,415
You won't need that, either.

318
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:04,851
We'll be back before dark.

319
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,647
You might as well take
dope and beer instead.

320
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:09,120
What?

321
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:11,258
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

322
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,168
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

323
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:23,463
You don't need another 12.

324
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:28,043
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

325
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:29,635
Well, I better keep mine in.

326
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:30,710
Grimes.

327
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:32,972
Most important thing:

328
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:36,381
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

329
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,357
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

330
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:52,058
That's bad luck.
No, it's smart.

331
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:54,165
All Delta do that.

332
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,962
That's bad luck too, man.

333
00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:58,599
Come on, let's go.

334
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,012
It's a good thing you're
right-handed, Adonis.

335
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:11,349
If not, I don't know what you'd do.
You're a funny guy, man.

336
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,788
I'm not taking no death letter.
We have a deal.

337
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,586
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

338
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:25,029
Blackburn, you okay?
Excited.

339
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:29,995
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

340
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:32,399
You ever shot at anybody before?

341
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:33,965
No, sir.

342
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,807
Me neither.

343
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,516
Think he's reliable?

344
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:16,111
Well, we'll see.
It's his first time out.

345
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,664
Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
Yes, sir.

346
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:28,563
Tell him to turn his radio off.

347
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:31,626
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

348
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:42,607
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

349
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,384
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

350
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:50,945
Pick up if you're there.

351
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:54,793
I'm just calling to make
sure everything's all right.

352
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,828
I'll call you in a couple hours.

353
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,799
You'd better not be sleeping.

354
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:03,098
Your move, Randy.

355
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:06,362
I'm missing you.

356
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,170
I love you, baby.

357
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,941
Hello? Hello?

358
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,408
Thanks, bud.

359
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,684
You know, it's kind of funny.

360
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:23,415
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

361
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,056
Could almost be a good place to visit.

362
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:28,592
Almost.

363
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:34,325
You don't think we should be here.

364
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,729
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

365
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:45,444
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

366
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,740
Just goes right out the window.

367
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:50,543
I just want to do it right today.

368
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:55,019
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

369
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:24,082
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

370
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:25,719
Abdi, come in.

371
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:28,689
Abdi, can you hear me?
Is this the place?

372
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:34,222
Abdi, come in.

373
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:42,128
Can you hear me? Abdi.

374
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:45,896
Abdi, come in.
Is this the place?

375
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,576
To my right side, above the cafe.

376
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:51,208
He says this is the building.

377
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:52,879
He's certain?

378
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:55,313
Abdi, you need to be sure.

379
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,915
Are you sure?

380
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:02,922
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

381
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,760
But there's too many militia.

382
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,661
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

383
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,160
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

384
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,734
But if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

385
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,699
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

386
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:21,434
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

387
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:24,674
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

388
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:28,078
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

389
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:31,348
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

390
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:34,618
And we wait until extraction
of prisoners is complete here.

391
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,658
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

392
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:40,254
Load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

393
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,159
Home in an hour. Okay?

394
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:46,666
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

395
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:50,002
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

396
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:51,869
Hoo-ah.

397
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:08,019
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

398
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:24,004
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

399
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:28,210
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

400
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:33,310
He sounds scared shitless.
Good. That's always a good sign.

401
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,890
That's it. That's our signal.

402
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,396
All right.

403
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,664
All QRF out of the airspace.

404
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,198
All QRF out of the airspace.

405
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,539
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

406
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:16,653
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready.
Star 41 up and ready.

407
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:18,123
Irene!

408
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:20,264
Copy, Irene.

409
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:22,430
Fucking Irene!

410
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:37,146
Come on.

411
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,050
Good luck, boys.

412
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,558
Be careful.

413
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,053
No one gets left behind.

414
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:52,295
What's wrong?

415
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:56,296
Nothing.
He's just never done that before.

416
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:58,771
Aw, fuck!

417
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:04,069
Let's go.

418
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:07,842
Sergeant Struecker.
Let's roll.

419
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:48,375
Two minutes.

420
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:50,979
Two minutes.

421
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:38,722
Why are they burning tires?

422
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,864
Signals to the militia
that we're coming!

423
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:47,369
Okay, 56, looks like there's
some friendlies on the ground.

424
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:50,498
Looks like I've got
a tally on the voice.

425
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:58,313
One minute.

426
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:00,913
One minute.

427
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:06,655
What's that for?

428
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,929
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

429
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,827
Touching base.

430
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,294
Two feet, one foot...

431
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:52,402
Clear.

432
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:56,500
Little birds touching down at target.

433
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:42,147
Ropes!

434
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:45,916
Go! Go! Go!

435
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,631
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

436
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,138
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

437
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:13,446
Down! Get down!

438
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,419
Down! Stay down!

439
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,354
Get down! Everybody down!

440
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:18,860
You, down!

441
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,086
Get down!

442
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,187
On the floor.

443
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:28,970
Let's go, let's go!

444
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:32,739
Grimesy! No fear!

445
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:34,807
Oh, yeah, right!

446
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:41,381
Rangers securing perimeter.
Four corners.

447
00:42:41,718 --> 00:42:44,312
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

448
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,979
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

449
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:48,387
Well, shoot back!

450
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:55,290
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

451
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:58,164
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

452
00:42:58,235 --> 00:43:02,331
Super 62, take up an overhead
pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.

453
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:05,907
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

454
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:15,210
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

455
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:16,814
Go, Blackburn!

456
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:20,517
RPG!

457
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,191
Hold on!

458
00:43:25,162 --> 00:43:26,356
No!

459
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:38,866
C-2, we got a man fallen.

460
00:43:39,477 --> 00:43:41,968
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

461
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,577
Take up overhead pattern to
provide sniper cover. Over.

462
00:43:45,817 --> 00:43:48,081
Roger that. 61 coming out.

463
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,654
13, go ahead. I need you to
move to the north of the street.

464
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:56,486
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

465
00:43:57,796 --> 00:43:59,559
Doc! Doc Schmid!

466
00:43:59,964 --> 00:44:01,329
Come on!

467
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:04,091
Schmid, we got a man hit.

468
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:09,006
Where's he hit?
He's not. He fell.

469
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:11,043
What?
He fell.

470
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,077
Why aren't you shooting?

471
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:18,113
We're not being shot at yet!

472
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,749
How can you tell?

473
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:21,511
A hiss means it's close.

474
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:23,020
A snap means...

475
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,052
Now they're shooting at us!

476
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,027
Galentine!

477
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:41,465
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

478
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:45,173
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25.
Come in. Over.

479
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:47,142
Blackburn, can you hear me?

480
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:50,475
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

481
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:52,217
I can't get him!

482
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,712
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

483
00:44:56,823 --> 00:44:58,814
We need to get him out of here! Over.

484
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:01,986
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

485
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:05,254
We've got a man down! Over.

486
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:10,030
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

487
00:45:10,504 --> 00:45:13,200
Man down!
Missed that, 25.

488
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:15,104
Fuck it.
Say again.

489
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:17,405
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

490
00:45:17,477 --> 00:45:20,878
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

491
00:45:21,114 --> 00:45:22,479
What did he say?

492
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:26,516
Super 61, we got a man
wounded on the ground.

493
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:30,290
Stretcher!
Get me a stretcher!

494
00:45:30,525 --> 00:45:32,356
Come on. Stretcher.

495
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:33,892
Come on, come on!

496
00:45:34,796 --> 00:45:36,354
Grab this end!

497
00:45:37,732 --> 00:45:39,359
Let's go!

498
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,169
All right.
Go.

499
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,938
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

500
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:46,803
Up to the humvees! Now!

501
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:52,539
Go! Go!

502
00:45:54,415 --> 00:45:56,542
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

503
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,084
Secure!
Let's move out!

504
00:46:03,157 --> 00:46:05,352
Everybody up! Let's go!

505
00:46:05,593 --> 00:46:06,924
Come on!

506
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:08,655
Let's go! Let's move!

507
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,359
Grimes, run!
All right.

508
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:21,108
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

509
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:24,608
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

510
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,942
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

511
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:31,880
Kilo 64, green light.

512
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:35,520
Ready for extraction. Over.
Roger that. Will relay.

513
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:38,023
That's it. We got them.

514
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:41,595
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

515
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:44,625
Roger that. There's the call.
Let's move out!

516
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,664
Let's move out!
Hold on.

517
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:11,385
How much longer?
Five minutes, sir.

518
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,053
What?
Five minutes.

519
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:14,756
Nothing takes five minutes!

520
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,703
What happened to him?

521
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:25,104
He fell! Missed the rope!
How'd he do that?

522
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:29,106
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

523
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,446
Let's go! Let's move it!

524
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,776
Move, move! Come on! Move!

525
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,318
Get him in there!

526
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:38,878
Get ready to move!

527
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,447
Go! Everybody move! Move!

528
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,089
Get the fuck up!

529
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,653
Grimes! Come on!

530
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,225
Grimes! Grimes!

531
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,904
Fuck this!

532
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,260
Fuck!

533
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:30,168
Let's go.

534
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:31,969
Come on!

535
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,210
Go! Move it!

536
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:35,435
Move!

537
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:38,810
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

538
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,942
He looks real bad.
I need to evac now.

539
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,484
Roger that, Uniform 64.

540
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:45,246
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

541
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:46,881
Roger that.

542
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,556
I need extra security on these humvees!

543
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:52,722
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

544
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:53,822
Do it.

545
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:56,125
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

546
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:04,404
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

547
00:49:05,745 --> 00:49:07,007
Move out!

548
00:49:24,363 --> 00:49:26,854
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

549
00:49:26,932 --> 00:49:29,197
I don't want to talk
about it now, Colonel!

550
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:30,634
I'm busy.

551
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:00,824
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

552
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:03,802
Christ, he's fucked up!

553
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,335
Is anyone hit?

554
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:07,240
Struecker, talk to me!

555
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:09,003
It's Sergeant Pilla!

556
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:11,001
What's his status?

557
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:13,378
What's his status?

558
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:15,312
He's dead.

559
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,647
He's dead.

560
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,309
Pilla's dead, sir.

561
00:50:21,656 --> 00:50:26,593
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

562
00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:28,585
Roger that.

563
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:31,254
Get on that 50!

564
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:33,694
Someone get on that 50!

565
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:35,334
It's mine.

566
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:24,915
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

567
00:51:32,162 --> 00:51:33,527
Stay with it!

568
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:37,193
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

569
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:42,167
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

570
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,000
You want to pull those
PCLs off-line or what?

571
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,507
Right, babe.

572
00:51:49,512 --> 00:51:50,501
Come on.

573
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,851
61, going down.

574
00:51:59,022 --> 00:52:00,284
61 going down.

575
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:02,790
61 is going down.

576
00:52:04,227 --> 00:52:06,560
Super 61 is going down.

577
00:52:07,097 --> 00:52:09,065
Super 61 is going down.

578
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,133
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

579
00:52:12,303 --> 00:52:14,100
61's going down.

580
00:52:16,473 --> 00:52:17,997
Hold on!

581
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:43,498
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

582
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:47,999
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

583
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,174
Super 61 is on the deck now.

584
00:52:51,176 --> 00:52:53,770
Get an MH-six on site.
Check for survivors.

585
00:52:54,012 --> 00:52:55,843
Send in the SAR bird.

586
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,813
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

587
00:52:59,884 --> 00:53:01,943
Can you guide the convoy in there?

588
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,146
Roger that.

589
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,552
Well, move quick.

590
00:53:05,657 --> 00:53:08,125
The whole city will be
coming down on top of them.

591
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,794
Star 41, come inbound and see if
you can land at the crash site.

592
00:53:12,998 --> 00:53:15,330
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

593
00:53:27,346 --> 00:53:29,143
We just lost the initiative.

594
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,354
25, this is 64. Over.

595
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,355
25. Over.

596
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:43,257
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

597
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:45,987
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

598
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:49,494
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

599
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:53,469
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

600
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:56,906
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

601
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:01,605
25, do you read me? Over.

602
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,613
Galentine! Schmid!

603
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:05,877
Get Yurek.

604
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,381
Get Twombly.

605
00:54:07,654 --> 00:54:09,952
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

606
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:11,920
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

607
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:14,960
Hold this corner and then
exfil with the humvees.

608
00:54:15,162 --> 00:54:18,996
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

609
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:21,592
How come I got to stay back here?

610
00:54:21,735 --> 00:54:23,464
Because you're dependable.

611
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,900
All right...

612
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:28,938
Let's go!

613
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,081
I hate being dependable, man.

614
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:54,058
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

615
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:56,432
Women and children among them. Over.

616
00:54:56,537 --> 00:54:57,765
Hit the wall.

617
00:55:13,888 --> 00:55:15,788
Incoming!

618
00:55:21,462 --> 00:55:22,895
Grenade!

619
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:40,175
Go.

620
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:53,020
We still got guys inside!

621
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:54,820
I'll go to the crash.

622
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,830
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

623
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:01,333
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

624
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,634
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

625
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:05,537
Roger that.
Follow my lead.

626
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:08,202
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

627
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,940
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

628
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:15,614
All right, we need to move out now!

629
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:18,916
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

630
00:56:18,988 --> 00:56:20,216
Let's move out!

631
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,689
Moving out! Go!

632
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,800
Get in! Get in!

633
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,262
Move!

634
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:47,240
Eight o'clock!

635
00:57:01,232 --> 00:57:03,530
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

636
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:20,781
Grimes. You okay?

637
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:22,380
Yeah!

638
00:57:24,456 --> 00:57:25,821
Let's go, Maddox.

639
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,623
C-2, convoy's moving out.
Roger that.

640
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:31,421
Maddox, look at these jerks!
These idiots!

641
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:34,223
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

642
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,299
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

643
00:57:46,678 --> 00:57:48,475
Hey, Twombly!

644
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:50,303
What?

645
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,006
I think they've forgotten us.
What?

646
00:57:53,218 --> 00:57:54,708
It doesn't matter.

647
00:58:02,428 --> 00:58:07,195
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in on all sides.
They need help now.

648
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:12,267
Indigenous personnel advancing
to Wolcott crash site.

649
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:14,935
Say again. Over.

650
00:58:15,007 --> 00:58:17,305
A lot of people closing in.

651
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:22,206
How far is Chalk Four
from the crash site?

652
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:25,542
Six blocks, sir.
They need to haul ass.

653
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,274
Get down! Get down!

654
00:59:22,377 --> 00:59:24,072
Scotty, are you okay?

655
00:59:26,114 --> 00:59:27,581
No, don't go back!

656
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:39,350
Get down! Get down!

657
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:43,060
Technicals!

658
00:59:43,398 --> 00:59:44,888
Got them!

659
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:53,903
Six o'clock! Move, move!

660
01:00:15,931 --> 01:00:17,922
Go, go, go!

661
01:00:23,505 --> 01:00:24,699
Go, go!

662
01:00:28,043 --> 01:00:29,510
Come on!

663
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,715
Yurek, leaving!

664
01:00:42,692 --> 01:00:43,852
Come on!

665
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:14,945
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

666
01:02:15,487 --> 01:02:19,514
Romeo 64, I need to know before
I get to the goddamn street!

667
01:02:19,724 --> 01:02:22,318
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

668
01:02:22,527 --> 01:02:27,123
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

669
01:02:27,399 --> 01:02:30,232
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

670
01:02:30,368 --> 01:02:32,097
We can't slow down!

671
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,038
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

672
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:38,971
So get me my fucking
directions to the crash site!

673
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:43,072
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

674
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:45,840
Get your ass in the right place,
goddamn it!

675
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:49,317
What in the hell is the
status of Struecker's humvees?

676
01:02:49,422 --> 01:02:52,357
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

677
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:55,187
ETA to base momentarily.

678
01:03:02,034 --> 01:03:03,467
Open the gate!

679
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:27,819
Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on.

680
01:03:30,497 --> 01:03:31,930
Watch his head.

681
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:33,364
Easy.

682
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,039
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Get him to a medic.

683
01:04:18,546 --> 01:04:22,073
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

684
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,242
Roger that.

685
01:05:02,591 --> 01:05:03,956
I got you.

686
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,720
Easy.

687
01:05:12,935 --> 01:05:14,800
Galentine, you all right?

688
01:05:14,937 --> 01:05:18,704
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

689
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:20,402
Full cover!

690
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,222
How many are in there?

691
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:39,056
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

692
01:05:39,262 --> 01:05:42,754
He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
All right. Go ahead.

693
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:18,796
26, this is 25.
Is that you shooting up the technicals?

694
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,462
This is 26. Roger that.

695
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:25,635
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

696
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:28,538
This is 26. Roger that.
Moving there now.

697
01:06:28,746 --> 01:06:30,043
Move out!

698
01:06:32,783 --> 01:06:35,183
Captain Steele, come in.

699
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:38,753
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

700
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:43,754
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

701
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:45,721
We need a medivac now!

702
01:06:46,198 --> 01:06:51,534
It's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

703
01:06:52,337 --> 01:06:53,531
Where are the humvees?

704
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:56,574
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

705
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:59,769
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

706
01:07:11,857 --> 01:07:15,554
Get the 50 up!
You should see the crash directly ahead.

707
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,229
All I see is a roadblock!

708
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,799
I'll have to figure out another way.

709
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:50,290
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

710
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,145
Fire your weapon, Othic!

711
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:27,361
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

712
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:38,269
Medic!

713
01:08:39,047 --> 01:08:40,207
Hoo-ah!

714
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:11,001
Medic! Medic!

715
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:15,709
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

716
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:21,520
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

717
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,853
Keep going straight 200 meters.

718
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,186
Roger that.

719
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,060
Let's go!

720
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,589
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

721
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,410
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

722
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,924
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

723
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,654
What?

724
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:03,965
Were we supposed to go to them?

725
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:06,127
I thought they were coming to us.

726
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:10,930
I think we're supposed to go to them.
Shit.

727
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:15,835
Let's go to the crash site.

728
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:16,901
Okay.

729
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,516
Don't fire that thing so close to my head.
I can barely hear as it is.

730
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,572
Move out.

731
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,292
Shit! Get down!

732
01:10:38,436 --> 01:10:41,928
What did I just tell you?
If you do that again...

733
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:48,302
You okay? Nelson.

734
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:51,278
You all right?

735
01:10:51,816 --> 01:10:54,944
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

736
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:07,753
Go!

737
01:11:12,236 --> 01:11:13,726
Go, go!

738
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:19,566
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

739
01:11:19,745 --> 01:11:23,078
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

740
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:25,408
Advise you to come out now.
Roger.

741
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:27,316
Dropping last man.

742
01:11:29,921 --> 01:11:34,153
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00.
Can you see them?

743
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:36,587
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

744
01:11:46,671 --> 01:11:47,933
68 coming out.

745
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:52,307
Super 68 is out. Over.

746
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:04,781
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

747
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:06,888
Both pilots are dead.

748
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:10,821
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

749
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:12,828
We'll kill them just carrying them.

750
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:15,299
Stabilize in here?
Roger.

751
01:12:15,668 --> 01:12:18,796
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

752
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:20,998
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

753
01:12:21,073 --> 01:12:24,565
Super 64, come inbound and
take Wolcott's position.

754
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:27,843
Roger. 64 is inbound.

755
01:12:55,008 --> 01:12:56,600
Super 64, you all right?

756
01:12:56,677 --> 01:12:59,475
This is Super 64. We're good.

757
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,547
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

758
01:13:02,749 --> 01:13:04,740
Instrument panels are okay.

759
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:08,886
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

760
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:14,093
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

761
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:15,551
Roger.

762
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:22,397
I'm getting movement in these pedals.
Check the systems again.

763
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:40,076
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

764
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:41,950
64 is going down!

765
01:13:43,091 --> 01:13:44,615
64 is going in hard.

766
01:13:46,461 --> 01:13:48,190
64 going down.

767
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:54,967
We're going down.

768
01:13:59,942 --> 01:14:01,842
Get Struecker's column back out there.

769
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:04,209
They need to get to
Durant's crash site fast.

770
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,908
Another bird down.
I want them out of there.

771
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:08,583
All of them.

772
01:14:12,922 --> 01:14:16,050
Captain Steele, we got to
move or we'll get pinned down!

773
01:14:16,325 --> 01:14:18,316
We're moving as fast as we can.

774
01:14:18,427 --> 01:14:21,590
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

775
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,731
Fuck! Fuck!
Ruiz stay down.

776
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:33,969
I fucking knew...
Medic.

777
01:14:34,044 --> 01:14:37,810
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

778
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:40,345
We'll rally at the gray building.
Coming through.

779
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:40,940
Sarg'nt!

780
01:14:41,184 --> 01:14:42,344
All right, let's move!

781
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,488
Cover me!

782
01:14:55,332 --> 01:14:57,994
Let's go, let's move!
Moving out.

783
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:04,230
Friendly!

784
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:06,036
Friendlies coming through!

785
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:08,475
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

786
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:10,612
Come on, come on!

787
01:15:11,114 --> 01:15:12,138
Come on!

788
01:15:19,824 --> 01:15:21,519
Move up! Go! Move up!

789
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:23,655
What the fuck are you doing out there?

790
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:26,424
Doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

791
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:29,562
We got to get on that street,
and we got to move!

792
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:32,094
And you have got to keep up, sir!

793
01:15:32,269 --> 01:15:34,430
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

794
01:15:34,505 --> 01:15:36,973
We are combat ineffective, understand?

795
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,099
We got too many wounded to move!

796
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:42,407
Then give me some shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

797
01:15:45,116 --> 01:15:47,607
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

798
01:15:47,785 --> 01:15:48,809
Yes, sir!

799
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,457
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

800
01:15:53,025 --> 01:15:55,289
The rest of you, secure this position!

801
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:57,724
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

802
01:15:57,796 --> 01:16:00,321
Then we'll rally at
the crash site. Roger!

803
01:16:00,532 --> 01:16:01,897
My guys, let's go!

804
01:16:32,832 --> 01:16:35,824
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

805
01:16:35,902 --> 01:16:38,598
Volunteering to secure crash site two.
Over.

806
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:43,402
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

807
01:16:45,244 --> 01:16:49,180
We don't see anything moving down there,
we don't even know if anyone's alive.

808
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:53,180
A ground team is being
organized to go in now.

809
01:16:53,352 --> 01:16:55,081
ETA on ground team? Over.

810
01:16:55,254 --> 01:16:58,348
Unknown, not long.

811
01:16:58,524 --> 01:17:00,856
Do what you can from the air.

812
01:17:04,864 --> 01:17:06,627
All right, gather around!

813
01:17:06,766 --> 01:17:09,997
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

814
01:17:10,069 --> 01:17:12,197
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

815
01:17:12,272 --> 01:17:14,672
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

816
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:17,103
We're wasting time here.

817
01:17:17,277 --> 01:17:20,303
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

818
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:23,379
Sizemore, where are you going?

819
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:26,283
With you guys.
Not with that cast on you're not.

820
01:17:27,154 --> 01:17:30,453
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

821
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:33,920
Talk to me.

822
01:17:34,228 --> 01:17:35,593
I can't go back out there.

823
01:17:35,662 --> 01:17:40,224
Thomas, everyone feels the
same way you do. All right?

824
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:43,631
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

825
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:46,161
It's your call.

826
01:17:46,607 --> 01:17:47,665
Hoo-ah?

827
01:17:53,848 --> 01:17:55,076
Hoo-ah.

828
01:18:11,432 --> 01:18:15,061
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

829
01:18:24,045 --> 01:18:25,979
Sergeant Struecker!

830
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:29,981
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

831
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,319
You got some ammo?
Roger, Sarge!

832
01:18:32,488 --> 01:18:34,080
Hop in!

833
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,472
Wait!

834
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,571
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

835
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,530
Which way?

836
01:19:26,543 --> 01:19:29,535
That way, I think!
Not so fucking loud.

837
01:20:03,314 --> 01:20:04,645
Nice donkey.

838
01:20:23,267 --> 01:20:24,666
Rangers?

839
01:20:25,169 --> 01:20:26,158
Who?

840
01:20:27,004 --> 01:20:30,566
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

841
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,141
Fuck!

842
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:34,904
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

843
01:20:35,147 --> 01:20:38,241
Come to us!
Fuck you, come to me.

844
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:52,027
Sorry, Sarge!

845
01:20:52,197 --> 01:20:54,131
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

846
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:56,064
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

847
01:20:56,134 --> 01:20:58,466
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

848
01:20:58,537 --> 01:21:01,904
Because you said: "You won't need that,
we'll be back in a half-hour."

849
01:21:01,974 --> 01:21:03,532
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

850
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,599
Nelson, cover this way.

851
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:07,570
We'll need night vision.

852
01:21:07,646 --> 01:21:10,047
What's the matter with you?

853
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:13,180
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

854
01:21:13,486 --> 01:21:15,750
We need to get out of here!
That way.

855
01:21:15,822 --> 01:21:19,485
We can't be far from the crash.
Which way?

856
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,888
I thought you might know.

857
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,061
Let's move out.

858
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:32,195
Nelson, Twombly?
Come in. Over.

859
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:37,470
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.

860
01:21:38,511 --> 01:21:40,775
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

861
01:21:41,014 --> 01:21:43,676
Sir, let's get the fuck
out of here and evac!

862
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:48,211
Let's move out.
Back to the stronghold!

863
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:49,444
Come on!

864
01:21:51,725 --> 01:21:54,956
Ground forces have occupied several
buildings along Marehan Road...

865
01:21:55,029 --> 01:21:56,724
But they're all spread out.

866
01:21:56,797 --> 01:22:01,234
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a
perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

867
01:22:01,468 --> 01:22:03,800
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

868
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:08,107
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

869
01:22:08,175 --> 01:22:09,699
They're banged up pretty bad.

870
01:22:09,777 --> 01:22:14,646
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they'll be able to move.

871
01:22:14,882 --> 01:22:17,373
Sergeant Sanderson and
a small Delta team...

872
01:22:17,451 --> 01:22:21,319
Are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

873
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,493
Draw off fire!

874
01:22:33,568 --> 01:22:36,628
When this asshole stops
to reload, cover me!

875
01:22:36,838 --> 01:22:38,271
Go!
Sir.

876
01:22:41,776 --> 01:22:42,743
Again!

877
01:22:47,849 --> 01:22:49,316
Loading!

878
01:22:51,686 --> 01:22:53,176
Keep going!

879
01:22:53,922 --> 01:22:55,651
I'm jammed!

880
01:22:56,825 --> 01:22:58,292
I got it!

881
01:22:59,527 --> 01:23:01,290
No, shit!

882
01:23:13,876 --> 01:23:15,138
RPG!

883
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:32,652
You all right? You okay?

884
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:35,797
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

885
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:39,629
Come on! Come on!

886
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,359
Go!

887
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:52,548
A crowd is advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

888
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:54,947
Shughart and Gordon again
request permission...

889
01:23:55,018 --> 01:23:58,454
To secure until convoy arrives. Over.

890
01:23:58,655 --> 01:24:01,715
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

891
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:05,416
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

892
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:07,429
They know what they're asking.

893
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:09,098
Let me talk to them.

894
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:10,391
This is Garrison.

895
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:14,733
I want to make sure that you understand
what you're asking, so say it out loud.

896
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:20,799
We're asking to go in and set up a
perimeter until ground support arrives.

897
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:25,308
You realize that I cannot tell you when
that might be, it could take a while.

898
01:24:26,216 --> 01:24:28,742
Roger that.
You still want to go in there?

899
01:24:29,086 --> 01:24:29,882
Yes, sir.

900
01:24:33,891 --> 01:24:35,518
Colonel Harrell?
Yes, General?

901
01:24:35,593 --> 01:24:36,651
It's your call.

902
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:39,318
Roger that.

903
01:24:41,098 --> 01:24:43,293
Goffena, put them in.

904
01:24:57,215 --> 01:24:58,978
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

905
01:25:04,155 --> 01:25:05,144
RPG!

906
01:25:15,033 --> 01:25:16,625
Set up your perimeter!

907
01:25:24,076 --> 01:25:26,067
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

908
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:30,012
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

909
01:25:31,316 --> 01:25:33,147
Son of a bitch.

910
01:25:34,653 --> 01:25:37,816
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up! Easy, easy!

911
01:25:38,123 --> 01:25:41,217
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

912
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:43,951
Get in that truck and drive.

913
01:25:44,029 --> 01:25:46,089
But I'm shot, Colonel.
Everybody's shot.

914
01:25:46,165 --> 01:25:48,258
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

915
01:25:49,335 --> 01:25:52,827
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

916
01:25:53,072 --> 01:25:57,338
McKnight, we need you to turn
around and head back to Hawlwadig.

917
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,774
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

918
01:25:59,846 --> 01:26:01,609
There must be a better route!

919
01:26:01,681 --> 01:26:06,846
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

920
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,146
Roger that. Roger that.

921
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:13,490
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

922
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:15,527
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

923
01:26:15,595 --> 01:26:17,187
Just get it over with! Drive!

924
01:26:17,263 --> 01:26:18,252
Goddamn!

925
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:20,863
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

926
01:26:28,575 --> 01:26:30,008
Keep your foot on the gas!

927
01:26:30,077 --> 01:26:32,307
Keep your foot on the gas!

928
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:44,882
Fuck!

929
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:48,817
Shit.

930
01:27:04,278 --> 01:27:07,043
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

931
01:27:07,248 --> 01:27:08,215
Roger.

932
01:27:34,309 --> 01:27:35,867
Friendlies!

933
01:27:38,046 --> 01:27:39,274
God, it's good to see you!

934
01:27:39,347 --> 01:27:41,315
It's good to see you. How bad?

935
01:27:41,383 --> 01:27:44,284
My leg's broken and my
back feels kind of weird.

936
01:27:44,419 --> 01:27:46,513
We've got to get you out of here.

937
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:49,321
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

938
01:27:52,728 --> 01:27:53,717
Wait, I...

939
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:03,533
I'm putting you down.

940
01:28:03,773 --> 01:28:06,708
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

941
01:28:06,776 --> 01:28:08,368
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

942
01:28:08,444 --> 01:28:09,877
You're locked and loaded.

943
01:28:09,945 --> 01:28:13,676
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

944
01:28:13,749 --> 01:28:16,411
Where's the rescue squad?
We're it.

945
01:28:22,124 --> 01:28:25,219
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

946
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:27,696
Son of a bitch.

947
01:28:27,798 --> 01:28:30,665
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

948
01:28:30,901 --> 01:28:33,597
I'm low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

949
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,638
Vehicles that are barely running.

950
01:28:35,705 --> 01:28:38,640
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-BS assessment here.

951
01:28:39,075 --> 01:28:41,202
Can you get to the crash site?

952
01:28:41,945 --> 01:28:44,539
Colonel, I can't see shit.

953
01:28:48,618 --> 01:28:49,516
Negative.

954
01:28:49,586 --> 01:28:52,646
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

955
01:28:52,722 --> 01:28:56,681
We need to come back to base,
rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

956
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,749
Roger.

957
01:28:59,596 --> 01:29:02,861
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

958
01:29:04,335 --> 01:29:05,927
Roger. Return to base.

959
01:29:06,737 --> 01:29:08,102
We're going home!

960
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:10,297
Let's go. Left.

961
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:26,520
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

962
01:29:31,796 --> 01:29:33,889
What's up?
They're sending them back.

963
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:35,626
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

964
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,861
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

965
01:29:38,369 --> 01:29:42,396
We need to exfil the wounded now and
get out of here before it's too late!

966
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,302
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

967
01:29:46,478 --> 01:29:47,945
It changes nothing.

968
01:29:48,146 --> 01:29:49,545
All right, listen up.

969
01:29:49,615 --> 01:29:53,608
We're going to hold the perimeter and
we're going to hold the strongpoint.

970
01:29:54,386 --> 01:29:57,651
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

971
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,255
The convoy is going to come.

972
01:30:02,661 --> 01:30:03,650
We're going to get home.

973
01:30:16,141 --> 01:30:17,130
Loading!

974
01:30:25,618 --> 01:30:26,949
Loading!

975
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:29,284
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

976
01:30:42,669 --> 01:30:43,658
Loading!

977
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:48,806
Randy, last mag!

978
01:30:52,312 --> 01:30:53,336
Gordy!

979
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:58,072
Fuck!

980
01:31:11,565 --> 01:31:13,760
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

981
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:15,461
Good luck.

982
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:39,757
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

983
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,956
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

984
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:44,997
They don't know we've gone in.

985
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:49,503
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here.
We're fighting the entire city.

986
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:54,669
I want every vehicle possible that's
got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

987
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:58,175
Once they've assembled, we'll move
our men out of the hostile area...

988
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:00,840
And back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

989
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:03,440
Now, let's go.
Roger that.

990
01:34:40,312 --> 01:34:42,940
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

991
01:34:47,586 --> 01:34:51,522
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

992
01:34:56,061 --> 01:34:58,996
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

993
01:34:59,064 --> 01:35:02,592
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

994
01:35:02,802 --> 01:35:05,862
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

995
01:35:06,105 --> 01:35:08,198
Negative. You don't understand.

996
01:35:08,374 --> 01:35:12,902
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

997
01:35:13,546 --> 01:35:17,175
There ain't one. The only other
route is all the way around the city.

998
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,342
Roger that.

999
01:35:18,418 --> 01:35:20,909
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

1000
01:35:21,154 --> 01:35:25,614
Request permission to move to
crash site number two on foot. Over.

1001
01:35:26,526 --> 01:35:28,551
Green light, Kilo 11.

1002
01:35:28,628 --> 01:35:31,028
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1003
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:19,705
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1004
01:36:19,781 --> 01:36:22,648
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1005
01:36:29,858 --> 01:36:33,055
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

1006
01:36:46,841 --> 01:36:48,570
Eversmann, come in.

1007
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:49,902
Eversmann.

1008
01:36:52,347 --> 01:36:54,679
Roger, who is this?
Sanderson.

1009
01:36:54,749 --> 01:36:59,186
Do not... I say again, do not fire
to the east. We are coming to you.

1010
01:37:00,656 --> 01:37:01,782
Understood.

1011
01:37:02,058 --> 01:37:04,492
DiTomasso and his men are
on the southeast corner.

1012
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,926
We need you on the northeast building.

1013
01:37:06,996 --> 01:37:08,463
Roger. We'll take it.

1014
01:37:09,065 --> 01:37:11,295
Watch out for skinnies.
They're on the rooftops.

1015
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:13,858
They're in prayer but
not for much longer.

1016
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,137
Hold your fire to the east.

1017
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:42,926
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1018
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,700
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1019
01:37:46,103 --> 01:37:48,867
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

1020
01:37:49,106 --> 01:37:52,234
We're on the southwest corner.
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1021
01:37:52,309 --> 01:37:53,173
Yeah.

1022
01:37:54,745 --> 01:37:56,872
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1023
01:38:01,685 --> 01:38:02,743
We got to go.

1024
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:05,754
Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1025
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:09,881
When he gets across the street,
he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1026
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,090
Listen closely. When you get there,
you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1027
01:38:15,732 --> 01:38:18,064
You won't just run to
Eversmann's position.

1028
01:38:18,135 --> 01:38:20,969
You're going to stop and
you are going to cover me.

1029
01:38:21,472 --> 01:38:23,633
It's important you understand that.

1030
01:38:24,108 --> 01:38:25,473
Okay, you ready?

1031
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:27,642
Yeah, I guess.

1032
01:38:33,217 --> 01:38:34,775
Don't forget.
What?

1033
01:38:35,453 --> 01:38:36,681
Don't forget.

1034
01:38:50,201 --> 01:38:53,568
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

1035
01:38:53,638 --> 01:38:54,764
I see them.

1036
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,006
Let's move out.

1037
01:39:01,447 --> 01:39:03,176
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1038
01:39:03,415 --> 01:39:04,746
We got you.

1039
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:13,389
Nelson!

1040
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:21,188
Fuck!

1041
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:30,697
Twombly!

1042
01:39:32,511 --> 01:39:33,637
Smith! No!

1043
01:39:33,779 --> 01:39:35,041
You all right?

1044
01:39:38,384 --> 01:39:39,749
Get it off of me!

1045
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:41,919
Get it off!

1046
01:39:43,223 --> 01:39:44,850
Come on, man. Come on.

1047
01:39:46,025 --> 01:39:48,960
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1048
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:58,667
My leg! My leg!

1049
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:00,433
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1050
01:40:07,514 --> 01:40:09,539
Up, one, two, three.

1051
01:40:10,884 --> 01:40:13,546
You're all right.
I need some pressure on this wound.

1052
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,678
My right thigh!

1053
01:40:14,754 --> 01:40:16,449
Pressure, yeah.

1054
01:40:16,623 --> 01:40:18,956
Are my balls okay?
You still have your balls.

1055
01:40:19,026 --> 01:40:20,118
I need more men in here.

1056
01:40:20,194 --> 01:40:22,788
Twombly! Nelson!

1057
01:40:22,863 --> 01:40:25,923
Put him down.
Oh, man, that really...

1058
01:40:27,268 --> 01:40:29,498
It really hurts!
Direct pressure on that.

1059
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:31,060
It's okay, it's okay.

1060
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:34,005
Let me see it!
All right.

1061
01:40:34,475 --> 01:40:36,739
All right, let me get a look at that.

1062
01:40:37,144 --> 01:40:38,543
Oh, shit!

1063
01:40:38,746 --> 01:40:39,974
Oh, fuck!

1064
01:40:40,181 --> 01:40:42,581
What the fuck was that?
It's all right.

1065
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:44,811
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1066
01:40:44,885 --> 01:40:46,284
Fuck. Galentine!

1067
01:40:46,487 --> 01:40:47,476
It's all right.

1068
01:40:47,555 --> 01:40:49,352
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1069
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:53,317
Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1070
01:40:53,394 --> 01:40:57,263
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

1071
01:40:57,365 --> 01:41:00,425
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus.

1072
01:41:00,502 --> 01:41:02,902
Can you do that?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1073
01:41:02,971 --> 01:41:04,871
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1074
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,229
Yes, sir.

1075
01:41:06,474 --> 01:41:10,467
Anybody comes through that door gets
two in the chest and one in the head.

1076
01:41:10,812 --> 01:41:14,248
You understand?
I'm still in the fight, sir.

1077
01:41:14,516 --> 01:41:17,451
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

1078
01:41:17,652 --> 01:41:20,143
Corporal Smith has been hit!
Hold on, 25.

1079
01:41:20,488 --> 01:41:21,921
Still in the fight.

1080
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:23,457
He's hurt pretty bad.

1081
01:41:23,525 --> 01:41:27,256
25, we got wounded too. You'll have
to maintain your situation, over.

1082
01:41:27,329 --> 01:41:29,889
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

1083
01:41:30,665 --> 01:41:32,758
C-2, this is 64.

1084
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:37,201
Requesting a medivac for a critically
wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1085
01:41:37,273 --> 01:41:40,140
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

1086
01:41:40,343 --> 01:41:42,675
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1087
01:41:43,145 --> 01:41:48,014
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1088
01:41:48,351 --> 01:41:52,185
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

1089
01:41:52,388 --> 01:41:56,154
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You'll just have to hold on.

1090
01:42:02,732 --> 01:42:04,165
All right. I got him.

1091
01:42:04,233 --> 01:42:06,667
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1092
01:42:08,537 --> 01:42:10,334
It's going to be all right.

1093
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:52,280
I think this is mine!

1094
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:58,047
This is Kilo 11.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

1095
01:42:58,256 --> 01:42:59,655
Roger that.

1096
01:43:21,245 --> 01:43:23,008
Crash site two secured.

1097
01:43:23,247 --> 01:43:25,613
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1098
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:26,981
Cribbs?

1099
01:43:28,986 --> 01:43:31,284
They're still debating the route.
How long?

1100
01:43:31,422 --> 01:43:33,049
At least a couple of hours.

1101
01:43:33,224 --> 01:43:34,885
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1102
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:39,556
Pakistani General says, since we didn't
deign to inform him of the raid...

1103
01:43:39,765 --> 01:43:43,599
It'll take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1104
01:43:43,669 --> 01:43:45,660
You tell the general this:

1105
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:48,772
I understand, but it is
my duty to remind him...

1106
01:43:48,974 --> 01:43:53,035
That my men are surrounded by
thousands of armed Somali militia.

1107
01:43:53,245 --> 01:43:58,512
It's imperative that we move them out of
the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1108
01:43:58,717 --> 01:44:00,241
I need his help now.

1109
01:44:01,253 --> 01:44:02,481
Yes, sir.

1110
01:44:07,593 --> 01:44:08,821
Durant.

1111
01:44:09,528 --> 01:44:11,996
Michael Durant.

1112
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:13,720
Yes.

1113
01:44:14,199 --> 01:44:16,600
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1114
01:44:16,803 --> 01:44:20,204
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1115
01:44:24,144 --> 01:44:25,441
That's right.

1116
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:29,104
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1117
01:44:32,318 --> 01:44:36,948
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1118
01:44:38,825 --> 01:44:40,690
What do you want with me?

1119
01:44:41,528 --> 01:44:43,257
You have taken hostages.

1120
01:44:44,264 --> 01:44:45,856
We have you.

1121
01:44:46,065 --> 01:44:49,159
My government will
never negotiate for me.

1122
01:44:49,702 --> 01:44:54,264
Then perhaps you and
I can negotiate, huh?

1123
01:44:55,743 --> 01:44:58,268
Soldier to soldier.

1124
01:45:04,218 --> 01:45:06,015
I'm not in charge.

1125
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:13,727
Course not. You have the power to kill,
but not negotiate.

1126
01:45:14,195 --> 01:45:17,096
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1127
01:45:18,666 --> 01:45:22,033
Do you really think if
you get General Aidid...

1128
01:45:22,236 --> 01:45:25,603
We will simply put down our weapons...

1129
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:28,731
And adopt American democracy?

1130
01:45:29,176 --> 01:45:30,973
That the killing will stop?

1131
01:45:31,378 --> 01:45:35,440
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

1132
01:45:36,218 --> 01:45:38,652
There will always be killing, you see?

1133
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:41,315
This is how things are in our world.

1134
01:45:54,169 --> 01:45:57,832
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1135
01:45:59,975 --> 01:46:03,411
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1136
01:46:06,147 --> 01:46:09,014
You got to take over from me.
Both hands.

1137
01:46:16,726 --> 01:46:19,957
It's the femoral artery,
but I can't see it.

1138
01:46:20,162 --> 01:46:23,620
Which means that it's
retracted up into the pelvis.

1139
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:28,133
I have to find it and clamp it.
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1140
01:46:28,337 --> 01:46:30,430
I got no more IVs.

1141
01:46:31,707 --> 01:46:34,608
So, I'm going to need
you to assist. Okay?

1142
01:46:34,744 --> 01:46:36,371
Yeah, yeah.

1143
01:46:37,313 --> 01:46:40,680
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1144
01:46:41,951 --> 01:46:45,648
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

1145
01:46:45,855 --> 01:46:47,379
All right, you understand?

1146
01:46:47,456 --> 01:46:49,447
Morphine.
I can't.

1147
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:52,253
It'll lower your heart rate too far.
I'm sorry.

1148
01:46:52,328 --> 01:46:54,627
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1149
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:02,071
Hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1150
01:47:02,139 --> 01:47:04,334
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1151
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:05,867
On my count.

1152
01:47:05,943 --> 01:47:07,934
All right, Jamie. All right.

1153
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:12,374
One. Two.

1154
01:47:13,317 --> 01:47:14,375
Three.

1155
01:47:22,092 --> 01:47:24,526
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1156
01:47:25,162 --> 01:47:26,527
I feel the pulse.

1157
01:47:28,098 --> 01:47:29,429
I got it. I got it.

1158
01:47:29,499 --> 01:47:31,091
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1159
01:47:31,168 --> 01:47:32,760
I got it.
You got it?

1160
01:47:33,204 --> 01:47:34,193
Clamp?

1161
01:47:36,608 --> 01:47:37,973
I got it clamped.

1162
01:47:38,109 --> 01:47:39,303
Hold it.
Got it.

1163
01:47:39,377 --> 01:47:40,639
Here, grab it.

1164
01:47:41,312 --> 01:47:43,041
It's tearing.
I got it.

1165
01:47:43,281 --> 01:47:45,146
Doc, it's going back in!
Hold it!

1166
01:47:45,216 --> 01:47:46,444
It's tearing!

1167
01:47:46,784 --> 01:47:49,753
Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
Okay, I'm holding.

1168
01:47:50,989 --> 01:47:52,286
Move your hand.

1169
01:48:03,501 --> 01:48:04,729
What?

1170
01:48:23,856 --> 01:48:24,845
Fix it?

1171
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,894
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1172
01:48:46,545 --> 01:48:48,342
What the hell are you doing?

1173
01:48:48,414 --> 01:48:52,818
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1174
01:48:53,019 --> 01:48:55,681
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1175
01:49:12,005 --> 01:49:15,964
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1176
01:49:17,777 --> 01:49:19,369
Gold Coast blend.

1177
01:49:19,579 --> 01:49:22,514
Sit down.
I want to take a look at that foot.

1178
01:49:23,116 --> 01:49:25,209
No, it's not a problem.
Come on.

1179
01:49:31,658 --> 01:49:34,753
Where the hell did they find you?
Behind a desk.

1180
01:49:36,263 --> 01:49:39,289
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1181
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:44,767
Is anybody hit?
We're good!

1182
01:49:50,144 --> 01:49:51,304
You all right?

1183
01:49:51,378 --> 01:49:52,367
Yeah!

1184
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:54,047
Is everybody all right?

1185
01:49:54,115 --> 01:49:55,139
Yeah!

1186
01:50:09,163 --> 01:50:10,357
Incoming!

1187
01:50:23,545 --> 01:50:25,479
Keep firing... Faster!

1188
01:51:15,932 --> 01:51:17,923
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1189
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:53,130
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1190
01:51:53,203 --> 01:51:56,434
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast
corner of the crash. Who's this?

1191
01:51:56,506 --> 01:51:58,497
This is Hoot.
I'm coming with three friendlies.

1192
01:51:58,575 --> 01:52:00,236
I need cover fire. Over.

1193
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:03,245
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

1194
01:52:03,313 --> 01:52:05,338
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1195
01:52:10,053 --> 01:52:14,684
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

1196
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,126
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

1197
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:21,494
If we don't hold back this city...

1198
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:25,192
We'll have a 100 caskets
to fill by morning.

1199
01:52:25,403 --> 01:52:26,631
Yes, sir.

1200
01:52:26,838 --> 01:52:29,602
Colonel Harrell, ground
personnel at crash site one...

1201
01:52:29,674 --> 01:52:34,168
Will have to mark the target with
infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1202
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:40,678
McKnight.

1203
01:52:44,756 --> 01:52:48,351
Between the 10th Mountain and UN,
we got enough personnel, okay?

1204
01:52:49,694 --> 01:52:52,493
Danny, you guys do not
have to go back out again.

1205
01:53:12,651 --> 01:53:15,211
I can't die here, man.

1206
01:53:16,388 --> 01:53:20,484
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

1207
01:53:21,393 --> 01:53:22,860
I'm sorry.

1208
01:53:23,062 --> 01:53:26,327
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1209
01:53:26,498 --> 01:53:29,662
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1210
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,337
You okay, Twombs?

1211
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:34,737
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1212
01:53:36,076 --> 01:53:38,271
You did what you were trained to do.

1213
01:53:39,212 --> 01:53:41,077
You should be proud of that.

1214
01:53:44,184 --> 01:53:45,515
Be proud of that.

1215
01:53:46,353 --> 01:53:48,218
Ev?
Yeah.

1216
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:51,521
Do me a favor.

1217
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:59,531
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

1218
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:08,838
And that I fought hard.

1219
01:54:10,811 --> 01:54:13,279
You're going to tell
them yourself, okay?

1220
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:14,678
Do you hear me?

1221
01:54:16,484 --> 01:54:17,542
All right?

1222
01:54:19,687 --> 01:54:22,815
Are the humvees here?
They're coming, Jamie.

1223
01:54:23,324 --> 01:54:25,155
They're coming.

1224
01:54:25,326 --> 01:54:27,590
You just got to hang
in there a little bit.

1225
01:54:27,661 --> 01:54:30,152
You hold on for just a little bit.
I can.

1226
01:54:30,331 --> 01:54:31,491
I can.

1227
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:34,334
It's nothing.

1228
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:37,002
It's nothing.

1229
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:39,165
It's nothing.

1230
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:41,572
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

1231
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:43,670
Nothing.

1232
01:54:51,353 --> 01:54:52,342
Oh, shit.

1233
01:54:53,355 --> 01:54:54,686
Hold the wound.

1234
01:55:21,716 --> 01:55:23,013
Doc.

1235
01:55:25,887 --> 01:55:26,911
Doc.

1236
01:55:44,006 --> 01:55:45,337
It's okay.

1237
01:56:11,969 --> 01:56:13,436
What are you doing?

1238
01:56:16,807 --> 01:56:18,536
We need the ammo.

1239
01:56:26,817 --> 01:56:28,614
You did all you could here.

1240
01:56:29,153 --> 01:56:31,383
They should've sent a medivac.

1241
01:56:31,889 --> 01:56:35,552
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

1242
01:56:35,826 --> 01:56:38,317
More men would get torn up.

1243
01:56:41,331 --> 01:56:42,662
Maybe.

1244
01:56:43,167 --> 01:56:46,034
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1245
01:56:46,136 --> 01:56:49,163
Because, Sergeant, you can't
control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1246
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:52,004
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1247
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:54,838
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1248
01:56:56,848 --> 01:56:58,839
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1249
01:57:00,518 --> 01:57:05,114
This all happened because Blackburn fell.
Should have, could have, don't matter.

1250
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:09,056
You'll get plenty of time to think
about all that later. Believe me.

1251
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:15,958
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1252
01:57:16,801 --> 01:57:18,496
You did it right today.

1253
01:57:18,703 --> 01:57:22,161
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

1254
01:57:28,581 --> 01:57:30,481
Well, shall we?

1255
01:57:39,225 --> 01:57:42,319
I need four guys in this corner now!

1256
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:50,092
RPG!

1257
01:57:54,006 --> 01:57:56,497
This is Barber 52 in
position for gun run.

1258
01:57:56,575 --> 01:57:58,702
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1259
01:57:59,411 --> 01:58:02,437
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

1260
01:58:02,615 --> 01:58:06,051
Eversmann, I can't tell who's
who down there. Too much activity.

1261
01:58:06,118 --> 01:58:08,610
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1262
01:58:08,855 --> 01:58:10,015
Roger that.

1263
01:58:21,801 --> 01:58:22,961
You see it?

1264
01:58:25,305 --> 01:58:26,897
Nah, I can't see shit.

1265
01:58:27,874 --> 01:58:30,741
I'm putting it on the roof.
You're going to need help!

1266
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:31,799
Cover me.

1267
01:58:33,013 --> 01:58:36,779
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

1268
01:58:36,983 --> 01:58:37,972
Ready?

1269
01:58:38,151 --> 01:58:39,140
One.

1270
01:58:39,219 --> 01:58:40,311
Two.

1271
01:58:40,487 --> 01:58:42,216
Three. Go!

1272
01:59:14,789 --> 01:59:18,225
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

1273
01:59:42,818 --> 01:59:47,482
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1274
01:59:47,656 --> 01:59:50,489
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

1275
01:59:50,659 --> 01:59:52,854
On your location, four minutes.

1276
02:00:01,002 --> 02:00:04,062
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

1277
02:00:04,539 --> 02:00:06,974
Lay down some cover fire!

1278
02:00:09,312 --> 02:00:11,405
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1279
02:00:11,481 --> 02:00:14,211
Load up. We're getting out of here.
Yes, sir.

1280
02:00:17,387 --> 02:00:22,120
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here
and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1281
02:00:22,325 --> 02:00:24,054
Prepare your men for exfil.

1282
02:00:24,127 --> 02:00:26,618
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1283
02:00:27,363 --> 02:00:31,129
Five minutes! The convoy is
going to be here in five minutes!

1284
02:00:51,088 --> 02:00:53,352
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1285
02:00:53,524 --> 02:00:54,855
My last one!

1286
02:01:05,035 --> 02:01:07,196
The convoy is here!

1287
02:01:25,757 --> 02:01:29,284
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

1288
02:01:29,527 --> 02:01:31,188
Yes, sir!

1289
02:01:31,396 --> 02:01:33,990
Bring your wounded and
start loading them up!

1290
02:01:41,206 --> 02:01:43,333
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1291
02:01:43,541 --> 02:01:46,271
It's okay. I want to walk.

1292
02:01:46,811 --> 02:01:49,871
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1293
02:01:59,057 --> 02:02:00,149
Move!

1294
02:02:03,428 --> 02:02:06,762
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

1295
02:02:07,433 --> 02:02:09,230
We're running out of room around here.

1296
02:02:09,301 --> 02:02:11,269
Cram into every possible space.

1297
02:02:12,104 --> 02:02:17,098
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1298
02:02:17,309 --> 02:02:18,799
10th Mountain? No.

1299
02:02:19,011 --> 02:02:22,105
Sir, with respect, my Rangers
can provide rear security.

1300
02:02:22,281 --> 02:02:26,445
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1301
02:02:27,453 --> 02:02:28,715
Okay, let's get out of here.

1302
02:02:28,787 --> 02:02:29,981
Let's go.

1303
02:02:30,189 --> 02:02:32,680
All right, you got him?
Yeah, come on.

1304
02:02:34,627 --> 02:02:35,992
Come on!

1305
02:02:37,129 --> 02:02:40,121
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

1306
02:02:40,199 --> 02:02:42,633
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1307
02:02:45,505 --> 02:02:46,699
Careful.

1308
02:02:47,307 --> 02:02:49,502
Easy. Go easy.

1309
02:02:52,913 --> 02:02:54,278
Easy.

1310
02:03:04,791 --> 02:03:07,021
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1311
02:03:07,093 --> 02:03:10,290
They're dismantling the
entire cockpit around the body.

1312
02:03:10,497 --> 02:03:14,160
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1313
02:03:15,101 --> 02:03:16,466
They can't say!

1314
02:03:18,438 --> 02:03:19,666
Danny...

1315
02:03:21,174 --> 02:03:22,971
No one gets left behind.

1316
02:03:23,677 --> 02:03:25,509
You understand me, son?

1317
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:27,447
Yes, General.

1318
02:03:28,115 --> 02:03:29,742
Do what you have to do.

1319
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:32,380
Roger.

1320
02:03:39,026 --> 02:03:41,256
Come on. Bring him through.
I got him.

1321
02:03:42,129 --> 02:03:45,292
Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.
Got you, sir!

1322
02:03:50,905 --> 02:03:52,304
Move!
Got you!

1323
02:03:52,974 --> 02:03:54,999
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1324
02:04:05,087 --> 02:04:06,076
Fuck!

1325
02:04:08,924 --> 02:04:10,255
Fire in the hole!

1326
02:04:10,459 --> 02:04:12,290
Let's go! Move!
Let's go!

1327
02:04:22,838 --> 02:04:26,239
Open the hatch! We got men back here!
No room here! Go on the roof!

1328
02:04:26,308 --> 02:04:27,400
What's going on?

1329
02:04:27,476 --> 02:04:30,468
The roof?
I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1330
02:04:31,446 --> 02:04:32,845
No, no, it's full.

1331
02:04:34,282 --> 02:04:37,547
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

1332
02:04:39,955 --> 02:04:42,014
Move it! Let's go!

1333
02:04:58,941 --> 02:05:01,466
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1334
02:05:03,479 --> 02:05:04,844
Move!
Go! Move!

1335
02:05:05,081 --> 02:05:06,446
Go!

1336
02:06:01,038 --> 02:06:03,473
Get down! Get down!

1337
02:06:04,709 --> 02:06:05,971
Get down, lady!

1338
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:09,845
I'm out of ammo!

1339
02:06:11,216 --> 02:06:13,207
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1340
02:06:18,223 --> 02:06:19,815
Don't you do it.

1341
02:06:20,425 --> 02:06:22,916
What are you doing?
Don't you damn do it.

1342
02:06:24,729 --> 02:06:26,094
Kurth, let's go!

1343
02:08:49,945 --> 02:08:51,435
Easy.

1344
02:09:41,331 --> 02:09:43,094
Ah, shit.

1345
02:09:43,166 --> 02:09:46,829
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

1346
02:09:48,504 --> 02:09:50,529
Hurry up, hurry up.

1347
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:57,903
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

1348
02:10:02,186 --> 02:10:03,813
How you doing, soldier?

1349
02:10:05,022 --> 02:10:06,887
Can't feel a thing.

1350
02:10:16,967 --> 02:10:18,559
Take his pulse.

1351
02:10:51,903 --> 02:10:53,302
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1352
02:10:57,876 --> 02:10:58,865
Captain.

1353
02:10:59,044 --> 02:11:02,036
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1354
02:11:04,649 --> 02:11:09,484
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

1355
02:11:09,654 --> 02:11:11,349
That's great news.

1356
02:11:11,956 --> 02:11:13,651
Are we going after them?

1357
02:11:13,758 --> 02:11:16,488
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

1358
02:11:18,063 --> 02:11:19,998
Don't go out there without me.

1359
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,492
Don't go back out there without me.

1360
02:11:25,237 --> 02:11:27,137
I can still do my job.

1361
02:11:28,908 --> 02:11:31,536
You get some rest now, okay?

1362
02:11:46,692 --> 02:11:48,091
You're going back in?

1363
02:11:50,196 --> 02:11:52,027
There are still men out there.

1364
02:11:54,433 --> 02:11:55,991
Goddamn.

1365
02:12:01,174 --> 02:12:02,471
When I go home...

1366
02:12:03,477 --> 02:12:04,967
And people ask me:

1367
02:12:05,145 --> 02:12:08,478
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1368
02:12:09,049 --> 02:12:12,883
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1369
02:12:13,687 --> 02:12:16,121
I won't say a goddamn word.

1370
02:12:16,456 --> 02:12:17,684
Why?

1371
02:12:18,325 --> 02:12:20,156
They won't understand.

1372
02:12:21,895 --> 02:12:24,193
They won't understand why we do it.

1373
02:12:25,699 --> 02:12:29,829
They won't understand it's
about the men next to you.

1374
02:12:31,671 --> 02:12:33,002
And that's it.

1375
02:12:35,175 --> 02:12:36,506
That's all it is.

1376
02:12:46,854 --> 02:12:51,223
Don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

1377
02:12:56,364 --> 02:12:59,356
We started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

1378
02:13:12,213 --> 02:13:14,374
I was talking to
Blackburn the other day...

1379
02:13:14,448 --> 02:13:19,148
And he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?"

1380
02:13:20,689 --> 02:13:23,021
And I said, "Nothing."

1381
02:13:23,225 --> 02:13:27,161
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

1382
02:13:28,564 --> 02:13:30,054
I know I've changed.

1383
02:13:35,837 --> 02:13:38,533
A friend of mine asked
me before I got here...

1384
02:13:38,674 --> 02:13:40,938
It was when we were all shipping out.

1385
02:13:41,076 --> 02:13:42,566
He asked me:

1386
02:13:43,845 --> 02:13:46,575
"Why are you going to
fight somebody else's war?

1387
02:13:47,282 --> 02:13:49,716
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1388
02:13:52,688 --> 02:13:55,088
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1389
02:13:58,027 --> 02:14:00,427
But if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1390
02:14:02,999 --> 02:14:05,024
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1391
02:14:06,135 --> 02:14:08,160
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1392
02:14:13,509 --> 02:14:15,773
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1393
02:14:19,749 --> 02:14:22,809
I'll talk to your ma and
pa when I get home, okay?

1394
02:15:06,397 --> 02:15:10,094
My love, you are strong and
you will do well in life.

1395
02:15:11,135 --> 02:15:13,603
I love you and my children deeply.

1396
02:15:14,505 --> 02:15:17,998
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

1397
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:23,374
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

1398
02:15:24,683 --> 02:15:27,117
So, in closing, my love...

1399
02:15:27,485 --> 02:15:31,319
Tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1400
02:15:31,756 --> 02:15:36,352
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

1401
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:39,394
And give them both a
kiss good night for Daddy.
