00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,662
Hey, 'morning, Rob.

2
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:06,399
Hey.

3
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:15,742
Good morning, Alan.

4
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:19,245
Hey! Whoa!

5
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,838
( Knocking on door )
Woman: Robbie, honey,

6
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,173
you've got to leave for school
in 20 minutes.

7
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,441
Are you dressed yet?

8
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,442
Yeah, mom.

9
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,912
How does your tie look?

10
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,150
Fine, mom.

11
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,524
Testing, testing, 1-2-3.

12
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,193
This is just a test.

13
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:12,198
( Beep )
( Mechanism whirrs )

14
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,900
Testing, testing, 1-2-3.

15
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:21,207
( Voice deepens )
This is just a test.

16
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,376
( Telephone dialing )
( Telephone ringing )

17
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,718
Hello?

18
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,219
Hello, is...

19
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,288
( Deepened voice )
James brandenburg there, please?

20
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,289
Speaking.

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,957
James.

22
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,560
This is detective sergeant
Nelson from the Kansas City

23
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,295
police department.

24
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,963
Vice squad.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,198
Huh?

26
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,700
Well, it has been reported
that on the night of August

27
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,304
the 26th, you were in violation
of section 5672

28
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,640
of the penal code,
which clearly states

29
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,276
that, as a minor,
you're not allowed to perform

30
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,278
the disgusting deeds
you are alleged to have

31
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,814
committed with that chicken.

32
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,284
( Click, beep )
( Normal voice )

33
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,251
James, you there?

34
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,252
Nice voice, Rob.

35
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,587
How'd you do it?

36
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,722
Voice synthesizer.

37
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,723
I just got it.

38
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,724
Shut up!

39
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,793
Man, I wish my parents
could win the lottery.

40
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:14,727
You wanna trade?

41
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,397
Sure. I could get used
to being rich.

42
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,567
Cool. I'll fly back
to Kansas City and hang,

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,436
and you can come out here
and go to a snob school

44
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,505
while your parents
jet out to Brussels.

45
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,507
What are they doing,
buying sprout?

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,809
It's a horse auction, retard.

47
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,478
Honey, hurry up!

48
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,846
And who are you talking to?

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,316
And I thought you said
your tie was tied.

50
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,885
No, I didn't, and i'm
talking to Jimmy, so...

51
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,954
Hello, Jimmy, Robin will
call you as soon as he gets

52
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,523
home from school.

53
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,524
Mom!

54
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,492
Oh, baby!

55
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,363
I'm sorry I can't take you
to school on your first day.

56
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,164
A new school.

57
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,366
( Chuckles )
But in order to get

58
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,735
the concorde, we had to take
this early flight.

59
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,737
You gonna pick me up
one of those French bows

60
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,671
I was talking about?

61
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,940
Don't you think you have
enough bows?

62
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,976
Don't you think you have
enough horses?

63
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,045
Hey, Rob, good knot.

64
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,081
Feels like I'm gonna choke.

65
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:13,753
Well... I think
you look very... handsome.

66
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,922
Oh, Robbie, this is a wonderful
opportunity for you,

67
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,657
going to this school.

68
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,859
Locksley academy is
the best.

69
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:20,827
Come on, hon, we gotta go.

70
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,996
Uh, honey, are you
gonna wear that hat?

71
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,530
Are you gonna wear that hat?

72
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,933
Oh. Bye-bye, Robin.

73
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,934
Bye-bye!

74
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,403
Oh, we love you!

75
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,537
Call you when we get there.

76
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,406
Rosie: You two have
a nice flight.

77
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:43,483
Come on, Janet,
get in the car. 'Bye, Rosie.

78
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:56,095
Come on, Janet,
get in the car. 'Bye, Rosie.

79
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,831
Whoa! Easy, scout!

80
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,099
Hey!

81
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,934
Sorry!

82
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,403
Let me guess.

83
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,737
You're Robin?

84
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,005
Yeah. Who are you?

85
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,441
Marian. My dad's
the wrangler here.

86
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,476
He told me you finally
showed up.

87
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,477
How was computer camp?

88
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,812
( Muttering ) I dunno.

89
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,681
You like to ride?

90
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,716
I don't know. Never tried it.

91
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,750
You like archery?

92
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,018
Not when I'm the target.

93
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,087
Well, I wasn't
aiming for you, I was aiming

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,388
for the whirligig things.

95
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,856
Right.

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,857
Rosie: Robin!

97
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,528
Time for school!

98
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,531
Um, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll see you later?

99
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,466
Not if I see you first.

100
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,935
Hey! My arrow!

101
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,590
"Give us a boy,
and we will give you

102
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,025
back a man."

103
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,994
Gimme a break, or I'll
give you back the uniform.

104
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
So they take themselves
a little seriously.

105
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,765
It's a good school, Robin.

106
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,767
Yeah, well, so is
my school back home.

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,469
At least I had friends there.

108
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,537
Well, Seattle is your home
now, honey.

109
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,440
I know, Rosie,
but look at this place.

110
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,808
I mean, this isn't me.

111
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,811
No! You are you.

112
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,448
You're the same Robin McAllister
that you were back in Kansas.

113
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,483
So?

114
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,185
Just be yourself,
and then it doesn't matter

115
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,155
where you are.

116
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,156
Thanks, Rosie.

117
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,059
Have a good day.

118
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,731
Way to go, kid.

119
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,732
Sorry.

120
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,534
What'd you do, run to school?

121
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,468
I had to.

122
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,171
Papa's car broke down
and I didn't know

123
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,974
which bus to take.

124
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,208
This is my first day.

125
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,777
Mine to. Rob McAllister.

126
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,778
Tommy Tyler.

127
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,578
How you doin'?

128
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,781
Are you here
on a scholarship?

129
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,715
Well, not exactly.

130
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:10,229
Well, I am. That's why
I can't be late.

131
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,598
Man on P.A.:
All new students
should report to their

132
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,699
home rooms.

133
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,636
Room assignments are posted
on the...

134
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,839
( Continues indistinctly )
Cut it out!

135
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,946
Not until you pay
the tax, fat boy.

136
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:27,847
What tax?

137
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,118
Ugly tax.

138
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,054
The uglier you are,
the more you gotta pay.

139
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,123
Your daddy better give you
a big allowance,

140
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,059
'cause you're beyond ugly,
fat boy!

141
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:44,130
( Groaning )
How you doing?

142
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,097
What's going on?

143
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,035
( Chuckles ) Let me guess--
you're new.

144
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,903
...fat boy!

145
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,904
Shouldn't we--?

146
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,905
Never fear.

147
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,041
Will Scarlet's here.

148
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,611
Unh!

149
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,813
( Groaning ) Yuck!

150
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,615
Warner! Gibson! Sic!

151
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,182
Ha ha ha!

152
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,183
Oww!

153
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,286
This would be an excellent
time to leave!

154
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,922
Let's get 'em!

155
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,992
Get out of the way!

156
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,167
Gentlemen, if you please...!

157
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,639
Mr. Little!

158
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,608
What is going on here?

159
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,609
Speak?

160
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,044
Good morning,
Mr. Harvey, sir.

161
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,113
These three young gentlemen
just attacked us out of

162
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,114
nowhere, sir.

163
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,048
What?

164
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,117
We don't even know why,
Mr. Harvey, sir.

165
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,753
Silence. Young man...

166
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,657
I want you, you, and you
to wait for me in my office.

167
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,658
What for?

168
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,794
Now! Now!

169
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:49,629
Off to your classes.

170
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,797
Have a wonderful day,
Mr. Harvey.

171
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,935
If it's not too much trouble.

172
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,804
So, what's your name, anyway?

173
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,072
Robin McAllister.

174
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,808
Will Scarlet.

175
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,810
My friend here,
who they were using

176
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,946
as a wrestling mat,
is John little, but everybody

177
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,014
calls him little John.

178
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,216
Yeah, well, they might
as well call me dead.

179
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,685
My mother's gonna kill me
when she finds out about this.

180
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,320
That's not fair.

181
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,689
Those other three were the ones
trying to take your money.

182
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,891
He's new.

183
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,893
Those three dirt bags
just happen to be

184
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,395
the richest kids in school.

185
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,397
I thought everyone here
was rich.

186
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,399
Well, there are a few
scholarship kids,

187
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,402
then there's rich,
then there's
filthy
rich.

188
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,404
That guy that was using
little John's stomach

189
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,405
as a trampoline...

190
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,739
Man, don't remind me.

191
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,874
...that's John prince.

192
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,411
His old man-- John, sr.--
Is paying for the new gym.

193
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,113
Yeah. The prince gymnasium.

194
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,115
You think Mr. Harvey's
gonna blow that off

195
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,717
by coming down on his son?

196
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,719
The same with those
other two guys,

197
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,987
Warner and Gibson.

198
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,122
Their dads sprung for
the new science wing.

199
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,124
Man, they can do
whatever they want.

200
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,726
It's not fair.

201
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,361
Of course, Mr. Prince.

202
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,129
And you tell the basketball
coach that if he wants

203
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,864
a bigger office, he can
build his own gym.

204
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,399
I'm sinking enough money
into this place as it is.

205
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,134
Yes, sir, Mr. Prince,
and we certainly appreciate

206
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,002
your generosity.

207
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:03,970
You should.

208
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,004
Thanks for stopping by.

209
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,006
Prince here. What?

211
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,007
Always a...

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,008
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,276
...a pleasure.

214
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,414
So... who's first?

215
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,860
Look out!

216
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,362
( Indistinct shouts )
Hey, are you all right?

217
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,944
I was until you came along.

218
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,079
Sorry.

219
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,213
I didn't see you.

220
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,348
Come on.

221
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,883
Where's scout? I mean...

222
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,451
Sir Richard of the lion heart.

223
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,786
Who?

224
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:27,720
The horse.

225
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,922
His name is scout,
but your mother decided

226
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,092
to change it to sir Richard
of the lion heart.

227
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,194
Yeah, well maybe it wasn't
an awesome enough name.

228
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,430
Great. Now he's probably
gone running back to his stable,

229
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,432
and my dad's got a buyer
coming to look at him.

230
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,501
Well, get on,
I'll give you a ride.

231
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,503
You expect me to ride
with you?

232
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,338
Well, why not?

233
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,242
Well, every time I've seen
you, I've almost been killed.

234
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,446
Okay. Suit yourself.

235
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,117
Robin.

236
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,118
Yeah?

237
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,486
Can I have a ride?

238
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,888
Okay, but you're gonna
have to say please.

239
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,424
Don't push your luck, Robin.

240
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,397
All right, hang on.

241
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,867
( Marion laughing )
Beauty, isn't he?

242
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,279
The boss is away in Europe,
buying some new stock.

243
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,281
That's the only reason
they're even thinking

244
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,017
of selling him.

245
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,018
Look him over.

246
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,554
I'll be right back.

247
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,556
Thought I told you
to loosen him up,

248
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,557
not turn him loose.

249
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,592
I had an... an accident.

250
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,227
It was my fault.

251
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,294
No, it was both our faults.

252
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,130
Are you all right?

253
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,432
Well, you both need
to be more careful.

254
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,934
These horses are
your parent's business now,

255
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,338
and it's my business
to look after them.

256
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,339
Understood?

257
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:57,042
Yes, dad.

258
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,078
My son would like to take
him for a test ride.

259
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,080
Oh, he's a spirited
animal, sir.

260
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,916
Oh, I'm sure John, Jr.,
can handle him, can't you, son?

261
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,384
What are
you
doing here?

262
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:11,290
My parents
own
this ranch,
and scout here is not for sale.

263
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,424
Scout?

264
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,426
I thought his name was
sir Richard of the lion heart.

265
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,294
It is.

266
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,496
Go ahead. Mount him up
if you'd like.

267
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,497
Yeah, hurry up, son.

268
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,199
I've got a plane to catch.

269
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,602
Uh... that's all right.

270
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,205
What? You don't
want the horse?

271
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,108
No, I just don't feel
like riding right now.

272
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
( Chuckles ) What a geek!

273
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,877
You're telling me.

274
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,879
How much did you say they
were asking for this horse?

275
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,881
$20,000, and worth
every penny.

276
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,017
What? Because they gave him
some fancy name?

277
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,218
I'll offer you 10,000.

278
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,055
Sorry, but you'll have
to talk to the boss about that.

279
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,224
Well, looks like you're
wasting my time. You tell them

280
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,326
when they're serious about
selling, they can contact me

281
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,328
at the prince American
corporation in Chicago.

282
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,263
Come on, son.

283
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,378
( Whinnies )
Robin, move it!

284
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,380
We're going to be late--
where's your uniform?!

285
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,382
( Doorbell rings )
Relax, Rosie,

286
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,151
it's free-dress day.

287
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,553
It means we can wear
whatever we want.

288
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,554
'Morning.

289
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,189
Yes! My new recurve!

290
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,357
What's that?

291
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,358
A bow!

292
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,759
Well, come on, let's go!

293
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,927
Man on P.A.:
Any students
interested in joining the...

294
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,630
( Continues indistinctly )
Well, here we are, boys.

295
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,431
What's all this?

296
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,666
This is extracurricular
stuff.

297
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,535
That's the soccer club.

298
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,971
My dad played soccer,
so of course I've got to play.

299
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:32,805
That's the trump club.

300
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,974
They're really weird
about bridge.

301
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,008
Cards and stuff, right?

302
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,009
Cool.

303
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
That's the computer club.

304
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,145
( Blows raspberry )
That's the checkmate club.

305
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,113
All they do is play chess.

306
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,682
( Giggles )
What's the bull's-eye club?

307
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,683
Naw, man!

308
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,684
Archery!

309
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,685
Come on, man!

310
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,287
That's prince's private club!

311
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,288
Robin McAllister.

312
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,457
I'd like to sign up, please.

313
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,425
You know how to handle
a bow and arrow?

314
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,160
I get by.

315
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,495
You "get by"?

316
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,496
Yeah.

317
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,166
( Dry chuckle ) Get lost.

318
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,168
Well, can't I at least
try out?

319
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,172
Well... that depends.

320
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,474
Where'd you learn to shoot?

321
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,509
I taught myself.

322
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,611
I used to go down to the range
behind the public golf course

323
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,612
in Kansas City.

324
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,447
In Kansas City?

325
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,216
Where's Toto?

326
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,118
A public golf course?

327
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,120
What, didn't they have
an archery range

328
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:21,987
at your country club?

329
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,123
I didn't belong
to a country club.

330
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,192
Ah! Scholarship scum!

331
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,028
I shoulda guessed.

332
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,496
I'm not on a scholarship.

333
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,133
Where'd your parents get
the money to afford this place?

334
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,134
Steal it?

335
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,535
They won the lottery.

336
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,536
The lottery?

337
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,837
Are you kidding me?

338
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:45,210
Hey! Two bucks,
and
you
can get to
Locksley.

339
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,047
Real exclusive, huh, guys?

340
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,048
Hey, hey, hey.

341
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,115
Forget it, Robin.

342
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,750
You know what? There's
a raffle you can enter

343
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,851
at the end of the month.

344
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:57,222
Or maybe you should start
a bingo club McAllister.

345
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,192
Hey, you might even win enough
money for a one-way ticket

346
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,094
back to Kansas City.

347
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,564
( Chuckles )
You know, those losers

348
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,367
probably couldn't hit
a 10-ring from 30 feet.

349
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,369
So then why do you want
to join their stupid club

350
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,370
anyways?

351
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,673
Because I'm good.

352
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,176
( Indistinct chatter )
( Enthused shouting )

353
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,291
Ohh!

354
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,360
Come on, guys,
this is soccer, not football.

355
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,828
Let's go. Get off of him.

356
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,262
Tommy, you all right?

357
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,565
Tommy. You okay, buddy?

358
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,566
Yeah, I'm okay.

359
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,567
All right.

360
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,569
Good placement.

361
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,551
Nice grouping.

362
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,554
Not bad.

363
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,790
What do
you
want?

364
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,591
I want to talk to your coach.

365
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,793
We don't
have
a coach.

366
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,794
Don't want a coach.

367
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,829
Don't
need
a coach.

368
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,297
Don't you get it?

369
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:18,437
This isn't a school sport,
it's a private club.

370
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,507
And it's full.

371
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,843
You use a release aid?

372
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,178
Yeah, that's right.

373
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,179
How come?

374
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,181
( Chuckles ) Because,
McAllister, it improves

375
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,849
your accuracy.

376
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,420
In case you hadn't noticed,
I just stuck two in the 9-ring.

377
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,155
Oh.

378
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,157
But I thought this
was supposed to be

379
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,725
the bull's-eye club.

380
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,326
Come on.

381
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,729
Let's let lottery boy try.

382
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,798
Let's see if he shoots a bow
as well as he shoots off

383
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,469
his mouth.

384
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:54,273
( Chuckles )
This bow cost 1,500 bucks.

385
00:17:54,306 --> 00:18:00,345
The boy would probably break it.

386
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,614
Newscaster:
Tragedy struck
a local family earlier today

387
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,750
when fire gutted
their southside home.

388
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,186
Reporter:
Fire investigators
have determined a leaky

389
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,488
gas line ignited
when 10-year-old Tommy tarla

390
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,657
let himself into
the family home this afternoon

391
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,925
after school.

392
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,693
Tommy, the youngest son
of Mark and Betty tarla...

393
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,894
Tommy?

394
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,163
...who were both at work
when the fire started,

395
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,399
was injured when he jumped from
this second-story window in

396
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,901
an attempt to rescue the family
dog and to escape the flames...

397
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,270
Would you like some dessert,
Robin?

398
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,272
He's currently listed
in stable condition

399
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,507
at St. Vincent's hospital.

400
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,775
Rosie: Oh, that poor boy!

401
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,076
I know him!

402
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,778
With me now is father tuck,
the parish priest from

403
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,847
St. ignacios,
the family's church.

404
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,848
Father tuck?

405
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,249
That's my church!

406
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,284
Where will the tarla family
stay now that the home has

407
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,419
been destroyed?

408
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,788
At the rectory until we can
find suitable housing.

409
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,857
Unfortunately, the tarlas
don't have insurance,

410
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,192
and Tommy will need surgery.

411
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,661
Now, these are good,
hard-working people

412
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,897
just trying to make
a better life for themselves.

413
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,365
It really is a tragedy.

414
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,900
Thank you, father.

415
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,703
A medical fund has been set up
at the local bank

416
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,404
in Tommy tarla's name.

417
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,674
You can contact St. ignacios
for further information.

418
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,543
I can't believe it.

419
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,745
He was so excited
about starting school.

420
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,547
His poor parents.

421
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,549
I'm gonna have to stop
by the rectory and see if

422
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,951
there's anything I can
do for them.

423
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,987
Wish there was something
i
could do.

424
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,556
There's always something,
Robin.

425
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,760
( Doorbell rings )
( Robin sighs )

426
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,761
Hi!

427
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,897
Hi.

428
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,432
Are you busy?

429
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:31,703
Uh... no. Not really.

430
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,572
Can I come in?

431
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,841
Yeah. Yeah. Come in.

432
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,443
It thought
you might like this back.

433
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,446
Thanks.

434
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,652
They just showed this thing
on the news today about this kid

435
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,586
I met at school.

436
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,922
His house, like, blew up
when he came home.

437
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,590
Is he all right?

438
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,326
Well, he's alive,
but he had to jump, like,

439
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,328
50 feet to get out.

440
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,464
( Sighs )
He messed himself up

441
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,634
pretty bad,
and his parents don't have

442
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,636
enough money to pay
for the hospital,

443
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,738
so there's this charity fund.

444
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,739
Wow.

445
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,608
I get 15 bucks for my allowance.

446
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,777
Well, that's not till next week.

447
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,878
Wait a second.

448
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,714
You're the one whose parents
just won the lottery.

449
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,483
Yeah, but they spend it
pretty quick.

450
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,385
You don't get it all at once.

451
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,521
Most of it went into this ranch.

452
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,523
I get less allowance
than you do.

453
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,024
Right.

454
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,793
Must be tough.

455
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:33,031
( Telephone rings )
( Robin sighs )

456
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,032
Hello?

457
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,033
Janet:
Hi, honey.

458
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,070
Um... uh, hi, mom.

459
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,071
Where are you?

460
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,506
Brussels.

461
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,678
Oh, I must say,
the concorde was amazing!

462
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,014
Couldn't I just go
to public school?

463
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,016
Locksley happens to be
the finest prep school

464
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,884
in the country. Just...

465
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,885
Give it a chance.

466
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,920
So, what have we got here?

467
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,489
So... how was your day today?

468
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,491
Well, I met this
scholarship kid,

469
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,493
and it just showed
on the news that--

470
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,395
uh, just a minute.

471
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,396
The filter!

472
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,398
Well, why don't you
tell him that, Grant?

473
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,934
Honey, your father wants
to talk to you.

474
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,935
Hi, son!

475
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,936
Hi, dad.

476
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,271
How are you?

477
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,473
Hey, listen, when that pool guy
comes around on Friday,

478
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,475
you want to have him
check out the filter?

479
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,943
You know, the machine itself?

480
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,645
Yeah, the motor's got
a hitch in it.

481
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,680
Sure, dad. Look, I was
telling mom about this family

482
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,116
in town that's house burnt down.

483
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,118
Uh-huh. That's too bad, son.

484
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,352
Is that someone you know?

485
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,389
I met their son in school,
and he got hurt really bad,

486
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,824
and they have no insurance,
so, I was just wondering

487
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,126
if we could...

488
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,028
Oh, hang on, son! I've got
some paperwork to sign!

489
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,095
Here's your mom.

490
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,066
Oh, thanks. ( Giggles )
Hi, honey, I'm back.

491
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,067
Hi, mom.

492
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,035
His name's Tommy.

493
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,403
Who?

494
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,437
The kid who got hurt.

495
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,140
There's this medical fund,
and I want to help.

496
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,708
Oh, that's nice, dear.

497
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,076
How's Rosie?

498
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,778
Rosie?

499
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,980
Uh... Rosie's fine.

500
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,816
She goes to the same church
as the tarlas.

501
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,051
Who?

502
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,520
That's their name--
people whose house burnt down.

503
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,621
Oh, I see.

504
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,857
Well, listen, dear,
um, tell Rosie we send our best.

505
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,092
All right, I'll tell her.

506
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,427
We love you, honey.

507
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,428
Okay.

508
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,696
I'll talk to you soon.

509
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,798
'Bye.
'Bye.

510
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,738
This is some setup.

511
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,473
You into computers?

512
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,941
Sometimes.

513
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,744
So, uh, you one of those
computer nerds?

514
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,680
Well, let's just say it's
one of my unique gifts.

515
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:33,485
Step aside,
watch the master work.

516
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,754
Okay.

517
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,988
What are you doing?

518
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,557
Surfing the 'net.

519
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,558
The what?

520
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,759
The Internet.

521
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:44,429
Us nerds can access information
from all over the world--

522
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,899
inside information
if you know what you're doing.

523
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,167
I know.

524
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,168
What?

525
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,169
That was today.

526
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,270
John prince.

527
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,973
His old man's supposed to be
the big cheese at one of

528
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,442
the top corporations
in the country.

529
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,044
He sure acted like it.

530
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,514
We'll see how big
he really is.

531
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,516
I can't follow it.

532
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,519
Here. Maybe this'll help.

533
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,754
Female voice:
Good evening.

534
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,624
Sound card voice recognition
system activated.

535
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,659
Forbes 500 top corporations.

536
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,528
It talks?

537
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,196
It listens too.

538
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,799
Now, if I could only get it
to do my homework.

539
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:27,806
Computer, find prince,
John, sr.

540
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,875
Prince, John, sr.
Chief executive officer

541
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,743
of prince American corporation.

542
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,213
Gross sales previous year,
five billion U.S. dollars.

543
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,549
That's amazing!

544
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,951
Five billion dollars.

545
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,854
It's disgusting, is what it is.

546
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,828
I'm starting to think
this isn't such a good idea.

547
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,229
Why not?

548
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,698
Well, for starters,
I don't know a thing

549
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,933
about archery.

550
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,902
Well, you're pretty good
with a slingshot, and, I mean,

551
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,903
it's the same principle.

552
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,037
Yeah, but a slingshot.

553
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,773
You're not afraid of
prince and those geeks, are you?

554
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:02,774
No way!

555
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,676
Then just do what I say.

556
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,979
There's nothing to it.

557
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,589
Hold this.

558
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,029
Get out of my way,
McAllister. Coach has me

559
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,131
running laps, and i'm, like,
a mile behind already.

560
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,133
So why don't you take up
a more civilized sport,

561
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,201
like archery.

562
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,637
What? You mean
with prince and his bozos? I--

563
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:33,505
forget it!

564
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,141
Robin and I are forming
our own club.

565
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,143
Well, I'm real happy
for you guys, but i-i

566
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,678
really gotta get going.

567
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,746
You're joining the club,
little.

568
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,682
Stop it, okay?

569
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,817
Not until you join archery.

570
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,152
Stop it!

571
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,286
Not until you join the club.

572
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,156
Let me past!

573
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,157
Ohh. Okay. That's it.

574
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,158
All right.

575
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,893
That's it, that's it.

576
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,894
That's how you wanna play?

577
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,895
Let's go, little.

578
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:02,767
You guys, um...

579
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,670
Isn't there a better way
we could settle this?

580
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,672
You guys realize this is
why they formed

581
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,307
the united nations.

582
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,211
Come on, guys. Please.

583
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,986
( Staff splashes )
Oh, no!

584
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,655
Ha ha ha!

585
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,824
Ha ha ha!

586
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,592
Ha ha ha! I told you!

587
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,196
Little John: Ha ha ha!

588
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,197
It's not funny.

589
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,798
Ha ha ha!

590
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,966
Oh! Oh! You know something?

591
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,967
I hate soccer.

592
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:43,208
Maybe I will join
you guys' club after all.

593
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,845
The most important thing
about archery

594
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:51,216
is that you're completely
relaxed at the time you fire.

595
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,686
The bow is stretched.

596
00:25:54,719 --> 00:26:00,225
There's tension in the string,
but you-- you are totally

597
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,927
at ease.

598
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,862
Will: Awesome!

599
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,131
All right, you try.

600
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,133
Draw the string back
a couple of times,

601
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,136
just to get the feel for it.

602
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,707
Yes! Good shot!

603
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,708
Way to go.

604
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,744
All right, will.

605
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,048
It's hard to pull.

606
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,817
Yeah, at the beginning,
but then it gets easier

607
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,053
as your arm gets stronger.

608
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,754
Good shot.

609
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,424
( Arrow whizzes )
What?!

610
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,826
Hey, why don't you watch
where you're aiming that thing?

611
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,828
If I was aiming
for you, lard butt,

612
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,397
I wouldn't have missed.

613
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,399
Geez, what happened to you?

614
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,436
You fall off one of those nags
your parents are trying to sell?

615
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,937
Why don't you wait your turn?

616
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,839
We're practicing here.

617
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,141
( Chuckles )
No, you're not.

618
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,811
The money for those targets
comes from us.

619
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,879
Yeah. They're
private property.

620
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,148
You want to practice?

621
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:02,120
Dip into that lottery money,
buy some of your own.

622
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,789
I got a better idea.

623
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,258
Why don't you girls
take your arrows

624
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,259
and go sit on 'em.

625
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,931
( Lads chuckling )
Who's gonna make us?

626
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,901
You?

627
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,003
Ow.

628
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,004
Unh!

629
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:19,938
Will: Hey!

630
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,340
( Audibly struggling )
Get off me,

631
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,115
You little weasel!

632
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,784
Guys?

633
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,855
( Blows whistle )
Hey, break it up!

634
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,391
Get off!

635
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:46,231
( Indistinct comments )
Coach: Break it up.

636
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,833
What's going on here, guys?

637
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,102
They're using our
archery targets, sir,

638
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,804
and they are private property.

639
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,873
If you don't believe us,
ask Mr. Harvey, sir.

640
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,908
My father and Mr. Harvey
arranged it, sir.

641
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,813
You-- you do know my father?

642
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,815
Mr. McAllister,
maybe you can get your own

643
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,216
archery targets.

644
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,419
Little, come on, you've missed
enough soccer practice.

645
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,420
Let's go.

646
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,921
I, uh, I quit.

647
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,256
Excuse me?

648
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,258
I'm joining the new
archery club--

649
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,027
Robin's new archery club.

650
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,830
Coach: All right, guys,
just keep away from them.

651
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,098
It's not the targets.

652
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,100
I mean, some people got
everything and don't

653
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,502
appreciate it, while others
got nothing.

654
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,038
I think it's called life
Rob.

655
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah, and in case
you haven't heard,

656
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,777
it stinks, man.

657
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,517
Nurse on P.A.:
Dr. Kennedy
to O.R., code blue.

658
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,219
Hey, Tommy.

659
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:45,390
Brought you something.

660
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,525
Hi.

661
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,261
Wow. An electronic chess set?

662
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,296
Thanks!

663
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,297
Do you remember me?

664
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,265
I'm Robin.

665
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,867
Robin? From the 'hood?

666
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,003
No, I go to Locksley.

667
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,338
We met on the steps.

668
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,874
Oh, yeah.

669
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,877
That wasn't my week.

670
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,847
Right here?

671
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,415
So...

672
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,150
How you feeling?

673
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,151
Not too bad.

674
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,419
This thing itches, though.

675
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,554
Have you ever had an itch
you can't scratch?

676
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,124
Oh, I hate it
when that happens.

677
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,126
So, they told you
when they're letting you out?

678
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,127
They won't say.

679
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,528
I want to go now.

680
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,796
I can imagine.

681
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,065
We should probably stick around
till they tell you it's okay.

682
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,533
I guess so.

683
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,503
Can I get you anything?

684
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,104
A new
megaman
would be good.

685
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,008
I've read this one
about 20 times already.

686
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,178
Well, I'll tell you what--
I'll see what I can do for you,

687
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,113
okay, Tommy?

688
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,269
Rosie: Robbie,
your friends are here!

689
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,272
Send 'em up!

690
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,008
Hey, Rob!

691
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,178
Hey, guys.

692
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,381
Hey, Rob!

693
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,449
( Will laughs )
Hey, wait a minute--

694
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,551
prince American corp.?

695
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,020
What, are you stealing money
from prince's old man?

696
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,555
It's not like it's for me.

697
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,557
Do you know how much money
was donated to the tarla

698
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,593
medical fund? A hundred
and fifty stinking bucks!

699
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,996
Nobody cares, and Tommy needs
another operation,

700
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,265
and operations cost.

701
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,401
I already transferred money
from my parents' account.

702
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,403
I'll deal with that
when they get home.

703
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,040
Prince has got more money
than he knows what to do with.

704
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,175
You know that company raked in
more than five billion

705
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,176
last year?

706
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,177
Shut up!

707
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,345
See?

708
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,347
My dad works for
this big company.

709
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,349
They give away money
all the time.

710
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,185
There are people there,
that's all they do.

711
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,254
Computer...

712
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,289
List company charity divisions.

713
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,024
Corporate division
management.

714
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,559
Told you. Permanent
charities division.

715
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,461
Cool. Let's see where
they're sending the money to.

716
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,598
( Horse whinnies )
Permanent charities division,

717
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,601
Lucille pettigrew,
division manager.

718
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,603
It's a girl!

719
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,205
What?

720
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,142
Robin: Come on, guys!

721
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,143
Come on!

722
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,311
Will: Hey!

723
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,713
Hi! Hey!

724
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,582
I got the 15 bucks
for that family now.

725
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,184
I don't need it anymore.

726
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,151
What?

727
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,620
I'll explain later.

728
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,655
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

729
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,657
Okay. See you later.

730
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,060
( Clicks tongue )
Rob-- Robin!

731
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,162
Who was that babe on the horse?

732
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,531
The wrangler's daughter.

733
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,002
Computer, request further
information on permanent

734
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,236
charities division.

735
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,238
Did you check out
that outfit?

736
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,574
Yeah, I think I'm going
to take up horseback riding.

737
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:52,577
Donations, year to date:
$2.8 million.

738
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,746
Wow! They
do
give a lot!

739
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,448
So maybe they wouldn't mind
giving a little more.

740
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,517
Yeah, yeah, but just
remember, it's not gonna be

741
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,519
as easy to explain this
as it will be to explain

742
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:02,553
to your parents.

743
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,522
I think I can increase
the amount they give

744
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,125
to existing charities
and transfer it to the tarla

745
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,126
medical account later.

746
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,627
What's the date?

747
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,130
The 22nd. Why?

748
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,166
They're scheduled to make
a big contribution in four days.

749
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,335
Maybe it can be a little bigger.

750
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,603
( Chuckles ) You can do that?

751
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,438
I can try.

752
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:25,343
Computer, request code number
for donation increases.

753
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,744
Come on...

754
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,580
Come on! Come on!

755
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,749
Request denied.

756
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,318
Nuts!

757
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,320
Do not recognize
this command.

758
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,721
( Laughing ) Nice work, Rob.

759
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,056
Very impressive.

760
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,324
You wanna try?

761
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,458
Oh, um...

762
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,627
Listen, I've got to get
back to the dorm, so, you know,

763
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,362
I'll see you later, man.

764
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,130
Yeah, man, me too.

765
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,666
You can't snag money
off the net.

766
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,036
No company's gonna be that dumb.

767
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,042
You gotta be on the inside.

768
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,185
Or sound like you are.

769
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:34,278
( Modem dialing )
( Telephone ringing )

770
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,549
( Telephone rings )
Mr. Prince's office.

771
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,584
May I help you?

772
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,285
( Mature voice )
Mr. Prince, please.

773
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,121
May I say who's calling?

774
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,857
This is Edward...

775
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,092
Forest. Forest.

776
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,660
Mr. Forest-forest?

777
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,661
No, no, no.

778
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,363
Just... one forest.

779
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,598
We went to school together.

780
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,533
Just one moment, please.

781
00:33:55,566 --> 00:34:00,505
( Sighs ) Thanks.

782
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,374
Robin, are you up?

783
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,777
Uh, yeah, Rosie.

784
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,380
Mr. Prince, there's
a Mr. Forest on line one.

785
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,483
Says he went to school
with you.

786
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,451
Can I come in?

787
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,819
No! Why not?

788
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,354
Because i'm...

789
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,823
Hello? ...Naked.

790
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,224
Who are you talking to?

791
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,492
Hello?

792
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,894
Hi.

793
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,863
No, I-I mean good morning,
Mr. Prince.

794
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,433
Forest? And you say
we went to school together.

795
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,535
Well, now, would that be
Yale or choate?

796
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,136
Oh, I'm sorry.

797
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,838
This must be the wrong
John prince.

798
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,907
Sorry to bother you.

799
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,443
( Click )
Ethel?

800
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,477
Yes, Mr. Prince?

801
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,579
I didn't even know
who that was.

802
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,415
Do a better job of screening
my calls, will you?

803
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:49,287
I'm busy here.

804
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,755
Aaarrgghhh!

805
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,430
Forest.

806
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,499
Now you say we went
to school together?

807
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,401
Would that be Yale or...

808
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,908
Robin, are you all right?

809
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,510
Yale or choate?

810
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,579
Uh, I'm just playing
a new video game.

811
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,581
Well, hurry up
and get dressed or you're

812
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,182
gonna be late for school.

813
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,417
I don't mind.

814
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,384
Forest.

815
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,453
( Voices melding )
Now, you say we went

816
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,387
to school together?

817
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,257
Would that be Yale or choate?

818
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,492
Forest.

819
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,494
And you say we went
to school together?

820
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,396
Would that be Yale or choate?

821
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,504
Yes!

822
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:45,276
( Modem dialing )
( Telephone ringing )

823
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,812
Woman:
Good morning,
prince America corporation.

824
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,280
Permanent charities, please.

825
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,481
One moment, please.

826
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:57,288
( Telephones ringing )
Charities, this is Lucille.

827
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,457
( Prince, sr.'S voice )
Hello, Lucille?

828
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,692
This is Mr. Prince.

829
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,960
Mr. Prince?

830
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,562
Good morning, Mr. Prince.

831
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,230
Same to you, Lucille.

832
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,699
Listen, on our greater
Richmond youth foundation

833
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,935
payment due on
the twenty-sixth...

834
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,036
Yes?

835
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:16,307
Increase it by another
$5,000, okay?

836
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,743
I-Is that a permanent
adjustment, sir?

837
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,511
Uh, no.

838
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,712
Just this one time.

839
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:26,250
I'll see to it right away,
sir. Goodbye, Mr. Prince.

840
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,718
Thank you, Lucille.

841
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,987
Goodbye.

842
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,790
Yes!

843
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,864
( Indistinct comment )
John: And she bought it?

844
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,466
Yep. There's 5,000 extra
bucks in the Richmond

845
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,735
youth account I can wire-
transfer anywhere I want.

846
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,004
Cool. See, I got their
account number off e-mail.

847
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,673
Nice.

848
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,675
But how you gonna get it
so they don't trace it

849
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,676
back to you?

850
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,678
Well, I haven't quite
figured that out yet.

851
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,414
That's easy. See, you phone
banks all across the country,

852
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,482
right, and you set up a bunch
of fake bank accounts

853
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,750
under a phony name.

854
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,619
And then you bounce the money
from one account to the other

855
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,989
until you're not even sure
where it's been.

856
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,991
I saw it on one of those
true crime shows.

857
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,360
If the guy hadn't had a live
gerbil sent to the post office

858
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:13,497
box he was working out of,
he never would have been caught.

859
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,467
You're a genius.

860
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,004
Get him! Ha! Noogies!

861
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,974
Man: Taxi!

862
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,586
So I can do all my banking
electronically, right?

863
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,389
Woman:
Yes, but I will need
a signature card for our files.

864
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,457
Have it sent to you.

865
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,392
Can you send it to my
p.O. Box? It's hard for me

866
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,627
to get into the bank.

867
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,562
Of course, sir,
and as soon as you return it

868
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,498
to us with your deposit,
you'll be in business.

869
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,401
Cool. I mean, um, thank you.

870
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,970
And thank you for choosing
the people's bank of Seattle.

871
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:53,971
Have a nice day.

872
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,407
Okay. See you later.

873
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,808
Uh, don't worry, ma'am.

874
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,944
Everything checks out just fine.

875
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,946
Yeah. We're with
the phone company.

876
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,481
Field testers.

877
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,450
So, uh...

878
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,590
( Clearing throat )
Mr. Prince!

879
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,593
Ms. Pettigrew, what is this?

880
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,063
It's the $5,000 donation
increase you requested

881
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,765
for the greater Richmond
youth foundation, sir.

882
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,767
I did not request
an increase.

883
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,769
They get more than enough
as it is.

884
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,471
But the phone call...

885
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,872
I... you...

886
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:09,146
I want a full explanation,
and I want it now.

887
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,749
Boy: Hey, Bronson, wait up!

888
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,486
Though it may
seem
cruel,
man has long used

889
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,155
lesser life forms
to further his

890
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,625
scientific knowledge,
in yet another example

891
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,463
of Darwin's theory of
survival of the fittest.

892
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,499
We dissect frogs
so that we may better

893
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,670
understand... ourselves.

894
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,705
McAllister's a lesser
life form. Maybe we should

895
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,440
dissect him.

896
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:40,177
Question, Mr. Prince?

897
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,245
Yes, sir.

898
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,881
I was just wondering
if these frogs felt any pain

899
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:47,184
as they left this world, sir.

900
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,587
None at all, Mr. Prince,
though it's very compassionate

901
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,588
of you to ask.

902
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,388
Thank you, sir.

903
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,758
Such high praise,
coming from you.

904
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,959
Mm-hmm.

905
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:55,960
Go ahead.

906
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,228
Begin the dissection.

907
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,830
Mr. Harvey, sir,
can I ask you a question?

908
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:00,831
Unh-unh.

909
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,634
Let it go, munchkin.

910
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,937
Sit down, fatso.

911
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,147
Aahhh!

912
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,148
Water! Water!

913
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,150
Mr. McAllister!

914
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:24,221
( Gasping )
( Lads laughing )

915
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,223
I suppose it would be
too much to ask

916
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,558
what you are doing!

917
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,959
I had a frog in my...

918
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,227
Spare me.

919
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,829
Explain it all later...

920
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,564
At detention.

921
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,966
Is there anything
I can do to help, sir?

922
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,870
It's fine. Thank you.

923
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,582
Nice shot.

924
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,585
Thanks.

925
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,724
I'm not bothering you, am I?

926
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,662
No, not at all.

927
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,030
Your dad called my dad today.

928
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,631
They bought a horse!

929
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,200
Great. Just what they need.

930
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,202
Sounds like a beauty--
Chestnut stallion,

931
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,004
four white stockings.

932
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,141
Five-foot wingspread,
three legs,

933
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:21,912
and a beak.

934
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:22,913
Yeah?

935
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,982
Robin, you're not listening.

936
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,718
( Sighs ) Sorry.

937
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,887
What'd you do,
stay up all night?

938
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,822
Pretty close.

939
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,726
Look, can you keep a secret?

940
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,127
Robin, you've got to stop it.

941
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,128
Cancel it right away!

942
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,096
No way!

943
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,632
There's no more money
in the medical fund.

944
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,634
It's only been
a couple of days.

945
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,636
So? There's no more
TV coverage.

946
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,171
It's old news!

947
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,807
They'll be lucky if they
can get another ten bucks!

948
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,941
You could go to jail.

949
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,043
I'm too young to go to jail.

950
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:56,180
Besides, we're not gonna
get caught.

951
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,782
I only took $5,000,
and the prince American

952
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,785
corporation donates something
like $250,000 a year

953
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,053
to charity anyways.

954
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,322
Well, if they donate so much
to charity anyway, why didn't

955
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,290
you just ask for some?

956
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,926
( Sighs ) You can't
just ask for money.

957
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,328
You've got to have suction.

958
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,998
And let's suppose I was to try
to go through proper channels.

959
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,901
You know how long
that would take?

960
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,003
Tommy needs that money now.

961
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,005
But won't he need
to pay it back anyway

962
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,773
when you get caught?

963
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:27,678
Look, I told you,
we're not gonna get caught.

964
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,848
You see, how it works is that--
Robin, don't even tell me.

965
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,285
I don't want to hear it.

966
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,355
Robin, I'm scared for you.

967
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:48,832
Look, all I'm doing
is ripping off the rich

968
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,201
to give to the poor.

969
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,104
I mean, what's wrong with that?

970
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,406
I don't know.

971
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:59,143
Something, probably.

972
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,612
So you're gonna turn me in?

973
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,918
No.

974
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,988
Unless, of course,
they torture me,

975
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,259
or offer me money.

976
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,331
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

977
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,000
Got it right here. Looks good.

978
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,804
Who the hell are you?

979
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:31,408
Agent Walter Nottingham.

980
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:36,080
F.b.i.

981
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,016
This theft appears to have
crossed state lines, Mr. Prince.

982
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,051
That's why the detectives
you reported it to

983
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,386
turned it over to the f.B.I.

984
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:47,091
Now, according to this file,
your controller,

985
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,426
miss pettigrew,
says the order for

986
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,997
the extra $5,000 came from you.

987
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,065
No, it was someone
impersonating me.

988
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,301
Someone... or some
thing?

989
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,037
What do you mean?

990
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,973
A computer microphone
hooked up to a sound card

991
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:06,043
can capture the wavelengths
of a person's voice.

992
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,846
( Clanking sound overhead )
You're saying it was

993
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,048
a computer?

994
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,050
Run by someone
who certainly knows

995
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,185
what they're doing and has had
access to your voice.

996
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,187
Now, I'm gonna need
a log of your phone calls

997
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,289
from the date of
the embezzlement going back

998
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,891
as far as say, two weeks.

999
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,926
Fine, fine.

1000
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,462
So it had to be someone
who called me.

1001
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,465
Maybe.

1002
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,400
Maybe not.

1003
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,770
Any decent hacker
could have tapped into

1004
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,938
your telephone conversations
without your ever being

1005
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,274
aware of it.

1006
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,077
Maybe. Maybe not.

1007
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,048
Don't waste my time
with maybes, Mr. Nottingham.

1008
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,350
I want you to catch this rodent.

1009
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,820
Fast!

1010
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,854
Yes, sir.

1011
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,392
Did you transfer the money
into Tommy's medical fund yet?

1012
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,394
Hey, genius,
there's a lot of steps.

1013
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,228
These things take time.

1014
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,397
I... thought you said
it was easy?

1015
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,298
It is. For me.

1016
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,835
I'm... just being careful,
that's all.

1017
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,538
Oh, no. Not this again.

1018
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:08,806
What?

1019
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,141
It's the renaissance faire
Dean Harvey started last year.

1020
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,444
Yeah, he says he can
make money for the school,

1021
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,446
but if you ask me,
it's just another excuse

1022
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,981
to get him in tights.

1023
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,384
What are you gonna
dress up as, little John? A pig?

1024
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,452
Shut up, Warner.

1025
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,121
Uh-oh. Piggy's getting angry.

1026
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,323
Hey, hey. Chill.

1027
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,524
They're not worth it.

1028
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,525
Hey.

1029
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,394
Check this out.

1030
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,995
An archery tournament.

1031
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,897
An all-comers!

1032
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,899
Looks like the rest of us
will finally get a chance

1033
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:36,900
to shoot, huh?

1034
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,303
( Chuckles ) Ahh.

1035
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,305
All you're gonna have
a chance to do

1036
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,173
is embarrass yourself.

1037
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,175
Yeah?

1038
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,078
Well, just be there
so I can see your face

1039
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:57,454
when my arrow hits
the bull's-eye.

1040
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,356
Hey, man, forget 'em.

1041
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,859
We got more important
things to do.

1042
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,927
We couldn't have done this
at your house?

1043
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,830
Yeah, but this is better.

1044
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,899
You see, the more computers
I log on to, the harder

1045
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:13,203
it is to trace.

1046
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,171
Here it goes.

1047
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,273
It's finally arrived
in the Seattle accounts.

1048
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,909
So, uh, who's
William Johnson?

1049
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,945
Nobody. It's a name
I used for the accounts.

1050
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,214
Now, all I need
is the account number

1051
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:27,951
for Tommy's medical fund.

1052
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,354
Bingo. I am so good.

1053
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,355
Modest too.

1054
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,523
And don't forget handsome.

1055
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:38,962
Definitely handsome.

1056
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,532
( Triumphal sounds )
There it goes.

1057
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,533
What, that's it?

1058
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,134
All five thousand bucks?

1059
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,169
Just like that.

1060
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,170
All right, Robin!

1061
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,138
Yeah!

1062
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,072
Gentlemen, please.

1063
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,241
This is a computer lab,
not a sports bar.

1064
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,110
Sorry, Mr. Harvey, sir.

1065
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,246
We were just excited about
the learning potential

1066
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,116
when one accesses
the information superhighway

1067
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,653
on the Internet,
Mr. Harvey, sir.

1068
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:03,687
What are you working on?

1069
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,123
( Overlapping comments )
Actually, sir,

1070
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,525
it's an independent project
that we've been working on.

1071
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,162
Mm-hmm.

1072
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,464
Well, that's fine.

1073
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,500
( Exhales )
But make sure you do your

1074
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,269
regular schoolwork first, hmm?

1075
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,304
For sure. Thank you, sir.

1076
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,305
Nottingham?

1077
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,306
John prince here.

1078
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,541
What's the latest?

1079
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,044
We traced the diverted funds
to the first bank of Manhattan.

1080
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,412
So the thief's in New York?

1081
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,413
Well, why didn't you call me?

1082
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,547
I have friends there.

1083
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,516
Because the money has
already been wire-transferred

1084
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,518
to the Gulf bank
of St. Petersburg.

1085
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,086
What? So he's in Florida?

1086
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,088
Could be a she.

1087
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,691
The funds were then transferred
to Chicago guaranteed trust.

1088
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,026
Chicago? Well, then,
let me guess.

1089
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,561
They're not there anymore.

1090
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,197
The bank manager's checking
to see where they went,

1091
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,334
but in each instance,
the name on the account--

1092
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,003
William Johnson.

1093
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,974
False address,
false social security number.

1094
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,976
So this "Johnson"
could be anyone?

1095
00:47:59,009 --> 00:47:59,910
No.

1096
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:06,216
No. Someone very specific,
and very smart.

1097
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,052
All right,
take your stance.

1098
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,053
Relax.

1099
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,188
All right!

1100
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,189
Let's go, little.

1101
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:16,326
See what you got.

1102
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,095
There you go.

1103
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,338
Man, you are
deadly!

1104
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,007
I'll
never
be that good.

1105
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,008
Keep practicing.

1106
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,075
I mean, who knows?

1107
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,211
Just think how much better
you are now than when

1108
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,581
you first started.

1109
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:47,357
Yeah.

1110
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,693
All right! We're gonna sweep
that all-comers. I mean,

1111
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:52,229
you guys can fight for second,
and, of course, I'll take first,

1112
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,230
right?

1113
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,132
Marion: Hey, Robin.

1114
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,166
Hey. What's up, Marion?

1115
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,701
Would you close your mouth?

1116
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,270
Your gonna drool on your bow.

1117
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,739
Marion fitzwater,
this is will Scarlet

1118
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,109
and John little,
otherwise known as little John.

1119
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,110
Hey.

1120
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,312
Hey!

1121
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,314
They're doing time
at Locksley too.

1122
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,182
John: Uhhh....

1123
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,217
Haven't seen you around
much lately.

1124
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,219
Oh, well, I've been
kind of busy.

1125
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,221
With your, uh,
computer project?

1126
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,222
Yeah.

1127
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,157
You told her?

1128
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,225
What, you don't think
you can trust me?

1129
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,395
I-I'd trust you with my life.

1130
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:29,399
( Groans )
So, how's it going, though?

1131
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:32,536
Great. Listen, um,
you've got to swear

1132
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,471
you won't say anything.

1133
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:38,542
( Telephone rings )
St. ignacios parish.

1134
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:39,509
Father tuck speaking.

1135
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,545
( Mature voice )
Hi, father tuck?

1136
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,147
I'm calling to see if you
received a donation recently

1137
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,450
for the tarla medical fund.

1138
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,052
Yes. Uh, are you Mr. Johnson?

1139
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,688
No, no, no. No. An associate.

1140
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,157
No, I'm his associate.

1141
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,828
Mr. Johnson just wanted to know
if you received the money.

1142
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,564
Oh, yes we did, praise god.

1143
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,433
Five thousand dollars
transferred into the account

1144
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,369
like manna from heaven.

1145
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,305
Uh, if I could, though, I...

1146
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,707
Really would like to thank
Mr. Johnson personally.

1147
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,844
So would the tarlas.

1148
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,846
Uh, I'm afraid
that's impossible.

1149
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,115
Mr. Johnson's a very shy man.

1150
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,717
A hermit practically.

1151
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,319
He hates publicity.

1152
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,321
Well, I wouldn't want
to intrude on his privacy,

1153
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:29,126
but, uh, please
give him our deepest gratitude.

1154
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,460
Yeah, I will.

1155
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,461
Goodbye.

1156
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,864
Bye-bye.

1157
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,466
( Marion giggles )
A hermit?

1158
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,135
Okay, it was a little lame.

1159
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,838
At least they got the money
and we got away with it.

1160
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,241
So you can stop now, right?

1161
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,742
I guess so.

1162
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,511
You
guess
so?

1163
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,845
Are you crazy?

1164
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,481
You're right.

1165
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:55,218
Why take our chances?

1166
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,721
I'll close the accounts
as soon as I can.

1167
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:58,622
Promise?

1168
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:02,225
( Door opens )
Yeah, I promise.

1169
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,494
Would your friends like
to stay for dinner, Robin?

1170
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:05,896
Uh, guys?

1171
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,464
Uh, no, thank you.

1172
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,534
Uh, yeah. We have to be
getting back to the dorm.

1173
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,636
I have to go too.

1174
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:16,173
Remember, you promised.

1175
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,509
I know.

1176
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,511
I was thinking of
going to see Tommy

1177
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,512
in the hospital tomorrow.

1178
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,513
Would you like to come?

1179
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,514
Sure.

1180
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,582
Good.

1181
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,551
'Cause I was talking
to his mother, and she said

1182
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,519
he could really use the company.

1183
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,522
( P.A. announcement )
Doctor: Let me reassure you,

1184
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,524
Mr. and Mrs. Tarla,
Tommy's doing very well.

1185
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,927
I just examined him,
had a look at his x-rays

1186
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,629
and his lab tests,
and I'm fully confident

1187
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,631
one more procedure
on Tommy's leg

1188
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,266
will restore full function.

1189
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,468
Another operation?

1190
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,837
Well, there's a lot of
medical jargon I could give you,

1191
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,272
but let's just say yes,
Tommy needs it.

1192
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,707
Thank you, doctor.

1193
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,275
Nurse on P.A.:
All available
personnel to the west wing,

1194
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,210
code white.

1195
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,946
Well, that's wonderful
news, isn't it?

1196
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,547
Tommy will be good as new.

1197
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,549
Yes, but the money
in the fund barely covers

1198
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,218
the cost to date.

1199
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,220
That's not enough for
another operation.

1200
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,255
Father tuck: Now, Mark,
I know you're worried

1201
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,724
about the costs, but have faith.

1202
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,693
Somehow the lord will provide.

1203
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,696
Yes, i'm
sure
he will.

1204
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:16,466
Robin, come and say hello
to the tarlas.

1205
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,467
Hi.

1206
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,436
This is Robin McAllister.

1207
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,471
He and Tommy go to school
together.

1208
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,607
Well, you're a lucky boy.

1209
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,575
Locksley's a fine school.

1210
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,445
Yeah, I-I guess it is.

1211
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,447
You know, it's funny,
but I feel like I know you

1212
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,617
somehow.

1213
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,352
Um, I don't think so.

1214
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,888
No? ( Chuckles )
And how is little Tommy,

1215
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,826
father?

1216
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:47,330
Oh, he is doing better,
though the additional surgery

1217
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,733
is gonna cost more
than it was first thought,

1218
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:55,472
even with the money
from Mr. Johnson.

1219
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,240
Mr. Johnson?

1220
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,018
$10,000 more?

1221
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:11,354
( Laughing )
Blessed father,

1222
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,961
thank you for sending us
Mr. Johnson,

1223
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,630
and if he's committed
any sins in his life,

1224
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:21,698
forgive him!

1225
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:26,369
And if he wishes to remain
a mystery man, let him!

1226
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:29,506
( Soft knock )
Robin? It's Marion.

1227
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:33,510
Rosie isn't here,
but the door was open, so i--

1228
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,479
Robin?

1229
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,426
Father tuck?

1230
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,669
What's this?

1231
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,671
What were you doing
in my room?

1232
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,807
Looking for you,
and don't change the subject!

1233
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,809
You told me you were
going to stop.

1234
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,811
I know, but I couldn't.

1235
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,980
Tommy needs another operation,
and father tuck's--

1236
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,982
you think father tuck
would accept that money

1237
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:12,983
if he knew how you got it?

1238
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,417
That's why I didn't tell him.

1239
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,953
You can't keep ripping off
that company!

1240
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,955
I know.

1241
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,690
That's why I branched out.

1242
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:21,958
No!

1243
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,694
How many?

1244
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:28,098
Well...

1245
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:31,534
This is to let father tuck
know about number three,

1246
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,703
all transferred from companies
run by fathers of

1247
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,438
the richest snobs at Locksley.

1248
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,440
I'm not gonna let you
send it.

1249
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,442
It's already
in the medical fund.

1250
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,443
Well, then, take it out!

1251
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,112
Put it back where you got it!

1252
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,114
Do you want Tommy to walk
with a limp for the rest

1253
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,248
of his life?

1254
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,951
I mean, do you want him
not to be able to play baseball

1255
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,986
or ride a bike just because
he broke some bones

1256
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,355
and there's not enough
money to pay for it?

1257
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,356
Is that what you want?

1258
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,624
Of course I don't.

1259
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,626
Neither do I.

1260
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,997
It's been ten days
since I popped the prince

1261
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,866
American corporation.

1262
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,135
Let me show you how easy it was.

1263
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,970
Sure that's a good idea?

1264
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,471
They might have set a trap.

1265
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,472
Don't worry.

1266
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:13,877
All I'm gonna do
is joyride through their e-mail.

1267
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,878
Look at that.

1268
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:15,845
What?

1269
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,815
They're producing
eight hundred million

1270
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,017
in sales this quarter alone.

1271
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,019
What's a measly 5,000 to them?

1272
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,755
They probably won't
even notice, huh?

1273
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:30,527
Female voice:
Audit notice.

1274
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,528
Uh-oh.

1275
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,897
What?

1276
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,365
They noticed.

1277
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,640
This is Mr. Prince,
prince American corporation.

1278
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,842
This is kind of embarrassing,
but we just discovered that

1279
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,812
the $5,000 embezzlement
I reported was actually

1280
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,747
a clerical error.

1281
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,749
The truth is,
nothing's missing.

1282
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,951
No need to look any further,
but thanks loads for your help.

1283
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,487
'Bye.

1284
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,791
No need to look any further,
but thanks loads

1285
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,026
for your help. 'Bye.

1286
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,664
"Thanks loads for your help"?

1287
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,499
I don't think so.

1288
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:15,205
That's right,
close the account.

1289
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,174
Thank you.

1290
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,233
Well? Done.

1291
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,234
All of it?

1292
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,703
Closed every account.

1293
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,738
What if they keep
looking for you?

1294
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,206
There's nothing left to find.

1295
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,975
I mean, it's the f.B.I.

1296
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,977
Don't you think they have
better things to do

1297
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,678
than look for a...

1298
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,581
Measly $30,000?

1299
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,717
$30,000?!

1300
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,787
I jacked up the donations
the last couple of times.

1301
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,788
Tommy really needed it.

1302
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,923
Tommy needed it,
or you
need it?

1303
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,759
Hey, this has
nothing
to do with me!

1304
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,795
Oh, this has
everything
to do with you--

1305
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,830
how smart you are,
how much you want to show up

1306
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:14,864
those rich kids at school!

1307
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,733
You're wrong.

1308
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,136
Okay, maybe not totally,
but it's over. Done.

1309
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,139
I mean, there's no way
they can catch me now!

1310
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,008
Robin, I'm worried.

1311
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,143
So don't think about it.

1312
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,144
Don't think about it?

1313
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,612
Yeah. You're crazy.

1314
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,682
Crazy, wacko, bonkers, mad!

1315
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,285
( Laughing )
What is that?

1316
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,486
I'm just dancing.

1317
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,022
Dancing? It looks more
like you stepped in something

1318
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,024
out in the corral.

1319
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,026
You're saying
you can do better?

1320
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,895
This horse could do better.

1321
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,630
Go ahead.

1322
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,033
Show us how it's done.

1323
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:54,170
Okay.

1324
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,906
Come on.

1325
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,042
What, you need me?

1326
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,044
Real dancing
takes two people,

1327
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,045
like this.

1328
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:02,879
No.

1329
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,649
Come on,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1330
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,919
Okay, give me your hand.

1331
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,054
Like this.

1332
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,156
Put your other hand on me.

1333
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:14,290
Little higher.

1334
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,291
Sorry.

1335
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,628
'Kay, it's gonna start slow,
and then quick.

1336
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,629
Okay.

1337
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,830
Start with this foot.

1338
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,299
Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow.

1339
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,669
Slow, slow, quick-quick--
oww! ( Giggles )

1340
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:27,470
Sorry.

1341
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:30,773
Slow, slow,
quick-quick, slow.

1342
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,175
Quick-quick, slow.

1343
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,176
Good!

1344
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:34,878
Can we stop now?

1345
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:35,879
No.

1346
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,581
Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow.

1347
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,650
Slow, slow, quick-quick--
you know, you're not

1348
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,318
actually a total spaz.

1349
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,054
You tell my friends,
I'll
never
talk to you again.

1350
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,623
( Chuckles ) You ready?

1351
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:51,227
Go ahead.

1352
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,829
Are you ready?

1353
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,830
What?

1354
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,698
For this.

1355
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,300
( Marion giggles )
( Horse whinnies )

1356
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,927
( Marion giggles )
So, you're closing in on him?

1357
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,870
I must be.

1358
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,005
You left a message on my
answering machine last night

1359
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,841
saying that the embezzlement
was a clerical error,

1360
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,110
that I should drop
the whole case.

1361
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,645
I did no such thing!

1362
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,314
Of course not.

1363
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:45,915
It was the thief.

1364
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,250
Had to be.

1365
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:50,053
But I'll tell you,
he's got your voice programmed

1366
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,755
about as well as it can be done,
I'll give him that.

1367
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,924
Well, wouldn't he realize
that you'd check with me

1368
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,192
to confirm the message?

1369
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,428
You'd think so.

1370
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:01,064
He obviously knows
he's been discovered.

1371
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,732
Maybe he panicked.

1372
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,234
Maybe he's just creating
whatever diversions he can

1373
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:12,175
to, uh, cover his tracks
before we find him.

1374
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:16,045
So how
are
you going
to find him?

1375
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,047
Well, for one thing,
I found out where

1376
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,048
your money ended up.

1377
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,316
And where is that?

1378
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:26,923
( Nut ricochets )
A bank... in Seattle.

1379
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,924
Seattle?

1380
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,325
That mean something to you?

1381
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,293
Not really.

1382
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:34,931
My son goes to boarding
school there, but...

1383
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,799
How, uh, how old's your son?

1384
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,835
Sixteen. Why?

1385
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:39,836
That's a tough age.

1386
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,972
How do you two get along?

1387
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:45,708
You're not suggesting
that my son had anything

1388
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,809
to do with this?

1389
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,145
Sixteen-year-old boy,
sent off to boarding school

1390
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,413
far from home.

1391
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,182
He wouldn't be the first kid to
act out by stealing something.

1392
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:54,183
That's ridiculous.

1393
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,486
My son does not need $5,000.

1394
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,822
I've always given him
everything he wants!

1395
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:06,229
( Voice breaking )
You sure about that?

1396
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,364
Has any other money been
siphoned out of your account,

1397
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,966
business or personal?

1398
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,834
No. Why?

1399
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:16,005
A total of $30,000
was funneled through

1400
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,740
that Seattle account.

1401
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,742
Now, your son's school,
I imagine it's--

1402
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,843
it's pretty exclusive.

1403
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,945
Some of the finest families
in this country send

1404
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:23,946
their sons there.

1405
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,948
And I suppose some of
their fathers, they run

1406
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,352
companies big enough to have
permanent charities departments.

1407
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,387
I suppose so. What of it?

1408
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,257
I'll order spot audits,
see if any funds have gone

1409
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,092
unaccounted for.

1410
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:42,265
We may just be seeing
the tip of the iceberg.

1411
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:46,402
Where are you going?

1412
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,204
Seattle.

1413
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,280
Doesn't that get boring?

1414
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:59,148
No. Doesn't riding?

1415
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,183
No.

1416
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,252
Well, neither does this.

1417
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,554
Hop down, I'll show you.

1418
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,022
I don't think so.

1419
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,158
Why? I let you teach me
how to dance.

1420
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:12,762
Okay.

1421
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:29,579
You hold it vertically,
like this.

1422
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,315
It feels uncomfortable
this way.

1423
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,116
Oh, I'm sorry.

1424
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,585
You know more about this
than I do.

1425
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,253
Go ahead.

1426
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,559
Whoops!

1427
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,329
Geez, Marion,
you probably killed someone!

1428
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,065
The cops are gonna be
out here looking for suspects!

1429
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,467
Oh, a little paranoid,
are we?

1430
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,936
( Sighs )
I told you, there's

1431
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,606
nothing to worry about.

1432
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,942
Okay.

1433
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,211
So...

1434
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,480
Are you gonna come?

1435
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:05,481
To what?

1436
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,216
The archery contest.

1437
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,084
The all-comers.

1438
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,987
I'm gonna win that money
for my parents,

1439
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:15,224
put that kid in his place.

1440
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:18,628
Do you really want me to?

1441
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,929
Oh, I don't care.

1442
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:20,930
Whatever.

1443
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:24,033
Liar.

1444
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,410
We're not suggesting
your bank has done anything

1445
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,478
improper, ma'am.

1446
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,414
We'd just like your help
stopping this Mr. Johnson.

1447
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,949
Oh, my.

1448
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,017
What?

1449
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,952
Since I talked to you,
Mr. Johnson's account

1450
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,221
has been closed.

1451
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,223
What did he do
with the money?

1452
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,191
I'm not sure.

1453
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,894
Looks like some sort of
electronic transfer.

1454
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:55,264
I could try to find out where,
but it will take some time.

1455
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,899
We'd appreciate it.

1456
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,502
Here's where you can reach us.

1457
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:05,608
So... no one here
ever saw this Mr. Johnson

1458
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,009
in person?

1459
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,144
'Fraid not.

1460
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,446
Uh, his account was opened
and funded over the phone

1461
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,380
and through the mail.

1462
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,016
Mailing address was
a local p.O. Box,

1463
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,652
paid for in advance, in cash.

1464
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,322
This guy's good.

1465
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,457
The rest of the money
came from two other companies

1466
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,459
with permanent charity
departments,

1467
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,695
Gibson amalgamated steel
and Warner scientific

1468
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:29,065
industries, and guess what--
young Warner and Gibson

1469
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,067
both go to Locksley.

1470
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,169
Kind of makes you wonder
what they're teaching them

1471
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,339
out there.

1472
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,340
John: Hey, wait up!

1473
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,075
Come on, let's go! We're late!

1474
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:45,214
( Lads chuckling )
Boy: Stop it!

1475
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,283
I'm sorry,
are we bothering you?

1476
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,684
Leave me alone!

1477
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:53,322
( Bullies laughing )
Not until you pay the tax.

1478
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:55,324
Yeah, you little runt,
you gotta pay the tax.

1479
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,059
What tax?

1480
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,594
( Mockingly ) The wimp tax.

1481
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,596
Don't you guys have
anything better to do

1482
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,598
than act like jerks all day?

1483
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:03,633
Stop squirming.

1484
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,234
Hold him.

1485
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,503
Like what?

1486
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:10,473
Kick your butts
at some lame archery contest?

1487
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,975
At least that'd be
a fair fight.

1488
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:16,112
( Prince laughs )
A fair fight?

1489
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:18,381
You against me, McAllister?

1490
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,216
I wouldn't call that fair.

1491
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,518
Boy: Leave me alone.

1492
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,655
( Laughing ) A fair fight!

1493
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:26,656
Aahhh!

1494
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,392
Warner! Gibson!

1495
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:34,096
Get him! Get him!

1496
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,097
Careful!

1497
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,232
Don't wanna hurt yourselves!

1498
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,367
Get off me!

1499
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:40,303
All right!

1500
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,270
Yeah! Sweet!

1501
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,306
Now all we gotta do
is win that contest!

1502
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:44,307
If we live that long!

1503
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,177
Bad guys at ten!

1504
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,714
Gentlemen!

1505
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,549
How many times...?

1506
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:58,254
Mr. Prince, Warner, Gibson,
these men would like

1507
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,057
a word with you.

1508
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:14,537
( All panting )
John: Yes!

1509
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:19,275
Robin: Come on,
let's get outta here.

1510
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,777
I'll tell you, Warner,
if that brat of yours

1511
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,813
coerced John, Jr.,
into this scam, I'm gonna--

1512
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,815
look, don't threaten
me, prince. My son would never

1513
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:26,882
do something like this.

1514
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,151
( Prince, sr. Scoffs )
Neither would mine.

1515
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,153
Well, I can't argue
with you there, Lyle.

1516
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:37,193
Your son's too dumb to embezzle
funds by computer.

1517
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:42,164
( Nottingham clears throat )
Father. Dad.

1518
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,400
Wipe that smirk
off your face.

1519
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:47,169
Whatever you know, son,
out with it.

1520
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,606
And if you even
think
of lying,
I'll not only take you

1521
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,442
out of Locksley,
I'll shut the place down.

1522
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,212
Yes, sir.

1523
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:59,448
So I take it you're satisfied
that none of those boys

1524
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,449
is involved?

1525
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,318
Reasonably.

1526
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,719
Gum?

1527
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,856
First of all, none of them
smart enough to pull it off.

1528
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,258
And they were so scared
of their daddies, they wouldn't

1529
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,726
have lied about it if they were.

1530
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,662
For your information,
their "daddies" happen to be

1531
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,098
three of this school's
most important benefactors,

1532
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,100
and I will not have their
good names--

1533
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,702
I know, Mr. Harvey.

1534
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,304
They're all loaded,
just like the rest of

1535
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,306
the families who send
their sons here.

1536
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,742
That's why I'm convinced
this Locksley connection

1537
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,377
is no coincidence.

1538
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,379
Here's a court order
giving us full access

1539
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,381
to your files, as well as
authority to tap

1540
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:35,651
the phone lines.

1541
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,119
At Locksley?

1542
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,121
Something's going on
here, Dean.

1543
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,890
Something big.

1544
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,726
And we're gonna find out
what it is.

1545
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,729
( Comical groan )
Man. Thirty grand.

1546
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:52,902
I wish I
had
stolen
that money.

1547
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:54,403
And all by computer.

1548
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,538
That's fresh.

1549
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,706
But why'd they have to pick
our fathers' companies

1550
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,308
to steal the money from?

1551
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,310
I thought they were
going to kill us.

1552
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,746
For thirty grand,
I'd take my chances.

1553
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,347
Ohh! With the f.B.I.?

1554
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,348
With anybody.

1555
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:08,884
That's some serious money.

1556
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:09,685
The f.B.I.

1557
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,188
Thought it was
those
bozos!

1558
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,189
I love it!

1559
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,490
I don't.

1560
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,791
It's too close to the truth.

1561
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,394
Come on! The cops
are just guessing.

1562
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,396
There's no way
they can pin it on us...

1563
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,797
Is there?

1564
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,265
I don't know.

1565
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:24,567
You don't know?

1566
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,169
We are talking about
the f.B.I., man.

1567
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,671
They always get their guy.

1568
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,406
That's the mounties, dimwit.

1569
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,640
You know, like in Canada.

1570
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:35,578
Look, either they figured out
the connection with Locksley

1571
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,647
or they tracked the money
back to the local bank.

1572
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:39,949
Maybe even both.

1573
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,417
They can do that!

1574
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,418
With the banks, I mean.

1575
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,421
On that t.V. Show I saw,
the guy got around it

1576
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:50,926
by transferring his money
someplace called, uh...

1577
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,195
...the caveman islands, man.

1578
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,697
You mean the Cayman Islands.

1579
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,298
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

1580
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,300
Supposedly when you put
your money there,

1581
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,302
it's the only place
where it's completely

1582
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:01,437
untraceable.

1583
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,607
And you didn't bother
to mention this little detail?

1584
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,976
Uh... I forgot.

1585
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:13,582
Look, maybe it's
not too late. Come on.

1586
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,451
Okay, okay, relax.

1587
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,453
First I can shift
the Seattle account

1588
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,588
to the Cayman Islands,
then I can access each

1589
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,690
of the closed bank account
records and make it look like

1590
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,726
I transferred it all over
the place.

1591
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,728
I mean, I'm talking
Chicago to Phoenix,

1592
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,464
Cayman to new Mexico,
then everything will work out

1593
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,000
just the way we planned
because the Cayman island

1594
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,335
transfers are completely...

1595
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,703
All: Untraceable!

1596
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,338
Are you sure you can do that?

1597
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,740
It's worth a try.

1598
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,714
As much as it costs
to go here, I can understand

1599
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:48,384
why some kid would want
to pick up some extra cash.

1600
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,253
It's bigger than that,
seals. Much bigger than that.

1601
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,622
The more I look at it,
the more I'm convinced

1602
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,392
the thefts we've discovered
are just the tip

1603
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:59,495
of the ice... cube.

1604
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,898
Giant. I can see the tip,
but there's more...!

1605
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,033
Agent Nottingham!

1606
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:07,036
I'm picking up an outgoing call
to the Cayman Islands.

1607
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,637
Cayman Islands?

1608
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:12,942
It's a modem transmission
to a bank there.

1609
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,044
Where's it coming from?

1610
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,613
Downstairs.

1611
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,815
There. Computer lab.

1612
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:25,287
Come on!

1613
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,792
Come on, I'm trying
to send you money!

1614
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,827
What?!

1615
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,396
"Warning! Your phone line
is not secure.

1616
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,565
Please check and try again"?

1617
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:37,566
Not secure?

1618
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,434
What does that mean?

1619
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:41,537
It means someone's
listening in.

1620
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:45,908
We've got to get
out of here!

1621
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,510
Man: Computer lab's
on your right!

1622
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,511
There it is!

1623
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,448
Robin: Go, go, go, go!

1624
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:02,825
All right, mister.

1625
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,960
What do you think you're doing?

1626
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,930
My homework.

1627
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,985
( Knock on door )
Robin?

1628
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,987
Yeah?

1629
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:33,589
Are you all right?

1630
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,125
You hardly ate any
of your dinner.

1631
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,726
Guess I wasn't hungry.

1632
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,795
Well, maybe you'll feel
more like eating tomorrow

1633
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,132
when your parents get home.

1634
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,134
Did they think they'd be able
to make it to your

1635
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,136
archery tournament?

1636
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,737
They weren't sure.

1637
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,439
They said they'd try.

1638
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,474
Well, if you get hungry
later, there's leftovers

1639
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,743
in the fridge, all right?

1640
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,479
Rosie?

1641
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,648
You know what you said
when I first started Locksley,

1642
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,618
about having gifts,
and that I should use them?

1643
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:06,155
Yeah, I remember.

1644
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,891
Well...

1645
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,760
What if they didn't turn out
the way you wanted?

1646
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:14,129
What if they actually
kind of sucked?

1647
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,032
Are you in some kind
of trouble, Robbie?

1648
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,200
No.

1649
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:21,670
You see, I have this friend,
and he did what he thought

1650
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,940
was right,
something he was good at,

1651
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,644
but it didn't turn out
the way he expected.

1652
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:33,649
Tell your friend
that as long as he acted

1653
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,185
from his heart,
even if it didn't turn out

1654
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:40,656
the way he planned,
it'll be all right.

1655
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,591
People will understand.

1656
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,661
Thanks, Rosie.

1657
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,067
Gentlemen!

1658
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,769
Are we making any progress?

1659
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,804
I dearly hope that you'll be
done with this awful

1660
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:56,705
business soon!

1661
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,809
We are making progress,
Mr. Harvey.

1662
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,545
Tell me...

1663
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:06,648
What, uh, what kind of student
is Peter Grossman?

1664
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:07,649
Excellent.

1665
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,052
His two brothers
were graduated from Locksley.

1666
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:14,189
His father's income last year
was $55,000.

1667
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,558
Now, it costs, what?

1668
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:19,228
Twenty-eight-five
to go here for a full year?

1669
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,829
Give or take.

1670
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,831
Yeah. They give
and he takes.

1671
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:23,966
Mm-hmm.

1672
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,602
Well, that's cutting it
pretty close, don't you think?

1673
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,837
Boy, they must live in a tent!

1674
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:32,574
Mrs. Grossman, I believe,
has a substantial trust fund.

1675
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,110
Um... what does it matter
if Peter's a good student

1676
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,512
or not?

1677
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:40,849
Our suspect
is extremely bright.

1678
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,585
How 'bout this, uh...

1679
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,587
Robin McAllister?

1680
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:46,955
Good student?

1681
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,724
I wouldn't know.

1682
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,993
Mr. McAllister spends
most of his time in my class

1683
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,194
comatose.

1684
01:13:52,227 --> 01:14:00,269
( Nottingham laughing )
How 'bout his, uh, test scores?

1685
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,604
I.q. Tests and the like?

1686
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:03,605
Well, there is that.

1687
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,875
Yes, he
tests
very high.

1688
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,278
I see his, uh, his parents,
they won the lottery.

1689
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,279
Yeah.

1690
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,613
Twenty million, I believe.

1691
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,615
( Nottingham
whistles sharply )

1692
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:18,020
We don't really approve
of gambling here, but, um...

1693
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,889
Now, they don't--
they don't get

1694
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,659
the $20 million all at once,
do they, Mr. Harvey?

1695
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,661
I wouldn't know
about such things.

1696
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,030
Usually it's paid out
over 20 years--

1697
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:32,301
not that I'd turn it down.

1698
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,036
They bought a horse ranch.

1699
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,037
Mm-hmm.

1700
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,138
A hundred acres.

1701
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,907
( Soft chuckle )
How much something like that

1702
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,209
go for in an area like this?

1703
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,212
Five million,
easy.

1704
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:50,652
So you figure
twenty percent down payment.

1705
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:53,055
There goes the first check,
right? It's gone, isn't it?

1706
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,189
Mm-hmm.

1707
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,793
Tell me something,
Mr. Harvey,

1708
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,062
have you seen him around lately?

1709
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:03,332
No, um, as I recall,
they've been out of the country

1710
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:06,335
for the last few weeks.

1711
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,337
Out of the country?

1712
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,072
You don't say.

1713
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:15,177
Cayman Islands, by any chance,
Mr. Harvey?

1714
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:18,146
( Distant horse whinnies )
Father tuck: You're Tommy's

1715
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:27,756
Friend, from school.

1716
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:28,757
Robin McAllister.

1717
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:29,758
Robin. That's right.

1718
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,960
I was just talking to someone
from Locksley.

1719
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:35,230
Mister, uh, Mr. Harvey.

1720
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,232
He has kindly agreed
to let us have a booth

1721
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,967
at your renaissance fair.

1722
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,103
We're always looking for ways
to raise a little money,

1723
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,237
you know.

1724
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:46,375
Right.

1725
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,710
So, Robin,
what can I do for you?

1726
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:53,115
Oh, um...

1727
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:56,251
I was just wondering,
how's Tommy doing?

1728
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,320
Oh, much better.

1729
01:15:58,353 --> 01:15:59,454
Much better.

1730
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,957
In fact, they'll probably
send him home pretty soon.

1731
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,959
Once they pay the bill,
that is.

1732
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:07,095
Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

1733
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:09,097
What, paying the bill?

1734
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,732
Yeah.

1735
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,001
You see...

1736
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:16,004
My friends and I,
well, we felt sorry for Tommy,

1737
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:21,877
and... we want to do
something good, so, um,

1738
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,013
we kind of...

1739
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,149
Yes?

1740
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:31,887
We, um...

1741
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,424
We were wondering
if you still needed money.

1742
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,426
No, my son.

1743
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,162
But I'm deeply moved
by the offer.

1744
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,164
But thanks to a generous
benefactor who wishes

1745
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:45,000
to remain anonymous,
all of Tommy's medical bills

1746
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,368
will be taken care of.

1747
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,771
We are truly blessed!

1748
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:53,442
I'm truly dead.

1749
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:56,878
Agent Nottingham. F.B.I.

1750
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,447
Looking for a Robin McAllister.

1751
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,216
Wondering if he might be
somewhere nearby.

1752
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,186
Just a minute.

1753
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:05,187
Marion?

1754
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,789
Hey, Rosie, what's up?

1755
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,192
There's some men over there
who are looking for Robin,

1756
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,060
but you haven't seen him, right?

1757
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,196
No, I haven't seen him.

1758
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,198
If you happen to see him,
tell him that I meant

1759
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:19,334
what I said--
that as long as his heart

1760
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:29,411
is in the right place,
everything is going to be fine.

1761
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:38,053
Is in the right place,
everything is going to be fine.

1762
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,821
Hello? Robin?

1763
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:41,089
Marion?

1764
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:43,825
So you really think
it was the f.B.I.?

1765
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,227
I don't know.

1766
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,095
They sure looked like it.

1767
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,231
They know.

1768
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,366
I guess I'm not as smart
as I thought I was.

1769
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,969
Maybe not, but you're
probably the smartest person

1770
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:54,903
I've ever met.

1771
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,372
So how did I get myself
into this mess?

1772
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,508
Well, in your own crazy,
immature way, you were trying

1773
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,977
to do something good.

1774
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:02,978
Thanks a lot.

1775
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,012
No, I mean it.

1776
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,014
It's like what Rosie said--
if your heart was

1777
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:09,084
in the right place,
everything will be fine.

1778
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,852
People will understand.

1779
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:14,856
Yeah, well, she never met
prince's dad.

1780
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,392
What are you gonna do?

1781
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,861
I don't know.

1782
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:23,265
Be myself, I guess.

1783
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,203
( Horn blows feeble fanfare )
Barker: Come on,

1784
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,282
Don't be shy! Don't be shy!

1785
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:46,555
( Indistinct conversations )
Barker: Step right up, sir!

1786
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:51,426
( Playing medieval music )
( Shouts of approval )

1787
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:01,470
That was great.

1788
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,440
( Onlookers laughing )
It all fits.

1789
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:13,181
This, uh, Robin McAllister
must be some kind of

1790
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:14,816
computer genius.

1791
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,818
You think the parents
are in on it?

1792
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,919
Oh, they gotta be.

1793
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,589
No kid in the world
would think this up on his own.

1794
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,824
Yeah, but they just won
$20 million in the lottery.

1795
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:24,292
So they say, so they say.

1796
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:27,896
My guess is they stole
that money by computer hacking.

1797
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,932
This whole lottery story's
a front.

1798
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,934
Nah, this is a major
crime ring, seals.

1799
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,836
I can feel it right in my gut.

1800
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:41,176
( Happy chatter )
This is just like

1801
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:44,479
money in the bank!

1802
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,482
Guys. Check your watches.

1803
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,483
You all know what to do.

1804
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,484
Let's do it.

1805
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,454
Let's go. Let's do it.

1806
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:59,327
( Women laughing )
Man: That's a good idea!

1807
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,602
( Ongoing happy chatter )
( Ongoing happy chatter )

1808
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,986
Where's Robin?

1809
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,655
I can't believe he's not here.

1810
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,024
Maybe we're gonna have
to win this one for him.

1811
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:30,392
That's what you think!

1812
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,360
Robin!

1813
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,263
Shh!

1814
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,599
I don't want anybody
to know I'm here.

1815
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,134
Where's prince?

1816
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,502
I haven't seen him.

1817
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,672
It's a pleasure to see you
again, my lady.

1818
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,207
Come on!

1819
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,241
What?

1820
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:55,250
Hear ye, hear ye!

1821
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,652
Gather round,
ladies and gentlemen!

1822
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:01,156
The Locksley academy
all-comers archery tournament

1823
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,925
is about to begin!

1824
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,562
Each Archer will get
two shots from 40 feet,

1825
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:11,466
two from 60 feet,
and two from 80 feet.

1826
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:15,003
This is a winner-take-all
competition!

1827
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,305
First prize...

1828
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:20,008
One thousand dollars!

1829
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:24,045
( Shouts of approval )
Entries are now closed!

1830
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,382
Archers with the lowest scores
in each round

1831
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:31,219
will be eliminated
until we finally

1832
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:34,689
have our winner!

1833
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,591
Our first Archer is...

1834
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:41,196
Prince, Jr.:
Get out of my way!

1835
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,331
Nothing like
making an entrance.

1836
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,199
Who cares?

1837
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:47,569
It's how you leave
that's important.

1838
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:50,472
Mr. Harvey, sir.

1839
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:51,740
Are we too late?

1840
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,209
Um, as a matter of fact,
entries are...

1841
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,212
( Clears throat
ostentatiously )

1842
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,214
Is there some sort
of problem here?

1843
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:01,082
Uh, no sir, Mr. Prince.

1844
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,484
No, no problem at all.

1845
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:03,985
Add their names to the list.

1846
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,120
Get ready for the tournament.

1847
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:06,621
Disperse!

1848
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:09,090
Son, it's up to you
to make my trip out here

1849
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,192
worthwhile.

1850
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,194
Hey, isn't that
that horse I wanted you

1851
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,296
to buy me?

1852
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:17,098
Well, you'd better
win this thing, hadn't you?

1853
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,567
( Cell phone rings )
Prince, sr.: Out of my way!

1854
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,071
Hello? Yes!

1855
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,145
Gentlemen.

1856
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:33,615
Gentlemen.

1857
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:34,516
You ready?

1858
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,651
( Faint chuckle )
Mr. Harvey: Let

1859
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,753
the tournament begin!

1860
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,623
( Cheers and applause )
( Shouts of approval )

1861
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,544
Yes!

1862
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,053
( Shouts of approval )
Yes!

1863
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,568
Yes!

1864
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,303
Mr. Harvey: Excellent!

1865
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,839
That completes
the 40-foot round!

1866
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,441
The top ten archers
will continue

1867
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,710
after the targets
are moved back

1868
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,178
to the 60-foot Mark.

1869
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:39,180
Hey, thanks, Sam,
you were great.

1870
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,484
Excusez-moi, s'il vous plait.

1871
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:45,186
All clear!

1872
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:49,324
The McAllisters
just arrived.

1873
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,191
Get your men in place.

1874
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:56,197
We'll take them as soon
as this is over.

1875
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,833
Janet: Robin! Hi!

1876
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,306
Onlookers: Ohhh!

1877
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,474
Oh.

1878
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:10,412
That's okay, son!

1879
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,625
Onlookers: Ohh!

1880
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,727
( Applause )
Onlookers: Ohh!

1881
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,635
Next time. Next year.

1882
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:39,374
Win it for me, man.

1883
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,675
Concentrate.

1884
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,645
Onlookers: Ohh!

1885
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,680
You gotta do this
for us, man.

1886
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:48,650
Mr. Harvey: The final
four archers will now compete

1887
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:52,287
at a distances of 80 feet!

1888
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:56,724
All clear!

1889
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,331
( Onlookers applaud )
Onlookers: Ohh!

1890
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,312
Onlookers: Ohh!

1891
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,149
Onlookers: Ohh!

1892
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:41,202
Onlookers: Ohh! ( Applause )
That's my son.

1893
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:43,838
Yes! It's a tie!

1894
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,611
Mr. Harvey: Hear ye, hear ye!

1895
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:53,715
The final two archers
each have one shot left!

1896
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:56,718
Whoever scores higher, wins!

1897
01:25:56,751 --> 01:26:00,288
I will flip a coin
to see who goes first!

1898
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,457
Mr. Prince, you call it.

1899
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,858
Heads.

1900
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,327
Heads it is. Your choice.

1901
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,596
I'll go first.

1902
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,498
So, what do you say, hotshot?

1903
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:12,867
You up for a challenge?

1904
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,869
Why don't we move
the targets back?

1905
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,872
Say... the hundred-foot Mark?

1906
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:24,312
No problem.

1907
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:25,313
Man: All clear!

1908
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,648
Move it back!

1909
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,483
Hundred-foot Mark.

1910
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:29,484
Move it back, all the way.

1911
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,485
A hundred feet.

1912
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,688
Come on!

1913
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,761
What are you looking at
your old man for?

1914
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:41,996
I'm the guy you've got to beat.

1915
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,036
All clear.

1916
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:53,708
( Indistinct chatter )
Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

1917
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:07,355
( Onlookers react )
It's a perfect bull's-eye!

1918
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:14,929
Not bad.

1919
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:19,334
Well, I'm here,
and I'm looking at your face

1920
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:33,948
with my arrow
in the middle of the bull's-eye.

1921
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:34,949
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1922
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:37,919
Yeah, this is almost done. Yeah.

1923
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:03,945
( Cheers and applause )
( Cheers and applause )

1924
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:22,130
And the winner is...

1925
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,732
Robin McAllister!

1926
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:29,137
( Cheers and applause )
All set.

1927
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,874
Yeah, let's go.

1928
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:35,743
Congratulations, son!

1929
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,813
Oh, honey,
we're really proud of you.

1930
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:43,451
Uh... thanks, mom,
but, um, hold that thought.

1931
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:44,619
Mr. and Mrs. McAllister?

1932
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,887
Yes?

1933
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,488
Agent Walter Nottingham.

1934
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,757
F.b.i. I'd like a word
with you, please.

1935
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,159
Wait.

1936
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,827
It's me you have to talk to.

1937
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,095
You? No, no, no, no.

1938
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:57,165
I think I know who
the masterminds here are.

1939
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:58,166
No, no, no, no. Really.

1940
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:02,637
I did everything, on my own.

1941
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,573
And nobody else knows
anything about it.

1942
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:07,508
Look...

1943
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,510
I was the one that took
all the money from

1944
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:10,511
your companies.

1945
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:11,779
Not for me.

1946
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:15,016
For charity.

1947
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:18,720
For Tommy.

1948
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:20,788
He's Mr. Johnson?

1949
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:23,624
Yep.

1950
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:27,662
( Laughing )
Please!

1951
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,798
But you're--
you're only 16 years old.

1952
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:33,668
Let's go, son.

1953
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:37,672
How's your gut feel now?

1954
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,073
Yeah, but he's only 16!

1955
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,809
He's a--
he's not Mr. Johnson!

1956
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:43,077
Seals, he's only...!

1957
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,746
Okay, everybody!

1958
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:45,947
Everybody!

1959
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,916
Let's get on with the fair!

1960
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,690
Janet: Oh, Robbie!

1961
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,558
Oh, Robbie!

1962
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,827
How could you have
done this to us?

1963
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:01,929
I mean, how could you
have ruined your life?

1964
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,698
Your life? Our lives?

1965
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,099
I mean, how?

1966
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:08,236
I just wanted to do
something good for Tommy.

1967
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:10,838
You know, I know that, son,
and for that, I am

1968
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,240
very proud of you.

1969
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,708
What?!

1970
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:14,742
He stole money!

1971
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:17,111
I am not saying I'm proud
of how he did it.

1972
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:19,947
Stealing is never justified,
no matter how good the cause.

1973
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:21,215
I know.

1974
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,117
Truth is, your mother and I
could learn something from you.

1975
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:24,118
We could?

1976
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,319
Oh, come on, hon.

1977
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:27,121
Let's face it-- ever since
we won that money, we haven't

1978
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,123
been thinking about anything
except ourselves

1979
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,224
and what
we
wanted.

1980
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:34,595
I guess you could say
we have been... a little...

1981
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:35,663
Preoccupied.

1982
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:37,532
Oh, we sure have.

1983
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:40,067
You know, the truth is,
I think Robin did it

1984
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,969
just to get our attention.

1985
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:46,974
No, I did it 'cause I thought
it'd be cool.

1986
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,609
But I was wrong, and...

1987
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:49,744
I see that now.

1988
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,146
Anyway, I am gonna make sure
that that family gets

1989
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:54,148
enough money till they get
back on their feet.

1990
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,884
Oh.

1991
01:30:56,918 --> 01:31:02,590
Well, dad,
you kind of already helped.

1992
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,225
But we'll talk about that later.

1993
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:05,226
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1994
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:06,227
Okay, fine, fine.

1995
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,996
I get the picture.

1996
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:14,268
( Sighs )
My overpriced attorney

1997
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,270
has just pointed out
how it's going to look

1998
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,272
if we choose to prosecute
a 16-year-old boy for stealing

1999
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,741
a piddling amount of money
to pay some poor kid's

2000
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:22,143
hospital bill.

2001
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:25,746
I'd hardly call $30,000
a piddling amount.

2002
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,216
It's not the money,
it' the principle.

2003
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:30,017
Who cares about he principle?

2004
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,154
It's the public relations!

2005
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:35,756
So guess what--
not only am I not

2006
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,759
going to press charges,
but from now on,

2007
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,162
prince enterprises
is going to include

2008
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:43,731
St. ignacios parish
on its list of

2009
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:46,634
permanent charities,
and if I'm gonna do that,

2010
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,036
so are both of you.

2011
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,640
( Telephones ringing )
Warner. Prince.

2012
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:53,641
Gibson.

2013
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:54,709
Just a minute. Hold on.

2014
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:57,578
All: It's for you.

2015
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:06,287
Marion: Hi.

2016
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,688
Hey.

2017
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:09,657
How's it going?

2018
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:12,360
Well, I've almost got
the church's finances

2019
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:14,795
pulled up to the 20th century.

2020
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:16,797
Just in time for
the 21st?

2021
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,800
Yeah. Don't tell nobody,
but, as far as this

2022
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:23,170
punishment thing goes,
it's actually kind of fun.

2023
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,840
I was wondering,
you want to go to

2024
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:26,908
a movie tonight?

2025
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,876
I can't. Part of my
probation's that I've got

2026
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:29,944
to be in before dark.

2027
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:32,680
What about a matinee
Saturday?

2028
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:34,682
Got community service
all day Saturday.

2029
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:37,818
Okay, let's make this easy--
what can you do,

2030
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:41,255
and when can you do it.

2031
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:51,232
Well, I'm free on sunday--
after church, that is.

2032
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,867
What was that for?

2033
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,969
For being you.

2034
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:56,971
( Faint chuckle )
Come on.

2035
01:32:57,004 --> 01:33:00,074
I want to show you something.

2036
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,716
What's this?

2037
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,385
Sherwood archery club,
youth division.

2038
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,121
The most important thing
about archery is that you're

2039
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:16,857
completely relaxed
at the time that you fire.

2040
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:20,428
The bow is stretched,
there's tension in the string,

2041
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:24,632
but you are totally at ease.

2042
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:31,939
Would you quit blabbing
and let the kid shoot?

2043
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,107
Bravo, Tommy! Not bad.

2044
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,776
I did it, I did it!

2045
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,045
This archery's
a good thing for these kids.

2046
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:40,314
Teaches them discipline,
concentration.

2047
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,350
Next year we should have
our own faire, with our own

2048
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:43,818
archery contest.

2049
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,219
Sounds good to me.

2050
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:47,221
Maybe we can get that
Mr. Johnson to put up

2051
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,090
the prize money.

2052
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,025
Oh, wait a minute.

2053
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:53,194
Don't look at me 'cause,
you know, I'm through with that.

2054
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:54,095
That's it.

2055
01:33:54,128 --> 01:34:03,037
( Marion and father tuck
laughing )

2056
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,172
