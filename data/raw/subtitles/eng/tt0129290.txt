You've been accused of
practicing medicine without a license.

1513
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,840
That's a very
grave charge, son.

1514
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:05,320
Are you aware that it's unlawful
to practice medicine without
a medical license ?

1515
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,000
Yes, sir, I am.

1516
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,720
Are you aware that running a medical
clinic without the proper licensing...

1517
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,960
can place both you
and the public...

1518

in a great deal of danger ?

1519
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,000
Is a home a clinic, sir ?

1520

If you are admitting patients
and treating them...

1521
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,520

is irrelevant.

Sir, will you define
treatment for me ?

1523

Yes. Treatment would be defined
as the care of a patient
seeking medical attention.

been treating patients at your ranch ?

of some form of physical
or mental help.

1535
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,520
They're patients.

1536
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,720
But also every person who comes
to the ranch is in charge of
taking care of someone else--

whether it's cooking for them,
cleaning them...

1538

or even as simple a task
as listening.

1539

That makes them doctors.

1540
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:25,600
I use that term broadly, but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else ?

1541
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:29,600
When did the term "doctor" get
treated with such reverence, as,
"Right this way, Doctor Smith"...

or, "Excuse me, Dr. Scholl,
what wonderful footpads"...

At what point in history
did a doctor become more...

01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,280
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill ?

Now, you ask me if
I've been practicing medicine.

Well, if this means opening
your door to those in need--

caring for them, listening
to them, applying a cold cloth
until a fever breaks--

1551
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,280
if this is practicing medicine,
if this is treating a patient...

1552

then I am guilty
as charged, sir.

1553

Did you consider the ramifications
of your actions ?

What if one of your patients
had died ?

What's wrong
with death, sir ?

What are we so mortally
afraid of ?

1557
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,560
Why can't we treat death with
a certain amount of humanity
and dignity and decency...

Death is not the enemy,

let's fight one of the most

Now, I've sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference...

is inevitable, sir.

Every human being
has an impact on another.

Why don't we want that in
a patient/doctor relationship ?

1567
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:46,400
That's why I've listened to your
teachings, and I believe they're wrong.

1568

A doctor's mission should be
not just to prevent death...

but also to improve
the quality of life.

still be viewed as a thorn.

01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,280
And no one's gonna bend
or break me

1667
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,440
I can reach any star

1668
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:23,560
-  I've got faith
-  I've got, I've got faith

1669
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,760
I've got faith

1670
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,560
Faith of the heart

1671
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,320
It's been a long night

1672
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:42,320
Trying to find my way

1673
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,160
Been through the darkness

1674
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:49,480
Now I finally have my day

1675
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:53,840
And I will see my dream
come alive at last

1676
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,120
I will touch the sky

1677
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:01,000
And they're not gonna
hold me down no more

1678
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:04,240
No, they're not gonna
change my mind

1679
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:08,760
'Cause I've got faith
of the heart

1680
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:11,680
I'm going where my heart
will take me

1681
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:16,040
I've got faith to believe

1682
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:19,200
I can do anything

1683
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,400
I've got strength
of the soul

1684
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,480
And no one's gonna bend
or break me

1685
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,560
I can reach any star

1686
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:35,880
-  I've got faith
-  I've got, I've got faith

1687
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,800
Faith of the heart

1688
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,120
I've known a wind so cold

1689
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:47,080
I've seen the darkest days

1690
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:51,440
But now the winds I feel

1691
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,360
Are only winds of change

1692
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,880
I've been through the fire

1693
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,720
And I've been through
the rain

1694
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,000
But I'll be fine

1695
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,680
-  Oh, yeah
-  'Cause I got faith

1696
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,960
Of the heart

1697
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:12,800
I'm going where my heart
will take me

1698
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:17,200
I've got faith to believe

1699
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,040
I can do anything

1700
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,240
I've got strength
of the soul

1701
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,520
And no one's gonna bend
or break me

1702
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,320
I can reach any star

1703
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:35,040
-  I got, I got, I got
-  I've got faith

1704
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:39,520
-  Faith of the
-  Faith of the heart

1705
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,200
I'm going where my heart
will take me

1706
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:46,520
I've got faith to believe

1707

And no one's gonna bend
or break me

01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:53,720
I can reach any star

1709
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:58,880
-  'Cause I've got faith
-  I've got, I've got, I've got

1710
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,280
'Cause I've got faith

1711
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:06,440
Faith of the heart

1712
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:15,400
It's been a long road
