1
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,738
<i>This then? This is a not a movie</i>

2
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:43,403
<i>This is a libel, slander,
defamation of character</i>

3
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:44,890
<i>A prolonged insult </i>

4
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,566
<i>A godless spit in the face of art</i>

5
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:50,823
<i>A kick in the pants to God,
man, destiny, </i>

6
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:54,017
<i>time, love, beauty,
what you will.</i>

7
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,482
<i>I'm going to sing for you</i>

8
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:57,783
<i>A little off-key, perhaps,
but I will sing </i>

9
00:00:57,903 --> 00:00:59,485
<i>I will sing while you croak</i>

10
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,102
<i>I will dance over
your dirty corpse.</i>

11
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,335
Have you seen Boris?

12
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,547
He's meeting someone who
may rent the apartment

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,649
Could you loan me 5 Francs to
take a taxi to Saint Lazare?

14
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,858
Now, you know Mona. If I'm not
there to meet the boat train

15
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,827
she's allowed to turn right
'round and go back

16
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:16,974
Oh, Henry!

17
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,093
Ok, it's too late already, forget it

18
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,888
Oh, for god's sake, here

19
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:26,847
<i>She rises up out of a sea of
faces and embraces me</i>

20
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,785
<i>embraces me, passionately</i>

21
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:32,330
<i>A thousand eyes, noses,
fingers, legs </i>

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,632
<i>bottles, windows, purses,
saucers all glaring at us </i>

23
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:39,414
<i>And we in each other's
arms, oblivious. </i>

24
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:43,414
<i>I sit down beside her, and she
talks, a flood of talk </i>

25
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,844
<i>Wild, consumptive
notes of hysteria </i>

26
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,730
<i>Perversion, leprosy.</i>

27
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,305
<i>I hear not a word, because she's
beautiful and I love her. </i>

28
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,353
<i>And now I'm happy
and willing to die. </i>

29
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:04,957
The hotel, where is it?

30
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,893
Can we go to the hotel right now?

31
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,888
Nah, I've gotta find Boris

32
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,068
I thought I'd never get here

33
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:16,298
When you weren't at the station, I...

34
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:24,472
Hey! Boris!

35
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:26,414
Henry, how are you? Nice to see you

36
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,278
Hey, glad to see you!

37
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,186
Here's Mona, my wife

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,605
Hello

39
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,525
Oh no

40
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:37,444
My cheque didn't come, I haven't got it

41
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:38,547
20 francs?!

42
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,971
It's all I've got, it's
all I got on me, fella!

43
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,451
Here, I'll give you half what I got.
Go on

44
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,330
Come on, Boris

45
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,508
Just...just once?

46
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:50,866
Ah, alright

47
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,185
Take it

48
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,077
-Thanks
-Yeah

49
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,442
-Really appreciate it.
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

50
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:58,620
-Thanks a lot!
-Yeah, yeah, sure, swell.

51
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,849
Oh, yeah. A pleasure.

52
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,490
- I see you Boris.
-So long, Henry!

53
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,900
May I take my dress off?

54
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,219
No

55
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,147
Oh, I forgot to tell you

56
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,332
I had a, um...

57
00:03:57,452 --> 00:04:00,423
...reading for a play, just before
I left New York

58
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,306
It was for Charlie Morton's new play

59
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,546
<i>He</i> liked me, he really did

60
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:11,094
But, of course, they gave the part
to the producer's new girlfriend

61
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:12,454
They're idiots

62
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,383
Anyway, this...

63
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:22,324
...you know, she's probably gonna
have to wear a wig

64
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,568
Or if they try to colour that hair
one more time, it'll turn green

65
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,237
I need a Kleenex

66
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,657
You have a Kleenex? No, you don't
have a Kleenex

67
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:36,871
What do you ask for in French, I don't
know what to ask. Well, I guess Kleenex

68
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,353
They always understand Coca-Cola

69
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:59,431
-Baby?
-Hm?

70
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,943
-I don't wanna alarm you, but...

71
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:04,569
-You're covered with bugs
-What!!

72
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:09,619
You bastard!!

73
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:03,570
Deux café, s'il vous plaît

74
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,284
It's out of order and it stinks

75
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,400
I must have a bath

76
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,614
I've <i>got</i> to have a bath

77
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:26,087
It's a little bit cold

78
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,266
Get my clothes hung up

79
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:34,113
Get 'em pressed. Look at
the state they're in

80
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:38,320
We look like a couple of tramps

81
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:44,120
We must find another hotel.
And a clean one

82
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,320
I want to find a <i>good</i> hotel
as soon as they're open.

83
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,084
-What time are they open around
here, anyway? -Seven or eight.

84
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:55,482
How much money have you got left?

85
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,334
What the hell are you doing? You trying
to get us thrown out of here?

86
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:14,306
Thank you, tres bien, merci.

87
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,357
Wait, I have to take a bath.

88
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:22,248
Wait.

89
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:58,561
-Oh yeah.
-Uh uh! Your bath is running.

90
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,384
Isn't it good to be clean again?

91
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,495
How much money have you got left?

92
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,959
Oh, I've got enough for tonight.

93
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,712
Oh no!

94
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:27,571
Uh uh, no.

95
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,003
Oh, no.

96
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:02,674
<i>When I realise that she's gone,
perhaps gone forever </i>

97
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:08,130
<i> a great void opens up, and I feel that
I'm falling into deep, black space </i>

98
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,895
<i>And this is worse than tears, deeper
than regret, or pain, sorrow</i>

99
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:18,305
<i>It is the abyss into which Satan
was plunged.</i>

100
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,639
<i>There's no climbing back,
no ray of light</i>

101
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,730
<i>no sound or human voice,
or human touch of hand</i>

102
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,115
<i>How many thousand times walking
through the streets at night </i>

103
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,740
have I wondered if a day would
ever come again

104
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,013
<i>when she would be at my side?</i>

105
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:37,760
<i>All those yearning looks I bestowed
on the buildings and statues </i>

106
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,573
<i>I'd looked at them so hungrily,
so desperately, that by now </i>

107
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:45,120
<i>my thoughts must've become a part
of the very buildings and statues.</i>

108
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,972
<i>They must be saturated
with my anguish.</i>

109
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:52,414
<i>I could not help but reflect, also, that
when we'd walked side by side</i>

110
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:56,580
<i>through these mournful dingy streets now
saturated with my dream and longing</i>

111
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,807
<i>that she's observed
nothing, felt nothing.</i>

112
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:03,408
<i>They were like any streets to her, a little
more sordid, perhaps, and that is all.</i>

113
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,891
<i>I became reconciled to this life
without her </i>

114
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:08,427
<i>and yet if I thought about
her only for a minute</i>

115
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:11,885
<i>it was enough to pierce the bone and
marrow of my contentment</i>

116
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,015
<i>and shove me back again</i>

117
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:18,081
<i>into the agonising gutter of
my wretched past.</i>

118
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,669
<i>Somehow...</i>

119
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,682
<i>...the realisation that
nothing was to be hoped for </i>

120
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:26,434
<i>had a salutary effect on me</i>

121
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,307
<i>And then it occurred
to me, like a flash,</i>

122
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:33,541
<i>that no-one would refuse a man a meal
if only he had the courage to demand it.</i>

123
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:36,482
<i>I went immediately to a café and
wrote a dozen letters </i>

124
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,948
"Would you let me have dinner
with you once a week?"

125
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:43,250
<i>"Tell me what day is most
convenient for you."</i>

126
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,122
<i>It worked like a charm!
I was not only fed, I was feasted.</i>

127
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,647
<i>Every night I went home drunk.</i>

128
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:57,899
<i>And now I could afford to scratch
off the ones who were a pain the ass.</i>

129
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,082
You see? I calculated your share of
the actual cost of last Tuesday's meal.

130
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,919
Not counting the half bottle of
wine you knocked off the table.

131
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,270
-Won't you be late for class?
-It comes to 12 francs, 63 centimes.

132
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,186
-bringing the total to 1,340.01 exactly.

133
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:19,396
-We're not asking him to pay us back.
-I know, I know, but it's just very interesting!

134
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,027
Hey!

135
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,540
Hi, come on in!

136
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:02,824
<i>One by one I fucked myself out
of all those free dinners</i>

137
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,551
<i>The wives turned against me</i>

138
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,093
<i>Or the husbands.</i>

139
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:34,089
Tania, darling? When's dinner?

140
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,687
I'm just finishing my practise, darling.

141
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,843
We'll have to stop this now,
he's home again.

142
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:06,982
-Darling, I think the potatoes are burning.
-I'll be there in just a second, darling!

143
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:15,840
Ah, there we are, darlings

144
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:21,058
Now, give Henry a large helping,
Sylvester, he's building up

145
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:34,410
-How was New York?
-Oh, terrible

146
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,550
New York is dreadful, you know that

147
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,329
All those phonies

148
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,274
But we're set for a February opening

149
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,496
And Craig St.Que will direct

150
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,642
It's good. Jolly good

151
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:51,761
What's next?

152
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,290
Well, there's a work-in-progress,
naturally

153
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,926
I like to call it that

154
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,985
You know, if he finishes a
play in the morning

155
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,049
and there's still an hour or
two before lunch

156
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,689
He puts a new sheet of paper
in the typewriter

157
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,273
and starts right off on a new one

158
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:07,714
That's how to be a writer

159
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,719
More Henry, or you've had enough?

160
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,527
I think I can take a little more

161
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,966
Give Henry some more, Sylvester

162
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,132
But, you know, he's fantastic!

163
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:20,546
He never talks about it

164
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:25,166
But when he sits down to write,
it just rolls out of him

165
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:26,977
I believe it

166
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,467
<i>You smile at me so confidently,
so calculatingly</i>

167
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:35,407
<i>I'm flattering the ass off you,
can't you tell?</i>

168
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:36,937
And I believe...

169
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:39,182
...this wine is corky

170
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,967
I thought that was only supposed
to happen in the States

171
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:46,594
<i>While I listen to your crap,
she's got her hand on me</i>

172
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:48,641
<i>But you don't see that</i>

173
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,648
Yeah, it's in the kichen.

174
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:54,952
Henry? Why don't you nip out, and bring
in a couple of bottles, huh?

175
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:56,872
It's on the top...

176
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,666
...shelf

177
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,383
Henry, you fool

178
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,841
So now I'm the only one left who'll
cough up the weekly dinner

179
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,350
Two cognacs, please

180
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,499
Yeah, well, uh...

181
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:25,261
I didn't know Sylvester was
so hyper-sensitive

182
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,797
Ah, Tania!

183
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,003
It was worth it!

184
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:33,555
-So, what're you gonna do now?
-Jeez, I don't know

185
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,370
Yeah, that's Fillmore

186
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:41,732
-Maybe <i>he's</i> got a spare bed
-Doesn't look like it tonight

187
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,734
Princess, princess, don't be mad

188
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,560
I won't move my hips anymore

189
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,222
You speak too much. Too loud

190
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,517
And you speak nonsense!

191
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,163
My nervous, my nervous!

192
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:34,422
Please give me some champagne

193
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:37,209
It's the only thing for my temperament

194
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,029
A champagne, please

195
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:42,864
Oh, hi Joe, hi Joe

196
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,155
-Hi Joe

197
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,642
-Fellas?

198
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:48,105
I want you to meet the Princess Macha

199
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,142
She's royal, you know

200
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:54,807
Fillmore? Can I use your sofa tonight?

201
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:58,727
No, you cannot use the sofa tonight

202
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:02,301
What are you whispering for?

203
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,574
You want me not to hear?

204
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,212
Why should your friend not sleep
at your apartment tonight?

205
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,341
The poor fellow

206
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:16,459
You think he gets me there
to make love?

207
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,790
I don't blame you

208
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,401
You should see me when
I'm undressed

209
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:25,234
I'm very beautiful

210
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,456
But a princess of the blood royale
is not to be bought

211
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:35,048
for a few miserable bottles
of champagne

212
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:36,968
-And the caviar
-Oh la la

213
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:51,937
It's, uh...the royal temperament, huh?

214
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:09,882
But you won't enjoy it

215
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:11,603
I warn you

216
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,314
Oh, Princess

217
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,170
You let me be the judge of that, huh?

218
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:20,974
Alright

219
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,865
Princess

220
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,821
Did I tell you I have the clap?

221
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:34,501
The clap?!

222
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,612
And what are you making
a fuss for?

223
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,283
It's only gonorrhoea

224
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:39,707
-Only gonorrhoea?!

225
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,831
Oh, Americans

226
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,359
They have no manners at all!

227
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,226
What's that?

228
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:52,434
It's me, Henry

229
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,329
Joe from the bar

230
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,684
Joe from the bar

231
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,198
These blankets are no good.
I'm so cold

232
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,839
Come here and warm me a little

233
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,928
Right away, your Highness

234
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:13,926
I wouldn't, if I were you

235
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:18,477
-You didn't give her a key, did you?
-Yes

236
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,059
-Alright

237
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:27,884
You poor shy boys

238
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,243
I go to take a little coffee now

239
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,698
So, you can get dressed

240
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:37,232
Money!

241
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:41,598
Just a little 10 franc note

242
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,696
I see you later

243
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:45,294
But...

244
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:48,760
...what a charming place you have

245
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,891
I'm going to like it here

246
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,919
Bye bye

247
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,680
You grab the door

248
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:02,183
I'm going to get the lock changed

249
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,486
Peckover! You live around here?

250
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,067
No, I work days, too

251
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,424
Didn't you know?

252
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,340
Dentist office up the street

253
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,769
To pay off this set of teeth
they made for me

254
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:37,083
Hey, don't you read proof
the paper anymore?

255
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,686
Why? What have you heard?

256
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:40,823
About what?

257
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,880
Well, I know you're hanging around
with Carl and Van Norden

258
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,990
Did they say anything?

259
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,671
They didn't say anything

260
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:55,574
That boss of mine

261
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:58,623
He balls the piss out of me
if I miss a semi-colon

262
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:04,470
Yeah? Maybe he needs more help

263
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,233
I'm a great semi-colon spotter

264
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,664
Well, uh, is there a list I
can put my name on?

265
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,835
For future consideration

266
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:16,284
Yeah, put it on there

267
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:18,756
I'll see it gets on
the applications list

268
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:19,922
Thanks

269
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,298
Thanks a lot

270
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,867
Well, here...

271
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,804
...take a look at these ads, maybe you'll
find something good on there

272
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,205
If you do, you'll be way ahead
of everybody else in Paris

273
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:42,149
Hey. How about this one?

274
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:44,746
American needed for teaching in Dijon

275
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,086
under international exchange agreement

276
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:48,620
Room and board

277
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,319
What's the salary?

278
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,736
There's no mention of money. It's, uh...

279
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:55,832
"Your contribution to Franco-
American amity."

280
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:58,344
It's a roof over the head, and food

281
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,891
Bon Soir, Monsieur. Je suis
le professor American

282
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:10,744
Entrer

283
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:16,802
Oh, brother!

284
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,170
Good night, Monsieur Miller

285
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:26,970
Ah, good night, Monsieur Le Censeur

286
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:30,939
Pray, consider yourself welcomed
among our walls.

287
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:36,087
I observe you're astounded,
to be listen of English spoke

288
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:40,588
It is myself that have 'til now instruct
the pupils in this language

289
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:44,432
But a man occupied as myself
have no more for such

290
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:49,188
You, Monsieur Miller, henceforth shall talk
the English conversation to the boys

291
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,633
I, uh, my best will do to follow up
your good work

292
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,036
Monsieur Le Censeur

293
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:58,802
It is a class in the morning

294
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,515
at eight of the clock

295
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:04,503
You are speaking French, I hope?

296
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:07,468
Well, a little. Un tout petit peu

297
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,808
Un tout petit peu

298
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,085
Un tout petit peu

299
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:11,702
Peu

300
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:12,570
Peu

301
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,547
Excellent

302
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:17,290
Your predecessor was not gifted
with the tongue

303
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:20,383
He was not capable to follow my work

304
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:24,483
Also he did not exercise himself to...

305
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,379
...inform us about his departure

306
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,578
He go, uh...

307
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,280
...over the wall

308
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,073
Couldn't he have just gone
through the door?

309
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,199
The door is locked by key

310
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,679
Each night, at ten

311
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:40,558
To avoid the infiltration of women

312
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:44,040
A contingency at all costs
to be avoided

313
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:45,559
Exactement

314
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,633
Now, back to our businesses

315
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:07,105
Thus, your personal fire for a week

316
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:12,130
Also, there is in supplementation
two measures of coal, in bucket

317
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,307
Paper must by yourself be found

318
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:16,742
I for it will start looking at once

319
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:22,153
Yes. In times you do not converse with
the boys, you are at liberty

320
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:25,152
The town of Dijon is yours

321
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:27,091
Amuse yourself goodly

322
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,668
A tout alors, Monsieur Miller

323
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:34,662
Your continuing good health,
Monsieur Le Censeur

324
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,075
<i>Oh, Tania...</i>

325
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:18,866
<i>Where now is that
warm cunt of yours?</i>

326
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:23,306
<i>Those fat heavy garters,
those soft bulging thighs</i>

327
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:27,909
<i>There's a bone in my prick,
six inches long</i>

328
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,890
<i>Hell, I'll ream out every wrinkle
in your cunt, Tania</i>

329
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,375
<i>Big with seed, I'll send you home
to your Sylvester </i>

330
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:37,527
<i>with an ache in your belly and
your womb turned inside out</i>

331
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,451
<i>Your Sylvester, yes he knows
how to build a fire</i>

332
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,826
<i>but I know how to inflame a cunt</i>

333
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,446
<i>Tania, I make your ovaries
incandescent</i>

334
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:50,728
<i>Sylvester's a little jealous now.
He feels something</i>

335
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,674
<i>He feels the remnants
of my big prick</i>

336
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:00,405
<i>But I've set the
shores a little wider</i>

337
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,719
<i>Ironed out the wrinkles</i>

338
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,612
<i>After me you can
take on stallions</i>

339
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:09,968
<i>Bulls, rams, drakes, St. Bernards</i>

340
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:12,857
<i>You can stuff toads, bats,
lizards up your rectum </i>

341
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:15,039
<i>You can shit
arpeggios if you like</i>

342
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,934
<i>Or string a zither
across your navel</i>

343
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:22,513
<i>I am fucking you, Tania, so
that you'll stay fucked</i>

344
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:26,573
<i>And if you're afraid of being fucked
publicly, I'll fuck you privately</i>

345
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:29,038
<i>I'll tear off a few
hairs from your cunt </i>

346
00:26:29,158 --> 00:26:31,376
<i>and paste them on Boris's chin</i>

347
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:35,324
<i>I will bite into your clitoris and
spit out two franc pieces.</i>

348
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:38,038
Good morning, boys, I'm
your new professor

349
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:40,526
Good morning, Monsieur Professor

350
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,708
Now what shall we talk about?

351
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,810
Anybody have anything they
want to talk about?

352
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:55,225
<i>Poor kids!</i>

353
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,450
Our first subject is
the physiology of...

354
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,150
Love

355
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:12,443
Let's consider how the
elephants make love

356
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:15,667
Pachyderms

357
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:19,215
Although they're pretty heavily built

358
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:22,104
They get pretty spry when a
male gets a bone on

359
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:23,053
A bone?

360
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:27,650
Uh, some animals have
bones in their penis

361
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:32,840
Hence this expression...

362
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:36,305
A...bone...on.

363
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,319
Now, happily, according to Gourmont

364
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,677
This bony structure is lost in man

365
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,361
Now, think

366
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,398
what would happen if you had

367
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:51,878
half the human race walking
around with a bone on

368
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,082
-Good morning, boys

369
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:21,782
-Good morning, Monsieur Professor

370
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:23,576
Right. Sit down

371
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,113
Today, we agreed, was "question day"

372
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:30,789
Fire away, ask anything at all

373
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:35,754
We'll answer all questions,
but one at a time

374
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,481
Yesterday, you was telling us
about the whale

375
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,830
Yeah.

376
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,417
This noble beast

377
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:45,510
Has a penis two metres long

378
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:52,257
That's quite true my boy, and
that's only in repose

379
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:55,228
And the kangaroo have two?

380
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:57,442
That's quite right.

381
00:28:58,412 --> 00:29:00,206
It's a double penis

382
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,238
It's one for weekdays and
one for Sundays

383
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:53,297
<i>Music was the least of my worries</i>

384
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>I didn't even think of cunt</i>

385
00:29:55,443 --> 00:30:00,389
<i>so dismal, so chill,
so barren, so grey was it all</i>

386
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,855
Un telegram, Monsieur

387
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:05,668
<i>Paris</i>

388
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:10,196
<i> Indian pearl merchant wants lowlife
guide to Paris. Stop. </i>

389
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,587
How about it, Fillmore!

390
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:15,867
When's the next train to Paris?

391
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,608
-Monsieur?
-Le prochain train, oh never mind

392
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:20,475
Merci, merci

393
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:37,703
No, he go...over the wall

394
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:40,992
In the fullness of night he disappeared

395
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,190
Fillmore, my all, my saviour

396
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,328
Get in here and sit down

397
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:58,290
Well, where's the pearl merchant?

398
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:00,492
Am I ready to take him to the haunts

399
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,332
of coot, fern, and fornication?

400
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:05,139
Well, it's not the old merchant himself

401
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,532
It's his only nephew

402
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:08,387
What's he looking for in Paris?

403
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:11,477
Well as far as I can tell,
his wants are simple

404
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:14,949
Don't you worry though, the old boy's
paying for his "education"

405
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:18,651
For God's sake, Ranjid, you can't
jump them in the street.

406
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,145
Let's wait 'til we get to Miss Hamilton

407
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,373
This is it, let me tell you

408
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:26,648
this is really a refined,
high-class joint

409
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,001
Hello, baby

410
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,371
Hello?

411
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:42,745
Take your pick, you get your choice

412
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:49,401
You'll feel better when
you've had a drink

413
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,256
Ladies?

414
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:59,078
I'll take this one

415
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:06,983
You have good taste, Monsieur

416
00:33:07,103 --> 00:33:09,598
I am sure you will be very
happy together

417
00:33:13,987 --> 00:33:15,080
What?

418
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,117
No, you can't, they'll be offended

419
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:21,064
If you wish.

420
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,640
-Let us have rooms next door, huh?
-If you must

421
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,058
Yes?!

422
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,521
Henry?

423
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,430
The young lady has gone for her toilet

424
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:54,487
but where can I go?

425
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:55,764
Quick, quick!

426
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:57,862
Tell me before she comes back!

427
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,742
Use the bidet, for Christ's sake!

428
00:34:02,054 --> 00:34:03,230
Thank you!

429
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:17,897
Oh Madam, I do beg of you

430
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,106
Have you no shame?

431
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,843
You are responsible, to bring
a savage to Miss Hamilton!

432
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:25,489
One of the most distinguished
bordel of Paris

433
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,441
Hey man, what'd you do?

434
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,776
What did he do?!

435
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:37,362
Honey, I show you what he do.
Come with me!

436
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,692
Voila! Régal your eyes on that!

437
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,242
Oh, brother

438
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,121
You shouldn't have told me to

439
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:48,416
I didn't know it wouldn't go down

440
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,579
I asked you where to go and
you told me to use that

441
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,485
Come along. Let us get out of here

442
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:56,381
For the femme de chambre

443
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,635
I would like to get out of here

444
00:35:01,493 --> 00:35:03,631
Would you like to try another place?

445
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:06,284
Oh, no, no.

446
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:14,620
<i>For some reason or other, man
looks for the miracle</i>

447
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,608
<i>And to accomplish it he
will wade through blood</i>

448
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:20,183
<i>He will debauch himself with ideas</i>

449
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:22,408
<i>he will reduce himself to a shadow</i>

450
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:25,451
<i>If only for one second of his life
he can close his eyes</i>

451
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:28,216
<i>to the hideousness of reality</i>

452
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:31,290
<i>Everything is endured</i>

453
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,863
<i>Disgrace, humiliation</i>

454
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:37,146
<i>Poverty, war, crime, ennui</i>

455
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,057
<i>And the belief that, overnight</i>

456
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:41,142
<i>something will occur</i>

457
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:45,413
<i>A miracle which will render
life tolerable</i>

458
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:58,774
<i>So I think what a miracle it would
be if at the last moment</i>

459
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:02,404
<i>when the banquet table is set,
and the cymbals clash</i>

460
00:36:02,524 --> 00:36:05,558
<i>there should appear, suddenly,
and wholly without warning</i>

461
00:36:05,678 --> 00:36:08,828
<i>a silver platter, on which even
the blind could see</i>

462
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,842
<i>that there's nothing more
and nothing less</i>

463
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:14,834
<i>than two enormous lumps of shit</i>

464
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:23,976
<i>When I look down into this
fucked-out cunt of a whore</i>

465
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,760
<i>I feel the whole world beneath me</i>

466
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,943
<i> a world tottering and crumbling</i>

467
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,283
<i> A world used up and polished</i>

468
00:36:30,403 --> 00:36:32,407
<i>like a leper's skull</i>

469
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:36,434
<i>If there were a man who dared to say
all that he thought of this world</i>

470
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:40,433
<i>There would not be left him a square
foot of ground to stand on</i>

471
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:42,434
<i>When a man appears </i>

472
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:45,748
<i>the world bears down on him
and breaks his back</i>

473
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:48,747
<i>There are always too many rotten
pillars left standing </i>

474
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:50,828
<i>for man to bloom</i>

475
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:54,000
<i>The superstructure is a lie</i>

476
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:58,473
<i>And the foundation is a
huge, quaking fear</i>

477
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:01,460
<i>And if at intervals of centuries</i>

478
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,621
<i>there does appear a man with a
desperate, hungry look in his eyes</i>

479
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:08,113
<i>A man who would turn the
world upside down </i>

480
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,852
<i>in order to create a new race</i>

481
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:15,220
<i>The love that he brings to the
world is turned to bile.</i>

482
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:20,609
Wait, wait! I found them,
I found them!

483
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,980
What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?

484
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,167
Stupid bastards wouldn't stop. Look.

485
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,175
Poor old Peckover fell down
the elevator shaft

486
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:30,326
Eight storeys

487
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:34,087
They found him crawling around,
crying, looking for these

488
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:35,973
He couldn't think about anything else

489
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:38,119
He hasn't finished paying for them yet

490
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:41,660
And they're quarrelling about who's
going to write the obituary

491
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:46,008
I think you're next in line for his job!

492
00:37:48,874 --> 00:37:50,565
Hey hey, get up here!

493
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,435
-What's all this? -Don't worry,
my dear, they're friends of mine

494
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,670
First paycheck in four months

495
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:08,549
Here's to Peckover, he'd
have liked this

496
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:12,474
Thanks to us, he died
with his teeth in

497
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,111
To Peckover

498
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,074
To Peckover

499
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,876
Now, let's have another bottle of wine!

500
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:25,022
Oh no! Look at my dress, you stupid

501
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:31,985
Now you know not to laugh
at French women!

502
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:35,508
Spirited girl

503
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:36,845
Yeah

504
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,760
I'd better follow her

505
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:42,755
But why?

506
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,893
Because I gave her the key
to my place, that's why

507
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:48,668
And if I don't apologise

508
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,958
she'll be waiting with a broken bottle

509
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,587
See you later, Joe

510
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,531
You know what I love most about Fillmore?

511
00:38:57,651 --> 00:39:00,874
His absolute refusal
to learn from experience

512
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:07,720
<i>Llona, now, she had a cunt</i>

513
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:11,761
<i>I know because she sent us
some hairs from down below</i>

514
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:13,232
<i>Llona</i>

515
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:16,603
<i>a wild ass snuffing pleasure
out of the wind</i>

516
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:19,518
<i>On every high hill, she
played the harlot</i>

517
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:23,622
<i>And sometimes in telephone
booths, and toilets</i>

518
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:25,640
<i>She used candles</i>

519
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,304
<i>Roman candles and doorknobs</i>

520
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:32,345
<i>Not a prick in the land big enough
for her, not one</i>

521
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,359
<i>Men went inside her and curled up</i>

522
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:39,158
<i>She wanted extension pricks,
self-exploding rockets...</i>

523
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:42,915
<i>...hot boiling oil made of wax
and creosote</i>

524
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:45,962
<i>She'd cut off your prick and
keep it inside her forever...</i>

525
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:47,924
<i>...if you gave her permission</i>

526
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:50,986
<i>One cunt out of a million</i>

527
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,474
<i>Llona</i>

528
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,467
<i>All cunt, and a glass ass </i>

529
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:59,266
<i>in which you could read the
history of the Middle Ages</i>

530
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:38,556
How lucky you are to be able to
afford the good things of life

531
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,475
All the bad things happen to me

532
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,488
First, my little baby...

533
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,442
...and now my mother is at home,
very ill

534
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,072
And there's a doctor to pay,
medicines to be bought

535
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:52,136
I'm always in difficulties for money

536
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:55,808
Why don't you come over to my hotel,
and you can tell me all about it

537
00:40:55,928 --> 00:40:59,852
Oh, I couldn't do that. I have to
look after my mother

538
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:02,022
You could come home with me

539
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,569
I have an apartment to myself

540
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,013
It will be peaceful

541
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:07,690
Ok, let's go

542
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,985
I gotta warn you, I only got 50 francs

543
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:13,902
50 francs! Come on, you're
surely joking with me

544
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:15,991
Bye. I made a mistake

545
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,180
You certainly have made a mistake

546
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,392
Ecouter cherie

547
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,458
Be reasonable

548
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:30,412
Ok. I'll be nice to you, you'll see

549
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,938
You were lying to me, then

550
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,769
Yeah, I was just lying to you

551
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,341
Taxi!

552
00:42:06,492 --> 00:42:11,232
My god, this place is in such a state,
this mother...has been sick

553
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:14,318
I can't find anything when I want it

554
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:18,173
No, don't sit there

555
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:20,100
Come over here, cherie

556
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:26,235
Oh, this dress. The zip always sticks

557
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:27,420
Can you?

558
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,882
Never mind. I've done it myself

559
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:34,941
Now, what are you waiting there for?

560
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:37,322
Hurry up and get undressed

561
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:41,569
Have you seen my diploma on the wall?

562
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,750
First-class honours. Mama
had it framed for me

563
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:49,591
Come on, get undressed, I think you
should hurry, you know

564
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,233
Where's my...mother disappeared to?

565
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:57,058
I must go to see mother, just a moment

566
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:04,999
You can have a bath, if you like,
I'll be back in a few minutes

567
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:20,831
She's going to die! She's going to die!

568
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,294
Oh dear, dear!

569
00:43:22,414 --> 00:43:25,131
If only I had the money for the doctor

570
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:27,284
Oh yeah, the money

571
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,899
Will you please take this for
your mother? -You're very kind

572
00:43:34,106 --> 00:43:36,901
But...the doctor is very expensive

573
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:40,125
-Yes, things are rough all over
-Ah, you're right

574
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,457
Come on, move over

575
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:57,484
Oh, darling!

576
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:59,539
I'm dying for you

577
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:01,100
I warn you

578
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:05,032
Yes, again, it's so beautiful

579
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:11,214
-Will you slow down? Where's the fire?
-Here, here!

580
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:21,322
Take it easy

581
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:23,878
Where's your mother?
Is she downstairs?

582
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:32,694
I must go and see mother!

583
00:45:33,902 --> 00:45:36,144
<i>Germaine was different</i>

584
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:39,073
<i>There was nothing to tell me so
from her appearance</i>

585
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:41,319
<i>But I'd noticed her
verging toward me</i>

586
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,930
<i>with that curious trot-about
air of a whore</i>

587
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,772
<i>and the run-down heels </i>

588
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:49,003
<i>cheap jewelry and
the pasty look of their kind </i>

589
00:45:49,123 --> 00:45:53,104
<i>In a few minutes, we were in a 5 franc
room on the Rue Amelot</i>

590
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:56,327
<i>the curtains drawn and the
covers thrown back</i>

591
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:59,134
<i>But she didnt rush things,
Germaine</i>

592
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:01,060
<i>She sat on the bidet</i>

593
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,320
<i>soaping herself and talked to me
pleasantly about this and that</i>

594
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,425
<i>As she stood up to dry herself</i>

595
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:09,580
<i>still talking to me pleasantly</i>

596
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,661
<i>suddenly, she dropped her towel</i>

597
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:13,624
<i>and advancing toward me leisurely</i>

598
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:16,439
<i>she commenced rubbing her
pussy affectionately</i>

599
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,493
<i>stroking it with her two hands,
caressing it, patting it</i>

600
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,665
<i>There was something about her
eloquence at that moment</i>

601
00:46:22,785 --> 00:46:25,919
<i>in the way she thrust that
rosebush under my nose</i>

602
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,823
<i>which remains unforgettable</i>

603
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:32,284
<i>she spoke of it as if it were
some extraneous object</i>

604
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:34,695
<i>which she had
acquired at great cost</i>

605
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:37,815
<i>an object whose value had
increased with time</i>

606
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:41,630
<i>and which now she prized above
everything in the world</i>

607
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,839
<i>Her words imbued it with a
peculiar fragrance</i>

608
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,888
<i>It was no longer just her private
organ, but a treasure</i>

609
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:53,356
<i>a magic, potent treasure,
a God-given thing</i>

610
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,653
<i>and none the less so because
she traded it</i>

611
00:46:55,773 --> 00:46:58,837
<i>day in, day out, for a few
pieces of silver</i>

612
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:02,973
<i>As she flung herself on the bed,
with legs spread wide apart</i>

613
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,760
<i>she cupped it with her hands
and stroked it some more</i>

614
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,949
<i>murmuring all the while in that
hoarse, cracked voice of hers</i>

615
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:10,386
<i>that it was good</i>

616
00:47:10,605 --> 00:47:11,448
<i>Beautiful</i>

617
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,843
<i>A treasure, a little treasure</i>

618
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:17,585
<i>And it was good, that little
pussy of hers</i>

619
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:21,486
<i>That Sunday afternoon, with its poisonous
breath of spring in the air</i>

620
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:23,456
<i>everything clicked again</i>

621
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:25,238
<i>As we stepped out of the hotel
</i>

622
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,271
<i>I looked her over again in
the harsh light of day</i>

623
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:30,949
<i>and I saw clearly what a
whore she was</i>

624
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:34,856
<i>the gold teeth, the rundown heels,
etc., etc.</i>

625
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,897
<i>Even the fact that she had wormed
a dinner out of me...</i>

626
00:47:38,017 --> 00:47:41,471
<i>...and cigarettes and taxi hadnt the
least disturbing effect upon me</i>

627
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,624
<i>I encouraged it, in fact</i>

628
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:45,889
<i>I liked her so well</i>

629
00:47:46,193 --> 00:47:48,697
<i>that after dinner we went back
to the hotel again</i>

630
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:50,449
<i>and took another shot at it</i>

631
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:52,580
<i> For love, this time</i>

632
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,097
<i>And again that big, bushy
thing of hers</i>

633
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:57,714
<i>worked its bloom and magic</i>

634
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:01,224
<i>It began to have an independent
existence  for me, too</i>

635
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:02,810
<i>There was Germaine...</i>

636
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:05,586
<i>...and there was
that rosebush of hers</i>

637
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,665
<i>I liked them separately
and I liked them together</i>

638
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:13,795
I don't think this earthy stuff is going
over too well with Irene

639
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,566
I think she's kind of an ethereal cunt

640
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,755
Ethereal or not she's rich,
she should be

641
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,802
worth a little effort at letter writing

642
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,618
Go on, now, where were we?

643
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:25,407
Rabelais...

644
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:28,903
"You send me golden apples,
Irene, dear..."

645
00:48:29,023 --> 00:48:31,809
"...and gifts of shaggy chestnuts, too"

646
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:34,948
She hasn't given you
anything, has she?

647
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:36,247
No

648
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,617
But I like that word: "shaggy"

649
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,179
"But if you follow them..."

650
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:45,145
"...the choicest gift you brought
would be just you"

651
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:48,091
You know, you say that like
you mean it?

652
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:52,212
Let's hit her with a little
dash of Keats

653
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:01,154
"Irene! Peerless nymph!"

654
00:49:01,611 --> 00:49:04,339
"Why fear such tenderness as mine?"

655
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:06,968
Now, wait a minute, this
is the real clincher

656
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:10,918
"Oh, let me have thee whole,
all, all be mine..."

657
00:49:11,038 --> 00:49:13,451
"...those hands, those eyes,
divine..."

658
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:17,844
"...that warm, white, lucent,
million-pleasured breast."

659
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:20,790
Jesus, that'll do it!

660
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,372
Let's pepper it up a bit

661
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:26,876
No, no, that's too morbid

662
00:49:28,453 --> 00:49:30,172
"Breathes there, man..."

663
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,492
"...with soul so dead..."

664
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:35,112
"...who to himself hath never said..."

665
00:49:35,232 --> 00:49:38,163
"...when I see Irene, I think of bed."

666
00:49:38,283 --> 00:49:40,733
Oh, it's not the same class!

667
00:49:40,975 --> 00:49:42,811
Besides, it's too pushy

668
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:46,186
We've got to bring this to
a delicate conclusion

669
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,270
Well, not too delicate, it's about
getting laid, you know

670
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,777
If the lady's any good at all
it's never far from her mind

671
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:55,544
All you have to do
is let her know

672
00:49:55,664 --> 00:49:58,128
that <i>you</i> know what
she's thinking about

673
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:04,267
Did you pay your rent?

674
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,032
It's from her

675
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:19,701
It's from Irene

676
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,019
Well?

677
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,991
A rendezvous

678
00:50:25,111 --> 00:50:27,311
Christ, you think she's watching us?

679
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:30,432
Come on, Carl, she's not
gonna eat you

680
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,440
Wish you hadn't said that.
Crude bastard

681
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,312
I can't go in yet! What's the time?

682
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:40,245
I'm two minutes early!

683
00:50:40,365 --> 00:50:43,458
Alright, alright, let's take a
walk around the block

684
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:47,325
Press button '2'

685
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:58,556
"The rescue team's been working
throughout the night..."

686
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:01,256
"...in an effort to reach the 12 miners
trapped since last Tuesday..."

687
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,013
"...in the Alsatian mining disaster."

688
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:05,998
"Investigation in the cause of disaster
has revealed..."

689
00:51:06,118 --> 00:51:09,382
"...that the collapse was due to faulty...
<i>tit props?</i>"

690
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:14,008
"...<i>Pit props</i>."

691
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,790
"Messages of consolation have
arrived from the government..."

692
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,885
I'll bet

693
00:51:23,786 --> 00:51:24,779
Yeah

694
00:51:24,971 --> 00:51:26,190
Henry, it's Carl

695
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,628
Look, Henry...Fill in for me
at the office, will you?

696
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,300
Tell the bastard I'm...anything

697
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,961
Tell him I'm dying!

698
00:51:34,345 --> 00:51:35,872
Ok, Carl

699
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:38,427
-What's happening?
-Hello?

700
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:40,592
Are you Henry Miller?

701
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:42,049
How are you?

702
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:44,486
You sound so nice

703
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:48,159
Hello, Joe? She likes you

704
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,878
I told her all about you

705
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,890
How we call each other "Joe"

706
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,219
She wants us to call her "Joe" too

707
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:55,479
Talk to you later, Henry

708
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,357
Ah, you...

709
00:51:58,308 --> 00:52:00,286
...son of a bitch

710
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:06,936
Help me read through these stock prices

711
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:09,806
What happened to Carl?

712
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:12,141
He says he's dying

713
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,628
Oh, so he's dying, is he,
the little prick?

714
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:17,666
Come on, give me the low-down
on this whole thing, huh?

715
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,522
He went to visit his rich cunt

716
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,393
He actually went to call her?

717
00:52:22,618 --> 00:52:23,803
Where's she live?

718
00:52:24,446 --> 00:52:27,658
Come on, you seem like a decent guy.
Let me in on this racket!

719
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,708
-It's not a racket
-What do you mean?

720
00:52:29,828 --> 00:52:32,103
A little prick like that slips off to
lay a rich, beautiful

721
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:34,314
hungry cunt, and you
say there's no racket?

722
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:35,846
Come on, come on!

723
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:37,595
Will you calm down, I'll tell you
everything

724
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:40,583
as soon as Carl gives
me the details, ok?

725
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:45,445
I like Van Norden but I don't agree
with his opinion of himself

726
00:52:45,565 --> 00:52:48,994
He's not a writer, he's just
cunt-struck, that's all

727
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,912
Come on, Carl, you're hanging me
up. Don't torture me, do it later

728
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:57,912
Now, tell me, was it good or was it bad?

729
00:52:58,463 --> 00:53:00,756
Wait. I'm gonna tell you everything

730
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:02,576
That means it was a failure

731
00:53:03,235 --> 00:53:06,139
No. It wasn't a failure

732
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:08,376
And it wasn't a success, either

733
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,044
You know? It's pretty strange

734
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,457
To think of all those letters
we wrote her

735
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,462
And then to find that...

736
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:21,468
Well...she was in her dressing gown

737
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:23,946
There was a bottle of champagne
on the dresser

738
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:25,774
The room was pretty dark

739
00:53:26,158 --> 00:53:28,409
Curtains drawn, not much light

740
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:31,038
But her voice was lovely

741
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:33,718
I know that, go on!

742
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,437
It must've been 9 o'clock...

743
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:38,426
...because I remember I looked at
my watch to check

744
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:41,205
Well, the next time I looked at
my watch it was 10 o'clock

745
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:44,577
She was lying on the divan with
her boobies in her hands

746
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,177
At 11 o'clock it was all settled

747
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:48,929
We were going to run away, to Borneo!

748
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:50,972
Didn't she have a husband or something?

749
00:53:51,092 --> 00:53:53,379
Ah, fuck the husband, she
never loved him anyway

750
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:55,512
She never would've
written that first letter

751
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,459
if the husband hadn't
been old and passionless

752
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:00,357
And when she says to me...

753
00:54:00,902 --> 00:54:02,170
"...but listen dear"

754
00:54:02,688 --> 00:54:06,201
"How do I know you won't
grow tired of me?"

755
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:08,032
Ah, what'd you say?

756
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:09,424
-What do you expect me to say?

757
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,404
"How could anyone ever grow
tired of you?"

758
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:16,509
Carl, you're the cutest,
what happened then?

759
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:17,813
I don't know...

760
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:20,851
Oh, I kissed her breasts a lot,
she seemed to go for that

761
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:23,330
But then I got sort of tired of them
staring me in the face

762
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:27,177
So I stuffed them back in her corsage,
or whatever they call those things

763
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,193
Wasn't that a step backwards?

764
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:30,191
No!

765
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:32,344
They get hotter if they think
you're cooling off

766
00:54:32,464 --> 00:54:34,911
So, then we had another
coupe of champagne

767
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:36,540
Ah, there I was, all the time

768
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,155
sitting with my semi-colons wondering
whether I could...

769
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:42,148
...afford to go the can for five minutes

770
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:44,502
And I'm dying to take a leak!

771
00:54:44,836 --> 00:54:46,380
I had one hard-on

772
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:47,863
But it faded out

773
00:54:49,582 --> 00:54:50,549
I grab hold of her hand

774
00:54:50,669 --> 00:54:53,731
I pull her to her feet, and I start
walking her to the door

775
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:56,012
I tell her I love her, I adore her

776
00:54:56,132 --> 00:54:59,069
I'll go anywhere she says, Istanbul,
Singapore, you name it

777
00:54:59,189 --> 00:55:01,418
...only just now I <i>must</i> go,
it's getting late

778
00:55:02,395 --> 00:55:05,338
Carl, you didn't even tell me
whether she's beautiful

779
00:55:05,718 --> 00:55:07,788
A woman with a voice like that?

780
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,659
When I talked to her on the
phone, I was stunned

781
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:14,426
I wanted to say one true thing to
her, no matter how silly

782
00:55:14,546 --> 00:55:16,666
after all that crap we wrote her

783
00:55:16,786 --> 00:55:18,188
Was she beautiful?

784
00:55:19,598 --> 00:55:22,623
She had a streak of grey hair
across her forehead

785
00:55:23,506 --> 00:55:24,674
I remember that

786
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,079
You see, I'd almost forgotten it

787
00:55:28,515 --> 00:55:30,220
But it was her arms

788
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:31,906
They were thin

789
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:33,825
They were thin, and...

790
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:35,252
...brittle

791
00:55:42,086 --> 00:55:45,507
If she wrote me ten years younger,
I might overlook the streak of grey hair

792
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,295
And even the brittle arms

793
00:55:47,662 --> 00:55:49,573
But she's too old

794
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:50,867
You see...

795
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:54,074
...with a cunt like that
every year counts now

796
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,155
She won't just be <i>one</i> year
older next year

797
00:55:58,275 --> 00:55:59,745
she'll be <i>ten </i>years older

798
00:56:00,282 --> 00:56:02,685
In another year, she'll be
twenty years older

799
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,767
I'll be getting younger looking
all the time

800
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:07,707
At least for another five years

801
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:09,038
How did it end?

802
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,968
That's just it, it didn't end

803
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,431
I promised to meet her Tuesday

804
00:56:14,057 --> 00:56:15,359
Oh, and that's not all

805
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:17,512
I promised to write her a letter
in the meantime

806
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:21,259
How am I going to write her a letter now?
I haven't got anything to say

807
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,997
Oh, shit

808
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:26,095
If she were only ten years younger

809
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:27,867
Listen...

810
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,903
Do you think I ought to go with her?

811
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:32,807
To Borneo, or wherever it is
she wants to take me?

812
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,436
I don't know how to shoot

813
00:56:35,556 --> 00:56:38,018
I'm afraid of guns and all
that sort of thing

814
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:40,810
Besides, she'll want me to fuck
her night and day

815
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:43,283
Nothing but humping and
fucking all the time

816
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,063
I can't do it!

817
00:56:50,028 --> 00:56:52,164
She said she was turning forty

818
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,405
That means fifty

819
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:55,073
Or sixty

820
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:58,814
It'd be like fucking your own mother

821
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:02,202
Well, she must've had something, you were
kissing her breasts, for Christ's sake

822
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:03,800
Kissing her breasts, what's that?

823
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,836
Besides it was dark, I'm telling you

824
00:57:06,471 --> 00:57:10,051
Look at that. It's coming apart,
the goddamn suit

825
00:57:11,121 --> 00:57:12,665
<i>I'm </i>coming apart

826
00:57:12,785 --> 00:57:14,376
<i>Irene</i> is certainly coming apart

827
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,216
You can forgive a young cunt anything

828
00:57:16,424 --> 00:57:17,995
She doesn't have to have any brains

829
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,906
They're better off without any brains

830
00:57:20,624 --> 00:57:22,201
But an old cunt...

831
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:26,960
See, an old cunt,
even if she's brilliant

832
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,462
Even if she's the most charming woman
in the world

833
00:57:29,582 --> 00:57:31,134
nothing makes any difference

834
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:33,930
A young cunt is an investment

835
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,033
An old cunt is a dead loss

836
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,325
All they can do for you is
buy you things

837
00:57:39,117 --> 00:57:40,887
With you, it's different

838
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:43,700
You don't have to lay her, you can
afford to like her

839
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:45,623
Maybe you would like her!

840
00:57:45,743 --> 00:57:48,766
Listen, if she's rich I'll like her,
I don't care how old she is

841
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:50,238
As long as she's not a hag

842
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:51,557
She's not a hag

843
00:57:51,974 --> 00:57:53,560
What are you talking about?

844
00:57:54,955 --> 00:57:57,350
If that's how it is, I'll fuck her

845
00:57:57,692 --> 00:58:00,680
Ah, if you don't want to. Tell her that.

846
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,324
You be subtle about it, though

847
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,447
Perhaps...

848
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,445
We'll go to Borneo together

849
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:10,249
I don't know how to shoot either,
that doesn't matter, we'll-

850
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:13,501
We'll drive, we'll hunt,
wear nice things

851
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:15,165
You know if we go to Borneo

852
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:17,393
I won't have hemorrhoids anymore

853
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:19,631
Maybe I'll develop something else

854
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,733
Something worse

855
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:22,419
Cholera, do you think?

856
00:58:22,863 --> 00:58:25,408
Ah listen, it's better to die of a good
disease like that, than to

857
00:58:25,528 --> 00:58:28,905
piss your life away on a newspaper,
with grapes up your ass

858
00:58:29,025 --> 00:58:30,502
and buttons falling off your pants

859
00:58:30,762 --> 00:58:34,382
What would you rather do? Be a cripple
all your life or have a job?

860
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:35,909
Or marry a rich cunt?

861
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:39,222
Ah, you'd rather marry a rich
cunt, I can see that

862
00:58:39,626 --> 00:58:41,065
Supposing you married her

863
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,204
and then you couldn't get a
hard-on anymore?

864
00:58:43,597 --> 00:58:45,316
Oh, that happens sometimes!

865
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:46,559
What would you do then?

866
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,840
No, the best thing would be to marry her

867
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,313
and then get a good disease right away

868
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:52,433
You wouldn't have to worry
about laying her

869
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:54,406
and you wouldn't have to worry
about the rent either!

870
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:56,604
That's the best solution for a writer

871
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:58,147
Listen...

872
00:58:59,048 --> 00:59:02,294
All I want is a good wheelchair
and three meals a day

873
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,231
Then I'd give them something to
read, those pricks

874
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,655
Well. What happened to you?

875
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,545
You should've stayed around for a Pernod

876
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:14,774
Carl talked about that dame,
Irene, for two solid hours

877
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:16,727
I could use a Pernod now

878
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,759
I was out looking for Fillmore

879
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:23,749
Fillmore's been taken to a funny
farm outside Paris

880
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,261
I wonder if that guy's putting us on?

881
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:28,013
That girlfriend of his gave me
the address

882
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:29,655
It's around somewhere

883
00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:32,549
But Carl now

884
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:34,051
That guy's an artist

885
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:36,921
He described every detail, minutely

886
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,043
He gave it to me with such accuracy

887
00:59:39,163 --> 00:59:41,126
I know the whole goddamn
thing is a lie

888
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:43,441
But I can't get it out of my mind

889
00:59:44,008 --> 00:59:45,493
You know how my mind works

890
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:47,485
He told you the whole story,
didn't he?

891
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,568
What do you think, you
think he made it up?

892
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,973
I think he invented the
whole thing just to torture <i>me</i>

893
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:54,942
I don't care about that

894
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,415
I don't care if the whole thing
is a lie from start to finish

895
00:59:57,535 --> 00:59:58,767
it's the images that get me

896
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,643
I didn't sleep a wink for
thinking of it. -No?

897
01:00:01,763 --> 01:00:02,706
Yeah

898
01:00:03,173 --> 01:00:06,973
Just like that guy to tell me he put
it to her six or seven times

899
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:09,926
Yeah, well that's a lot of shit

900
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:13,598
The way he tells me, that she rented a
carriage and drove him to the Bois

901
01:00:13,718 --> 01:00:16,454
and used her husband's fur
coat for a blanket?

902
01:00:16,574 --> 01:00:18,348
That's too much!

903
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:20,702
I suppose he told you about
the chauffeur

904
01:00:20,822 --> 01:00:22,657
how the chauffeur waited patiently?

905
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:24,116
And, listen...

906
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:27,788
...did he tell about how the
motor purred all the time?

907
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,487
He's such a cute little liar, you
can't walk away from him

908
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:36,851
You know, I don't understand how
a guy writes letters like that

909
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:38,778
I don't get the mentality behind it

910
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,707
I think it's a kind of masturbation,
what do you think?

911
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:44,069
I suppose he told you the whole
thing, huh?

912
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:47,003
Did he tell you about, how he stood
in the moonlight on the balcony

913
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:48,036
and he kissed her?

914
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:50,706
-Yeah
-But the way that boy described it

915
01:00:51,238 --> 01:00:55,061
I can just see that little prick standing
there with his arms around a woman

916
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:58,053
And already he's writing her
another one of those letters

917
01:00:58,173 --> 01:01:02,239
About the rooftops and all that crap
he steals from his French authors

918
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:05,752
That guy never said a thing
that's original, I found that out

919
01:01:05,872 --> 01:01:08,700
But you have to get a clue
to whom he's been reading lately

920
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:11,221
And that's damn hard to do
because he's so damn secretive

921
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,237
It's the <i>way </i>he tells it to me

922
01:01:13,612 --> 01:01:15,832
You know how he embroiders things

923
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:18,917
After that scene on the balcony,
you know

924
01:01:19,037 --> 01:01:20,832
he sort of gives me that like
an hors d'ouvres

925
01:01:20,952 --> 01:01:22,302
Well, after that scene on the balcony

926
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:25,432
so he says, they went inside and he
unbuttoned her pyjamas

927
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,320
What're you smiling for, was
he shitting me about that?

928
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,757
No, he told me just the
same way you're telling me

929
01:01:30,877 --> 01:01:33,327
Oh. Well, after that, he says

930
01:01:33,686 --> 01:01:36,623
She sitting in a chair, with her
legs up, not a stitch on

931
01:01:36,743 --> 01:01:39,049
He's down on the floor looking up at her

932
01:01:39,169 --> 01:01:40,872
and telling her how beautiful she is

933
01:01:41,385 --> 01:01:44,091
Did he tell you how she looked
like a Matisse?

934
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,913
What I'm getting at, is that moment
when he said he was down on his knees

935
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:49,943
and with his two skinny little fingers

936
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:52,229
he spreads her cunt open. Remember that?

937
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,574
He said she was sitting
there in the chair

938
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:56,162
with her legs dangling over the edge

939
01:01:56,282 --> 01:01:58,031
when he suddenly gets this inspiration

940
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,679
You know, that's after he's already
given her a couple of lays

941
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,673
and given her a little spiel about
the Matisse, but

942
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:04,439
now, get this

943
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,786
with these two fingers, just
the tips of them, mind you

944
01:02:07,906 --> 01:02:10,081
he spread the little petals open

945
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:12,118
Squish, squish

946
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,144
Just like that, a little sticky
sound, almost inaudible

947
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:18,003
Squish, squish

948
01:02:18,487 --> 01:02:20,857
Jesus, I've been hearing it all day

949
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,597
And then, if that wasn't enough for me,
he said he buried his head in her muff

950
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:29,354
And then, by Christ, if she doesn't
swing her legs around his neck!

951
01:02:29,898 --> 01:02:32,235
When he told me that, oh boy,
that finished me

952
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:33,703
Can you imagine?

953
01:02:33,823 --> 01:02:36,935
A fine sensitive woman like that swinging
her legs around his neck

954
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,075
It's poisonous!

955
01:02:38,298 --> 01:02:40,126
It's so fantastic it's almost believable

956
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,264
Sounds pretty incredible

957
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,328
Still, you never can tell with
a little prick like that

958
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:46,264
I suppose anything can happen

959
01:02:48,937 --> 01:02:50,781
Maybe he didn't fuck her at all

960
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:53,767
Maybe she just let him diddle her?

961
01:02:54,101 --> 01:02:55,672
Well, you never can tell with
these rich cunts

962
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:58,213
you know, what they might
expect you to do

963
01:02:59,002 --> 01:03:01,405
Well, I better go see Fillmore

964
01:03:23,892 --> 01:03:25,461
It's all over, Joe

965
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:28,824
They say I'm crazy

966
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,802
Fuck 'em

967
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:35,503
They say I may have syphilis too

968
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,001
They say I've got delusions of grandeur

969
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:49,663
What did they put me in this
expensive room for, huh?

970
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:53,309
Why don't they put me in the ward?

971
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:56,482
Or in the bughouse!

972
01:03:58,006 --> 01:03:59,717
I can't afford this

973
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:03,238
I'm down to my last 500 dollars

974
01:04:04,532 --> 01:04:06,726
That's why they got you here, pal

975
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:09,472
When you run out of dough, they'll

976
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:12,100
move you out of here quick enough,
don't worry about it

977
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:15,530
Here, hold onto these for me

978
01:04:16,097 --> 01:04:18,576
They'll rob me of everything I've got

979
01:04:23,835 --> 01:04:25,279
I know

980
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:31,199
I know you think I'm crazy, but
I want to atone for what I did

981
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:33,802
I want to get married

982
01:04:35,651 --> 01:04:38,313
I didn't know I had the clap!

983
01:04:41,818 --> 01:04:45,590
See, I gave her the clap, and
I knocked her up

984
01:04:48,354 --> 01:04:51,509
I don't care what happens, but
I'm going to marry her first

985
01:04:51,629 --> 01:04:54,616
He keeps telling me to wait
until I get better

986
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:57,979
But I'm not going to get
better, Joe, this is the end

987
01:04:58,099 --> 01:04:59,511
Come on, Joe

988
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:02,215
I'm dying, Joe

989
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:07,053
And Ginette?

990
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:09,152
Who's gonna take care of her?

991
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:11,591
Who's gonna take care of her
after I'm gone?

992
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:12,897
After you're gone?

993
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:18,185
You can take care of her

994
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:19,979
You're healthy

995
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:22,496
Joe? Would you take care of her?

996
01:05:22,616 --> 01:05:24,018
Ah, easy boy, easy

997
01:05:24,138 --> 01:05:25,776
Would you? For me

998
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:30,215
Where does she live?

999
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:35,234
You're a good guy, Joe

1000
01:05:35,467 --> 01:05:38,004
That's right, I am.
Where's she living?

1001
01:05:38,713 --> 01:05:40,883
Somewhere in the sixth floor

1002
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:46,237
Everyone in Paris lives on the
sixth or seventh floor

1003
01:05:46,357 --> 01:05:50,512
so by the time you get up
there, you're incapable

1004
01:05:56,113 --> 01:05:57,507
They're all in on it

1005
01:05:58,742 --> 01:05:59,568
Yeah

1006
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,615
Sixth floor. Where?

1007
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:09,252
365 Rue La Bos

1008
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:12,964
Ok, look

1009
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:17,931
I'll find the girl, hold her hand,
explain everything

1010
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,526
Now don't worry about anything.

1011
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:22,688
just lay back, eat your oranges

1012
01:06:22,808 --> 01:06:25,960
you know they might be charging
you rent for them

1013
01:06:35,823 --> 01:06:37,392
Ginette?

1014
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,089
Sit down, please

1015
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:43,777
And you think he keeps his position
when he leaves hospital?

1016
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:48,028
Oh, his job you mean. I suppose so

1017
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,014
You speak good English, Ginette

1018
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:53,421
We were pulled together by
common tongues

1019
01:06:54,698 --> 01:06:56,534
That must've been nice

1020
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,408
But I beg of you, tell me what you think

1021
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:03,429
Jo-Jo want to marry me, he say that

1022
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,532
But if he does not...

1023
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:11,697
...you know, a young
girl, in a delicate condition

1024
01:07:12,064 --> 01:07:15,586
And with the other thing, besides

1025
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,896
If he leaves me, what I'm going to do?

1026
01:07:20,564 --> 01:07:21,490
There

1027
01:07:23,493 --> 01:07:26,414
Fillmore is a perfect gentleman

1028
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:29,395
He's thinking about you all the time

1029
01:07:29,996 --> 01:07:31,876
I'm certain he's gonna stand by you

1030
01:07:31,996 --> 01:07:35,696
I'll be the godfather to
the child, how's that?

1031
01:07:38,432 --> 01:07:40,168
Oh, you are so good

1032
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:42,421
All the same...

1033
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:44,448
...are you certain you want this child?

1034
01:07:44,568 --> 01:07:47,511
If you have this condition you spoke
of, it might be born blind

1035
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,756
Don't say such things!

1036
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:52,257
It doesn't make any difference to me

1037
01:07:52,377 --> 01:07:54,602
I want a child of my Jo-Jo

1038
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:08,894
Are you alright?

1039
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,563
Oh yes

1040
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:14,280
I was thinking of
Jo-Jo and me in the bed

1041
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:16,533
How we did fight

1042
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,337
You know, he likes to fight with me

1043
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:21,507
He was a brute!

1044
01:08:23,837 --> 01:08:25,540
Oh, do you want some cheese?

1045
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,039
Here is my friend, Yvette

1046
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:46,086
-Monsieur Henry, the friend of Jo-Jo
-Enchanté, monsieur

1047
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:53,419
Yvette makes a job
of national importance

1048
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:55,886
She is a spy for the police

1049
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:58,173
Oh god

1050
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:01,243
Come on, what does she actually do?

1051
01:09:01,778 --> 01:09:05,123
I regulate the inspection of the ladies

1052
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:07,735
Sounds like pretty essential work

1053
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:09,690
I take you to work in taxi

1054
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,800
I just change my robe, and I
come with you

1055
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:18,176
Ginette is a whore

1056
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,318
And she has no baby, neither

1057
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:24,828
Maybe she has the clap,
yes, but she isn't pregnant

1058
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:28,701
Well why the hell does she want to
marry him? Does she love him?

1059
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,769
She wants someone to take care of her

1060
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:33,818
No frenchman would marry
her, she has a long police record

1061
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,877
But if she can marry a rich American...!

1062
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:41,022
Henry? You write your address
and leave it on the table

1063
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:42,977
I'm with you in a moment

1064
01:09:43,453 --> 01:09:47,225
There's the address. I've got
a bed at Boris's

1065
01:09:53,497 --> 01:09:55,492
Good morning

1066
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:57,010
Who are you?

1067
01:09:57,394 --> 01:10:00,459
Hands off, Joe. Elsa's staying a few
days to lend tone to the business

1068
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:02,745
She's gonna show people in when
they come to see the apartment

1069
01:10:03,154 --> 01:10:04,756
You want some breakfast?

1070
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:07,287
I have some hot croissant and jam

1071
01:10:07,548 --> 01:10:09,782
Now, don't give him breakfast,
it'll encourage him to stay

1072
01:10:09,902 --> 01:10:11,451
He's been here long enough

1073
01:10:11,857 --> 01:10:13,833
Why don't you move in with
Fillmore again?

1074
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:16,286
I hear they let him out of the nut-hatch

1075
01:10:16,615 --> 01:10:19,342
Fillmore will probably be
living with Ginette

1076
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:21,378
and I wouldn't want to disturb
a happy couple

1077
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:23,920
That hasn't worried you up 'til now

1078
01:10:24,523 --> 01:10:26,370
Straighten the place up a little

1079
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:30,321
Artistic disorder is ok but
this is ridiculous

1080
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,319
He needs a woman

1081
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:45,214
"My..."

1082
01:10:45,564 --> 01:10:47,092
"...dear..."

1083
01:10:47,492 --> 01:10:49,119
"...Walter"

1084
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,448
"Today..."

1085
01:10:52,176 --> 01:10:54,454
"...my heart..."

1086
01:10:54,829 --> 01:10:57,032
"...is filled..."

1087
01:11:00,437 --> 01:11:03,491
"...with sorrow"

1088
01:11:04,668 --> 01:11:05,948
Lieber Got!

1089
01:11:06,068 --> 01:11:08,175
What's happened to the world?

1090
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:10,834
Aw, let me help

1091
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,263
I have no luck, no luck never

1092
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:17,178
I try to write to my lover,
so far away

1093
01:11:17,298 --> 01:11:18,469
and what's happened?

1094
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:20,127
The typewriter jams

1095
01:11:20,272 --> 01:11:24,202
Oh, poor girl, poor Elsa

1096
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:34,617
I am so sad. So sad

1097
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:47,065
<i>Ah, the Germans! </i>

1098
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:49,719
<i>They take you all
over like an omnibus</i>

1099
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,927
<i>They give you indigestion</i>

1100
01:11:52,823 --> 01:11:56,478
<i>In the same night, one cannot
visit the morgue, the infirmary...</i>

1101
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:59,007
<i>...the zoo, the signs
of the zodiac...</i>

1102
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:02,887
<i>...the limbos of philosophy,
the caves of epistemology...</i>

1103
01:12:03,007 --> 01:12:06,167
<i>...the arcana of
Freud and Stekel.</i>

1104
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:08,695
<i>On the merry-go-round
one doesn't get anywhere</i>...

1105
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:13,253
...<i>whereas with the Germans,
one can go from Vega to Lope de Vega</i>

1106
01:12:13,373 --> 01:12:17,684
<i>all in one night and come
away as foolish as Parsifal.</i>

1107
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:21,342
Always the same

1108
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,011
Always

1109
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:28,064
Men use me...

1110
01:12:28,899 --> 01:12:30,835
...and cast me aside

1111
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:34,092
You know, if you can play
the piano like this

1112
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:37,118
you should have better sense than
to let yourself be tripped up

1113
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:41,917
by every guy with a big putz who just
happened to come along

1114
01:12:42,848 --> 01:12:44,700
But what can I do?

1115
01:12:45,118 --> 01:12:46,620
I like it

1116
01:12:46,978 --> 01:12:48,789
And this is the living room

1117
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:51,450
I can see that

1118
01:13:03,469 --> 01:13:04,408
Henry

1119
01:13:04,528 --> 01:13:06,955
Hey Fillmore, you old nut!

1120
01:13:07,274 --> 01:13:08,334
They let him out, huh?

1121
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:11,485
-Yeah, I'm fine now
-He looks good now, eh, my fiance?

1122
01:13:11,605 --> 01:13:13,384
I see you're on the move again, huh?

1123
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,384
Yeah, Boris kicked me out

1124
01:13:16,504 --> 01:13:18,277
I've gotta find a hotel tonight

1125
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:20,519
You know, unless I can find
someplace to stay

1126
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,426
Ginette, why don't you go do some
shopping. Yeah, it'll be alright

1127
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:25,899
We'll be right there at the cafe, ok?

1128
01:13:29,223 --> 01:13:30,566
Come on

1129
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:36,151
Have another, I don't care

1130
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,612
It's her father's money

1131
01:13:37,732 --> 01:13:42,399
My job's gone and we're supposed to get
married in a month or so

1132
01:13:46,112 --> 01:13:48,180
Oh, once they get me properly
in their clutches

1133
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:49,837
I'll be nothing but a slave

1134
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,271
Ok

1135
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:54,378
First you get married,
then you get divorced

1136
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,522
Meanwhile she'll be dropping the kid

1137
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:58,730
Who's gonna take care of it, huh?

1138
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:04,530
Hey fella, some girls are naturally
fat around the middle

1139
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:08,059
Yvette told me that Ginette's
not pregnant

1140
01:14:08,215 --> 01:14:10,251
What do you mean?

1141
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:14,782
I know she's gonna have a kid alright,
I felt it kicking around inside of her

1142
01:14:15,049 --> 01:14:17,595
That Yvette's a dirty little slut

1143
01:14:19,065 --> 01:14:22,111
You see, Joe, I didn't want to
admit this to you, but...

1144
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:26,463
...before I went to the hospital,
I was putting out for Yvette too

1145
01:14:26,936 --> 01:14:28,622
Then when the crack up came I couldn't

1146
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:32,854
I mean, I felt like I'd done enough
for both of them, right?

1147
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:39,532
No, no, that Yvette's just...
sore at me, that's all

1148
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:42,310
Boy, I wish it were true

1149
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,806
I could get out of this more easily

1150
01:14:46,197 --> 01:14:48,767
They've got me by the balls now

1151
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:51,081
God, here she comes again

1152
01:14:56,309 --> 01:14:58,178
That's ok, honey

1153
01:14:58,298 --> 01:15:00,231
We're just having a little drink
on your father

1154
01:15:00,548 --> 01:15:02,442
Drink, my father?

1155
01:15:02,562 --> 01:15:04,456
My father never drink!

1156
01:15:04,576 --> 01:15:05,838
No honey, that's...

1157
01:15:05,999 --> 01:15:09,946
He's trying to explain that the fact is
your old man's paying for these drinks

1158
01:15:10,324 --> 01:15:13,687
So, now I'm not understanding
English, eh?

1159
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:17,858
Is that incredible? -Pal, how do you
work yourself into these situations?

1160
01:15:17,978 --> 01:15:19,230
You're laughing

1161
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:20,928
You make fun of me

1162
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:23,568
You mock at your fiancée with strangers

1163
01:15:23,688 --> 01:15:26,240
-Ginette, don't be stupid
-How I stupid?!

1164
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,114
Ginette. I want you to just-

1165
01:15:31,468 --> 01:15:34,182
Yeah, that'll teach you how to behave

1166
01:15:44,814 --> 01:15:46,291
Come on

1167
01:15:48,436 --> 01:15:49,955
Fuck you!

1168
01:16:18,384 --> 01:16:20,044
Go home!

1169
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:25,418
Why?

1170
01:16:40,928 --> 01:16:45,904
<i>Today I awoke from a sound sleep
with curses of joy on my lips</i>

1171
01:16:46,024 --> 01:16:49,726
<i>with gibberish on my tongue,
repeating to myself like a litany</i>

1172
01:16:49,846 --> 01:16:51,727
<i>Fay ce que vouldras!</i>

1173
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:54,897
<i>Do anything, but
let it produce joy</i>

1174
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:58,066
<i>Do anything, but
let it yield ecstasy</i>

1175
01:16:58,863 --> 01:17:01,840
<i>So much crowds into my head
when I say this to myself</i>

1176
01:17:02,195 --> 01:17:06,776
<i>Images, gay ones,
terrible ones, maddening ones</i>

1177
01:17:06,918 --> 01:17:08,702
<i>The wolf and the goat</i>

1178
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:11,605
<i>Syphilis with her
wings outstretched </i>

1179
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:14,704
<i>and the door of the womb
always on the latch</i>

1180
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,504
<i>Always open, ready, like the tomb</i>

1181
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:21,298
<i>Lust, crime, holiness</i>

1182
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:23,803
<i>The lives of my adored ones</i>

1183
01:17:23,923 --> 01:17:27,780
The failures of my adored ones,
the words they left behind them

1184
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,741
The words they left unfinished

1185
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,724
But...above all...

1186
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:34,052
...the ecstasy

1187
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:46,106
Hey!

1188
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,250
What's the matter with you?

1189
01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:51,805
I have a half hour to go to
the bank, and no more

1190
01:17:51,925 --> 01:17:53,543
She keeps tabs on me

1191
01:17:53,845 --> 01:17:56,172
Come on, let's have a drink. Come on.

1192
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:05,926
I just don't know what to do anymore

1193
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:09,180
You're gonna have to do something
for me, Henry, I'm helpless

1194
01:18:10,048 --> 01:18:12,218
She won't let me out of her sight!

1195
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,824
The French

1196
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,287
You know, I used to rave about them,
but that was all literature

1197
01:18:18,072 --> 01:18:19,982
I know what they're really like

1198
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:23,089
They're cruel, and mercenary, and mean

1199
01:18:23,373 --> 01:18:25,977
There's no sympathy, no friendship

1200
01:18:26,097 --> 01:18:28,338
The most selfish people on earth

1201
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:32,712
They think of nothing but
money, money, money

1202
01:18:33,063 --> 01:18:37,666
And so goddamn respectable and
bourgouis, that's what drives me nuts

1203
01:18:37,786 --> 01:18:41,835
Oh sure, I hate those puritanical
bastards back home

1204
01:18:41,955 --> 01:18:44,356
I hate them as much as you do, but
I'm one of them myself

1205
01:18:45,624 --> 01:18:47,888
I don't belong here

1206
01:18:48,597 --> 01:18:50,124
I'm sick of it

1207
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:52,369
Look here, Fillmore

1208
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,932
What is it you really wanna do?

1209
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:59,794
I'd like to be home with my people

1210
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:04,192
I'd like to hear English spoken

1211
01:19:04,652 --> 01:19:07,944
Listen, if that's what you really
want to do, why don't you do it?

1212
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:09,411
Why don't you go?

1213
01:19:09,671 --> 01:19:10,915
I'd go today

1214
01:19:11,035 --> 01:19:15,947
Yes, by Jesus, I'd go today without
even saying goodbye to her

1215
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:18,887
That money at the bank...

1216
01:19:19,173 --> 01:19:22,769
Is that her Father's money or
is it yours? -That's mine

1217
01:19:23,729 --> 01:19:25,089
My mother sent it to me

1218
01:19:25,209 --> 01:19:27,420
I don't want any of her goddamn money

1219
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,799
Suppose we hop in a cab, we
go right down there

1220
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:32,969
you check out every last cent

1221
01:19:33,276 --> 01:19:35,646
This afternoon you hop a train to London

1222
01:19:35,766 --> 01:19:38,458
In London, you catch the
first boat for America

1223
01:19:38,578 --> 01:19:40,829
You can't go back and get any of
your things

1224
01:19:41,113 --> 01:19:42,552
Let her keep them

1225
01:19:42,806 --> 01:19:44,170
See, in that French mind of hers

1226
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:47,819
she'll never suspect you scooted
off without bag or baggage

1227
01:19:48,436 --> 01:19:51,931
No Frenchman would ever dream
of doing a thing like that

1228
01:19:52,051 --> 01:19:54,359
unless he's as cracked as you are

1229
01:19:54,718 --> 01:19:57,799
Here. That's every bit of it

1230
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:03,586
The closer you get to New York the more
this'll seem just like a bad dream

1231
01:20:18,904 --> 01:20:20,067
What are you gonna tell her?

1232
01:20:20,187 --> 01:20:23,058
Don't worry about what I'm gonna
tell her. I'm gonna tell her

1233
01:20:23,178 --> 01:20:25,901
The important thing is, how much
you wanna give her?

1234
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:27,111
All of it

1235
01:20:27,302 --> 01:20:28,777
Why give her anything?

1236
01:20:28,897 --> 01:20:31,285
-Oh Joe
-Ok, let's give her this French money

1237
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:33,915
That should hold her for a while

1238
01:20:34,336 --> 01:20:35,529
How much is it?

1239
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:39,788
She has two or three thousand francs
there, that's more than she deserves

1240
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:43,026
Christ, will you don't say that,
Joe, please!

1241
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:46,308
I mean, it's a lousy, rotten deal
I'm giving her, you know

1242
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:49,454
She'll never be able to go back
to her parents

1243
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:53,927
Give it all to her, give her the whole
damn thing, I don't care what it is

1244
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:55,304
Stop!

1245
01:20:55,424 --> 01:20:57,637
Hey, you can't do that, it's too late

1246
01:20:58,092 --> 01:21:00,308
You know what, you're gonna
go get on that train

1247
01:21:00,428 --> 01:21:02,853
You can't go back there now.
It's settled

1248
01:21:03,045 --> 01:21:05,365
I just don't want her to kill
herself, that's all

1249
01:21:05,623 --> 01:21:07,685
Kill herself?! Not <i>her</i>

1250
01:21:07,805 --> 01:21:10,524
As far as the money's concerned,
don't worry

1251
01:21:10,774 --> 01:21:14,187
Though I hate to give it to her, I'll go right
to the Post Office and I'll telegraph it

1252
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:22,514
Here, send her a postcard,
tell her you're sailing

1253
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,589
Tell her you love her, go on

1254
01:21:34,018 --> 01:21:37,722
I'll see her tonight, don't worry,
it's gonna be great, you'll see

1255
01:21:41,935 --> 01:21:45,431
Hurry up, the train's leaving, let's go

1256
01:22:10,213 --> 01:22:12,491
Henry! Bye, Henry!

1257
01:22:14,546 --> 01:22:16,023
Bye!

1258
01:22:27,626 --> 01:22:29,003
Cab!

1259
01:22:44,969 --> 01:22:50,059
<i>Suddenly it occurs to me that, if I
want, I can go to America myself</i>

1260
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:54,370
<i>It's the first time the opportunity's
ever presented itself</i>

1261
01:22:55,963 --> 01:22:59,332
<i>My thoughts drift out toward the
sea, toward the other side</i>

1262
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:03,034
<i>where, taking a last look back, I had
seen the skyscrapers</i>

1263
01:23:03,154 --> 01:23:06,272
<i>fading out in a
flurry of snowflakes</i>

1264
01:23:06,472 --> 01:23:12,098
<i>I see them looming up again, in the
same ghostly way as when I left</i>

1265
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:15,402
<i>see the lights creeping
through their ribs</i>

1266
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:19,406
<i>I see the whole city spread
out, from Harlem to the Battery</i>

1267
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:24,101
<i>The streets choked with ants,
the theatres empty</i>

1268
01:23:28,772 --> 01:23:33,479
<i>I wonder, in a vague way, whatever
happened to my wife</i>

1269
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:38,242
<i>After everything quietly sifted
through my head</i>

1270
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:41,607
<i>a great peace came over me</i>

1271
01:23:41,995 --> 01:23:45,886
<i>Here, where the river gently winds
through the girdle of the hills</i>

1272
01:23:46,006 --> 01:23:49,012
<i>lies a soil so
saturated with the past</i>

1273
01:23:49,132 --> 01:23:52,224
<i>That however far back the mind roams,
one can never detach it</i>

1274
01:23:52,344 --> 01:23:54,524
<i>from its human background</i>

1275
01:23:55,532 --> 01:23:56,884
<i>Christ</i>

1276
01:23:57,243 --> 01:24:00,631
<i>Before my eyes, there shimmers
such a golden peace</i>

1277
01:24:00,751 --> 01:24:03,760
<i>that only a neurotic could dream
of turning his head away</i>

1278
01:24:04,027 --> 01:24:09,103
<i>So quietly flows the Seine, that one
hardly notices its presence</i>

1279
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:12,327
<i>It is always there,
quiet and unobtrusive</i>

1280
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:16,176
<i> like a great artery running through
the human body</i>

1281
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:20,430
<i>In the wonderful peace that
falls over me</i>

1282
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:23,859
<i>it seems as if I'd climbed to the
top of a high mountain</i>

1283
01:24:24,289 --> 01:24:26,848
<i>For a little while I will be able to
look around me</i>

1284
01:24:26,968 --> 01:24:29,392
<i>to take in the meaning
of the landscape</i>

1285
01:24:33,197 --> 01:24:37,487
<i>Human beings make a
strange fauna and flora</i>

1286
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,608
<i>From a distance, they
appear negligible</i>

1287
01:24:40,728 --> 01:24:45,328
<i>Close up, they're apt to appear
ugly and malicious</i>

1288
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:50,789
<i>More than anything they need to be
surrounded with sufficient space</i>

1289
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:54,452
<i>Space even more than time</i>

1290
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:00,798
<i>The sun is setting</i>

1291
01:25:00,918 --> 01:25:03,788
<i>I feel this river
flowing through me</i>

1292
01:25:03,908 --> 01:25:06,525
<i>Its past, its ancient soil</i>

1293
01:25:06,645 --> 01:25:08,538
<i>The changing climate</i>

1294
01:25:09,114 --> 01:25:12,268
<i>The hills gently girdle it about</i>

1295
01:25:12,838 --> 01:25:15,959
<i>Its course is fixed.</i>
