<i>I had to trust that
there was a bigger reason</i>

<i>things were happening
the way they were.</i>

177
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,851
<i>And same for Jorge.</i>

178
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,772
<i>After all, he did make it past 20,
all the way to 30.</i>

179
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:47,109
<i>And he was just about
to meet his bigger reason.</i>

Lunch menus. Lunch menus.

181
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:10,340
- Menu?
- Yes, please.

182
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:14,011
- All right.
- Is this your first flight, sir?

183
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:16,930
Oh, no. It's like this every time.

184
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:20,809
- Deep breaths.
- Oh, I'm trying.

185
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,352

Sir.

188
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:34,489
Listen, is there anything I can do to
make take-off a little easier for you?

189
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,576
You could hold my hand.

190
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,994
(CHUCKLES)

191
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,914
It would make it a lot easier
for me to breathe

192
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,540
if you were holding my hand.

193
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:59,097
I think this might actually help.
There you go.

194
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:02,100
And how's that?

195
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,519
One small step in the right direction.

196
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:08,482
- Peanuts?
- Getting warmer.

197
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:11,526
Just... please.
Just... Just for take-off.

198
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,287
So, do you have a name, in case I need
to summon a medic or something?

199
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:23,830
Jorge.

200
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:25,666
- Jorge.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,001
Are you in Puerto Rico
for business or pleasure, Jorge?

202
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:29,211
- It's business.
- Business.

203
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,588

205
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,841
- What kind of business?
- Rum.

- Rum?
- Hm-hmm.

207
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,097
My father wanted to make sure
that we could handle our liquor

208
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,015
- before we went to college.
- OK.

209
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,394
Turns out that
rum is actually my favorite.

I did.

- Uh, just tonight.
- Oh. And how can I see you again?

You just like that Bolivar
is my favorite drink.

Of course I do,
but how can I see you again?

All right, Mr. Bolivar.

right in front of me.

- There will be plenty of girls, Chris.

what you're trying to say.

00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:30,429
"We, the Safety Patrol,
are here to patrol you"?

293
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:33,682

"Yo! What's up, guys?

to know how serious this.

No, absolutely, and I agree with you.
That's why I think maybe if you...

I mean, I love my family,

344
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:38,974
but it's just they're perfectly content
to stay in the same small town,

345
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,602
and I felt like I needed to get out
and see the world a bit

346
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:44,062
before, you know, I settled down.

347
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,273

- No.

No. I love that you...

I mean, you caught me by surprise.

355
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,087
Can you ask me
another question or something

356
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:11,924
so I can stop blushing like this?

Uh, yes, I do.

360
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,975
It's given me a much-needed
sense of independence.

361
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,811
Hmm. You feel free. I love that.

362

I tell my brother I love him every day.

onto some childhood dreams?

What? You're telling me that
you've never had childhood dreams?

know about it?

He's got a lot going on right now
and I'm finishing my senior year,

- Casual?
- Hm-hmm.

or a... me thing.

- Yeah.

Yeah. OK.

- I'm so sorry.

- No, you're so, so, so, so fine.

No. Helping people.

I don't know, I'm just happy
to be a part, honestly.

So, what was, like,
the deciding factor for you?

00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:51,470
there's actually a personal tie for me.

662
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:54,181
I'll preface it with this.

663
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,767
She's fine, thank God.

664
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:58,727
But, um...

665
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:03,857
Two years ago, my mom
was almost killed in a car accident.

666
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:06,944
She was driving to pick me
and my brother up from the airport

667
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,446
when some guy

668
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:12,074
coming home from a late night
crossed over the center divider

669
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,450
and hit her head on.

670
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:19,706
And she went into a coma and...
we didn't know if she was gonna make it.

671
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,920
We were sitting there waiting
and it just felt like forever.

672
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:28,632
And while praying for her to wake up,
I made a deal with the big guy,

673
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:30,551
that if she was OK,

674
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,347
then I would do whatever I could
to make sure other people stayed safe.

675
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:37,933
And so, here we are.

676
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,146
Wow.

677
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,317
That's a, uh...

678
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,279
That's a pretty deep layer, Sam.

00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:51,613

and his signature.

1380
01:29:36,635 --> 01:29:38,095
Read it.

1381
01:29:44,518 --> 01:29:46,853
"To whoever and his family.

1382
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:49,898
I understand I am
the recipient of a gift

1383
01:29:50,023 --> 01:29:53,360
from a relative of yours
that is beyond repayment.

1384
01:29:57,823 --> 01:30:01,076
I cannot imagine the grief
caused by your loss

1385
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:07,291
and there are no words anyone can say
or write to extinguish that pain.

1386
01:30:09,668 --> 01:30:15,632
Nevertheless, you have shared with me
the grandest gift I will ever receive.

1387
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:18,552
The gift of life."

1388
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:53,754
Grace.

1389
01:30:53,879 --> 01:30:55,297
Honey, come here.

1390
01:30:56,757 --> 01:30:57,841
What?

1391
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:59,676
Uh...

1392
01:31:00,636 --> 01:31:02,888
They gave Christopher a name.

1393
01:31:03,013 --> 01:31:04,598
What is it?

1394
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:06,850
Gabriel.

1395
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,730
The archangel of new life
and incarnation.

1396
01:31:12,773 --> 01:31:13,690
Our boy.

1397
01:31:14,858 --> 01:31:16,235
Their angel.

1398
01:31:16,818 --> 01:31:18,362
Gabriel.

1399
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:54,481
Gabriel was
their 19-year-old son Christopher.

1400
01:31:55,607 --> 01:31:57,818
He was in love with a girl named Sam.

1401
01:32:01,613 --> 01:32:03,282
The parents lost their son

1402
01:32:03,865 --> 01:32:05,826
and she lost her love.

1403
01:32:08,287 --> 01:32:10,205
He was just a boy, you know.

1404
01:32:14,835 --> 01:32:16,545
He was just a boy.

1405
01:33:58,146 --> 01:33:59,481
Chris is here.

1406
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:01,775
He's with me.

1407
01:34:13,453 --> 01:34:15,205
I'm going to take good care of him.

1408
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:17,124
Thank you.

1409
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:25,382
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Grace.

1410
01:34:25,507 --> 01:34:26,675
Hi.

1411
01:34:27,217 --> 01:34:28,719
LESLIE: Nice to meet you.

1412
01:34:58,624 --> 01:35:01,376
CHRIS: <i>Go ahead, take my eyes.</i>

1413
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:03,086
<i>They're no use to me now.</i>

1414
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:06,798
<i>But just know that when they look
at some little children playing,</i>

1415
01:35:06,924 --> 01:35:08,634
<i>I'll be smiling with them.</i>

1416
01:35:11,136 --> 01:35:14,306
<i>Take my heart so someone else
can live and love and...</i>

1417
01:35:15,182 --> 01:35:19,228
<i>with this gift, know that my love
remains in this world.</i>

1418
01:35:22,814 --> 01:35:25,400
<i>Take my lungs so someone else can sing.</i>

1419
01:35:26,652 --> 01:35:29,947
<i>And if you listen carefully,
you'll hear that I'm singing with them.</i>

1420
01:35:43,168 --> 01:35:47,172
<i>I'm sorry I didn't have more hugs
to give and jokes to tell.</i>

1421
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:50,717
<i>I did my best to make others smile.</i>

1422
01:35:53,011 --> 01:35:57,057
<i>And when I die, I won't be here.</i>

1423
01:35:58,267 --> 01:35:59,810
<i>I'll be everywhere.</i>

1424
01:36:12,864 --> 01:36:14,324
<i>So, that's my story.</i>

1425
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:17,452
<i>And it didn't happen the way
any of us would have expected.</i>

1426
01:36:18,495 --> 01:36:20,163
<i>But it was a miracle.</i>

1427
01:36:20,914 --> 01:36:23,792
<i>Beautiful, awesome and fantastic.</i>
