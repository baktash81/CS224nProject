1
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:23,657
Hélène, can you help me?

2
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,074
It's a lot.

3
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:32,199
They're enormous!

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,324
- Don't burn me with your cigarette.
- No.

5
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:38,990
There!

6
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,449
- Anne, you're going too far.
- Relax.

7
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:48,032
HAPPENING

8
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,949
Jeez! Wait.

9
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,240
Is that okay?

10
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:54,615
Watch out for your fingers.

11
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:01,990
And there we go.

12
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:03,282
So?

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,699
- You can't wear that.
- Why not?

14
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,490
It's not that shocking.

15
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:09,657
If I were a man,
I'd make love to me.

16
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:10,825
That's the problem.

17
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:13,574
- I didn't say I'd do it.
- No telling with you.

18
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,824
My turn.

19
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,074
Want me to tighten it?

20
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:18,657
Yes.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,657
You're crazy.

22
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:25,324
Hélène, you go next.

23
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:27,240
- No way.
- Yes way.

24
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:30,532
Done?

25
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:32,449
Like it?

26
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,365
- Isn't it a lot?
- Fine.

27
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,324
So Hélène, yes or no?

28
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:38,449
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

29
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,907
- People will see.
- That's the point.

30
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:43,157
- Come on!
- No.

31
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,282
So just one thing.

32
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:53,490
We'll do this.

33
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,033
You prefer this?

34
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,865
My shoes squeak.

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,074
It's all I hear.

36
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:04,532
- I love this music.
- Me too.

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,240
I hope it'll be crowded.

38
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,907
- We won't stay late?
- Don't worry!

39
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,615
Gabriel is playing the records!

40
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,199
There's a crowd.

41
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:19,949
Hurry up, girls.

42
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,240
Hey!

43
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,449
Lots of new people tonight.

44
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:04,074
He keeps looking at you.

45
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:08,824
He's not looking at me.

46
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,949
He's not bad.

47
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,740
I like men with ties.

48
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,865
Yeah but you like all men.

49
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:17,699
Look... you see?

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,490
He's your type too.

51
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,240
Careful!

52
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:35,032
Let me guess... Literature?

53
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,407
Easy, all girls do Lit.

54
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,865
That's an overstatement.

55
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,490
I'm doing History.

56
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,449
Oh yeah?

57
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:47,740
No, it's not true.

58
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:50,990
I'm in disguise.

59
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,199
They let us in, so I made an effort.

60
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:57,657
I came with those guys.

61
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,949
We're from the fire station nearby.

62
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,949
You're a fireman?

63
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:06,574
Is that a problem?

64
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:09,449
They say beware of fireman.

65
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,615
My conscience is clear.

66
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,240
Don't want to dance?

67
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,657
Buy me a Coke, Jean?

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,282
Sure.

69
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:27,865
A Coke, please.

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,699
Those girls really adore you!

71
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,574
They're just spying on me.

72
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,782
It suits them to think I'm a slut.

73
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:49,490
It's not true?

74
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:56,907
Those girls always dance
on their tiptoes.

75
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:58,865
They annoy me.

76
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:01,240
You're jealous.

77
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,782
Maybe.

78
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:09,490
<i>All that long day sitting at her mirror,</i>

79
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:12,365
<i>she was combing her golden hair, as if</i>

80
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:15,074
<i>in the midst of our tragedy.</i>

81
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:18,490
<i>She played a melody on a harp,
halfheartedly.</i>

82
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:21,449
<i>All that long day,
sitting at her mirror,</i>

83
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,907
<i>she was combing her golden hair, as if</i>

84
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,490
<i>she enjoyed tormenting her memory.</i>

85
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,240
Who'll take the plunge?

86
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,032
Come on.

87
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,740
Exams are soon.
It's hard to get into university.

88
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:37,365
Who wants to try?

89
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,615
Miss, please stand up.

90
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,865
What can you say
about this poem's hidden meaning?

91
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,157
I don't know.

92
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:57,199
We've already discussed Aragon.

93
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,782
Were you here? Physically, I mean?

94
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,282
Just try.

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,657
Answer, to be polite.

96
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:06,240
- Hear she's leaving?
- To get married, right?

97
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,699
A guy studying Math. A prick.

98
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,157
She's quitting?

99
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,615
At the same time, maybe it's better.

100
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:15,615
It means one less of us.

101
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,990
Disaster!
I'm afraid it'll just be you at the end.

102
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:20,449
Think you'll last?

103
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:21,824
Miss.

104
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,199
Tell me about the poem.

105
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,615
He uses a lover's drama
to evoke a national one.

106
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,365
It's a political poem.

107
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:41,907
Tell me about the recurrent imagery
in the poem.

108
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,490
Fire, tragedy, memory.

109
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,490
For me, they're war references.

110
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,865
In 1942,
when the poem was published,

111
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:56,532
Elsa Triolet and Aragon were communists.

112
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,782
So I think

113
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,615
they both hope
for a patriotic awakening.

114
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:02,758
Perfect.

115
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:07,199
What rhetorical device consists
of repeating words for emphasis?

116
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:08,824
Anaphora.

117
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:13,074
Anaphora.
You are too much!

118
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,115
Can I have some gum?

119
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,657
I'm all out.

120
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,907
- Brigitte, got some?
- Nope.

121
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,865
I'm so scared to flunk exams.

122
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,033
Me too.

123
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:48,699
They won't be easy!

124
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:51,574
My mind keeps wandering.

125
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,740
Wandering where?

126
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,990
If I don't pass these exams,

127
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,407
I'll be on a tractor next year.

128
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:02,907
- You'll help us study?
- Yes.

129
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,574
Of course.

130
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,449
Still nothing!

131
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:57,615
3 weeks

132
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:30,491
Hello!

133
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:32,907
You see the time?

134
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,449
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi.

135
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,282
What's wrong?

136
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:43,824
You're all pale.

137
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,407
I don't know.

138
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,615
- Pale as a ghost.
- Really?

139
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:48,907
Let me see.

140
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,324
I can't tell.

141
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,157
- Smallpox?
- Stop it, Maurice!

142
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,643
You may have a slight temperature.

143
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,282
Don't get sick on us now.
Lousy timing.

144
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,074
It's just hot out.

145
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,199
Feel it?

146
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,657
- Feel what?
- She feels warm.

147
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,407
- Nah.
- I said I felt fine.

148
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:14,866
So how's school?

149
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,782
Graduating, honorable mention.

150
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,950
Stop, Mom.

151
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:20,615
- It's not true?
- I didn't graduate yet.

152
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,990
Don't act modest.
We know you're gifted.

153
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:25,449
You're lucky.

154
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,740
Look at your hands.

155
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:30,574
They're all white.

156
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,574
They're not used for work.

157
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:36,990
They have me dyeing now.

158
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,657
At the factory. And so...

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,240
I don't recognize my hands.

160
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,532
I told Annie to spend the night.

161
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,282
I'll make your bed.

162
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:12,658
Here.

163
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,199
What?

164
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,365
Buy yourself a novel.

165
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:32,032
It's been three months, right?

166
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,115
Since your flu last winter.

167
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,490
You're a funny one.

168
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:42,282
You were so afraid to miss classes.

169
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,574
It's not always the case.

170
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:49,740
- It hurts here?
- Not only.

171
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,824
- What kind of pain?
- Like cramps.

172
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,949
Remove your underwear.

173
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,407
Bend your legs.

174
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,490
Are you late with your period?

175
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,282
- You've had sexual relations?
- No.

176
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:39,490
- Never?
- Never.

177
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:42,699
No boyfriend?

178
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,990
No.

179
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,324
You're pregnant, miss.

180
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,824
- I'm sorry.
- It's not possible.

181
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,865
I know what it means to you.

182
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,615
Do something.

183
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,990
You can't ask me that.

184
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,115
Not me, not anyone.

185
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,282
The law is unsparing.

186
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:19,282
Anyone who helps can end up in jail.
You too.

187
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,032
And only if you're spared the worst.

188
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,532
Every month, a girl tests her luck

189
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,907
and ends up dying
in extreme pain.

190
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,282
You don't want to be that girl.

191
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,115
It's not fair.

192
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,782
Maybe I won't carry it until term!

193
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,449
Maybe.

194
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:03,325
Anne!

195
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,865
So? Where were you?

196
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Upstairs.

197
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,990
Revising alone? You're sick of us?

198
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:24,282
What care you doing?

199
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,032
Working on conjugations.

200
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,824
"Agire," present indicative?

201
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:32,949
Ago, agis, agit,

202
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,365
agimus, agitis, agunt.

203
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,282
For me it's about the gaze.

204
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,324
I'm talking literally "eyes."

205
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,324
I don't know what you mean.

206
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:29,574
When Camus looks at us
his gaze pierces through us.

207
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,032
He inspires justice, humanity in us.

208
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,949
Sartre is more ambiguous.

209
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:39,574
Not grossed out?
How can you eat that?

210
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,657
You have to eat.

211
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,824
I can't. Take mine if you want it.

212
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:48,324
No thanks.

213
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,282
What about Sartre now?

214
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,907
I think he's hard to figure.

215
00:17:57,616 --> 00:17:59,365
And he backs the communists.

216
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:02,032
He backs Stalin,
denies the mass murders.

217
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,824
My dad's a communist,
never killed a soul.

218
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,949
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

219
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,865
No way! Who's eating my food?

220
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,324
No idea.

221
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:59,532
My stuff isn't on my shelves.

222
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,282
Unbearable!

223
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:08,532
Tupperware doesn't walk out on its own!

224
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
What now?

225
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,407
People keep stealing each other's food.

226
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,824
They take so long to wash.

227
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,282
Yeah, what a pain.

228
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:35,782
- Wash up, girls!
- Yes!

229
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,490
We won't have hot water.

230
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,615
Certificate of pregnancy

231
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:53,199
4 weeks

232
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,865
What about stretch marks?

233
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:57,532
No, I didn't get any.

234
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,074
You're lucky.

235
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,782
How about your legs?

236
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,740
Remember to put your feet up at night.

237
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,699
Miss Duchesne?

238
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,824
After you.

239
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,615
Can you check if we have them
for tomorrow?

240
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:22,490
- Yes, doctor.
- Thank you.

241
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:28,574
So...

242
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:34,240
Who recommended you?

243
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:35,990
I found you in the phone book.

244
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:40,240
Date of birth: September 1, 1940?

245
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:41,408
Yes.

246
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,990
I'll let you get undressed.

247
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,449
I live at the Cité Universitaire.

248
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,574
I study literature.

249
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,032
You know Charles Moreau?
A friend's son who studies there.

250
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:56,574
I think I've seen him around.

251
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:58,990
Remarkable young man.
He'll go far.

252
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:01,574
Go on now, please.

253
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,324
I'm pregnant.

254
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,240
I see.

255
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,615
I want to continue my studies.

256
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:21,740
It's essential for me.

257
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:24,157
Leave, we have nothing to discuss.

258
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,990
- Leave.
- I won't leave, you hear?

259
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:29,240
No scenes in my office.

260
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:30,699
So help me.

261
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
What is it?

262
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,449
It'll make you menstruate.

263
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,740
Are you sure?

264
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:53,741
Here.

265
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,324
That'll be 20 francs.

266
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,740
- This is all I have.
- Get going.

267
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:29,657
Open your books to page 35, please.

268
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,950
Look.

269
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:43,365
Be discreet.

270
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,365
What is it?

271
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,532
What do you think?

272
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,532
Think it's them?

273
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:56,990
I'm sure of it.

274
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:58,740
Hide it.

275
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:01,032
Bitches.

276
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:04,782
What's going on?

277
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:06,075
Nothing.

278
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:12,949
I want to kill them.

279
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:14,782
They're waiting for that.

280
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,574
A nice big scandal.

281
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:20,157
- Whatever you do, they'll complain.
- She's right.

282
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:26,907
I used to steal the dirty magazines
my brother hid in his guitar case.

283
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,157
How old were you?

284
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:29,615
I don't know.

285
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:31,157
10 or 11.

286
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,782
They taught me tons.

287
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,199
I can imagine.

288
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,282
I'm the most well-informed virgin
on the planet.

289
00:25:38,658 --> 00:25:42,157
I can't do much now,
but once I can, I won't be lost.

290
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:46,240
Wanna see something?

291
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:47,408
What?

292
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,450
Move it.

293
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,282
What matters

294
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:10,407
is this movement.

295
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,282
And the purpose

296
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,407
is to find a point that takes you far.

297
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:26,282
It can take time.
Ours are all different.

298
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,574
You need to take your time.

299
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:44,907
Like this.

300
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:53,865
I'm ready.

301
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,324
5 weeks

302
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,824
I hurt myself. Got a handkerchief?

303
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:30,657
I do.

304
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:33,158
Thanks.

305
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,240
It doesn't hurt?

306
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:57,199
Gaspard!

307
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:58,990
- Come on!
- Coming.

308
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,782
I'm getting tended to.

309
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,032
Thanks, gorgeous.

310
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,657
Look at your handkerchief.

311
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:17,907
There, That's all you got.

312
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,865
He's not bad, is he?

313
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,199
They all show off,

314
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:25,657
but if you end up at the fire station...

315
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:27,490
That's why I flirt.

316
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,240
They call me a tease,

317
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:31,782
but do I have a choice?

318
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,157
Every night I dream of going farther.

319
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:39,157
But you pick one,
and if he's the wrong one...

320
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:41,449
Then...

321
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,490
you end up pregnant.

322
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,115
No, anything but that!

323
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:49,199
It'd be the end of the world.

324
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,240
At worst...

325
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:53,657
there are methods.

326
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,824
What are you talking about?

327
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:58,615
If you don't want a baby.

328
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,699
Are you crazy?

329
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,324
Never say that, not even as a joke.

330
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:24,199
Bring home your dirty laundry?

331
00:30:56,575 --> 00:31:00,074
The accusative case,
used with a direct object.

332
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,032
The genitive case,
to show possession.

333
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,699
Next,

334
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,115
the dative case...

335
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,199
used with an indirect object.

336
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:14,824
And finally, the ablative case,

337
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,282
for attendant circumstances.

338
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:26,990
Write this all down.

339
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,282
Anne.

340
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,990
Are you making eyes at me?

341
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,532
Not at all.

342
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,490
Sure I'm not bothering you?

343
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,074
Anne, wait...

344
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,532
So?
Got something to tell me?

345
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:05,865
You know a lot of girls.

346
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:08,074
I guess you could say that.

347
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:13,615
You know one who did it?

348
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:17,782
What do you mean?

349
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,490
- Sex?
- No, not that.

350
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,282
I have a problem, Jean.

351
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,532
What?

352
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:34,324
- No.
- Yes.

353
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,282
I'm not keeping it.

354
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:43,407
You know one, right?

355
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:50,740
- Jean.
- Leave me alone, Anne.

356
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:02,157
- Stop.
- No.

357
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,532
Stop it, Anne.

358
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,407
So, who was it?

359
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:43,740
A man.

360
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,365
A man?

361
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,158
Elaborate.

362
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:55,115
I met him in a bookstore, downtown.

363
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,824
He was here visiting his aunt.

364
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,240
He's from Bordeaux.

365
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:01,615
Studying Political Science.

366
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,657
Political Science...

367
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,282
Not bad.

368
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,157
Does he know?

369
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,532
No.

370
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:16,449
Why not?

371
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,657
I don't know.

372
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,365
Where did you see him?

373
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:27,282
A little hotel. Near the train station.

374
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:30,575
Why?

375
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:32,325
Was it good?

376
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:36,699
I don't know.

377
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,907
Come on, tell me.

378
00:34:44,825 --> 00:34:46,574
Enjoy making love with him?

379
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,365
None of your business!

380
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,157
I swear, I'd never have thought...

381
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:02,865
you did that stuff.

382
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:04,324
Once.

383
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,365
"Once"... come on.

384
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:14,740
I shouldn't have come.

385
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:21,990
- Come.
- What are you doing?

386
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,865
Come here, kiss me.

387
00:35:24,283 --> 00:35:25,615
Stop, Jean!

388
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:28,615
Don't come near me.

389
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:31,282
There's no risk if you're pregnant.

390
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:07,824
What?

391
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:09,949
Why are you staring?

392
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:11,282
What's that?

393
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:14,490
You look diseased.

394
00:36:14,658 --> 00:36:15,907
A bug bite!

395
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:17,574
It could be syphilis.

396
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,699
Yeah, maybe.

397
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,907
Loose woman catch that stuff.

398
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:26,699
Listen, we don't want that here.

399
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:28,074
- Beat it.
- Wait.

400
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:29,490
Leave me the fuck alone!

401
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:31,699
Now comes the vulgarity, bravo.

402
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:35,074
Anne, there are rules here.
The same for everyone.

403
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:36,574
Understand?

404
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,449
Respect them or leave.

405
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,324
We know what you do.
You went out last night.

406
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,574
- Step closer and...
- And what?

407
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:46,115
Let me through.

408
00:37:56,408 --> 00:38:02,157
7 weeks

409
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:03,824
Camille Mazinc.

410
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,449
Fabienne Bray.

411
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:08,990
Very mediocre.

412
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,199
Madeleine Richard.

413
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Good job.

414
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:17,782
Mathilde Vogel.

415
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:21,365
Can do better.

416
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:23,490
Louis Couturier.

417
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:28,907
Disappointing.

418
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:31,824
Anne Duchesne.

419
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:41,740
Olivia Dubois.

420
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,824
Brigitte Ransom.

421
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:54,449
Professors usually recognize
other professors.

422
00:38:58,075 --> 00:38:59,657
I thought I knew you.

423
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:06,907
Say something.

424
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,574
So that's it? You'll...

425
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,574
fail your exams?

426
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,740
Yes, no?

427
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,740
So explain.

428
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,365
Your parents have problems?

429
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,199
- Is it money-related?
- Not at all.

430
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:39,699
So what is it?

431
00:39:50,783 --> 00:39:52,490
You won't talk.

432
00:39:58,325 --> 00:39:59,949
Your grades better improve.

433
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:25,533
Anne!

434
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:30,074
- Want to dance?
- I don't feel like it.

435
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:32,782
The music's great.

436
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,365
Come on.

437
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:49,240
Think I'm too close?

438
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,657
No, I'm good.

439
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:02,990
Excuse me.

440
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:05,407
I just want to talk.

441
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,157
Come for a walk.

442
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:29,782
Wait.

443
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,990
- Where are you going?
- We're just going.

444
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,115
- Leave her.
- Problem?

445
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:37,782
Don't get involved.

446
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,115
Leave her.

447
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:41,032
Leaving with him?

448
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,449
Didn't you hear? Butt out.

449
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:45,615
- Butt out.
- Stop it, Jean.

450
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:46,824
Come on.

451
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:49,324
Go back to your station.

452
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,532
Wait.

453
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:00,865
What are you up to?

454
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,240
- Got something to say?
- Anne, enough.

455
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:06,740
You're pathetic,
you have nothing to say.

456
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:08,782
Let's go home now.

457
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,657
What's going on?

458
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:20,282
We can all tell something's wrong.

459
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,115
No way!

460
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,240
What did you do?

461
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:38,615
- I'm not keeping it.
- Shut up!

462
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:41,282
What do I do?

463
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:44,074
Help me find someone!

464
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:46,824
- Where? How?
- It's not our problem.

465
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:48,532
Brigitte, come on.

466
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,782
Want to go to prison with her?

467
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,157
Do as you please, Anne.

468
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:00,865
It's none of our business.

469
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:06,199
Brigitte!

470
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,241
No.

471
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,657
Can you hear me? It's Lisa.

472
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,365
So how was last night?

473
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:16,074
Yeah? He mentioned me?

474
00:44:16,241 --> 00:44:17,241
Come on.

475
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:19,824
Does he think it
or is he just acting smart?

476
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,866
Wait a sec.

477
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:27,490
Are you sure?

478
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:30,365
I don't want to get it wrong.

479
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:35,491
Yes, of course.

480
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:45,740
I have to call you back.

481
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:47,657
I'll call soon. Take care.

482
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:51,074
Sorry, it's an emergency.

483
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:11,949
<i>Yes?</i>

484
00:45:12,116 --> 00:45:13,907
Bordeaux-7733, please.

485
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:15,115
<i>Hold the line.</i>

486
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:22,782
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Maxime?

487
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:24,491
It's Anne.

488
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:27,240
<i>What a surprise.</i>

489
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:31,115
Listen, I have something to tell you.

490
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:33,699
<i>Sounds serious.</i>

491
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,032
I'm pregnant.

492
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,865
Don't worry.

493
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,615
I don't intend to keep it.

494
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,824
That's the wrong sponge.

495
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:35,865
You're doing it wrong.

496
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:37,990
It's no good if it stays greasy.

497
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:43,865
Go study instead.

498
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:49,532
- Hear me?
- I don't feel like it.

499
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:52,365
Don't feel like it?

500
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:54,990
Who cares what you feel like?

501
00:46:55,825 --> 00:46:58,657
Can we afford
to do only what we feel like?

502
00:47:00,575 --> 00:47:02,615
Know what? Today I feel like...

503
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:06,907
sitting outside, in the sun,
tanning my legs.

504
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,407
The bar can wait.

505
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,115
Is this how you'll pass your exams?

506
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,032
What do you know about exams?

507
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,990
You left me no choice.

508
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:06,449
I don't approve,

509
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,282
but I understand your reasons.

510
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:14,115
Unwed mother.

511
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:16,032
It's not easy.

512
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,365
You're young.

513
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:21,907
A whole life ahead of you.

514
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,907
I'd like a child one day,

515
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:29,990
but not instead of a life.

516
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:33,657
I could hate the kid for it.

517
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,574
I may never be able to love it.

518
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:46,115
I wish I could have said it worked.

519
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:52,616
No.

520
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:54,615
I'm sorry.

521
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:56,949
The fetus withstood it.

522
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,615
There was blood.

523
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:02,532
Scratched mucus membranes.

524
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:11,157
I did everything.

525
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:13,283
Everything.

526
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:15,865
The shots.

527
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,032
The needles.

528
00:52:19,366 --> 00:52:20,657
What shots?

529
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:22,532
I saw another doctor.

530
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:25,365
He prescribed Estradiol?

531
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:26,533
Yes.

532
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:31,990
Most doctors are against abortion.

533
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,907
They don't think it's a woman's choice.

534
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,074
Estradiol strengthens the embryo.

535
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:51,199
Miss.

536
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:56,407
Accept it.

537
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:00,282
You have no choice.

538
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:05,782
9 weeks

539
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,449
I figured you changed your mind.

540
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:33,115
The train was late.

541
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:34,574
Not too tired?

542
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:36,199
I'm fine.

543
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:41,865
I'm glad you came.

544
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,407
What are you doing?

545
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:50,657
Hesitating.

546
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:53,490
I like this dress.

547
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:59,324
You'll see. My friends are great.

548
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:00,491
Funny,

549
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,574
charming, intelligent,

550
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:03,741
all of them.

551
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,365
His family are all lawyers,

552
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,282
and hers are all doctors.

553
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,532
Maxime.

554
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,365
I couldn't find a solution.

555
00:54:13,575 --> 00:54:14,782
What do you mean?

556
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:19,074
I thought...

557
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,824
That what?
I'd manage on my own?

558
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:30,407
How many weeks are you at?

559
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:31,782
Almost 10.

560
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:35,157
Is it too late?

561
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:38,990
No.

562
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,574
Max? Are you there?
You coming down?

563
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,199
We're coming down.

564
00:55:01,991 --> 00:55:03,407
Keep quiet.

565
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:28,115
Can you put some lotion on me?

566
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:32,240
Why are you smiling?

567
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,699
"Can you put some lotion on me?"

568
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:36,699
Pure Patrick.

569
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,407
You should put some on her.

570
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:40,740
It's all in the tone you use.

571
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:43,490
Your questions are like orders,

572
00:55:43,658 --> 00:55:45,157
but you get away with it.

573
00:55:46,825 --> 00:55:48,532
At school they envy your voice.

574
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,615
In Poli Sci,
a voice is a weapon.

575
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,240
They call me "Minister."

576
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:53,574
"Minister..."

577
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:55,657
You see yourself at the top.

578
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:57,157
President!

579
00:55:57,325 --> 00:55:59,490
You already see yourself
as Head of State!

580
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:01,782
Stop.

581
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:07,282
So Anne, tell us.

582
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,157
Tell you what?

583
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,740
Studying Literature?

584
00:56:11,908 --> 00:56:13,115
Yes.

585
00:56:13,366 --> 00:56:14,490
In Angoulême?

586
00:56:14,658 --> 00:56:15,824
That's right.

587
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:17,157
How will you manage?

588
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:19,115
Long distance is tough.

589
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,157
Are you grilling us or what?

590
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:22,782
Just asking.

591
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,449
Why are you so upset?

592
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:26,990
I'm not, but...

593
00:56:28,866 --> 00:56:30,074
I'm going swimming.

594
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:40,657
Wait for me!

595
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:43,907
Stop, you're going too far!

596
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:49,949
The current's strong.

597
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,574
- What's going on?
- Go away.

598
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:56,365
Anne, be sensible.

599
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:00,824
- This isn't funny!
- I said go away!

600
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,657
You came to punish me?

601
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,157
What exactly do you want?

602
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:14,907
Help. That's what I want.

603
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:17,657
You said you'd ask around.

604
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:18,825
I did.

605
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:19,991
Liar.

606
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:23,949
If you'd told me you were still...

607
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:27,365
You wouldn't have invited me?

608
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,282
When it's about having fun,

609
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,490
you're always there.

610
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:35,074
What can I do? I'm not a doctor!

611
00:57:35,783 --> 00:57:38,282
So it's my problem?
I manage on my own.

612
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:42,240
How will you get home?

613
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:45,490
As usual, I'll manage.

614
00:57:45,825 --> 00:57:48,699
If you leave now,
you'll never see me again.

615
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:51,574
I can accept your attitude
this afternoon.

616
00:57:51,741 --> 00:57:53,574
What my friends think now...

617
00:57:54,825 --> 00:57:56,615
Oh that, yes...

618
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:59,532
Friends are very important...

619
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:02,824
Just tell them the truth.

620
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,324
You all bore me.

621
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,824
Same old insolence.

622
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,574
Think that's how to solve
life's problems?

623
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,740
I solve them as best I can.

624
00:58:19,616 --> 00:58:21,449
What will you do about...

625
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,699
What do you care?

626
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:09,783
Get in.

627
00:59:19,075 --> 00:59:20,075
Miss.

628
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:23,533
Miss.

629
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:25,865
Continue.

630
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:27,282
Continue.

631
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:34,907
You can't?

632
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,950
No?

633
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:40,741
No.

634
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,699
Stand up so we can hear.

635
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:51,699
Tell me what was just said.
What are we discussing?

636
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:57,032
Make an effort.

637
01:00:01,325 --> 01:00:02,325
Nothing?

638
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:05,950
Nothing.

639
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,950
Nothing to say?

640
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,075
Why not?

641
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:16,199
I wasn't listening.

642
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:20,740
At least you're being honest.

643
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:25,949
Now let me be honest:
you may not make it into University.

644
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,158
Sit down.

645
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:44,239
10 weeks

646
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:17,491
Come here.

647
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:19,533
Come down.

648
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:42,574
What do you want?

649
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:43,990
Follow me.

650
01:02:58,866 --> 01:03:00,365
Laetitia will help you.

651
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:27,407
I'll give you a paper,
a woman's address,

652
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:28,949
Mrs. Rivière.

653
01:03:29,116 --> 01:03:31,032
She took care of me.

654
01:03:31,616 --> 01:03:34,782
Say "the girl from the paper" sent you.
She'll understand.

655
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,032
All right.

656
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:39,032
She's experienced.

657
01:03:39,491 --> 01:03:40,907
That's a plus.

658
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:44,699
Smile, please.

659
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:48,240
And it's clean.

660
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,490
She boils all the instruments.

661
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,032
Does it hurt?

662
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,490
Yes.

663
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,157
The whole procedure.

664
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:02,199
Try to think of something else.

665
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:04,407
The pain goes away.

666
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:07,532
I didn't end up in a hospital.

667
01:04:09,575 --> 01:04:11,074
It's the lottery there.

668
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:14,115
If you're lucky
it's labeled a "miscarriage."

669
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,990
But if some bastard doctor
writes "abortion",

670
01:04:17,158 --> 01:04:19,824
and you don't die,
you end up in prison.

671
01:04:22,866 --> 01:04:25,782
Excuse me, do you have a light?

672
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,990
Yes.

673
01:04:35,908 --> 01:04:37,907
- Goodnight.
- Thanks, goodnight.

674
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:46,907
Got money put aside?

675
01:04:47,075 --> 01:04:48,407
Is it expensive?

676
01:04:48,575 --> 01:04:49,740
400 francs.

677
01:04:50,075 --> 01:04:51,365
Up front.

678
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:57,865
I can lend it to you.

679
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:05,157
I'll manage.

680
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,199
It's fascinating.

681
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:35,949
- How much?
- 3 francs.

682
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:42,032
I'll take this one too for 5.

683
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,365
All right.

684
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:55,615
Bye.

685
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:10,782
Is this all your stuff?

686
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,950
Yes.

687
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,449
Why are you selling it all?

688
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,324
For a trip.

689
01:06:22,783 --> 01:06:24,074
Is it gold?

690
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:25,282
Yes.

691
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:29,157
I'm going to take it.

692
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,282
50 francs.

693
01:06:32,825 --> 01:06:34,324
It's worth a lot more.

694
01:06:43,908 --> 01:06:45,990
Hello, am I disturbing you?

695
01:06:47,325 --> 01:06:48,574
<i>Who is it?</i>

696
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,824
I was given your number.

697
01:06:52,741 --> 01:06:53,865
<i>So?</i>

698
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:58,490
It's urgent.

699
01:07:00,033 --> 01:07:01,033
<i>Monday at noon.</i>

700
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,824
<i>3, impasse Cardinet.
Last floor.</i>

701
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,699
A beer, please.

702
01:07:24,825 --> 01:07:26,449
- What do you want?
- Same.

703
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:27,616
Two.

704
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:30,824
Are you alone tonight?

705
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:32,241
Yes.

706
01:07:32,325 --> 01:07:35,532
Glad to hear it.
Your friends are awful.

707
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:38,907
Not awful. Frustrated.

708
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:43,157
Everyone here wants the same thing,
but won't admit it.

709
01:07:44,575 --> 01:07:45,990
And what do you think?

710
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,407
I don't care what they think, now.

711
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:54,032
But something's wrong.

712
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,615
You look strange. Are you sad?

713
01:08:00,241 --> 01:08:01,740
What's your problem?

714
01:08:05,991 --> 01:08:07,324
Solitude.

715
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,907
Like this?

716
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:00,366
Like this.

717
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:53,532
What do you want?

718
01:10:00,908 --> 01:10:02,490
What do you want, Hélène?

719
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:08,907
Last summer,

720
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:13,490
when I was back at my parents',

721
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,074
I had a relationship with a man.

722
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,907
It lasted a month.

723
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,782
He was much older than me.

724
01:10:47,616 --> 01:10:49,115
We made love a lot.

725
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:52,282
At his place.

726
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,240
In the barn near my parents'.

727
01:10:57,575 --> 01:10:58,824
Wherever.

728
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:01,865
Whenever we could.

729
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,407
I was ashamed,
but the desire was stronger.

730
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:17,949
I didn't get pregnant.

731
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:22,282
By chance.
I was just luckier than you.

732
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:35,157
Find the address you needed?

733
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:40,574
Listen, Brigitte's right.

734
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,449
Let's not discuss it.

735
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,115
It's better.

736
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,574
- You won't tell her?
- All right.

737
01:12:48,075 --> 01:12:50,365
I gave you cookies and applesauce.

738
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,282
Here.

739
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,615
12 weeks

740
01:14:24,325 --> 01:14:25,365
Yes?

741
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:27,657
The girl from the paper sent me.

742
01:14:30,283 --> 01:14:31,365
Come in.

743
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:42,490
Undress.

744
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,032
- Here?
- Yes.

745
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:19,532
12 weeks?

746
01:15:19,991 --> 01:15:22,032
That's right. Exactly.

747
01:15:22,408 --> 01:15:24,824
You already have a belly.
He's gotten strong.

748
01:15:25,491 --> 01:15:26,949
Is it still possible?

749
01:15:27,116 --> 01:15:29,032
Borderline, but doable.

750
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:32,990
Got the money?

751
01:15:58,283 --> 01:16:00,824
Bleed a lot
when you lost your virginity?

752
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,240
I think so.

753
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:04,615
Did you bleed a lot
or not a lot?

754
01:16:05,116 --> 01:16:06,365
A lot.

755
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:39,407
Some women use bleach.

756
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:42,115
Bleach in a uterus.

757
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:44,824
And they wonder why they die.

758
01:16:44,991 --> 01:16:47,199
You're lucky you found me.

759
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,740
Not a sound, not a shout,

760
01:17:03,908 --> 01:17:04,908
Understand?

761
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:07,282
The walls are too thin.

762
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,657
- Did you wash?
- Yes.

763
01:17:28,366 --> 01:17:30,574
Lie down, your hips on the edge.

764
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:40,907
- Like this?
- Further down.

765
01:20:22,408 --> 01:20:23,782
It's done.

766
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,574
Now you mustn't touch a thing.

767
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:38,407
At first, you'll feel the wand.
You'll get used to it.

768
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:44,240
How long will it take?

769
01:20:44,408 --> 01:20:45,949
Less than 24 hours.

770
01:20:48,491 --> 01:20:51,115
At first,
there'll just be a little blood,

771
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:52,865
then it'll come out.

772
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:02,699
Sir?

773
01:22:03,158 --> 01:22:04,657
I have something to ask you.

774
01:22:07,366 --> 01:22:08,740
You can always ask.

775
01:22:09,408 --> 01:22:11,449
I'd like the last lectures, please.

776
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:14,824
What for?

777
01:22:15,325 --> 01:22:17,115
So I can take my exams.

778
01:22:18,908 --> 01:22:21,449
- You're too far behind.
- I'll catch up.

779
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:24,449
Why the newfound interest?

780
01:22:25,366 --> 01:22:27,907
I wasn't able to study before.
Now I can.

781
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:30,865
You were ill?

782
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:35,157
The illness that strikes only women.

783
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,990
And turns them into housewives.

784
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:47,157
Do you still wish to teach?

785
01:22:47,325 --> 01:22:48,407
No.

786
01:22:49,325 --> 01:22:50,407
Why not?

787
01:22:50,575 --> 01:22:52,532
It's not what matters most to me.

788
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:54,157
What would that be?

789
01:22:56,408 --> 01:22:57,865
I want to write.

790
01:23:11,908 --> 01:23:13,032
Thank you.

791
01:24:45,116 --> 01:24:46,365
It didn't work.

792
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:56,240
I'm sorry.

793
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:10,950
So?

794
01:25:15,658 --> 01:25:16,865
There's nothing to do.

795
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,865
Maybe a second wand,
but it's a bad idea.

796
01:25:27,116 --> 01:25:30,699
The body's reacting poorly.
There may be complications.

797
01:25:39,283 --> 01:25:41,990
If you do it,
it's at your own risk.

798
01:25:50,783 --> 01:25:52,740
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

799
01:27:23,908 --> 01:27:24,908
What's wrong?

800
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:26,490
Leave me alone.

801
01:27:28,866 --> 01:27:30,699
Don't say a word, okay?

802
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:34,616
Okay?

803
01:28:11,658 --> 01:28:12,907
Are you there?

804
01:28:21,116 --> 01:28:23,199
Go get the scissors from my room.

805
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:04,699
I can't.

806
01:29:08,616 --> 01:29:10,199
I won't be able to.

807
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:18,949
Please.

808
01:29:20,616 --> 01:29:21,824
Me?

809
01:29:24,116 --> 01:29:25,365
Please...

810
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:43,407
Olivia...

811
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:50,282
Wait, wait.

812
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:04,490
I'm bleeding.

813
01:30:05,491 --> 01:30:06,574
You're bleeding.

814
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:08,365
Listen,

815
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:10,199
I'll go get a doctor.

816
01:30:10,533 --> 01:30:12,365
You must go to hospital.

817
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:16,907
This isn't normal.
We need help.

818
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:20,407
Stay with me. Look at me.

819
01:30:21,325 --> 01:30:23,699
Look at me, please.
Be strong. Anne!

820
01:30:28,658 --> 01:30:29,865
Help!

821
01:30:30,575 --> 01:30:32,032
I need help!

822
01:30:32,575 --> 01:30:34,240
A doctor, please!

823
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:36,407
It's Anne! In her room.

824
01:30:36,616 --> 01:30:37,657
Oh no...

825
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:39,491
Anne!

826
01:30:42,533 --> 01:30:44,407
I'm sorry, forgive me.

827
01:31:34,283 --> 01:31:35,990
What do I label it?

828
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,199
Miscarriage.

829
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:37,532
July 5th

830
01:32:37,658 --> 01:32:39,574
I'm scared.

831
01:32:40,033 --> 01:32:41,115
It's time.

832
01:32:42,033 --> 01:32:43,282
Good luck.

833
01:33:07,908 --> 01:33:09,615
We shall keep the honor.

834
01:33:09,783 --> 01:33:12,115
The rest, we shall give away.

835
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:14,365
And we walk.

836
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:16,949
Our eyes, indignant.

837
01:33:17,408 --> 01:33:19,824
Our foreheads, pale. On them, we read:

838
01:33:20,116 --> 01:33:23,240
"Faith, courage, drought."

839
01:33:24,075 --> 01:33:26,365
The troops continue their route

840
01:33:26,991 --> 01:33:30,240
Heads high, raising their flag,

841
01:33:30,408 --> 01:33:31,657
holy rags.

842
01:33:33,825 --> 01:33:37,157
I hope these words by Victor Hugo
will show you the way,

843
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:38,574
dear students.

844
01:33:39,616 --> 01:33:40,865
Take your pens.
