That was a joke, soldier. A joke.
[Laughs]

172
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,005
Uh, hey, Samuel.

173
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,679
- These kids.
- Yeah?

174
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,914
They're not normal. Right?

175
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:45,953
You didn't read the manual?

176
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,429
- Uh, no I... - Good. It's a bunch
of namby pamby stuff if you ask me.

177
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:50,759
Look,
here's what you need to know.

178
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,597
You're not the foster parent or
the caregiver. You're not the teacher.

179
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:58,136
You're just here to help the
kid have fun for one week.

180
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,299
Easy enough.
[Phone rings]

181
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,122
It's really not that hard if...
[Phone beeps]

182
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,944
You leave your life behind and
you focus on your camper.

183
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,481
Hey, Kaitlynn, what's up?

184
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,039
We got a nibble from Summerfield.

185
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,276
- Alright, let's seal the deal.

186
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,036
- And let's not forget
who's amazing idea this was.

187
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,191
Make it happen, alright?

188
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:18,917
- I want a raise.
[Phone beeps]

189
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:24,796
Don't let Tammie see that.
Come on, I'm gonna show you camp.

190
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:33,634
- Little R and R before the craziness begins?
- Yeah, I'm definitely a fan of that.

191
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,770
Pete here's an airline pilot most of the year
but this week he's in charge of the pool.

192
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,605
Right on man.
Swimming already huh?

193
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,842
Yeah, I like to open the pool for
the counselors before the kids get here.

194
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:46,283
- Great idea. I used to be a guard
myself in high school. - Really?

195
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,364
Yeah, yeah. Alright,
I'm gonna go get my trunks I think.

196
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,054
So what I'm thinking is...

197
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,491
- Hey, no cell phones.
- I'll just take it and put it over here.

198
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,760
- Hey, give me that back. Oh you girls
wanna play? Let's play. - Well.

199
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:02,495
[Screams - Splashes]

200
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:06,165

knows what he's gotten himself into.

[Screams - Splashes]

202
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,369
- Where'd you find this guy?
- Just keep an eye on him for me.

205
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,009
Eat up.
Only goes downhill from here.

206
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:28,182
This is better than
the chow they gave us in Baghdad.

207
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:29,689
He's joking, right?

208
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,492
It's amazing what you'll
eat when you're hungry.

209
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,796
- Hey Everyone!
Glad to see you're back.

210
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:37,806
These kids have had rough lives

211
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,237
and this is our opportunity
to share our hope, with them.

212
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:43,294
Couple quick reminders.

213
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,873
There are no cell phones
around the kids, Lacee.

214
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:48,407
Yeah. See,
all these new smartphones,

215
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,798
they're just a temptation
for the kids to steal them.

216
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,475
Bonnie, dress code.

217
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,708
- Okay.

218
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,483
One piece bathing suits
or cover-ups, ladies.

219
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:00,234
I don't want to see any
of that cleavage or crack.

220
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,260
[Laughter]
- Lacee.

221
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,557
Alright,
so without further ado,

222
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,317
the moment we've been waiting for,
camper assignments.

223
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,765
Tammie?
[Excited chatter]

224
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:11,317
Alright.
We've put a little bit of information

225
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:13,390
about each camper
on the back of the card.

226
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,303
Keep them with you as a reference.
- Redford! [Cheers]

227
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:20,072
- What's the big deal with Redford?
- Thinks he's an alien. Great kid.

228
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,577
Alright, we're dismissed!

229
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,563
Go get your cabins ready.
We're going to have a good week!

Alright guys.

234
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,213
I can't believe it's
already been a year. Right?

235
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,459
Ken!

[Mufï¬‚ed phone conversation]

- Come here,
we're going to say a prayer.

238
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,993
- Hold on, let me call you back.
[Phone beeps]

239
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:16,667
Let's pray that God helps us be a
blessing to the kids this week, right?

240

[Mufï¬‚ed prayer]
Not a praying man, huh Ken?

241
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:26,003
- Not exactly, no. - Well, you
might be by the end of this week.

245
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:40,381
You're going to love camp! There's a
pretty good chance that my friends,

246
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,692
the ones from out there,
are going to come.

247
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:47,597
You mean aliens? Like in Beasts Vs. Aliens?
They're disgusting.

248
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:48,532
- Loser.

249
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,069
Go away.

250
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,736
What are you going to do?
Bite me like a girl?

251
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,702
If I bite you, they'll
send me back, retard.

252
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,936
- Who you calling a retard?

253
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,343
- Don't make me use the Volcan death
grip on you. - You kidding me?

254
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,916
- Hey, there's camp!
[Excited chatter]

255
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,721
This place has a pool?

Hey, good to see you.

- Hi!
- Hi, are you Bella? I'm Bridgett!

260

- Can we go swimming?
- [Laughs] Yes!

261

- Are they sisters?
- Yes. Different foster homes.

- [Sighs] - They only
get to see each other at camp.

Are you Maribel?

Uh, yeah.

I'm your counselor, Lacee.

269
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,357
That's why I have this sign
with your name on it, silly.

Oh, yeah!
Silly!

a great week? Yeah, come on!

Yo, kid!
What's up, my man?

279

What the hell was that?

281
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,752
- Looks like
you got a runner, soldier.

282
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,587
Is anybody going to do anything?

283
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:00,163
We're wondering
the same thing about you.

284
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,892
- Pick it up, double time!

Hey. Honey, come on.
Let's get off the bus.

00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,135
Where are we?

288

Honey, we're at camp.

289
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,202
What is that?

290
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,546
They must not have told
her where she was going.

291
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,122
Oh.

292
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:54,249
Sweetheart,
you don't have to be scared.

293

Camp is a place for kids
to have fun.

294
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,561
Come on.
I'll walk with you.

295
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,462
Come on,
let's go have some fun, okay?

to contact the mothership.

297
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,233
- I don't think so, Red.

Come on!

301
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:35,383
Hey! Kid, you can't just
run off like that, okay?

302
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,921
I'm your counselor, do you
know what that means?

303
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:43,862
It means you have to listen to
me and do what I say, okay?

304
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,704
Alright, let's go unpack.

305
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,438
Kid, do you understand me?

306
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:55,951
I have a name.

307
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:58,948
Everyone has a name.
So?

308
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:00,252
I hate you.

309
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:04,519
- Look you're really starting
to push it, okay? - Hey, Eli.

310
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,352
I'm Samuel.
This is my buddy Redford.

311
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,660
Redford's been up here,
what, like uh, 3 times now, Red?

312
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:10,908
Yes, sir.

313
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,369
Tell you what,
we can go unpack now, or

314
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,172
we can go see the stump first
and unpack later.

315
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,136
- The stump?
Really? Sweet!

316
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,461
What do you say soldier?

317
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,507
Fine, whatever.

318
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,701
- Come on.

319
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,174
- Here,
camper's have been writing

320
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:40,254
their names on it
for over 25 years.

321
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,826
- My name's on it 3 times.

322
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,120
One for every year
I've been to camp.

323
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:46,493
Isn't it awesome?

324
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:48,464
I wouldn't go straight to awesome.

325
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,762
You can tell how old it is
by counting the rings.

326
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,338
There's this thick one up here.

327
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,297
Probably from when
the tree got burnt

328
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,252
from the second invasion
from Talus Prime.

329
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:00,312
You're weird.

330
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:01,313
Thanks!

331
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,643
Hey guys,
I see you found the stump.

332
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:05,844
And you must be Eli.

333
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,448
Welcome to camp.
You going to sign your name?

334
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,213
My counselor says
my name isn't important.

335
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:18,021
Okay.
Hey Redford, nice to have you back.

336
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,490
How has your year been?

337
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:23,328
Sad to report, no word
from the mothership yet.

00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:34,272
â™ª I've got joy like a mountain
in my soul â™ª

341
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:35,724
â™ª In my soul â™ª

342
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:40,025
â™ª I've got love like a mountain
I've got love like a mountain â™ª

343
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:45,711
â™ª I've got love like a mountain
in my soul â™ª

344
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,518
[Applause]

345
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,251
- Lame. - What are you
talking about kid?

346
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,051
That is quality entertainment.

347
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,096
Awe, thanks you guys.
Hey, we're going to be doing

348
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:58,169
a lot of singing this week
so I hope you're ready.

349
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,467
[Applause]

350
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:03,866
Remind me to tell you a story
about this guy

351
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,382
who was taken from his family.

352
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,570
He was in and out of prison

353
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,975
but God had a
special plan for his life.

354
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:14,986
And he ended up working for
the King of Egypt. [Woah]

355
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,256
I was taken from my sister.

356
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,486
- My dad's in prison.

357
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,621
Is this the Joseph in the bible?

358
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,929
I think we have some
announcements right now.

359
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:27,837
So, would you guys
help me welcome

360
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:29,945
Ms. Tammie,
our fabulous camp director?

361
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,493
[Applause]

362
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,770
- First the rules.
- [Awes]

363
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,368
Oh, we only have two.

364
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,612
Be safe, and have fun!
[Cheering]

365
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,280
[British accent]
And please do come to my tea party.

366
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,349
Tea parties are for girls.

367
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:50,116
Well, then I guess the girls are going
to get all the cookies.

368
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:54,617
- Samuel, how are we going to get cookies?
- We'll work something out.

369
00:23:54,749 --> 00:24:00,199
Oh, and a reminder, the variety show.
I want to see all your talents on the stage.

370
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:04,063
- Stupid kids. They don't have talent.
- Hey, be nice.

371
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,728
I think, um,
I think that's it, right?

372
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,499
- The pool!
- Swimming!

373
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,224
- Swimming!
- Pool! Pool!

374
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,436
What?
I, I can't hear you.

375
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,247
- The pool, that sounds like fun.
- Lame.

376
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,075
You're joking, right?

377
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:21,780
Oh! Okay.
Swimming!

378
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:24,627
Yeah,
Lifeguard Pete and I

379
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:26,787
decided there's not going to be
any swimming this year.

380
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:28,358
[Awes]

381
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,347
What do you think Lifeguard Pete?

382
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:32,718
- Hmm.

383
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:37,408
Go to your cabins
and put your suits on!

384
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,382
The pool is open!
[Applause]

385
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,506
Let's go guys!

386
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,338
[Chatter]

387
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,145
Hang on Redford, I got your
sunscreen right here buddy.

388
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:56,579
Alien snot, sweet! Doubles as a shield
against photon rays. Let's go!

389
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,423
Did you forget your swimsuit, stupid?

390
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:01,376
- No!

391
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:03,019
I just don't want to swim.

392
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:05,819
What's your problem?
You don't know how to swim?

393
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,767
- I can swim. - What are you?
Afraid of the water? Little chicken.

394
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:10,700
Shut up!

395
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,533
Bock! Bock! Bock!

396
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,867
Shut up!

397
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,402
I know why you really don't
want to go swimming.

398
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,237
That's enough, Amigo.
Come on, let's hit the pool.

399
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:22,242
- Sissy!
- Turd!

400
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:29,585
Look kid, it's alright that you're afraid
of the water. I was just teasing you.

401
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:32,351
I told you I'm not afraid of water.
Stop saying I'm.

402
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,087
What's your problem?

403
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,242
You.

404
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,086
[Laughs]
Funny.

405
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,452
- Find your swim trunks, let's go.
- Don't touch me!

406
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,134
Woah, woah.

407
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,354
Look,

408
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:46,970
all the other kids, are down
at the pool having a good time.

409
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,325
Don't want to miss out
on that do you?

410
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:49,584
Go to hell.

411
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,109
Get your swim suit on now
and let's go. - [Spits]

412
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:55,710
You serious kid?

413
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:01,952
Alright guys listen up.
There's only one way to get this arm band.

414
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:07,258
You have to swim all the way across the
deep end without any help whatsoever.

415
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,725
So, who's going to be the few,
the brave?

416
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,765
Who's going to join the ranks of
Pete's Ultimate Camp Swim Club?

417
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,008
You can do this.

418
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,188
I'm not sure.

419
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,636
I will be cheering for you
the whole way.

420
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:21,902
- But what if I don't make it?
- You totally will.

421
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,056
You are so strong
and I will be waiting for you

422
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:25,667
on the other side
when you finish.

423
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,479
[Chattering]

424
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,385
Ready?

425
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:36,820
You're not going to let me drown,
are you?

426
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,818
Not in my pool.

427
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:43,796
Now, on the count of three.

428
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,123
Okay Bella.

429
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,263
- Ready?
One.

430
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,039
Two. Three. Yeah!
[Cheering]

431
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,145
- Go Bella!
- Come on Bella!

432
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:05,880
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

433
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,450
- Yes! Yes!
- Yay Bella!

434
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:28,438
Welcome to Pete's Ultimate
Camp Swim Club! [Cheering]

435
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,903
I've never won anything before.

436
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,876
I'm so proud of you!

437
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,413
You got it girl!

438
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,113
Hey Ken.

439
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:39,006
- Hey.

440
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,563
For the free planets of the
delta quadrant! [Splash]

441
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:46,419
- Oh my gosh!

442
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,260
[Splash]

443
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:58,261
- You got it.

444
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,738
- I almost made it.

445
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,709
Just keep working on it with Samuel.
You'll get it.

446
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:12,908
- Where's Eli?
- I told him to stay at the cabin.

447
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,884
- What?
- You left him alone?

448
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,747
The kid spit on me,
okay?

449
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,453
Whatever.

450
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:33,198
[Splash]

451
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,943
There you are.

452
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:42,743
Okay, the three of us
need to have a talk. - Fantastic.

453
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:46,218
Someone here needs to apologize.

454
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,903
It's me.

455
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:54,591
I really wanted you to come to camp, Eli,
but we were short a counselor.

456
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:59,358
So, Ken, even though he doesn't know
how to be a good counselor,

457
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,784
he came up to fill in.

458
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,264
It's okay,
I always get screwed.

459
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,162
Okay.
So how about this?

460
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,981
No spitting,
stick together,

461
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,183
and camp will be great!

462
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,108
Fine.

463
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,855
I hear there's
a kickball game happening.

464
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:23,436
Why don't you two go down
and play before dinner?

465
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,521
Don't leave him alone again.

466
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,838
[Cheering] Alright Redford, let's
get on base buddy! Let's go!

467
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,940
Who's up? Oh, I think it's me!
[Laughs]

468
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:54,881
Kick that sucker to Zenith!

469
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,213
[Cheers]

470
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,098
Nice!

471
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,634
[Claps - Cheering]

472
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,141
- Eli, you're up!
- Eli's up!

473
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,650
Alright Eli, come on!

474
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:42,427
- Out!
- What the hell, I was safe!

475
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,194
Sorry Eli,
you were out.

476
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:46,839
Come on, it's no big deal.
You were out.

477
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,975
Figures you would take their side.
Who's counselor are you anyway?

478
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:51,567
Get off the field, kid.

479
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:54,805
I told you, you were out.
Even your counselor says so.

480
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:56,765
[Grunts]

481
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,200
[Panting]

482
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:09,071
I'm going to count to five
and you better be down here.

483
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,657
Do you understand me?

484
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,090
I know how to count to five.

485
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:15,209
Well alright then. Here we go.
One.

486
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:17,178
Two.

487
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:18,769
Three.

488
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:21,055
Four.
- Five!

489
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:26,070
Fine! Stay up there. See if I care.
I got all night.

490
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,718
[Chattering]

491
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:45,428
- Hey soldier.

492
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:53,031
Serellian wamba beast liver!
Yes! I'm starved!

493
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,736
Kid, you can't run off
like that, okay?

494
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:58,078
I was hungry.

495
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:02,646
Wow! You swam all the way
across the deep end?

496
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,113
Isn't she awesome?

497
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,739
Hey,
I want one of those.

498
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:07,670
Sorry kid.

499
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:11,139
Only brave little boys who can swim
and obey their counselor get one.

500
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:14,152
Hey, maybe you should
trade your phone in for one.

501
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:16,364
You know, the one
you've been texting on all day?

502
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:17,350
Give it up, kid.

503
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:20,527
Come on, get me one! What kind
of a stupid counselor are you?

504
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,831
Look, you want an arm band?
You have to swim, okay?

505
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,342
[Under his breath] Can't believe I have to put
up with this food for the next four days.

506
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,636
Bon appetite!

507
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,681
They look like alien brains and fingers
mushed up all together!

508
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:41,253
That's disgusting.

509
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:43,352
- Can I have some?
- [Laughs]

510
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,126
- Did you look through your other bag?
- Like three times! Man, where is it?

512
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:55,935
- Hey Samuel, here to relieve you.
- Jimbo.

513
00:32:56,524 --> 00:33:00,472
Well, as soon as you guys get settled in
your bunks, we can start the story time.

514
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:03,404
Sweet!
Do you have any UFO stories?

515
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:06,172
Hey, kid, what's that whole
mess you're making up there?

516
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,250
Alien defense.
I don't want them

517
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,983

and sucking out my intestines.

518
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:12,243
I see.

519
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,582
- Ready for a story now.

520
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,590
- Here it is!
It's in Eli's bag, he took it!

521
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:21,891
Whatever,
you probably just put it there.

522
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:25,463
- Why did you take it?
- He's always taking stuff at Locustwood.

523

Not again, man,
I'm getting tired.

526
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:35,269
- Let's go soldier,
double time!

527
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:40,311
[Door closes]
- Is it safe to come out yet?

528
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,778
- [Reading] There we are, said
Mrs. Puddleduck, good as new.

529
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:51,421
[Reading] She opened the shutters and let
the warm sunlight spill into the cozy room.

530
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:55,288
[Reading] Charlotte could smell the
roses growing in the garden just below.

531
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:58,892
[Reading] Mrs. Puddleduck looked
lovingly at Charlotte and said,

532
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,168
just come to me every day and let me
remind you how much I care.

533
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,435
- Alright, story time is over.
Time for bed.

534
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,712
- No, no!
I don't want to go to bed.

535
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,674
Can we read another story,
please?

536
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,363
No, we're going to have
a long day tomorrow.

537
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,891
You've got to get some sleep.
Come on, into bed!

538
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,475
I'm not tired, can we go
for a walk, Bridgett?

539
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,350
- Uh.
- Please?

540
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,696
You, almost fell asleep
on the ï¬‚oor, Bellie Boo,

541
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,876
and I can barely
keep my eyes open myself. Come on.

542
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:33,523
No, no! I don't want to go to bed.
Let's stay up, please, please!

543
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,910
- It's okay. It's okay Bella.
Bella, it's okay.

544
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,940
Bella, you're safe here. You're okay.
Nothing is going to hurt you.

545
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,771
He'll come here too.
He will.

546
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:54,278
Uh, Bridgett, can you move
your bed next to hers?

547
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,065
Um, yeah.

548
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:04,626
How about that? Look, she's going to put
her bed right next to yours.

549
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,494
Look how close.
Better?

550

[Snifï¬‚es]

551
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,966
My magic blanket!

552

Magic blanket?

553
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,033
Almost forgot that I brought it.
Okay.

554
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,075
My great grandmother made it.

555
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:23,838
It's pretty.

556
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,785
Come here.

557
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,909
My grandma made this,
not only with stitches and cloth,

558
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,576
but with all of her love.
Here.

559
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,419
Read what it says.

560
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:42,095
- Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

561
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:48,096
Guard me Jesus through the night
and wake me with the morning light.

562
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:55,774
You know, I don't really use it that
much anymore. You want to borrow it?

563
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,777
- Really?
- Mmm hmm.

564
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,190
It is magic.

565
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,201
- Just leave me alone.

[Footsteps]
I give up.

567

Ken, go!

568
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,053
These are the only shoes they sent Gabby
up with and they're two sizes too small.

569
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,147
I let her borrow my ï¬‚ip ï¬‚ops.

570
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:40,852
I'll have Pete go in to town
first thing. Size?

571
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:42,158
Five.

572
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,497
[Door opens]

573
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:45,656
- So it begins.
- Yeah.

574
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,757
- Sam. - Randy took
Bryce's stuff over to Cabin five.

575
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,296
What'd the nurse say
about the bite?

576
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,200
Thankfully,
it didn't break the skin.

577
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,774
What about those two?
What are you thinking?

578
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,409
I hate to admit I was wrong.
I should have known.

579
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:03,913
Eli's social workers wanted us to
send him back if he got violent.

580
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:05,781
I'm going to have to
send them both back.

581
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:07,079
Give them one more day.

582
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:12,784
I can't risk the entire camp for them.
Look Sam, a lot can happen in a day.

583
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:16,121
[Door opens]
Then he runs again, yeah.

584
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,824
Yeah, I think she gave me the
worst kid here on purpose.

585
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,657
Hey, I got to go but as soon as you
get that meeting you let me know.

586
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,104
Okay? Alright, bye.

588
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,446
So, how was your first day?

589
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,803
Thanks for the troubled kid.
What's wrong with him?

590
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,171
Nothing.

Nothing?

[Door opens - Door closes]

593
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:51,227
- Is there anything here but junk food?
- There's some apples in the fridge.

594
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:52,798
- Excellent.

595
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:06,270
So, what's up with your freak kid?
Uh, Robert.

596
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:09,759
Redford.

597
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah, seriously?
What's that kid, like 10 years old?

598
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:15,054
He's already in some need
of serious therapy.

599
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,629
You know, I wonder if these kids here
wouldn't benefit more

600
00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:21,082
from a bunch of psychos
rather than us. Right?

601
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:22,958
The first day can be pretty hard.

602
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,416
Yeah, no kidding!
My kid had me run probably

603
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,256
20 miles
around this place today.

604
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:30,895
It's going to take a month's worth
of chiropractic work to fix my neck.

605
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,569
Hey Randy, how long did you say
you've been doing this again?

606
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,936
Three years.

607
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,039
Glutton for punishment, huh?

608
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,744
You know, I thought
you had the worst kid, but

609
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:45,308
obviously Tammie
has it out for me.

610
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,681
- You know what I thin...
- Time to go!

611
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,792
Hey man, take it easy!

612
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:59,082
- Don't "easy" me! Now you listen
and you listen good, maggot.

00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,836
You may be good at making money
in your pretty little office

614
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,945
but, I have been
to hell and back.

615
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:07,905
I've killed in service and I've watched
my buddies bleed to death from IED's.

616
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,106
Camp, is a walk in the park compared
to war you non contributing zero.

617
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,584
When I think back to my army
days it gets me all worked up.

618
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,037
Believe me, when you're under fire
in a war zone

619
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,572
you think of the oddest things.

620
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:31,846
Wayne,

621
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,908
was the only person who
told me he loved me,

622
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,232
ever.

623
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:39,830
Wayne?

624
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,501
My counselor,

625
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,863
from this camp.

626
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:54,144
I was a mean,
violent, nasty kid.

627
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,883
Hated everyone,
especially Wayne.

628
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,180
Must have bit him
like 20 times.

629
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:03,337
And when I
left camp,

630
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,770
he told me he loved me.

631
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,462
And I spit on him
when I got on the bus.

632
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,824
Tried to find him
when I got out of the service.

633
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,775
He had died the year before.

634
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,956
Never got a chance to tell him

635
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,006
thanks for changing my life.

636
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,187

if you don't like the food,

637

639
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,932
You will figure out a way to be
a good counselor to that kid.

You get me?

641
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:48,340

I don't know.

They made me come here.

and the food is worse than Locustwood.

- Time to get up, princess.

You might want to try something else.

Where's my phone?

You're not supposed
to have a phone.

No.

- Are you sure
you haven't seen it?

Oh, here it is.

00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:55,486
That might be a problem see, cause we
can't leave until you change clothes.

679
00:43:55,949 --> 00:44:00,091
- Seriously kid, we're all boys. It doesn't
matter if we see each other in our underwear.

680
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:01,633
Eli, come on.

681
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:05,898
Hold on a second, Sam.

682
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:21,216
What do you think?

683
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,488
Fine, whatever.

684
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:29,016
Alright then. Hurry up.
Come on, find your pants.

685
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:34,526
All the good fishing spots
are right out here.

686
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:41,439
There's gonna be some really great
crawdads right over there, okay?

687
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:47,205
If you're waiting for it to dry
it's going to be a long wait.

688
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:02,891
You find any leeches,
soldier, you let me know.

689
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,120
Leeches?
Seriously?

690
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,558
They'll be attached to your toes.

691
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,900
Leeches, great.

692
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:28,953
[Woah] Oh, looks like you got one soldier!
That's what I'm talking about.

693
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:35,152
See this crawdad, they look like these
creatures I've seen on my home planet.

694
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,660
This is your home planet,
stupid.

695
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,254
No it isn't.
I'm from Zenith.

696
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,993
Don't call me a liar.

697
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:46,595
Mm, mm, mm. You've insulted
Zenithians for the last time!

698
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:48,432
[Struggles]
- Hey, come on guys.

699
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,031
- Woah, woah, woah!
[Splash]

700
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:51,097
[Laughs]

701
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,644
[Screams]

702
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,104
Good one, Ken!

703
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:57,577
I like the new look!

704
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:58,988
Oh, you haven't heard?

705
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:03,552
Mud does good things for your complexion.
Come on down, I'll show you.

706
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:07,457
No, no. Thanks, I'm good.
Are the crawdads biting?

707
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,001
Oh yeah, they're definitely
some kind of alien creatures.

708
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:13,912
They like raw meat.
[Nom, nom, nom]

709
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:15,684
[Chatter]

710
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:20,068
- Oh bacon!
- I've never seen so much bacon!

711
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:26,357
- So, Bella and I are going to go
to aunt Tammie's tea party.

712
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:29,224
What do you think kid?
Want to join them?

713
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,293
What?

714
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:35,275
- The tea party's for girls.
- Right.

715
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:37,819
Eli, want to go swimming today?

716
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:39,715
I already told you, no swimming.

717
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,353
Hey, the water's not
going to hurt you.

718
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:43,192
Besides, you know,
it's hot out. Take a dip in th...

719
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,594
No swimming, okay?

720
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:45,957
- Okay.

721
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,463
Okay, mister party pooper.

722
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:50,699
We'll just stay in the cabin
all day and do nothing.

723
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:52,179
Sound fun?

724
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,583
[Phone beeps]

725
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,945
- Tum it off, put it away,
keep it away.

726
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:07,448
Look, I've got an important
prospective client.

727
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,955
It could be worth a lot,
so...

728
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,459
Okay. Well,
remember Eli, your camper?

729
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:12,888
He's important too.

730
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,469
I know.

731
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:18,747
I'm aware I suck at this, okay,
but I'm trying to do better today.

732
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:21,025
We did the whole
get in the mud thing.

733
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,274
You're mean to him.

734
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,327
He's mean to me.

735
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,956
- He's ten!
- So!

736
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,044
Put the phone away
and maybe

737
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,984
you'll be able
to keep track of your camper.

738
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:47,024
[Chatter]

739
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,524
Remember? We've got to
stick together, alright?

740
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:10,236
[Cheers - Splashes]

741
00:48:10,237 --> 00:48:13,343
Sure sounds like the kids are having
fun over there at the pool, huh?

742
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,634
You know,
I used to be a lifeguard.

743
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,919
It would be like you had
your own personal,

744
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:21,118
lifeguard.

745
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:24,214
I told you,
I'm not afraid of water.

746
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,193
Well you know what, that's sure
what it sounds like to me, kid.

747
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:28,563
I'm not a liar!
I hate you!

748
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:53,387
Here, let me help you.

749
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,681
No, no, no, not like that.
Can't you ju...

750
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,317
- I've just never done it before.
- It's not that hard.

751
00:48:58,318 --> 00:48:59,619
Can't you just take
the arrow and pu...

752
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,794
- I've never done it before.
- Neither have these kids either, okay?

753
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:04,401
You know what,
just forget it!

754
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,166
[Chatter]

755
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,063
Wow!
I want to ride the bikes!

756
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:17,181
We can ride the bikes.
Let's go check it out.

757
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:18,567
No we can't.

758
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,887
Sure we can.
There's plenty left.

759
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,529
Look, there's a purple one right there, you
want that one? It looks about your size.

760
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:27,125
I don't know how.

761
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,597
What do you mean?

762
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:31,663
They said
I'm too fat to ride one.

763
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,859
Gabby,
do you know what today is?

764
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:39,197
What?

765
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,208
Today's the day you're gonna
learn how to ride a bike!

766
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,336
Really?

767
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,431
Uh huh!
Let's go!

768
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:46,069
Can we grab that one please?

769
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,701
Alright, come on.

770
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,637
Got it?

771
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:54,346
Alright, you got this.

772
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:56,515
[Crash]
Gabby. You okay?

773
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,311
[Giggles]

774
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:00,368
- Gabby!

775
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,925
- I'm okay!
- Oh, good.

776
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:05,622
- Can I try again?
- Of course you can, come on!

777
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:28,139
Look,

778
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:31,484
kid. I didn't mean t...
- Whatever, okay?

779
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:37,691
Okay, okay. You don't want to swim,
you don't like archery,

780
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:41,322
you don't want to go to the tea party.
What would you like to do instead?

781
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,526
Shoot, anything.
I'm up for it, tell me.

782
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,268
I want to go
to the other side of the lake.

783
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,262
- I don't think
they allow that, kid.

784
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:53,213
Why don't we do something
back here at camp, okay?

785
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,473
Figures.
You said it but you don't mean it.

786
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:56,936
That's not fair and you know I...

787
00:50:56,994 --> 00:50:58,241
You said it!

788
00:50:58,528 --> 00:51:00,407
You just lie
like everyone else.

789
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,719
We should go back to the cabin now.

790
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,625
- Look what I got!
Made from alien skin.

791
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:10,614
Pretty sure he swallowed
half the pool, but he made it!

792
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,919
Hey, let me see that.

793
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:13,656
- No, it's mine!
- Hey.

794
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:15,767
That's not a nice way to
treat a fellow soldier.

795
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:18,963
Can we just go back to the cabin now?
I hate it here.

796
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:23,901
Back to the cabin.

797
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:28,874
Figures, I get the kid that wants
to do something we can't even do.

798
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:30,366
He wants to hike a mile away.

799
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,147
Where?

800
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:37,555
Come on. Looks like we're
going for a hike now.

801
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:39,955
Ugh!

802
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,573
Why don't you try to talk to him?

803
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:02,107
Yeah, I don't really feel like going for
a hundred yard dash again,

804
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,182
but thanks.

805
00:52:04,864 --> 00:52:08,334
- Why do you think he runs?
- Because he likes being a pain?

806
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,136
Try again, soldier.

807
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:14,784
Man, all I know is
he's testing my patience.

808
00:52:15,295 --> 00:52:16,978
He is testing you

809
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:19,527
to see if you give
a damn,

810
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:22,031
because no one else does.

811
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,688
How's it going?

812
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:48,090
I just want to get away
from that stupid camp.

813
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:49,655
Yeah, no kidding.

814
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,101
Think you're right about the tea party,
that would be pretty lame.

815
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:57,057
Sounds lame. What do they
even do there anyway?

816
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,041
I don't know.
We'd have to go to find out.

817
00:53:00,462 --> 00:53:02,262
They do have treats though.

818
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:05,399
Yeah, but you've got to dress up.
Girl stuff.

819
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,917
It sucks
not having an arm band.

820
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:13,951
Yup,
gotta get into that pool.

821
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:19,115
You know, you could really get me
one if you wanted to. You suck.

822
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:22,625
[Whispers]
Hopeless.

823
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,929
You know what, kid?
[Thunder cracks]

824
00:53:25,713 --> 00:53:27,042
Come on.
Up.

825
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,863
- Finally! The mothership
has come back for me!

826
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:35,220
Take me home!
Take me home!

827
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:38,187
Take me home!
[Thunder cracks]

828
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:48,673
These mountain storms
pass quickly.

829
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,696
It'll be sunny again tomorrow.

830
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:54,130
That's the closest
the mothership has come yet.

831
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,239
Sucks, huh soldier?

832
00:53:58,956 --> 00:54:01,699
They'll come back for me,
someday.

833
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:05,099
Why don't we check our mail?

834
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,164
Hey,
did I get a letter from my dad?

835
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,705
Got something here
from Tammie for you.

836
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:19,149
No thanks.

837
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,289
Alright, here you go Bella.

838
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:27,323
Here you go Maribel.

839
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,322
You can open those, Maribel.

840
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,892
I'm saving them.

841
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,067
You'll get more tomorrow,
go ahead and read them.

842
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:37,768
I don't like reading.

843
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,743
Don't like reading?
Uh.

844
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:43,868
Everyone likes
reading their letters.

845
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:47,634
[Whispers]
Lacee.

846
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:50,773
Maybe she's not that good at it.

847
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,062
What?

848
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:53,673
[Mouths]
Reading.

849
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:55,971
Oh.

850
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:03,423
Maribel, can we talk?

851
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,961
What grade are you in
at school, sweetie?

852
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,371
My mom, my mom didn't
like taking me to school.

853
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,811
I have an idea, can I
read your letters to you?

854
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:33,772
"Dear Maribel, You rocked it
on the kickball field today soldier.

855
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:36,790
You can be on my team anytime.
Sergeant Sam."

856
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:39,721
Read this one.
- Okay.

857
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,964
"Dear Maribel, You are so much fun
to hang out with here at camp.

858
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:48,393
Tomorrow,
we get to do the tea party."

859
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:49,453
[Laughs]

860
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:52,537
"You are going to be so beautiful
in one of the dresses.

861
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:54,736
I can't wait to see
which one you pick.

862
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,982
I'm so lucky to have you
as a camper this week."

863
00:55:58,204 --> 00:55:59,859
You wrote that one!

864
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:02,737
- Yeah, I did. Do you want
to read more? -Yeah.

865
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,996
Red, turn that thing off
and go to sleep soldier.

866
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:18,226
- I can't find my alien band.
- You're not supposed to take it off.

867
00:56:18,558 --> 00:56:20,265
It was itchy.

868
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,407
Here it is!

869
00:56:26,406 --> 00:56:27,832
- No, uh, wait!

870
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,478
That one's not yours.
I found it.

871
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:34,082
What do you mean you found it?

872
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,024
- Wait a minute.

873
00:56:36,442 --> 00:56:40,488
You took my alien band
because it's made of alien skin

874
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,142
and you want to be
an alien, like me. Admit it.

875
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:48,596
Look, there's no such
things as aliens you freak.

876
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:49,114
Guys!

877
00:56:49,154 --> 00:56:52,301
No mothership, no Zenith,
and we eat spaghetti for lunch,

878
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:56,963
not alien guts.
No one is ever coming for you.

879
00:56:57,298 --> 00:57:00,008
Never, ever, ever.

880
00:57:02,095 --> 00:57:03,204
Ow!

881
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:05,476
Hey, what are you doing?
Huh?

882
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,646
- Hold this, sweetie.

883
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,118
How do you feel?

884
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:19,160
I've had worse.

885
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,730
Well, you certainly took it like a champ.

886
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:31,400
Samuel, is it true?

887
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,571
What's that?

888
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:36,341
The aliens aren't coming for me.

889
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,845
Hey, you don't give up hope, you hear me?
Don't give up hope.

890
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:54,864
You and these stupid arm bands. Why
can't you stop taking what's not yours?

891
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:56,069
I didn't.

892
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:02,841
Oh really? Well somehow it magically
ended up on your bed then. I wonder how.

893
00:58:04,831 --> 00:58:07,778
Nothing to say huh?
Yeah, figures.

894
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,574
You know, with all your running away
and stealing things,

895
00:58:13,068 --> 00:58:16,794
you're making me look like
a bad counselor.

896
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,487
That's because
you are a bad counselor.

897
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:24,927
No, you know what?
You are bad, you.

898
00:58:28,116 --> 00:58:29,304
[Door slams]

899
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:31,981
[Sighs]

900
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,990
- Let me exp...
- Just wait here.

901
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,947
So when do I go back?

902
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,590
We can't have kids
beating other kids up.

903
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:53,029
You understand?

904
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:02,792
Ken hasn't been
the best counselor, huh?

905
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:05,164
Ken's the worst counselor ever.

906
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:09,869
Okay.

907
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,043
Tell you what,

908
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:14,366
I'll give you a second chance

909
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:17,346
if you think you can give Ken
a second chance.

910
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,642
Okay.

911
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,563
Good. Come on,
get in bed. Up.

912
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,296
Up, up, up.

913
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,588
Ms. Tammie.

914
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:33,707
Yup?

915
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:38,062
Will you tell Redford
I'm sorry.

916
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,837
I will.
Goodnight Eli.

917
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:50,498
[Phone beeps]

918
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:53,377
- Well, when's he going back?
- What?

919
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:56,952
- When is he going home?
- Shh! Ken.

920
00:59:59,412 --> 01:00:00,516
Is that what you want?

921
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:02,772
Tammie, If we're not careful
I may end up gett...

922
01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:05,289
we may end up getting sued
by Redford's parents.

923
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:10,295
What parents Ken? His dead mom
or his drug dealer dad?

924
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:13,462
You know, look. You can't just throw out
right and wrong okay?

925
01:00:13,535 --> 01:00:16,904
The kid has broken every single rule
and there need to be consequences.

926
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:20,136
In Eli's world, right and wrong,
they tend to get a little bit muddled.

927
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:24,543
And if the adults in his life can't tell
the difference, how can we expect him to?

928
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:28,182
Alright so forgive me if I have a
little bit of compassion here.

929
01:00:28,306 --> 01:00:29,663
But please, don't you worry.

930
01:00:29,728 --> 01:00:33,781
Nobody's going to complain
that Eli's counselor doesn't give a care.

931
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:38,618
I'm trying to care,
Tammie.

932
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:42,696
But that kid
is totally screwed up.

933
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:48,707
I can't do this.

934
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:51,667
I mean,

935
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:53,872
how do you like
a kid like that?

936
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:02,202
You just have to find
one thing to like.

937
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:04,042
Just one thing.

938
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:06,468
And pray for him.
- [Scoffs]

939
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:08,892
All these kids
could use our prayers.

940
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:11,268
Alright, okay.

941
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:14,745
Well, for example,
there's one thing I like about you.

942
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:17,789
Really?

943
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,368
- Porsche Carrera 4.
- [Laughs]

944
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:32,107
330 horsepower, 0-60 in 5.2 seconds.
Be still my beating heart.

945
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:36,184
Nice. Girls don't like boys,
they like cars and money.

946
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,221
Okay,
goodnight Ken.

947
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:39,652
Goodnight.

948
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,457
And Joseph told his brothers,
who had sold him to be a slave,

949
01:01:44,857 --> 01:01:46,491
that what they meant
for evil,

950
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:50,094
God used for good
for his entire family.

951
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:52,075
Amen.

952
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:53,235
[Amens]

953
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,829
Well, my friend Pete has an announcement
to make, so Pete, would you come on up.

954
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:59,035
[Applause]

955
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,473
Great news!
Yesterday at the pool,

956
01:02:02,563 --> 01:02:05,418
four more campers joined
the hundred year tradition

957
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:08,348
of Pete's
Ultimate Camp Swim Club!!

958
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:09,887
[Applause and cheers]

959
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:14,083
So, if the club is 100 years old,
how old does that make you?

960
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:15,590
[Laughter]

961
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,325
Please stand
and raise your bands high!

962
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,385
[Applause and cheers]

963
01:02:21,888 --> 01:02:24,767
- Way to go guys!
- Really good!

964
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:34,169
- Can you get me one of those arm bands?
- You know I can't.

965
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:37,737
Buy one, steal one. You could do
it if you were a good counselor.

966
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:41,473
[Sighs]

967
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:45,715
- Come on, I want to show you something.
- [Singing] - We can't just leave.

968
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:47,767
[Whispers]
Who's going to stop us?

969
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,008
â™ª ... we like fun â™ª

970
01:02:50,817 --> 01:02:58,360
â™ª It's great just knowing I'm a part of
God's family, playin' under the sun â™ª

971
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:03,553
- This is your car?! No way!!
- Yes way.

972
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:08,907
- You wanna get in - Yes!
- Come on, hop in, dude.

973
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:17,930
Whoa!

974
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,887
How did you get this?

975
01:03:22,014 --> 01:03:26,485
Well, I didn't steal it, or trick someone.
I worked really hard for it.

976
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:29,327
If you want something bad enough,
you'll do almost anything for it.

977
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,064
- You really want that wrist band, right?
- Yea.

978
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:42,444
Look, I may be a lousy counselor,
but I'm a great swimmer.

979
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:46,138
And I can teach you to swim across
that pool faster than anybody.

980
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,618
- But, I don't want to swim
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

981
01:03:49,028 --> 01:03:51,455
and you aren't afraid of water,
blah, blah blah.

982
01:03:51,598 --> 01:03:53,790
We only have a few days left
here at camp

983
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,526
and it's going to take time for me
to teach you how to swim.

984
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:57,922
So what are we going to do?

985
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:02,630
Eli.

986
01:04:08,301 --> 01:04:09,768
Let's be honest.

987
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:12,881
We don't really like each other
or get along too well, do we?

988
01:04:14,734 --> 01:04:17,400
But there is one thing
I like about you, dude.

989
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:20,913
You're a fighter.
A real fighter.

990
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:26,509
And if you really want that wristband,
you're going to have to fight for it.

991
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,424
Whatever is keeping you out of
the water... you've got to fight it.

992
01:04:35,087 --> 01:04:37,033
[Laughter and splashing]

993
01:04:56,475 --> 01:05:00,582
Hey. Give me your towel.
Just go for it.

994
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:24,295
Hey.

995
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:31,240
On three we jump in
together, okay, Eli?

996
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:33,789
Okay.

997
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,588
One. Two. Three.

998
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:40,628
[Splash]

999
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,063
Come here. Come here.

1000
01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:57,272
Whoa!

1001
01:05:59,772 --> 01:06:02,116
[Splashing, laughing and yelling]

1002
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:20,678
[Sighs]

1003
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:30,303
Fancy.
[Laughter]

1004
01:06:34,874 --> 01:06:38,845
- The tea party's this afternoon.
- That's what I hear.

1005
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,259
[Sigh]
Did you know?

1006
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:51,037
You know... um...
about Eli?

1007
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,233
I try not to think about
their past too much.

1008
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:00,876
I focus on a hopeful future.

1009
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:05,811
[Door shutting]

1010
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,339
Hey you!
You were awesome in the pool today!

1011
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:13,818
I think you won,
like, every chicken fight?

1012
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,686
Hey, why are you
wearing that dress?

1013
01:07:15,816 --> 01:07:17,816
[British accent]
Oh, I'm going to a tea party.

1014
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:20,254
I know, I know,
it's just for girls.

1015
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:23,415
- Okay, well we are off.

1016
01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:27,898
Enjoy your tea party.

our right hand over your left hand.

1185
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:42,152
Okay,
here you go.

1186
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,949
One, two. One, one, two.
Take a stab at it.

1187
01:17:48,847 --> 01:17:50,622
Not bad, man.
Not bad.

1188
01:17:54,019 --> 01:17:55,657
You know my mom is dead?

1189
01:17:57,356 --> 01:17:58,562
Like your dad?

1190
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:03,872
No, I didn't know that.

1191
01:18:06,998 --> 01:18:08,636
She was the meanest person.

1192
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:12,011
She never let me go out
of my room.

1193
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,999
She wanted to be
with her boyfriends.

1194
01:18:14,059 --> 01:18:16,242
She made me hide
when they came over.

1195
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,650
She didn't like it when I talked
to other kids. She hated me.

1196
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:22,118
Well, I hate you mom,
I hate you!

1197
01:18:22,214 --> 01:18:24,337
[Sobbing]
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

1198
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:27,519
Hey it's okay.

1199
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:31,230
He's uh,
he's just a little upset.

1200
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,596
- Hey Eli.

1201
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:37,597
The other kids are making s'mores.
Wanna come get some?

1202
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,439
What are s'mores?

1203
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:44,600
[British accent] - Oh they're just
the most delicious dessert.

1204
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:47,182
All marshmallows
and chocolate all melted together.

1205
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:49,249
They're really quite exquisite.

1206
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:52,085
- Sure.
- Come on.

1207
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,458
Yeah, yeah,
go on, go on.

1208
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,099
I wanna go
for the armband tomorrow.

1209
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:04,988
Yeah.

1210
01:19:06,148 --> 01:19:07,448
You're gonna get it.

1211
01:19:07,603 --> 01:19:08,695
No problem.

1212
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:15,253
I..., I have to help out
with the s'mores, but um,

1213
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:17,545
this is for Porsche.

1214
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:41,371
[NO dialogues]

1215
01:19:53,138 --> 01:19:55,641
Are we gonna get in
trouble being out here?

1216
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,416
- I won't tell if you don't.

1217
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:00,782
[Laughs]

1218
01:20:01,947 --> 01:20:06,123
So, you were pretty obsessed
with me in high school, huh?

1219
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,023
[Sighs]

1220
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,827
I mean you did buy my
old drums from my mom.

1221
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,198
Your mom donated them!

1222
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:15,252
You kept them.

1223
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:18,035
Well I did like your band.

1224
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:22,778
Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what
you thought of me that night!

1225
01:20:23,702 --> 01:20:28,845
I should have been ï¬‚attered, I..., why did you
ask me out on stage? In front of everybody?

1226
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,410
Okay, because my friend
dared me to do that.

1227
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:35,222
Yeah, and you could have let me down
a little bit, you know, smoother.

1228
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,418
Yeah, that wasn't one of my
classier moments, was it?

1229
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:43,165
Well, I do hope that me
giving you are ride in my car tonight

1230
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:45,871
helps to sooth some of those
high school wounds.

1231
01:20:46,658 --> 01:20:47,834
It doesn't.

1232
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:53,432
- You want me to tell you what does?
- Yeah, please do.

1233
01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:55,372
You teaching Eli how to swim.

1234
01:20:56,535 --> 01:20:57,673
He really likes you.

1235
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,887
So what happens next?

1236
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:12,582
You mean when he goes back
to his world

1237
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,158
and we go back to ours?

1238
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:19,963
- Yeah. No.
- It's hard.

1239
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:21,697
So what do you do?

1240
01:21:22,594 --> 01:21:24,301
I pray that God
will watch over them.

1241
01:21:25,897 --> 01:21:27,706
Yeah. Not me.

1242
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,340
Not you?

1243
01:21:33,772 --> 01:21:36,902
I prayed.
When I was a kid.

1244
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:39,604
I asked Him for things.

1245
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,523
- And he didn't answer?

1246
01:21:46,551 --> 01:21:48,326
No, no.
He answered.

1247
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,696
He let my dad die.

1248
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,365
He didn't save him from cancer.

1249
01:21:59,898 --> 01:22:01,400
I'm sorry.

1250
01:22:04,936 --> 01:22:07,246
Yeah, I haven't talked
to God much since then.

1251
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:11,453
- God can love us no matter
what our situation.

1252
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:15,615
That means, it's whether
we can feel it, or not.

1253
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:17,983
And that's what
you tell these kids here?

1254
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,327
I hope you're right about Him.

1255
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:27,228
Me too.

1256
01:22:39,104 --> 01:22:41,710
Do you want
to get into some more trouble?

1257
01:22:42,507 --> 01:22:43,693
Come on.

1258
01:22:46,511 --> 01:22:47,587
Hey Roy!

1259
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:49,527
This isn't what it looks like.

1260
01:22:50,482 --> 01:22:51,984
Yes it is!

1261
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:54,425
I don't even want to know.

1262
01:23:01,826 --> 01:23:02,929
[Splash]

1263
01:23:04,162 --> 01:23:05,369
[Cheers]

1264
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:06,834
Keep kicking!

1265
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:12,641
[Cheering]
- Come on Eli!

1266
01:23:22,213 --> 01:23:23,856
- Yeah!
[Cheers]

1267
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:30,097
You did it! You did it, Eli!
That was amazing!

1268
01:23:31,156 --> 01:23:32,676
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

1269
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,925
I'm so proud of you, kid.
Really.

1270
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,767
See, you're a real fighter.

1271
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:39,025
Dad?
- Hey!

1272
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:40,679
Get your hands of my kid.

1273
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:42,034
Who's this guy
and wha...

1274
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,579
Get your damn hands
off my kid!

1275
01:23:43,668 --> 01:23:44,823
No, dad,
I didn't mean for you to come.

1276
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:46,823
Shut up boy, you called me.
I'm taking you home.

1277
01:23:48,873 --> 01:23:50,393
Bonnie, get the kids out of here, now!

1278
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:55,975
- Let's get him to the nurses station.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1279
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,554
- Keep touching him
and I'll kill you!

1280
01:23:57,582 --> 01:23:59,061
- Shut up, dad!
Shut up!

1281
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:01,407
- Somebody call the cops.

1282
01:24:01,464 --> 01:24:02,568
Get off me!

1283
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:08,496
- Hey Jenny.

1284
01:24:10,562 --> 01:24:13,198
What's going on here?
What happened?

1285
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:15,073
His father showed up.

1286
01:24:18,203 --> 01:24:19,204
Hey.
You okay Eli?

1287
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,442
Just leave me alone.

1288
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,044
- You don't have to be embar...
- Just leave, just leave.

1289
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:28,054
Okay, buddy.
I'll be outside, alright?

1290
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,520
- It's going to hurt a little bit, okay?

1291
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,629
Anybody want to tell me
what that was about?

1292
01:24:33,752 --> 01:24:35,959
- He's pushing you away.
- What?

1293
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,510
We're friends.
I mean...,

1294
01:24:38,577 --> 01:24:39,757
I don't get it.

1295
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,134
I have to call Locustwood.

1296
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:43,158
I wanna know, how did he
even know he was here?

1297
01:24:43,261 --> 01:24:46,299
- I don't think it was Locustwood.
- What do you mean?

1298
01:24:46,564 --> 01:24:48,168
He said something about Eli calling him.

1299
01:24:48,299 --> 01:24:50,973
Eli can't call him.
Eli doesn't have access to a...

1300
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,589
Three thirty in the morning?

1301
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,024
Do you know this number?

1302
01:25:11,956 --> 01:25:14,095
No, no I don't know
that number.

1303
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,662
See, this is why we don't
allow cell phones here.

1304
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,671
Huh, how do you know
Tammie's aunt?

1305
01:25:20,832 --> 01:25:21,936
What are you talking about?

1306
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,073
- Margaret Summerfield.

1307
01:25:23,126 --> 01:25:25,471
You've got a bunch
of missed calls from her.

1308
01:25:25,837 --> 01:25:28,215
She's a huge financial
supporter of our camp.

1309
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:32,221
Why is my aunt calling you?

1310
01:25:36,014 --> 01:25:39,299
She's umm... she's been in the market
for a new financial advisor,

1311
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,194
and I found out that she's...

1312
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,425
No. No, just...

1313
01:25:44,022 --> 01:25:46,002
Tammie, Tammie.

1314
01:25:50,161 --> 01:25:53,802
Hey. Hey. Wait a minute.
Let me expla...

1315
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:57,039
Are you serious?! That's why
you wanted to come to camp?

1316
01:25:57,836 --> 01:26:03,115
You used me. You used these kids.
For my great aunt's money?

1317
01:26:04,843 --> 01:26:06,686
Look, I did not come to camp initially...

1318
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,614
- Well,
it looked worse than it was.

1319
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,285
No stitches
so he should be good to go.

1320
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:15,563
Hey buddy, look.
You got your arm band.

1321
01:26:16,688 --> 01:26:17,802
It's your fault!

1322
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:24,367
- Go follow him!

1323
01:26:25,803 --> 01:26:26,839
No.

1324
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:29,029
No.

1325
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:32,579
This isn't right.

1326
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:36,474
What did you expect, huh?

1327
01:26:37,182 --> 01:26:41,008
That years of pain would somehow
magically disappear in a week.

1328
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:43,081
That you could fix him
in a couple of days?

1329
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,064
So your just going to
give up on him now, huh?

1330
01:26:52,493 --> 01:26:53,498
Great.

1331
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:57,232
- My fish is going to be bigger
than your entire head.

1332
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,468
It's going to jump out of the boat.
- Mine's going to be bigger.

1333
01:26:59,564 --> 01:27:01,874
Ours is going to be bigger.
[Engine revs]

1334
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,497
Come on.

1335
01:27:14,879 --> 01:27:16,256
Hey, look who made dinner.

1336
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,395
Where's Ken?

1337
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,807
We haven't seen him.

1338
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:25,824
Good.

1339
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:31,637
We'll keep an eye on him.

1340
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:36,378
Hey sweetie,
you don't want to lose this.

1341
01:27:38,236 --> 01:27:40,512
Eli.
You want something to eat?

1342
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:46,385
Look, Eli, Bothean tree worms.
Delicious and nutritious.

1343
01:27:46,778 --> 01:27:47,950
Shut up, freak.

1344
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:56,823
Do you want to do anything, Eli?
It's our last activity for the week.

1345
01:27:57,217 --> 01:27:58,330
- No.

1346
01:27:58,516 --> 01:28:01,794
Crawdads, canoes?
What do you say, soldier?

1347
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,369
I wish I never came.

1348
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:05,440
Come on, chin up.

1349
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:11,174
[Truck backing up beep]

1350
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,814
Camp Pine Lake, are you
ready to have a party?

1351
01:28:19,945 --> 01:28:23,258
Because my friend Eli's never
had a birthday party before

1352
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:27,460
and I thought today would be
a great day to celebrate it.

1353
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:30,163
What do you think?

1354
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,829
[Cheers]

1355
01:28:31,943 --> 01:28:33,276
You came back?

1356
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:34,969
Happy Birthday, Eli.

1357
01:28:35,326 --> 01:28:38,535
It's my birthday?
It's my birthday party!

1358
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:40,605
Hey Red,
this is my birthday party!

1359
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,722
And what would a birthday party be
without presents?

1360
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:44,962
Presents?

1361
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:47,274
Here's one for you, Luke.

1362
01:28:47,538 --> 01:28:49,882
Oh, wait,
and here's one for Bella.

1363
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:50,952
Yayl!

1364
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:53,545
- And Redford
- Sweet!

1365
01:28:53,678 --> 01:28:55,021
And for Gabby...

1366
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,258
A bicycle!

1367
01:28:57,341 --> 01:28:58,772
And for Jose.

1368
01:28:59,075 --> 01:29:00,592
Oh you know what?
Wait a second,

1369
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:03,960
I think I have birthday presents here
for everybody!

1370
01:29:04,322 --> 01:29:05,358
[Cheers]

1371
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:08,336
And something
extra special for Eli.

1372
01:29:12,697 --> 01:29:13,869
They go with the drums.

1373
01:29:14,732 --> 01:29:16,871
Drums?
Are you serious?

1374
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:21,642
[Song: Sun Sunny Sun

1375
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:27,216
Happy birthday, buddy.
Happy Birthday.

1376
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,218
[Cheering, laughing, party sounds]

1377
01:29:38,603 --> 01:29:39,980

1390
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:54,270
It's been a pleasure serving
with you this week, soldier.

1391
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,202
Feels a lot longer than that.

1392
01:30:58,169 --> 01:31:00,046
- Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

1393
01:31:01,772 --> 01:31:04,116
They've had more than enough
of that in their lives.

1394
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,853
Oh, and uh.

1395
01:31:13,512 --> 01:31:15,176
Bring your shades.

1396
01:31:30,134 --> 01:31:32,842
Well, I guess
I can't put this off forever.

1397
01:31:41,012 --> 01:31:46,655
Don't cry, soldier. The mother ship will
come soon and I'll be able to go back home.

1398
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,561
- Hey, Mandie?
- Yeah?

1399
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:57,034
I think I forgot to be sad this week.

1400
01:31:57,728 --> 01:32:00,038
- That's good!
That's so good.

1401
01:32:00,364 --> 01:32:03,538
Here. Bridget helped me
write this letter for you.

1402
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:18,451
Hey kid.

1403
01:32:20,758 --> 01:32:21,763
You okay?

1404
01:32:23,688 --> 01:32:24,691
No.

1405
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:31,469
Am I going to see you?
After I leave this place?

1406
01:32:36,033 --> 01:32:38,536
Uh. I don't know.

1407
01:32:41,072 --> 01:32:43,712
Can you promise me we'll
see each other again?

1408
01:32:46,244 --> 01:32:47,746
I can promise you one thing.

1409
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:50,990
I'll never forget you.

1410
01:32:57,622 --> 01:32:59,260
I love you, Eli.

1411
01:33:03,094 --> 01:33:06,473
I'm going to ask God to watch out for you.
You understand?

1412
01:33:08,232 --> 01:33:10,610
- Okay kids, on to the bus.

1413
01:33:10,968 --> 01:33:12,028
- Okay,

1414
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:14,945
get on the bus.

1415
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,527
[Saying goodbyes]

1416
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,181
- Bye sweetheart!

1417
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:48,539
- Keep your head up!

1418
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:58,456
- Bye guys!
- We love you.

1419
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:01,588
- I love you, Bella!

1420
01:34:06,324 --> 01:34:07,392
Bye!

1421
01:34:19,637 --> 01:34:21,514
You miss Lacee, huh?

1422
01:34:23,007 --> 01:34:25,385
It's okay,
where are you going?

1423
01:34:25,509 --> 01:34:27,819
West County Home
for Girls.

1424
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,983
I've been there once.
It's not so bad.

1425
01:34:32,263 --> 01:34:35,545
They have a really nice playground.

1426
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,256
It's okay.
Here, take this.

1427
01:34:39,316 --> 01:34:44,202
You'll get your own next year,
but until then, you can borrow mine.

1428
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:45,429
Thanks.

1429
01:35:01,512 --> 01:35:04,049
We had the best counselors.

1430
01:35:04,515 --> 01:35:07,458
My favourite part of camp was
when we got caught in the rain.

1431
01:35:08,063 --> 01:35:10,063
What was yours?

1432
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:11,688
The drums.

1433
01:35:11,689 --> 01:35:13,464
That was sweet too.

1434
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,164
- Hey Red?
- Yeah?

1435
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:20,538
Tell me about your home planet.

1436
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:23,351
Well,
I come from the Planet Zenith

1437
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:26,262
where everything's made of gold
and everyone is purple.

1438
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:31,201
The diameter of the planet
is 63 miles by 63 miles.

1439
01:35:31,314 --> 01:35:33,698
If you think about it, it's like...

1440
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:49,105
- Hey.
- Hey.

1441
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,714
So the counselors bus
is getting ready to leave

1442
01:35:53,774 --> 01:35:55,895
and I still have
some cleaning up to do.

1443
01:35:56,233 --> 01:35:58,440
Would you mind giving me
a lift off the mountain?

1444
01:36:01,972 --> 01:36:03,918
You did really great this week.

1445
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:06,784
Seriously, thanks for coming.

1446
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:13,966
Tell me.

1447
01:36:19,824 --> 01:36:23,203
Well, I've started
talking to God again.

1448
01:36:25,129 --> 01:36:29,635
And, I've been asking Him why
He lets them suffer like this.

1449
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:33,375
I ask the same thing
all the time.

1450
01:36:34,605 --> 01:36:35,609
- And?

1451
01:36:37,475 --> 01:36:41,082
And I don't know. I mean maybe
He can use the suffering for good.

1452
01:36:41,278 --> 01:36:44,748
Like he used Jesus' suffering
to help all of us.

1453
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:47,823
And that makes you feel better?

1454
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:52,828
No.
But it gives me hope.

1455
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:59,005
Well, I was hoping for
a little bit more than hope.

1456
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:07,800
It's hard to go back.

1457
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,721
- Yep.

1458
01:37:11,146 --> 01:37:14,987
For the whole week, I couldn't wait
to go back to my real life, you know?

1459
01:37:15,266 --> 01:37:16,289
And uh,

1460
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:19,589
now I... feel like

1461
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:22,952
my real life is fake,
and camp is real.

1462
01:37:24,555 --> 01:37:25,693
Kinda weird.

1463
01:37:26,824 --> 01:37:31,330
Man, that kid could run.
You know? He could run.

1464
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:39,476
Will I ever see Eli again?

1465
01:37:44,909 --> 01:37:46,115
Pray for him.

1466
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:25,854
[Door buzzing]

1467
01:38:44,468 --> 01:38:46,971
Not quite so intimidating
when I'm sober, huh?

1468
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:01,121
Eli writes me letters.

1469
01:39:02,152 --> 01:39:03,502
Talks a lot about...

1470
01:39:04,259 --> 01:39:05,688
camp and...

1471
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,970
his counselor.

1472
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,640
When you become a dad,
you uh...

1473
01:39:18,769 --> 01:39:21,113
The thing is, I...

1474
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:31,445
The only example I had
was my dad,

1475
01:39:33,502 --> 01:39:37,026
and he didn't exactly
help me out. You know?

1476
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,490
Hey, it's okay.

1477
01:39:45,329 --> 01:39:47,785
No, it's not okay.

1478
01:39:48,805 --> 01:39:50,282
It's not okay!

1479
01:39:51,368 --> 01:39:53,075
I'm a failure as a father!

1480
01:39:54,304 --> 01:39:56,292
Eli's going to have
no dad to help him out.

1481
01:39:56,352 --> 01:39:58,816
He's going to get screwed
just like I got screwed.

1482
01:40:05,649 --> 01:40:06,992
I talked to my attorney.

1483
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:11,589
He wrote this up.

1484
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:22,404
I know it's...
it's a lot to ask.

1485
01:40:27,404 --> 01:40:29,406
Eli doesn't have a lot of options.

1486
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:29,535
Working with real family kids
is not

1487
01:41:30,091 --> 01:41:31,761
like a typical

1488
01:41:32,036 --> 01:41:33,005
camp.

1489
01:41:33,029 --> 01:41:34,419
A lot of these children feel

1490
01:41:35,143 --> 01:41:38,761
like they are in the way.
They feel, like they are not important.

1491
01:41:39,031 --> 01:41:41,628
They don't have anything to their name.

1492
01:41:43,824 --> 01:41:44,958
I'm sorry.

1493
01:41:45,562 --> 01:41:47,562
Like they show up
with a trash bag

1494
01:41:47,792 --> 01:41:50,070
of shoes
and cloths that don't fit them.

1495
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:51,842
I saw where

1496
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:55,245
hair had been pulled out of uh,
their head.

1497
01:41:55,503 --> 01:41:58,081
We have had kids here
that had cigarette burns on them.

1498
01:41:58,804 --> 01:42:02,224
We have had kids that been abused
the worse way you ever can imagine.

1499
01:42:02,361 --> 01:42:06,065
And I'm very angry with the adults
that put them in that position.

1500
01:42:06,175 --> 01:42:10,098
A group of incredible people
spend a week with them,

1501
01:42:10,255 --> 01:42:12,038
providing
healing and hope,

1502
01:42:12,362 --> 01:42:14,362
as well as
great memories,

1503
01:42:14,603 --> 01:42:15,989
for a
young child.

1504
01:42:16,445 --> 01:42:18,109
Being in foster care
uh,

1505
01:42:18,306 --> 01:42:19,860
sometimes
builds up a lot of anger.

1506
01:42:19,943 --> 01:42:21,629
Um...,
I was a biter.

1507
01:42:22,012 --> 01:42:25,325
And, uh,
anytime another kid would

1508
01:42:25,349 --> 01:42:27,032
um...,
mess with me

1509
01:42:27,272 --> 01:42:28,985
or tick me off,
you know

1510
01:42:29,123 --> 01:42:30,598
I just go grab them
and bite them.

1511
01:42:30,781 --> 01:42:33,545
She was worried about uh,
someone coming in

1512
01:42:33,569 --> 01:42:35,592
and she's like
hey someone is coming in.

1513
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:38,752
In the cabin, someone is coming
into the cabin and I can't go to sleep.

1514
01:42:38,975 --> 01:42:41,744
It was a quilted blanket actually
from my grandmother I had with me.

1515
01:42:42,015 --> 01:42:44,698
And, I gave it to her and I was like
here take this blanket

1516
01:42:45,078 --> 01:42:47,038
you can sleep with it.
You know, a week long.

1517
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:50,289
And it has like
this special stitching on it

1518
01:42:50,313 --> 01:42:51,656
it's like super secret.

1519
01:42:52,013 --> 01:42:54,736
Like a super secret blanket
that keeps you invisible

1520
01:42:54,766 --> 01:42:57,223
and no one can touch you.
It protects you when you are asleep.

1521
01:42:57,247 --> 01:43:00,519
And she is like, okay.
And she like slept with the blanket

1522
01:43:00,569 --> 01:43:02,279
for like
the entire week.

1523
01:43:02,303 --> 01:43:03,922
And, uh,
she then even,

1524
01:43:03,946 --> 01:43:07,966
she went to sleep pretty easily
like for most of the nights.

1525
01:43:07,995 --> 01:43:10,771
I said, James, what you want?
What can I do, to help you?

1526
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:13,224
I was pretty
out of patience by then.

1527
01:43:13,612 --> 01:43:15,835
He just said,
I won't my dad to get out of jail.

1528
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:17,733
And started crying.
And um,

1529
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:19,978
And um, I have, you know
my father actually was an alcoholic.

1530
01:43:20,927 --> 01:43:22,927
We hugged
and we cried together.

1531
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:25,536
And we prayed
for our fathers together.

1532
01:43:25,727 --> 01:43:27,978
And as we walking up
to the dining comments

1533
01:43:28,011 --> 01:43:31,560
I was complaining to my wife
that I did not want to be on a camp

1534
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,813
for abused children
on my birthday.

1535
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:37,154
And from behind us
I heard this little guy speak up

1536
01:43:37,264 --> 01:43:39,264
and he said:
I never have had a birthday.

1537
01:43:40,428 --> 01:43:42,327
What you mean you never had
a birthday. I mean,

1538
01:43:42,351 --> 01:43:43,661
it was so,

1539
01:43:43,685 --> 01:43:46,712
it was so much a given,
you know, in my life.

1540
01:43:46,737 --> 01:43:48,495
So I ran into town,

1541
01:43:48,759 --> 01:43:52,344
uh, to, to the Kmart here
and I got him a watch.

1542
01:43:52,638 --> 01:43:57,255
And my wife said just, you know that,
it literally changed Royal Family forever.

1543
01:43:57,437 --> 01:44:00,167
She said I wonder
how many other kids here

1544
01:44:00,596 --> 01:44:02,596
don't experienced
a birthday party.

1545
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:05,769
And we found out,
none of the children,

1546
01:44:06,026 --> 01:44:08,466
none of the kids
we took to camp that year

1547
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:10,353
had ever had
a birtday party.

1548
01:44:10,524 --> 01:44:12,778
And this counselor says: okay,
George wants to go

1549
01:44:12,803 --> 01:44:14,949
do the swimt est.
And he is doing his dog peddling

1550
01:44:15,018 --> 01:44:19,436
kicking like crazy. Everyone in
the pool area is cheering him on.

1551
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,166
- There was so much screaming...
- Just screaming 'Go George, go George',

1552
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:27,066
 'Go George', it was like he just got
a gold medal it the Olympics.

1553
01:44:27,229 --> 01:44:29,366
Okay,
he gets his band,

1554
01:44:29,842 --> 01:44:32,522
and it's just,
it's like, his.

1555
01:44:32,966 --> 01:44:34,452
The best treasure
he could ever have.

1556
01:44:34,476 --> 01:44:36,159
He worked with this counselor
to be,

1557
01:44:36,356 --> 01:44:38,092
to be able to do that,
to archive that.

1558
01:44:38,369 --> 01:44:40,572
Lot of kids don't,
they come to our camp

1559
01:44:40,935 --> 01:44:42,935
they don't get
that positive reinforcement.

1560
01:44:42,978 --> 01:44:46,174
I have never seen the boys
eat more bacon

1561
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:48,974
at any other place in the word
than on a Royal Family kids camp,

1562
01:44:48,998 --> 01:44:50,267
it's disgusting.

1563
01:44:50,356 --> 01:44:51,366
They will,

1564
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:54,739
they will pile their plate up with bacon
and they will consume

1565
01:44:55,176 --> 01:44:56,992
the whole plate.

1566
01:44:57,102 --> 01:44:59,102
I said well that's dangerous,
yep, it probably is.

1567
01:44:59,656 --> 01:45:01,419
She couldn't read,
uh,

1568
01:45:01,869 --> 01:45:04,432
she hadn't been to school,
she wasn't in school.

1569
01:45:04,774 --> 01:45:07,164
So, I would sit there with her
each night and read her,

1570
01:45:07,188 --> 01:45:09,944
her letters and stuff,
and, uh,

1571
01:45:10,815 --> 01:45:13,751
you know, and I saw her face like,
as I was reading him to her

1572
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:15,604
she is like balance
for me.

1573
01:45:15,628 --> 01:45:18,464
And I was like,
yeah, balance for me

1574
01:45:18,488 --> 01:45:21,511
She said can someone else help me
because I want to write you something

1575
01:45:21,535 --> 01:45:25,498
and she actually took all the time
and effort to sit there and write out

1576
01:45:25,567 --> 01:45:28,973
you know, thank you for being
my camp counselor, I'm going miss you

1577
01:45:28,997 --> 01:45:30,997
see you, and I had
a great time at camp.

1578
01:45:31,621 --> 01:45:35,124
I cried the whole way home.
And, uh,

1579
01:45:41,505 --> 01:45:44,065
it's weird I haven't
remembered this

1580
01:45:44,288 --> 01:45:45,483
since last year.

1581
01:45:48,506 --> 01:45:50,100
So, um...,

1582
01:45:51,016 --> 01:45:52,154
I got home,

1583
01:45:52,778 --> 01:45:55,087
and I told Jessica,
um...,

1584
01:45:56,497 --> 01:45:59,521
we have to,
we have to find this boy Michael.

1585
01:45:59,805 --> 01:46:02,848
We, we sat out a mentorship program
that we were able too.

1586
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:06,274
We talked to him every week
and see him.

1587
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:09,181
Trough that process we found out
he needed a home,

1588
01:46:09,205 --> 01:46:11,505
and was needing
to be adopted.

1589
01:46:11,537 --> 01:46:14,937
And it didn't take long
until we decided that

1590
01:46:14,962 --> 01:46:17,659
we needed to be that home
and adopted him.

1591
01:46:18,367 --> 01:46:20,723
Creating a safe place
for these kids for a week

1592
01:46:20,747 --> 01:46:24,621
it just be, who they are in love
them exactly where they are at

1593
01:46:24,646 --> 01:46:26,923
is probably the most powerful thing
we can do for them.

1594
01:46:26,948 --> 01:46:28,947
You feel like, you're poking
the devil in the eye.

1595
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,000
Yeah,
that's what it's like.

1596
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:33,914
Know what you are doing,
you punch them right in the nose.

1597
01:46:34,004 --> 01:46:36,090
That's what it's like,
you stand right up there

1598
01:46:36,115 --> 01:46:38,334
and you grab them by the throat
and punch them right on the nose.

1599
01:46:38,562 --> 01:46:39,915
That's what we do
every week.

1600
01:46:40,058 --> 01:46:42,404
Come to camp.
It's one week

1601
01:46:42,915 --> 01:46:43,761
and,

1602
01:46:44,051 --> 01:46:46,515
it can really make a difference
in the life of a child.

1603
01:46:46,539 --> 01:46:48,539
We asked ourselves:

1604
01:46:49,075 --> 01:46:51,902
have we done anything
that's been this hard ever in our life?

1605
01:46:52,578 --> 01:46:53,485
No.

1606
01:46:54,662 --> 01:46:57,465
So we sat around.
We cried out every tear we had.

1607
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:58,613
We, uh,

1608
01:46:59,024 --> 01:47:01,773
we loved the children
to the best of our ability

1609
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:03,797
as we went around the world
we all said

1610
01:47:04,306 --> 01:47:06,306
[Sighs]
I don't think I can do it again.

1611
01:47:07,402 --> 01:47:08,988
And then someone said it:

1612
01:47:10,011 --> 01:47:11,449
'How can we not?'

1613
01:47:13,525 --> 01:47:15,525
Yeah.
How can we not do it again.

1614
01:47:17,613 --> 01:47:19,613
[Music orchestral]

1615
01:49:09,557 --> 01:49:10,814
The End
