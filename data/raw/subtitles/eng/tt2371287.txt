Uh, hey, Samuel.

173
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,679
- These kids.
- Yeah?

174
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,914
They're not normal. Right?

175
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:45,953
You didn't read the manual?

176
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,429
- Uh, no I... - Good. It's a bunch
of namby pamby stuff if you ask me.

177
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:50,759
Look,
here's what you need to know.

You're not the foster parent or
the caregiver. You're not the teacher.

179

You're just here to help the
kid have fun for one week.

Hey, Kaitlynn, what's up?

184
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,039
We got a nibble from Summerfield.

185
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,276
- Alright, let's seal the deal.

186
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,036
- And let's not forget
who's amazing idea this was.

187
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,191
Make it happen, alright?

188
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:18,917
- I want a raise.
[Phone beeps]

189
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:24,796
Don't let Tammie see that.
Come on, I'm gonna show you camp.

190
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:33,634
- Little R and R before the craziness begins?
- Yeah, I'm definitely a fan of that.

Pete here's an airline pilot most of the year
but this week he's in charge of the pool.

Right on man.
Swimming already huh?

193
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,842
Yeah, I like to open the pool for
the counselors before the kids get here.

194
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:46,283
- Great idea. I used to be a guard
myself in high school. - Really?

195
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,364
Yeah, yeah. Alright,
I'm gonna go get my trunks I think.

196
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,054
So what I'm thinking is...

197
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,491
- Hey, no cell phones.
- I'll just take it and put it over here.

198

wanna play? Let's play. - Well.

Glad to see you're back.

These kids have had rough lives

211
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,237

to share our hope, with them.

There are no cell phones
around the kids, Lacee.

214

Yeah. See,
all these new smartphones,

215
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,798
they're just a temptation
for the kids to steal them.

350
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:03,866
Remind me to tell you a story
about this guy

351
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,382
who was taken from his family.

352
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,570
He was in and out of prison

353
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,975
but God had a
special plan for his life.

354
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:14,986
And he ended up working for
the King of Egypt. [Woah]

355
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,256
I was taken from my sister.

356
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,486
- My dad's in prison.

357
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,621
Is this the Joseph in the bible?

358
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,929
I think we have some
announcements right now.

359
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:27,837

And please do come to my tea party.

366
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,349
Tea parties are for girls.

367
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:50,116
Well, then I guess the girls are going
to get all the cookies.

368
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:54,617
- Samuel, how are we going to get cookies?
- We'll work something out.

369
00:23:54,749 --> 00:24:00,199
Oh, and a reminder, the variety show.
I want to see all your talents on the stage.

370
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:04,063
- Stupid kids. They don't have talent.
- Hey, be nice.

371
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,728
I think, um,
I think that's it, right?

372
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,499
- The pool!
- Swimming!

373
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,224

- The pool, that sounds like fun.
- Lame.

376
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,075
You're joking, right?

Oh! Okay.

- No!

391
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:03,019
I just don't want to swim.

392
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:05,819
What's your problem?
You don't know how to swim?

393
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,767
- I can swim. - What are you?
Afraid of the water? Little chicken.

394
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:10,700
Shut up!

395
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,533
Bock! Bock! Bock!

Shut up!

397
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:16,402
I know why you really don't
want to go swimming.

398
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,237
That's enough, Amigo.
Come on, let's hit the pool.

399
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:22,242
- Sissy!
- Turd!

400
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:29,585
Look kid, it's alright that you're afraid
of the water. I was just teasing you.

401
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:32,351
I told you I'm not afraid of water.
Stop saying I'm.

402
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,087
What's your problem?

403
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,242
You.

404
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,086
[Laughs]
Funny.

405

00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,134
Woah, woah.

407
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,354
Look,

00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:46,970
all the other kids, are down
at the pool having a good time.

409
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,325
Don't want to miss out
on that do you?

410
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:49,584
Go to hell.

411
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,109
Get your swim suit on now

You serious kid?

413
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:01,952
Alright guys listen up.
There's only one way to get this arm band.

414
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:07,258
You have to swim all the way across the
deep end without any help whatsoever.

415
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,725
So, who's going to be the few,
the brave?

416
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,765
Who's going to join the ranks of
Pete's Ultimate Camp Swim Club?

417
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,008
You can do this.

418
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,188
I'm not sure.

419
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,636
I will be cheering for you
the whole way.

420
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:21,902
- But what if I don't make it?
- You totally will.

421
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,056
You are so strong
and I will be waiting for you

422
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:25,667

You're not going to let me drown,
are you?

426
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,818
Not in my pool.

427
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:43,796

- I almost made it.

445
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,709
Just keep working on it with Samuel.
You'll get it.

446
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:12,908
- Where's Eli?
- I told him to stay at the cabin.

447
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,884
- What?
- You left him alone?

448
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,747
The kid spit on me,
okay?

449
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,453

Okay, the three of us
need to have a talk. - Fantastic.

453
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:46,218
Someone here needs to apologize.

454
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,903
It's me.

455
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:54,591
I really wanted you to come to camp, Eli,
but we were short a counselor.

456
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:59,358
So, Ken, even though he doesn't know
how to be a good counselor,

457
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,784
he came up to fill in.

458
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,264
It's okay,
I always get screwed.

459
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,162
Okay.
So how about this?

460
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,981
No spitting,
stick together,

I hear there's
a kickball game happening.

464
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:23,436
Why don't you two go down
and play before dinner?

465
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,521
Don't leave him alone again.

466

[Cheering] Alright Redford, let's
get on base buddy! Let's go!

00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:55,935
- Hey Samuel, here to relieve you.
- Jimbo.

513
00:32:56,524 --> 00:33:00,472
Well, as soon as you guys get settled in
your bunks, we can start the story time.

514
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:03,404
Sweet!
Do you have any UFO stories?

515
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:06,172
Hey, kid, what's that whole
mess you're making up there?

516
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,250
Alien defense.
I don't want them

517
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,983
sneaking up
and sucking out my intestines.

518
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:12,243
I see.

519
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,582
- Ready for a story now.

520
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,590
- Here it is!
It's in Eli's bag, he took it!

521
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:21,891
Whatever,
you probably just put it there.

522
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:25,463
- Why did you take it?
- He's always taking stuff at Locustwood.

523
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:27,226
[Screams]

524

[Door opens - Groans]

525
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:33,229
Not again, man,
I'm getting tired.

526
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:35,269
- Let's go soldier,
double time!

527
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:40,311
[Door closes]
- Is it safe to come out yet?

528
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,778
- [Reading] There we are, said
Mrs. Puddleduck, good as new.

529
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:51,421
[Reading] She opened the shutters and let
the warm sunlight spill into the cozy room.

530
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:55,288
[Reading] Charlotte could smell the
roses growing in the garden just below.

531
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:58,892
[Reading] Mrs. Puddleduck looked
lovingly at Charlotte and said,

532
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,168
just come to me every day and let me
remind you how much I care.

533
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,435
- Alright, story time is over.
Time for bed.

534
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,712
- No, no!
I don't want to go to bed.

535
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,674
Can we read another story,
please?

536
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,363
No, we're going to have
a long day tomorrow.

537
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,891
You've got to get some sleep.
Come on, into bed!

538
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,475
I'm not tired, can we go
for a walk, Bridgett?

539
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,350
- Uh.
- Please?

540
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,696
You, almost fell asleep
on the ﬂoor, Bellie Boo,

541
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,876
and I can barely
keep my eyes open myself. Come on.

542
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:33,523
No, no! I don't want to go to bed.
Let's stay up, please, please!

543
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,910
- It's okay. It's okay Bella.
Bella, it's okay.

544
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,940
Bella, you're safe here. You're okay.
Nothing is going to hurt you.

545
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,771
He'll come here too.
He will.

546
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:54,278
Uh, Bridgett, can you move
your bed next to hers?

547
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,065
Um, yeah.

548
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:04,626
How about that? Look, she's going to put
her bed right next to yours.

549
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,494
Look how close.
Better?

550
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,129
[Snifﬂes]

551
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,966
My magic blanket!

552
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,336
Magic blanket?

553
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,033
Almost forgot that I brought it.
Okay.

554
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,075
My great grandmother made it.

555
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:23,838
It's pretty.

556
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,785
Come here.

557
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,909
My grandma made this,
not only with stitches and cloth,

558
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,576
but with all of her love.
Here.

559
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,419
Read what it says.

560
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:42,095
- Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

561
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:48,096
Guard me Jesus through the night
and wake me with the morning light.

562
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:55,774
You know, I don't really use it that
much anymore. You want to borrow it?

563
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,777
- Really?
- Mmm hmm.

564
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,190
It is magic.

565
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,201
- Just leave me alone.
[Door closes]

566
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:24,366
[Footsteps]
I give up.

567
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,604
Ken, go!

568
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,053
These are the only shoes they sent Gabby
up with and they're two sizes too small.

569
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:37,147
I let her borrow my ﬂip ﬂops.

570
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:40,852
I'll have Pete go in to town
first thing. Size?

571
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:42,158
Five.

572
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,497
[Door opens]

573
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:45,656
- So it begins.
- Yeah.

574
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,757
- Sam. - Randy took
Bryce's stuff over to Cabin five.

575
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,296
What'd the nurse say
about the bite?

576
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,200
Thankfully,
it didn't break the skin.

577
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,774
What about those two?
What are you thinking?

578
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,409
I hate to admit I was wrong.
I should have known.

579
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:03,913
Eli's social workers wanted us to
send him back if he got violent.

580
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:05,781
I'm going to have to
send them both back.

581
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:07,079
Give them one more day.

582
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:12,784
I can't risk the entire camp for them.
Look Sam, a lot can happen in a day.

583
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:16,121
[Door opens]
Then he runs again, yeah.

584
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,824
Yeah, I think she gave me the
worst kid here on purpose.

585
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,657
Hey, I got to go but as soon as you
get that meeting you let me know.

586
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,104
Okay? Alright, bye.

587
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,478
[Phone beeps]

588
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,446
So, how was your first day?

589
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,803
Thanks for the troubled kid.
What's wrong with him?

590
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,171
Nothing.

591
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:40,286
[Scoffs]
Nothing?

592
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,184
[Door opens - Door closes]

593
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:51,227
- Is there anything here but junk food?
- There's some apples in the fridge.

594
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:52,798
- Excellent.

595
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:06,270
So, what's up with your freak kid?
Uh, Robert.

596
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:09,759
Redford.

597
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah, seriously?
What's that kid, like 10 years old?

598
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:15,054
He's already in some need
of serious therapy.

599
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,629
You know, I wonder if these kids here
wouldn't benefit more

600
00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:21,082
from a bunch of psychos
rather than us. Right?

601
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:22,958
The first day can be pretty hard.

602
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,416
Yeah, no kidding!
My kid had me run probably

603
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,256
20 miles
around this place today.

604
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:30,895
It's going to take a month's worth
of chiropractic work to fix my neck.

605
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:35,569
Hey Randy, how long did you say
you've been doing this again?

606
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,936
Three years.

607
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,039
Glutton for punishment, huh?

608
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,744
You know, I thought
you had the worst kid, but

609
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:45,308
obviously Tammie
has it out for me.

610
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,681
- You know what I thin...
- Time to go!

611
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,792
Hey man, take it easy!

612
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:59,082
- Don't "easy" me! Now you listen
and you listen good, maggot.

613
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,836
You may be good at making money
in your pretty little office

614
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,945
but, I have been
to hell and back.

615
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:07,905
I've killed in service and I've watched
my buddies bleed to death from IED's.

616
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,106
Camp, is a walk in the park compared
to war you non contributing zero.

617
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,584
When I think back to my army
days it gets me all worked up.

618
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,037
Believe me, when you're under fire
in a war zone

619
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,572
you think of the oddest things.

620
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:31,846
Wayne,

621
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,908
was the only person who
told me he loved me,

622
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:37,232
ever.

623
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:39,830
Wayne?

624
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,501
My counselor,

625
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,863
from this camp.

626
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:54,144
I was a mean,
violent, nasty kid.

627
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,883
Hated everyone,
especially Wayne.

628
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,180
Must have bit him
like 20 times.

629
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:03,337
And when I
left camp,

630
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,770
he told me he loved me.

631
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,462
And I spit on him
when I got on the bus.

632
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,824
Tried to find him
when I got out of the service.

633
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,775
He had died the year before.

634
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,956
Never got a chance to tell him

635
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,006
thanks for changing my life.

636
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,187
So, I don't care
if you don't like the food,

637
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:35,866
or me,

638
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:37,336
or camp.

639
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,932
You will figure out a way to be
a good counselor to that kid.

640
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,954
You get me?

641
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:48,340
Figure it out.

642

<i>[Dreaming] How many times do I have
to tell you to stay in your room?</i>

643

<i>- Eli? What are you doing?
Where are you?</i>

653
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:05,110
I'm at camp at Pine Lake.

00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:08,111
<i>- Camp?
What are you doing at camp?</i>

655
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,448
I don't know.

656
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,808
They made me come here.

657
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,675
My counselor's awful
and the food is worse than Locustwood.

658
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,920
<i>- Alright, don't worry.
I'm coming to get you.</i>

659
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,351
No dad. Never mind,
I'm okay, I'm fi...

No dad, no.
[Line goes dead]

662
00:42:56,624 --> 00:43:00,902
- What time is it?
- Time to get up, princess.

663
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,442
Eek! Call that beauty sleep?
You might want to try something else.

664
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:07,135
Eli, rise and shine soldier!

665
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:08,279
Where's my phone?

666
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,542
You're not supposed
to have a phone.

667
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,515
Funny kid.
Have you seen it?

668
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:14,662
No.

669
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:17,652
- Are you sure
you haven't seen it?

670
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,756
Oh, here it is.
I thought I plugged it in.

671
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:26,690
Check your messages later.
We've got to get moving.

672
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:31,236

to make it to muddy creek before breakfast.

Muddy creek!

That's right soldier. The early
bird gets the, Crawdad!

675
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:48,052
Does he really have to strip
right here in front of everyone?

676
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,950
- Where else
is he going to change?

677
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:51,781
I'm not changing
till everyone leaves.

678
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:55,486
That might be a problem see, cause we
can't leave until you change clothes.

679
00:43:55,949 --> 00:44:00,091
- Seriously kid, we're all boys. It doesn't
matter if we see each other in our underwear.

680
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:01,633
Eli, come on.

681
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:05,898
Hold on a second, Sam.

682
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:21,216
What do you think?

683
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,488
Fine, whatever.

684
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:29,016
Alright then. Hurry up.
Come on, find your pants.

685
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:34,526
All the good fishing spots
are right out here.

686
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:41,439
There's gonna be some really great
crawdads right over there, okay?

687
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:47,205
If you're waiting for it to dry
it's going to be a long wait.

688
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:02,891
You find any leeches,
soldier, you let me know.

689
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,120
Leeches?
Seriously?

690
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,558
They'll be attached to your toes.

691
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,900
Leeches, great.

692
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:28,953
[Woah] Oh, looks like you got one soldier!
That's what I'm talking about.

693
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:35,152
See this crawdad, they look like these
creatures I've seen on my home planet.

694
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:37,660
This is your home planet,
stupid.

695
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,254
No it isn't.
I'm from Zenith.

696
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,993
Don't call me a liar.

697
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:46,595
Mm, mm, mm. You've insulted
Zenithians for the last time!

698
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:48,432
[Struggles]
- Hey, come on guys.

699
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,031
- Woah, woah, woah!
[Splash]

700
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:51,097
[Laughs]

701
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,644
[Screams]

702
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,104
Good one, Ken!

703
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:57,577
I like the new look!

704
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:58,988
Oh, you haven't heard?

705
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:03,552
Mud does good things for your complexion.
Come on down, I'll show you.

706
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:07,457
No, no. Thanks, I'm good.
Are the crawdads biting?

707
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,001
Oh yeah, they're definitely
some kind of alien creatures.

708
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:13,912
They like raw meat.
[Nom, nom, nom]

709
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:15,684
[Chatter]

710
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:20,068
- Oh bacon!
- I've never seen so much bacon!

711
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:26,357
- So, Bella and I are going to go
to aunt Tammie's tea party.

712
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:29,224
What do you think kid?
Want to join them?

713
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,293
What?

714
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:35,275
- The tea party's for girls.
- Right.

715
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:37,819
Eli, want to go swimming today?

716
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:39,715
I already told you, no swimming.

717
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,353
Hey, the water's not
going to hurt you.

718
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:43,192
Besides, you know,
it's hot out. Take a dip in th...

719
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,594
No swimming, okay?

720
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:45,957
- Okay.

721
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,463
Okay, mister party pooper.

722
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:50,699
We'll just stay in the cabin
all day and do nothing.

723
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:52,179
Sound fun?

724
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,583
[Phone beeps]

725
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,945
- Tum it off, put it away,
keep it away.

726
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:07,448
Look, I've got an important
prospective client.

727
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,955
It could be worth a lot,
so...

728
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:11,459
Okay. Well,
remember Eli, your camper?

729
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:12,888
He's important too.

730
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,469
I know.

731
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:18,747
I'm aware I suck at this, okay,
but I'm trying to do better today.

732
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:21,025
We did the whole
get in the mud thing.

733
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,274
You're mean to him.

734
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,327
He's mean to me.

735
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,956
- He's ten!
- So!

736
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,044
Put the phone away
and maybe

737
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,984
you'll be able
to keep track of your camper.

738
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:47,024
[Chatter]

739
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,524
Remember? We've got to
stick together, alright?

740
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:10,236
[Cheers - Splashes]

741
00:48:10,237 --> 00:48:13,343
Sure sounds like the kids are having
fun over there at the pool, huh?

742
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,634
You know,
I used to be a lifeguard.

743
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,919
It would be like you had
your own personal,

744
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:21,118
lifeguard.

745
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:24,214
I told you,
I'm not afraid of water.

746
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,193
Well you know what, that's sure
what it sounds like to me, kid.

747
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:28,563
I'm not a liar!
I hate you!

748
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:53,387
Here, let me help you.

749
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,681
No, no, no, not like that.
Can't you ju...

750
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,317
- I've just never done it before.
- It's not that hard.

751
00:48:58,318 --> 00:48:59,619
Can't you just take
the arrow and pu...

752
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,794
- I've never done it before.
- Neither have these kids either, okay?

753
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:04,401
You know what,
just forget it!

754
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,166
[Chatter]

755
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,063
Wow!
I want to ride the bikes!

756
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:17,181
We can ride the bikes.
Let's go check it out.

757
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:18,567
No we can't.

758
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,887
Sure we can.
There's plenty left.

759
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,529
Look, there's a purple one right there, you
want that one? It looks about your size.

760
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:27,125
I don't know how.

761
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,597
What do you mean?

762
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:31,663
They said
I'm too fat to ride one.

763
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,859
Gabby,
do you know what today is?

764
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:39,197
What?

765
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,208
Today's the day you're gonna
learn how to ride a bike!

766
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,336
Really?

767
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,431
Uh huh!
Let's go!

768
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:46,069
Can we grab that one please?

769
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,701
Alright, come on.

770
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,637
Got it?

771
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:54,346
Alright, you got this.

772
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:56,515
[Crash]
Gabby. You okay?

773
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:59,311
[Giggles]

774
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:00,368
- Gabby!

775
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,925
- I'm okay!
- Oh, good.

776
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:05,622
- Can I try again?
- Of course you can, come on!

777
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:28,139
Look,

778
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:31,484
kid. I didn't mean t...
- Whatever, okay?

779
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:37,691
Okay, okay. You don't want to swim,
you don't like archery,

780
00:50:37,757 --> 00:50:41,322
you don't want to go to the tea party.
What would you like to do instead?

781
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,526
Shoot, anything.
I'm up for it, tell me.

782
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,268
I want to go
to the other side of the lake.

783
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,262
- I don't think
they allow that, kid.

784
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:53,213
Why don't we do something
back here at camp, okay?

785
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,473
Figures.
You said it but you don't mean it.

786
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:56,936
That's not fair and you know I...

787
00:50:56,994 --> 00:50:58,241
You said it!

788
00:50:58,528 --> 00:51:00,407
You just lie
like everyone else.

789
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,719
We should go back to the cabin now.

790
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,625
- Look what I got!
Made from alien skin.

791
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:10,614
Pretty sure he swallowed
half the pool, but he made it!

792
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,919
Hey, let me see that.

793
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:13,656
- No, it's mine!
- Hey.

794
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:15,767
That's not a nice way to
treat a fellow soldier.

795
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:18,963
Can we just go back to the cabin now?
I hate it here.

796
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:23,901
Back to the cabin.

797
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:28,874
Figures, I get the kid that wants
to do something we can't even do.

798
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:30,366
He wants to hike a mile away.

799
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,147
Where?

800
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:37,555
Come on. Looks like we're
going for a hike now.

801
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:39,955
Ugh!

802
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,573
Why don't you try to talk to him?

803
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:02,107
Yeah, I don't really feel like going for
a hundred yard dash again,

804
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,182
but thanks.

805
00:52:04,864 --> 00:52:08,334
- Why do you think he runs?
- Because he likes being a pain?

806
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,136
Try again, soldier.

807
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:14,784
Man, all I know is
he's testing my patience.

808
00:52:15,295 --> 00:52:16,978
He is testing you

809
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:19,527
to see if you give
a damn,

810
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:22,031
because no one else does.

811
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,688
How's it going?

812
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:48,090
I just want to get away
from that stupid camp.

813
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:49,655
Yeah, no kidding.

814
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,101
Think you're right about the tea party,
that would be pretty lame.

815
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:57,057
Sounds lame. What do they
even do there anyway?

816
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,041
I don't know.
We'd have to go to find out.

817
00:53:00,462 --> 00:53:02,262
They do have treats though.

818
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:05,399
Yeah, but you've got to dress up.
Girl stuff.

819
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,917
It sucks
not having an arm band.

820
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:13,951
Yup,
gotta get into that pool.

821
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:19,115
You know, you could really get me
one if you wanted to. You suck.

822
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:22,625
[Whispers]
Hopeless.

823
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,929
You know what, kid?
[Thunder cracks]

824
00:53:25,713 --> 00:53:27,042
Come on.
Up.

825
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,863
- Finally! The mothership
has come back for me!

826
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:35,220
Take me home!
Take me home!

827
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:38,187
Take me home!
[Thunder cracks]

828
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:48,673
These mountain storms
pass quickly.

829
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,696
It'll be sunny again tomorrow.

830
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:54,130
That's the closest
the mothership has come yet.

831
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,239
Sucks, huh soldier?

832
00:53:58,956 --> 00:54:01,699
They'll come back for me,
someday.

833
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:05,099
Why don't we check our mail?

834
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,164
Hey,
did I get a letter from my dad?

835
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,705
Got something here
from Tammie for you.

836
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:19,149
No thanks.

837
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,289
Alright, here you go Bella.

838
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:27,323
Here you go Maribel.

839
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,322
You can open those, Maribel.

840
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,892
I'm saving them.

841
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,067
You'll get more tomorrow,
go ahead and read them.

842
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:37,768
I don't like reading.

843
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,743
Don't like reading?
Uh.

844
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:43,868
Everyone likes
reading their letters.

845
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:47,634
[Whispers]
Lacee.

846
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:50,773
Maybe she's not that good at it.

847
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,062
What?

848
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:53,673
[Mouths]
Reading.

849
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:55,971
Oh.

850
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:03,423
Maribel, can we talk?

851
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,961
What grade are you in
at school, sweetie?

852
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,371
My mom, my mom didn't
like taking me to school.

853
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,811
I have an idea, can I
read your letters to you?

854
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:33,772
"Dear Maribel, You rocked it
on the kickball field today soldier.

855
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:36,790
You can be on my team anytime.
Sergeant Sam."

856
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:39,721
Read this one.
- Okay.

857
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,964
"Dear Maribel, You are so much fun
to hang out with here at camp.

858
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:48,393
Tomorrow,
we get to do the tea party."

859
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:49,453
[Laughs]

860
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:52,537
"You are going to be so beautiful
in one of the dresses.

861
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:54,736
I can't wait to see
which one you pick.

862
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,982
I'm so lucky to have you
as a camper this week."

863
00:55:58,204 --> 00:55:59,859
You wrote that one!

864
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:02,737
- Yeah, I did. Do you want
to read more? -Yeah.

865
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:13,996
Red, turn that thing off
and go to sleep soldier.

866
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:18,226
- I can't find my alien band.
- You're not supposed to take it off.

867
00:56:18,558 --> 00:56:20,265
It was itchy.

868
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,407
Here it is!

869
00:56:26,406 --> 00:56:27,832
- No, uh, wait!

870
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,478
That one's not yours.
I found it.

871
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:34,082
What do you mean you found it?

872
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,024
- Wait a minute.

873
00:56:36,442 --> 00:56:40,488
You took my alien band
because it's made of alien skin

874
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,142
and you want to be
an alien, like me. Admit it.

875
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:48,596
Look, there's no such
things as aliens you freak.

876
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:49,114
Guys!

877
00:56:49,154 --> 00:56:52,301
No mothership, no Zenith,
and we eat spaghetti for lunch,

878
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:56,963
not alien guts.
No one is ever coming for you.

879
00:56:57,298 --> 00:57:00,008
Never, ever, ever.

880
00:57:02,095 --> 00:57:03,204
Ow!

881
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:05,476
Hey, what are you doing?
Huh?

882
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,646
- Hold this, sweetie.

883
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,118
How do you feel?

884
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:19,160
I've had worse.

885
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,730
Well, you certainly took it like a champ.

886
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:31,400
Samuel, is it true?

887
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,571
What's that?

888
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:36,341
The aliens aren't coming for me.

889
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,845
Hey, you don't give up hope, you hear me?
Don't give up hope.

890
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:54,864
You and these stupid arm bands. Why
can't you stop taking what's not yours?

891
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:56,069
I didn't.

892
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:02,841
Oh really? Well somehow it magically
ended up on your bed then. I wonder how.

893
00:58:04,831 --> 00:58:07,778
Nothing to say huh?
Yeah, figures.

894
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,574
You know, with all your running away
and stealing things,

895
00:58:13,068 --> 00:58:16,794
you're making me look like
a bad counselor.

896
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,487
That's because
you are a bad counselor.

897
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:24,927
No, you know what?
You are bad, you.

898
00:58:28,116 --> 00:58:29,304
[Door slams]

899
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:31,981
[Sighs]

900
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,990
- Let me exp...
- Just wait here.

901
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,947
So when do I go back?

902
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,590
We can't have kids
beating other kids up.

903
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:53,029
You understand?

904
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:02,792
Ken hasn't been
the best counselor, huh?

905
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:05,164
Ken's the worst counselor ever.

906
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:09,869
Okay.

907
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,043
Tell you what,

908
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:14,366
I'll give you a second chance

909
00:59:14,975 --> 00:59:17,346
if you think you can give Ken
a second chance.

910
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,642
Okay.

911
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,563
Good. Come on,
get in bed. Up.

912
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,296
Up, up, up.

913
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,588
Ms. Tammie.

914
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:33,707
Yup?

915
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:38,062
Will you tell Redford
I'm sorry.

916
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,837
I will.
Goodnight Eli.

917
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:50,498
[Phone beeps]

918
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:53,377
- Well, when's he going back?
- What?

919
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:56,952
- When is he going home?
- Shh! Ken.

920
00:59:59,412 --> 01:00:00,516
Is that what you want?

921
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:02,772
Tammie, If we're not careful
I may end up gett...

922
01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:05,289
we may end up getting sued
by Redford's parents.

923
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:10,295
What parents Ken? His dead mom
or his drug dealer dad?

924
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:13,462
You know, look. You can't just throw out
right and wrong okay?

925
01:00:13,535 --> 01:00:16,904
The kid has broken every single rule
and there need to be consequences.

926
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:20,136
In Eli's world, right and wrong,
they tend to get a little bit muddled.

927
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:24,543
And if the adults in his life can't tell
the difference, how can we expect him to?

928
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:28,182
Alright so forgive me if I have a
little bit of compassion here.

929
01:00:28,306 --> 01:00:29,663
But please, don't you worry.

930
01:00:29,728 --> 01:00:33,781
Nobody's going to complain
that Eli's counselor doesn't give a care.

931
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:38,618
I'm trying to care,
Tammie.

932
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:42,696
But that kid
is totally screwed up.

933
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:48,707
I can't do this.

934
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:51,667
I mean,

935
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:53,872
how do you like
a kid like that?

936
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:02,202
You just have to find
one thing to like.

937
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:04,042
Just one thing.

938
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:06,468
And pray for him.
- [Scoffs]

939
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:08,892
All these kids
could use our prayers.

940
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:11,268
Alright, okay.

941
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:14,745
Well, for example,
there's one thing I like about you.

942
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:17,789
Really?

943
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,368
- Porsche Carrera 4.
- [Laughs]

944
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:32,107
330 horsepower, 0-60 in 5.2 seconds.
Be still my beating heart.

945
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:36,184
Nice. Girls don't like boys,
they like cars and money.

946
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,221
Okay,
goodnight Ken.

947
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:39,652
Goodnight.

948
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,457
And Joseph told his brothers,
who had sold him to be a slave,

949
01:01:44,857 --> 01:01:46,491
that what they meant
for evil,

950
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:50,094
God used for good
for his entire family.

951
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:52,075
Amen.

952
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:53,235
[Amens]

953
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,829
Well, my friend Pete has an announcement
to make, so Pete, would you come on up.

954
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:59,035
[Applause]

955
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,473
Great news!
Yesterday at the pool,

956
01:02:02,563 --> 01:02:05,418
four more campers joined
the hundred year tradition

957
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:08,348
of Pete's
Ultimate Camp Swim Club!!

958
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:09,887
[Applause and cheers]

959
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:14,083
So, if the club is 100 years old,
how old does that make you?

960
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:15,590
[Laughter]

961
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,325
Please stand
and raise your bands high!

962
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,385
[Applause and cheers]

963
01:02:21,888 --> 01:02:24,767
- Way to go guys!
- Really good!

964
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:34,169
- Can you get me one of those arm bands?
- You know I can't.

965
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:37,737
Buy one, steal one. You could do
it if you were a good counselor.

966
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:41,473
[Sighs]

967
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:45,715
- Come on, I want to show you something.
- [Singing] - We can't just leave.

968
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:47,767
[Whispers]
Who's going to stop us?

969
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,008
♪ ... we like fun ♪

970
01:02:50,817 --> 01:02:58,360
♪ It's great just knowing I'm a part of
God's family, playin' under the sun ♪

971
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:03,553
- This is your car?! No way!!
- Yes way.

972
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:08,907
- You wanna get in - Yes!
- Come on, hop in, dude.

973
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:17,930
Whoa!

974
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,887
How did you get this?

975
01:03:22,014 --> 01:03:26,485
Well, I didn't steal it, or trick someone.
I worked really hard for it.

976
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:29,327
If you want something bad enough,
you'll do almost anything for it.

977
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,064
- You really want that wrist band, right?
- Yea.

978
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:42,444
Look, I may be a lousy counselor,
but I'm a great swimmer.

979
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:46,138
And I can teach you to swim across
that pool faster than anybody.

980
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,618
- But, I don't want to swim
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

981
01:03:49,028 --> 01:03:51,455
and you aren't afraid of water,
blah, blah blah.

982
01:03:51,598 --> 01:03:53,790
We only have a few days left
here at camp

983
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,526
and it's going to take time for me
to teach you how to swim.

984
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:57,922
So what are we going to do?

985
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:02,630
Eli.

986
01:04:08,301 --> 01:04:09,768
Let's be honest.

987
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:12,881
We don't really like each other
or get along too well, do we?

988
01:04:14,734 --> 01:04:17,400
But there is one thing
I like about you, dude.

989
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:20,913
You're a fighter.
A real fighter.

990
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:26,509
And if you really want that wristband,
you're going to have to fight for it.

991
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,424
Whatever is keeping you out of
the water... you've got to fight it.

992
01:04:35,087 --> 01:04:37,033
[Laughter and splashing]

993
01:04:56,475 --> 01:05:00,582
Hey. Give me your towel.
Just go for it.

994
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:24,295
Hey.

995
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:31,240
On three we jump in
together, okay, Eli?

996
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:33,789
Okay.

997
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,588
One. Two. Three.

999
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,063
Come here. Come here.

01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:57,272
Whoa!

1001
01:05:59,772 --> 01:06:02,116
[Splashing, laughing and yelling]

1002
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:20,678
[Sighs]

1003
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:30,303
Fancy.
[Laughter]

1004
01:06:34,874 --> 01:06:38,845
- The tea party's this afternoon.
- That's what I hear.

1005
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,259
[Sigh]
Did you know?

1006
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:51,037
You know... um...
about Eli?

1007
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,233
I try not to think about
their past too much.

1008
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:00,876
I focus on a hopeful future.

1009

[Door shutting]

1010
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,339
Hey you!
You were awesome in the pool today!

1011
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:13,818
I think you won,
like, every chicken fight?

1012
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,686
Hey, why are you
wearing that dress?

1013
01:07:15,816 --> 01:07:17,816
[British accent]
Oh, I'm going to a tea party.

1014
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:20,254
I know, I know,
it's just for girls.

1015
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:23,415
- Okay, well we are off.

1016
01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:27,898
Enjoy your tea party.
- I shall.

1017
01:07:36,268 --> 01:07:38,038
Hey, do me a favour.

1018

01:17:48,847 --> 01:17:50,622
Not bad, man.
Not bad.

1188
01:17:54,019 --> 01:17:55,657
You know my mom is dead?

1189
01:17:57,356 --> 01:17:58,562
Like your dad?

1190
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:03,872
No, I didn't know that.

1191
01:18:06,998 --> 01:18:08,636
She was the meanest person.

1192
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:12,011
She never let me go out
of my room.

1193
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,999
She wanted to be
with her boyfriends.

1194
01:18:14,059 --> 01:18:16,242
She made me hide
when they came over.

1195
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,650
She didn't like it when I talked
to other kids. She hated me.

1196
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:22,118
Well, I hate you mom,
I hate you!

1197
01:18:22,214 --> 01:18:24,337
[Sobbing]
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

1198
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:27,519
Hey it's okay.

1199
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:31,230
He's uh,
he's just a little upset.

1200
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,596
- Hey Eli.

1201
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:37,597
The other kids are making s'mores.
Wanna come get some?

1202
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,439
What are s'mores?

1203
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:44,600
[British accent] - Oh they're just
the most delicious dessert.

1204
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:47,182
All marshmallows
and chocolate all melted together.

1205
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:49,249
They're really quite exquisite.

1206
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:52,085
- Sure.
- Come on.

1207
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,458
Yeah, yeah,
go on, go on.

1208
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,099
I wanna go
for the armband tomorrow.

1209
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:04,988
Yeah.

1210
01:19:06,148 --> 01:19:07,448
You're gonna get it.

1211
01:19:07,603 --> 01:19:08,695
No problem.

1212
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:15,253
I..., I have to help out
with the s'mores, but um,

1213
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:17,545
this is for Porsche.

1214
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:41,371
[NO dialogues]

1215
01:19:53,138 --> 01:19:55,641
Are we gonna get in
trouble being out here?

1216
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,416
- I won't tell if you don't.

1217
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:00,782
[Laughs]

1218
01:20:01,947 --> 01:20:06,123
So, you were pretty obsessed
with me in high school, huh?

1219
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,023
[Sighs]

1220
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,827
I mean you did buy my
old drums from my mom.

1221
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,198
Your mom donated them!

1222
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:15,252
You kept them.

1223
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:18,035
Well I did like your band.

1224
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:22,778
Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what
you thought of me that night!

1225
01:20:23,702 --> 01:20:28,845
I should have been ﬂattered, I..., why did you
ask me out on stage? In front of everybody?

1226
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,410
Okay, because my friend
dared me to do that.

1227
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:35,222
Yeah, and you could have let me down
a little bit, you know, smoother.

1228
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,418
Yeah, that wasn't one of my
classier moments, was it?

1229
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:43,165
Well, I do hope that me
giving you are ride in my car tonight

1230
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:45,871
helps to sooth some of those
high school wounds.

1231
01:20:46,658 --> 01:20:47,834
It doesn't.

1232
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:53,432
- You want me to tell you what does?
- Yeah, please do.

1233
01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:55,372
You teaching Eli how to swim.

1234
01:20:56,535 --> 01:20:57,673
He really likes you.

1235
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,887
So what happens next?

1236
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:12,582
You mean when he goes back
to his world

1237
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,158
and we go back to ours?

1238
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:19,963
- Yeah. No.
- It's hard.

1239
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:21,697
So what do you do?

1240
01:21:22,594 --> 01:21:24,301
I pray that God
will watch over them.

1241
01:21:25,897 --> 01:21:27,706
Yeah. Not me.

1242
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,340
Not you?

1243
01:21:33,772 --> 01:21:36,902
I prayed.
When I was a kid.

1244
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:39,604
I asked Him for things.

1245
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,523
- And he didn't answer?

1246
01:21:46,551 --> 01:21:48,326
No, no.
He answered.

1247
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,696
He let my dad die.

1248
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,365
He didn't save him from cancer.

1249
01:21:59,898 --> 01:22:01,400
I'm sorry.

1250
01:22:04,936 --> 01:22:07,246
Yeah, I haven't talked
to God much since then.

1251
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:11,453
- God can love us no matter
what our situation.

1252
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:15,615
That means, it's whether
we can feel it, or not.

1253
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:17,983
And that's what
you tell these kids here?

1254
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,327
I hope you're right about Him.

1255
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:27,228
Me too.

1256
01:22:39,104 --> 01:22:41,710
Do you want
to get into some more trouble?

1257
01:22:42,507 --> 01:22:43,693
Come on.

1258
01:22:46,511 --> 01:22:47,587
Hey Roy!

1259
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:49,527
This isn't what it looks like.

1260
01:22:50,482 --> 01:22:51,984
Yes it is!

1261
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:54,425
I don't even want to know.

1262
01:23:01,826 --> 01:23:02,929
[Splash]

1263
01:23:04,162 --> 01:23:05,369
[Cheers]

1264
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:06,834
Keep kicking!

1265
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:12,641
[Cheering]
- Come on Eli!

1266
01:23:22,213 --> 01:23:23,856
- Yeah!
[Cheers]

1267
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:30,097
You did it! You did it, Eli!
That was amazing!

1268
01:23:31,156 --> 01:23:32,676
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

1269
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,925
I'm so proud of you, kid.
Really.

1270
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,767
See, you're a real fighter.

1271
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:39,025
Dad?
- Hey!

1272
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:40,679
Get your hands of my kid.

1273
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:42,034
Who's this guy
and wha...

1274
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,579
Get your damn hands
off my kid!

1275
01:23:43,668 --> 01:23:44,823
No, dad,
I didn't mean for you to come.

1276
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:46,823
Shut up boy, you called me.
I'm taking you home.

1277
01:23:48,873 --> 01:23:50,393
Bonnie, get the kids out of here, now!

1278
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:55,975
- Let's get him to the nurses station.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1279
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,554
- Keep touching him
and I'll kill you!

1280
01:23:57,582 --> 01:23:59,061
- Shut up, dad!
Shut up!

1281
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:01,407
- Somebody call the cops.

1282
01:24:01,464 --> 01:24:02,568
Get off me!

1283
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:08,496
- Hey Jenny.

1284
01:24:10,562 --> 01:24:13,198
What's going on here?
What happened?

1285
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:15,073
His father showed up.

1286
01:24:18,203 --> 01:24:19,204
Hey.
You okay Eli?

1287
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,442
Just leave me alone.

1288
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,044
- You don't have to be embar...
- Just leave, just leave.

1289
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:28,054
Okay, buddy.
I'll be outside, alright?

1290
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,520
- It's going to hurt a little bit, okay?

1291
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,629
Anybody want to tell me
what that was about?

1292
01:24:33,752 --> 01:24:35,959
- He's pushing you away.
- What?

1293
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,510
We're friends.
I mean...,

1294
01:24:38,577 --> 01:24:39,757
I don't get it.

1295
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,134
I have to call Locustwood.

1296
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:43,158
I wanna know, how did he
even know he was here?

1297
01:24:43,261 --> 01:24:46,299
- I don't think it was Locustwood.
- What do you mean?

1298
01:24:46,564 --> 01:24:48,168
He said something about Eli calling him.

1299
01:24:48,299 --> 01:24:50,973
Eli can't call him.
Eli doesn't have access to a...

1300
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,589
Three thirty in the morning?

1301
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,024
Do you know this number?

1302
01:25:11,956 --> 01:25:14,095
No, no I don't know
that number.

1303
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,662
See, this is why we don't
allow cell phones here.

1304
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,671
Huh, how do you know
Tammie's aunt?

1305
01:25:20,832 --> 01:25:21,936
What are you talking about?

1306
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,073
- Margaret Summerfield.

1307
01:25:23,126 --> 01:25:25,471
You've got a bunch
of missed calls from her.

1308
01:25:25,837 --> 01:25:28,215
She's a huge financial
supporter of our camp.

1309
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:32,221
Why is my aunt calling you?

1310
01:25:36,014 --> 01:25:39,299
She's umm... she's been in the market
for a new financial advisor,

1311
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,194
and I found out that she's...

1312
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,425
No. No, just...

1313
01:25:44,022 --> 01:25:46,002
Tammie, Tammie.

1314
01:25:50,161 --> 01:25:53,802
Hey. Hey. Wait a minute.
Let me expla...

1315
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:57,039
Are you serious?! That's why
you wanted to come to camp?

1316
01:25:57,836 --> 01:26:03,115
You used me. You used these kids.
For my great aunt's money?

1317
01:26:04,843 --> 01:26:06,686
Look, I did not come to camp initially...

1318
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,614
- Well,
it looked worse than it was.

1319
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,285
No stitches
so he should be good to go.

1320
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:15,563
Hey buddy, look.
You got your arm band.

1321
01:26:16,688 --> 01:26:17,802
It's your fault!

1322
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:24,367
- Go follow him!

1323
01:26:25,803 --> 01:26:26,839
No.

1324
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:29,029
No.

1325
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:32,579
This isn't right.

1326
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:36,474
What did you expect, huh?

1327
01:26:37,182 --> 01:26:41,008
That years of pain would somehow
magically disappear in a week.

1328
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:43,081
That you could fix him
in a couple of days?

1329
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,064
So your just going to
give up on him now, huh?

1330
01:26:52,493 --> 01:26:53,498
Great.

1331
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:57,232
- My fish is going to be bigger
than your entire head.

1332
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,468
It's going to jump out of the boat.
- Mine's going to be bigger.

1333
01:26:59,564 --> 01:27:01,874
Ours is going to be bigger.
[Engine revs]

1334
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,497
Come on.

1335
01:27:14,879 --> 01:27:16,256
Hey, look who made dinner.

1336
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,395
Where's Ken?

1337
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,807
We haven't seen him.

1338
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:25,824
Good.

1339
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:31,637
We'll keep an eye on him.

1340
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:36,378
Hey sweetie,
you don't want to lose this.

1341
01:27:38,236 --> 01:27:40,512
Eli.
You want something to eat?

1342
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:46,385
Look, Eli, Bothean tree worms.
Delicious and nutritious.

1343
01:27:46,778 --> 01:27:47,950
Shut up, freak.

1344
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:56,823
Do you want to do anything, Eli?
It's our last activity for the week.

1345
01:27:57,217 --> 01:27:58,330
- No.

1346
01:27:58,516 --> 01:28:01,794
Crawdads, canoes?
What do you say, soldier?

1347
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,369
I wish I never came.

1348
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:05,440
Come on, chin up.

1349
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:11,174
[Truck backing up beep]

1350
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,814
Camp Pine Lake, are you
ready to have a party?

1351
01:28:19,945 --> 01:28:23,258
Because my friend Eli's never
had a birthday party before

1352
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:27,460
and I thought today would be
a great day to celebrate it.

1353
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:30,163
What do you think?

1354
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,829
[Cheers]

1355
01:28:31,943 --> 01:28:33,276
You came back?

1356
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:34,969
Happy Birthday, Eli.

here take this blanket

you can sleep with it.
You know, a week long.

this special stitching on it

that keeps you invisible

It protects you when you are asleep.

1521

And she is like, okay.
And she like slept with the blanket

1522

for like
the entire week.

1523

And, uh,
she then even,

1524

like for most of the nights.

What can I do, to help you?

01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:17,733
And started crying.
And um,

1529
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:19,978
And um, I have, you know
my father actually was an alcoholic.

1530
01:43:20,927 --> 01:43:22,927
We hugged
and we cried together.

1531
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:25,536
And we prayed
for our fathers together.

1532
01:43:25,727 --> 01:43:27,978
And as we walking up
to the dining comments

1533
01:43:28,011 --> 01:43:31,560
I was complaining to my wife
that I did not want to be on a camp

1534
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,813
for abused children
on my birthday.

1535
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:37,154
And from behind us
I heard this little guy speak up

1536
01:43:37,264 --> 01:43:39,264
and he said:
I never have had a birthday.

1537
01:43:40,428 --> 01:43:42,327
What you mean you never had
a birthday. I mean,

1538
01:43:42,351 --> 01:43:43,661
it was so,

1539
01:43:43,685 --> 01:43:46,712
it was so much a given,
you know, in my life.

1540
01:43:46,737 --> 01:43:48,495
So I ran into town,

1541
01:43:48,759 --> 01:43:52,344
uh, to, to the Kmart here
and I got him a watch.

1542
01:43:52,638 --> 01:43:57,255
And my wife said just, you know that,
it literally changed Royal Family forever.

1543
01:43:57,437 --> 01:44:00,167
She said I wonder
how many other kids here

1544
01:44:00,596 --> 01:44:02,596
don't experienced
a birthday party.

1545
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:05,769
And we found out,
none of the children,

1546
01:44:06,026 --> 01:44:08,466
none of the kids
we took to camp that year

1547
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:10,353
had ever had
a birtday party.

1548
01:44:10,524 --> 01:44:12,778
And this counselor says: okay,
George wants to go

1549
01:44:12,803 --> 01:44:14,949
do the swimt est.
And he is doing his dog peddling

1550
01:44:15,018 --> 01:44:19,436
kicking like crazy. Everyone in
the pool area is cheering him on.

1551
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,166
- There was so much screaming...
- Just screaming 'Go George, go George',

1552
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:27,066
 'Go George', it was like he just got
a gold medal it the Olympics.

1553
01:44:27,229 --> 01:44:29,366
Okay,
he gets his band,

1554
01:44:29,842 --> 01:44:32,522
and it's just,
it's like, his.

1555
01:44:32,966 --> 01:44:34,452
The best treasure
he could ever have.

1556
01:44:34,476 --> 01:44:36,159
He worked with this counselor
to be,

1557
01:44:36,356 --> 01:44:38,092
to be able to do that,
to archive that.

1558
01:44:38,369 --> 01:44:40,572
Lot of kids don't,
they come to our camp

1559
01:44:40,935 --> 01:44:42,935
they don't get
that positive reinforcement.

1560
01:44:42,978 --> 01:44:46,174
I have never seen the boys
eat more bacon

1561
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:48,974
at any other place in the word
than on a Royal Family kids camp,

1562
01:44:48,998 --> 01:44:50,267
it's disgusting.

1563
01:44:50,356 --> 01:44:51,366
They will,

1564
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:54,739
they will pile their plate up with bacon
and they will consume

1565
01:44:55,176 --> 01:44:56,992
the whole plate.

1566
01:44:57,102 --> 01:44:59,102
I said well that's dangerous,
yep, it probably is.

1567
01:44:59,656 --> 01:45:01,419
She couldn't read,
uh,

1568
01:45:01,869 --> 01:45:04,432
she hadn't been to school,
she wasn't in school.

1569
01:45:04,774 --> 01:45:07,164
So, I would sit there with her
each night and read her,

1570
01:45:07,188 --> 01:45:09,944
her letters and stuff,
and, uh,

1571
01:45:10,815 --> 01:45:13,751
you know, and I saw her face like,
as I was reading him to her

1572
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:15,604
she is like balance
for me.

1573
01:45:15,628 --> 01:45:18,464
And I was like,
yeah, balance for me

1574
01:45:18,488 --> 01:45:21,511
She said can someone else help me
because I want to write you something

1575
01:45:21,535 --> 01:45:25,498
and she actually took all the time
and effort to sit there and write out

1576
01:45:25,567 --> 01:45:28,973
you know, thank you for being
my camp counselor, I'm going miss you

1577
01:45:28,997 --> 01:45:30,997
see you, and I had
a great time at camp.

1578
01:45:31,621 --> 01:45:35,124
I cried the whole way home.
And, uh,

1579
01:45:41,505 --> 01:45:44,065
it's weird I haven't
remembered this

1580
01:45:44,288 --> 01:45:45,483
since last year.

1581
01:45:48,506 --> 01:45:50,100
So, um...,

1582
01:45:51,016 --> 01:45:52,154
I got home,

1583
01:45:52,778 --> 01:45:55,087
and I told Jessica,
um...,

1584
01:45:56,497 --> 01:45:59,521
we have to,
we have to find this boy Michael.

1585
01:45:59,805 --> 01:46:02,848
We, we sat out a mentorship program
that we were able too.

1586
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:06,274
We talked to him every week
and see him.

1587
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:09,181
Trough that process we found out
he needed a home,

1588
01:46:09,205 --> 01:46:11,505
and was needing
to be adopted.

1589
01:46:11,537 --> 01:46:14,937
And it didn't take long
until we decided that

1590
01:46:14,962 --> 01:46:17,659
we needed to be that home
and adopted him.

1591
01:46:18,367 --> 01:46:20,723
Creating a safe place
for these kids for a week

1592
01:46:20,747 --> 01:46:24,621
it just be, who they are in love
them exactly where they are at

1593
01:46:24,646 --> 01:46:26,923
is probably the most powerful thing
we can do for them.

1594
01:46:26,948 --> 01:46:28,947
You feel like, you're poking
the devil in the eye.

1595
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,000
Yeah,
that's what it's like.

1596
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:33,914
Know what you are doing,
you punch them right in the nose.

1597
01:46:34,004 --> 01:46:36,090
That's what it's like,
you stand right up there

1598
01:46:36,115 --> 01:46:38,334
and you grab them by the throat
and punch them right on the nose.

1599
01:46:38,562 --> 01:46:39,915
That's what we do
every week.

1600
01:46:40,058 --> 01:46:42,404
Come to camp.
It's one week

1601
01:46:42,915 --> 01:46:43,761
and,

1602
01:46:44,051 --> 01:46:46,515
it can really make a difference
in the life of a child.

1603
01:46:46,539 --> 01:46:48,539
We asked ourselves:

1604
01:46:49,075 --> 01:46:51,902
have we done anything
that's been this hard ever in our life?

1605
01:46:52,578 --> 01:46:53,485
No.

1606
01:46:54,662 --> 01:46:57,465
So we sat around.
We cried out every tear we had.

1607
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:58,613
We, uh,

1608
01:46:59,024 --> 01:47:01,773
we loved the children
to the best of our ability

1609
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:03,797
as we went around the world
we all said

1610
01:47:04,306 --> 01:47:06,306
[Sighs]
I don't think I can do it again.

1611
01:47:07,402 --> 01:47:08,988
And then someone said it:

1612
01:47:10,011 --> 01:47:11,449
'How can we not?'

1613
01:47:13,525 --> 01:47:15,525
Yeah.
How can we not do it again.

1614
01:47:17,613 --> 01:47:19,613
[Music orchestral]

1615
01:49:09,557 --> 01:49:10,814
The End
