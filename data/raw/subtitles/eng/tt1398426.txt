00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,631
Now, you take a backseat
to that shit, nigga.

335
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,279
These fuckin'
marching jackets and shit.

336
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,432
Marching, my ass. You march your ass
and do what the fuck I say.

337
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,239
Hey, Dre.

338
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,234
Don't even trip on him, homey.

339
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,596
Nigga ain't got
no fucking vision, man.

340
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,593
That's why I'm-a fuck his bitch
right after he leaves.

341
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,752
<i>Not with that shit on.</i>

342
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,150
Hey!

343
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,153
- Dr. Dre.
- What's up, E?

344
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,919
It's been a minute, man.

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,674
I love your jacket, by the way.

346
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,114
You baggin' on me.

347
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,795
You know I don't like wearing this shit.

348
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,839
That's Lonzo's shit, man.
You know it's part of the gig.

349
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,350
You remember the homey,
Ren from Kelly Park, right?

350
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,590
- What's up?
- What up, Dre?

351
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,319
- What up?
- What's up, man?

352
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,952
Look, I heard you been, um, spending
some time at your auntie house.

353
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,713
How's the couch life?

354
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,314
It's fucked up.
I'm too tall for that shit.

355
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,313
Plus, I got my woman
and baby living there. It's hard, man.

356
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,631
But you know, everybody
can't do what you do.

357
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,951
But what I do gettin'
played out quick, man.

358
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,033
Motherfuckers is gettin' locked up
and laid down out here, you know?

359
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,794
- Gonna make some changes.
- Changes ain't bad.

360
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,554
Thinking about making
a few changes myself.

361
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,233
What you mean?

362
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,079
What you think about dumping some money
into this music shit?

363
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,799
Look, I got some ideas.

364
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,349
Let's give it up for Dr. Dre!

365
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,399
- I gotta get back up there.
- That's your calling, man.

366
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,392
Tell Lonzo I said, "Fuck him. "

367
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,915
All right. Hey, E.

368
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,719
Think about it.

369
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,359
All right.

370
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,318
<i>Funk]</i>

371
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,073
- What's up? Do I know you?
- What?

372
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,594
- Get 'em up.
- Hell no!

373
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,752
Hey, don't be fuckin'
with my little brother, nigga!

374
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,390
- What the fuck did he do?
- Nigga lookin' at me like he know me or somethin'.

375
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,995
Man, I told you about this shit!

376
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,720
- Clear the parking lot.
- I told you to go the fuck home.

377
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,998
- The fuck wrong with you, man?
- You better chill the fuck out.

378
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,759
One time.

379
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,119
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!

380
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,680
We just standing here.

381
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,240
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get outta here!

382
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,551
- What's going on?
- Hey! Hey! Head home!

383
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,199
I fell.

384
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,397
You fell? He fell?

385
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,114
That's what he said.

386
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,274
I didn't ask you what he said.
Get the fuck home!

387
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,712
<i>I am home.</i>

388
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,951
Head home! Go!

389
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,551
If you don't start walking...

390
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,793
Or what?

391
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,315
Turn around. Hands on your head.

392
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
- Come on.
- Fuck.

393
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,473
You have the right to remain silent.

394
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,792
Stop resisting, boy!

395
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,111
- What up, sucker-punch?
- You already know what it is.

396
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,510
Sucker-punched that dude, man.

397
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,671
Hey, man, nah, nah. That was Tyree.

398
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,672
You know he got that temper and shit.

399
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,515
- Always getting me into fucking trouble, man.
- What they lock you up for?

400
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,515
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.

401
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,512
As far as they was concerned.

402
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,592
That's the gangsterist shit
I heard all week.

403
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,149
Man, it's stupid.

404
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,153
Well, I was thinking about what you was
saying last night though, man.

405
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,038
Oh, yeah?

406
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,713
And?

407
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,557
- It's interesting.
- How long?

408
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,031
Really, like, how long do you think
that shit you doing out there gonna last?

409
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,033
'Cause it ain't no happy endings
in that game, man.

410
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,796
You saying a lot for a nigga
who just got bailed outta jail.

411
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,315
- I'm just saying, if you can slang dope...
- Nigga!

412
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,871
- What, man?
- Just tell the whole fuckin' world I sell dope.

413
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,670
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.

414
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,320
You got a mind for that shit, E.

415
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,478
- So what you talkin' about doing? Li'I homey from last night?
- Nah, man.

416
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,553
He in a group. You know, they a trip, but...

417
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,552
But that shit, the reality raps,

418
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,836
that's what I'm talking about, man.

419
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,320
That's it.

420
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,076
My boy, D.O.C., he coming in
from Dallas, dope.

421
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,720
- My little homey, Ren, rap too.
- Oh, yeah?

422
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,678
Hey, look, I got these cats...

423
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,831
H.B.O. Home Boys Only.

424
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,231
From New York. Dope voices, man.

425
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,670
Some wack-ass lyrics though, man.

426
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,835
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em. It's crazy.

427
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,674
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.

428
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,037
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.

429
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,600
A label?

430
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,751
That's kinda fuckin' farfetched, Dre.

431
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,593
Yeah, but check this out.

432
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,673
What would you call
a record label like that?

433
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,354
Ruthless.

434
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,079
Ruthless?

435
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,957
- Just like these fucking police, nigga.
- Ruthless.

436
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,952
Let's get the fuck from around here.

437
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,952
Trying to get me sent to jail.

438
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,872
Get your simple ass in the car.

439
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,636
<i>Rap Beat]</i>

440
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,438
What the fuck is "gankin'"?
And what's a "6-4"?

441
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,874
- Yeah.
- It's a car.

442
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,474
A 6-4 Impala.

443
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,597
"Gankin'" is when you jack somebody, man.

444
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,479
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.

445
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,234
Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.

446
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,758
- Besides, who gives a fuck about Compton anyway?
- Hey, hold the fuck up.

447
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,829
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?

448
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,992
'Cause we might have
a problem up in this bitch.

449
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,270
Huh? No?

450
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,751
Then do the lyrics,
'cause I'm really losing my patience.

451
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,911
<i>A'ight? Stop fuckin' embarrassing me, man.</i>

- Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.

- Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.
- Fuck you!

454
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,280
- Wearing a Kangol don't make you LL Cool J, nigga.
- Fuck you gonna do about it?

455
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,472
- What you gonna
do, mark-ass nigga? - Hey.

456
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,473
Let's roll, B.

457
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,954
- B-street-lookin' motherfucker.
- Fucking Jheri curl-ass.

458
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,033
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.

459
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,873
- Well, there goes the talent, Dre.
- Shut the fuck up, E.

460
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,555
- I'm just sayin'.
- All right.

461
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,519
How the fuck we 'posed
to make a record label and hit records...

462
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,557
and we ain't got no talent?

463
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,635
I mean, you said hold up my side of
the deal. You said put some money up.

464
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,030
<i>So it's time for you to deliver.</i>

465
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,715
Why don't you do this shit, E?

466
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,476
Nah, for real. Get in there on the mike.
You ain't got shit to lose.

467
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,512
It's your money. You paying for it.

468
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,310
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.

469
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,512
I'm in a group already, man. Jinx and
them would trip on me if I do anything.

470
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,990
I understand that you wanna
keep throwing your life away...

471
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,675
with Jinx and the backyard boogie band
or whatever,

472
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,036
but I'm the Berry Gordy of this shit.

473

So, whenever y'all figure out
what y'all wanna do, just let me know.

You ain't doing nothing.

481
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,754
But you the businessman,
so, you know, it's on you.

482
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,792
We got a cold-ass song though.

483

I think you could hit that shit.

484
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,234
I'm not sold, Dre.

485
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,313
What you mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?

486
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,790
You're kinda being
a ho right now, Eric.

Fuck y'all niggas.

488

- What are you doing?
- E, let me produce. Man.

What the fuck is so funny?

496
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,515
Nothing. Not...
Oh, E, can you hear me?

00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,672
Yeah, I can hear you and how much

498
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,479
- No.
- Hey, E, you good.

499
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,997
Just hit that first beat hard, man.
You gotta come in on beat.

500
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,437
<i>Cruisin' down the street.
You cruisin'.</i>

501
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,000
- You good, Eric.
- A'ight? Hey.

502
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,198
- No, no, no, no. You good, you good.
- It's dope.

503
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,839
But on beat.

504
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,877
Again. All right? Let's go.

505
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,634
Cruisin'. All right?

506
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,870
# Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 #

507
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,872
Shit. - That ain't it.

508
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,519
It really ain't.

509
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,479
Hey, hey, Dre. He gotta go if we're gonna
do this. Cube, you gotta go.

510
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,712
- Get the fuck outta here, Yella.
- Now, nigga. Both y'all.

511
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,359
- You talking to me?
- Bye!

512
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,636
- Go, Cube! Yella, get the fuck outta here.
- Me too?

513
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,632
Yeah, so we can get this shit done.

514
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,030
"Write the song, Cube.
Shut the fuck up, Cube. "

515
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,793
Take these with you, Cube.

516
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,196
Yella. Yes, man. Come on.

517
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,318
You know what? Whatever.
Whatever.

518
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,392
- You motherfucker.
- Come on, E.

519
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,076
You finished, Dre? You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.

520
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,992
Hey, just say the words. A'ight?

521
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,312
- What does that even mean?
- Man, just say the shit with me. All right? Cruisin'.

522
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,710
- Cruisin'!
- Yeah, cruisin'. Let's go.

523
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,912
# Dre, you know this shit
ain't gonna never work #

524
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,674
A'ight, you... you trying to be funny.

525
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,195
But you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.

526
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,273
<i>- Yeah, I believe that shit.
- Then say this shit like you believe it, man.</i>

527
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,673
Like it's a motherfuckin' Sunday and you
cruisin' down Crenshaw in a motherfuckin' 6-4.

528
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,719
Come on. Say that shit like you
believe it, man. Like it's your words.

529
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,032
Feel that shit. Stop playing
around. Loosen the fuck up.

530
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,397
<i>There you go.</i>

531
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,955
# Cruisin' down the street

532
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,556
Oh, shit. Hey, that was dope, E.

533
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,030
That shit was dope, man. Yeah!

534
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,476
That's what I'm talking about, man.

535
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,711
You feelin' that shit, right?

536
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,476
Now we only got 59 more lines to punch in.
But it's all good. We gonna get through it.

537
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,438
Let's go on to the next one.

538
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,954
<i>Jump in!</i>

539
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,635
<i># I went to get them out

<i># Kilo G on trial

543
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,276
<i># "Disruption of the court, "
said the judge #</i>

544
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,398
<i># On a six-year sentence
my man didn't budge #</i>

545
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,915
<i># Bailiff came over

546
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,754
<i># Kilo G looked up
and gave a grin #</i>

547
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,480
<i># He yelled out "Fire!"

548
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,752

555
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,273
- Yes!
- All right!

556
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,829
- Yes!
- All right, Eazy.

557
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,360
Hell yes, Dre!

558
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,159
- Yeah?
- Whoo! Yes.

559
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,031
Hey, D.O.C. What you think? You think
they gonna feel that shit in Dallas?

560
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,273
- Man, to be honest, man, that shit is super dope, nigga.
- Hell yeah!

561
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,794
For real, nigga.

562
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,600
Hey, Lonzo. What you think?

563
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,196
Sound like some
waste-of-time shit to me.

564
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,638
Look, this shit ain't gon' work. You ain't gon'
get no radio play with that shit right there.

565
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,632
<i>- Oh, for real?
- Oh, for very real.</i>

566
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,396
Wrap this shit up. I need you to get back
on that slow jam we talked about.

567
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,791
This whole reality rap shit y'all tryin' to do,
talkin' about low riders and jail,

568
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,792
don't nobody wanna hear that shit.

569
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,159
You need to get back in there and work on
that slow jam that we worked on. I'm serious.

570
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,153
About all you motherfuckers taking up
my time, and that's coming out your pay.

571
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,152
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.

572
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,550
But you, motherfucker,
I ain't gonna take that shit from you.

573
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,757
20 years from now,
you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.

574
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,834
20 years from now, you still gonna be
recording love songs in this dusty-ass garage.

575
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,072
Get the fuck outta here.

576
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,231
- Wrap this shit up.
- Get your ass out.

577
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,391
Yeah, okay. You got it.

578
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,160
<i>No, you got it!</i>

579
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,840
- Yes!
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?

580
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,354
You told me, man.
I should've believed you.

581
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,717
What the fuck did you all get from that
that you're high-fiving and shit?

582
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,792
Cube. If Lonzo
think it ain't gonna be shit,

583
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,837
we know we got
a motherfucking hit!

584
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,389
- Exactly.
- 'Cause he don't know shit about music.

585
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,278
He don't know
good music when he hears it.

586
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,195
- Play that shit again!
- Dre, you a fucking genius.

587
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,873
You a fucking genius.

588
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,997
# Went to the park

589
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,595

Whoo! These phones are burning up.

602
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,789
This is 1580 KDAY.

603
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,556
This is Greg Mack with the Mack Attack,
and I gotta give it up to my boy, Dr. Dre,

604
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,429
who's coming with Compton's
very own Eazy-E.

605
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,239
And you're listening
to "Boyz-N-The-Hood",

606
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,149
<i>the number-one-requested song
for six weeks and counting.</i>

607
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,355
A'ight. Guess I'll see you soon.

608
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,511
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

609
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,069
I heard your record.

610
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,039
- I'm Jerry Heller.
- Eric Wright.

611
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,635
- Real pleasure to meet you, man.
- Same here.

612
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,474
Uh, would it...

613
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,553
Here, let me get those for you.
Let me get those for you.

614
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,839
Would it be possible to have a word
with you for a second, Eric?

615
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,673
About what?

616
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,433
About music.

617
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,073
- After you.
- All right. Come on.

618
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,672
- So, I thought your album was good, man.
- Just good?

619
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,592
Mmm.

620
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,158
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No.

621
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,311
I thought it was exceptional.

622
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,517
- Exceptional?
- Yes. Fantastic.

623
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,877
Please, just sit down.
All right? We'll start this again.

624
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,917
Come on. All right.

625
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,637
I'm... I'm gonna try this again.

626
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,320
- Okay?
- All right.

627
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,719
As a music manager, let me tell you
what I can do for you, Eric.

628
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,554
I will make you legit.

629
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,078
It seems as if I could
do something for you.

630
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,994
I see.

631
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,960
You think because I don't have some flashy
office, I don't know what I'm talking about?

632
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,556
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

633
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,840
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.

634
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,994
- I worked with...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?

635
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,075
Okay.

636
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,278
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.

637
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,711
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.

638
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
Bravado.

639
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,317
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

640
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,471
you think anybody is gonna
let you in the building...

641
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,110
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?

642
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,715
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.

643
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,711
That is what I can do for you.

644
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,917
I can make you legit.

645
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,437
I can get you in that building,
and I will protect you.

646
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,673
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business,

647
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,195
and we can build something big.

648
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,830
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you,

649
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,798
the way that I believe in this.

650
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,954
Because you have a unique talent, Eric.
Very special.

651
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,713
Don't fuck around.

652
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,390
But you know what?

653
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,674
If you can't handle it,

654
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,559
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.

655
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,717
- Get outta here.
- Wait.

656
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,039
I'm listening.

657
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,557
You got more music for me?

658
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,080
- Absolutely.
- Good.

659
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,200
'Cause you are gonna have
to follow this up quick.

660
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,714
All right?

661
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,476
Now, what does N.W.A stand for, huh?

662
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,756
No Whites Allowed? Something like that?

663
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,877
Nah.

664
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,435
Niggaz Wit Attitudes.

665
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,359
You're fucking kidding me

666
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,752
All right. We can work with that.

667
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,509
- Good. I like that. I like that a lot.
- You better.

668
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,553
Fantastic.

669
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,840
Fantastic.

670
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,754
Hey, what up?

671
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,152
- What's up, fam?
- Yeah!

672
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,680
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?

673
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,353
Dre!

674
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,954
All right. Okay.

675
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,672
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea why I
asked y'all to wear all black tonight?

676
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,513
'Cause we a all-star group.

677
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,240
And to be a all-star group,
we gotta look like it,

678
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,074
sound like it, dress like it.

679
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,755
You mind tellin' me
what the fuck happened in your situation?

680
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,514
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.

681
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,752
- That's saying a lot about how you live.
- We getting paid to wear all black?

682
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,269
Look, I ain't lookin' out
for your ass no more, man. Put this on.

683
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,115
- Oh, shit. There go Mr. Drummond.
- Nah, nah.

684
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
<i>That's Mr. Furley from Three's Company.</i>

685
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,480
Hey, that's good, Ren.

686
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,880
Y'all finished?

687
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,714
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around,

688
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,076
trying to get money for Ruthless.

689
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,550
He tryin' to get us distribution.
He tryin' to get us on tour.

690
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,553
He could probably bring some real money to
the table, so let's take this shit serious.

691
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,074
Okay. And then what, E?

692
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,271
All he do is take 20 off the top.

693
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,431
We cut 80, but that's how managers work.

694
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,991
Fellas, all right. I'm sorry I'm late.
How's everybody doing?

695
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,713
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've had a lot of passes.

696
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,795
Uh, people are scared of you guys.
Big time.

697
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,872
They think that you're dangerous.

698
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,395
Uh, I happen to think
that that's a good thing.

699
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,631
These fucking guys,
they need some more convincing.

700
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,509
They're so fucking timid.
So I invited them here to the show.

701
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,116
So you've got to kick ass tonight.

702
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,959
- Can you do that?
- Hell yeah.

703
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,760
They're gonna be here.
Scare the shit out of them.

704
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,952
Blow the fucking roof off, all right?
Have a good show.

705
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,999
Hey, can this motherfucker Jerry Heller
bring in more pussy?

706
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,390
'Cause that shit's worth 20%.

707
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,119
Hey, man. But for real though.

708
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,556
They want N.W.A?

709
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,314
- Let's give 'em N.W.A.
- Hell yeah!

710
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,392
- A'ight?
- A'ight!

711
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,314
Let's go get this money!

712
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,310
Now everybody say "Yeah!"

713
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,629
Yeah!

714
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,280
- Hell yeah!
- Hell yeah!

715
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,593
Louder! Scream!

716
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,680
# It was once said by a man

717
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,116
# "Dopeman, please,
can I have another hit?" #

718
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,317

"Cluck, I don't give a shit #

719

That's the name of the game #

760
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,995
Jerry, you're my friend.
But Compton? I don't think so.

761
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,514
Queens, maybe.

762
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,594
Listen, if you find the next Bon Jovi,
call me, okay? Good luck.

763
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,875
- All right. Thanks for coming.
- Sure thing.

Jesus Christ!

771
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,351
You wrecked these motherfuckers
tonight, boy.

772
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,392
The stage was shaking so much, I thought
my needle's about to jump off the record!

773
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,312
Yo, I was trippin' off them knowing
the words though. That shit was crazy!

774
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,314
Hey, yo, I'm tellin' you,
Compton is definitely on the map, yo.

775
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,710
- Damn right.
- That's for damn sure.

776
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,190
Man, I figured you were
gonna represent tonight.

777
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,634
- Good shit, my nigga.
- What up?

778
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,076
What you been up to?
You still out there in Vegas?

779
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,072
- This Suge.
- What's up?

780
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,198
Man, I just been back and forth, man,
doing some security, bodyguard work.

781
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,000
- Oh.
- Y'all need my services, let me know.

782
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,833
Security?

783
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,072
I don't think we gon' need no bodyguards.
We might got that covered.

784
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,391
Yeah!

785
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,598
But you never know
what you need until you need it.

786
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,831
I just came here to give y'all props.

787
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,991
Got people waitin' on me.

788
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,554
Excuse me.

789
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,678
Uh, okay, that was...

790
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,433
one hell of a show.

791
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,840
Whoo!

792
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,749
Nice job. Very, very nice, gentlemen.
Outstanding!

793
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,113
You kicked ass. Yeah, you did.
You definitely did.

794
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,513
Okay, uh, this is Eazy-E
and N.W.A, obviously.

795
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,030
- Guys, this is Bryan Turner.
- How you doin', fellas?

796
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,554
- Ice Cube.
- Oh. Pleasure.

797
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,474
Bryan runs Priority Records,

798
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,472
and he wants to sign you.

799
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,916
Yeah, immediately.

800
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,310
Look, fellas, I gotta say,
I loved the show.

801
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,394
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

802
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,949
So I think, honestly,
if you all wanted to,

803
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,952
you guys would fit perfectly
with our label.

804
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,594
- Yes.
- That'll work!

805
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,594
- That'll work. - Nah, nah, nah,
nah. No, it w... Hold on, man.

806
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,911
I mean, Priority Records.

807
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,639
I've never heard of it. What you got?

808
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,509
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?

809
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,479
Run-D.M.C.?
You know what I'm saying?

810
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,517
- Whoa, boys.
- Or is it more R & B?

811
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,637
You know... Prince, Michael Jackson.

812
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,951
- It's a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.

813
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,111
More R & B as of right now, but...

814
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,272
Yeah, we represent nothing big,
but mostly R & B.

815
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,637
- Who dat?
- It's, uh, California Raisins.

816
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,797
The raisins from the commercial singing
"I Heard it Through the Grapevine" and shit?

817
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,837
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.

818
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,877
That would be the one.

819
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,031
Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

820
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,080
I was laughing, too, I promise.
Then I started cashing checks.

821
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,076
So, look, uh, I gotta tell ya, those
little fuckers, they went gold last year.

822
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,072
- Gold?
- Yeah, almost platinum.

823
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,516
- Yeah.
- What do you say, fellas?

824
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,399
You wanna go make a record?

00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,915
He seriously dug it. He really dug it.

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,514
- You did it, Jerry.
- He did.

829
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,920
<i>- Thank you, man.
- You did it.</i>

830
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,956
All right, so look.

Your rhymes ain't tight,
it ain't makin' the record.

832
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,400
This ain't Lonzo's shit.
This the real deal. A'ight?

847
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,593
# And for this reason
I'm a walkin' threat #

848
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,514
<i>- # So when I'm on stage, I want... #

849
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,953

- Hell yeah, Dre.
- Yeah, man!

858
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,197
You feel that shit, right?
Hey, check this out.

859
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,715
<i>Fuck it up.</i>

860
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,998
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about, man.

861
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,474
But you hear the difference, right?

862
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,632
- Yeah, way better than the shit I came up with.
- I know.

863
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,280
Excuse me, gentlemen.

864
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,272
I thought you'd like to know...

865
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,591
our deal
with Priority Records is done.

866
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,875
- Yes!
- Yes!

867
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,952
- Okay?
- That's what's up, man!

868
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,430
- Contracts right here for you to sign.
- Thank you, my good man.

869
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,479
Music keeps sounding like this,
this album is gonna be incredible.

870
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,115
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.

871
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,510
- Very strong lyrics too, Cube.
- Thank you, Jerry.

872
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,796
- Very strong.
- Appreciate that, Jerry.

873
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,837
So what's up with our contracts though?

874
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,992
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

875
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,039
Jerry on top of that.
But did you just switch all the straws?

876
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,033
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.

877
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,117
Right now. Trust me.

878
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,799
<i>Serious.</i>

879
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,031
Uh-oh. Really?

880
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,000
- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.

881
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,391
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.

882
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,951
Let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?

883
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,560
What am I supposed to do? We're sleeping
in a twin bed at your auntie's house.

884
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,997
We have a baby, Andre. You expect me
to wait for what you doin' in there?

885
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,720
And you in the streets fuckin' around?
Are you crazy?

886
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,191
What? I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass
day and fuckin' night...

887
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,879
tryin' to create something.

888
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,674
You gonna come up in here, talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?

889
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,036
<i>- You don't get it.
- No, you don't get it, Lavetta.</i>

890
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,550
- Daddy!
- It's all right, baby.

891
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,279
Chill out, man.

892
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,038
Tyra, it's gonna be okay.
All right? All right, baby?

893
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,520
- Bye, Dre.
- Daddy love you.

894
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,910
Daddy!

895
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,354
- You cool?
- Fuck no, man. I'm far from cool.

896
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,875
- What happened, Dre? What she say?
- What'd you do?

897
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,350
- Oh, shit. Here we go again.
- Oh, shit.

898
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,631
One time. One time.

899
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,713
We cool. We ain't even doin' shit.
We not doin' shit.

900
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,233
You guys lost?

901
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,313
- Nah.
- You niggas supposed to be somewhere?

902
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,278
Yeah. Here.

903
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,079
- We working.
- Oh, you working?

904
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,879
Yeah, I'll bet.

905
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,390
- What we do?
- We'll find out in a minute what you did.

906
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,314
- What's this?
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

907
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,393
- What the fuck?
- Get your ass on the ground now.

908
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,312
Get on the ground!

909
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,837
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?

910
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,640
- What we do?
- Hey. Get down.

911
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,599
- Get on the ground. Now.
- Get your punk ass on the ground.

912
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,239
Let's go. Get the fuck down.

913
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,596
Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.

914
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,514
- This is fucked up.
- Interlock 'em!

915
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,399
- The fuck you got us on the ground like this for, Officer?
- For our protection.

916
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,752
There's seven of you and four of us. So sit tight and let us do our job.

917
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,912
- Officer, I'm sorry. What is going on?
- Sir, stay right there, please.

918
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,469
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

919
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,916
I'm sorry.
These are not bangers. Okay?

920
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,599
These are artists.

921
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,353
- Excuse me? Artists?
- Yeah.

922
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,999
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

923
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,594
- What kind of artists?
- Rappers.

924
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,115
And they're working with me
in the studio right now.

925
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,112
Well, see, rap is not an art.

926
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,793
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I'm the manager.

927
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,793
- Well, you're wasting your time, Mr. Manager.
- You gotta be kidding me.

928
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,473
- You're wasting your time.
- Really?

929
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,116
These clients of yours, these rappers,
they look like gang members.

930
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,989
You can't come down here and arrest people
just because of what they look like.

931
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,356
What, are you crazy?
That's police harassment.

932
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,077
- You said you're a manager, right? Not a fuckin' lawyer.
- Does that matter?

933
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,153
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys...

934
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,879
because they're black!

935
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,952
- People have rights!
- Step back!

936
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,040
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys. Come on. Eric!

937
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,840
You don't tell them to get up.
We will decide that.

938
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,351
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the mayor's office.

939
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,033
Step back.

940
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,073
<i>Now get up.</i>

941
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,480
Get up now!

942
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,518
- Okay. Come on, guys.
- And you keep your people in line. You understand?

943
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,115
- And the fuck out of Torrance.
- Good. Come on.

944
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,112
- You got a problem?
- It's my jersey.

945
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,034
You ain't tough now, huh?
Just get to steppin'.

946
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,032
Eric, come on. Let's go.

947
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,112
- You got a problem?
- Yella.

948
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,431
- I didn't hear you.
- Let's go.

949
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,193
You's a fuckin' sellout.

950
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,351
Shut up.

951
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,193
Everything's fine. Okay?

952
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,237
- Yeah.
- You got something to say?

953
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,552
- Cube.
- You got something to say, boy?

954
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,871
Cube. Get inside.
Let's get back to work.

955
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,634
You heard what your master said.
Get inside, boy.

956
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,030
- You shut the fuck up!
- Hey.

957
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,794
Get the fuck back inside.

958
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,278
Get inside, Cube.

959
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,795
We're gonna go back and work. Okay?
Leave us alone.

960
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,554
- You know? Leave us alone.
- Fuckin' rap music.

961
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,075
- You're fuckin' disgraceful.
- Yeah.

962
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,357
I got something for this beat.

963
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,674
<i>Hey, Yella, cut it.</i>

964
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,999
- What is it lookin' like, Dre? It's hard?
- Yo.

965
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,960
- Hell yeah, Cube.
- Yeah.

966
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,760
This gon' start some shit,
but this what we need. Hell yeah.

967
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,594
# Fuck the police

01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,838
- Fuck, man!
- Hey. Come on. Put that shit up.

1140
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,675
Excuse me! Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1141
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,390
- I don't mean to be the bearer
of bad news, but... - What you got?

1142
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,040
- Oh, shit.
- What's that?

1143
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,197
Motherfuckin' FBI.

1144
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,515
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?

1145
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,354
- Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us too?
- Kind of.

1146
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,477
I mean,
what the letter say, Jerry?

1147
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,597
Uh, basically, uh...

1148
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,956
"A song recorded
by the rap group N.W.A...

1149
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,356
<i>on their album
Straight Out Of Compton...</i>

1150
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,750
encourages violence
against law enforcement.

1151
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,036
Advocating violence
and assault is wrong,

1152
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,955
and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action. "

1153
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,474
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

1154
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,040
Fuck the law enforcement community.

1155
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,033
We got freedom of speech.
What the fuck can they do to us?

1156
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,511
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?
Because this is a warning, Cube.

1157
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,350
And it's about "Fuck Tha Police"
in particular, so,

1158
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,990
I think, uh, maybe we should
not play that song right now.

1159
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,879
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.

1160
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,475
Relax, relax. We're not giving in to anything.

1161
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,234
I just say we retire it for now.
Okay?

1162
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,835
It is a reasonably worded threat.

1163
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,559
This isn't, uh, street bullshit.

1164
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,553
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.
This is the federal government.

1165
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,235
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.

1166
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,232
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?

1167
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,552
- The fuck does that mean?
- If it was the LAPD, maybe I'd be a little worried.

1168
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,031
- But we can't let them censor us, Jerry.
- I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube.

1169
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,240
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.

1170
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,834
What you mean, E?

1171
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,912
'Cause this right here is a gift.

1172
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,391
- It's the FBI, E. What you talking about?
- This...

1173
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,240
is free publicity for N.W.A.

1174
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,835
We take this to the press
and we show them...

1175
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,992
what type of intimidation,
discrimination and harassment...

1176
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,992
that we dealing with from our government.

1177
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,753
- I like that shit.
- I'm with that.

1178
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,513
My nigga, I feel you.

1179
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,593
- If that's what you wanna do, then we can...
- That's what I wanna do.

1180
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,071
That's what we wanna do, Jerry.
That's it.

1181
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,912
That's what we wanna do.

1182
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,037
- Okay. Uh...
- Yeah?

1183
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,396
We good?

1184
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,790
- I hate to be the bearer of bad news...
- Mm-hmm?

1185
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,076
- But 20!
- Twenty, man!

1186
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,640
- Wait a minute! That ain't 20!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1187
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,478
Shh. Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.

1188
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,114
Good night, Jerry.

1189
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,557
- Compton's crap!
- Go back to Compton!

1190
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,950
Ain't that some shit.

1191
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,192
Speak a little truth,
and people lose their minds.

1192
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,879
This is not music!

1193
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,636
Shit, the truth is, they can do
whatever they want with 'em.

1194
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,393
They bought them motherfuckers.

1195
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,235
# I don't drink brass monkey,
Like the beat funky #

1196
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,233
# Nickname Eazy-E
your eight-ball junkie #

1197
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,551
# Bass drum kicking
to show my shit #

1198
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,633
# Rapping holding my dick, boy
I don't quit #

1199
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,189
# Crowd-rocking muthafucka
from around the way #

1200
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,079
# I got a six shooter,
yo' mean hombre #

1201
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,470
<i># Rolling through the hood
to find the boys #</i>

1202
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,876
<i># Kick dust and cuss
and crank up some noise #</i>

1203
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,316
<i># Police on my balls,
I had to pause #</i>

1204
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,598
<i># 40 ounce in my lap
and it's freezing my balls ##</i>

1205
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,071
<i>For the sake of our children,
I implore each of you</i>

1206
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:34,030
<i>to be unyielding and inflexible
in your opposition to drugs.</i>

1207
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,830
'Cause another one called me
and told me she's pregnant by you too.

1208
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,391
You just gotta slow down.
You can't fuck every broad on the planet.

1209
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,676
- So now pussy a problem?
- It's gonna be a problem if you got 4,000 kids.

1210
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,399
- Right?
- Yeah.

1211
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,076
You make some money, you got all these
problems, you have to take care of 'em.

1212
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,073
It's fine.
I'll help you take care of 'em.

1213
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,278
- Hey, Cube.
- Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.

1214
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,558
But what's up, E? Where the contracts
at, man? You forgot about me?

1215
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,280
Didn't I tell you to... You know what?
Jerry, you wanna deal with this?

1216
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,875
- I'm not talking to Jerry. I'm talking to you.
- That's Jerry's job.

1217
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,679
That is actually... It's my department.

1218
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,919
You're absolutely right to ask, Cube. The
contracts are being finalized as we speak.

1219
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,232
The thing is, with these attorneys,
they'll take forever.

1220
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,438
Poring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But they're gonna get done.

1221
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,479
I wish I got paid by the hour
the way they do. You know?

1222
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,392
Me too.

1223
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,759
I just want to know what's goin' on, since
I did write a lot of lyrics on this record.

1224
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,073
Everybody knows
how important you are, Cube.

1225
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,391
They do?

1226
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,551
That's what's goin' on.

1227
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,677
We just need some time, that's all.

1228
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,157
Everything probably all right.

1229
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,959
I must be trippin'.

1230
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,996
Shit tastes pretty good.

1231
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,593
Someday, right?

1232
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,155
- Y'all enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

1233
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,512
I'm telling you, that guy wants to be you
very frickin' badly.

1234
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,751
As if I ain't got enough
fucking problems.

1235
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,599
Excuse me. Can I get a refill.

1236
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,275
At some point, you just gotta trust somebody.

1237
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,434
You know?

1238
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,312
You gotta trust somebody.

1239
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,717
Nah, I just think
you overreacting, man.

1240
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,872
Eazy one of us, Cube. What you
thinkin' don't even make sense.

1241
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,794
What don't make sense is Eazy and Jerry
eating steak and lobster...

1242
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,997
and we eating Fatburger.

1243
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,719
Shit don't make no sense.

1244
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:42,033
Look, I hear you, but I think
we need to ride this wave.

1245
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,719
For real.

1246
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,315
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.

1247
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,676
You know?

1248
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,912
It's my moms, man.

1249
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,033
Yo, Dre.

1250
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,998
What's going on?

1251
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,594
Um...

1252
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,752
Moms just called, man.

1253
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,079
It's Tyree.

1254
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,713
He's dead.

1255
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,759
- What?
- No.

1256
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,271
He got into a fight.
Some motherfucker broke his neck.

1257
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,317
It's my little brother, man.

1258
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,557
It's my little baby bro.

1259
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,271
I never told y'all this.

1260
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,159
But when I was 12,
my sister got killed.

1261
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,719
Her own husband killed her,
then killed himself.

1262
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,390
This dope gang took my cousin too.

1263
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,631
Shot him in the trunk of a car.

1264
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,397
Fuckin' Compton, man.

1265
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,432
Come on, man, like...

1266
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,591
It's my fault, man.

1267
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,115
- This never would've happened...
- Don't talk like that.

1268
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,112
if I had him out here, man.

1269
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,351
It's my fuckin' fault.

1270
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,159
It coulda happened in another way.

1271
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,357
You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.

1272
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,877
Tyree gonna always be with you.
No matter what.

1273
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,599
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1274
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,360
- Yeah, for real, man.
- And we always gon' be with you.

1275
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,193
- Hell yeah.
- That's for damn sure.

1276
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,794
We always gon' be brothers.

1277
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,190
Fuck!

1278
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,272
Shh.

1279
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,317
We here. All right?

1280
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,999
- I'm sorry, man.
- You good, Dre.

1281
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,231
We all here together.

1282
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,314
<i>This is not on you, Andre.</i>

1283
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,952
If I had just brought him
on tour with me, like he wanted.

1284
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,072
Stop this nonsense now. Stop it.

1285
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,516
Your brother looked up to you,

1286
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,193
and you took great care of him.

1287
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,511
We both did.

1288
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,957
It's time to let someone else
take care of him now.

1289
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,758
I'm proud of you.

1290
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,273
"No person shall disturb the

1297
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,158
Are we finished here?
We got a show to do.

1298
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,632
Just watch yourself.

1299
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,472
Eat a dick.

1300
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,437
It's "Fuck tha Police. "

1301
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,672
# Straight outta Compton is a brother
that'll smother your mother #

1302
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,160
# And make your sister
think I love her #

1303
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,596
# Dangerous muthafucka
raising hell #

1304
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,433
# And if I ever get caught
I make bail #

1305
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,512
# So what about the bitch
who got shot? #

1306
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,159
# Fuck her
You think I give a damn about a bitch? #

1307
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,435
# I ain't a sucker #

1308
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,115
# This is the autobiography
of the E #

1309
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,754
# And if you ever
fuck with me #

1310
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,912
# You'll get taken
by a stupid dope brother who will smother #

1311
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,276
# Word to the muthafucka
Straight outta Compton #

1312
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,431
# Compton, Compton, Compton ##

1313
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,112
Eazy! Eazy! Eazy! Eazy!

1314
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,672
Eazy! Eazy! Eazy! Eazy!

1315
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,473
Eazy! Eazy!

1316
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,314
Damn, that shit was dope!

1317
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,960
What's up?

1318
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,793
Let's do this shit.

1319
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,314
- What's up?
- Let's do this shit.

1320
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,960
- What's up? Let's go.
- What's up?

1321
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,554
Hey, hold on, hold on.

1322
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,316
Y'all know what the motherfuckin' police
tried to tell us backstage?

1323
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,232
What?

1324
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,552
They tried to tell us
what the fuck we can't play.

1325
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,233
Motherfuckers tryin' to tell us...

1326
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,391
what the fuck we can't say.

1327
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,672
This N.W.A!

1328
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,671
We do what the fuck we wanna do.

1329
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,559
We say what the fuck we wanna say!

1330
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,513
So everybody...

1331
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,274
put them middle fingers high in the sky.

1332
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,558
And to the punk-ass cop backstage...

1333
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,036
- Yo, Dre.
- What up?

1334
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,873
I got somethin' to say.

1335
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,756
# Fuck the police
Comin' straight from the underground #

1336
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,196
# A young nigga got it bad
'cause I'm brown #

1337
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,317
# And not the other color
so police think #

1338
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,552
# They have the authority
to kill a minority #

1339
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,120
# Fuck that shit
'cause I ain't the one #

1340
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,277
# For a punk muthafucka
with a badge and a gun #

1341
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,636
# To be beaten on
and thrown in jail #

1342
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,554
# We can go toe to toe
in the middle of a cell #

1343
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,314
# Fuckin' with me
'cause I'm a teenager #

1344
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,710
# With a little bit of gold
and a pager #

1345
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,837
# Searching my car,
looking for the product #

1346
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,560
# Thinking every nigga
is selling narcotics #

1347
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,916
# You'd rather see me
in the pen #

1348
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,276
# Than me and Lorenzo
rolling in a Benzo #

1349
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,317
# Beat a police out of shape #

1350
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,629
- # Then when I'm finished #
- What up?

1351
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,915
# Bring the yellow tape #

1352
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,515
# To tape off the scene
of the slaughter #

1353
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,069
# Still gettin' swoll
off bread and water #

1354
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,470
# I don't know
if they fags or what #

1355
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,313
# Search a nigga down
and grabbin' his nuts #

1356
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,518
# And on the other hand,
without a gun, they can't get none #

1357
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,956
# But don't let it be
a black and a white one #

1358
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,997
# 'Cause they'll slam ya down
to the street top #

1359
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,840
# Black police showin' out
for the white cop #

1360
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,320
# Ice Cube will swarm #

1361
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,313
# On any muthafucka
in a blue uniform #

1362
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,631
# Just 'cause
I'm from the CPT #

1363
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,360
# Punk police
are afraid of me, huh #

1364
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,954
# A young nigga
on the warpath #

1365
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,351
# And when I'm finished,
it's gonna be a bloodbath #

1366
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,274
# Of cops dyin' in LA #

1367
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,272
# Yo, Dre, I got
somethin' to say #

1368
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,635
# Fuck the police #

1369
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,871
# Fuck, fuck
Fuck the police #

1370
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,520
# Fuck the police #

1371
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,479
# Fuck, fuck
Fuck the police ##

1372
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,472
Fuck!

1373
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,631
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Run! Get in the bus!

1374
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,473
Hell! They shootin'! Let's go!

1375
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,715
Go, go! All units, move in!

1376
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,239
- Move! Move!
- Go, go, go, go!

1377
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,993
- Come on! Go!
- Let's move!

1378
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,914
Let's go, man!
Let's go! Let's go!

1379
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,152
- Come on, Yella! Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Let's go! Let's go!

1380
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,640
- Fuck this!
- Come on!

1381
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,719
- Shit! Fuck!
- Shit, shit, shit!

1382
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,759
- What we gonna do?
- Come on!

1383
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,878
Get off me!

1384
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,191
Backup! We need backup
in the loading area!

1385
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,595
Now!

1386
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,193
Come on! Get the fuck off me, man!

1387
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,954
- Fuck all y'all!
- You got a Taser?

1388
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,511
This is completely fucking illegal!
You realize that?

1389
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,512
- Let us go!
- Let me go!

1390
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,193
- Come on, man!
- Fuck you!

1391
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,953
- Come on!
- Eazy-E!

1392
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,520
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Get in there!

1393
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,557
- All right!
- Fuck you!

1394
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,036
Fuck the police! Fuck the police!

1395
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,555
Fuck the police! Fuck the police!

1396
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,270
Fuck your mama.
Fuck your daddy. Fuck your grandma!

1397
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,874
These motherfuckers.

1398
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,713
Fuck all this!

1399
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,440
No, fuck y'all! Fuck y'all!

1400
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,038
Fuck the police!

1401
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,232
How do you explain inciting a riot in Detroit?
What do you have to say about that?

1402
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,438
I have to say that, uh,
we didn't incite that shit.

1403
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,917
Right. Y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.

1404
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,310
We gave the people a voice.

1405
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,909
We gave the people truth.

1406
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,677
Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.

1407
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,639
Our art is a reflection of our reality.

1408
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,598
<i>What you see
when you go outside your door?</i>

1409
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,911
- I know what I see.
- And it ain't glamorous.

1410
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,596
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Colombia.

1411
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,957
- And ain't none of us got a passport, so...
- Yeah.

1412
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,839
- Might wanna check the source.
- Next question.

1413
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,833
Will you be more careful about
what you say, how you say it?

1414
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,434
- No.
- Probably not, no.

1415
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,116
Freedom of speech
includes rap music, right?

1416
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,830
Well, we exercising our First Amendment
as far as I'm concerned.

1417
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,116
And the government wrote that.

1418
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:38,717
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton do
when he starts making real money like this?

1419
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,353
Cube?

1420
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,396
Buy Raider gear.

1421
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,314
And curl activator.

1422
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,551
Next question.

1423
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,039
Good to see you, Cube.

1424
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,396
I can barely see you, Jerry.

1425
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,995
<i>What's with all the Godfather shit?</i>

1426
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,433
Okay.

1427
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,830
I know that you've been very eager...

1428
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,277
to sign a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.

1429
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,511
Eric's company?
Ain't it your company too?

1430
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,196
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.

1431
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,999
- You work for me?
- Uh-huh.

1432
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,271
I've made that clear from the beginning.

1433
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,273
All right, cool. So I could take this
to a lawyer or somebody, right?

1434
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,397
Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble.

1435
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,393
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.

1436
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,791
Jerry, you know I don't know what
none of this legal shit mean. All right?

1437
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,032
None of us do. We're gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything.

1438
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,396
Everybody else has already signed.

1439
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,633
I thought you knew this.

1440
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,110
You're the only one who hasn't.

1441
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,112
There's also this.

1442
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,472
$75,000.

1443
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,154
Shit.

1444
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,754
Sign the contract...

1445
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,957
and all this money is yours.

1446
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,993
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

1447
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,151
- Now, I wrote a lot of hit songs.
- Mm-hmm.

1448
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:26,154
We've been performing on this tour for
months... sellin' out shows, sellin' records.

1449
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,119
- I know it's plenty of money.
- Really?

1450
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,237
Jesus Christ.

1451
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,233
- Give me my money, Jerry.
- How the hell do you think this works?

1452
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,996
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

1453
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,754
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,

1454
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,038
security, the parties, all this shit.

1455
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,232
- How do you think it gets paid for? You think it's free?
- Why are you doing this now?

1456
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,115
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?

1457
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,438
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.

1458
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,309
Even a great talent can crash and burn.

1459
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,439
Too much ego, too much excess,

1460
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,352
too many expectations.

1461
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,679
It tends to ruin things.

1462
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,951
You ought to keep that in mind.

1463
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,996
This Eric's company, right?

1464
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,794
Bye, Jerry.
I'm out.

1465
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,391
What up, big Suge?

1466
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,358
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1467
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,999
Coming up.

1468
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,311
Hey, what up
with D.O.C. and Suge? Hmm?

1469
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,677
I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.

1470
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,073
One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,
and the next day you reppin' talent.

1471
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,753
Come on, man.

1472
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,912
- I guess everybody wanna get into the act, huh?
- I guess so.

1473
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,832
All right, man.

1474
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,672
I know, right?

1475
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,956
- How you doin'? You good?
- Here you go.

1476
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,236
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

1477
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,436
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1478
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,034
What's going on?

1479
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,955
You hungry? Yeah?

1480
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,111
I'll be there in a minute.
All right?

1481
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,714
Thanks, man.

1482
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,440
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet.

1483
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:44,116
So, Cube, we gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

1484
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,635
Nah, man. Not like this.

1485
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,235
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.

1486
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,198
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.

1487
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,398
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

1488
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,951
And I gotta put some money in my
mama's hand after Tyree passed, man.

1489
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,554
- I feel you.
- Right.

1490
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,075
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1491
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,311
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.

1492
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,551
Cube, we Ruthless.

1493
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,597
We N.W.A.

1494
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,399
They Ruthless.

1495
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,392
Cube, you comin'?

1496
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,877
I'm about to get out of here.

1497
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,879
- Take care of yourself, Dre.
- Peace.

1498
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,878
- Mom.
- I missed you.

1499
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,514
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1500
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,193
- Good.
- Come. Let's get home.

1501
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,714
All right.

1502
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,598
- So, you're leaving the group?
- Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1503
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,359
- So, you're leaving the group?
- Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1504
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,593
Eazy put everything on Jerry.
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

1505
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:56,115
It's a two-man show up there.
Ain't no fuckin' group.

1506
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,113
I get that, but I just
want you to understand...

1507
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,876
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

1508
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,794
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

1509
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,030
- A mistake?
- Yes.

1510
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,634
I don't think so, okay?

1511
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,757
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.

1512
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,799
Look, I want you
to express yourself, Cube,

1513
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,712
and I am your biggest fan.

1514
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,634
I believe in you,
but I just want you to understand...

1515
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,076
there's not a lot of money
in this solo play.

1516
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,554
Okay?

1517
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,279
But if the first record hits,

1518
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,636
I will make it up to you
on the second one.

1519
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,553
Be ready, Bryan.

1520
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,632
These records is comin' in fast.

# Just think if niggas

1527
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,319
# They try to keep me

1528
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,160
# And never tell you to get down
It's all about coming up #

1529
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,640
# So what they do?
Go and ban the AK #

1530
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,474
# My shit wasn't registered
any fuckin' way #

1531
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,870

1537
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,838

Our shit never been up there.
He blowin' the fuck up, Jerry.

It's gonna be fine. Eric.

We got D.O.C. We got
Michel'le. We got Above the Law.

We're moving up to the next level.

01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,513
You know what?
Sit down for two seconds.

1566
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,200
- Look, we need to keep Dre happy.
- Yeah.

1567
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,354
Look at him. You think he needs
any more motivation than that?

1568
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,711
I mean, I get it, Jerry.
He drownin' in pussy and shit.

1569

- You-You worry too much.

- Stop, okay?
- Yeah, all right.

1571

- Here, sign some checks.
- Right now, Jerry?

1572
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,314
- Yes, right now.
- Oh, come on!

1573
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,596
You're gonna be out of your mind later.
Do it now.

1574
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,798
The fact is, Ren is as good a writer
as Cube, maybe even better.

1575

They got everything covered.
Just the last one.

- Now, is that not what the fuck you said?
- That is what I said.

1597
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,192
But it is more complicated
than that, Cube.

1598
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,112
- All right? There are metrics...
- Come on, Bryan!

1599
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,669
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for...

1601
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,400
I mean, you gave me your word.

1602
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,631
- Cube, would you just calm down?
- Calm down?

1603
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,951
- I am just trying to give you what you want.
- You not.

1604
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,954
I been did the work. I gave you the
product. Give me my money, Bryan.

1605

he's supposed to get paid,

1606

for some shit that's technically mine.

Of course you are not begging.

1608
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,680
And I am not trying to be difficult, man.
I promise you.

1609
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,360
But you can't help me, right?

1610
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,397

He calls it political?
This is ignorant shit.

1787
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,473
I always knew it.
Now the whole world is gonna know.

1788
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,358
I'm gonna make sure of that. Okay?

1789
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,319
I don't understand why the fuck
you're not more angry about this.

1790
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,393
- Did you hear what he said?
- I heard what he said!

1791
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,994
About you? About me? Come on!

1792
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,879
You got your way of dealing with it.
I got mine.

1793
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,597
We could just go to the studio and just
end his fucking career anyway.

1794
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,751
I don't know about all that.

1795
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:17,275
Fine. You do that.
You call Dre, and you guys go do that.

1796
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,794
Do something.

1797
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,434

- Dre, maybe we should try to get back to work.

1818

We are working, Jerry.

1819
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,673

I had my people look at your contracts.

01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,036
It didn't look good.
But you gotta watch your back.

So, what's up?

1855
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:05,353
When you talked to me on the phone, man,
you sounded pretty worked up.

1856
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,231
Yeah, I know you don't like
hearing this shit.

1857
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,031
It's about Jerry, man.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.

1858
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,554
That's really why you came here?

1859
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:23,030
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

1860
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:29,233
This some real shit, man. And the shit
been happening since the beginning.

1861
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:32,870
I had some people look into this.
I ain't been gettin' my fair share.

1862
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,559
Do you even know
why you rich though?

1863
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,632
Do you know
why you got a big-ass house...

1864
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,712
and you ain't sleepin'
on your auntie couch no more?

1865
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,315
Because Jerry made that possible for us.

1866
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,438
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us.

1867
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,989
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

1868
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,754
Cube was right, fool.

1869
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,754
E, look at the papers, man, and you'll
see what the fuck I'm talkin' about.

1870
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,914
And forget about Jerry, man!
You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

1871
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,596
We didn't make it because of Jerry.
We made it because our shit is dope.

1872
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,677
And we can keep going, E.

1873
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,640
We can own the goddamn world, but we
just can't be fucking with him no more.

1874
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,514
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.

1875
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,599
I just want it to be right.

1876
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,195
And this what you think right?

1877
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,200
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

1878
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,034
You mean all he done for you.

1879
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,634
Right?

1880
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,600
Look at me.

1884
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,917

01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,079
Whatever, man.

1949
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,992
I'll be through there.

1950
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,676
<i>He had it in a power swing,
and he...</i>

1951
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,558
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

1952
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,199
<i>...right across the top
of the cheekbone,</i>

1953
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,590
<i>splitting his face
from the top of his ear to his chin.</i>

1954
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,553
Where Dre at?

1955
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,918
- You said he was gonna be here.
- I'll get with you outside.

1956
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,751
Don't worry about Dre.

1957
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,078
Truth be told,
he got nothin' to do with this.

1958
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,033
This what's gonna happen.

1959
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,113
You gonna sign these,

1960
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,715
releasing Dre and D.O.C. from Ruthless.

1961
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,960
Whatever, homey.

1962
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:06,473
You think I'm signing that,
you crazier than I thought you was.

1963
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,074
I'm out.

1964
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,310
Get your ass up.

1965
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,552
Nah. I think you're
gonna stay here for a while.

1966
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,836
Fuck you, Suge!

1967
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:21,752
Y'all niggas don't scare me.

1968
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,400
You can talk tough all you want,

1969
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,597
but this ain't no record.

1970
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,558
Don't make me change you, Eric.

1971
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,233
Fuck that's supposed to mean?

1972
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,676
Keep talkin'. You're gonna
fuck around and get smoked.

1973
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,753
Nah, nah. But you better choose right.

1974
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,071
You know where the fuck I'm from.

1975
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,436
This Bompton, nigga.

1976
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,356
Oh, my fucking God.

1977
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,797
Eric. Jesus Christ.

1978
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,518
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't sneak in here like that.

1979
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,599
I thought you were...

1980
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,669
Oh, my God. What's going on, man?
Are you okay?

1981
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,797
What happened to your face?

1982
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,554
I gotta kill this motherfucker
Suge Knight.

1983
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,553
I just came here to let you know,
'cause shit might get a little thick.

1984
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,836
I need to stay protected.

1985
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,112
No, you're not gonna do that. No.

1986
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,396
I didn't come here to ask for permission.

1987
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,234
I came here to let you know.

1988
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,950
You wanted to be involved with
this gangster shit? Here we go.

1989
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:56,512
You do that, and you're gonna ruin
everything we've worked for.

1990
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:02,279
You really think I got a fucking choice?
Look at my face!

1991
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,839
This the streets.
Motherfuckers came at me!

1992
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,151
Came at us!

1993
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,197
If I don't hit back, we finished.
It's over.

1994
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,078
I'm not saying that we're not
gonna hit back.

1995
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,117
But this is not Compton...

1996
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,953
if you haven't looked around.

1997
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,509
Drop that shit, okay?

1998
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,798
We don't hit back with bullets.
We hit back with lawyers.

1999
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,952
We drain these assholes.
That really takes 'em down.

2000
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,953
It ain't about the money, Jerry.

2001
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,112
- I don't care about no money.
- Of course it is.

2002
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,317
And you should fucking care
about the money.

2003
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:39,394
You're so much smarter
than these fucking thugs.

2004
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,871
You wanna kill somebody?
You're gonna go to jail forever.

2005
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,640
No more family, no more Ruthless,
no more anything.

2006
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,677
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over,

2007
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:53,320
and yours will just be beginning.

2008
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,392
Don't be a fucking fool.

2009
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,720
Hey.

2010
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,714
Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?

2011
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,437
'Cause it's better
than you being a dead man.

2012
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,195
I don't want you fucking dead.

2013
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,999
You okay?

2014
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,199
Let me see.

2015
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,714
- Why you so tense, Dre?
- No, I'm cool.

2016
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,796
Man. No, you're not, man. You've been
in that house, what? A month now?

2017
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,554
Nigga, and not one track?
I mean, what's up?

2018
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,637
There's too much interference.

2019
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,360
Man, you know how they
tryin' to starve me out.

2020
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,477
Playin' games
with my motherfuckin' money, man.

2021
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,120
That's why the house was
so goddamned empty.

2022
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,553
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm fucking with you, cuz. Hit this.

2023
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,553
- All right, man, give me that shit.
- Here it is.

2024
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,950
Fuck I'm taking about.

2025
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,430
How you feeling righteously together.

2026
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,473
- Holy shit.
- Oh, hell no.

2027
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:44,474
Goddamn, man!
What the fuck is in this shit, Snoops?

2028
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,076
- That right there, that's that Chronic, cuz.
- Yeah.

2029
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:51,152
- Chronic.
- Yes, sir.

2030
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,152
- Let me hit that once.
- Yeah.

2031
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,879
- Look it.
- Wow, man.

2032
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,440
Let me hit that once, man. Damn.

2033
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:59,797
- All right. Let's head back to the studio.
- Let's go.

2034
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,394
I got something for this.

2035
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,999
Damn, Dre. What the fuck is that?
Feelin' that shit.

2036
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,560
- Yeah, you feelin' it?
- Yeah!

2037
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,836
- Hey, hey, look, I'm gonna spit a little something.
- All right.

2038
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,151
You feel me? You say whatever...
You just jump in, nigga, and just...

2039
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,277
Hold on.
Look, I got something. Here we go.

2040
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:38,120
# One, two, three
and to the four #

2041
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,635
# Snoop Doggy Dogg
and Dr. Dre is at the door #

2042
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,837
# Ready to make an entrance,
so back on up #

2043
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,752
# 'Cause you know
we about to rip shit up #

2044
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,753
# Gimme the microphone first
so I could bust like a bubble #

2045
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,991
# Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you in trouble #

2046
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,152
- Uh-huh.
- # Ain't nuthin' but a "G" thang, baby #

2047
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,749
- # Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy #
- Uh-huh.

2048
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:58,435
# Death Row is the label
that pays me #

2049
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,910
- # Un-fadable, so please
don't try and fade this # - Ooh!

2050
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,152
# But back
to the lecture at hand ##

2051
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:06,596
I want to thank
you for having us here.

2052
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:09,115
- Of course.
- Very generous for you to give of your time...

2053
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:11,510
with, uh, everything
that's going on right now.

2054
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,114
Not a problem.

2055
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,759
Now, if I may...

2056
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,355
Are you anti-Semitic?

2057
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,955
Now, I thought this was about
the Rodney King trial.

2058
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,271
Well, the JDL recently got involved,

2059
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,034
citing the lyrics
about your former manager, Jerry Heller.

2060
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:27,713
I'm not anti-Semitic.

2061
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:30,793
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.
Let me ask you something.

2062
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,669
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

2063
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:38,117
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?

2064
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,800
- I have no idea.
- I didn't think you did.

2065
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:43,554
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

2066
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:48,920
Until then, I'm here to talk about the beating
of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King,

2067
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,469
and four guilty LAPD officers...

2068
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,394
who seem to be Daryl Gates's
standard issue.

2069
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,757
It's also the LAPD and the FBI...

2070
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,719
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

2071
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,759
"Fuck tha Police" is
just a warning, that's it.

2072
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,311
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

2073
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,551
I'm a journalist just like you...

2074
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:11,552
reporting what's goin' on
in the hood.

2075
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,678
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.

2076
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,231
And what's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

2077
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,193
They my brothers.

2078
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:24,272
You know what?
That question right there proves to me...

2079
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:27,194
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

2080
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,272
You talkin' to me like I'm some
elected official,

2081
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,352
like I'm running for office.

2082
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,272
But I get it. That's your job.

2083
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,875
Bigger the story, the bigger the check
in your field of work.

2084
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,872
It's not your fault.
I shouldn't blame you.

2085
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,156
- What's your name, man?
- Brian.

2086
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:44,199
Eat a dick, Brian. Get the fuck
out my house. Y'all done here.

2087
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,799
Can we cut, please?

2088
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,317

Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

2110
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:08,316
- You're not havin' a good time?
- No, no. No, I had a really good time.

2111
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,359
But now it's starting
to get a little wild.

2112
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,239
Yeah. We've been known
to get crazy from time to time.

2113
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:19,678
- I'm Andre.
- I'm Nicole.

2114
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:24,598
Come on, man. Lighten up.

2115
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:28,113
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.

2116
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,431
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2117
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,432
How do you figure?

2118
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:36,434
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.

2119
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,432
Did you forget about Ren's new album?

2120
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:42,434
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something

2121
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,513
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.

2122
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,478
All I know... Mm!

2123
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,680
Fucking Cube out here...

2124
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:54,719
- Doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2125
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,076
Then I keep hearing about this album
Dre about to drop.

2126
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:00,119
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.

2127
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,271
Producers don't rap.

2128
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:05,114
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.

2129
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,436
Cheer up.

2130
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,591
Eat, drink and be merry.

2131
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:10,796
- Suge.
- Hey.

2132
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,792
- How you doin'?
- All right.

2133
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,473
Jimmy Lovine, Interscope Records.

2134
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,358
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

2135
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:19,274
So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

2136
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:21,113
Nah, Dre is cool.

2137
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:23,192
- Go ahead. Have a seat.
- All right.

2138
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,509
- It's good.
- Yeah.

2139
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,877
- So, what do you got today?
- Um...

2140
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:29,314
Well, you know.

2141
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:32,871
I heard John McClain gave you my album.

2142
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:37,239
- What'd you think?
- I think it was great.

2143
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:41,030
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?

2144
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,676
- I did.
- Okay. And who mixed it?

2145
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,639
Hey, come on, man. I did.

2146
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,640
Huh.

2147
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,752
Listen. I don't know
anything about hip-hop,

2148
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:56,877
but I know that this is special.

2149
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,593
Seriously.

2150
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,554
Thank you.

2151
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:05,395
Look, we'd love to bring in Interscope,
but there's a little problem.

2152
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:08,075
- What's the problem?
- Ruthless.

2153
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:11,756
Lawsuits and contracts.

2154
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,752
Well, how about this?

2155
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,514
You give me three weeks,
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit...

2156
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:18,273
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

2157
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,750
If you do that,

2158
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:24,311
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.

2159
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,512

2160
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,673

2163
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,517

- It's cool.

Suge!

2166
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,316
- Suge, it's just a parking spot.
- Get off of me!

2167
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,039

2168
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:56,556

02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:26,190
- You what?
- I love you.

2275
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:28,397
You what?

2276
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,719
So how's your home life, man?

2277
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,037
What? That small-ass house I just
moved into in Norwalk?

2278
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:39,440
Fuckin' hate it.

2279
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,591
No, come on. You know what I mean.

2280
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:44,593
I mean your love life, Eric.
Hmm?

2281
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,917
You seem pretty serious
about this girl.

2282
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:52,190
- I ain't in love.
- Oh? You had me scared there for a minute.

2283
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:55,910
- You're too young to settle down.
- You don't have to be scared of that.

2284
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,356
Oh, man. Wait till you taste this.

2285
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:00,676
Kung pao chicken.

2286
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:04,436
Fantastic.
And it is better the second day.

2287
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:06,719
There you go.

2288
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:08,799
Dig in.

2289
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:14,398
So, where is this girl from, again?

2290
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:20,310
Look, Jerry.
I actually ate right before I came.

2291
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:23,040
So I'm just gonna take this and go.

2292
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:25,271
Hold on. Hold on.
Where are you going?

2293
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,758
I just came to get this.

2294
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,071
These are my bills, my checks.

2295
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:32,152
Look, I'm gonna have a bite
of your food.

2296
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:35,633
I'm gonna say farewell.

2297
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,792
I'll talk to you later.

2298
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,515
Your neighbors,
they've been complaining a lot.

2299
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:56,559
- About the noise.
- Stop.

2300
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:59,838
Man, I just think
a little privacy would be better.

2301
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:02,839
So what? You want me to move?

2302
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,595
Yeah.

2303
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:08,991
And I... You know,
I happen to know of a place.

2304
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,834
There's plenty of room,
and I know the owner.

2305
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,672
Are you sure
you're ready for that, Andre?

2306
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,991
Yeah, I am.

2307
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,834
'Cause I'm really feeling you like that.

2308
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,435
I'm really feeling you too.

2309
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:28,000
But...

2310
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:38,080
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It was just a thought.

2311
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:43,439
What's up?

2312
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,433
All right. Good night.

2313
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,955
Oh, whoa, whoa. Really?

2314
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:50,918
- Good night?
- You okay to drive?

2315
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:55,395
No. Look at you.

2316
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:59,076
- Good night, Andre.
- Nah. See...

2317
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:02,756
See, I can't help thinking maybe
you want me to come inside.

2318
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:06,993
- Of course I do.
- So, what's different now? Huh?

2319
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,834
I got a lot to think about.

2320
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:14,358
You're asking me to move in with you.
That is a huge step.

2321
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,912
I like you, Andre,
but there's a lot going on around you.

2322
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,639
What you mean?

2323
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:24,360
I know about the whole
Death Row business...

2324
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:27,274
the assault charges, the shooting.

2325
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,591
Just seems dangerous.

2326
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:32,514

Is good publicity.

2443
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:58,951
- You know it.
- You know that's right.

2444
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:02,630
Man. Look, man, I...

2445
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:05,872
I wish that dumb shit really would've
never popped off between us.

2446
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:08,077
We shouldn't have dissed each other
in the first place.

2447
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:11,392
Making the fans choose between us?
That wasn't cool.

2448
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:13,994
You right.

2449
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:19,152
- You ever think we'd be that big though?
- Hell no.

2450
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:22,517
I was just talking to my wife about that...
how it was in the beginning.

2451
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:25,519
- Yeah.
- Shit, we just wanted to do music for the neighborhood.

2452
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,512
Be ghetto stars.

2453
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:31,514
But what if we had
the chance to find out...

2454
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:33,080
how big we could really be?

2455
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:35,391
Come on, man, you got my mind workin'.

2456
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:37,995
I be thinking
about that shit all the time.

2457
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:41,113
If we could just take that shit back
to '89. We changed the world.

2458
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:44,034
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?

2459
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:46,874
It was hard then. But I've had days...

2460
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,873
where I almost wish
we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.

2461
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:51,519
Shit. You know?

2462
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:53,956
Shit ain't gotta stop there.

2463
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:57,954
But if we go do this,
we gotta do it right.

2464
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:00,760
And if Dre with it, I'm with it.

2465
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:03,958
But I don't know
your relationship with dude.

2466
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:07,477
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.

2467
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:14,953
All right.

2468
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:18,556
Hey, man.

2469
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,552
- Shit.
- It's 'cause you ain't got them damn gloves on.

2470
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:23,155
Man, whatever.

2471
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:24,879
But I hear you.

2472
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,514
Yeah?

2473
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:30,280
- You said it.
- All right.

2474
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:33,478
These invoices haven't been paid.

2475
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:35,631
They're two or three years outdated.

2476
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:38,673
These are canceled checks.
They all bounced.

2477
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:40,911
And these are past due.

2478
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,437
Jerry took advantage of you.

2479
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:49,157
I know it's a lot,
but you had to know the truth sometime.

2480
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,720
Now you do.

2481
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:56,356
You know, Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

2482
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:00,674
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.

2483
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,434
Don't. Don't.

2484
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:08,477
A really long time.

2485
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,876
Shit.

2486
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:33,677
Hey, man.

2487
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,712
Where you been?

2488
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:41,031
I've been calling you all day.

2489
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,557
Sit down, Jerry.

2490
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:51,154
What is this all about?
Uh, the groupie?

2491
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:53,709
The executive assistant?

2492
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,231
She even go to college?

2493
02:20:57,320 --> 02:21:00,358
Man, you're so much fucking
smarter than this.

2494
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:01,920
Sit down, Jerry.

2495
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:25,196
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.

2496
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:27,839
This about you.

2497
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,912
And you can stop acting like you
ain't never done nothin' wrong.

2498
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:32,430
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset.

2499
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,034
I understand.

2500
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,953
But I'm asking you...

2501
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,077
I'm advising you,
take a breath, okay?

2502
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:40,958
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.

2503
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:44,636
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.

2504
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:47,440
Here's what's about to happen.

2505
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:49,392
I'm-a get N.W.A back together,

2506
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,274
and you ain't gonna have
nothin' to do with it this time.

2507
02:21:54,400 --> 02:21:56,437
How the fuck can you even
say something like that?

2508
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:59,558
What the fuck
is going on with you, man?

2509
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:01,632
I know what's good for you.

2510
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:03,632
I know what's good for Ruthless.

2511
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:07,396
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work.

2512
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:09,312
And that trust is our foundation, Eric.

2513
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:12,393
I don't give a shit. Eric.

2514
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:18,198
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?

2515
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,474
Trust?

2516
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,836
Trust is a motherfucker.

2517
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,753
Is it?

2518
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:29,309
Let me ask you something.

2519
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,995
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,

2520
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:34,072
how come I've never
been sued, hmm?

2521
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:37,836
If I'm such a fucking thief,
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

2522
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:40,071
how come nobody's
ever come to collect?

2523
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:43,915
Because this is business,
and this is how it works.

2524
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,276
And it's not always pretty. No.

2525
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:50,195
Do I cover my own ass?
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

2526
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:54,274
But don't you dare fucking tell me
that I have not taken care of you.

2527
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:55,953
Don't you fucking tell me...

2528
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:58,874
that I have not
had your back from day one!

2529
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:00,679
Day one!

2530
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:07,680
Is this taking care of me?

2531
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:09,353
Are you fucking kidding me?

2532
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:11,193
It's taking care
of the whole fucking thing.

2533
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,273
It's business! And this is how it works.

2534
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,956
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

2535
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:22,557
But don't you dare fucking tell me
that I have not taken care of you.

2536
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,799
This business too?

2537
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:27,394
Yes. This is business.

2538
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:29,039
This is how fucked up it can get.

2539
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:32,232
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2540
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:33,754
You did!

2541
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:36,880
No.

2542
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,233
You did.

2543
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:43,320
You fired, Jerry.

2544
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:44,993
Oh, for Christ...

2545
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:46,878
Eric, this isn't how we do things.

2546
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:50,840
This is not you.
This is not you. Eric!

2547
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:53,879
This is an important company.

2548
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:56,759
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

2549
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:58,718
Eric?

2550
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,076
Oh, for Christ's sake! Eric!

2551
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:14,673
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

2552
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:16,433
Yeah, what up, Dre?

2553
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:18,352
<i>- Who this?
- Eric.</i>

2554
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:21,353
<i>- E?
- Just felt like calling.</i>

2555
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:24,353
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

2556
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:25,954
What's up?

2557
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:28,760
<i>I mean, you know me, man.
Doing my thing.</i>

2558
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:31,196
Killin' all this pussy.

2559
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,757
<i>- How about you?
- You know, man.</i>

2560
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:36,832
I'm just making tracks,
doing my thing.

2561
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:40,231
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did
was crazy. That was dope.

2562
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:45,076
Yeah? Thanks, E.
Good looking out, man.

2563
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,472
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,

2564
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:55,430
but, um, I talked to Cube,
and we were talking about some...

2565
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:57,273
some possibilities.

2566
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,076
Possibilities? Okay.

2567
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:05,074
Yeah, like, without Jerry Heller type
of fucking possibilities.

2568
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,470
Really? Well, it's about time.

2569
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,995
Man, I mean,
I know shit kinda went crazy.

2570
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:11,878
And...

2571
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:15,670
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,

2572
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:19,151
but... I really wish it didn't.

2573
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:25,672
It's, uh...

2574
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:29,595
To be honest, man, I'm not proud
of all the shit I did either.

2575
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,391
So, what you think, man?
You think we could get together, or what?

2576
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:39,914
What you think?

2577
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:45,113
Yeah, man.

2578
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:47,838
Yeah, that sound good.

2579
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:51,077
Let's do it, E. Let's do it.

2580
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:54,232
<i>I'm-a let you know when we can
get back into the studio, you know.</i>

2581
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:57,199
Lay down some tracks, like the old days.

2582
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:02,109
<i>- Fair enough.
- All right.</i>

2583
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:04,840
It's good to hear from you, man.

2584
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:08,440
All right.

2585
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:26,155
<i>Hip-hop]</i>

2586
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,596
<i>Man, y'all niggas ain't making no music in here.</i>

2587
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:43,751
- Hey!
- What's up, E?

2588
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,320
What's up? What up?
What up? What up?

2589
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:48,478
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube
gonna roll up in here, man?

2590
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:51,160
- I'm ready!
- Yeah, man. 'Cause I'm ready to get this new shit going.

2591
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:52,760
I'm ready too.

2592
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:55,992
But long as we stay ready,
we gonna know we gonna be on, man.

2593
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:58,800
Y'all already know

2594
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:01,475
- Here ya go, baby.
- E, I got books of new shit.

2595
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:04,359
- I got libraries of new shit.
- That's what I'm talking about, Ren.

2596
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,033
That's what I'm talking about.

2597
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:08,635
<i>I got the tracks. You like that?</i>

2598
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:12,316
Mm-hmm. Hell, yeah.

2599
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:14,631
You think you Dre now?

2600
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:16,592
I'm trying to murder Dre.

2601
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:19,792
I'm about to murder both of y'all
on the track though. Check me out.

2602
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:21,678
- Check me out.
- What you doing, E?

2603
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:23,911
You know you don't play no instruments.

2604
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:29,033
You gonna play it?

2605
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,993
E, you all right?

2606
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:35,394
Eric.

2607
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:38,199
Baby, you good?

2608
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:40,515
Yeah.

2609
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:43,832
- I'm all right.
- You sure?

2610
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:47,199
Eric! Eric!

2611
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:48,794
- Call 911.
- Eric!

2612
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:51,071
- Eric. Get up, man.
- Baby?

2613
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:52,992
Yo, call 911. Call 911.

2614
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:55,515
- You all right, E?
- Baby? Eric? Eric.

2615
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,831
- Eazy, wake up.
- Eric, baby!

2616
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:00,389
- Open your eyes.
- Yes, we need an ambulance.

2617
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:12,072
Um...

2618
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:19,236
Wait. Ain't you gonna
say something?

2619
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:22,392
What is it? A respiratory
infection? Pneumonia? What?

2620
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:26,520
Yes, well, um,
it is those things and more, I'm afraid.

2621
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:28,671
We ran a full blood battery.

2622
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:31,229
And, uh...

2623
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:35,792
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but, uh, you've tested positive for HIV.

2624
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:39,956
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Wha-Wha-What?

2625
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:44,034
A normal T-cell count
is anywhere between 500 and 1500.

2626
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:46,191
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.

2627
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:52,713
But I ain't no faggot.

2628
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,555
Mr. Wright, actually, um, the virus can be
transmitted in quite a few ways,

2629
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:59,712
including unprotected heterosexual sex.

2630
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:05,758
Uh... That's wrong.

2631
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:08,639
You-You gotta test that over.
That's... Test that again.

2632
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:11,474
We've run the test five times
with five different samples,

2633
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:13,233
- and the result remains the same.
- Shit!

2634
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:14,310
Tomica.

2635
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,000
Tomica.

2636
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:20,993
But she's pregnant, Doc.
What this mean?

2637
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:24,437
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus.

2638
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:27,240
But, uh, we have to test her to be sure.

2639
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:29,915
So, what do we do?
What... When we start the treatment?

2640
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,640
I mean, what... I gotta get healthy.

2641
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:36,157
I got things to do. I got...

2642
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,277
Wha-What are we supposed to do?

2643
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:39,919
Mr. Wright.

2644
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,072
You need to understand
that you are very, very sick.

2645
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,830
But I don't even feel that bad, Doc.
Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that.

2646
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:48,434
With care and palliative care,

2647
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:50,273
we can probably keep you comfortable...

2648
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:53,432
for, uh, maybe six months,
at the very most.

2649
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:57,036
Comfortable?
What do you mean, comfortable?

2650
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,319
It's just a matter of time.

2651
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:08,837
I am... I'm truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright.

2652
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:12,675
I'll-I'll leave you time to, um, process this.

2653
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,635
Come on, Doc. Come on, Doc. No.

2654
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:19,313
Doc.

2655
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:33,038
Come on!

02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:59,151
<i># But I don't gave a fuck
I'm gonna make my snaps #</i>

2775
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:02,199
<i># If not from the records, from
jackin' the crops Just like burglary #</i>

2776
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:06,070
<i>We make our records based on
stuff that's happening where we live.</i>

2777
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:10,393
And if people out there
that don't like it, fuck 'em.

2778
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:11,914
# Straight outta Compton #

2779
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,071
<i># Is a brother that'll
smother your mother #</i>

2780
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:18,200
Dre and Eazy had already been selling it
as cassette tapes. And they just blew up.

2781
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:20,875
Eazy and Dr. Dre Wild & Wet Pool Party.

2782
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:23,031
This is what it's all about!

2783
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:25,032
"We wanted to invite you
to the president's luncheon. "

2784
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:27,112
I said, if I go down there,
this'll start some shit.

2785
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:29,874
<i># To me it's kinda funny
The attitude showin' a nigga drivin' #</i>

2786
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:33,078
<i>When I think of N. W.A,
they weren't really music to me.</i>

2787
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:34,958
<i>It was more like a real lifestyle.</i>

2788
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,793
<i>Brothers from my neighborhood made it out.</i>

2789
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:39,111
<i># Niggas start
to mumble They wanna rumble #</i>

2790
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:41,795
<i># Mix 'em and cook 'em
in a pot like gumbo #</i>

2791
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:44,111
- You got the dopest album out this year.
- Thanks, man.

2792
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:46,556
<i>More than happy to get my career going
like I want it to go.</i>

2793
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:48,233
Damn!

2794
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:50,880
<i># Ain't no tellin'
when I'm down for a jack move #</i>

2795
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:52,952
<i># AK-47 is the tool #</i>

2796
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:55,316
You do not know how long I waited
to get in his booth...

2797
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:57,869
and to have Dre out there
goin', "You ready?"

2798
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,276
<i>I waited all my life for that,
since Straight Outta Compton.</i>

2799
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:04,912
Dre's direction was helping me become
a strong lyricist, which I am now.

2800
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,640
<i># That I'm down
with the capital CPT#</i>

2801
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:09,558
<i># Boy, you can't fuck with me #</i>

2802
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:12,519
<i>Dre has taught me a lot.
Not just rap-wise,</i>

2803
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:14,393
<i>but business-wise,
you know what I'm sayin'?</i>

2804
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:17,314
You'd have to even credit
both Eminem's and my success to Dr. Dre.

2805
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:23,557
<i>Apple's purchase of Beats
will be the biggest deal in its history.</i>

2806
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:25,233
<i>Our music was like our weapon.</i>

2807
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:28,080
<i>We let people know
that it's okay to say what you wanna say.</i>

2808
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:30,311
<i># As I leave,
believe I'm stompin' #</i>

2809
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:33,438
<i># But when I come back, boy,
I'm comin' straight outta #</i>

2810
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,591
<i># Straight outta
Straight outta #</i>

2811
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:37,751
<i># Straight outta
I'm comin' straight outta Compton #</i>

2812
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:39,718
<i>- # Compton, Compton, Compton ##
- Ow!</i>

2813
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:51,430
<i>Damn, that shit was dope!</i>

2814
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:07,634
<i># I just need y'all
to bear with me for a minute #</i>

2815
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:10,872
<i># While I talk
about the pages of my diary #</i>

2816
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:13,634
<i># Yeah
Listen up #</i>

2817
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:16,633
<i># Uhh, I remember
when I got started #</i>

2818
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,200
<i># My intention was to win #</i>

2819
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:20,078
<i># But a lot of shit changed
since then #</i>

2820
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:23,551
<i># Some more friends became enemies
in the quest of victory #</i>

2821
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:26,394
<i># But I made a vow
Never let this shit get to me #</i>

2822
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:29,996
<i># I let it pass, so I consider
that part of my history #</i>

2823
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,914
<i># And I'm strong
financially, physically #</i>

2824
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,674
<i># Mentally I'm
on a whole another level #</i>

2825
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:38,320
<i># And don't forget
that I came from the ghetto #</i>

2826
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:40,915
<i># Sold a new house for my moms
That's special #</i>

2827
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,720
<i># I let you going shopping
till your feet get tired #</i>

2828
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:47,077
<i># Then a new Benz
just for you to ride in #</i>

2829
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,880
<i>- # When I didn't have it, you provided #
- # You provided #</i>

2830
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:52,520
<i># Don't be surprised
that I built an enterprise #</i>

2831
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:56,514
<i># And my house got a view
of the city like a high-rise #</i>

2832
02:42:56,600 --> 02:43:01,117
<i># I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

2833
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:03,874
<i># When I open up my book
I think about the world later #</i>

2834
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,879
<i># No ink in the pen
No lines on the paper #</i>

2835
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:12,513
<i># I'm just, I'm just
I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

2836
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:15,240
<i># Sometimes when I got
a lot of shit on my mind #</i>

2837
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:18,233
<i># I'm just starin' at the sky
You probably thinkin' I'm high #</i>

2838
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:23,952
<i># I'm just, I'm just
I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

2839
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:27,192
<i># Now puff, puff, pass that
A nigga having flashbacks #</i>

2840
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:29,476
<i># I remember
how it used to be #</i>

2841
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:32,758
<i># Now my money like NASDAQ
My checks you can cash that #</i>

2842
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:34,797
<i># I remember
how it used to be #</i>

2843
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:36,872
<i># I used to be
a starving artist #</i>

2844
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:38,758
<i># So I would never
starve an artist #</i>

2845
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:41,560
<i># This is my passion
It's where my heart is #</i>

2846
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:44,553
<i># It gets the hardest
when I think about the dearly departed #</i>

2847
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:46,313
<i># Like the nigga
I started with #</i>

2848
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:49,791
<i># I know Eazy can see me now
looking down through the clouds #</i>

2849
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:52,560
<i># And regardless,
I know my nigga still proud #</i>

2850
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:55,314
<i># It's been a while since we spoke
but you still my folks #</i>

2851
02:43:55,400 --> 02:43:57,551
<i># We used to sit back,
laugh and joke #</i>

2852
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:00,320
<i># Now, I remember when we
used to do all-nighters #</i>

2853
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:03,393
<i># You in the booth and Cube
in the corner writing #</i>

2854
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:06,115
<i># Where Ren at?
Shout out to my nigga Yella #</i>

2855
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:07,793
<i># Damn, I miss that #</i>

2856
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:10,440
<i># Shit, a nigga
having flashbacks #</i>

2857
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:12,751
<i># When I open up my book
I think about the world later #</i>

2858
