1
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,208
- Hi there.
- Hello.

2
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,093
Espresso.

3
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,456
We've just got
the regular type of coffee here.

4
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,131
Uh, two, please.

5
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,581
Ugh.

6
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,587
Okay.

7
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,630
Bonjour.

8
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,998
<i>You have completed
lesson 25. Well done.</i>

9
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,592
<i>At this point, you should have
a firm grasp of the French language.</i>

10
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,843
<i>Let's continue.</i>

11
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,929
I wish I would have
been able to see that.

12
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,320
Grant is
without a doubt

13
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,697
the worst boss
on the face of the Earth.

14
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,080
One of these days, I'm going to
punch him in the goddamn throat.

15
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,581
I can promise you that.

16
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,087
- Are you talking about Grant?
- We are.

17
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,837
I was thinking we should pull
an office prank on Grant, you know.

18
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,717
Put, like, an air horn
under his chair,

19
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,838
so when he sits down,
it makes a really loud noise.

20
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,090
Or set fire to his house.
Something along those lines.

21
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,842
I think Maggie
gave birth recently.

22
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,644
Grant's wife, Maggie.
Actually, I... I know she did.

23
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,837
I went to the cookout
at his house last weekend

24
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,901
and they were there with their new baby,
along with their two other children.

25
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:04,242
It was actually a really nice cookout.
Quality meats and sides.

26
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,795
There was even a raffle for a gift card
to that new restaurant in town.

27
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,332
Most of the office was there.
Some of them even wore their swimsuits.

28
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:17,835
So, maybe burning down
the house isn't the best...

29
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,678
But, yeah...
Yeah, sometimes...

30
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,388
Sometimes here at the office,
Grant will give me an assignment,

31
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,143
such as auditing an expense report,
and even though it's part of my job,

32
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,637
reports and auditing,
it can be frustrating.

33
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,342
What's that magazine
you're reading?

34
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,229
- What department are you in?
- Accounting.

35
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,444
So you're the one who audits
our expense reports?

36
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,116
Yeah.

37
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,111
Get the fuck
out of here.

38
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,822
I'm sorry.
I didn't know we were out.

39
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,305
Do you have a gun?

40
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,352
What?

41
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,236
No, no, no, no.
Please don't.

42
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,107
Oh, here, here.
You can take my wallet.

43
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,903
There's $10 plus a gift card
to the new restaurant in town.

44
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,626
Why are you doing this?

45
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,811
<i>There was yet
another mugging last night,</i>

46
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,227
<i>this one putting
a 35-year old dog owner</i>

47
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,565
<i>in critical condition.</i>

48
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,230
<i>The motorcycle-riding
assailants are still at large.</i>

49
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,274
Daddy,
there's a doggy in here.

50
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,197
<i>In an official statement,
police are urging residents</i>

51
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,237
<i>to stay indoors after dark,</i>

52
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,578
<i>adding that if you must go outside,
you should carry a weapon,</i>

53
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,823
<i>such as a gun
or a large knife.</i>

54
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,080
<i>You have
only one unheard message.</i>

55
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,919
<i>Hey, Casey. Uh, this is Grant.
Your boss. From work.</i>

56
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,583
<i>Just calling to check in on you,
see how you're doing.</i>

57
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,864
<i>I just want you to know,
you can take all the time you need.</i>

58
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,925
<i>We can keep you on paid leave
for another week</i>

59
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,705
<i>and then it'll just start counting
towards your vacation time.</i>

60
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,223
<i>Uh, but you've got so much of that
built up, so I wouldn't be concerned.</i>

61
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,102
<i>Hey, um, maybe you could take that trip
to France you're always talking about.</i>

62
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,046
<i>I hear the people there are lovely
and the food is supposed to be...</i>

63
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,146
<i>No one else
left you a message.</i>

64
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,719
I'm sorry.
I can't go out there.

65
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,100
<i>This isn't how it was
supposed to be.</i>

66
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,955
<i>I was supposed to win.
You didn't play by the rules.</i>

67
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,869
<i>There never were any rules.</i>

68
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:40,947
Can I help you?

69
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,442
- I'm interested in buying a gun.
- Are you a hunter?

70
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,952
No. It would be
for self-defense.

71
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,635
I need something
that can fit into my hand.

72
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,324
Sounds like
you're after a handgun.

73
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,624
How about
something like this?

74
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,347
Yes. This is exactly
what I'm looking for.

75
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,334
I can hold it in my hand
quite easily.

76
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,650
I'll run the background check
and file the necessary paperwork.

77
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,483
Yeah. Is there some sort of
box you can put this in, or a bag?

78
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,991
Sorry. There's a waiting period before
you can legally purchase this gun.

79
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,994
- Oh.
- It's so a person who is upset with another person

80
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,413
can't come in here and buy a gun
to shoot that person with.

81
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,895
Instead, they have to wait a little
while before they can do that.

82
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,416
- Do you have any children?
- No, I don't. Just a dog.

83
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,630
Good. If you did
have children,

84
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,763
I would warn you that the risk of
accidental death increases drastically

85
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,660
with a gun in the home,
but since you don't have any children,

86
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,346
that statistic
is irrelevant to you.

87
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,687
You did mention self-defense though.
Be cautious.

88
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,851
In a violent altercation, an armed victim is
much more likely to be shot and killed

89
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,021
than an unarmed victim.

90
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,904
Suicide is more common
with gun owners too.

91
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,615
You're really gonna
love owning a gun.

92
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,153
I'm sure you're right.

93
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,250
Karate is a language.

94
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,504
It's a way of communicating.

95
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,083
When you were a child,

96
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,878
you trained your vocal chords
to manipulate air to make words.

97
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,220
And then you learned
how to combine those words together

98
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,933
so that they would
form sentences.

99
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,888
And those sentences expressed thoughts,
wants, needs...

100
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,977
Every conversation that you had
was honing your skills.

101
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,320
And now,
after all these years,

102
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,321
you are black belts
in speech.

103
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,291
So, at this point
in your karate training,

104
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:44,169
you are learning how to form words
with your fists and with your feet.

105
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,263
You're gonna get to the point
where you don't even have to think about it.

106
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,346
Ask me a question.

107
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,612
What... What are your
plans for the weekend?

108
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,772
I'm going to do some grocery shopping
and rent a film.

109
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,359
Perhaps a comedy to watch

110
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,030
in the comfort of my own

111
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,778
home.

112
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,417
Did that
answer your question?

113
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,842
That's it for today.
Bow to me.

114
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,722
Bow to Grand Master.

115
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,434
I hope it's...

116
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,821
I hope it's all right
that I watched.

117
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,617
The hardest part of your karate journey is
walking through that door

118
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,782
for the first time.
That's where most people fail.

119
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,037
- What was your name?
- Casey. Casey.

120
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,086
My name is Sensei.

121
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,293
Can anyone take classes?

122
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,378
The first lesson is free, so why don't you
come in tomorrow and give it a shot?

123
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,182
I'll try.

124
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,526
Higher, Manny.
You must attain the proper angle.

125
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,229
Remember, you're punching
his nose up into his brain.

126
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,064
The key word is "up."

127
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,609
Okay, class, line up.

128
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,905
We're gonna work
on a rear naked strangle.

129
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,205
With karate, our goal is always
to end a fight with strikes.

130
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,973
Snapping an opponent's arm with a karate chop,
that would be one way.

131
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,377
Or shattering their jaw
with a perfectly placed

132
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,823
spinning wheel kick
would be another.

133
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,044
But realistically,
when engaged in combat,

134
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,763
it is not a matter of if a fight
will end up on the ground.

135
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,473
It's a matter of when.

136
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,845
Manny.

137
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,678
This is called
"taking the back."

138
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,558
I am in
the dominant position.

139
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,523
He is a mouse.
I am a python.

140
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,857
I slide my arm around his neck,
my elbow under his chin.

141
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:20,572
Like a python, I slowly begin to
squeeze my mouse.

142
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,750
My arm cuts off the carotid arteries
on either side of his neck,

143
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,042
starving the brain of oxygenated blood.

144
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,297
Students, what is
rule number eight?

145
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,258
Tap or take a nap.

146
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,928
Tap or take a nap.

147
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,685
Okay, let's give
this technique a try.

148
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,814
Bow to me.

149
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,032
Bow to Grand Master.

150
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,538
Hi there.

151
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,500
You're an excellent teacher.

152
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,697
Usually, it's the mothers
that bring the children, not the fathers.

153
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,757
Which one's yours?

154
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,593
Oh, I'm not a parent.

155
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,217
I'm actually a new student.
I'm taking my first class today.

156
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,810
- You're a new white belt?
- Is that the first belt color?

157
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,393
White is before color.
You haven't earned color yet.

158
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,766
That makes sense, actually.

159
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,692
I think I need to borrow
a uniform for class.

160
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,311
I was going to ask Sensei
but I didn't see him...

161
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,984
And you're lucky
he doesn't see you.

162
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,275
You're lucky he doesn't
see some white belt

163
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,819
disrespecting his dojo
and everything he's built.

164
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,490
What is the first rule?

165
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,822
The board is behind you.
What's rule number one?

166
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,914
Oh.

167
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,916
No shoes on the mat.

168
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,174
Take off your
fucking shoes, white belt.

169
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,737
You need a gi and you need a belt.
Is that what you're asking?

170
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,196
Yes.

171
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,053
- But say I'm at an ATM...
- Mmm.

172
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,411
...and as my back is turned,
a man grabs my throat from behind.

173
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,947
- Okay. May I?
- Of course.

174
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,208
In this instance,

175
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,666
the first thing you always have to do
is alleviate the pressure on your neck.

176
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,921
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,584
Your center of gravity
needs to be lower than mine,

178
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,835
so drop your hips.

179
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,757
- Like this?
- Exactly.

180
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,968
Now you can lift me
off my feet with ease.

181
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,637
Good.

182
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,146
See, even though I have your back,
you are now in the dominant position.

183
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,807
I have no control
and I can easily be thrown.

184
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,479
- This is very effective.
- Yes, it is.

185
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,607
- What if they're resisting more?
- Show me.

186
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,373
I see what you mean.
I would probably, uh...

187
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,246
I'd probably do
something like that.

188
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,130
There's a lot of testosterone
in this dojo.

189
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,682
That's a hormone
men produce.

190
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,225
Women produce it too
but men produce much more.

191
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,232
Is this your first class?

192
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,359
- It is.
- Here, let me help with that.

193
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,278
You gotta start from the front,
not the back.

194
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,708
Mmm.

195
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,305
I notice
that your belt is blue.

196
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,893
It is. Um, I feel a connection
to the color blue.

197
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,435
- It suits me.
- Is blue a high rank?

198
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,015
Blue is one of
the middle colors.

199
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,361
The order is white, yellow, green,
blue, purple, brown, black.

200
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,900
Some schools use different colors
or change the order of the colors,

201
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,244
but our academy does it this way
and it's definitely the best way.

202
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,956
- And what do the strips of tape mean?
- They're called "stripes."

203
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,039
Stripes.

204
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,251
Stripes signify advancements
and achievements.

205
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,459
What does
the red stripe mean?

206
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,298
It means the person has killed
another person in combat.

207
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,007
I'm joking.
It's for instructors.

208
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,926
Anna, the brown belt,
has a red stripe

209
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,515
and she teaches
the children's class.

210
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,348
The only two people here
with red stripes are her and Sensei.

211
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,770
And what about
the black stripe?

212
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,349
Sensei only gives those to select students.
Green belt and up.

213
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,926
Today's your first day though.
I wouldn't worry about stripes.

214
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:14,206
It is wise to respect the past
but foolish to ignore innovation.

215
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,162
Grand Master understood this.

216
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,959
He would say,

217
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,497
"The only moves worth learning
are the ones that work."

218
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,293
Just 'cause I'm a karateka
doesn't mean that I wouldn't teach

219
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,177
a bow and arrow choke
from Brazilian jiujitsu,

220
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,968
or an inside heel hook
from Russian sambo.

221
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,052
I would teach a reverse wrist splicer
from Mongolian judo if it worked

222
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,769
and if it wasn't something
I just made up.

223
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,722
Rule number 10.

224
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,318
If it works, use it.

225
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,572
Which brings me
to today's lesson.

226
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,034
To kick with your fists,

227
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,824
and punch with your feet.

228
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,866
- I'm Kennith. What's your name?
- Casey.

229
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,078
I'm glad
you chose karate, Casey.

230
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,336
It's an excellent martial art
and will likely change your life.

231
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,593
- Would you like to go first?
- Maybe you should go first.

232
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,761
Okay.

233
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,597
- Not in the day class.
- Sorry, Sensei.

234
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,416
I forgot where I was.
It was an accident.

235
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,687
You all right?

236
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,989
I'm really glad
you're here.

237
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,449
That punch
got away from me.

238
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,244
I apologize.
Would you like to try?

239
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,426
Okay, uh, that was
a good first try.

240
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,963
That felt a little more like
a kick than a punch though.

241
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,760
It felt like
a kick to me too.

242
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,093
Your whole life, you've known
that a foot can only kick.

243
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,011
You've known
that a foot cannot punch.

244
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,638
Forget everything
that you know.

245
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,402
Much better.
That felt like a punch.

246
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,908
A very weak punch,

247
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,951
but the most important thing is that
you're learning to punch with your foot.

248
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,825
Let me show you again.

249
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,666
Don't think of it as me punching
your body with my foot.

250
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,584
Think of it as you striking
my foot with your body.

251
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,090
That makes perfect sense.

252
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,310
Wow.

253
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,929
You have a wonderful
sense of balance.

254
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,557
I wanna sign up
for classes.

255
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,022
That's excellent news.

256
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,245
I'm gonna go ahead
and enter you into the system.

257
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,758
- Name? Casey...
- Davies.

258
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,174
That's a very
feminine-sounding name.

259
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,434
- Age?
- I turn 36 next month.

260
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
Do you know what that is in months?
The system does it in months.

261
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,662
Four hundred
and thirty-two minus one

262
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,619
is 431 months old.

263
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,584
Oh.

264
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,628
That sounds old
when you put it that way.

265
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,883
Why karate?

266
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,677
Um...

267
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,220
This question is
multiple-choice.

268
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,345
"A, health and fitness.
B, career opportunity.

269
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,816
"C, New Year's resolution.
D, self-defense/traumatic experience."

270
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,485
What if
it's none of the above?

271
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,198
- Should I read the choices again?
- No, that's okay.

272
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,900
A, health and fitness.

273
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,761
This is the equipment room.

274
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,098
- This room is off limits. You understand?
- Okay.

275
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,596
Wait here, please.

276
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,502
This is your belt.

277
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,963
Do not come to class without your belt.
It is yours. It is sacred.

278
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,095
There'll be a $15 charge
to replace a lost belt.

279
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,155
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

280
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,199
<i>May I speak to
Ms. Casey Davies, please?</i>

281
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,037
This is him.
I'm a man.

282
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,449
<i>My mistake. I thought it was
a woman's name.</i>

283
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,704
- Who is this?
<i>- I'm calling about yourgun, the handgun.</i>

284
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:57,048
<i>Wait. I remember you now.
Yes, you are a man. Again, apologies.</i>

285
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,211
That's all right.

286
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,549
<i>It looks like your paperwork is gonna
go through without any complications.</i>

287
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,922
<i>Tomorrow morning, you will be able
to come in and purchase your gun.</i>

288
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,893
<i>- Are you still there?</i>
- I don't need a gun anymore.

289
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,887
<i>You're not having a child,
are you?</i>

290
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,852
<i>Because we sell child safety locks
that work reasonably well.</i>

291
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,312
No. No child. I just...

292
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,020
I found something else.

293
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,444
<i>Don't tell me you bought a knife.
Knives are good for self-defense too,</i>

294
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,533
<i>but nine times out of 10,
a person with a knife</i>

295
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,243
<i>who gets into a fight with a person
with a gun will lose.</i>

296
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,282
I didn't buy a knife.

297
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,327
<i>Well, the paperwork is valid
for the next six months.</i>

298
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,288
<i>In the meantime, I hope you don't
get attacked by anyone with a gun,</i>

299
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,411
<i>- or even a knife.</i>
- Goodbye.

300
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,491
<i>Good luck...</i>

301
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,305
Next. Go.

302
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,899
Next. Go.

303
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,153
Go.

304
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,528
Horrible.

305
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,744
You do that in a fight
and your opponent would laugh at you.

306
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,291
Next. Casey.

307
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,585
Good.

308
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,008
Very good.

309
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:11,433
<i>Hey, Casey. Uh, it's Grant,
your boss. From... From work.</i>

310
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,848
<i>So, it's been two months
since you've been in to the office.</i>

311
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,475
<i>How are you?</i>

312
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,643
<i>I've extended your leave five weeks past
what I'd originally planned,</i>

313
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:25,155
<i>and your paycheck last week, you know,
that actually came out of my own pocket,</i>

314
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,066
<i>but I consider you a friend.
Uh</i>...

315
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:31,907
<i>Look, I hate to be the bad guy here
but I'm going to need you to come in.</i>

316
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,744
<i>I can give you another day but you have
to come back to work after that.</i>

317
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,284
<i>Or</i>... <i>You know,
I'm going to have to let you go,</i>

318
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,704
<i>and I really don't want
to have to do that.</i>

319
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,375
<i>Look, if it were up to me, I'd give you
all the time you need, but my bosses...</i>

320
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,962
<i>The inbox is full.
Please clear your messages.</i>

321
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,852
Who are all
these new people?

322
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,068
Today's the promotion
ceremony.

323
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,903
Everyone comes
to the promotion ceremony.

324
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,700
- Even students who take the night class.
- The night class?

325
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,743
Black stripes.

326
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:17,039
The color black represents
night. As in "night class."

327
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,371
I think I'll stick
with the day class.

328
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,672
Now that I think about it,
you're much more suited to the day class.

329
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,841
Me, on the other hand...

330
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,761
I'm getting
my stripe today.

331
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,930
Overheard Sensei
talking about it.

332
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,009
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

333
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,224
I have...
I have definitely earned it.

334
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,992
Today's a special day.

335
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,418
Not only is it a day
in which we recognize those of you

336
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,878
who have outgrown
your belt color,

337
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,419
it is also
an important anniversary.

338
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,092
Seven years ago today,

339
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,929
Grand Master was killed
in a tragic hiking accident

340
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,672
where he was shot
in the face with a gun.

341
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:20,311
He was mistaken for a bird
by a hunter carrying a shotgun.

342
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,848
Type of gun
that fires a cartridge

343
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,726
which scatters 10 to 20 pellets
at its target.

344
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,270
Unlike our karate,
which is clean and precise,

345
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,523
this gun was imprecise
and boorish.

346
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,820
Rule number 11.

347
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,653
Guns are for the weak.

348
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,530
That board isn't
just for children.

349
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,658
The rules apply
to all of us.

350
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:03,179
Grand Master is the only person ever
to wear the rainbow belt.

351
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,814
It's a belt color that he created
and awarded to himself.

352
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,155
It is the highest honor
in all of karate.

353
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,196
He achieved this rank
after he challenged and defeated

354
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,492
all three other grand masters in the state
in unarmed combat to the death.

355
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,709
He finished each fight
with his signature technique.

356
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,870
A technique
only he knew.

357
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,876
A technique he never
even taught me.

358
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,254
He punched through his opponents' heads
with his index finger.

359
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,475
He was the greatest man
who ever lived.

360
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,107
I do not award belts.

361
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,894
My students earn them.

362
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,649
And this first belt
goes to someone

363
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,321
who I see
a little of myself in.

364
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,613
He has devoted
himself to karate,

365
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,534
and he has more than earned the right
to wear the color yellow.

366
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,130
Casey.

367
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,045
The progression from
yellow belt to green belt

368
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,389
is one of great sacrifice
and introspection.

369
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,595
It is filled with immeasurable pain,
both internal and external.

370
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,494
Thank you all for coming
to support each other.

371
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,497
- We are all family here...
- Isn't there something else?

372
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:28,787
What was that?

373
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,749
I just wanted to make sure you weren't
forgetting something.

374
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,362
What would I
be forgetting, blue belt?

375
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,884
Uh, I heard there was going to be
another promotion tonight.

376
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,713
- You heard that?
- I did.

377
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,675
Something black.

378
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,811
Oh.

379
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,931
"Something black."

380
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,270
Actually, you're correct.

381
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,236
There is something black.

382
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,823
Well, I was saving it till the very end
for dramatic effect.

383
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,515
As I said before,
today is a special day.

384
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,104
Not only because it is
the unfortunate anniversary

385
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,477
of Grand Master being shot
and killed while on a hike

386
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,646
after being mistaken
for a bird by a hunter.

387
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,815
Today is the first time

388
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,776
that I get to promote one of
my students to black belt.

389
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,079
This student has been with us
from the very beginning.

390
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,165
They are unquestioning.

391
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,867
Their loyalty is unwavering.

392
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,168
But most importantly, they know
that despite this black belt,

393
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,925
they will always
be my student,

394
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,011
while I will always
be their teacher.

395
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,894
Thomas.

396
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,907
You're in my spot,
brown belt.

397
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,919
Black is higher than brown.
Please move over to your left.

398
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,577
This concludes
the ceremony.

399
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,684
As always, be sure to hold on
to your old belts

400
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,345
so that if someone questions
the legitimacy of your rank,

401
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,684
you can prove them wrong first
with tangible evidence,

402
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,023
and then in combat.

403
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,832
- Missionary.
- Ah, that is the best position.

404
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,661
I also like when I'm behind her
and she's on her hands and knees...

405
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,003
- Doggy style.
- Yes, doggy style.

406
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,838
That position
is also very nice.

407
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,950
All this stuff's yellow.

408
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,419
Paper, please.

409
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,849
Excuse me
Did you door-ding my car?

410
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,223
- I don't know.
- I think you did.

411
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,599
Then why
did you ask me?

412
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,105
Because I wanted to give you the
benefit of the doubt.

413
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,569
- Okay, then no.
- No what?

414
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,605
- I don't think I did.
- But you did though.

415
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,150
- I say I didn't.
- But it doesn't work that way.

416
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,823
You obviously did. I saw you.
You can't just tell me...

417
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,786
- Do you have a problem?
- The part where you slammed your door

418
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,549
into my car, I have a problem
with that. Yes.

419
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,002
- I know karate.
- What belt are you?

420
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,580
Yellow belt.

421
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,877
Your arms are holding
the grocery bag.

422
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,588
You'd have to drop the bag
in order to strike me.

423
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,156
In the time it would
take you to do that,

424
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,020
I would punch you
in the face as hard as I can.

425
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,098
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Do you have a problem?

426
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,607
You didn't slam
your door into my car,

427
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,646
- so I don't have a problem.
- No.

428
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,075
You? Karate?
Impossible.

429
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,303
No. Bad dog.

430
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,524
I'm sorry.

431
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,083
Fuck.

432
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,343
Are you sure this board
isn't meant for green belts?

433
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,088
Here, let me try.

434
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,090
Okay.

435
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,100
Here, try a white
belt board.

436
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,035
Your kicks and punches
lacked conviction today.

437
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,746
Maybe I was wrong.

438
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,271
Maybe you weren't ready
to be a yellow belt.

439
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:48,431
No. You're not supposed to do that.
You're supposed to stand up for yourself.

440
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,233
But you're right though. I wasn't able
to break a single board today.

441
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,608
And that stops you from
being a yellow belt how?

442
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,697
If a bear's forest catches on fire,
the bear is still a bear.

443
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,496
Even if a boat capsizes
in rough seas

444
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,809
and sinks
to the bottom of the ocean

445
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,949
with no survivors,

446
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,117
it is still a boat.

447
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:12,079
You will be a yellow belt
until you die,

448
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,633
or until you're a green belt.

449
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,421
And you'll be a green belt
until you're a blue belt.

450
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,802
And so on.

451
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,723
I wish I could
wear my belt all the time.

452
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,643
I feel less-than
without it.

453
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,437
Come with me.

454
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,952
I want you to tell me
why you're here.

455
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,332
I... I told you before.
It was my New Year's resolution.

456
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,750
I thought you said
it was health and fitness.

457
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,374
That's what I meant.

458
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,252
Why are you really here?

459
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,425
I was mugged.

460
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,766
At night.
A few months ago.

461
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,559
I was beaten, severely,
by several men.

462
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,029
I'm afraid.

463
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,611
I'm afraid of the dark.

464
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,694
I'm afraid of other men.

465
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,076
They intimidate me.

466
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,577
I wanna be
what intimidates me.

467
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,793
Well, you came to the right place.
You're learning karate.

468
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,963
You're a blade
and I'm sharpening you.

469
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,009
But there's a mental
component as well.

470
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,895
You mean, like,
believing in myself?

471
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,440
Yeah. That won't hurt.

472
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,561
I'm talking about
something a little different.

473
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,814
What's your favorite
style of music?

474
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,908
Adult contemporary.

475
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,535
No. Should be metal.

476
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,367
- Do you ever listen to metal?
- You mean, like hard rock?

477
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,754
Metal is much more
aggressive than hard rock.

478
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,708
- From now on, you'll listen to metal.
- Yeah.

479
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,463
It's the toughest music
there is.

480
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,795
What about hobbies?

481
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:29,843
Is there anything that you feel
particularly passionate about,

482
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,765
other than your new-found
passion for metal?

483
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,313
I enjoy France.

484
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,277
I mean, French things.
I haven't actually been to France,

485
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:44,486
but I'm learning the language
and I would like to visit there someday.

486
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,404
Mmm, that's not good.

487
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,444
Historically, the perception
of the French

488
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,536
is that they're weak and
that they surrender easily.

489
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,914
Hardly traits that
you want to embrace.

490
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,459
Russia, on the other hand,
is considered a tough country.

491
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,672
Also, Germany.
Germany is very strong and capable.

492
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,209
- My dog's breed is German.
- Excellent. German shepherd.

493
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,010
A dachshund, actually.

494
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,757
- Well, regardless, Germany it is.
- Okay.

495
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,934
You must start thinking this way.
Do you understand?

496
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:16,973
In every facet of life. What you eat.
How you interact with others.

497
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,851
What arouses you. Everything should be
as masculine as possible.

498
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:31,036
As you know,
I teach a night class.

499
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,745
This is your invitation.

500
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,667
I've never opened this class up
to yellow belts before

501
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,422
but I'm gonna make
an exception for you.

502
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,418
- What time is the class?
- It's at night. It's a night class.

503
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,679
I don't think I can.

504
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,891
I won't make you do anything,
but like the color of the belt,

505
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,226
you've earned this stripe.

506
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,681
This invitation,
it will be yours forever.

507
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:03,068
Just because you ignore it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

508
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,941
Come here.

509
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:19,201
Not only does this class offer you more
of what I believe you're looking for

510
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,918
but I guarantee you it will help you
become what you fear.

511
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,758
Casey, stop being afraid.

512
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,835
The usual? Chocolate croissant
and an orange juice?

513
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:29,025
No. I've got a new usual.
Coffee. Hot. Black. With nothing to eat.

514
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,614
- That's mine.
- It's mine now. I take what I want.

515
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,279
I only care about myself.

516
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,139
Hey there, Casey.

517
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,223
- Listening to music?
- I'm learning German.

518
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,522
German? That's very
international of you.

519
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,358
You may want to start
on those reports though.

520
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,565
That pile is getting awfully high
and I don't want you to feel obligated

521
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,438
to come in to the office
over the weekend.

522
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,241
Hey, um, Maggie asked me if you wanted
to come over for dinner.

523
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,360
What do you say?

524
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,705
Stop trying to be my friend.

525
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,866
Bosses cannot be friends.
It doesn't work that way.

526
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,493
Instead of coming over
to your house for dinner

527
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,869
with you and your wife
this weekend,

528
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,837
I think I'll stay home and masturbate
to the thought of your wife

529
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,440
wearing her bathing suit
at the barbecue.

530
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,342
- We should do push-ups.
- Hey. Shut up. Stop talking.

531
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,258
- What did you say?
- You talk too much. I don't talk, I act.

532
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,510
I punched him in the goddamn throat.
It felt amazing.

533
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,603
- Who?
- Our boss, Grant.

534
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,314
Do you want to join us?

535
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,196
But there's just
the three chairs.

536
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:54,360
I'll sit in your chair.

537
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,334
Ah.

538
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,371
We should do push-ups.

539
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,760
You're a good dog
and I care for you.

540
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,517
That said, I won't be
petting you anymore.

541
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,859
I've been coddling you.
This is for your own good.

542
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,522
Sorry.

543
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,734
What are you doing?

544
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,137
You're not supposed to be here.
You don't have a black stripe.

545
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,986
I thought
you were my friend.

546
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,366
A friend wouldn't say
they were a day class student

547
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,284
and then go to the night class
behind my back.

548
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,493
I didn't...

549
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,638
Our limbs get their strength
from leverage points.

550
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,519
An elbow can
only bend one way

551
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,962
because if it could bend more than
one way it would be weaker.

552
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,855
But this design is also
inherently flawed.

553
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,487
Henry, come on up to the front.
I want you to help me demonstrate something.

554
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,786
Watch closely.

555
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,182
Leverage is a weapon. You can use it
or it can be used against you.

556
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,555
You earned your blue belt.
I know I could never take that from you.

557
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,607
So I took your arm instead.

558
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:22,397
Never come back here.
Not even for the day class.

559
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:32,787
Everyone, I'd like you
to welcome Casey to the night class.

560
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,621
He's a yellow belt.

561
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,046
All right. Let's begin.

562
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,142
You're done
for the night.

563
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:07,733
So is he.

564
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,493
Can you drag him
off the mat?

565
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,258
Learn to love
this feeling.

566
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,555
Your bones aching.
Your chest screaming.

567
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,178
This is karate.

568
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,597
I have nothing else.

569
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:47,690
Congratulations on a great class, everyone.
Let's begin the cool-down.

570
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,473
They're all gonna
cool down on the mat,

571
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,582
but since
it's your first time,

572
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,366
I want you to cool down
away from the others.

573
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,525
Come with me.

574
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,773
I know you're probably a little confused
about what's happening.

575
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,590
Just know that every one
of them out there

576
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,250
had to do this
at one point.

577
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,228
Again, I'm sorry
to make you cool down with her.

578
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,933
She's a woman so her hands are naturally
weaker than a man's.

579
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,061
An after-workout sports massage works
best with strong hands,

580
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,775
so I know
this is not ideal.

581
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,903
A massage from a woman
is still better than a self-massage.

582
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,832
Well, what are you
waiting for, yellow belt?

583
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,589
Take off your jacket
and sit in front of me.

584
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,935
Sorry.

585
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,611
I know they're not
as strong as a man's.

586
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,157
So, this is the women's
changing room.

587
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,037
It is.

588
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:08,125
It's the same as the men's in every way,
only it's smaller and not as nice.

589
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,626
How long have you
been taking karate?

590
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:15,000
I was one of the dojo's first students
when it opened.

591
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,797
And how long
have you been a brown belt?

592
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,012
The cool-down
is supposed to be silent.

593
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,272
Why was he promoted
to black belt before you?

594
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,566
Is that why
you fought him tonight?

595
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,728
You could have killed him.

596
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,982
- It looked like you wanted to.
- I was proving a point.

597
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,608
- About your belt?
- No.

598
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,777
About why I'm here.

599
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,201
Never hold back.

600
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,582
Not ever.

601
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,457
It will only make you weak,
and you can't be weak anymore.

602
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:53,830
Not in the night classes.

603
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,340
Do you understand?

604
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,504
I think I do.

605
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,715
But then again,
maybe I don't.

606
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,641
You will.

607
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,358
This isn't
a safe place, Casey.

608
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:30,749
My turn.

609
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,377
You can come in.

610
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,684
Your belt. It's yellow.

611
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,229
I had it made.

612
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,934
It's for everyday use
with casual clothing.

613
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:56,192
Obviously, I chose yellow
because I am a yellow belt.

614
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,106
I wanted to wear
my yellow belt all the time

615
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,695
but I knew
it would look strange.

616
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,819
That really is
a wonderful idea.

617
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,701
To be honest,
I wish I'd thought of it.

618
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,744
Now I can be a yellow belt
in everyday life,

619
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,238
in addition to being one
in this dojo.

620
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,037
I mentioned before
that I had it made.

621
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,002
It was a special order.

622
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,789
The thing is, the belt company
wouldn't make just one.

623
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,419
I had to make
at least 50.

624
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:28,220
The positive out of this is that
I have enough for all the other students.

625
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,352
I even had them make
a black one for you.

626
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,475
I think it turned out
quite nice.

627
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,343
I don't know what to say.

628
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,175
I'm honored.

629
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,682
How much
did all this cost?

630
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,597
Oh, don't worry about that.
This is my gift to the academy.

631
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,722
Although I was let go from my accounting job
the other day, unexpectedly.

632
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,310
You have
accounting experience?

633
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,898
Oh, 10 years,
or 120 months.

634
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,905
I'm looking for someone
to help manage the books here.

635
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,790
I can't keep up
with the growth of the academy.

636
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,863
There's more money coming in.
It's overwhelming.

637
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,578
I could use a mind
like yours.

638
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,824
It wouldn't be permanent.
Just till you get things on track.

639
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,415
Well, thank you.
Yes. The answer is yes.

640
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,750
Good.

641
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,922
You'll start tomorrow.

642
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,965
I'm sure you'll find another job
by the time you finish

643
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,429
organizing the books here.

644
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,510
- Casey.
- Yes?

645
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,391
I really am excited
about the belt.

646
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,322
- Hello?
<i>- Casey?</i>

647
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,406
Who is this?

648
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,451
<i>The men you told me about,
would you know them if you saw them?</i>

649
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:16,950
Is that you, Sensei?

650
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,331
<i>The men.
The ones who attacked you.</i>

651
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,830
- I...
<i>- Would you know their faces?</i>

652
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,459
They were wearing helmets.
Motorcycle helmets.

653
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,716
<i>- So you didn't see their faces?</i>
- Why are you asking me this?

654
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,259
<i>The other day,
when you told me about</i>

655
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,382
<i>what happened to you,</i>

656
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:33,803
<i>it made me angry.</i>

657
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,635
<i>I have resources.</i>

658
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,433
<i>I found one of the men
who attacked you, Casey.</i>

659
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,139
<i>I need you to meet me.</i>

660
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,558
<i>But I won't be sure.</i>

661
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,480
<i>It was dark.</i>

662
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,605
<i>And like I was saying,
they were wearing motorcycle helmets.</i>

663
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,610
<i>It's him.
You have to trust me.</i>

664
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,736
<i>You trust me, don't you?</i>

665
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,203
Did you park in the garage
like I asked?

666
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,296
Yeah.
There was a motorcycle.

667
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,836
I'm glad you came.

668
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,149
I see you're wearing
your belt for strength.

669
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,929
Me too.

670
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,717
Not only does it represent
my black belt in karate

671
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,594
but it also helps
keep my pants up.

672
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,021
Yeah. So, where is he?

673
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,271
In the bar.

674
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,148
I still don't... Are you...
Are you sure it's him?

675
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,657
- Very sure.
- But how?

676
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,531
How what? You saw the motorcycle
with your own eyes.

677
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,820
How did you find him?

678
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,366
- You don't need to worry about that.
- Well, what does he look like?

679
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:44,788
He wears a hat sometimes,
but not always.

680
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,339
There he is.

681
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,092
- That's the man we're looking for.
- Him?

682
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,217
Yeah. He matches
the description I gave you.

683
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,119
He's not wearing a hat, but I told you
he doesn't always wear one.

684
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,472
I just don't think we should do this.
Not like this.

685
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,043
Although I do appreciate
you trying to...

686
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,768
I'm not giving you
the choice, Casey.

687
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,062
Out here's no different
than in my dojo.

688
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:12,315
That belt that you're wearing
is still yellow and mine's still black.

689
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,929
I'm your teacher and you're my student
and you'll do as you're told.

690
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,539
And understand this. I'm not helping you.
You're helping yourself.

691
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,166
Remember what he did to you.

692
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,501
He stole your dignity.

693
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,833
Take it back.

694
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,140
Hi.

695
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,977
Do you remember me?

696
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,055
I don't think.

697
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,315
Hey!
Look at me.

698
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,275
I'm talking to you.

699
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,271
Do you remember my face?

700
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,405
Good night.

701
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,631
No. Don't touch him.

702
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,672
Don't touch him.
He's still breathing.

703
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,432
What are you doing?

704
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,679
You taught him a lesson.

705
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,101
He and his friends will definitely
think twice before messing with you again.

706
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,396
- Why are you filming this?
- I'm documenting.

707
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:13,819
Documenting what?

708
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:15,900
Your growth.

709
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:23,283
See you tomorrow.

710
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,143
We'll get you started with determining
which accounts are delinquent

711
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,375
and then, if we have enough time,
we'll move on to organizing the receipts

712
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,165
for the business-related
purchases.

713
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,878
You did the right thing.
You'll see.

714
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,028
I'm sorry.
There was nothing we could do.

715
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,741
Did he go peacefully?

716
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,915
No. It was likely
very painful.

717
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,917
There was a great deal
of trauma.

718
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,002
What do you mean, "trauma"?

719
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,164
Well, the X-rays indicated
there were broken ribs

720
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,378
and severe bruising
to the internal tissue.

721
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,293
I don't understand.

722
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,633
Did you hurt your dog?

723
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,136
Of course not. No.
He was my best friend.

724
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,302
I left him alone in my house
and when I came back...

725
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,914
Did you notice anything
out of place?

726
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,396
I... I don't know.
I came straight here.

727
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,023
Do you think
someone did this to him?

728
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,811
- We found blood on his canines.
- He bit them?

729
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,486
It seems he fought to the very end.
He was very brave.

730
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,946
I tried my best
not to coddle him.

731
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,951
I know this is hard.
I don't want to upset you.

732
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:34,994
But it's the strangest thing.
He died from a punch. I'm sure of it.

733
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:41,297
Only, the bruising pattern doesn't seem
to indicate a fist but rather a foot.

734
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,004
I know. It doesn't
make any sense.

735
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,845
Sometimes your opponent
will be bigger than you,

736
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:56,144
but remember this. You're children.
You're still growing.

737
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,810
If they defeat you in combat, there will
always be the opportunity later in life,

738
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,313
when you are fully grown,
to exact your revenge.

739
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,637
Casey, we're in
the middle of a class.

740
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,372
What are you doing?

741
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,372
I'm wearing shoes
on the mat.

742
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,707
Also, I didn't bow.

743
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,501
What happened?

744
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,880
- What is it? You can tell me.
- I'm hungry.

745
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,306
Don't do this.

746
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,524
All this not bowing and eating
on the mat has made me thirsty.

747
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,609
Rule number nine. Stay hydrated.

748
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,286
- Enough.
- You killed my dog!

749
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,450
- When?
- Last night.

750
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,295
I was with you
last night.

751
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,124
Casey, that's impossible.

752
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,071
Is that the dog that you were telling me
was of German lineage?

753
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,007
He was a dachshund,
you son of a bitch.

754
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:12,759
Dachshund. Short of stature, long of body.
Not the most masculine of breeds.

755
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,928
No, unfortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

756
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,230
My condolences.

757
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,938
Fuck you
and fuck your dojo.

758
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,361
As I said already,
I was with you last night.

759
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,947
I saw what you did to that man,
that innocent man.

760
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,364
You said
he was one of them.

761
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,906
And deep down, you knew
he didn't have anything to do

762
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,516
with whatever happened to you
and yet you did what you did anyway.

763
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,498
- You're insane.
- It didn't matter to you, did it?

764
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,290
You wanted to take out your pain
and frustration on someone else

765
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,916
and you needed to become
what you hated.

766
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,635
I'm done.
This isn't karate.

767
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,216
I have it all
on tape.

768
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,619
The man from last night
has two choices.

769
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,710
Either become a better version of himself...

770
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,248
...or succumb
to his weaknesses.

771
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:27,758
You gave him that choice,
and his life will never be the same.

772
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,761
That night all those months ago
was the best thing

773
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,755
that ever happened to you
and you know it.

774
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,180
You are who you always
wanted to be.

775
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,807
Karate has changed you.

776
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,605
Channel this energy
into class tonight.

777
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,949
And take your shoes off.

778
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:11,168
Okay, children.
Back to work.

779
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:24,356
In the art of accounting,
I'm a white belt,

780
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,811
and you are
a fiscal black belt.

781
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,658
- Did you kill my dog?
- No.

782
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,366
Even if it wasn't a masculine dog,
I didn't kill it.

783
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,576
But I'm gonna
make this right.

784
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,456
You'll see.

785
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,419
I've been having trouble
controlling my emotions lately.

786
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,503
I'm sorry.

787
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,595
It's a very masculine trait.
Embrace it.

788
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,554
Women are
much cooler-headed.

789
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:07,023
I want you to come
work for me full-time.

790
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,276
This is
a part-time job at best.

791
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,271
I want you to take over
the children's class.

792
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,652
- What about Anna?
- Let me worry about Anna.

793
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:18,156
But she's easily the most qualified person
for this position.

794
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,122
I'm just a yellow belt.
She's almost a black belt.

795
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,038
Anna will never
be a black belt.

796
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,036
To be honest, I didn't ever think
she'd last this long.

797
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,339
When she earned her blue belt,
I put her in charge of the children's class

798
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:33,834
due to her innate maternal instincts.
She is a woman.

799
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,929
But she let her feminine tendencies
interfere with her karate.

800
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:43,386
I realize now that her being a woman will
prevent her from ever becoming a man.

801
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,324
You know, there are
things in life that men do

802
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,110
and there are things in life
that women do.

803
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,280
There are some things
that women and men do together,

804
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,624
like ride a tandem bicycle
or have sex.

805
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:11,038
But even then, men ride a tandem bicycle
to please the woman

806
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,002
and sex is
the other way around.

807
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,588
Karate...

808
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,547
Karate's a thing for men.

809
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,802
It's time
for the night class.

810
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,311
I just wanted to say
thank you for the belts.

811
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:38,027
Oh. Of course. Yeah.
I'm so glad you like them.

812
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,575
Like it? I love it.

813
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,905
Now, while I'm walking
around in public,

814
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,080
I can still feel
like a brown belt

815
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,451
by wearing this brown belt.
Thank you.

816
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,623
Tonight, I want you, you,

817
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,552
and you.

818
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,843
How big is your head?

819
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,092
Uh, regular size.

820
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,015
Finish getting dressed.
Meet me out the back.

821
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,880
I don't think
I can do this.

822
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,675
Did you hear me?
I can't do this.

823
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,008
Yes, you can.
You'll be fine.

824
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,551
- You're not coming.
- I'm coming.

825
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,800
- We don't need you.
- Casey can take my place as runner.

826
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,097
I'll be the driver
this time.

827
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,956
Otherwise you'll only have
three drivers and one runner.

828
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,620
You need the extra runner
and you know it.

829
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,355
Put it on. Do it.

830
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,830
<i>I want you two
to play spotters.</i>

831
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,137
We'll do it.

832
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,059
No.

833
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,559
You're lucky I even let you
ride with us tonight.

834
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,026
Thomas is
too recognizable.

835
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,673
You can see his disgusting face
and bandages

836
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:40,733
even with
the helmet on.

837
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,823
Casey has to do it.
He needs to prove himself.

838
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:48,950
<i>It's time, Casey.
Go find us someone to help.</i>

839
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,372
<i>They have to be alone.</i>

840
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,738
You should have never
started taking karate, Casey.

841
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,594
- But you did.
- We don't have to do this.

842
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:06,800
He'll kill us if we don't.

843
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,071
Everything's gonna be okay,
but one of us has to hurt him, Casey.

844
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:24,860
I can't.

845
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,488
Then wait here.

846
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,451
Who are you?

847
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,371
Stop!

848
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:39,872
Police! Stop! Show me
your hands! Police!

849
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,464
Shit.

850
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,210
I didn't mean to shoot your friend.
Please, stop.

851
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,128
Stop where you are!
Show me your hands!

852
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,006
It was an accident.

853
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,028
Casey!

854
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,535
Casey!

855
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,253
Casey! Casey,
we have to leave now!

856
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,262
<i>They got our guy.
He's dead. They got away.</i>

857
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,764
You know, one of the jobs
of the spotter

858
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,724
is to ask the person
if they have a gun.

859
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,632
And that man had a gun.
Why didn't you ask if he had a gun?

860
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,477
My kicks aren't gonna be
so strong anymore.

861
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,391
The bullet
only grazed you.

862
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,691
Imprecise and boorish.

863
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,438
Hey, this is your fault.

864
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,366
Remind me to put a red stripe
on your belt tomorrow.

865
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,064
What? The stripe for instructors?
You... You can keep that.

866
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,785
Red stripes aren't for instructors.
It's for ending a life.

867
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:41,001
Red represents blood.
There's no stripe for instructors.

868
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:44,462
A yellow belt with both
black and red stripes...

869
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,089
Unprecedented.

870
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,923
- Thomas, take Anna home.
- No.

871
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:53,009
I'll do it.

872
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,351
So, how did you get yours?

873
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,471
This one on the right.

874
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:08,190
My what?

875
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,566
Your stripe.
The red one.

876
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,782
It was another student.

877
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,874
He was a belt above me.

878
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,914
The highest ranked at the time,
other than Sensei.

879
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,374
I was better than him.

880
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:30,880
I knew it, but I also
knew my place.

881
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,218
And during
the sparring sessions,

882
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,508
I let him win 'cause I didn't want to
upset the hierarchy.

883
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:37,723
As you've probably noticed,
there's a hierarchy in karate.

884
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,386
At this point,
the dojo only had

885
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,645
one changing room,

886
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,183
so I would wait until
the men finished changing,

887
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:47,601
then I would
get dressed alone.

888
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,646
And one night, as I was
getting undressed,

889
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,441
the upper belt came in
and attacked me from behind.

890
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,365
I'd always
held back in class,

891
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,784
so he saw me as weak.

892
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,870
An easy target.

893
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,255
I ended up strangling him
to death with his own belt.

894
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,134
I made him suffer.

895
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,968
And the last thing he saw
before his eyes burst was

896
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,721
the sense of satisfaction
on my face.

897
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,854
He saw that I was not weak,

898
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,516
but strong.

899
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,360
I've never held
anything back since.

900
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,532
After that, Sensei had
the old equipment closet

901
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,238
converted into the women's
changing room.

902
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:40,574
He said that I had
tempted the upper belt.

903
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,164
That it was my fault.

904
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,374
But it wasn't your fault.

905
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,419
I know.

906
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,508
Thanks for the ride.

907
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,352
I hope I never see you
in class again, Casey.

908
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,598
I hope you leave and never
come back. I really do.

909
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:43,460
<i>You're gonna kill him.</i>

910
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:46,504
<i>He's trying to kill him.</i>

911
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,532
<i>You think you're the only one
that deserves a red stripe?</i>

912
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,549
<i>I deserve a red stripe
just as much as you. Maybe more.</i>

913
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,892
<i>He looks very weak
and hopeless.</i>

914
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,555
<i>Chances of him making something of
his life are minimal.</i>

915
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,606
<i>- Go ahead.
- Wait.</i>

916
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:03,727
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

917
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,066
<i>Sirens.</i>

918
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,030
<i>I hear sirens.</i>

919
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,650
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>

920
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,513
<i>Women are much more sensitive
to higher-pitched sounds than men.</i>

921
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,699
<i>Trust me. I hear sirens approaching.
We should leave.</i>

922
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:18,578
<i>Take his wallet.</i>

923
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,144
I'm going to kill you.

924
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,193
Do you want
to know why?

925
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:39,154
I could say it's for
the honor of the dojo.

926
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:44,243
I could tell you it's because you're
blackmailing former students

927
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,787
into paying membership fees
long after they leave.

928
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:53,419
Or because private lessons are given
to those who do not ask for them.

929
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,708
Like myself.

930
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:00,429
But really
it's because I hate you.

931
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,342
I hate you very much.

932
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,429
And not only do I want
to watch you die,

933
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,649
but I want to be the reason
that you stop breathing.

934
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:16,237
I've never wanted anything
more in my entire life.

935
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,116
I'm going to
kill you, Leslie.

936
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,285
That's right.

937
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,330
I found out that
your real name is Leslie.

938
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:33,249
I called you that
to make you angry.

939
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:35,877
When you think about it,

940
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:39,134
Leslie is a lot more
feminine-sounding than Casey.

941
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,467
I can make you a black belt.

942
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:46,805
You can skip all the other colors.
You don't even need to earn it.

943
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:53,774
I challenge you to a fight to the death,
in unarmed combat.

944
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:57,443
You'll lose.

945
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,232
I'm better at fighting
than you.

946
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:10,954
Very well.

947
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,124
I accept.

948
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,176
I've been thinking
a lot lately,

949
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,179
about what I would say to you
after I killed you.

950
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,436
I came up with two things,

951
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:57,647
and I don't want to second-guess
my choice later on,

952
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,141
so I'm going to say both.

953
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:05,777
First, you would say that using
this makes me a weak man,

954
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,699
and without question,
it does.

955
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:11,116
But I am alive
and you are dead,

956
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,199
so I would argue
it makes you the weaker man.

957
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:20,250
The second thing I came up
with is from a film I saw once.

958
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,503
I didn't play by the rules,

959
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,798
but there never
were any rules.

960
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,268
I defeated him in unarmed combat
to the death.

961
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:44,899
In the tradition
of our Grand Master,

962
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,649
I punched a hole through his head
with my index finger.

963
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,619
It was a move that only Grand Master knew
but now I know it too.

964
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:57,450
I did it to restore honor to Grand Master,
this academy and its students.

965
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,626
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

966
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:02,963
Because if you do, I'm happy to punch
my finger through your skull too.

967
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,759
Good. I've killed
enough people for today.

968
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:14,721
On second thought,
there is one more thing.

969
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,598
Everyone hold their hands out
in front of them.

970
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,391
Don't make me ask again.

971
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:49,885
What's this for?

972
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,054
I sprained my wrist.

973
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:57,135
- How did you sprain it?
- Playing guitar.

974
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:00,221
- I didn't know you played.
- I do.

975
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,390
How are you
with chords and scales?

976
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:05,521
I'm good with them.
I can play several songs quite well.

977
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:09,131
What type of music were you playing
when you sprained your wrist?

978
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:10,693
Soft rock.

979
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,034
- Take off the bandage.
- Why?

980
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:17,663
Because it is impossible
to sprain your wrist playing soft rock.

981
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,782
Only extreme metal
can do that.

982
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:41,603
This is my new dog.

983
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:43,188
We've come
to an understanding.

984
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:45,148
He knows
that I'm the alpha.

985
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,618
This is not mine.

986
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:10,416
I took it,
but I did not earn it.

987
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:48,294
Now get in line,
yellow belt.

988
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:06,393
Up until this point, you've been
taught that violence equals strength

989
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,265
and compassion
equals weakness.

990
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,897
This ideology is limiting.

991
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:15,193
It is possible to be brutally tolerant
or peacefully savage.

992
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:19,280
Your karate mindset is equally as important
as your karate skill set.

993
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:23,121
You're gonna notice
some changes around here,

994
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:27,285
but this is still the night class
and you are still its students.

995
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:29,248
Do you understand?

996
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:33,541
Good.

997
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:36,418
Let's start with
some moderate stretching.

998
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,848
All right, students.
Let's start with some warm-ups.

999
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:51,691
Jumping jacks.

1000
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:57,861
One, two,
three, four, five, six...

1001
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:01,827
- Very good.
- ...seven, eight, nine, 10.

1002
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,618
Good. Everybody, well done.
Now let's do your side kicks.

1003
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,545
Very good side kicks.
Excellent form.

1004
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:24,178
Okay, everybody. Now we're doing
karate chops. Ready?

1005
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:31,477
Very good chops.

1006
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,442
Great job, Manny.
You've made great strides.

1007
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:38,989
All right, everybody.

1008
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:41,483
Now I'm going to teach you
how to kick with your fist,

1009
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:43,076
and punch with your foot.

1010
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:44,577
Are you ready?
