1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,553
--Protest U. S. involvement
in the Vietnam War.

2
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,976
Muhammad means "worthy of all praises"
and Ali means "most high."

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,561
With Marvin Gaye on WD...

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,354
- You guessed it, The Beatles...
- The astronauts of Apollo 11...

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,569
. - . began their ritual-like
preparations for this blastoff.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,574
Something is happening in our world.

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,361
Detroit's number one radio station
sponsoring--

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,530
Open Mike Night
at the Discovery Club.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,869
If you have a voice,
we want to hear it.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,582
Come on down and see if you can
knock Big Black off his block.

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,487
Come on.
I wrote this one just for you.

12
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,782
I don't know why I let you
talk me into coming.

13
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,950
I think I'm the oldest sardine
in this can.

14
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,495
- Well, you don't look it.
- Well, that's true.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,584
But it's your song.
You go up and sing it.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,340
- You're the singer in our family.
- Honey, you sing.

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,882
Yeah, but you know
how to hold people's attention.

18
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,505
People love to just hear you talk.

19
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,471
Imagine how you're gonna knock it out
when you get up there.

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,622
All right, now.

21
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,082
Fellas. Fellas.

22
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,295
Nice.

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,926
Keep that applause going.

24
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,337
Give it up one more time for Black.

25
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,222
If you guys are having a good time,
say "oh, yeah."

26
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,428
Oh, yeah!

27
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,685
Please.
I went over everything with the band.

28
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,316
Please. I just want
to hear my song. Please.

29
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,477
Are you sure you want to do this?

30
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,739
- You, are you sure?
- That man is Black!

31
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,023
You hear that?

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,693
That's the sound of success, baby.

33
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,281
What you doing?

34
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,991
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,201
Let's get a room.

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,708
Wait a minute. Bro, you see her?

37
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,370
Good God, woman.
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,289
Coming up to the stage right now
is a beautiful young lady.

39
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,879
She's just as fine as she wants to be.

40
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,215
Now, this lady is a Detroit native...

41
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,881
...and she's never been
to the Discovery Club...

42
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,392
...so I want everybody
to show her some extra love.

43
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,895
Strutting up on-stage right now...

44
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,434
...is Sister Anderson!

45
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,443
Thank you.

46
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,183
So, what's up, Mr. Manager?

47
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,477
We gonna do some business or what?

48
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,520
Black, you got to lose
some weight, baby.

49
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,315
Man, you must be crazy.
Man, all the ladies love me.

50
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,236
And besides, this old belly
is what helps me sing.

51
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,912
TV's getting bigger-

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,823
- Clothes getting smaller.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,620
- You know, you'd be good on radio.
- Man, that's cold, man. That's cold.

54
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,260
Lord have mercy!

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,602
All right.

56
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,987
I see you looking. Sure, you're right.

57
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,989
You were so great.
But we have to hurry.

58
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,946
We have five minutes
to catch the bus.

59
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,861
Give it up one more time
for Sister Anderson.

60
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,405
My goodness gracious.

61
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,539
Excuse me. Excuse me.

62
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,120
It's Sister, right?

63
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,833
You gotta forgive me for earlier.
I was all wrong about you.

64
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,124
You were foxy up there.
Promise me you'll come back next week.

65
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,044
Maybe. Maybe not.

66
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,929
- But, baby, I gotta...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,473
I really don't date younger men.

68
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,057
- No, no, please, you were so--
- I'm sorry, but we have to go.

69
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,563
Where can I find you?

70
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,064
Next time it's your turn.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,073
Hi.

72
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,824
Hi. Thank you.

73
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,241
You were so good.

74
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,500
That was so fun!

75
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,464
Yeah, it was.

76
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,926
Next time, can you get through
the chorus before you do your solo?

77
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,385
Miss Thing, next time?

78
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,642
Yeah. I have a lot more songs.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,225
Then you better get a lot more confident
and learn to sing them yourself.

80
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,684
Slavery is over.

81
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,724
Really? You're not gonna
sing anymore?

82
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,689
No.

83
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,696
Assume the position. What?

84
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,767
Y'all are late, and she's up.

85
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,490
- Sparkle. Hush.
- Sorry.

86
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,622
Hurry.

87
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,376
What y'all doing in there?

88
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,647
My babies.

89
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,354
But I know y'all don't
love each other that much.

90
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,524
Sister and Sparkle, curl your hair.

91
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,689
Church in the morning.

92
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,902
You hear me?

93
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,244
Dolores, why is my window open?
I'm not trying to heat the outside.

94
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,580
Close it.

95
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,286
- Good night.
- Good night.

96
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,712
Is she gone?

97
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,875
Y'all heifers sneak out,
and I get fussed at?

98
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,544
Laugh at-- Laugh at that.
Is that funny?

99
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,216
Peace be with you.

100
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,132
And also with you.

101
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,021
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

102
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:39,027
You know, the Lord loves a church
full of happy, good-looking black folk.

103
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,562
Amen!

104
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,572
I know y'all happy
this morning, right?

105
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,823
Yes!

106
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,907
Ain't no frowns in this
church today, is there?

107
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,702
No frowns, no clowns,
not in church.

108
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,458
And look at the choir.

109
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,914
- How y'all doing this morning?
- Good!

110
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,375
- Levi, there she go.
- What? What?

111
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,712
Seven Sundays, seven churches,
and $7 later, and I find her.

112
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,468
- That light-skinned girl?
- There.

113
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,674
Oh, man.
Well, that's Tammy Anderson.

114
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,386
Yeah, man, she is smoking hot.

115
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,175
- Tammy.
- Two sisters. They all fine.

116
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,093
- They can all sing too.
- Is that right?

117
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,979
Sure, you're right.
But they mama crazy, though.

118
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,776
Y'all know better.

119
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,734
I know I can't sing,
but I can love to hear singing.

120
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,149
'Yes!
'Right?

121
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,618
I'll see you next week, right?
Okay. See you later.

122
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,956
Excuse me. You was at the Discovery
a few weeks ago.

123
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,878
- Bible study's at your house this week?
- Yeah, it is.

124
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,422
You know, you bad at this.

125
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,974
Just act natural.

126
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,139
Hi. My name's Stix.

127
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,599
Sparkle.

128
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,564
Sara.

129
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,147
- Who is my baby talking to?
- Nineteen ain't no baby no more, Emma.

130
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,231
What? No need in eyeballing me.
I tells the truth.

131
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,023
It's in my contract as your friend.

132
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,988
I'm telling you,
you hold on too tight to that one...

133
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,995
...she'll be unmarried
and back on your doorstep like Sister.

134
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,120
That's just temporary, okay?

135
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,206
Well, New York just spit her
right on back out, huh?

136
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,495
- No.
- You know what?

137
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,336
You worry about your daughter,
I'll worry about mine.

138
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,171
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, what?

139
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,710
- Mom, I need some money.
- What?

140
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,675
They selling dinners in the basement,
and they going fast.

141
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,885
- Mom?
- Don't do it.

142
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,674
- Mama, please.
- Come with me.

143
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,969
- Now you stop.
- See y'all later.

144
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
Sparkle.

145
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,732
Let's go.

146
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,534
So I will see you
at Bible study, Sparkle?

147
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,327
Maybe.

148
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,883
Another one of my white friends
came to me the other day and said:

149
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,715
"Where's the best place
to hide something from a Negro...

150
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,255
...and he'll never find it?"

151
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,640
I told him, "A work boot. "

152
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,182
Y'all know he talking about us, right?

153
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,812
People are always asking me...

154
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,148
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

155
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,270
- Ms. Anderson, where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, second door to the right.

156
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,562
Second door.

157
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,231
- Thank you.
- Yeah, second door.

158
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,736
Ladies and gentlemen, Satin Struthers.
Let's give him a hand.

159
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,997
Great job. Thanks for coming.
Isn't he funny?

160
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,746
There you are.

161
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,457
Why you not in Bible study?

162
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,122
Haven't you heard?

163
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,508
I'm a heathen. Don't want to sit in there
and be a hypocrite.

164
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,634
Well, we already
got something in common...

165
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,388
...because I only came
just so I could ask you out.

166
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,094
The other door. To the right.

167
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,729
Other door. Sorry.

168
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,116
Oh, y'all like that, huh?

169
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,323
Funky dance, huh? You like that.
You like that music? Funky, huh?

170
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,954
It make you want to dance.
Come on.

171
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,239
Get it, Mama.

172
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,498
Yeah, Mama gonna get it.

173
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,875
Mama gonna get it.

174
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,627
And you will too.

175
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,915
You keep dancing like that,
you'll bring home a baby you can't feed.

176
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,170
Let's open our Bibles.

177
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,097
The deal was color television
for an hour of Bible study.

178
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,642
I lived up to my end,
now you live up to yours.

179
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,729
So let's go to Psalms 10--

180
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,312
Reverend Bryce called.
Says he need you to check the books.

181
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,648
The numbers are not adding up.

182
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,940
All right.

183
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,241
What are you watching?

184
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,869
Oh, I love this song.

185
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,761
No, no. Too many hormones
unattended in here.

186
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,763
Let's go. Get out. Come on.
Sister, turn that TV off.

187
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,220
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

188
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,851
- Bye, Sparkle.
- See you.

189
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,059
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

190
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,098
It was just getting good.

191
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,608
See you tonight, Sparkle.

192
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,315
- Call you later.
- All right.

193
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,820
See you next time.

194
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,448
- Bye, Tammy.
- Bye, Tune.

195
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,570
Well, good night.

196
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,410
Good night.

197
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,749
Why are all the cute ones
always so stupid?

198
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,126
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

199
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,012
All right, I'm going.

200
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,598
Please, don't stop.

201
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,179
- What are you still doing here?
- That was beautiful.

202
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,146
Wait, that's your song?
You wrote that?

203
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,978
Only if you thought it was good.

204
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,484
I thought it was phenomenal.

205
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,895
Then I wrote it.

206
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,564
So did you write that song
your sister sang...

207
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,199
...at the Discovery a few weeks back?

208
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,412
- Yes, but she kind of made it her own.
- Wait a minute.

209
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,323
You wrote that song?

210
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,537
You wrote the song you were singing?

211
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,954
You wrote the songs in here too?

212
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,168
Yes.

213
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,173
What you gonna do with the music?

214
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
- Nothing.
- Why not?

215
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,846
Because my mother
would never let me.

216
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,555
Plus, I'm not the singer in the family.
Sister is, then Dee.

217
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,266
I sing in the choir
so I don't sit by myself in church.

218
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,772
No offense,
but I'm just hearing excuses.

219
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,603
- Excuse me?
- I don't mean to be rude.

220
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,769
I'm just passionate,
especially when it comes down to music.

221
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,688
That's why I'm here.
I'm staying with my cousin, Levi.

222
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,155
I'm from Kansas City.
We got a cool jazz scene down there.

223
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,742
I managed a few acts,
but the money's here in Motown.

224
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,998
And I want to be--
I am the next Berry Gordy.

225
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,705
I figure, his stomach ain't
growling like mine anymore.

226
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,246
Maybe he's leaving a lot
of steak and potatoes out there.

227
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,795
You mind if I hear that song again?

228
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,800
Still needs a lot of work.

229
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,483
Why won't you unpack?

230
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,648
I really don't plan on
being here that long.

231
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,908
You said that two months ago.

232
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,406
Sorry

233
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,958
Hey, don't ever be sorry
for telling the truth, Spark.

234
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,831
What was that?

235
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,301
Your Romeo is out there.

236
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,340
What?

237
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,449
You can't be throwing rocks
at my window.

238
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,779
My mother has a gun.

239
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,620
A gun. A big one.

240
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
There's an underground club tonight.

241
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,042
The kind that songwriters
don't want to miss.

242
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,747
You got to hear the music.

243
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,288
It's the stuff they ain't playing
on the radio.

244
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,004
- Come with me.
- He wants me to go hear music with him.

245
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,471
You've snuck out
of the house for less.

246
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,757
And I know just the dress.

247
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,222
You coming?

248
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,851
I ain't gonna bite you.

249
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,142
And how do I know that?

250
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,611
You're gonna have to trust me.

251
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,605
Can I tell you something?

252
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,438
I think your lyrics are too safe.

253
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,570
I mean, you got Dr. King, the war.

254
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,985
I don't think the metaphorical lyrics
gonna fly anymore.

255
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,823
What?
You impressed by my big word?

256
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,158
I was.

257
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,542
In the spirit of telling the truth,
can I tell you another?

258
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,705
- I wouldn't want you to lie.
- Then why do you lie to yourself?

259
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,791
About not wanting to sing?

260
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,256
I mean, Sparkle,
you writing these songs.

261
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,342
And you can sing.

262
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,301
- So why aren't you singing them?
- I'm no Diana or Aretha.

263
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,687
You know, you right.

264
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,848
You Sparkle.

265
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,191
Look, my mom
used to sing professionally.

266
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,698
She tried to break out
and it almost killed her.

267
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,031
So thank you, but I know
the realities of this business.

268
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,867
- I'm just doing it for fun.
- You know the realities?

269
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,123
- Oh, stop.
- I'm...

270
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,288
Listen.

271
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,749
What are you afraid of?

272
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,288
Your mom or your own voice?

273
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,338
Maybe you'd be like your mom
and never reach your goals.

274
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,338
But don't fall short of it
because you can't admit that you want it.

275
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,594
Okay.

276
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,054
I want to be better than Diana.

277
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,602
I want to be a star.

278
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,693
Thank you.

279
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,656
I had a great time tonight.

280
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,245
And just in case
I never get out of that house...

281
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,376
...thank you for making me
tell the truth.

282
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,473
Sparkle...

283
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,186
...do you want to be a star?

284
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,559
What?

285
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,025
- Do you want to be a star?
- Yes, I want to be a star.

286
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,485
No, I don't believe you.
Say it like you mean it.

287
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,616
Yes, I want to be a star.

288
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,527
Okay.

289
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,367
First you have to
write a song for your sister...

290
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,532
...something where she
can work the crowd.

291
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,372
Sparkle, you gonna have to get
over your fear of singing...

292
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,412
...because you and Dee
gonna back her up.

293
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,706
I mean, everybody loves
a good girl group.

294
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,046
Now, you tweak your lyrics,
make them more raw, more relatable.

295
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,802
But Fillmore, here we come.

296
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,089
Of course, you gonna
have to win Cliff Bells.

297
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,805
- You have to be invited to compete.
- Yeah, I know. I'm gonna work on that.

298
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,471
Now, I want you to work on your sisters,
and I'll work on Cliff Bells.

299
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,311
- And you'll be our manager?
- Of course.

300
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,726
Then you manage to get my sisters.

301
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,024
Do I have you?

302
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,860
Backup, remember?

303
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,946
Good night.

304
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,618
Cliff Bells?
Come on. I'm not embarrassing myself.

305
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,876
- Didn't Marvin Gaye get booed there?
- Yeah, but it made him better.

306
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,911
Now he's traveling, making millions.

307
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,955
Mr. Gordy is making millions.

308
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,968
However it may be, it was enough
to get him out of his mama's house.

309
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,008
You don't have to be rude about it.

310
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,798
Well, I don't really know
if you were asking me.

311
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,640
You never really looked my way,
so our eyes never got to dance, but I'm in.

312
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,975
And just to be clear,
I'm in it for the money.

313
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,733
Medical school is expensive, so, no,
you won't get 20 percent. Fifteen max.

314
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,362
And once I get accepted into medical
school you will have to replace me.

315
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,239
And if you pretend
like I don't exist going forward...

316
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,992
...I will turn my sisters against you.

317
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:26,247
Other than that, sounds like fun.

318
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,624
I'll wait for you guys outside.

319
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,630
I'll let you know.
My first day at Freeman's is tomorrow.

320
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,170
Working at a department store?

321
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,550
You ain't gonna make no money.
Sparkle!

322
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,348
Come on, Sparkle.

323
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,185
- Everything I said the other night, I believe.
- You used me to get to Sister.

324
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,693
You said it yourself,
Sister is the better performer.

325
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,317
Sparkle.

326
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,033
Have you lost faith
in Mr. Johnson?

327
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,120
Well, I guess the president
would have to answer that question.

328
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,831
Oh, who doesn't like Sidney Poitier?

329
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,963
- But the movie, you liked the movie?
- Yeah, I loved the movie.

330
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,342
More importantly, the next time
you take me out, you need to have a car.

331
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,548
Oh, I'm just--

332
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,338
I'm just waiting
on the right one to buy, baby.

333
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,510
Take me on a date on a bus
in the rain?

334
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,345
You're lucky I like you.

335
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,896
Look, I don't know any other way to be
than myself. I'm a straight shooter.

336
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,032
So here we go.

337
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,237
I like you too.

338
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,573
I do, and I want to be your man.

339
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:53,121
I'm serious. I ain't like all the other
jive guys that just want to do you.

340
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,536
I heard about your reputation.

341
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,296
I just think it's what guys say...

342
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,549
...when they see something beautiful
and know they can't have it.

343
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,554
So they'd rather tear it down
than make it something they want.

344
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,801
But I see your beauty.

345
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,933
Outside and inside.

346
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,435
I want to earn it.

347
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,645
Kind of like a job.

348
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,405
Yeah, so just tell me what you need
to fall in love with me.

349
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,816
Because whatever it is, I'll do it, girl.

350
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:29,863
Whether you believe it or not,
I'm already in love with you.

351
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,287
I already heard it so much,
it all sounds like BS to me.

352
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,252
Maybe I better roll up
my sleeves then, huh?

353
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,793
- Hopefully not as high as your pants.
- What's wrong with my pants, girl?

354
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,587
- This is the style. You can see my socks.
- Change it.

355
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,427
Put some sugar in them shoes.

356
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,059
So I can sweet-talk
my pants down, huh?

357
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,225
What's this?

358
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,697
Open it up.

359
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,864
Oh, Levi.

360
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,951
I swear,
one day that's gonna be yours.

361
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,160
I promise you.

362
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,538
That's Satin Struthers.

363
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,550
Now that's some of the coolest trolling
I done seen in a long time.

364
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,254
- Did you see this cat, Ham?
- Yeah, I see him.

365
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,468
What's your name, brother?

366
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,178
Levison, but they call me Levi.

367
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,475
Levi, here I am buying the real deal
for these women...

368
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,481
...and you tell me
you cut a picture out of a magazine...

369
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,608
...and just put it in a box?

370
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,610
I'm about to go get me
some scissors...

371
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,569
...and cut some pictures out of magazines
like your boy Levi right here.

372
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,910
Clip-clip, hussies.
Clip-clip, hussies.

373
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,666
Can I see it? Let me see that.

374
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,879
This is nice.

375
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,667
You got a good man here.

376
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,509
Yep.

377
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,929
Yeah, I used to eat in here
back in the day...

378
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,593
...when I was struggling.

379
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,138
This is some real cheap,
good food.

380
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,184
But I'm not gonna hold you guys.

381
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,145
Have a good night.

382
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,236
Levi.

383
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,447
Satin.

384
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,363
- Did you see her?
- You were so wrong.

385
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,960
Tammy, I should get you home.

386
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,745
Sure.

387
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,114
Mama was so pretty.

388
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,774
Oh, here's Dee's daddy.

389
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,944
Here's a good one of
yours and Sister's daddy.

390
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,238
Cute, but no good.

391
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,577
You got to watch out
for those cute ones, baby.

392
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,742
They make a lot of promises.

393
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,786
My goodness. Lookit here.

394
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,705
Gonna be the first store
in Detroit to have one of these.

395
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,170
- She's pretty, Mama.
- Oh, a chocolate mannequin.

396
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,755
Ain't it something?

397
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,467
Dr. King said
we would have integration.

398
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,256
- That's right.
- Look what I found.

399
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,800
- What's that?
- The other, nicer you.

400
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,095
Sparkle, you go to lunch.

401
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,265
You come with me and let me try
to fit your behind in this dress.

402
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,145
- See how she do me?
- Come on.

403
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,231
She used to be real nice, girl.

404
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,780
She's in there somewhere.
Come on out, nice girl.

405
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,657
See you later.

406
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,039
I got Cliff Bells.

407
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,728
Got my first check.

408
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,978
Well, let me see.

409
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,398
Ninety-six dollars?

410
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,066
For two weeks of standing on your feet
and kissing rich white women's butts?

411
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,609
I am never gonna get out of here.

412
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,531
Stix said we can make
anywhere from 500 to $1000...

413
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,416
...if we win Cliff Bells' talent contest.

414
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,374
Don't say it all dry like that. Sell it.

415
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,414
So y'all talking to Stix now?

416
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,131
No. She was talking to Stix, I was
talking to her, now we're talking to you.

417
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,725
- You sure you want to do this?
- Yes.

418
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,352
You know, they say
you shouldn't eat where you--

419
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,729
- It's the other way around.
- She gets the point.

420
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,061
You guys, I thought about it...

421
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:54,524
...and I want to do this for me,
not for him.

422
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,152
So how much
we gonna make a week?

423
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,749
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

424
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,973
- Hello, Mr. Manager.
- Hey.

425
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,101
- Got them here, cousin.
- Surprised?

426
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,737
Yeah-- Not at all. Thank God.

427
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,166
Well, we come a dime a dozen,
don't we?

428
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,996
Coz, let me get the girls signed in.

429
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,791
Okay, okay, you do that.

430
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,341
Give them hell, baby.

431
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,131
- Levi.
- What's shaking, man?

432
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,482
Hey, can I get a picture?

433
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,656
- Here you go, man.
- Okay.

434
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,452
Satin.

435
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,375
Oh, picture-in-a-box brother.

436
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,630
Might not forget a face,
but I'll forget a name in a minute.

437
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,294
Levi, Satin. Levi.

438
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,135
Ladies, this is... See, I forgot already.

439
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,092
I got the girls signed in.

440
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,761
Righteous. Righteous.
Cousin, this is Satin Struthers.

441
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,350
- I know who it is. You're a funny man.
- Thank you.

442
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,265
This is his right hand, Hamster.

443
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,150
- Ham, man. Ham.
- Ham.

444
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,561
This is my cousin, Stix.

445
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,071
He's the manager of my girlfriend
and her sisters.

446
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,823
- They performing later tonight.
- I hope they're good.

447
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,405
I'm looking for a new act
to open up for my show.

448
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,617
Satin.

449
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,702
- Hey, Mr. Bell.
- Hey, how are you tonight?

450
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,118
- You know, hanging.
- Got a table for you in front.

451
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,287
Okay, cool. Come sit with us.

452
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,424
I'd rather have the manager
than the boyfriend.

453
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,552
Boyfriend can't do nothing for me.
Come on over here.

454
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,053
Have a good evening.

455
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,089
Nice socks.

456
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,248
They were amazing.
Give them another round of applause.

457
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,466
Hey, I see we got Mr. Satin Struthers
in the audience tonight.

458
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,127
Show him some love, y'all. Yeah.

459
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,590
Looking good too.

460
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,755
Boy cleaner than a Sunday chitlin.

461
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,136
Yeah.

462
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,803
- Coming up next is another girl group.
- Okay, go out and look pretty.

463
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,849
- This isn't what we rehearsed.
- You want to win, don't you?

464
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,766
Go.

465
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

466
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,406
...Sister and her Sisters.

467
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,263
Where in the world did you get
those church dresses?

468
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,393
What happened?
You forget the words?

469
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,020
Where is she?

470
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,228
Hey, get this man a drink.
He's gonna need one.

471
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,868
They good.

472
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,820
I'll have you booked
all over the city.

473
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,856
Diana ain't got nothing on you.

474
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,867
Hey, Sister, you were amazing.
You were amazing.

475
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,657
Sparkle, I need more of the songs.
You know, the kind we talked about.

476
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,495
- I can do that.
- All right.

477
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,331
- We need--
- We need new dresses, Mr. Manager.

478
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,418
We need to get home before
Mama wakes up and finds out we took--

479
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,709
- No, stole, the car. I'm not trying to die.
- No.

480
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,343
- Levi, drive careful.
- Yeah?

481
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,846
You got my future in this car.

482
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,056
Yes!

483
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,848
Daddy need three new, pretty dresses.
Eight ball, side pocket.

484
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,517
Damn!

485
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,399
You got this.

486
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:55,042
Thank you for your involuntary contribution
to Stix Incorporated Wardrobe Fund.

487
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,336
You was impressed by my big words,
weren't you?

488
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,176
Man, just shoot the damn ball.

489
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,724
They loved us!

490
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,061
- You finally hit that note, Sister.
- They didn't come to hear me sing, honey.

491
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,321
We need more money,
or you need to book us at a better club.

492
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,983
I know what you need
before you know.

493
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,992
Mr. Manager, that was out of sight.

494
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,374
Sparkle, I didn't know you had it like that.
And, Dee, you were good.

495
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,752
- Okay.
- But you... You.

496
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,379
Sister, you were on fire.

497
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,756
You'll mess up my lipstick.

498
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,668
Yeah, well, as much as I want
to mess up your lipstick...

499
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,552
...I gotta go to work.

500
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,258
Since when you working
the graveyard shift?

501
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,595
Since I got a woman
that's got needs, cousin. Look at her.

502
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,392
Satin.

503
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,682
- Didn't know you was still in the house.
- Yeah.

504
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,818
Let me introduce you to my family.
This is Sparkle. This is Dee.

505
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,446
- This is Satin Struthers.
- Pleased to meet you.

506
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,448
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

507
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,487
- And over here, in this corner, this is--
- We know each other.

508
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,325
Well, first, I'd like to congratulate you
on your performance.

509
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,164
- Thank you.
- And secondly...

510
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,875
...I'd like to give you something.

511
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,007
You know, dreams do come true.

512
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,215
Oh, my God.

513
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,636
- Levi!
- Trying to take my girl?

514
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,103
Get off me.

515
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,439
Let me have him!

516
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,529
- Come on, Levi.
- What's wrong with you, Negro?

517
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,238
Take me at least 30 minutes
to get my hair like this.

518
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,953
It's gonna get messed up
tonight anyway.

519
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:17,373
I'm sorry, sisters. I'm gonna go outside
and be waiting on you.

520
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,964
Oh, my God.

521
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,882
How could you do that to Levi?

522
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,302
Oh, Levi's a grown man.
He can handle himself.

523
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,096
Don't listen to her.
She's damn near 30 and not married.

524
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,060
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

525
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,519
But Levi loves you.

526
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:45,360
Spark, when you see a train that's gonna
get you to where you're trying to go...

527
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,615
...you can't wait to live.

528
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,822
You gotta jump on it.

529
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,782
He ain't got nothing else on me.

530
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,823
What he got?
More money? Better clothes?

531
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,957
What else he got?
He got nothing on me.

532
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,118
But she ain't worth it.
He ain't worth it.

533
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,754
- You my family. I'm your blood.
- Then act like it!

534
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,132
- Act like you're my blood!
- Hey.

535
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:09,296
If not for more than the drool that you
deposit on my couch every single night...

536
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,965
-...you should have had my back.
- I did have your back.

537
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,474
No, you didn't.

538
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:18,480
- You didn't have my back.
- Oh, coz.

539
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,857
It's business.

540
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,480
It's just business.

541
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,277
Levi, where you going?

542
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,250
Levi, it ain't personal.

543
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,078
Just business, right?

544
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,349
Mercy, mercy, mercy!

545
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,641
Let's get this food out here,
Miss Emma.

546
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,227
The Lord loves good-smelling food.

547
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,188
Smells so good, Mama.

548
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,569
- Thank you, baby.
- Delicious.

549
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,239
Okay. Reverend,
will you bless the food, please?

550
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,617
Sister's not here yet.
She said she was coming.

551
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,496
Sparkle, those who do, do, baby.

552
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,781
Pastor, thank you.

553
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,746
Please, bow our heads.

554
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,376
Our Father in heaven...

555
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,709
...for this meal you have given,
we want to say thank you.

556
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,342
And...bless the ones who prepared it.

557
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,629
And, Lord, as we share it,
will you stay with us...

558
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,172
...and be our guest of honor?

559
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,218
But not just at this meal,
but God in our waking...

560
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,809
...God in our speaking,
God in our playing...

561
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,564
...God in our digesting...

562
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,728
...God in our working,
God in our resting.

563
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,896
In a world where so many are lonely...

564
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:54,158
...may we share this friendship
with joyful hearts.

565
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:59,414
- Amen.
- May this food, so fresh and fragrant...

566
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:03,452
...call forth reverence for you
in our souls.

567
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,963
As you give this strength
to our perishable limbs...

568
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,216
...so give us grace
for our immortal lives.

569
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,049
And let's not forget the blessings
on this family, Father God.

570
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,682
Lord, we thank you. Amen.

571
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,012
Amen!

572
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,894
Now, that's why black folks
can't get ahead, right there.

573
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,771
Not because we lazy.

574
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,900
It's because we're too busy praying
over 40 acres and a mule.

575
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,106
Now, by the time
black folks get to "amen"...

576
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,270
...the mule is dog food...

577
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,032
...and the 40 acres is sold
from underneath us.

578
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,613
Because we too busy praying.

579
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,614
Mom, this is Satin.

580
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,247
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure is mine, all mine.

581
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,717
Two dollars say
he doesn't make it to dessert.

582
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,799
Five says he doesn't get food on his plate.
Look at Mama's face.

583
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,381
- This is Mrs. Waters.
- Pleasure.

584
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,220
- And Tune Ann.
- Hey, Tune Ann.

585
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,055
- My sisters.
- Hey.

586
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,641
And this is the Reverend Bryce.

587
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,023
What do you say, Rev?

588
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,478
Satin Struthers.

589
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,360
Yeah, yeah, I seen you on TV.

590
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,568
You were pretty hard
on the folk in Detroit after the riots.

591
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,152
Well, I was telling the truth, you know.
It shows a lack of intelligence...

592
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,491
...for someone to loot
their own neighborhood.

593
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,951
Well, people were angry.

594
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,991
At white people.

595
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,626
- Hell, go tear up they shit.
- What--?

596
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,251
Definitely not making it to dessert.

597
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,463
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hail Mary.

598
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,715
That's Catholic.

599
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,672
It's still Christian, right?

600
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,516
I mean, come on.
I understand, I understand.

601
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:46,054
I was trying to get black people
to see it from a different perspective.

602
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,474
Burning and looting your own
neighborhood may be misguided...

603
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:54,062
...but at least those people out there
were trying to fight to change the system.

604
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,026
Now, with all due respect...

605
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,943
...you just trying to
make a dollar off their pain.

606
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,365
I bet you know a little bit more about
making dollars off of people's pain.

607
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,408
You packing them
into church every Sunday.

608
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,374
Giving them a show,
got them hooting and hollering. Yeah.

609
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,583
You know what, Rev?

610
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,794
The only difference
between me and you...

611
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,005
...is you collect your fee at the pew...

612
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,170
...I collect mine at the door.

613
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,060
Well, Ms. Anderson...

614
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,068
...I guess now is a good time
for me to let you know...

615
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,571
...that I asked your daughter
to marry me.

616
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,405
Surprise.

617
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,661
He asked me last night.

618
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,699
Got down on one knee and told me
that he couldn't live without me.

619
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:52,917
Sister, you're going to marry this man?

620
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:57,676
He disrespects our home,
the reverend.

621
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,757
Oh, he's a comedian.
He was just trying to make us laugh.

622
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,673
He's a really good man.

623
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,841
Even goes to church sometimes.

624
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,763
Granted, it is for material,
but I am there...

625
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,431
-...and God knows my heart.
- Stop.

626
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,224
- I got a good heart.
- Stop.

627
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,393
He tithes.

628
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,449
Child, I think enough of you
to introduce you...

629
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,453
...to dentists and doctors
and accountants.

630
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,410
But, no, not you.

631
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,119
You want to whore with this coon.

632
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,205
- Mom!
- Sparkle.

633
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,593
Ms. Anderson,
I'm probably more of a Sambo.

634
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:48,389
I coon from time to time,
but Sambo's my go-to.

635
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,519
Baby, think more of yourself.

636
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:59,984
I know you're worried about getting older
and who's gonna marry you.

637
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,864
But get older, not desperate!

638
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,990
Desperate?

639
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,661
I'm doing a whole lot better
than you ever did.

640
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,453
Just keeping a man
is a whole lot better than you ever did.

641
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,993
- Ladies, please. I think--
- No, no, no, Reverend.

642
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,629
Let her get her attention.
She doesn't have much else.

643
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,921
- Maybe this is a conversation--
- Me getting a husband is not about me.

644
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,804
It's about her. It's not my fault
that she got knocked up at 16...

645
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,969
...and is trying to convince folks
she's the perfect mother...

646
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,682
...raised some good girls.
Sparkle's gonna follow up behind you...

647
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,848
...and be a little church mouse
and make dresses.

648
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,267
And if she's lucky,
she'll be a preacher's wife.

649
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,563
Dee's gonna be a doctor,
and I'm just supposed to marry one?

650
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,403
Funny thing is,
maybe I could have snagged one...

651
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,818
...if you'd sent me to school
like these two.

652
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,988
But instead, I was at home,
raising your kids...

653
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,156
...while you were laid up
in your own vomit.

654
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,166
Sister...

655
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,953
...if you gonna tell my tragic story...

656
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,123
...give me the honor
of getting it correct.

657
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,299
Yeah, I passed out a few times.

658
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,086
Sure, I've had my moments.

659
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:11,760
But you've never, ever, ever
seen me laying in my own vomit.

660
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,553
Whatever you say, Mama.

661
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:19,942
The fact is, I was desperate back then.

662
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,398
Right now,
I'm trying to get myself out of here...

663
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,565
...and get myself more than
a color TV and half a room.

664
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,028
It's okay.

665
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,501
Well, we better go.

666
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,710
Ms. Anderson, thanks for what looked like
could have been a great dinner.

667
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,338
We better go.

668
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,677
Sister!

669
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:55,595
You leave my house,
there's no coming back.

670
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,896
Not this time.

671
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,411
Sparkle. Sparkle!

672
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,168
Are you still gonna be
part of the group?

673
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,461
That's not exactly
what was on my mind, Spark.

674
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,504
Yeah, sure.

675
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,103
Dee, say something.

676
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,569
Congratulations.

677
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,982
Thank you.

678
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,572
Thank you.

679
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,074
Come here.

680
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,586
I love you, Spark.

681
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,629
It's okay.

682
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,928
Where you want to go?

683
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,812
Anywhere.

684
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,332
Close your eyes.

685
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,346
Okay, you can open them.

686
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,515
Your cup of coffee, sir.

687
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,441
I appreciate it, baby.

688
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,320
You know, Daddy got to wake up
a little faster and a little stronger.

689
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,483
You'll be surprised with
what this gonna do when we make love.

690
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:01,243
Can't be any better than it already is.

691
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,476
- Are you catching a cold?
- No, I'm fine.

692
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,891
Okay, from "You bring out
the woman in me."

693
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,934
Five, six, seven, eight.

694
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,782
Can you not hit my hand every time?

695
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,115
Okay, come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

696
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,165
Y'all ain't got to go home...

697
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,499
...but you know the rest.

698
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:54,341
Oh, they were just leaving.

699
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,218
Baby, you got some
cab fare for them?

700
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,253
Cab fare?

701
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,680
You the one opening for
Aretha Franklin.

702
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:05,428
I mean, hell, if I had any sense,
I'd be living off your ass.

703
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,517
- I'm funny, Sparkle? I'm funny?
- Yeah.

704
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,778
So you laughing at me
like them white folks that I coon for?

705
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,527
- No.
- Satin.

706
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,987
Well, you should.

707
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,824
That's how I'm paying
for all this heat you sucking up.

708
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,455
- Satin, I'm just--
- Let's just go. Come on, just go.

709
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,161
Grab your book.

710
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,549
Ready for TV, Ms. Sparkle?

711
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,086
Oh, my God, Ms. Franklin!

712
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,300
Hello.

713
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,056
Today ain't the day
to be fashionably late.

714
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,262
You're fine.

715
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,802
Stix says Ms. Franklin's not here.
Running late.

716
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,306
I'm worried because that's gonna
cut it close to us getting home.

717
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,689
Sure is.

718
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,150
Do you have any more pins?

719
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,313
I'm running out of mine over here
and I need some more.

720
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,732
I can't get this thing on.

721
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,443
What happened to your face?

722
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,737
Oh, it ain't nothing.

723
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,530
He did that to you, didn't he?

724
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,324
I had an accident.

725
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,584
Oh, so, what,
you tripped and hit his fist?

726
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,994
Get out.

727
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,791
Excuse me?

728
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,586
I told you to get out of my face.

729
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,092
He's beating you,
and you're taking it out on me?

730
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,050
- Just go. Go! Get out!
- No!

731
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,385
I don't need to hear this.

732
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,223
- Jeez, she's always in my business!
- Somebody ought to be!

733
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,138
- Shut up.
- You guys, stop. Don't do this!

734
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,477
Not tonight.

735
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,271
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

736
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,278
We have to open up for
Aretha Franklin tonight, right?

737
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,284
- Right?
- Right.

738
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:48,698
Well, Sister can't fly on one wing.

739
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:43,908
Well, I'll be damned.

740
01:00:47,531 --> 01:00:50,626
- Just amazing.
- I know. They're special.

741
01:00:51,326 --> 01:00:54,000
Ladies, we have a special guest.

742
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:56,837
This is Mr. Larry Robinson
of Columbia Records.

743
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:58,046
- Hi.
- Hi.

744
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,678
Oh, listen to that.
They even say "hi" in harmony.

745
01:01:01,837 --> 01:01:05,216
Mr. Robinson is senior A&R
at Columbia in Los Angeles.

746
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:08,010
He set up an office here
because he's looking for talent.

747
01:01:08,177 --> 01:01:11,431
- He wants to talk to us about a--
- Excuse me, may I share?

748
01:01:11,597 --> 01:01:12,940
- Sure.
- Could this be my news?

749
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:15,021
- By all means.
- Great.

750
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:17,903
First off, you were fantastic.

751
01:01:18,061 --> 01:01:19,278
Fantastic!

752
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:21,691
- Thanks.
- I want to sign you.

753
01:01:21,857 --> 01:01:23,484
I'm going to sign you.

754
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,824
I just need to, you know,
see what you're gonna look like...

755
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:31,208
-...waking up next to me in the morning.
- Stix, what is this?

756
01:01:31,366 --> 01:01:33,118
You know, that was an expression.

757
01:01:33,285 --> 01:01:36,334
- Okay.
- And it's more like...

758
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:39,124
...I want to see you in the light of day.

759
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,714
- That's a better expression.
- Way better.

760
01:01:41,877 --> 01:01:45,131
I'm gonna gather
a bunch of my colleagues together...

761
01:01:45,297 --> 01:01:49,143
...and you will wow us.

762
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,429
And, you know, this is your fault.

763
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:52,847
It is your fault.

764
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,482
I don't even know
if you guys can actually sing.

765
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:57,564
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

766
01:01:57,726 --> 01:01:59,979
Look at that, she's playing coy.

767
01:02:00,145 --> 01:02:02,147
This is the coy one.

768
01:02:02,314 --> 01:02:06,364
Well, that's all right.
Coy plays on any number of levels.

769
01:02:06,526 --> 01:02:08,278
So great.

770
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:10,664
Well, see you next week.

771
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:12,199
- Bye.
- Thank you.

772
01:02:12,366 --> 01:02:16,496
- Y'all wowed him!
- Look. You got a line coming in here, girls.

773
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,543
- Satin.
- Stix.

774
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,633
You been fighting?

775
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:27,006
No, I got a new cat.

776
01:02:27,172 --> 01:02:29,595
- Yeah, yeah, cat.
- That's a big-ass cat.

777
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:32,056
Sure is.

778
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:35,689
Ladies, you better get out of here.
Called the cab, it's waiting out front.

779
01:02:36,723 --> 01:02:39,442
I saw you singing to me, teasing me.

780
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:43,272
Y'all wowed them. And I got to run.

781
01:02:43,438 --> 01:02:45,907
See if I can talk to Mr. Gordy,
get us a bidding war.

782
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,067
That's right.

783
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:49,578
- Satin.
- Stix.

784
01:02:54,908 --> 01:02:56,785
Let's go, baby. You ready to go?

785
01:03:01,331 --> 01:03:02,628
Y'all her new bodyguards?

786
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:05,590
We're big-ass cats.

787
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:24,150
Come on, let's go.
Mama would let you back into the house.

788
01:03:24,855 --> 01:03:27,984
- You guys, really, I fell.
- You said Mom used to fall a lot too.

789
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:32,371
- You even picked her up a few times.
- It was only one time.

790
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:34,327
Too many.

791
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:36,158
Sister, come home with us.

792
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:39,244
Let's go.

793
01:03:40,078 --> 01:03:41,751
Come on.

794
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:01,983
Bravo!

795
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:58,953
- Mama, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

796
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:04,167
Was my life not enough
of a cautionary tale for you?

797
01:05:05,122 --> 01:05:07,716
Just a mean mama,
won't let you follow your dreams?

798
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:11,378
Well, I guess I'll be mean.

799
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:14,799
I will not encourage you
to drive your lives straight into hell.

800
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:18,552
To be honest,
I can take it or leave it...

801
01:05:18,718 --> 01:05:20,561
...but we are close
to getting a deal.

802
01:05:21,471 --> 01:05:23,473
They say Sister could be
like Diana Ross...

803
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,984
...and Sparkle could be
the next Smokey Robinson...

804
01:05:26,143 --> 01:05:28,145
...as far as songwriting is concerned.

805
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:30,655
Dolores, I've made it
very simple in this house.

806
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:36,571
Respect, getting an education,
and having a relationship with the Lord.

807
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:38,704
If you can't do that, then go.

808
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,583
Why would the Lord give me this gift
if I wasn't supposed to use it?

809
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,128
What'd you say?

810
01:05:51,585 --> 01:05:53,929
All I think about is music.

811
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:56,886
Everything I see, hear or feel
turns into a song.

812
01:05:57,048 --> 01:06:00,143
And I try to turn it off, but I can't.

813
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:03,727
And I know the Lord loves me
and he wouldn't torture me...

814
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:06,233
...with something I want to do,
can't help but do.

815
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:09,395
- So I figured I--
- You figured I was wrong.

816
01:06:11,605 --> 01:06:12,902
That I had a gift.

817
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:18,829
Sparkle, you can have a gift.

818
01:06:18,987 --> 01:06:21,615
It's how you use it.

819
01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:23,583
You want to promote good...

820
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:26,871
...or you want more fast-tailed girls
out there having children?

821
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:31,967
"Giving him something he can feel
to let him know his love is real"?

822
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,217
Mama, that's private.

823
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:35,925
Sparkle, it's trash.

824
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:40,051
- No, it's not.
- Oh, yes, it is.

825
01:06:46,932 --> 01:06:50,436
We're sorry for disrespecting you
and the rules of your house.

826
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:53,522
If you want me to go, I'll go.

827
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:57,450
But I can't stop now, Mama,
I'm too close.

828
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:04,287
Another little girl with a dream,
thinks she's so different...

829
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:07,248
...than all the others
waiting to be discovered.

830
01:07:08,036 --> 01:07:09,128
You go to your meeting.

831
01:07:09,287 --> 01:07:12,166
In fact, I want you to,
so you can see what I already know.

832
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:14,755
You ain't getting no deal!

833
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:18,092
You step back in this house,
and you want to stay in this house...

834
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:22,180
...then this dream of yours is over.
Do you understand?

835
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:24,560
Do you understand?

836
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,204
I am so proud of you.

837
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:48,119
So proud.

838
01:07:48,285 --> 01:07:50,379
You better keep writing those songs.

839
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:02,557
Hey, baby.

840
01:08:05,135 --> 01:08:06,978
What are you doing?

841
01:08:10,724 --> 01:08:13,523
Listen, I got something
I need you to read for me.

842
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,437
What's this, new material?

843
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:19,359
Now, I wants to keep my white money,
but I think this is a way...

844
01:08:19,524 --> 01:08:22,903
...to cross over
so I can get my black audience.

845
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:26,664
You know, Ham got me a gig
down over at Baker's.

846
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:30,376
Tell me what you think.

847
01:08:31,161 --> 01:08:32,378
I'm honored.

848
01:08:34,456 --> 01:08:37,460
And I'm thrilled, and I'm happy.

849
01:08:37,626 --> 01:08:39,173
Come here.

850
01:08:40,211 --> 01:08:42,805
And I'm horny.

851
01:08:50,096 --> 01:08:51,598
Come on, baby. Right now, baby.

852
01:08:51,765 --> 01:08:54,769
Come on, come on, baby,
we got to stay focused.

853
01:08:54,934 --> 01:08:56,811
Okay.

854
01:09:01,524 --> 01:09:03,151
Baby?

855
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:07,038
Tell me the truth.

856
01:09:07,197 --> 01:09:09,495
Why'd the chicken cross the road?

857
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:12,286
Because two black guys
were chasing him with a biscuit.

858
01:09:16,998 --> 01:09:20,969
No, because the chicken was trying
to get away from your turkey ass.

859
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:31,183
Two black guys
walking down the street.

860
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:32,723
Boy, they were just walking.

861
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:36,484
- They were walking, they were walking...
- Finally they said, "You know what?

862
01:09:36,643 --> 01:09:39,863
We need a punch line right here,
because this joke ain't got none."

863
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:47,988
My joke ain't got no punch line,
but you brought your girl to see me.

864
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:51,909
Well, I had to, you know, bring her
to see how funny you were not.

865
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:56,250
You see, ladies and gentlemen?

866
01:09:56,413 --> 01:09:59,337
You give a monkey some money,
and he just don't know how to act.

867
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:02,218
What's the matter?
You don't dig my sense of humor?

868
01:10:06,756 --> 01:10:08,053
Man, you ain't shit.

869
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:14,022
And I'm gonna show you why.
I ought to kick your ass!

870
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:18,439
You want to play?
You're a wannabe!

871
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:21,400
- Snip-snip, hussy.
- You are nothing!

872
01:10:21,563 --> 01:10:22,780
Nothing!

873
01:10:22,939 --> 01:10:27,490
Y'all give it up for Satin Struthers. Clap.
Hey, Tammy, nice to see you.

874
01:10:27,652 --> 01:10:29,199
You ain't never looked better.

875
01:11:47,023 --> 01:11:49,867
- Columbia Records. May I help you?
- These girls, man.

876
01:12:10,672 --> 01:12:15,052
- What the hell is that on top of your head?
- The man said he wanted us dolled up.

877
01:12:15,218 --> 01:12:17,141
Plus, low maintenance
for medical school.

878
01:12:17,303 --> 01:12:20,398
I haven't gotten off the wait list,
but I think in the affirmative.

879
01:12:20,557 --> 01:12:23,686
No, not today, Dee.
Y'all supposed to look the same.

880
01:12:23,852 --> 01:12:26,321
- How I'm supposed to sell that?
- Better figure it out.

881
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:27,981
Sparkle, thank God you're here.

882
01:12:28,147 --> 01:12:30,149
- What? What's wrong?
- Look at her.

883
01:12:30,316 --> 01:12:32,159
Okay, I'll be right back.

884
01:12:32,318 --> 01:12:35,197
Stay here, look out for Sister.

885
01:12:35,822 --> 01:12:37,699
So, what do you think?

886
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:42,379
We were taught that if we don't have
anything nice to say to not say anything.

887
01:12:42,537 --> 01:12:45,086
- I want to hear it.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

888
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:46,500
- I'll be back.
- I'll come.

889
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,883
I'm going to the bathroom.

890
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,215
I'll watch you pee.
You're not gonna disown me.

891
01:13:03,182 --> 01:13:05,810
- Man, I told you not to bring her.
- I tried.

892
01:13:05,977 --> 01:13:07,900
- Not hard enough.
- Look, I'm sorry.

893
01:13:08,062 --> 01:13:10,861
- Just lock the door.
- What is going on in here?

894
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,203
What else is he pushing into you
besides his fists?

895
01:13:16,362 --> 01:13:18,911
Just mind your business. I'm fine.

896
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:20,663
I'm fine.

897
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:23,374
- So you just gonna let him kill you?
- It's not that bad.

898
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:26,585
It's nothing makeup can't cover up.

899
01:13:26,748 --> 01:13:29,752
- You get me that face powder I needed?
- Are you crazy?

900
01:13:29,918 --> 01:13:32,637
Give that to her and you're gonna
wind up looking like her.

901
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:35,765
Look, if you want me to sing for this man,
I need my makeup.

902
01:13:35,924 --> 01:13:38,347
I didn't know what to do.
She's sick with or without it.

903
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:40,261
Oh, please, Sparkle!

904
01:13:40,428 --> 01:13:43,056
All you're worried about
is getting that record deal.

905
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:46,567
You're not thinking about her.
You're busy using her like everybody else.

906
01:13:46,726 --> 01:13:49,650
- That's crazy. That's my sister, I love her.
- Then flush it.

907
01:13:49,812 --> 01:13:53,737
- Come on. Come on! Just give it to me.
- No, I'm not gonna let you kill yourself.

908
01:13:55,735 --> 01:13:57,112
What's going on?

909
01:13:57,278 --> 01:13:58,700
You tell me.

910
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:01,457
My receptionist says
your lead singer is beat up...

911
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:04,244
...and drugged up
in my damn utility closet.

912
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,004
No, Sister, she ain't here yet.

913
01:14:07,163 --> 01:14:08,415
We'll be out in a second.

914
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,083
Use your key.

915
01:14:17,548 --> 01:14:21,348
It's like I said.
I need to see them in the light of day.

916
01:14:55,169 --> 01:14:58,013
- Stix, baby, what's going on?
- I'm leaving.

917
01:14:59,757 --> 01:15:01,350
Baby, I want you to come with me.

918
01:15:02,301 --> 01:15:05,225
We can go down to the courthouse...

919
01:15:05,388 --> 01:15:07,811
...get married,
then leave if it makes it easier.

920
01:15:08,975 --> 01:15:11,979
I hope that wasn't your proposal,
I imagined something different.

921
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:16,400
Baby, we got to get out of here.
People are trying to destroy what we built.

922
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:17,863
You and me, we started this.

923
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:21,405
We'll put the group back together
when Sister gets well.

924
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:24,745
Sparkle, it's over.

925
01:15:26,909 --> 01:15:29,503
Baby, we got to start over,
and not here.

926
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:31,164
I mean, Detroit...

927
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,547
Detroit is dying.

928
01:15:32,707 --> 01:15:34,960
All these riots.

929
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:37,174
I even heard Motown
is moving to California.

930
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:38,883
You're talking about California?

931
01:15:39,047 --> 01:15:43,018
I'm talking about going anywhere where
we can live our dreams. Why not?

932
01:15:48,723 --> 01:15:50,100
I can't leave, Stix.

933
01:15:54,353 --> 01:15:55,775
Then you stay, then.

934
01:15:55,938 --> 01:15:59,738
Don't make me choose
between my family and you, Stix.

935
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:02,199
Baby, I'm not making you do anything.

936
01:16:03,362 --> 01:16:06,741
- Stix, don't leave me.
- Sparkle, I'm asking you to come with me.

937
01:16:08,785 --> 01:16:11,083
I'm asking you
to come with me as my wife.

938
01:16:13,164 --> 01:16:15,667
Baby, I need you to come with me.

939
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,050
You coming?

940
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,976
You know, your mama really
did a number on you, baby.

941
01:16:48,991 --> 01:16:52,495
Come on, Sparkle. She doesn't need
those dresses, she needs clothes.

942
01:16:52,662 --> 01:16:54,881
- I'm coming.
- Well, hurry up.

943
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:56,336
You two are funny.

944
01:16:56,499 --> 01:16:59,127
You can pack the bed if you want.
I'm not going anywhere.

945
01:16:59,293 --> 01:17:02,137
Oh, yes, you are. You awake?
You awake now?

946
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:04,048
- Get off me!
- Get up.

947
01:17:04,215 --> 01:17:06,968
- Get off me.
- Get up. Let's go.

948
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:09,763
- Want to be manhandled? Come on.
- Get off me.

949
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:11,272
Don't hurt her.

950
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,273
You didn't say anything
when she hit me.

951
01:17:13,432 --> 01:17:15,480
- No.
- What is wrong with you?

952
01:17:15,643 --> 01:17:19,273
Stop it. Stop, come on. Stop, guys.

953
01:17:26,028 --> 01:17:27,951
What's going on, baby?

954
01:17:32,869 --> 01:17:34,416
They call themselves saving me...

955
01:17:34,579 --> 01:17:38,300
...but I told them
I wasn't going anywhere.

956
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,633
Y'all need to get the hell
out of my house.

957
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:50,686
We're sorry we brought
chaos into your home...

958
01:17:50,845 --> 01:17:53,439
...but our sister is sick.
We just want her to get well.

959
01:17:53,598 --> 01:17:56,477
She's not listening to us,
but if you told her, she would go.

960
01:17:56,642 --> 01:17:59,065
Or for her to go, she--

961
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:00,320
You talk too damn much!

962
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:04,534
Learn to shut your mouth.

963
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:07,237
That's my sister!

964
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:08,871
Oh, y'all want some of this?

965
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:10,657
Y'all want some of this?

966
01:18:10,823 --> 01:18:12,575
Y'all want some of me?

967
01:18:12,742 --> 01:18:16,042
Shit! Get off me! Get off me!

968
01:18:16,204 --> 01:18:18,502
The hell's wrong with you?

969
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:23,302
Come on, you want it too?

970
01:18:25,213 --> 01:18:26,715
Little Miss Sparkle.

971
01:18:46,651 --> 01:18:49,780
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Is he dead?

972
01:18:56,452 --> 01:18:58,625
Give this to me.

973
01:18:58,788 --> 01:19:01,462
- You need to get out of here.
- Oh, my God.

974
01:19:01,624 --> 01:19:04,798
No. No. No.

975
01:19:05,795 --> 01:19:09,049
Come on, wake up. Please.

976
01:19:09,215 --> 01:19:12,640
Come on. One, two, three.

977
01:19:12,802 --> 01:19:15,931
One, two, three.

978
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:17,770
Please, wake, wake, wake.

979
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:24,526
Wake up.

980
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:26,691
Please, wake, wake, wake.

981
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:28,234
Wake up.

982
01:19:28,401 --> 01:19:30,699
- Please wake up.
- He's dead.

983
01:19:30,861 --> 01:19:33,831
- Sister, he's not dead.
- Look at me. He's dead.

984
01:19:35,324 --> 01:19:36,496
- He's dead.
- No!

985
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,377
- You have to go.
- No.

986
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:43,087
Mama was right. If I hadn't been scared
to sing, we would've never had a group.

987
01:19:43,249 --> 01:19:47,220
- He would've never went after you--
- I would love to hug you right now...

988
01:19:47,378 --> 01:19:50,973
...and tell you why this isn't your fault,
but I can't.

989
01:19:51,132 --> 01:19:52,509
You just have to go.

990
01:19:52,675 --> 01:19:54,928
Dee, you get out of here!

991
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:57,188
You take her with you! Go!

992
01:19:57,346 --> 01:19:59,815
Don't say anything to anyone.

993
01:19:59,974 --> 01:20:01,897
You were never here.

994
01:20:02,059 --> 01:20:03,936
- Go!
- Come on, come on.

995
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:05,821
We can't leave her here.

996
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:16,541
Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

997
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:18,747
Damn it!

998
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:28,632
On, baby.

999
01:20:28,794 --> 01:20:30,512
Baby.

1000
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:33,515
Baby, what did we do?

1001
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:37,144
On, baby.

1002
01:24:15,145 --> 01:24:16,237
Hallelujah!

1003
01:25:15,164 --> 01:25:18,259
- I love you.
- I love you.

1004
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:23,430
With all that's been going on...

1005
01:25:23,589 --> 01:25:26,468
...I couldn't find the right
time to tell you, Mama.

1006
01:25:28,135 --> 01:25:31,139
I got accepted into
Meharry Medical School.

1007
01:25:32,306 --> 01:25:34,183
Most of it is covered by scholarships...

1008
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,648
...but I have to go in early
to do some research.

1009
01:25:39,813 --> 01:25:44,740
Well, I guess the haircut worked, huh?

1010
01:25:45,277 --> 01:25:46,779
I guess it did.

1011
01:25:46,945 --> 01:25:51,951
Maybe I'll get one of them Afros
and bring some luck to myself.

1012
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:54,540
Congratulations.

1013
01:25:54,703 --> 01:25:56,751
Thank you.

1014
01:25:58,624 --> 01:26:00,718
Don't cry.

1015
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:02,128
We've done enough of that.

1016
01:26:03,462 --> 01:26:08,389
These are happy tears. It makes me feel
like I've done something right.

1017
01:26:10,552 --> 01:26:14,477
I used to complain
that you never let us do anything.

1018
01:26:16,058 --> 01:26:19,028
And I thank you for that kind of love.

1019
01:26:19,937 --> 01:26:22,031
And I'm sorry
for calling it something else.

1020
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:29,914
You'll never understand
how much your belief in me means.

1021
01:26:31,907 --> 01:26:32,999
I love you, Mama.

1022
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:35,536
Oh, Mommy loves you.

1023
01:26:35,703 --> 01:26:38,252
So proud of you.

1024
01:26:40,165 --> 01:26:41,633
My baby, the doctor.

1025
01:26:44,336 --> 01:26:46,213
Take care.

1026
01:27:06,692 --> 01:27:09,070
Hey, Spark, it's gonna be okay.

1027
01:27:09,236 --> 01:27:13,537
You know, two or three years
and I'll be out of here.

1028
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:15,701
- Dee left for school, right?
- Yeah.

1029
01:27:16,535 --> 01:27:18,003
That's good.

1030
01:27:19,455 --> 01:27:23,585
It's funny. We always said we'd have to
replace one singer in the group.

1031
01:27:23,751 --> 01:27:26,379
Now we have to replace two.

1032
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:28,422
I bet Stix is fit to be tied.

1033
01:27:33,594 --> 01:27:35,187
You two broke up?

1034
01:27:37,473 --> 01:27:38,975
Yeah.

1035
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,602
When did that happen?

1036
01:27:41,852 --> 01:27:44,401
The day we lost the record deal.

1037
01:27:48,066 --> 01:27:50,535
I'm so sorry, Spark.

1038
01:27:50,694 --> 01:27:52,571
It's okay.

1039
01:27:53,697 --> 01:27:56,246
Wasn't meant to be, I guess.

1040
01:28:01,288 --> 01:28:02,505
Don't come back here.

1041
01:28:03,248 --> 01:28:06,798
I'm the only one that comes to visit.
I'm not gonna leave you by yourself.

1042
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,086
I got in here by myself.

1043
01:28:08,253 --> 01:28:09,505
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

1044
01:28:09,671 --> 01:28:12,345
You think now's the time for me
to be lying to myself?

1045
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:14,931
Don't you think
I did enough of that already?

1046
01:28:15,677 --> 01:28:19,432
I'm not gonna let you
crawl up in here and die with me.

1047
01:28:22,893 --> 01:28:27,774
I hope you see
that I am trying to save your life.

1048
01:28:31,527 --> 01:28:33,780
Sister-- Tammy!

1049
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:03,605
- Mom--
- Sparkle, curl your hair. Get to bed.

1050
01:29:03,767 --> 01:29:06,065
Church in the morning.

1051
01:30:30,395 --> 01:30:31,897
Hi. How may I help you?

1052
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,987
I'm here to see Larry Robinson.

1053
01:30:34,149 --> 01:30:36,322
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

1054
01:30:36,485 --> 01:30:39,705
I'm sorry. You need an appointment.

1055
01:30:41,573 --> 01:30:43,416
Okay. I'll wait.

1056
01:31:15,023 --> 01:31:17,321
Mr. Robinson will see you now.

1057
01:31:35,002 --> 01:31:38,597
Okay, we're just going to have to admit
we're wasting a lot of money.

1058
01:31:42,134 --> 01:31:45,855
We'll salvage what we can salvage,
make jambalaya out of the rest.

1059
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:50,226
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

1060
01:31:51,351 --> 01:31:53,353
I have two minutes. Go.

1061
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,115
Well, let me not waste them
on why I need you.

1062
01:31:57,274 --> 01:31:58,321
That's obvious.

1063
01:31:58,483 --> 01:32:00,451
Let me tell you why you need me.

1064
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:03,413
That's a big setup.
I hope you can deliver.

1065
01:32:03,572 --> 01:32:07,668
I'm beautiful, I can sing, and I write hits,
sometimes two and three a day.

1066
01:32:07,826 --> 01:32:10,454
I've been kissed, 20 about that alone.

1067
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,997
I've been in love, 22.

1068
01:32:12,164 --> 01:32:14,007
My heart's been broken, 30.

1069
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:17,136
I'm a virgin, so I have 80
on what making love will be like.

1070
01:32:17,669 --> 01:32:19,922
I have a complicated relationship
with my mother.

1071
01:32:20,088 --> 01:32:22,841
I don't know my daddy,
tack on another 50.

1072
01:32:23,008 --> 01:32:26,763
War sucks, flowers are pretty in the rain,
and it's hard to follow your dreams...

1073
01:32:26,928 --> 01:32:30,523
...but you have to, because you might
write a song that saves someone's life.

1074
01:32:30,682 --> 01:32:33,936
I have a great song about that
because I'm trying to save my own.

1075
01:32:35,812 --> 01:32:39,567
So can we do business?

1076
01:33:03,715 --> 01:33:05,058
Hi.

1077
01:33:06,009 --> 01:33:07,556
I saw Larry Robinson today.

1078
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:11,394
He said he'd love to come and see
my show, but I don't have a show.

1079
01:33:11,556 --> 01:33:13,024
Figured I ought to get one.

1080
01:33:14,643 --> 01:33:16,270
We only have one shot at this.

1081
01:33:19,606 --> 01:33:21,358
Better make it count.

1082
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,792
I'm glad I didn't leave.

1083
01:33:45,632 --> 01:33:48,977
- Hi, Mama.
- Hi.

1084
01:33:50,804 --> 01:33:52,681
May I come in?

1085
01:34:11,616 --> 01:34:13,584
Hey, Sparkle.
How you doing, baby?

1086
01:34:13,743 --> 01:34:15,120
You look good.

1087
01:34:15,287 --> 01:34:17,506
Little skinny, but good.

1088
01:34:17,664 --> 01:34:19,132
So how's the new job?

1089
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:21,840
It's great. How are you doing?

1090
01:34:22,002 --> 01:34:24,255
Oh, I'm good. Always good, baby.

1091
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:34,140
I have a flyer for my show.

1092
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,614
It's my own concert.

1093
01:34:46,776 --> 01:34:49,996
I'm not opening up for anybody,
just me.

1094
01:34:52,407 --> 01:34:54,250
I would really love it if you'd come.

1095
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:05,504
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

1096
01:35:12,427 --> 01:35:15,931
How many times you gonna keep
making the same mistake, Emma?

1097
01:35:24,981 --> 01:35:27,951
You know the bit, right?
Let's hear it one more time.

1098
01:35:31,196 --> 01:35:33,119
You like it?

1099
01:35:33,281 --> 01:35:34,783
- Okay.
- Okay, ladies.

1100
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:37,169
Go home and get some rest.
Seven p.m. sharp.

1101
01:35:37,327 --> 01:35:38,374
- Yes, boss.
- Thank you.

1102
01:35:38,536 --> 01:35:39,708
- Bye, Sparkle.
- See you.

1103
01:35:39,871 --> 01:35:42,169
- Happy birthday. Love you.
- Yeah. Happy birthday.

1104
01:35:42,332 --> 01:35:44,209
Thank you.

1105
01:35:44,376 --> 01:35:48,256
Yes, okay, guys. Tomorrow, 6:00.

1106
01:35:50,674 --> 01:35:53,518
How you feeling? Good?

1107
01:35:53,677 --> 01:35:55,896
We can't do this, Stix.

1108
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,769
You know, we gonna be fine.

1109
01:36:01,935 --> 01:36:04,814
- You gonna be fine.
- What if I'm not?

1110
01:36:06,648 --> 01:36:08,025
Well, close your eyes.

1111
01:36:08,191 --> 01:36:11,661
Stix, I'm not trying to be dramatic.
I'm trying to be serious.

1112
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,573
Sparkle, close your eyes.

1113
01:36:18,910 --> 01:36:19,957
Now sing.

1114
01:38:03,473 --> 01:38:05,521
Make a wish, baby.

1115
01:38:10,271 --> 01:38:11,614
Ask me what I wished for.

1116
01:38:13,525 --> 01:38:14,697
What'd you wish for?

1117
01:38:16,361 --> 01:38:18,864
That you would ask me
to marry you again...

1118
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:22,000
...but better, and with a ring.

1119
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:24,536
- Did you peek?
- What?

1120
01:38:28,164 --> 01:38:29,916
That's your gift.

1121
01:38:37,257 --> 01:38:41,182
And tomorrow, our lives are going
to change, for better or for worse.

1122
01:38:42,345 --> 01:38:44,018
Whatever it is...

1123
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,023
...I just want to be with you.

1124
01:38:47,559 --> 01:38:51,234
Now, of course, if it's better,
you get a better ring.

1125
01:38:51,396 --> 01:38:55,697
And if it's worse, then that ring is going
to be dinner for the next few nights.

1126
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:00,288
See, even you're not so sure.

1127
01:39:16,421 --> 01:39:18,219
I'm sure.

1128
01:39:19,466 --> 01:39:21,343
And I love you.

1129
01:39:21,885 --> 01:39:24,638
And I'm going to be standing
right over there in them wings.

1130
01:39:29,642 --> 01:39:31,189
I love you too.

1131
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:50,998
You got five minutes.

1132
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,687
You look tired.

1133
01:40:18,775 --> 01:40:20,527
I am.

1134
01:40:24,072 --> 01:40:25,665
Yeah.

1135
01:40:27,492 --> 01:40:29,335
Me too.

1136
01:40:31,246 --> 01:40:34,170
Well, what do you think?

1137
01:40:35,208 --> 01:40:36,585
Oh, my gosh!

1138
01:40:36,751 --> 01:40:38,674
Oh, you're bleeding.

1139
01:40:38,836 --> 01:40:40,634
- What?
- Oh, no.

1140
01:40:40,797 --> 01:40:42,094
- My dress!
- No, no, no.

1141
01:40:42,257 --> 01:40:44,601
- Look at it, it's ruined.
- Okay, just hold.

1142
01:40:44,759 --> 01:40:46,602
- Look at my dress. It's ruined.
- I know.

1143
01:40:46,761 --> 01:40:49,810
Okay, just breathe, please.
We'll stop the bleeding.

1144
01:40:49,973 --> 01:40:51,316
I know, I know, I know.

1145
01:40:51,474 --> 01:40:53,351
Well, maybe you can wear this one.

1146
01:40:54,185 --> 01:40:56,279
Let's see.

1147
01:40:56,437 --> 01:40:57,734
Mama?

1148
01:40:57,897 --> 01:40:58,989
Hey, baby.

1149
01:40:59,148 --> 01:41:00,821
- Emma.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1150
01:41:03,027 --> 01:41:05,496
You guys, come on.

1151
01:41:06,698 --> 01:41:08,075
It's okay.

1152
01:41:12,203 --> 01:41:14,752
I don't want to get all mushy, okay?

1153
01:41:15,498 --> 01:41:16,545
Okay.

1154
01:41:17,292 --> 01:41:20,171
I just came to help
my baby get dressed.

1155
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:25,551
Well, like Dolores said,
lean back and pinch, okay?

1156
01:41:25,717 --> 01:41:28,721
Just try it. Let's see. Okay.
Let's just count.

1157
01:41:28,886 --> 01:41:33,767
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

1158
01:41:37,103 --> 01:41:38,150
Fantastic turnout.

1159
01:41:39,522 --> 01:41:41,195
- I hope you are proud.
- I love this.

1160
01:41:41,357 --> 01:41:42,404
And you mean to say...

1161
01:41:42,567 --> 01:41:45,446
...that just you and your friends
and neighbors sold tickets?

1162
01:41:45,612 --> 01:41:47,034
Yes, sir, and I told you too.

1163
01:41:47,196 --> 01:41:49,244
- Yeah, you told me.
- I told you.

1164
01:41:51,951 --> 01:41:53,294
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:41:54,746 --> 01:41:56,714
You look beautiful.

1166
01:41:56,873 --> 01:41:59,877
You don't think it's too much,
or not enough?

1167
01:42:00,043 --> 01:42:03,923
If you're gonna go out there, you gotta
give them something they can feel.

1168
01:42:04,088 --> 01:42:06,090
Or at least imagine feeling.

1169
01:42:07,133 --> 01:42:13,015
Plus, Sister said make it sexy
so you can't run or hide.

1170
01:42:14,098 --> 01:42:15,190
You went to see her.

1171
01:42:17,477 --> 01:42:18,524
What's wrong?

1172
01:42:18,686 --> 01:42:20,233
Oh, nothing.

1173
01:42:21,397 --> 01:42:24,241
I always knew you had the gift.

1174
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,450
Not just in singing,
but you believe in yourself...

1175
01:42:29,072 --> 01:42:32,042
...even when I tried to stop you
at every turn.

1176
01:42:32,784 --> 01:42:35,537
Takes a lot of faith to do that, Sparkle.

1177
01:42:36,704 --> 01:42:38,377
Thank you.

1178
01:42:38,539 --> 01:42:40,541
Don't lose it.

1179
01:42:41,209 --> 01:42:43,553
Some of us are still trying to find it.

1180
01:42:44,712 --> 01:42:45,759
Promise.

1181
01:42:49,008 --> 01:42:50,134
You're staying, right?

1182
01:42:50,802 --> 01:42:53,931
But of course.
I didn't get dressed for my health.

1183
01:42:55,598 --> 01:42:58,522
And I'll sit far enough in the back
so I don't upstage you.

1184
01:43:03,147 --> 01:43:04,319
You look great.

1185
01:43:04,482 --> 01:43:06,826
- I love you.
