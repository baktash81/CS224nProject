00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:52,461
And never get in a van.

177
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,856
I made that mistake once.

178
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,815
( man whistles )

179
00:07:57,815 --> 00:07:59,574
Just once.

180
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:02,050
It happened downtowna couple of years ago.

181
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,726
It was before I had a pimpto take care of me.

182
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:10,441
I guess my mind just wasn'ton my job that night.

183
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,713
Man: Excuse me, miss.

184
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,461
You're a prostitute,aren't you?

185
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,898
No. I'm a wet dreamon legs.

186
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:37,291
How-- how muchdo you cost?

187
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,048
What are you looking for?

188
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:44,244
I don't know.Something around $20.

189
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,798
20 bucks won't buya porno tape.

190
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:51,156
Double itand I'll give you head.

191
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,675
I give great head.

192
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,542
All right. All right.Get in.

193
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,693
So you got a placeor you want it here?

194
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:16,409
- ( screaming )- Yeah!

195
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:19,086
Come on, man!Give her a good fucking for me!

196
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:21,163
Fuck her up the ass! Yeah!

197
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,241
Come on, man!Do it for me, man!

198
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:26,998
Stick it down herfucking throat, man! Whoo!

199
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,234
Liz: There must have been five of 'em.

200
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,792
They started on me right away. They were like animals.

201
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,230
Just grunting and laughing. Grunting and cussing.

202
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,948
- Yeah, come on, man!- ( screaming continues )

203
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:38,106
Liz: Seem to go on forever. I don't know how long.

204
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:41,621
When they had enough, they-- they just got rid of me.

205
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,739
- Man: Later, bitch! - ( door shuts )

206
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,896
( whimpering )

207
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:26,412
My God.

208
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,526
Don't be afraid.

209
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:44,633
Liz: Yeah, he offered me a ride to the nearest hospital.

210
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,230
I really should've gone,

211
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,947
but the hospital would've called the cops

212
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:52,344
and I couldn't deal with the cops.

213
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,741
So I told him I had a fight with my boyfriend

214
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,539
and maybe he could just take me home.

215
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,015
Then he told me he was a schoolteacher.

216
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:02,893
Great, with my luck, he'll molest me.

217
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:05,249
He gave me his handkerchief to wipe away the blood.

218
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,408
The only thing he wanted

219
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:10,085
was to know if I needed anything.

220
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,482
I hated asking,

221
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:14,760
but I needed some money.

222
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,517
He gave me 20 bucks, his name, and his address.

223
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:19,914
I guess he thought he'd never see it again,

224
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:22,271
but I sent it back with a new handkerchief

225
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,349
and I wrote him this little thank-you note.

226
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:27,186
"Just a line to let you know that I'm okay."

227
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,864
But he never wrote back.

228
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:33,301
One look at my spelling would scare anybody off.

229
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,416
Especially a schoolteacher, you know?

230
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,692
( air rhythmically rushing )

231
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:49,361
Looks a little flat.

232
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,199
Need a hand pumping it up?

233
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,796
You are doing it

234
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,436
without a rubber thing?

235
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,592
I pay for itwithout a rubber thing.

236
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,031
You prefer whatwithout a rubber thing?

237
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:03,226
- Everything.- What are you, man,like suicidal?

238
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:05,344
Yes. I amliking that, too.

239
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:08,341
Well, I'm not intosuicides and I always usea rubber thing.

240
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:11,098
- I pay extra.- You couldn't afford extra.

241
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,215
( siren blaring )

242
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,126
He wants it,but he doesn't wantto use a rubber.

243
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:24,524
Get a lot of men like that.

244
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,439
I mean, they'll pay extra.Sometimes even double.

245
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,876
I mean,that is really stupid.

246
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,674
What if they tooksomething home to their wives?

247
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,949
Some of 'em never give up, do they?

248
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,867
Take Charlie for instance.

249
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,665
Man was as good as gold.

250
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:44,822
Charlie was a regular, but he didn't want sex.

251
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:46,979
Well, not straight sex anyway.

252
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,616
All I had to do was hit him with his cane and he'd come.

253
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:51,973
First time, I got a little carried away.

254
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,771
Bam. Oops.

255
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:56,169
Then I found out just how hard he liked it.

256
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:59,405
It's funny. The first time I saw him all stretched out on the bed

257
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:02,642
with his skinny little chicken legs and his wrinkled little butt,

258
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:05,439
I mean, I practically peed my pants.

259
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,756
Just six swats. That was all he needed.

260
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,594
Easy money.

261
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:11,392
I must have a talent for it.

262
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,229
I should open up a torture chamber.

263
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,348
I make him beg for mercy.

264
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:16,827
There was this one day, right,

265
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:18,305
his grandchildren were there.

266
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:20,182
He told them I was from the welfare department.

267
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,940
That he had to show me around the house.

268
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,339
We left the kids watching TV and we went upstairs.

269
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,175
We couldn't do it in the bedroom 'cause the lock was broke.

270
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,013
So we did it in the bathroom,

271
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:31,610
but I couldn't get a good swing.

272
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,129
It was just too narrow.

273
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,486
- ( glass shatters ) - ( Liz laughs )

274
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:37,764
I broke a fucking light fixture.

275
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,879
He was so sweet. He always gave me something.

276
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,557
I mean, you know, besides the money.

277
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,514
Usually something from the garden.

278
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:50,031
I know it's stupid to get involved with tricks,

279
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,669
but he's, well, he's a client.

280
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,826
And sometimes, you've gotta break the rules.

281
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:56,823
Last year, Charlie had a stroke.

282
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,618
Give me your hands,Donatello.

283
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:07,930

284
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,006

286
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,958
Okay, so he's in a rest home now.

287
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,877
Don't mean he has to rest.

288
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,674
Charlie's still my client.

289
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,151
I always bring him an avocado.

290
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:27,030
He thinks it's from his garden.

291
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,948
Hey, what he don't know won't hurt him.

292
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:32,184
But I think he probably knows.

00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,195
- Mosquito.- What do you want now,a dollar for slapping me?

300
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:01,193
No, no problem.

301
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,470
- No problem, sister.- Thanks, mon,

302
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,508
but next time,I think I'll justlet him suck my blood.

303
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:08,065
But it was free.( laughs )

304
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:09,983
- Free.- Shit.

305
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:15,936
( horn honks )

306
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,532
Whoo!

307
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,685
Bad move.

308
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:29,202
Even tricks need a little bitof mystery, AIDS carrier.

309
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:31,360
She's a fucking strawberry.

310
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,476
Won't accept cash,only crack.

311
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,794
And you see,prostitutes like that,

312
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:38,592
they have no respectfor themselves.

313
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:41,948
I mean, I would never pull outone of my breasts in public.

314
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,143
I would never go outwith a bodysuit on.

315
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:48,182
I mean, just a bodysuit.

316
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,937
And I would neveropen my legs on the street.

317
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:54,175
I mean, I would never donone of that shit.

318
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:58,169
And I don'twear shorts, either.

319
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,367
Well, I wear shorts,

320
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,404
but I don't wear themup the crack of my ass,you know?

321
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,483
And I only wear 'emduring the day.

322
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,480
I mean,when I was younger,

323
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,356
I used to do shit like that,I guess. I don't know.

324
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:15,032
Seems the older I get,the more mature I get, I guess.

325
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:22,143
Goddamnmotherfucking shit.

326
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:27,498
- ( tires screech )- ( horn honks )

327
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,755
( tires screech )

328
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:17,004
( music playing )

329
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,594
Give me a dry martini,please.

330
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,673
Very dry with a cherry.

331
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,270
Not an olive.

332
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,349
( panting )

333
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,105
He doesn't really thinkI'm gonna leave him.

334
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,222
Hey, I know what he thinks.

335
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,300
He thinks I'm stillgonna work.

336
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,656
Like I said,I left my place yesterday,

337
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,254
I went and got thislittle motel room.

338
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:47,650
And see,what he thinks is

339
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,568
is that I've beenstacking my money, right?

340
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,968
And in a couple of days,

341
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:53,244
I'm gonna have thisbig bankroll for him.

342
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,883
( scoffs )

343
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:57,121
That's what he thinks,but I'm not.

344
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,078
No. Not this time.

345
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:02,474
I've been spending my money.

346
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,222
Oh.

347
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:16,220
Look at my nails.

348
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,177
I used to havebeautiful nails.

349
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:22,533
Now I can't leave them alone.

350
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,090
I'm like a dog with a bone.

351
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,366
See, pimps, you know,

352
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:33,081
they think that they gotthis hold on you, you know?

353
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:35,919
Like you'll stick to themlike fucking crazy glue.

354
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:40,673
And it is kinda crazy,you know?

355
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:43,670
In some sort of sick,twisted way, they...

356
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,065
they make you believethat you love 'em.

357
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,652
I knew Blake about a year

358
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:02,489
and he never asked me out or even laid a hand on me.

359
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,287
It wasn't that I wanted him to.

360
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,124
It was that I wondered why he hadn't.

361
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:08,403
So naturally, when he sent me a classy dress

362
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:10,200
and showed up at my place in a tux

363
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,839
with pine freshener on his breath,

364
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,076
I wondered what the fuck was up.

365
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:16,475
Um, hey.

366
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:18,472
Do you think we could sitat a different table?

367
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:20,469
I mean, I got thisproblem with kitchens.

368
00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:22,746
I used to work at thisgreasy spoon, you know,

369
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,545
and it was justcrawling with roaches.

370
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,542
Ahem. Well,it's your night.

371
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,818
I understand, ma'am.Please, follow me.

372
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,215
Oh, but I didn't mean

373
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,893
your kitchen was crawlingwith roaches, too.

374
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:37,171
It's just that I get this,what do you call it?

375
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:40,049
A phobia about it.Yeah, that's it.

376
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:46,720
Liz: I felt kinda nervous.

377
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,598
You know, like you do when you're out with your boss or something.

378
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:51,396
I didn't think I could be promoted

379
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,594
and I wondered if a whore could be fired.

380
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,431
But then he never would've used breath freshener

381
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:58,108
and bought me that classy new dress, would he?

382
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:02,943
So now you gonna tell mewhat the occasion is?

383
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,379
So what do you want to eat?

384
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,416
( sighs )

385
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,332
A steak.I'm so hungry,I could eat a horse.

386
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:14,890
10-1 it is one, huh?

387
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,848
Steak "tarter."

388
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,966
Yeah, this is a nice place,

389
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:21,243
but you'd think they'd knowhow to spell steak, huh?

390
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:23,960
- S-T-E-K-E--- This is a French restaurant.

391
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:28,755
Then how come there's noFrench fries on the menu, huh?

392
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,192
They call 'em pommes frites.

393
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,228
Oh.

394
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:36,986
Well, I'll havea helping of that

395
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,304
and a nice, juicy steak.

396
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,501
Steak tartareis raw steak

397
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,499
minced withraw onions, eggs,

398
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:46,056
and Worcestershire sauce.

399
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:50,452
Oh. Really?

400
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:53,727
Well, why don't you makea suggestion, then, huh?

401
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:55,485
All right.

402
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,602
As a starter,how 'bout gravlax marinade?

403
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,359
What's that?

404
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,796
It's raw salmonand it's marinade--

405
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,192
Raw?Is everything inthis restaurant raw?

406
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,311
I mean, can't they afforda chef around here?

407
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,307
Hey, raw foodis really good for you.Don't you know nothin'?

408
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,426
( speaks French )

409
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:17,102
He wants youto choose.

410
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:19,140
( laughs )

411
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,859
What, you foundsomething?

412
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,415
What's so funny aboutcrab julienne?

413
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,613
You remember.Your old whore Julienne.

414
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,610
She had crabslike you wouldn't believe.

415
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,649
- You remember.- Uh, yes, madam?

416
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:34,203
- I don't really know, sir.- Hey, call him waiter.

417
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:36,761
You call me sir.

418
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,559
I'll orderfor both of us.

419
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,196
Très bien, sir.

420
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:43,593
We'll have the calamara la chinoise.

421
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,391
And would sir care for some wine?

422
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,789
Hey, can we getsome champagne?

423
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:50,906
I haven't had champagnefor a long time.

424
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:54,781
Give me a bottleof "Low Da Vici."Very cold.

425
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:59,256
I presume sir means "Eau De Vichy."

426
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:00,615
Yeah, that's what I said.

427
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:04,851
So now you gonna tell mewhat this is all about?

428
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:11,923
Madamhas a request?

429
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,721
I have an extensiverepertoire.

430
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:16,597
Uh, how 'bout "Don't ItMake My Brown Eyes Blue"?

431
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:19,474
I'm afraidI'm not that familiar withthe contemporary classics.

432
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:22,271
- Of course not.- How 'bout the marchfrom act three

433
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,949
of Wagner's"Lohengrin"?

434
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,787
I think you meanact two.

435
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:39,373
I was wondering when wewere gonna get together,

436
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:43,448
- but is this likea proposal or something?- "Something," my ass.

437
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:45,246
Don't say you didn'tremember our anniversary.

438
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,844
I've been lookingafter you a year now.

439
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:48,203
A year this very day.

440
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:50,360
- C'est bon, sir?- You may pour.

441
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:06,183
- To our anniversary.- And the oldest profession.

442
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:08,900
- The what?- Ahem.

443
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,818
Uh, prostitution

444
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,815
is commonly knownas the oldest profession.

445
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:16,452
It sure makes me feel old.I'll drink to that.

446
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,767
This tastesexactly like water.

447
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,124
It's sparkling mineral water. It's good for the liver.

448
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:25,842
You oughta lay off the booze.It's got a lot of calories.

449
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:27,160
- No, put it out.- Hmm?

450
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,078
We're in a nonsmoking area.Put it out.

451
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,996
Well, why don't we moveto a smoking area, then?

452
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:33,393
You wanna take care of yourself?Smoking is bad for your health.

453
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:35,311
So is fuckingscabby tricks.

454
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:38,188
And what is this?

455
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,905
It's calamari and lychees.What's it look like?

456
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,462
I don't know,but I've seen onebefore, I think.

457
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,899
What is calamar?

458
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,216
It's a kind of octopus,you stupid moron.

459
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:50,815
It's fucking octopus.

460
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:53,292
Ha! I should've known.They got testicles, don't they?

461
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:56,288
Though I thought theyhad eight of 'em. Looks likeyou've been shortchanged.

462
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,005
Looks like a dick.

463
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,357
( spits )Tastes like a dick.

464
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,594
Look, all I want is just

465
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:11,952
an old-fashioned pieceof apple pie with loadsof ice cream on it!

466
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,750
- Yeah, well, forget it!- What-- what you say?!

467
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,307
What, have you gone deaf?I said forget it!

468
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:16,945
You're as fatas a fucking pig!

469
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,904
( scoffs )

470
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:22,381
I'm-- I am?

471
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:25,177
Liz: I guess he was right.

472
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:28,254
I smoke too much, eat junk food, and drink like a fish.

473
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:31,011
I mean, I gotta get some satisfaction out of life

474
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,968
or it just ain't worth living.

475
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:35,965
Whoring ain't exactly the job of the future, you know.

476
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,843
And working out, doing 50 sit-ups

477
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,440
when I could have been sleeping wasn't my idea of fun.

478
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,516
Well, it had its moments, I guess.

479
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:48,153
♪ Tell me ♪

480
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,908
♪ Tell me all your secrets ♪

481
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,784
♪ Tell me all your secrets ♪

482
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,101
♪ Tell me. ♪

483
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,569
- ( buzzing )- ( Liz groaning )

484
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:13,764
Our first year together as pimp and whore

485
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,881
and Blake's idea of an anniversary gift...

486
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,638
You're gonna seea big change in yourself.

487
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:22,074
Psychologically.

488
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,033
Physically,

489
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,230
you're gonna bea lot more body conscious.

490
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,548
Great. Does that meanI'm gonna lose my stomach?

491
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:32,184
Tattoo artist: You'll be a lot more committed to self.

492
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:34,821
And to the one you love,

493
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:38,018
you'll have a special,spiritual connection

494
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:39,896
because tattoos are forever.

495
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:42,412
So are diamonds,but they're a lot less painful.

496
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,527
That's the most pricksI've had in 30 minutes.

497
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:51,962
Liz: For a while, he was right.

498
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:53,919
I felt kinda special.

499
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,397
Till one by one I found out

500
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:58,594
all of Blake's girls had one.

501
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:01,392
Hey, not always on the same body part.

502
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,309
I wasn't special.

503
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:06,825
I was just a piece of branded cattle. One of the herd.

504
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:08,904
You see, what pimps do

505
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:12,100
is they build you up and then they break you down.

506
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:15,296
It's kinda likebeing a hostage.

507
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:18,333
They just know howto make you need 'em.

508
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:21,729
They don't love you.

509
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:23,527
Pimps don't love nobody.

510
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:26,324
Give me another martini,please.

511
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,761
Air dry.

512
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,117
Getting as bad as Bill was.

513
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:34,556
Fuck it.

514
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:39,150
The minute I laid eyes on him,

515
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,149
I thought he was real cute.

516
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,665
It was back home at the local dive

517
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:45,344
where they had music and beer

518
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,661
and you could hang out and shoot pool.

519
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:49,859
Like I did with my friend Martha.

520
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,537
It was back in the days when I was living the straight life.

521
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,934
- I feel like I'm gonna die.- Put your bet on him.

522
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:57,691
- Think I should?- What's a buck?Yeah, you're right.

523
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,609
But don't you thinkit will look kinda weird,me going over there

524
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,526
and putting money downright in front of him?

525
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:03,284
No, he'll just thinkyou're some horny bar slut

526
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:06,321
- that wants to fuck him.- Stop.

527
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:08,039
What if I wantto marry him?

528
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,237
Then I thinkI better bet on him.

This is for you.

540
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,966
- Congratulations.- Oh, it was nothing.

541
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:16,205
- No, it was, really.- You think so?

542
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:19,440
Yeah. Hey, you shouldn't putyour talents down, you know?

543
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,157
It's an inherited talent.My old man's a big drinker.

544
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:26,075
- Really? So is mine.- No kidding?

545
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:29,829
Yeah, well, that's whatmy mom told me anyway.

You wanna danceor something?

547
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,503
- Okay.- All right.

548
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:38,820
Here, you can havethis prize.

549
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,498
Oh, gee, thanks.

550
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,450
Liz: For a while, it was great.

551
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,608
We really loved each other.

552
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,727
The way when you're a little girl

553
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:54,283
and imagine how love would feel.

554
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,721
The way your mom always told you love should be.

555
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,877
So I thought getting married

556
00:28:58,877 --> 00:29:01,036
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

557
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:04,952
I guess it was too good to last.

558
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:08,029
Well, that was one thing my mom didn't tell me.

Liz: Well, I guess playing house

563
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,728
is sorta fun when you're seven years old.

564
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:27,887
But when you're seven months pregnant, well, forget it.

565
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:30,763
I mean, when he starts getting home later and later,

566
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:33,800
drunker and drunker 'cause of all the overtime he's putting in,

567
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,635
when you know he's been fired and he's been cheating on you.

568
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:40,713
Well, that'd be tough on any relationship.

569
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:43,710
Still, I couldn't stop loving the bastard.

570
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,827
So I kept on trying to please him.

571
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,623
Getting all dolled up for dinner and setting the table pretty

572
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,302
and making his favorite salad.

573
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:52,739
All I really wanted was a good night's sleep.

574
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:55,656
And you never knew how he was gonna react.

575
00:29:55,656 --> 00:29:58,653
It was like living on the edge of a fucking volcano.

576
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:04,567
( crying )

577
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,033
( baby crying )

578
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,549
Shut up.

579
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,706
Chrissy.

580
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,624
Shh. Come on, baby.

581
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:26,663
We're gonna go see Grandma.

582
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:28,541
Let's get out of this dump.

583
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,459
Woman on TV:I want my daughter.

584
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,335
I'm not an alcoholic.Give me Karen.

585
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:35,052
Man on TV:Take it off, then.

586
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:38,330
Woman: Give memy daughter, please.

587
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,367
Man: Yeah, this iswhat you want.

588
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,845
- No.- This is what it's about,huh, Bambi?

589
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:45,681
I want my daughter.

590
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:47,599
Liz: Finally, I get it through my head.

591
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,758
Okay, I married a loser. No great loss.

592
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:51,556
A lot of people do it.

593
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,992
So I leave Bill and I move in with my mom.

594
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:57,389
Then I get this dream job at a sleazy diner.

595
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,865
One night it was late, I was tired, and the tips were shit.

596
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:04,181
I just worked a double shift when this guy walks in.

597
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,738
It was like he walked into the wrong restaurant.

598
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:08,977
What's onthe menu tonight?

599
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:12,252
Chef Pierre is goneand we're closingin five minutes.

600
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:15,049
I can offer you a pieceof cantaloupe, though.

601
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:17,007
- How's your cantaloupe?- Ripe.

602
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:18,965
Is that what you wanted?

603
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,283
- How 'bout a drink instead?- Sorry, we don't serve--

604
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:23,480
What do you say I take yousomewhere that does?

605
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,678
What, me?You mean...

606
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:28,555
I'm not muchof a drinker.

607
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:32,831
In fact, I'm nota big drinker at all.

608
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,186
Sorry.

609
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,346
Keep the change.

610
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:39,663
- Thanks.- I'm a big tipper.

611
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,857
I have to go home.I got a--

612
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:46,015
You have a what?

613
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:49,092
A cat. I have a catI got to feed, but...

614
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:55,444
But I think I might havealready fed him.

615
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,083
( laughs )

616
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,921
Liz: I would have gone out with him anyway.

617
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:02,317
It was more money than I made in a whole week.

618
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:04,875
I thought, "Who cares? What do I have to lose?"

619
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:08,630
I'll just lock up.It'll only be a minute.

620
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:17,022
Liz: Doing it for money--

621
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,861
it's like losing your virginity.

622
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:21,737

And I knew my little boywas safe with her.

639
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,518
It was a real nicearrangement.

640
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:17,755
Till she wentand died on me.

641
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:25,466
Sometimes I wish I was dead.

642
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:27,785
But I'm not brave enoughto do it myself.

643

Hell couldn't be any worsethan this now, could it?

652
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:16,865
The big tease.

653
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,902
They love it and they thinkyou love it, too.

654
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:22,459

655
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,376
( lowered )"Talk to me," they'd say.

656
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:27,774
I know what they mean now,but at first I didn't.

657
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:30,091
"What do you want meto talk about," I'd say.

658
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,129
( lowered )"What do you like doing?"

659
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,446
I don't know.I like watching TV.

660
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:37,123
( lowered )"No, not that.What am I doing to you?"

661
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:38,881
"What you doing to me?"

662
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,678
( lowered )"Yeah. Tell me, tell me.What am I doing to you?"

663
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:45,394
I was still young.

664
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,592
I didn't know whatthey wanted me to say.

665
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:49,630
Now when they ask,

666
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,388
I know what they want.

667
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:54,544
As soon as theyget their dick outand ask me if I like it.

668
00:35:54,544 --> 00:35:56,141
I whisper to them,

669
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,739
"Oh, honey,it's a beautiful cock.

670
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,697
It's so big and hard."

671
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:04,054
( lowered )"What do you want meto do with it," they'd say.

672
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,451
I'd love toreally tell 'em.

673
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:07,890
But instead, I say,

674
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,727
"Oh, my pussy'sreally hungry

675
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:11,485
for your big,hard cock.

676
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:14,203
Come on, give it to me.Give it to me."

677
00:36:15,561 --> 00:36:16,880
Yeah.

678
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:21,834
But then thereare those who want to dothe talking themselves.

679
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:25,391
I mean, talk dirty.

680
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,388
Sometimes it feels like they just--

681
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,347
they just want to rip you open.

682
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:31,984
Hey, be a littlegentle, huh?

683
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,782
Shut your fucking trap.

684
00:36:33,782 --> 00:36:35,899
Liz: So I just shut up and let 'em do their thing.

685
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,458
I close my eyes.

686
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,495
I don't want to see the hate in their faces.

687
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,449
They must haveterrible lives.

688
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,446
The men, I mean.

689
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:50,962
Something must have happenedto 'em to make 'em like that.

690
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:53,160
They weren't born that way,were they?

691
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:58,474
Maybe they'rehenpecked at home.

692
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:02,910
Or bossed around at work

693
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,106
so they feel humiliated.

694
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,464
They want to humiliatesomebody back.

695
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:10,741
Makes 'em feel better.

696
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,737
More important.

697
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:16,055
It's nothing personal.

698
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:17,813
I know that.

699
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:21,689
They don't even want sex,you know.

700
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,967
It's more like...

701
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,283
like revenge.

702
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:30,360
Yeah.

703
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,517
That's it.

704
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,953
They only want revenge.

705
00:37:41,227 --> 00:37:42,626
( water running )

706
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,055
( man moaning )

707
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:57,491
I feel sorryfor their wives.

708
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:01,246
Most of the menwho come in heremust be married.

709
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,244
And they come here

710
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:04,842
because we'll dothe things

711
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:06,920
their wivesand girlfriendswon't do.

712
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,395
Head. That's whatmost of 'em ask for.

713
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:13,552
I mean,I don't see why

714
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:14,991
a woman would havea problem

715
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:17,308
with stickingher man's cockin her mouth?

716
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,506
I mean,I guarantee you

717
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,544
if he ain't sticking itin her mouth,

718
00:38:21,544 --> 00:38:24,182
he'll be sticking itin somebody else's.

719
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:26,458
Could be hers,could be mine.

720
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,496
We're substitutes.

721
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:30,254
I bet you

722
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,853
he's got his eyes shut

723
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,210
thinking of his wife right now.

724
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,647
( moaning continues )

725
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,685
Me?

726
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:42,442
I don't wanna see another dickas long as I live.

727
00:38:42,442 --> 00:38:44,917
Ugh.

728
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,356
( sighs )

729
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:48,834
I've lost countof how many I've had.

730
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:50,712
Must be miles.

731
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:52,669
( moaning continues )

732
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,625
I used to love sex.

733
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,020
I used to loveeverything about it.

734
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,857
Now when I go to bed,

735
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:06,655
all I want to dois go to sleep.

736
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:09,691
And I bet youI've had more sexin places like this

737
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:12,328
than I've ever hadin a bed.

738
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:13,927
I should writea book about it--

739
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:15,804
"The ToiletsI Have Known."

740
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,679
I met my best friendin one.

741
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,835
Well, she was.

742
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,712
I was working downtown.

743
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,470
Hanging around looking for tricks

744
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,627
when this girl comes along acting like she's stoned

745
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,425
or drunk or something.

746
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:35,503
And then I see the blood and I just look at her

747
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:37,261
and I say, "What the fuck?"

748
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:39,100
And she just says, "Blake."

749
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,658
And I see the bastard had cut her

750
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:42,696
right across the stomach. And then I thought,

751
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,132
"If I don't do something fast, she's gonna bleed to death."

752
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,091
So I go rushing her into the theater

753
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:49,488
and I yell to the chick in the box, "Get an ambulance."

754
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,924
I guess she must have just got the manager

755
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:55,401
'cause after a while, this bitch comes busting in and starts laying into us.

756
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,639
Calling us dirty, filthy sluts.

757
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:00,555
And I'm trying to stop the blood, but it just won't fucking stop.

758
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:02,473
And the poor girl, she's starting to go into shock

759
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:04,192
and the manager's yelling at us

760
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:06,269
about AIDS and trying to kick us out.

761
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,308
Without getting too close, of course.

762
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:10,264
But the blood just kept coming.

763
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:12,263
And then in comes Katie.

764
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:14,700
She sorta took control right away, you know.

765
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,778
I mean, even got the manager to help out.

766
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:19,055
She told her to imagine it was her daughter.

767
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,717
If it wasn't for Katie,

768
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:37,635
I don't think the girl would've pulled through.

769
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,033
Katie wanted to know why she didn't go to the cops.

770
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:41,631
I laughed.

771
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:44,508
I told her Blake pays the cops to look the other way.

772
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,985
Anyway, he got her a few weeks later,

773
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:49,462
but this time, the knife went straight through.

774
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:51,939
That was a terrible week.

775
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:55,215
I don't know what the hell I would've done without Katie.

776
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:58,173
She looked after me like a sister would.

777
00:40:58,173 --> 00:41:00,251
If I would've had one.

778
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:03,287
Sometimes I wonder why my parents ever had me.

779
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,326
They must've been drunk.

780
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,922
I guess I was why Dad left home.

781
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,398
Katie was the only person

782
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:13,835
I ever knew that never wanted.

783
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,834
I wanted. I needed.

784
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:19,550
There were nights I needed so badly just to be held.

785
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,308
For my birthday,

786
00:41:21,308 --> 00:41:22,905
Katie bought me a book.

787
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:24,904
Nobody ever gave me a book before.

788
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:26,622
It's called "Animal Farm"

789
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:28,939
and I'm telling you, it's just like life.

790
00:41:28,939 --> 00:41:31,416
It's about animals, but it's not for kids.

791
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,894
It's the best book I ever read.

792
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:36,890
Well, it's the only book I ever read.

793
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,527
And on the inside cover she wrote,

794
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:41,125
"To Liz

795
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,483
with love and all beautiful things. K."

796
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:48,237
Sometimes I used to open it just to read that.

797
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:51,035
I just loved being with her.

798
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,913
She even turned me on

799
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:55,071
to serious music for a while.

800
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:58,747
( music playing )

801
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,286
She was so smart.

802
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,323
She could make almost anything sound interesting.

803
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:21,801
Katie worked as a bartender.

804
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:24,040
She made good money, but what a waste.

805
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,917
I mean, she went to junior college.

806
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,314
I kept telling her she should get a good job

807
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:30,113
like a teacher or something.

808
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:32,750
She'd make a great teacher.

809
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,748
God, I wish I had her brains.

810
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:36,346
And I told her that.

811
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,024
She said there's nothing wrong with my brain,

812
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:39,702
only my education.

813
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:41,420
My education?

814
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,737
That can't be right

815
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:44,576
'cause I hardly finished school.

816
00:42:44,576 --> 00:42:47,055
I mean, I haven't been in school for so long

817
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:48,893
that I can't even remember anything.

818
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:39,476
( man moaning )

819
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:41,595
That was the end of Katie and me.

820
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:43,233
( woman smacking lips )

821
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:48,587
Sharp as a razor.

822
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:50,305
And I'd use it, too.

823
00:43:51,743 --> 00:43:54,380
Once I'd use it on myself.

824
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,337
But now I'd fight back.

825
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:58,736
That's Katie.

826
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,493
( man moaning louder )

827
00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:11,721
Huh. Dignity.

828
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:45,444
( bicycle horn honks )

829
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:56,553
Oh, it's you.

830
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:58,351
You suddenly takin'a liking to rubbers?

831
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,188
I thought you might havetaken a disliking to them.

832
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:03,505
- Not on your life.- But I'm exceedingly clean.

833
00:45:03,505 --> 00:45:05,223
I'm sure you are.

834
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:06,621
But look, it's no usesitting there

835
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,980
because I'm notgonna change my mind.

836
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,898
I don't carehow much you pay me.

837
00:45:09,898 --> 00:45:12,375
And I'm not gonna doany business with yousitting here either,

838
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,733
so why don't youjust fuck off?

839
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,651
And take yourlittle horn with you.

840
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:18,609
( horn honks )

841
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:24,282
Why do you insistupon a rubber?

842
00:45:24,282 --> 00:45:27,599
Crabs, clap, syphilis,herpes, AIDS, chlamydia.

843
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,636
Is that enough for youor do you want more?

844
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:31,354
I mean, with all that,

845
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,912
what could you possibly haveagainst a rubber, huh?

846
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:35,830
It's not that I haveanything against them.

847
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,345
It's just that they areusually too small for me.

848
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,499
You gotta be kidding.

849
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:48,256
No. I am not.

850
00:45:48,256 --> 00:45:50,494
I have a very stoutmember.

851
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,531
( laughs )

852
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:54,649
Well, that's the best newsI've heard all day.

853
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:57,406
I'm thrilled for you.Congratulations.

854
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:59,164
Thank you.

855
00:45:59,164 --> 00:46:01,401
But the pleasure is yours.

856
00:46:01,401 --> 00:46:03,039
Oh, Jesus.

857
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,357
You guys still believethat shit, don't you?

858
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:08,314
"In a recentnationwide survey,

859
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:10,512
eight out of 10 prostituteswho expressed preference

860
00:46:10,512 --> 00:46:13,429
said that their vaginapreferred small 'members.'"

861
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:16,385
It sounds like it turns you on,but it does nothing for me.

862
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:18,262
Comprende?

863
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:23,538
It's the cops.

864
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:25,775
I suggest you getthe hell outta here.

865
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:27,812
You go down the streetand then you hang a left.

866
00:46:27,812 --> 00:46:30,450
You go onto the freewaythere and it's right thereon your right.

867
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,007
You can't miss it.The gas station isopen all night.

868
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,325
Uh-huh. Thank you.You are most kind.

869
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,123
You're welcome.

870
00:46:37,123 --> 00:46:39,400
Come here,sweetheart.

871
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:51,707
Now then, you havetwo choices, honey.

( laughs )

879
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:09,928
Shit.

880
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,363
Cops.

881
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:16,319
Now there's a confusedbunch for ya.

882
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,799
They don't knowwhat they want,

883
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,755
so they're alwaysgiving you a choice.

884
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:21,514
Like this last time.This vice cop,

885
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:24,311
he says to me,"Give me head oryou're going to jail."

886
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:25,790
So I give him head.

887
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,706
And then the fucker busts mefor jaywalking.

888
00:47:28,706 --> 00:47:31,382
I didn't use the crosswalkon the way to his dick.

889
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,501
Well, excuse me, Officer,but if your dick had beenlong enough,

890
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:37,017
I wouldn't have had tocross the fucking street.

891
00:47:39,015 --> 00:47:41,773
I wish the beach boyshad busted me.

892
00:47:41,773 --> 00:47:43,970
I could usea night in jail.

893
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,968
Just for the rest,you know?

894
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:50,203
Hey.( gasps )

895
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:56,036
Missed you, baby.

896
00:47:57,516 --> 00:47:59,393
So how muchdid we do tonight?

897
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:02,710
It's-- it's been slow, man.

898
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,106
Oh, yeah?So what have you done?

899
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:07,664
Hey, I told you.It's been slow.

900
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:09,222
So you've probably done,what, four 30s.

901
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:11,899
You might have caughta 50 or two? What is that?

902
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:14,816
- Four 30s, we're talking 120.- Just forget about it.

903
00:48:14,816 --> 00:48:16,614
Wait a minute.What did I say?

904
00:48:16,614 --> 00:48:18,612
You said four 30s,but--

905
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:22,208
Four 30s and two 50s.

906
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,086
Well, it's been slow, right?

907
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:25,565
Yeah.

908
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:28,362
So let's sayyou only did

909
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:29,720
one 50.

910
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,918
You might have gotten boredand did a quick 20.

911
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:33,556
Hey, wait a minute.

912
00:48:33,556 --> 00:48:36,471
What the fuck am I thinking?I forgot about yesterday.

913
00:48:36,471 --> 00:48:38,310
( gasps )

914
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,307
You took off yesterday.

915
00:48:40,307 --> 00:48:44,224
So, uh, what have youbeen doing since yesterday?

916
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,181
What are you doingaround here?

917
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:47,741
Welfare work?

918
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:50,217
You've been with thatbookworm again, hmm?

919
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:52,374
- That dyke Katie.- No. No, no. I--

920
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:55,651
I told you once before,reading is bad for your eyes.

921
00:48:55,651 --> 00:48:57,449
Hey, man, I swear.I haven't seen Katie.

922
00:48:57,449 --> 00:49:00,207
I got this trickand he took me down hereto this motel

923
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,124
- and it was an all-nighter.- Yeah.

924
00:49:02,124 --> 00:49:04,281
I just slept in.I couldn't help it, man.

925
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:06,840
- You should'vemade plenty, right?- He robbed me!

926
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,677
- Bullshit!- I told you, it's been slow.

927
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,993
- Man: Me spare some change? - Don't give me that slow shit.

928
00:49:11,993 --> 00:49:14,071
- You stink of booze.- I'm telling you the truth.

929
00:49:14,071 --> 00:49:16,348
- How 'bout a dollar, then, mon?- Get the fuck outta here!

930
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:17,947
Where is it?Where's the rest of it?!

931
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:20,743
Here, mon. Take the dollar!Leave the woman alone!

932
00:49:20,743 --> 00:49:23,102
- Buzz off!- Hey!

933
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:25,219
Liz: Take your foot off of him! You're hurting him!

934
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:27,176
- Listen to the woman.- Leave him alone!

935
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,776
( gasps )

936
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:30,814
I don't got any more.I swear on my mother.

937
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:33,610
Well, your mother's dead.So you better swear onsomebody else,

938
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,047
but dust don't countin my book.

939
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:38,086
I'm gonna be backin an hour.

940
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:39,683
You better have donefour by then.

941
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:41,721
I don't care whatyou have to do to catch cock.

942
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:43,758
Lie in the streetwith your fucking legsin the air.

943
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:45,396
Just do it.

944
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:48,154
Was that third finger left handor third finger right?

945
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:49,633
Take your pick!

946
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,630
I got it.

947
00:50:05,574 --> 00:50:08,212
Who the fuckdoes she think she is?

948
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,489
You only need onelike that.

949
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:13,646
One bad apple

950
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:15,324
and all the others rot.

951
00:50:16,964 --> 00:50:18,840
And if she thinksthat she can dump me

952
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,918
like I was one of herfucking tricks, well,

953
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:24,714
she's gota big surprise coming.

954
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:26,992
Protection.He is my protection.

955
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:29,548
I mean, we can't evencarry a knife anymore.

956
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,267
You get caught,they bust you

957
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:33,744
on a concealedweapons charge.

958
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:36,701
You work on your back,you gotta have a middleman.

959
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:40,056
Or you could end upon your back in the morgue.

960
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:45,012
I got somebody that willfix her up.

961
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,607
And he'll fix her for good.They'll never recognize her.

962
00:50:51,165 --> 00:50:53,043
Even if they do,who cares?

963
00:50:53,043 --> 00:50:55,481
She's a whore.

964
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:58,597
Hey, it was a trick,wasn't it?

965
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,273
I mean, there are a lotof freaky tricks around,you know?

966
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:06,349
Sometimes tricks,they--

967
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:08,986
they freak out.

968
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,704
What can you do?

969
00:51:12,063 --> 00:51:13,580
There's this one,right,

970
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,618
he was young,but he was small.

971
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:19,055
He was vicious and startssticking it in me right away.

972
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:21,451
All of a sudden,he starts kissing me.

973
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:24,209
Man, I never kiss nobody.

974
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,769
You never do.

975
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:28,004
I mean,I'll suck their cock,they can lick me,

976
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:30,042
they can fuck me,but no kissing.

977
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:31,721
And no fingers neither.

978
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,079
I mean, you shouldsee their nails.

979
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:35,078
I mean, who knows wheretheir fingers have been?

980
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:36,915
No suckingmy breasts neither.

981
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:40,112
So anyway, this guy,he starts trying to kiss me.

982
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:42,628
So I said to him,"Hey, man, I don't kiss."

983
00:51:42,628 --> 00:51:44,108
He didn't seem to mind.

984
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:45,505
All of a suddenhe says to me,

985
00:51:45,505 --> 00:51:47,223
( lowered )"Is it nice?"

986
00:51:47,223 --> 00:51:49,341
I said to him,"Is what nice?"

987
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,941
( lowered )He says, "This,"

988
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,417
and pushes it ineven harder.

989
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:56,174
Now I know he wanted me to talk dirty, right?

990
00:51:56,174 --> 00:51:59,011
I was still pretty new to the game. I didn't understand.

991
00:51:59,011 --> 00:52:01,249
So I said, "It's all right, I guess."

992
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,805
( lowered ) "All right? All right?" he says. "Is that all?"

993
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:06,204
And then he pulls out. So I asked him why he pulled out.

994
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:08,761
And he says, ( lowered ) "Because you're not enjoying it."

995
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:10,519
I said, "Hey, I don't have to enjoy it.

996
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,157
You paid for it. You enjoy it."

997
00:52:12,157 --> 00:52:14,154
And he goes, ( lowered ) "But I can't enjoy it

998
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:16,272
if I know you're only doing it because I paid you."

999
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:18,430
Well, if you want passion, that costs extra.

1000
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,706
By then his time was up, so I asked him if he was finished.

1001
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:23,305
( lowered ) "Finished?" he says.

1002
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:25,022
"I haven't even started yet. Kiss me."

1003
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:27,221
So he yanks my head and he starts trying to kiss me.

1004
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:29,657
And I'm trying to push him away and then he starts shouting to me,

1005
00:52:29,657 --> 00:52:31,656
( lowered ) "You fucking cunts! You're all the same!

1006
00:52:31,656 --> 00:52:33,574
You're dead, all of ya! No feelings!"

1007
00:52:33,574 --> 00:52:35,931
And then he starts trying to kiss me again.

1008
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:37,569
Then he asks for his money back.

1009
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:40,286
I said, "Sorry. No deposit, no return."

1010
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:42,324
Then I tried to get up and get out.

1011
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:44,761
Suddenly, he grabs my bag with one and my hair with the other

1012
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,520
and he starts banging my head against the floor.

1013
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,956
I mean, I thought my fucking brain was gonna explode.

1014
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:51,235
I'm telling you, he must have slammed my head about six times

1015
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,631
before that damn door finally opened.

1016
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:01,463
You oughta be more carefulwith who you date.

1017
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,702
That's when I realized,

1018
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,698
you can't workwithout a pimp.

1019
00:53:05,698 --> 00:53:08,295
So I becameone of Blake's girls.

1020
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:10,173
Well,it seems to me

1021
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:13,090
like this pimpset you up, mon.

1022
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,487
Yeah. I thoughtof that, too.

1023
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:17,766
And one day I put itto him point-blank.

1024
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:20,442
And point-blankhe denied it.

1025
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:23,478
Practically knockedmy goddamn teethdown my throat.

1026
00:53:23,478 --> 00:53:25,517
Me and my girls.

1027
00:53:25,517 --> 00:53:27,315
I look after 'em.

1028
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:30,152
I'm out all hourskeeping an eye out on 'em

1029
00:53:30,152 --> 00:53:32,229
just to make surethey're safe.

1030
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:34,906
I drive aroundjust checking.

1031
00:53:37,024 --> 00:53:40,261
I know all the placesthat they go with their dates.

1032
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:44,856
Sometimes I follow 'em.

1033
00:53:44,856 --> 00:53:48,332
You see, we're likebusiness partners.

1034
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,169
They fuck

1035
00:53:50,169 --> 00:53:52,608
and I manage.

1036
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:54,406
Tell me something.

1037
00:53:54,406 --> 00:53:56,363
How much doeshe make off you?

1038
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,600
What's hisprofit margin?

1039
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,079
What's that gotto do with it?

1040
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,716
Have some herb.

1041
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,107
If I'm not payingfor their rent,

1042
00:54:10,107 --> 00:54:13,345
I'm paying fortheir goddamn fines.

1043
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:15,743
( sniffs )I pay for their clothes,

1044
00:54:15,743 --> 00:54:17,820
their checkups.

1045
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,217
I pay for their rubbers.

1046
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:21,535
( sniffs )

1047
00:54:21,535 --> 00:54:24,333
Even at wholesale,they're still expensive.

1048
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:28,288
Or as I tell you,

1049
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:30,127
they don't come cheap.

1050
00:54:30,127 --> 00:54:31,284
( sniffs )

1051
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:36,399
So how muchyou say he takes?

1052
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,117
100%.

1053
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:40,315
Mon, it's likeyou're gettingscrewed twice.

1054
00:54:41,635 --> 00:54:42,593
Hmm.

1055
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,947
Look, it's just likeI was managing a factory.

1056
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:50,704
This, it just happensto be a pussy factory.

1057
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,620
This is exactly whyI'm trying to getaway from him.

1058
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,578
Even factories treattheir employees better.

1059
00:54:56,578 --> 00:54:58,295
At leastthey get benefits.

1060
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,373
Mm.

1061
00:55:00,373 --> 00:55:02,492
But it's still a factory

1062
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:05,008
with employees

1063
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:07,526
and somebody like merunning things.

1064
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:11,202
I got what they call

1065
00:55:11,202 --> 00:55:13,719
"entrepreneurial flair."

1066
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:16,635
I can see a need

1067
00:55:16,635 --> 00:55:18,514
and I fill a demand.

1068
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:21,549
The man is a slave driver.

1069
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:25,586
Holy shit.Just look at that one.

1070
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:27,023
Dumb kid.

1071
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:33,896
( horn honks )

1072
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:39,210
( horn honks )

1073
00:55:41,529 --> 00:55:43,126
She supposed to beselling sex.

1074
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:45,164
It looks like she's waitingfor the goddamn bus.

1075
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:47,682
Okay, so it's hot,your shoes hurt,

1076
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:49,520
and she had an abortionlast week.

1077
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,757
Guess who picked upthe tab on that one.

1078
00:55:51,757 --> 00:55:53,235
Everybody starts off

1079
00:55:53,235 --> 00:55:55,313
by thinking they're gonnamake a lot of money

1080
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:57,352
and get out of itin a couple of years.

1081
00:55:57,352 --> 00:55:59,548
But it never happens.

1082
00:55:59,548 --> 00:56:01,506
You just stay doing it.

1083
00:56:01,506 --> 00:56:03,585
I've seen some pretty kids

1084
00:56:03,585 --> 00:56:06,581
with faces like dogsafter only six months.

1085
00:56:06,581 --> 00:56:08,298
You know,

1086
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:12,055
they say you can tell a womanthat's been doing this.

1087
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:14,332
That it shows in her face.

1088
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,448
I mean, look at mine.

1089
00:56:19,448 --> 00:56:21,045
Does it show?

1090
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:25,440
In my eyes?That's where it starts,they say.

1091
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,277
In the eyes and thenin the mouth. All hard.

1092
00:56:30,075 --> 00:56:31,834
They're wrong.

1093
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:34,030
Yeah.They're full of shit.

1094
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,509
You better believethey're full of shit.

1095
00:56:35,509 --> 00:56:37,347
Yeah. They're full of shit.You know why?

1096
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,025
Because itstarts in here.

1097
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:40,783
It's like a cancer

1098
00:56:40,783 --> 00:56:44,261
and then it just startseating away at you untilthere's nothing left.

1099
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:46,817
Just an empty shell.

1100
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:49,534
They're oversexedand they're born like that.

1101
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:53,410
Nature's rejectsfrom the moment that theycame into this world.

1102
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,527
All they have to offeris their bodies,

1103
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:57,685
so they might as wellget paid for it.

1104
00:56:57,685 --> 00:57:00,282
They're bornwith a price tag.

1105
00:57:02,361 --> 00:57:03,838
If somebody gave 'ema million bucks,

1106
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,238
they'd be back onthe streets in a week.

1107
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:06,915
They can'thelp themselves.

1108
00:57:06,915 --> 00:57:09,273
There's nothingyou can do about it.

1109
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:13,228
It's like being bornblack or white.

1110
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:16,104
It's just the way they are.

1111
00:57:16,104 --> 00:57:18,302
I must be some useto somebody.

1112
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:21,858
I mean, there must bea reason for me.

1113
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:24,776
Right?

1114
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:27,053
You know, years ago,when I first got started,

1115
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:29,930
before I got thingsstraightened out around here,

1116
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,208
I was alwaysgetting busted

1117
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,644
for pandering,pimping.

1118
00:57:34,644 --> 00:57:36,682
Do you thinkwhat I do is wrong?

1119
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:40,238
I think whata pimp doesis wrong.

1120
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:44,554
I think it's the lawthat's wrong.

1121
00:57:44,554 --> 00:57:46,592
Katie called hima parasite.

1122
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:49,470
Parasite.

1123
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,626
Parasite.

1124
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:53,984
I like that word.

1125
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:55,782
Parasite.

1126
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:58,698
Look, if it was illegalto live off the earningsof others,

1127
00:57:58,698 --> 00:58:01,215
then the stock exchangewould be shut down tomorrow.

1128
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:04,652
And all the employment agencieswould be charged with pimping.

1129
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:07,448
I'm like an employmentagency myself,

1130
00:58:07,448 --> 00:58:09,086
only I'm not legal.

1131
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,845
And I don't wantto be illegal.

1132
00:58:10,845 --> 00:58:13,682
You know,you should be legal.

1133
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:16,879
Then there wouldn't bea need for him.

1134
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:22,352
You make it legaland I'll open an office.

1135
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:24,270
Until then,

1136
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,348
this is my office.

1137
00:58:26,348 --> 00:58:29,225
Some of our regulars,they phone me.

1138
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:31,383
And they tell me whatthey want and I deliver.

1139
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,939
Maybe I'm nothing morethan takeout food.

1140
00:58:34,939 --> 00:58:36,977
Easy, quick,and affordable.

1141
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:40,133
I'm sort ofa dial-a-ride service.

1142
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,491
And I'm real charitable, too.

1143
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:45,128
I always make sureI give a little back.

1144
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:47,645
I even makeregular donations

1145
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:49,963
to the policemen'spension fund.

1146
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:52,239
( laughs )

1147
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:05,266
Do you thinkfor some men,

1148
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:07,743
even a few,

1149
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:10,340
that I'm a curefor loneliness?

1150
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:20,928
Maybe a short-term cure.

1151
00:59:31,996 --> 00:59:33,875
The more I think about it,

1152
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:37,551
the more I'd really like to change my life.

1153
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:40,388
If only I could find a decent man.

1154
00:59:40,388 --> 00:59:42,505
Or even a man that just wanted a...

1155
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:46,541
what you call it?You know, they got a wife

1156
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,737
and then they got a...a mistress. Yeah, that's it.

1157
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:51,694
I'd really love that.

1158
00:59:53,014 --> 00:59:55,131
Where in the hellam I gonna find that?

1159
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:57,049
( horn honks )

1160
00:59:57,049 --> 00:59:58,487
Hey, you wanna move in?

1161
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:01,364
Can you affordthe down payment?

1162
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,122
Who knows? Come here.

1163
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,117
What sign are you?

1164
01:00:08,117 --> 01:00:10,155
- What sign am I?- Quickly.

1165
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:13,072
I'm a stop sign.

1166
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:15,189
Ow! You're a Scorpio.

1167
01:00:15,189 --> 01:00:16,947
- You're a Scorpio, aren't you?- Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.

1168
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,865
- Hey, how'd you know?- Shit. I need a Virgo.

1169
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,584
Do you know whereI can find one?

1170
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,941
- I'll be a Virgo for 40.- No, no. I need a real one.

1171
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:24,780
And my cards sayI can only pay 10.

1172
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,375
- ( sighs )- You have the most beautiful eyes.

1173
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,733
I'll catch youin another lifetime.

1174
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:32,091
Bye.

1175
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,288
What a weirdo.

1176
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,443
I wonder what he was into.

1177
01:00:38,443 --> 01:00:41,242
Eh, I don't mind

1178
01:00:41,242 --> 01:00:43,398
something differentonce in a while,

1179
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:47,034
but I don't donothing dirty.

1180
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:49,232
You know?I mean,

1181
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:51,429
I don't takegolden showers

1182
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:54,946
and I don't givegolden showers.

1183
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:57,464
But...

1184
01:00:57,464 --> 01:00:59,421
well,

1185
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:00,980
there was this one guy,right,

1186
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,376
he used to like watching metake a dump, okay?

1187
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:05,494
I mean, he useda flashlight.

1188
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:07,573
Trouble is,he always seemed to show up

1189
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:09,210
after I'd already had one.

1190
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,368
I haven't seen him aroundin a while.

1191
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:14,165
Guess he found someonemore regular.

1192
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:18,641
Yeah, but I gotthis other trick,

1193
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,078
he's an older guy,you know.

1194
01:01:20,078 --> 01:01:21,636
Real soft-spoken.

1195
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,354
I swear, he could bea judge or doctor or something.

1196
01:01:25,354 --> 01:01:28,548
And we have a regular dateevery Thursday at 3:00.

1197
01:01:28,548 --> 01:01:31,506
And he always pays mewith brand-new money.

1198
01:01:33,224 --> 01:01:35,821
Get the money first. That's my motto.

1199
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:37,899
But before I could get my pants down,

1200
01:01:37,899 --> 01:01:39,218
he's shaking his head.

1201
01:01:39,218 --> 01:01:41,015
So I offer him a tit job.

1202
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:42,654
Strike two.

1203
01:01:42,654 --> 01:01:44,851
When I realized he didn't want straight sex,

1204
01:01:44,851 --> 01:01:46,610
I thought, "Hello, another nut."

1205
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:48,967
And I let him know I didn't do nothing dirty.

1206
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:50,365
I don't do anything dirty.

1207
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:52,924
Then he just nods and points to my shoe.

1208
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:01,952
For a minute, I thought he was gonna fuck me with it.

1209
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:03,592
I mean, you wouldn't believe

1210
01:02:03,592 --> 01:02:05,669
some of the things they've tried to stick up me.

1211
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:07,387
Then he gives me this piece of paper

1212
01:02:07,387 --> 01:02:09,305
and tells me not to read it until he says so.

1213
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:11,942
Finally, he gets his dick out, right?

1214
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:14,100
What do youwant me to do?

1215
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,738
Read me the note.

1216
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:17,775
About now, he's starting to get a hard on.

1217
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,894
Liz: "You naughty boy, Johnny.

1218
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:22,771
You dirty little boy.Mommy's very, veryangry with you"?

1219
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,488
( groaning )Louder.

1220
01:02:24,488 --> 01:02:26,487
Liz: And before you know it, he's beating his meat

1221
01:02:26,487 --> 01:02:28,444
and licking my shoe.

1222
01:02:29,922 --> 01:02:32,320
"You naughty boy, Johnny.

1223
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,557
You dirty little boy.

1224
01:02:34,557 --> 01:02:38,193
Mommy's very, very angry with you.

1225
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:39,951
You naughty boy, Johnny!

1226
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:42,189
You dirty little boy!

1227
01:02:42,189 --> 01:02:45,626
Mommy's very,very angry with you!

1228
01:02:45,626 --> 01:02:48,503
You naughty boy, Johnny!

1229
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:50,500
You dirty little boy!

1230
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,256
Mommy's very, very, very,very angry with you"!

1231
01:02:54,256 --> 01:02:56,374
( groaning continues ) Keep it up.

1232
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:59,409
( yawns )"You naughty boy, Johnny.

1233
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,368
You dirty little boy,Johnny.

1234
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:04,126
Mommy's very,very angry with you."

1235
01:03:04,126 --> 01:03:06,003
( laughing )

1236
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,559
Liz: Different strokes for different folks.

1237
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,354
Who can figure it? But that's how Johnny came.

1238
01:03:20,028 --> 01:03:22,424
Yeah, I know my lines now,

1239
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:24,582
but he's always quick.

1240
01:03:24,582 --> 01:03:26,141
That's what you want, quick.

1241
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:28,458
I mean, some of 'emtake forever.

1242
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:31,215
The nervous ones,they can be a real bitch.

1243
01:03:31,215 --> 01:03:33,652
Sometimes they never geta hard-on at all.

1244
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:36,010
They're too embarrassedto ask for their money back.

1245
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:38,608
Hey, they wouldn'tget it back anyway.

1246
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,965
I mean, if you goto a restaurant and youorder a meal

1247
01:03:40,965 --> 01:03:43,761
and you suddenlylose your appetite,it's not my fault, is it?

1248
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:47,078
The best guys are the onesin the lunch hour.

1249
01:03:47,078 --> 01:03:48,636
They're always in a rush.

1250
01:03:48,636 --> 01:03:50,714
Or the older guys.They're good, too.

1251
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:52,672
I mean, sometimesI'm putting the rubber on

1252
01:03:52,672 --> 01:03:54,791
and then all of a sudden, oops.It's all over.

1253
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:56,907
"Oh, honey. I needed that,"I'd say to them

1254
01:03:56,907 --> 01:03:58,506
and finish them offwith my hand

1255
01:03:58,506 --> 01:04:01,703
and pretend to bereal disappointed and stuff.

1256
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:04,300
You know, so theydon't feel cheated.

1257
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,535
( sighs )

1258
01:04:09,614 --> 01:04:11,570
But you knowwho the worst ones are?

1259
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,249
The young ones.

1260
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,446
I mean, they're alwayslaying these head trs on you.

1261
01:04:16,446 --> 01:04:19,243
Like, ( whiny )"Usually I don't haveto pay for it."

1262
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:21,600
I mean,I don't want to hear that.

1263
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,719
I don't got timefor that shit.

1264
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:25,875
And then they startholding out on you

1265
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,114
like they're doing yousome big favor or something.

1266
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,111
Thanks,but no, thanks.

1267
01:04:30,111 --> 01:04:32,788
I mean, for them,I need a meter like a taxi.

1268
01:04:34,187 --> 01:04:36,424
No, I like the onesthat just want to hurry up,

1269
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:39,260
- get it over with,and go home.- ( clapping )

1270
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,373
Yeah, I'm going home.

1271
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:58,640
( playing harmonica )

1272
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:15,302
That's Chris.

1273
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:17,819
Handsome, isn't he?

1274
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:19,696
He's so smart.

1275
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:22,055
He's six now.

1276
01:05:23,413 --> 01:05:25,770
Yeah, he's atthat age where--

1277
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,527
well, you know,he's grown up and...

1278
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:31,044
well, if hewas living with me,

1279
01:05:31,044 --> 01:05:32,842
how would I explain it?

1280
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:35,200
I mean,I work at night,

1281
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,277
so you could sayI got a night job.

1282
01:05:38,277 --> 01:05:41,592
But then when I go to jailand I don't come homeduring the day,

1283
01:05:41,592 --> 01:05:43,550
I mean,how do I explain that?

1284
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:46,108
Everybody says he's smart.

1285
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,826
You should hear him read.

1286
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:52,221
He knows all the animals.

1287
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,578
I taught him that.

1288
01:05:55,578 --> 01:05:57,656
He loves animals.

1289
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:02,610
He sent me this paintingof his cat.

1290
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:05,647
"This is Mandy,"he wrote on the back.

1291
01:06:05,647 --> 01:06:08,244
"She sleeps inthe washing machine."

1292
01:06:11,361 --> 01:06:13,879
He's with a nice couple.

1293
01:06:13,879 --> 01:06:16,114
They don't haveany kids of their own.

1294
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:20,830
He was sort of adopted.

1295
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,788
After my mom died...

1296
01:06:25,346 --> 01:06:29,301
the courts saidI was an unfit mother.

1297
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:33,976
Yeah, that's whenI moved on.

1298
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:39,890
Chris seemshappy enough, though.

1299
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,124
I wish he was with me,

1300
01:06:45,124 --> 01:06:48,200
but I can see himwhenever I want to.

1301
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,636
But I have to call first,but...

1302
01:06:54,872 --> 01:06:58,469
uh, I don't go back theretoo much.

1303
01:07:01,426 --> 01:07:03,703
It kinda upsets me.

1304
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:08,499
Last time I went back there, I didn't tell him I was coming.

1305
01:07:08,499 --> 01:07:10,376
I stood outside his school

1306
01:07:10,376 --> 01:07:13,493
and waited for the class to end.

1307
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:16,529
He was wearing the jeans I'd sent him for his birthday.

1308
01:07:16,529 --> 01:07:19,446
They're probably still a little too big for him,

1309
01:07:19,446 --> 01:07:22,443
but he'll grow into them.

1310
01:07:22,443 --> 01:07:24,200
His foster mother Rachel,

1311
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,557
she was there waiting to take him home.

1312
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:29,915
I could hardly stand to see him go,

1313
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:33,472
but I don't think

1314
01:07:33,472 --> 01:07:35,389
I'll go back there again, you know.

1315
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:37,786
No, not for a while anyway.

1316
01:07:37,786 --> 01:07:40,703
I don't want Chris growing up hating me.

1317
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:44,020
I don't want him to be ashamed of his mother.

1318
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:49,174
I know he calls Rachel mom,

1319
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:52,570
but he knows whohis real mother is.

1320
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,718
What I wouldn't givefor a nice, cool shower.

1321
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:08,713
No, Chris is better offwhere he is.

1322
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,511
For now, I know that.

1323
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,383
He looks just likehis father.

1324
01:08:17,383 --> 01:08:19,700
We're still married.

1325
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,376
Chances are we'd stillbe together if he hadn'tcheated on me.

1326
01:08:23,376 --> 01:08:26,014
I never cheated on him.

1327
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:29,490
Hey, what I do isn't exactlymaking love, is it?

1328
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:32,206
Hate would be closerto the truth.

1329
01:08:33,365 --> 01:08:35,163
I mean,it isn't even sex

1330
01:08:35,163 --> 01:08:37,281
because sexhas some feelings.

1331
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,558
I mean, if you like somebody,that's sex.

1332
01:08:40,558 --> 01:08:43,435
Well, I don't likeany of these shits.

1333
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,590
No, there must bea better word for what I do.

1334
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,667
But I don't knowwhat it is.

1335
01:08:51,546 --> 01:08:53,224
It's mechanical.

1336
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:55,382
No feelings.

1337
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,258
No.

1338
01:08:59,857 --> 01:09:02,414
I mean, maybe if you reallypsyched yourself up for it,

1339
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:04,212
you could feel something.

1340
01:09:04,212 --> 01:09:06,769
Who wants togo through all that?

1341
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:08,528
I mean,when I was younger,

1342
01:09:08,528 --> 01:09:10,885
I used to make believe

1343
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,923
somebody out herewas loving me.

1344
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,077
But then I got to the pointwhere I just hated tricks.

1345
01:09:18,077 --> 01:09:19,875
I hate 'em.

1346
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:21,913
And they don'tlike us, neither.

1347
01:09:21,913 --> 01:09:24,110
I mean, really like us.

1348
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,907
Oh, they want us, all right.I didn't say that.

1349
01:09:26,907 --> 01:09:29,704
But like us?No. No way.

1350
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,979
And you never knowwho you're with.

1351
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,895
A total strangeror your own father.

1352
01:09:37,895 --> 01:09:39,214
You just don't know.

1353
01:09:39,214 --> 01:09:41,251
I mean, they're likeJekyll and Hyde.

1354
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:44,168
You gotta watch 'em 'causethey're always up to something.

1355
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:45,847
( bicycle horn honks )

1356
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:55,196
20 bucks, sweetie.20 bucks.

1357
01:09:55,196 --> 01:09:56,915
- Okay? - Yeah, try her.

1358
01:09:56,915 --> 01:09:59,232
She'll probably do itfor a food stamp, asshole.

1359
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,108
I'm ready.

1360
01:10:03,108 --> 01:10:05,945
You're cute.

1361
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:07,823
( laughs )

1362
01:10:07,823 --> 01:10:10,380
Poor old whore.

1363
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,338
That could be me someday.

1364
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,615
Nah. I'd kill myself first.

1365
01:10:14,615 --> 01:10:15,854
( gasps )

1366
01:10:24,084 --> 01:10:25,842
( horn honks )

1367
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:46,140
In your professionalopinion...

1368
01:10:48,019 --> 01:10:50,177
what do you thinkmy chances are?

1369
01:10:50,177 --> 01:10:52,534
I'd say your chancesare 50/50.

1370
01:10:58,247 --> 01:11:01,604
And for 50, I'm willingto take the gamble.

1371
01:11:07,237 --> 01:11:08,995
Let's go.

1372
01:11:19,824 --> 01:11:21,622

There it is.Oh, yeah, baby.

1390
01:12:16,122 --> 01:12:17,601
That feels good.

1396
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:34,942
Oh, give it to me, honey.

1397
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:36,660
Oh, yeah.

1398
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,178
Go, baby-- oops.

1399
01:12:39,816 --> 01:12:41,614
Oh, that's it, big boy.

1400
01:12:41,614 --> 01:12:44,571
- Come on. Stick it in.- Oh!

1401
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:46,249
There we go.It's okay, honey.

1402
01:12:46,249 --> 01:12:48,247
- Hang on.- Oh!

1403
01:12:49,646 --> 01:12:53,121
