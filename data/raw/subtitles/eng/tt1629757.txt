Dear Frosty....

Truth is that I am afraid.

1220
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,485
I'm afraid I'll never see my dad again...

1221

...and that my mom
will never find happiness.

I'm afraid of losing Kim...

what they should be.

I know this sounds strange...

...but I've always felt like
I wouldn't be around for very long...

...which is why
I want to take that drop.

1235
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:45,171
Because once I Iook down over the edge...

1236

...and I catch it,
I'll become a part of it.
