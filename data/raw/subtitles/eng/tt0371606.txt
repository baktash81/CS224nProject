1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,437
Now, where to begin?

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:25,482
How 'bout, "Once upon a time"?

3
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,111
How many times have you
heard that to begin a story?

4
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,904
Let's do somethin' else.

5
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,158
I got it, I got it, here we go.
Here's how to open a movie!

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,455
No, I don't think so.
It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,541
Oh, no, no, not the book.

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,544
How many have seen
"opening the book" before?

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,671
Close the book.
We're not doing that.

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,339
Here's what we're gonna do.

11
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,884
Why don't I just
go back to the day

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,970
things took a turn for the worse?

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,146
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,149
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!

15
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,985
Code red! Duck and cover!

16
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,445
You're all in danger!

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,329
Run for cover!

18
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,708
Run for your lives!

19
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,837
Emergency! Emergency!

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,367
- Run for your lives!
- Look out! Take cover!

21
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,012
Run for cover!

22
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,559
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?

23
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,311
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

24
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,565
- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?

25
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,567
No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!

26
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,154
No. Son? What?

27
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,406
It happened under the old oak tree!

28
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,658
I'm not making this up.
I know it's here.

29
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,869
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...

30
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,662
...somewhere
on the ground here.

31
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,747
It was shaped like that!

32
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,083
- It looks like a stop sign?
- Yes!

33
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,920
Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,047
And it hit me on the head!

35
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,633
- It looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?

36
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,677
- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?

37
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,430
No, Dad. It was definitely
a piece of the sky!

38
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,599
Piece of the sky.
It's OK, everyone!

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,602
- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.

40
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,272
It was just an acorn that hit my son.
A little acorn.

41
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,815
- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.

42
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,109
This is embarrassing enough already.

43
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,278
Chicken Little!
What were you thinkin'?

44
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,363
Why put your town's safety
in jeopardy?

45
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,741
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?

46
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,703
- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?

47
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,248
- A big acorn level fluh...
- It was a big acorn?

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,502
- It was an ape throwing coleslaw?
- A big acorn level fluh...

49
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,587
Gesundheit!

50
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,923
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,051
- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!

52
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,511
Your kid went and
scared us all half to death!

53
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,806
Well, what can I tell you, folks,
my son,

54
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,894
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...

55
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,356
No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,525
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,779
You gotta believe me.

58
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,711
A movie. A movie.

59
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,421
They're makin' a movie.

60
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,383
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

61
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,887
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,

62
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,515
then the book on tape,
then the board game,

63
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,226
the spoons with your face on it...

64
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,188
And then the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

65
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,065
- You saw them, right?
- I saw them.

66
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,400
Can't eat off 'em.

67
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,278
- They're not microwave-safe.
- You saw the billboards?

68
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,029
I saw them.

69
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,703
There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.

70
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,164
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.

71
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:55,502
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.

72
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,881
It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,093
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you

74
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,220
it would be better
for you to lay low,

75
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,222
don't call attention to yourself?

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,516
- Yes, but I...
- See, it's like a game.

77
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:14,604
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except
the goal is never to be found, ever!

78
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,567
Great! Now,
we've got a plan, right?

79
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,866
I'll see ya later!
Remember, lay low.

80
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,618
Yeah. OK.

81
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,708
Bye.

82
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,170
Look, Mama!
There's the crazy chicken!

83
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,007
Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!

84
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,971
That's it. Today is a new day.

85
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,233
It was a recipe for disaster

86
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,986
A four-course meal of "No sirree"

87
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,948
It seemed that happily ever after

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,369
Was happy everyone was after me

89
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,456
It was a cup of good intentions

90
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,460
A tablespoon of one big mess

91
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,546
A dash of overreaction

92
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,092
And I assume you know the rest

93
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,720
One little slip

94
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,765
One little slip

95
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,809
It was a fusion of confusion

96
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,978
With a few confounding things

97
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,403
I guess I probably took
the wrong direction

98
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,324
Well I admit I might've
missed a sign or two

99
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,911
I took a right turn at confusion

100
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,206
A left when I should've gone
straight on through

101
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,835
I ran ahead with my assumptions

102
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,255
And we all know
what that can do

103
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,842
One little slip

104
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,972
It was a fusion of confusion

105
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:16,768
And a few confounding things

106
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,564
I get the feeling in this town
I'll never live 'til I live down

107
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,900
The one mistake that seems
to follow me around

108
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,070
But they'll forget about the sky
When they all realize

109
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,322
This guy's about to try
to learn to fly

110
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,658
Or hit the ground

111
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,711
How's it going?

112
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,886
It was a cup of good intentions

113
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,806
A tablespoon of one big mess

114
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,976
A dash of overreaction

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,063
And I assume you know the rest

116
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,149
One little slip

117
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,403
One little slip

118
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,447
It was a humble little stumble

119
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,991
With a big ungraceful

120
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,411
One little slip

121
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:24,961
It was a fusion of confusion
with a few confounding things

122
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,397
Very well. Foxy Loxy.

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,067
- Present, pretty and punctual.
- Goosey Loosey.

124
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,110
Master Runt of the Litter.

125
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,240
Present and accounted for,
Mr. Woolensworth.

126
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,116
Dropped my pencil!

127
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,289
- Loser!
- Henny Penny.

128
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,541
- Here.
- Ducky Lucky.

129
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,750
- Here.
- Fuzzy Wuzzy.

130
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,378
- Here.
- Morkubine Porcupine.

131
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,922
- Yo.
- Fish Out of Water.

132
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,558
Quite. Abby Mallard.

133
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,767
Ugly duckling.

134
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,855
Class! I will not tolerate rude behavior

135
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,234
- at the expense of a fellow...
- Hey, no worries, Mr. Woolensworth.

136
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,115
You mustn't sneak up on me, Ugly...
Abby.

137
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,492
- Where was I?
- Ugly duckling.

138
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,202
Oh, yes.

139
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,871
Chicken Little.

140
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,587
- Tardy again.
- Tardy again.

141
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:54,175
Class, turn to page 62
and translate each word in Mutton.

142
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,011
He.

143
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,846
She.

144
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,848
They.

145
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,891
We.

146
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,603
OK, everyone. Listen up!

147
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,606
I don't wanna hear any quacks,
tweets, oinks, whinnies

148
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,861
or cocklee-doodle-doos
when I say... dodgeball.

149
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,780
Oh, man.

150
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,241
Pump it up!
Pump it, pump it, pump it!

151
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,620
Split into two teams.
Popular versus unpopular.

152
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,371
- Coach?
- Yeah, unpopular?

153
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,166
Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?

154
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,627
Sure! Hit the pig, kids!

155
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,554
Look out!

156
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,222
Calm down, Runt. Just...

157
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,267
Just do what Fish is doing.

158
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,149
Everybody dance now

159
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,533
- Tough morning?
- A run-in with my old nemesis.

160
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,535
- Gum in the crosswalk?
- He won.

161
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,412
Your old foe!

162
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,457
- Incoming on your right.
- Thank you.

163
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,930
Yeah, I heard about the movie.
Tough break.

164
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,557
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,393
That's the least of my problems.

166
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,563
This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.

167
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,440
But that's not gonna get me down.

168
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,693
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?

169
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,319
No, no, no! This one's good.

170
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,406
Look, one moment destroyed my life,
right? One moment.

171
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,658
- Warthog at 3:00!
- I see him!

172
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,704
- Yes!
- So I figure all I need is a chance...

173
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,540
All I need is a chance
to do something great

174
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,085
to make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.

175
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,921
Then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.

176
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,339
Time out!

177
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,302
Nurse!

178
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,850
- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?

179
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,102
So, what do you think?

180
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,895
OK, listen.

181
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,814
You said the sky was falling.

182
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,150
- Your dad didn't support you.
- I...

183
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:19,320
And you have been
hurting inside ever since, right?

184
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,990
- It's hurt. It stung. OK?
- It's hurt, but... Yes.

185
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,867
- That's the nutshell.
- Yes, but...

186
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,702
- No..
- But, it's...

187
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,914
What's got to happen now is
the nut needs to be cracked open.

188
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,667
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!

189
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,337
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

190
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:41,176
Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact!
You see what I'm saying?

191
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,890
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.

192
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,769
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.

193
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,771
- But...
- Here's the real solution.

194
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,482
You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!

195
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,983
- Closure?
- Closure,

196
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,527
talking about something
until it's resolved.

197
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,863
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.

198
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,241
There's a whole section about it
in this month's Modern Mallard.

199
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,703
- Incredibly appropriate!
- I told you, I have a plan.

200
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,705
Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck,

201
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,541
you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk. "

202
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,084
Beautiful Duckling says,

203
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,713
"Avoiding closure with your
parents can cause early molting. "

204
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,965
See? Closure.

205
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,927
Come on, repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...

206
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,805
Abby, Abby, Abby, listen!
Talking's a waste of time.

207
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,099
I got to do something great
so my dad doesn't think I'm a loser.

208
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,227
Come on. You are not a loser.

209
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,481
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...

210
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,066
What?

211
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,445
Yeah... Runt!

212
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,074
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air

213
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,911
or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?

214
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,955
Band-Aid solutions!

215
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,915
- Runt!
- Well, I'm sorry!

216
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.

217
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,419
Fish, help me out here.

218
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,435
Men.

219
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,437
'Twas beauty that killed the beast.

220
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,608
I guess only girls are good at honest
communication and sensitivity.

221
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,406
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!

222
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,826
Prepare to hurt. And I don't
mean emotionally, like I do.

223
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,260
We will save you!

224
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,971
Fall back! Mad goose!

225
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,573
Chicken Little!

226
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,993
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

227
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,079
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?

228
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,500
Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!

229
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,338
Now look, Buck.

230
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,924
You know I have
the utmost respect for you.

231
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,676
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,

232
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,846
our school baseball star.

233
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,644
But let's face the facts.

234
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,773
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.

235
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,983
OK.

236
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,154
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.

237
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,576
I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.

238
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,496
- It was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. It's fine.

239
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,374
You don't have to explain anything.

240
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,646
Hey, Dad?

241
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,693
I was thinkin'.
Yeah, what if I...?

242
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,486
What if...?

243
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,114
What if I joined the baseball team?

244
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,574
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!

245
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,785
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.

246
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,580
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.

247
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,375
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.

248
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:46,087
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.

249
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,798
Really, son?
Baseball. Are you sure?

250
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,801
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?

251
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,928
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,

252
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,556
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

253
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,266
You could give me some pointers.

254
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,727
But son, I'm just wondering...

255
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,981
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

256
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,693
Have you considered the chess team
or the glee club?

257
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,780
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.

258
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,782
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get stamps.

259
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,535
- I don't like stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...

260
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,078
No, I was thinkin' baseball!

261
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,122
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

262
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,791
when I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!

263
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,130
Dad... I'm kidding.

264
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,049
That was a... that was a joke.

265
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,553
Just do me one favor, son.

266
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,847
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.

267
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:42,101
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.

268
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,978
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...

269
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,732
I mean, I think I can...

270
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,076
OK, Dad.

271
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,097
I bruise you

272
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,767
You bruise me

273
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,106
We both bruise so

274
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,441
Easily

275
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,570
Too easily

276
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,782
To let it show

277
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,369
I love you

278
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,124
And that's all I know

279
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,879
Oh, Chloe. If only you were here.

280
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,216
You'd know what to do.

281
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,886
And all my plans

282
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,097
Keep fallin' through

283
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,893
All my plans, they

284
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,063
Depend on you

285
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,900
Depend on you

286
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,821
To help them grow

287
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,947
I love you

288
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,991
- That's my boy!
- Gee, thanks, Dad!

289
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,202
And that's all

290
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:29,250
It's really all I know

291
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,216
It's all I know

292
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,220
Come on. All I need is a chance.

293
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,269
It's all

294
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,525
I know

295
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,038
Yeah

296
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,082
Ohh

297
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,879
I can't sit here
while I go nowhere

298
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,883
Chase my dreams
through the polluted air

299
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,761
I'm walking on a wire

300
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,096
Running out of time

301
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:28,851
There's no room
in this ol' heart of mine

302
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,356
Hungry minds
just stare you in the eyes

303
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,610
Spread it thick
and lay the biggest lies

304
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,154
Words jump off the pages

305
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,365
Passion hits the street

306
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:47,370
Anger's cooking
in the city heat

307
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,332
World's too crazy
I can't take no more

308
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,378
I won't stay here
locked behind the door

309
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,588
Got to stir it up

310
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,007
I got to break it up now

311
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,551
When I think about tomorrow

312
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,263
Ooh, I can't wait to

313
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,100
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now

314
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,936
If I have to beg or borrow

315
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,690
I'm not gonna take it anymore

316
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,443
Oh-oh oh-ohh-oh oh-ohh-oh
Come on

317
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,363
So much pressure
to keep holding on

318
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,614
Whoa

319
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,325
Pack my clothes up baby

320
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,160
I'll be gone

321
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:32,331
Stir it up
Got to break it up now

322
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,875
When I think about tomorrow

323
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,879
I can't wait to
Stir it up

324
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,549
I got to shake it up now

325
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,968
If I have to beg or borrow

326
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,887
I'm not gonna take it no more

327
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,723
Lean to the left
Lean to the right

328
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:53,269
C'mon Acorns
Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!

329
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,068
There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.

330
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,447
It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals

331
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,407
the Spud valley Taters.

332
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,785
Down by only a single run,
with a player in scoring position,

333
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,912
we finally have a chance again.

334
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,333
This excitement isn't about
the fun of baseball, the prize.

335
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,169
It's about the gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,

336
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,921
the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting

337
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,924
- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!

338
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,513
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and Mayor Turkey Lurkey

339
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,517
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!

340
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,521
Hey.

341
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,773
Whoa!

342
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,776
This battle has taken a heavy toll
on our hometown heroes.

343
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,905
After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,

344
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,075
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.

345
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,454
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.

346
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,333
Up next... Chicken Little.

347
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,588
Clearly a long shot, folks.

348
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,633
Little hasn't been up to bat once
since joining the team.

349
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,885
- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- But wait!

350
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,263
If he can just get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse,

351
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,226
Foxy Loxy can step up
and save us all.

352
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,605
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MvP trophy.

353
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,358
OK, kid, listen up.

354
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,152
You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.

355
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,531
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.

356
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,325
- I have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.

357
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,744
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!

358
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,247
- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!

359
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,753
Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold
the pine, Little advances to the box.

360
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,630
He's going to bat from the right.

361
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,800
Make it the left. No, the right.

362
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,094
- The right.
- Easy out!

363
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,180
Looks like left field's
found something better to do,

364
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,975
center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach

365
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,019
- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!

366
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,399
Why him? Why now?

367
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:09,280
I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.

368
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,491
Here's the wind-up, the pitch!
It's a high cutter.

369
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,118
Ball!

370
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,289
Strike one!

371
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,878
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

372
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,756
The catcher lays down the signals.
Here's the pitch.

373
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,050
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

374
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,970
Strike two!

375
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,513
No!

376
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,892
I said, don't swing!

377
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,436
Don't swing!

378
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,272
- No!
- Batter up!

379
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,027
Two in the hole!

380
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:52,364
One more strike, it's a punch out,
folks, and we're all going home.

381
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,245
Today is a new day.

382
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,756
Don't swing!

383
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,936
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!

384
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
A hit?

385
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,104
- A hit?
- A hit?

386
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,731
A hit?

387
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,529
But wait! The batter
is still at home plate.

388
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,864
He's standing in a daze.
Run, kid, run!

389
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,908
Go, son! Run! Run!

390
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,327
Run!

391
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,040
There he goes,
headed the wrong way.

392
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,251
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

393
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,420
- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

394
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,632
Wait, wait! He's turned!
I've never said these words before,

395
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,842
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

396
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,845
- Goosey Loosey steps on home...
- Today's a new day!

397
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,765
We have a tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

398
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,102
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!

399
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:07,523
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.

400
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,651
Catch is complete,
but where's the ball?

401
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,654
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

402
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,615
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

403
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,827
- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

404
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,912
It's the old tip-the-cow play.

405
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,498
The kid heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!

406
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,500
- Yes!
- Hold up! No!

407
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,711
He's going for the whole enchilada!

408
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,713
The ball of wax,
kit and the caboodle!

409
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,965
Go back!
You're never gonna make it!

410
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,010
He's trying to lighten his load!

411
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,512
The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!

412
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,680
He slides for the dish!

413
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,642
It's going to be a photo finish at home!

414
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,693
You're out!

415
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,367
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.

416
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,244
- Wait!
- Wait, wait!

417
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,289
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

418
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:09,168
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

419
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,296
He's...

420
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,758
Safe! The runner is safe!

421
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:24,099
It's all over, folks!
The Acorns have done the impossible!

422
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,935
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!

423
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,065
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!

424
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,027
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

425
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,739
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

426
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,115
That was just a lucky hit!

427
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,868
Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours!

428
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,496
The victory, the triumph, the glory!

429
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,916
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undies

430
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,876
and chafes for hours!

431
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,922
This is one memory you'll savor forever!

432
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,801
Yeah!

433
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,517
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!

434
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,727
That's my boy!

435
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:20,948
I am the champion, my friend

436
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:28,122
And I'll keep on fightin'
till the end

437
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,628
I am the champion

438
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,215
I am the champion

439
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,468
But gone is the loser

440
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,973
'Cause I am the champion

441
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,144
Of the world

442
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,276
Here's the wind-up and the pitch!

443
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,902
- A knuckleball!
- He swings!

444
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,070
- Crack!
- It's going.

445
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,865
- He rounds first, to second!
- It hits high off the wall!

446
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,075
He flies past third
and heads for the plate!

447
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,078
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!

448
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,330
He is safe!

449
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,333
- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!

450
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,085
The mighty Acorns win!

451
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,850
Geez, you know,

452
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,228
I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incident

453
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,648
behind us once and for all.
Hey, kiddo?

454
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,817
You bet, Dad.

455
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,616
Unless you think we need... closure?

456
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,410
Closure? What's to close here?

457
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,329
Unless you think we need to close...

458
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,663
- Not me.
- It's closed!

459
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,749
- I agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!

460
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,919
OK, great, Dad. You...
Closure, I dunno.

461
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,636
All right. Enough fun.

462
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,971
Good talk. Good talk, son.

463
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,477
- Here, I'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.

464
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,647
- OK.
- OK, I'm up.

465
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,234
Hey.

466
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,822
Good night, Ace.

467
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,076
Here's the wind-up...
and the pitch!

468
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,760
Thanks.

469
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,846
Thanks for the chance.

470
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,261
No!

471
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,725
A piece of the sky?!
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!

472
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,894
Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!

473
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,021
I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs!

474
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,273
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

475
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,317
You sure?
I thought I heard you yell.

476
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,651
No.

477
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,196
I fell out of bed.

478
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,744
- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?

479
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,120
- There. There!
- Where?

480
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,497
How'd you get over there?

481
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,999
Who're we talking about?

482
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,714
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?

483
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,550
Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

484
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,016
Please be gone,
please be gone, please be gone...

485
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,903
Good.

486
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,923
No.

487
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,862
No.

488
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,960
I gotta call Abby!

489
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,929
Yo, I'll tell you what I want
What I really really want

490
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,390
Tell me what you want
What you really really want

491
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,350
I'll tell you what I want
What I really really want

492
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,477
So tell me what you want
What you really really want

493
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,938
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna

494
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,232
Really really
really wanna zigazig ah

495
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,694
If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends

496
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,447
- Gotta get with my friends
- Make it last forever

497
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,659
Friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover

498
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,329
You have got to give
Taking is too easy

499
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,875
- But that's the way it is
- Hello! Mallard residence.

500
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,501
Tell you what I want

501
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,712
Runt! Quiet! I'm on the phone!

502
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,756
I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna

503
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,466
- I wanna really...
- Runt!

504
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,680
Hey! Where are you?

505
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,349
- We already started. We were just...
- It opened up!

506
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,434
What?!

507
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,646
All right, guys. Watch this.

508
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,442
Bizarre.

509
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,738
OK. Lemme guess.
You haven't told your dad yet.

510
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,323
- Well...
- I knew it!

511
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,825
Why haven't you told him?
There hasn't been

512
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,912
- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking. "
- There was talking.

513
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,499
- There was definitely talking.
- Really? What did he say?

514
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,003
What?

515
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,215
All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

516
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,343
You have got to stop messing
around and deal with the problem!

517
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,136
- She's right!
- Abby, please.

518
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,347
This is what
fell on me the first time.

519
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,724
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.

520
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,017
- No, he's not.
- Runt!

521
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,520
Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.

522
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,190
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.

523
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,609
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

524
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,238
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

525
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,990
I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.

526
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,784
Everything back to normal.

527
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,456
Hey, remember when that
icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

528
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,126
Everybody thought
it was from space and stuff?

529
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,672
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

530
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,508
Yeah, that's right.
It's frozen pee.

531
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,886
Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

532
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,430
- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?

533
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,598
- Pee.
- Tinkle?

534
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,975
- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?

535
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,601
OK, subject change.

536
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,522
- Make pishee?
- I don't care what it is!

537
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,402
Are you gonna help me
get rid of it or not?

538
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,674
Flying Fish! Take cover!

539
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,092
Fish!

540
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,971
- No!
- Fish!

541
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,277
Come on, come on, come on!

542
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,864
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?

543
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,827
Chicken Little has something to
tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

544
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,789
Who're we talkin' about?

545
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,251
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

546
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,838
You got to be ready
to listen to your children,

547
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,507
even if they have nothing to say.

548
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,846
- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!

549
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm sorry! Wait!

550
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,734
Sorry!

551
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,153
Curb!

552
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,642
Fish!

553
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,043
Abby!

554
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,836
Abby! Wake up!

555
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,090
Come on! Let's get outta here!

556
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,431
Oh, poor Fish!

557
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,060
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...

558
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:02,649
...maybe he's a half-living host
implanted with face-hugging babies.

559
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,111
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!

560
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,988
- Gone, man!
- Not yet!

561
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,203
Oh, snap.

562
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,478
Fish.

563
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,561
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!

564
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,115
Fish.

565
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,201
Fish.

566
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,788
Where are you, Fish?!

567
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,751
I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!

568
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,336
- Runt.
- You're just fine.

569
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,755
I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!

570
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,424
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!

571
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:56,095
Just leave me some ammo, little
water, some chips if you have 'em.

572
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,805
Calm. OK, all right. Listen.

573
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,849
- Where's your bag?
- Everything's OK.

574
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,852
- Now breathe.
- Breathe.

575
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,104
- No, slowly.
- Slowly.

576
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,523
Slowly.

577
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:11,027
OK. Now, just do
the thing you do to relax.

578
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,409
Well, you can tell by the way

579
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,704
I use my walk I'm a woman's man

580
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,040
No time to talk

581
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,087
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive'

582
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,141
Fish!

583
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,978
Fish! Are you OK?

584
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,896
Did they hurt you? Say something!

585
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,691
Don't tap the glass.
They hate it when you do that.

586
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,360
All right, let's get out of here.
Where's Runt?

587
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,722
We're next.

588
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,060
Run!

589
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,478
OK! That's it!

590
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,939
We're running back to your house.
Tell your dad!

591
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,691
OK! You're right, you're right!

592
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,467
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

593
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,093
Stayin' alive

594
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,600
Oh, Runt!

595
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,020
Push! Push! No!

596
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,940
- Runt!
- No! Not pull! Push!

597
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,110
We gotta get outta here right now!
Come on...

598
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,946
No! Come on, you guys! Hu...

599
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,366
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

600
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,117
OK, time out!

601
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,830
So... have you been to the mall?

602
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,799
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

603
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,092
I'm sorry.

604
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,052
Tension makes me bloat.

605
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,646
Come on, guys! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

606
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,595
Look out!

607
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:28,933
Thanks! Curse these
genetically tiny legs!

608
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,187
What's that noise?

609
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,357
Sorry. Nervous eater.

610
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,614
- Run!
- Wait! Fish!

611
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:33,206
The school bell! We've got to ring
the school bell to warn everyone!

612
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,249
Come on!

613
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,975
Hurry! Hurry!

614
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,188
Go! Go!

615
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,794
It's locked!

616
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,588
They're... they're comin'.

617
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,136
I need a soda.

618
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,890
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy!

619
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,434
- The corner's wrinkled!
- Why are we doing this?

620
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,190
Come on, take it, take it!

621
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,400
Yes!

622
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,654
Come on! Work! Work!

623
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,198
Work! You work!

624
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,953
What happened?
I blacked out there for a second.

625
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,811
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

626
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,522
It was just an acorn. A little acorn!

627
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,108
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

628
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,445
Ring the bell!

629
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,907
Come on, Chicken Little!
Ring the bell!

630
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,893
What?

631
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,897
Let's check the weather with Riz.

632
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,440
A cold front is moving in so...

633
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,985
The alarm bell has been activated!
Quick! Get a camera crew!

634
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:28,714
Chicken Little! You better
have a good explanation for this!

635
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,009
There's, there's... It's a...
You have to... D'oh! Doo wah!

636
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,052
What did he say?

637
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,263
There's... It's a... You have to...
D'oh! Doo wah!

638
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:40,518
Follow me! Come on!
Hurry! Hurry! Aliens here!

639
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,728
Aliens here!

640
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,524
It's... it's happening again.

641
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,235
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

642
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,116
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!

643
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,745
Quick! Quick! It's taking off!

644
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,248
Come on! If you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!

645
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,458
Oh, look! A penny!

646
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,795
- Guys!
- Oh, right.

647
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,260
Hurry! Hurry!

648
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,555
Come on! Quick! It's taking off!

649
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,266
Come on! Hurry up! Please!
It's right in...

650
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,229
- What are we lookin' for?
- I don't know.

651
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,650
Yeah. OK. I know this looks bad,

652
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,611
but there's an
invisible spaceship right there

653
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,864
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!

654
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,782
Let me show you.

655
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,660
Bad throw.

656
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,787
OK, let me try again.

657
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,498
- Bad throw.
- We all know I don't have a good arm,

658
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,126
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.

659
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,880
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.

660
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,716
It's the acorn thing all over again.

661
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,925
There's no story here.

662
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,595
At least we can sell
the video to Chickens Gone Wild.

663
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:01,140
- I'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!

664
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,643
It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!

665
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:08,022
And maps with planets
with x's through them!

666
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,315
Runt, that's enough!

667
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,359
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!

668
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:15,321
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

669
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:19,283
Why can't you keep that
child of yours under control?

670
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,828
- What kind of parent are you?
- Everybody, I'm telling the truth.

671
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:27,374
Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!

672
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,877
You gotta believe me this time.

673
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,182
No, son. I don't.

674
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,814
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

675
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:53,109
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.

676
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,944
Looks like this is just

677
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:59,198
a big, crazy misunderstanding.

678
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:03,702
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!

679
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:09,500
Mr. Cluck, don't take it so hard.
No one blames you.

680
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,366
Reports of panic and mayhem
are pouring in

681
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,411
after yet another
Chicken Little incident last night.

682
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,623
In one instance, a family
of lemmings was sent running in fear,

683
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,168
but unable to find a cliff,
they instead began throwing themselves

684
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,795
- from the nearest park bench.
- Hello? I'm sorry.

685
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,007
Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me break! Hello?

686
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,801
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.

687
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,013
I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.

688
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,556
You have hate mail.

689
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,143
- I'm truly sorry. That wasn't funny.
- You have more hate mail.

690
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,103
Hi. What are you saying, sir?

691
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,189
Your hate mail box is full.

692
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,108
Oh, yes.
I do see the skywriting there.

693
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,780
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?

694
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,741
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch your mouth. Yeah?

695
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:09,495
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'd like to see you try.

696
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,414
OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.

697
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,751
Hello? Really. Well...

698
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:37,898
If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad, it's now.

699
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,987
It's too late for that.

700
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:49,326
It's too late, baby,
now it's too late.

701
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,287
Though they really
did try to make it.

702
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,997
Runt.

703
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,374
Just think about it.

704
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,128
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide

705
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:03,924
and they just can't fake it.
Oh, no, no.

706
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,723
Runt, I just really want
to be alone right now.

707
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,068
Abby! Runt! Fish!

708
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,321
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!

709
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,532
- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!

710
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,585
- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?

711
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,337
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

712
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,424
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.

713
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,803
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.

714
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,514
Here, blow.

715
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,266
OK.

716
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,944
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.

717
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,208
Run!

718
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,597
Those are your parents?

719
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,392
And they brought the galactic armada?

720
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,941
- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.

721
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,818
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

722
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,363
I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.

723
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,408
- Look up! There it is!
- Dad, you know, about that...

724
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:37,369
- It's actually just a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?

725
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,247
This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!

726
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,000
We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who else will?

727
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,626
What?!

728
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:49,423
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

729
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,091
Son!

730
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:55,137
Son, come back!
Son! Chicken Little!

731
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,931
Mr. Cluck! Wait!
He's telling the truth!

732
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:03,228
He is! Though, given his track record,
we understand why you don't believe him!

733
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,150
It's the end of the world
as we know it

734
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:12,946
It's the end of the world
as we know it

735
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:17,493
It's the end of the world
as we know it

736
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,163
And I feel fine

737
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,710
It's the end of the world
as we know it

738
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:36,094
It's the end of the world
as we know it

739
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:41,099
And I feel fine

740
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:53,070
Watch out for the kid! No! Don't!
Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!

741
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,512
Chicken Little!

742
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,222
What? Where's your head?

743
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,432
We gotta get outta here!
Come on! Come o...

744
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,185
- You, with the running and the jumping!
- Dad. No, wait.

745
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,688
What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!

746
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,606
It's like
War of the Worlds out there!

747
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,150
- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for one second!

748
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,444
- It's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!

749
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,156
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?

750
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,661
- You're never there for me!
- What?

751
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,663
OK, that's not what
I had in mind, but...

752
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,748
You're never there for me.
I mean,

753
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,002
you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.

754
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,878
And not at the ball field
and not now!

755
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,839
This is good!
Keep going. Keep going!

756
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,174
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.

757
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,344
We have to talk because
Modern Mallard says avoiding closure

758
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,388
can lead to molting.
I'm already small

759
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,099
and I don't think
I could handle being bald!

760
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:13,942
I didn't... realize, son.

761
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,571
I never meant to...

762
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,782
The acorn, the sky,
I mean, the whole...

763
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,496
You're right. You're right.

764
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,714
Your mom, she was...

765
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,801
You know, she was
always good with stuff like this.

766
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,890
Me...

767
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,518
...I'm gonna need a lot of work.

768
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,398
But you need
to know that I love you,

769
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,026
no matter what.

770
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,487
And I'm sorry I...

771
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,620
And I'm sorry if I ever made
you feel like that was something...

772
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,665
...you had to earn.

773
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,808
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.

774
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,434
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

775
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,604
OK, Dad. Now, all we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

776
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,902
Return this whatever it is?

777
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,697
This is crazy! Crazy!

778
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,532
Crazy wonderful!

779
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,617
Just tell me what you need me to do.

780
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,246
- Do you really mean it?
- You bet! Anything, son.

781
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,959
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!

782
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:59,005
Crazy supportive. That's me!

783
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,384
This thing likes to nibble, doesn't it?

784
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:09,099
By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!

785
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,027
Now that's closure.

786
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,159
Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!

787
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,791
They've given her
an alien mind-wipe!

788
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,171
OK, son. What do we do now?

789
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,922
OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.

790
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,718
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.

791
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:50,348
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!

792
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,684
Key to my car?

793
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,520
Tic Tac?

794
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,857
Forget plan A!

795
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,250
OK, OK, what now, son?

796
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,753
Who, by the way,
I support 100 percent.

797
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:24,591
- Plan B?
- Of course! Plan B! What is plan B?

798
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,553
What? You have to go to the bathroom?
You want juice?

799
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,680
A snack?
Corn dog on a stick?

800
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,891
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!

801
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,061
I stink at this.
I'm a horrible father.

802
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,646
No, no, no, I am. I am.

803
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,487
Is that your parents?

804
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,115
That's it, Dad! Plan B!

805
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,410
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square

806
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,830
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.

807
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,415
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof

808
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,085
and give the kid
back to its parents.

809
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,296
Yeah!

810
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,424
Charge!

811
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,617
Now that's what
I call takin' out the trash!

812
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,920
OK, son. Now what?

813
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,255
Fire truck!

814
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,012
Plan C!

815
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,101
Runt, no! Turn around!

816
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,271
- Go back to Town Hall!
- But they'll vaporize us!

817
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,109
- You want me to do what?
- Runt, just do it! It'll work!

818
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,153
We'll survive!

819
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,531
I will survive?

820
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,742
Brake, Abby!

821
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,660
OK.

822
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,163
Floor it!

823
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,461
Deploy ladder, Fish!

824
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,137
I'll survive

825
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,265
I will survive
Hey, hey

826
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,522
- Plan D.
- Plan D.

827
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,941
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

828
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,778
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.

829
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:54,491
But loving you!
Full support!

830
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,127
I can't get out!
Come back, son!

831
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,254
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.

832
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,590
- No, Dad, I can do this!
- It's too dangerous.

833
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,717
I can do this. I can.

834
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,137
You gotta believe me this time.

835
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,764
I...

836
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,102
I do, son.

837
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,690
OK, hang on tight.

838
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,284
- Yes!
- Here's your kid! Look over here!

839
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,036
Here's your kid!

840
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,788
He's OK!

841
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,631
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!

842
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,634
Son! Son!

843
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:06,271
- I'm here, son!
- Dad! Look out!

844
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,274
Get away from my boy! Get away!

845
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,240
The mighty Acorns...

846
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,502
Tic Tac?

847
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:34,466
Why did you take our child?

848
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,136
Just... Just hold on there, buddy!

849
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,430
My son did not take your kid!

850
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,390
You were the one
that left him behind!

851
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,268
That's bad parenting!
And I should know!

852
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,479
Silence!

853
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,607
Release the child!

854
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,693
- OK.
- OK, OK.

855
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:00,325
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
I'm so happy to see you! My darling!

856
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,329
- That was close.
- At least they're back together.

857
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,497
They got their kid.

858
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:09,626
You have violated
intergalactic law 90210!

859
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:14,589
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!

860
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,136
Oh, snap.

861
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,307
What's that?

862
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,645
I don't quite...

863
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:32,190
Melvin, honey? He's saying
they're telling the truth.

864
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,150
It was just a misunderstanding.

865
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,447
Well, then. This is awkward.

866
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,491
- Yes, it is.
- I suppose I should...

867
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,244
- Put the big guns away?
- Yes, yes.

868
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:47,122
- Now put them down.
- Of course.

869
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,001
- And turn off your big voice.
- But I don't...

870
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,378
- Turn it off.
- But...

871
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,964
But I don't get to use
the big voice very often!

872
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,549
Melvin.

873
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,843
Yes, dear.

874
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:08,143
Hi. Anyone want
to try the big voice?

875
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:17,068
Again, I cannot tell you how sorry
we are for this whole misunderstanding.

876
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,487
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.

877
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,990
We are. And if it
hadn't been for your son there,

878
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,909
well, we might have
vaporized the whole planet.

879
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,077
What?

880
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,371
Goodness!
What a shame that would have been.

881
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,290
- Tell 'em!
- Where would we pick acorns?

882
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,375
We stop here
on the way to the in-laws.

883
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,253
- Every year.
- Looked on all the other planets.

884
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:39,007
- You only find them on Earth.
- As it says on your graphic display.

885
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,092
That caught our eyes.

886
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,220
OK, everything's
been put back to normal,

887
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,472
except for this one, over here.

888
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,308
Hi, y'all!

889
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,392
Foxy?

890
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,312
Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli lolli lolli

891
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:53,396
Lollipop...

892
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,441
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.

893
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,860
No worries!
We can put her back the way she was.

894
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,446
No! She's perfect.

895
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,448
Lollipop!
Lollipop!

896
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,241
Scary.

897
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,578
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.

898
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:11,956
All right, then.
It was good meetin' ya.

899
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,876
Sorry for the whole
full-scale invasion thing.

900
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,421
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.

901
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:22,592
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.

902
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,681
There goes that panel again.

903
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,892
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.

904
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:34,270
Seriously, honey, someday it's
going to hit somebody on the head.

905
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,981
- Nonsense!
- You can't return the panel, can you?

906
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,068
- Now that's ridiculous.
- You threw away the receipt again.

907
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,152
Silence!

908
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:44,530
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?

909
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:49,702
Who we talkin' about?

910
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:52,830
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

911
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:55,792
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

912
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,378
I just hope they stay true
to what really happened.

913
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,256
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

914
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,341
The one thing they'll never do...

915
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:06,511
...is mess with a good story.

916
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:12,892
Red alert! Man your battle stations!
Status report, Mr. Fish.

917
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,020
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army

918
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,357
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.

919
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,109
But that means...

920
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:25,321
Yes, I know.
The sky... is falling.

921
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,073
Commander Little! No!

922
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,951
Please... call me...

923
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,494
...Ace.

924
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,288
Oh, Ace! No!

925
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:37,667
I never intended
to bring you into this... Abby.

926
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,044
- Runt, do you copy?
- Yes, commander?

927
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:44,215
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.

928
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,927
Civilization as we know it
depends on me

929
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,681
and, to a lesser extent... you.

930
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:55,310
So I've just got one question for you:

931
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,895
Are you ready to rock?

932
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:02,191
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...

933
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,236
Ain't no mountain high enough

934
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,573
Raise your pork shield, Runt.
Prepare to engage.

935
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,330
Stay on target.
Stay on target!

936
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,623
Give 'em a taste
of the other white meat!

937
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,418
Cap'n! Look out!

938
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,461
Runt!

939
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:23,087
Runt, are you all right?

940
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:27,216
No, no. Ya gotta go on
without me, commander.

941
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:33,139
Just leave me some ammo,
a little water,

942
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,183
some chips if you have 'em.

943
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:38,144
This is amazingly accurate.

944
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,941
He was my good friend.

945
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,693
Oh, Abby.

946
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,364
At least I still have you... Abby.

947
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,449
- Ace!
- Abby.

948
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,038
Ace!

949
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:00,583
Good people of Oakey Oaks.

950
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:05,213
Though at times it may feel
like the sky is falling around you,

951
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,631
never give up.

952
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:11,219
For every day... is a new day!

953
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,721
A new day!

954
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,265
Ain't no mountain high enough

955
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:19,143
Ain't no valley low enough

956
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,437
Oh, Ace!

957
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,648
To keep me from you

958
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,942
Ain't no mountain high enough

959
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,403
Ain't no valley low enough

960
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,530
Ain't no river wild enough

961
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:33,074
To keep me from you

962
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:37,495
Ain't no mountain high enough

963
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,206
Nothing can keep me

964
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,333
Keep me from you

965
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:47,088
Ain't no mountain high enough

966
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,173
Nothing can keep me

967
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,009
Keep me from you

968
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,512
Ain't no mountain high enough

969
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,848
Ain't no valley low enough

970
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,975
Ain't no river wild enough

971
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,561
To keep me from you

972
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,812
To keep me from you

973
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,773
Nothing in this world

974
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,859
Nothing in this world

975
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:11,028
Can keep me from you, babe

976
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,698
Just call my name

977
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,963
Don't go breaking my heart

978
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,592
I couldn't if I tried

979
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:37,221
Oh, honey, if I get restless

980
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:40,892
Baby, you're not that kind

981
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,899
And nobody knows it

982
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:53,404
- When I was down
- I was your clown

983
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,201
And nobody knows it

984
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,411
Nobody knows

985
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,413
Right from the start

986
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,624
I gave you my heart

987
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,961
I gave you my heart

988
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,258
Don't go breaking my heart

989
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,929
I won't go breaking your heart

990
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:21,140
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my

991
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,142
Don't go breaking my heart

992
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,479
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my

993
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,648
I won't go breaking your heart

994
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:32,026
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my

995
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,653
Don't go breaking my heart

996
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,530
Come on, Runt. You can do it.

997
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:39,242
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart

998
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:42,787
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my

999
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,872
You got to act quickly, Dad.
Try this.

1000
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,749
- Don't go breaking my
- There you go!

1001
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,584
- Don't go breaking my
- There it is!

1002
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,878
I won't go breaking your heart

1003
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,798
I'm having fun now!

1004
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,551
Don't go breaking my heart

1005
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,303
That was great!

1006
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,139
Let's sing it again!
