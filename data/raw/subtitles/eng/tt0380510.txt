00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:30,851
<i>... too small to see
over the edge of a table.</i>

4
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:35,437
<i>There was a snow globe.</i>

5
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:40,680
<i>And I remember the penguin
who lived inside the globe.</i>

6
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:48,922
<i>He was all alone in there
and, I worried for him.</i>

7
00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:00,067
Don't worry, Kiddo...
He has a nice life.

8
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:03,396
He's trapped in a perfect world.

9
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,008
Look at that, Susie Q.

10
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:14,112
<i>I remember being given a camera
for my birthday.</i>

11
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:21,785
<i>I loved the way a photo
could capture a moment...</i>

12
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,050
<i>before it was gone.</i>

13
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:29,519
<i>That's what I wanted to be
when I grew up -</i>

14
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,124
<i>- a 'wild-life photographer'</i>

15
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:35,337
Sorry, mom.

16
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:41,374
<i>I imagined that when I was older,
I'd be tracking wild elephants and rhinos.</i>

17
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,256
<i>But, for now, I'd have to
make do with Grace Tarking.</i>

18
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:05,578
<i>It's strange, the memories you keep.</i>

19
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:11,290
<i>I remember going with dad
to the sink-hole out at the Connor's farm.</i>

20
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:22,853
<i>There was something about the way
the earth could swallow things whole.</i>

21
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:30,774
<i>And I remember the girl who lived there.
Ruth Connors.</i>

22
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:35,561
<i>The kids at our school said
she was weird,</i>

23
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:40,018
<i>and now I know she
saw things other didn't.</i>

24
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:45,453
Ready?
One, two, three!

25
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:54,872
<i>And I remember the worst thing
that ever happened to us as a family.</i>

26
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,504
Somebody help!
- Mom?

27
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:02,249
Where are you?
Mom?

28
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,659
Oh God!

29
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:05,197
Dad?

30
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:08,620
<i>The day my little brother
stopped breathing.</i>

31
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,063
Buckley!

32
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:13,581
What happened?
- He swallowed a twig!

33
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,806
Watch out!

34
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:33,923
Are you crazy?
- Sorry!

35
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,395
Buckley.

36
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:20,693
You're okay...

37
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:28,678
And I remember the light in my
parents eyes. The relief.

38
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:31,596
<i>We weren't those people...</i>

39
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:37,631
<i>... those unlucky people, to whom
bad things happened for no reason.</i>

40
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,245
You know the Buddhists say,
"If you save someone else's life..."

41
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,099
<i>Grandma Lynn predicted I would live a long
and happy life, because I'd saved my brother.</i>

42
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:58,049
<i>As usual,
Grandma Lynn was wrong.</i>

43
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:07,414
<i>My name is Salmon, like the fish.
First name, Susie.</i>

44
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:14,344
<i>I was 14 years old when I was murdered,
on December 6, 1973.</i>

45
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,375
(Announcer) Over here next, we have Crystal...

46
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:23,771
<i>This was before missing kids
started appearing on milk cartons,</i>

47
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:27,636
<i>or were feature stories
on the daily news.</i>

48
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:32,606
<i>It was back when people
believed things like that didn't happen.</i>

49
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:40,760
That's right ladies, no matter the size,
it'll hug your girly-girl curves
in all the right places...

50
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,769
If you got it, why not flaunt it...
- Hold on, buddy.

51
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:46,467
Buckley!
- Dad! Look look look!

52
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:54,548
There it is!

53
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:17,572
Who is he?
Does he like you as much as you like him?

54
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,773
Grandma, He's a senior.

55
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,902
He doesn't know I exist.
- He's Cute.

56
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,623
- Grandma, please just drop it!

57
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,241
You're safe now.
He's gone into the record store.

58
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:42,482
<i>I wasn't safe. A man in my
neighborhood was watching me.</i>

59
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:47,148
<i>If I hadn't been so distracted,
I would have realized something was wrong.</i>

60
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:50,902
<i>Cause that sort of thing gives me the
skeevies...</i>

61
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:56,208
<i>But I was too busy, thinking about
the length of Ray Singh's eyelashes.</i>

62
00:08:56,243 --> 00:09:03,321
<i>I counted each one in library time
while he was reading 'Abelard and Heloise'</i>

63
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:08,718
<i>The most seriously tragic love story
ever.</i>

64
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:12,897
So, have you kissed him yet?

65
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:20,475
Why not? You like him, he likes you,
What's the hold up?

66
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,620
I'm just afraid I won't be any good at it.

67
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:28,958
My first kiss was with grown man.

68
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:35,542
You not going to tell on me, are you?
- Of course not.

69
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,893
- What was it like?
- The kiss? Oh it was wonderful.

70
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:42,634
Beautiful, glorious.

71
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:48,789
Took me a long time before I realized that
a kiss like that, it only happen just once.

72
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:56,022
Susie...

73
00:09:56,678 --> 00:10:00,408
Just have fun, kid.

74
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:08,114
<i>It wasn't Mr. O'Dwyer, by the way.
Although, he does look kinda suspicious.</i>

75
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,116
<i>Mr. O'Dwyer never hurt anyone.</i>

76
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:17,331
<i>Mr. O'Dwyer's own daughter died
a year and a half after I did.</i>

77
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:23,157
<i>She had leukemia,
but I never saw her in my heaven.</i>

78
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:30,055
Hey, look at me!

79
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,056
Mom!
Hi honey!

80
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,567
<i>My murderer was a man from our
neighborhood</i>

81
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,354
Thank you so much.
Careful honey.

82
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:42,613
<i>I took his photo once as he talked
to my parents about his border flowers</i>

83
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,271
<i>I was aiming for the bushes,
when he got in the way.</i>

84
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:51,392
Thanks for the flowers!

85
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:55,353
<i>He stepped out of nowhere,
and ruined the shot.</i>

86
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:58,988
<i>He ruined a lot of things.</i>

87
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:02,138
- What have you been photographing?

88
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,457
Everything!
- Everything?

89
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,114
Hey look at me!

90
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:29,437
Mom!

91
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:39,320
smile!

92
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,056
Over here!

93
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,507
Hey look at me!

94
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,857
OK. Here we go.

95
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,351
Clarissa has got a crush on you.

96
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,727
Which one was Clarissa?

97
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:36,421
You know, blond hair,
mega blue eye shadow...

98
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:40,454
she's out on Surf & Turf.
- The tall one?

99
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:44,056
She's not tall, she wears platforms.

100
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:47,993
She doesn't know you are an accountant.
- I take it, that's a negative

101
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,770
Or that you are a
closet scale modeller

102
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:55,673
Did mom know before she married you?

103
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:58,098
About your obsession?

104
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:02,115
Susie, hobbies are healthy,
they teach you things.

105
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,797
Like what?

106
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,544
Like if you start something,
you finish it -

107
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,104
you don't stop until
you get it right.

108
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,213
If you don't get it right,
you start over again...

109
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,381
and you keep on going as long as you have to.

110
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:18,580
That's the way it is, that's what you do.
It's perfectly normal.

111
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:21,641
You know Granpy taught me to do this,
and now I'm teaching you.

112
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:25,082
We're creating something here, for us.
Something special.

113
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:29,643
- I know
You're my first mate, Susie Q.

114
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:32,394
One day, all of this all will be yours.

115
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,808
- Jack, Susie, dinner!

116
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:38,276
Hey hey hey, Wait.
Ready?

117
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:39,413
Yeah

118
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,347
- Now pull it steady
- Give me.

119
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:46,049
Okay, shipman take it away!

120
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:56,132
Now that is a thing of beauty.

121
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:00,701
Come on.

122
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:28,436
I don't believe it.
Would you look at the state of this room?

123
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,783
You're gonna clean this mess up tonight.
- Yeah, I will.

124
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:36,855
Hey mom, we need to get these developed.

125
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:43,865
Susie, You used up all the film?

126
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,794
Do you have any idea
what this is gonna cost?

127
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:53,849
No, no. Absolutely not.
Out of the question.

128
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:57,407
Thanks a lot.
That's my career down the toilet!

129
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,287
Oh, do not be so melodramatic.
- Oh honey, what? What's down the toilet?

130
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:02,858
She's used up all the film
we gave her for her birthday.

131
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,202
All of it!?
- All of it, every single one.

132
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:08,642
Susie...
- It's a crime to be creative in this family.

133
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:13,115
All alright, all right, what...
(What say we pay for one roll a month?)

134
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,597
One roll a month?

135
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:21,623
You realize by the time I see my photos,
I'm gonna be middle aged.

136
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:25,233
Look, we got her 24 rolls of film, right?

137
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:29,379
At 2.99 a piece to develop,
that's $71 and 76 cents.

138
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:33,251
I don't think we're being unfair...
- Oh Honey.

139
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,828
Are we?
- That's why I love you.

140
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,994
Please! Could you just,
not do that at breakfast?

141
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,515
Yes. OK. Whatever you say.

142
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,308
Eat your food, c'mon.

143
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:49,412
It doesn't have a siren, you moron -
it's a cement mixer.

144
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:52,181
Please don't call your brother a moron!

145
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:55,853
Buddy! The cement stays in the bowl, please.

146
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,619
It's not cement, it's my Oaties!

147
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:00,517
Ok...
- Off to school - come on, let's go!

148
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:02,846
Bye, Dad.
-Bye, Susie!

149
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,959
Susie!

150
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:15,323
What's that?
- That's your new hat, sweetie.

151
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,132
Wow mom, I thought you'd given up knitting.

152
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,589
Oh no, I'm still knitting.
You want me to make you one too?

153
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,913
Do you have your gloves with you?
Put them on please, young lady.

154
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:35,018
Susie! Susie - put your hat on!
It's cold!

155
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,804
Holiday! Inside!
Holiday! Come here boy!

156
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:43,153
Ya look a little ruly, Suse!
- Shut up.

157
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,985
No really -
it looks good on you!

158
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,947
This is an exercise in humiliation.

159
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,251
Hey c'mon, we're late.

160
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:18,702
Othello. What is that?
Sounds like a myth.

161
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:21,767
That guy looked pretty stupid
with the black make-up on.

162
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:24,528
Who?
- The one with two first names.

163
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:27,906
Lawrence Oliver.
- What a loser!

164
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,475
I know!
- Clarissa!

165
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,129
- C'mon, let's go.
I'm talking to Susie.

166
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:36,953
Yeah, and I've been waiting for hours for your
jerk-off film club to finish, and I wanna
get out of this dump.

167
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:40,139
It's nice to see you too, Bryan.

168
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:44,949
Are you coming or not?
- Yeah, yeah...

169
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,951
See ya Susie.

170
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,948
Hey Susie

171
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,248
Hi, Ray.
- What did you think of the Moor?

172
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,447
Who?

173
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,408
Othello.

174
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,448
Well, well I just...

175
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:23,489
It was amazing.
Yeah, I mean - it was...

176
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:27,155
Really incredible!

177
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:31,324
I love that play

178
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,948
That's another thing we have in common.

179
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,694
What else do we have in common?

180
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,751
Don't you know?

181
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,952
Crap.

182
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,713
It's ok.
- Fine, I've got it.

183
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,435
Stupid books.
I don't even read them.

184
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,191
Susie, what are you doing Saturday?

185
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:25,036
Are you really from England?

186
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,373
Yes.

187
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,889
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

188
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,545
Forget it!
- This is obscene!

189
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:00,102
Are you listening to me!?
There are no breasts on this anatomy model!

190
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:03,199
There are no eyes or mouth either.
But we were told to draw in the face.

191
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:08,529
Your unnecessary anatomical additions got
the Ellis boy thoroughly boy over-excited.

192
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,508
He stole my drawing!

193
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:14,998
Yes! And now there are pictures of
naked women all over this school.

194
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:17,008
Move along people!

195
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,602
Sir, can I can have my drawing back?
- Certainly not.

196
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:27,625
Did you hear me Singh?
Go.

197
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:29,961
Meet me at the mall,
10 o'clock, Saturday.

198
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:30,364
Now!

199
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:34,413
Where in the mall?
- The Gazebo.

200
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:25,064
Hello.
- Dad!

201
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:28,321
No no no!

202
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:31,981
God, you're choking me!
I need some air!

203
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:44,254
How was your day?
- Good - Buckley, go wash your hands!

204
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:45,769
Go buddy, we'll play after dinner.
- Is Susie to you?

205
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:48,958
No.
- She's late.

206
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,558
Lindsey Lou, where's your sister?
- What?

207
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:55,568
Your sister.
- Oh, she had film club.

208
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:59,058
What's for dinner, hon?

209
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,256
Oh, Shoot.

210
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,770
I hope that was your homework.

211
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,787
Oh hey, you're the Salmon girl, right?

212
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:45,348
Yeah.
- Remember me? You remember me...

213
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:50,256
I live right down the street,
Down in the, uh - green house. Mr. Harvey.

214
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,717
Hi.
- Hi, how are ya?

215
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:56,591
How are your folks doing?
- They're fine.

216
00:23:56,626 --> 00:24:01,576
Good, tell 'em I said hi. You know, you're
the perfect person for me to run into...

217
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:06,130
Because I've just built this thing over here,
and I want to get second opinion.
Do you mind taking a look?

218
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:11,340
Oh... actually, Mr. Harvey,
I have to get home.

219
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,091
Oh, ok.

220
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,878
I just worked so hard on it, and I guess
I got excited for someone to see it, but...

221
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:29,040
But that's ok. I'll show the other kids
in the neighborhood - they're gonna be
very excited about it.

222
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:34,462
Really?
- Oh, Yeah.

223
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:37,616
It's great, I mean it's really neat.

224
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,354
Come on, it'll take two minutes.

225
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:51,787
You're probably late already.

226
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:04,158
I don't see anything.
- You don't?

227
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,853
You're gonna have to be
more observant, Susie.

228
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,547
What is it?

229
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:38,410
I've washed my hands.
- Hey! You gotta dry 'em.

230
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,325
Thanks mom.
Ah, and the salt...

231
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:46,911
Oh! Not beans...
- What?

232
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:49,648
Only one.
- One bean?

233
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,811
Pretty neat, huh?

234
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:02,139
You wanna pork chop, Honey?
- Yes, thank you.

235
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:06,726
See? Look at your sister.
Great eating habits.

236
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,954
But she's older.

237
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:15,008
I build it for the kids in the neighborhood...

238
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:20,802
I thought they could use it as a -
kind of clubhouse, or I don't know...

239
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:25,255
You want to be the first one to try it out?

240
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,670
Really?
- Yeah, sure yeah! Go ahead. It'd be fun.

241
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,597
Go ahead.

242
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:33,816
- Corn and beans.

243
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:36,462
If you eat them both you can stay up
and watching TV with me.

244
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:38,345
Ah, neahh...

245
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,456
I'll make her a plate.

246
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,341
That's it - that's it...

247
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:04,355
Wow! This is neat-o.

248
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:11,400
She doesn't like beans, so
I'm not going to give her any.

249
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:14,762
Put more - put more on her plate.
I'm gonna make her eat them all.

250
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:17,516
Why doesn't she get to eat beans?.
- Ok, ok - I'm gonna give her beans.

251
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:19,387
They're really good.
- Ok, watch this!

252
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:21,380
That's better.
- Pile them on.

253
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:24,877
You think Popeye only eats spinach?
There's beans in that can too.

254
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:33,071
Make yourself at home.

255
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:38,587
This is really cool Mr. Harvey
- Yeah it's cool, huh?

256
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:43,083
Yeah, I thought you kids would like a
place of your own to, you know - hang out.

257
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:49,155
Here, have a seat.

258
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,642
Do you like it?
- Yeah.

259
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:02,251
You think she's still at the mall?

260
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:06,759
Yeah, probably, should be with Clarissa.
- She could've at least called.

261
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:09,832
I mean a 14 year old girl
knows how to use a telephone.

262
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:13,079
I understand, I understand.
I will deal with her when she gets home.

263
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:18,593
Check out all these little things, like
this little, you know - fluffy animals...

264
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:22,074
And some games, because I know you
kids like play games.

265
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:27,227
And candles, and little figurines.
These angels are so pretty...

266
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:37,614
Very sweet, and uh, you know -
some of these little things...

267
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,668
There you go!

268
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:44,309
It's nice with the candles
and everything, right?

269
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,864
And there is one rule.

270
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:52,650
No adults allowed!

271
00:28:57,757 --> 00:28:59,442
Ok?

272
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:09,234
That's a cute hat - I like that hat very much.

273
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,964
Would you like a refreshment Susie?

274
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:26,339
Actually I have to go.
- No, be polite.

275
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:30,683
You have to be polite.
Be polite.

276
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,452
That's another rule.

277
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:50,801
It's warm in here.

278
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:55,132
I'm warm - are you warm?

279
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,510
You can take your coat off, if you want.

280
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,882
You're very pretty, Susie.

281
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:18,221
Thanks...

282
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:24,783
Do you have a boyfriend?

283
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:35,688
No? I knew it, see... I knew you
weren't like those other girls.
I knew that.

284
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,311
Mr. Harvey?

285
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:42,491
It's nice down here, isn't it?
Special - special down here, right?

286
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:47,253
Yes - it is, it's very special.

287
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:01,229
... But I have to go.

288
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:04,455
I don't want you to leave.

289
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm not going to hurt you, Susie.

290
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:08,415
If you see her, would you please
just call? Thank you.

291
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:12,989
She's not with the Steads.
- Where are my keys?

292
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,798
Where are they?
- I don't know honey. In the bowl by the door?

293
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,959
Where you going?
Jack, could you just wait?

294
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:23,912
Jack, would you please wait for the police?

295
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:27,151
Look, stay by the phone.

296
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:37,260
Man, she's gonna be in so much trouble...

297
00:32:39,731 --> 00:32:41,734
Go back to bed, sweetie.

298
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:43,451
Ok...

299
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:50,637
Guys, this is my little girl Susie. She hasn't
come home from school - have you seen her?

300
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:52,335
- No, I ain't seen nobody.
- No?

301
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,711
Ma'am, could you take a look at this?
Have you seen this little girl?

302
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:58,567
Sorry, buddy.

303
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:02,137
Can you take a look at this please?
This is my little girl - she hasn't come home.

304
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:04,554
- I'm sorry...
Could you look at that?

305
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:08,719
Ma'am, have you seen this girl?
Please, could you just take a look?

306
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:24,939
Susan has been missing for...
what is it, four hours?

307
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:30,800
Susie, we call her Susie.
Yeah - a little more than four hours.

308
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:33,384
This is the first time she's run away?

309
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,576
She didn't run away - she's... she's missing.

310
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:39,537
Any problems at home?

311
00:33:40,546 --> 00:33:43,247
Family difficulties?

312
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:50,933
Um, no - there really are no problems.
This is a happy... she's a happy... child.

313
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:54,459
She's never done this detective, she...
- I understand that. I just have to
get a sense of...

314
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:56,661
She's not home, and she always comes home.
- of what's going on here.

315
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:00,135
There's nothing going on.
She's missing!

316
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,454
If you see her, please call me, ok?
- Sure thing, Jack.
I'll come back and see you guys in a little while.
- Take care!

317
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:07,946
Dad?

318
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:14,171
Excuse me - Sorry to interrupt you.
My name's Jack Salmon, I live right
around the corner...

319
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,760
Dad!

320
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:36,100
Dad!

321
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:40,419
Can you put together a list
of all her friends, and...

322
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,449
their names and contact information?

323
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:47,212
Uhh - a description of what she was wearing?
- Yes, of course - well actually, I could
tell you that right now,

324
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:52,149
if you want to write it down.
She was wearing a hand-knitted wool hat...

325
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:02,041
Mom, Dad!

326
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:26,282
... but she did wear pink gloves,
and she has a beige canvas school-bag.

327
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:29,991
Mom?

328
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:50,122
No!

329
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:58,911
No!

330
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,947
Secure that corner!

331
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:14,028
Jesus Christ - and tape up the rest of the
area before the whole neighborhood shows up.

332
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:17,032
Set up the ICP at the school.

333
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:22,842
What is that?

334
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:33,272
We found some evidence in the
corn field, behind the school.

335
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:37,026
There was a cavity in the earth,
a lot of debris...

336
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,727
Mostly loose woods and broken crates.

337
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:42,817
We think it's the remains
of some kind of structure.

338
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:45,433
And Susie?

339
00:38:46,898 --> 00:38:50,162
We didn't find her, Mrs. Salmon.

340
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:52,957
That's good, isn't it?

341
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:58,023
I mean, you found Susie's hat, but you didn't
find her - which means we really don't even
know if she was there at all, right?

342
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:02,121
I mean that - it's, it's preferable, right?

343
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:16,028
We also found blood.

344
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,990
A significant amount of blood.

345
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:29,488
I'm very sorry.

346
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:33,892
We'll get through this.
- How?

347
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:36,979
I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of all of us.

348
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:39,401
You can't.
- I'm gonna make it right.

349
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:41,894
You can't make this right, Jack.
You can't!

350
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:46,029
We have to find her.
I promise we will bring her home.

351
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:37,834
You have my number, or you just
come by the police station.
- Ok.

352
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,954
Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

353
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,602
Have a good day.
- You too.

354
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:31,480
Mr. Harvey?
- Yes.

355
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:34,489
Detective Len Fenerman.
- How are you doing?

356
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,877
Do you have some time for few question ?
- Certainly.

357
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,902
Come in.
- Thanks.

358
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:44,521
I know why you're here. of course
I think when something like this happens...

359
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:47,083
you always blame yourself.

360
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:53,275
All I can think about it now is,
why I didn't see something,
or why I didn't hear something because,

361
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:59,453
...because surely, that young girl
must have screamed.

362
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:04,087
Did you want one?
- No, no thanks.

363
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:08,447
But if you could just think back, I mean she
was wearing a blue jacket, yellow corduroys...

364
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:11,488
Similar clothes to these.

365
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:15,203
This blue jacket here?
- The darker blue jacket.

366
00:42:15,238 --> 00:42:18,821
And on the second photograph you can see
the pants she wore.

367
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:22,350
No, it does not ring a bell.

368
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:24,386
But you were home that day?

369
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,933
What day?
- Last Wednesday.

370
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:29,869
Last Wednesday...

371
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:50,483
Last Wednesday... Um, no - I was home all day.

372
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:55,291
I mean, I - I probably went out and ran a few
errands or something like that, but I mean, um...

373
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:59,912
I should have been here all day,
for most part.

374
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:03,475
Ok, good.
Thanks.

375
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:07,806
You married?
- I was.

376
00:43:07,873 --> 00:43:12,075
But You have kids?
- No I wish, I wish.

377
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:17,076
You mind if I take a look?
- No.

378
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:21,632
I make everything myself.

379
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:27,552
- Really?
Oh yeah, all this - I turn all the banisters
myself, make all the shingles and the furniture...

380
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:30,757
I used to do cabinet making, but there's
not much call for that these days.

381
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:35,276
Maybe I spend too much time on these things,
but that's the perfectionist in me. I guess.

382
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:37,559
All it shows.
- Thank you.

383
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:40,558
- That's amazing craftsmanship.
- Oh, well...

384
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:45,918
I took a risk and tried something new, and
discovered a talent that I didn't know I had.

385
00:43:56,344 --> 00:44:01,925
What's that underneath the stairs?
- That would be the basement.

386
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:12,151
Dad?

387
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,480
She's dead, isn't she?

388
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:35,404
<i>I was slipping away. </i>

389
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:38,296
<i>That's what it felt like.</i>

390
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:43,273
<i>Life was leaving me.</i>

391
00:44:47,258 --> 00:44:50,459
<i>But I wasn't afraid.</i>

392
00:44:53,413 --> 00:45:00,042
<i>Then I remembered, there was something
I was meant to do.</i>

393
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:04,479
<i>Somewhere I was meant to be.</i>

394
00:45:21,131 --> 00:45:23,516
Ray?

395
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:40,576
Ray!

396
00:45:44,882 --> 00:45:47,747
Ray!

397
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:02,688
Ray! Wait!

398
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:13,347
Ray!

399
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:11,629
<i>If I had but an hour of love...</i>

400
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:15,205
<i>If that be all is given me...</i>

401
00:49:15,612 --> 00:49:20,301
<i>an hour of love upon this earth...</i>

402
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:26,863
<i>I would give my love to thee.
- The Moor</i>

403
00:49:57,084 --> 00:50:01,761
Are you the Moor?
- Why?

404
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:13,276
I think this belongs to you.

405
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:22,741
Where did you get this?

406
00:50:22,776 --> 00:50:25,518
I Found it.

407
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:35,690
I write poetry.
You're quite good.

408
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:40,121
Don't you have somewhere to go?

409
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:43,826
You miss her, don't you?

410
00:50:45,987 --> 00:50:48,787
I never knew what that meant.

411
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:53,668
I used to think it meant lost. Frozen.

412
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:59,004
It means gone.
She's gone.

413
00:51:01,342 --> 00:51:04,311
What if she isn't?

414
00:51:07,158 --> 00:51:10,823
What if she's still here?

415
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,913
Help!

416
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,921
You not supposed to do that.
- What?

417
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,015
Who are you?
- She saw you, that girl.

418
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,976
I think my hand touched hers.
- Yes, that's all it takes.

419
00:51:30,982 --> 00:51:33,619
She carry you now for the rest
of her life.

420
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:37,732
You are not supposed to look back.
You are supposed to keep going.

421
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:42,456
Come back. Wait!
Who are you?

422
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:45,721
I'm Holly.
Holly go lightly.

423
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:49,528
That does not sound like a real name.
- It isn't. I borrowed it.

424
00:51:49,563 --> 00:51:52,761
You can do that up here.
- Up here?

425
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:57,137
You mean in heaven?
- (laughs) You're funny.

426
00:51:57,172 --> 00:52:01,522
What's funny about it?
- This isn't heaven, not there yet.

427
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:06,749
What is this place?
- this place is not really one place...

428
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:10,478
and, also is not the other place

429
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:14,192
it's a bit of both.

430
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:23,139
What is that?
- That's where we're going.

431
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:30,157
<i>Holly said there was a wide, wide heaven
beyond everything we knew...</i>

432
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:37,349
<i>where there was no corn field,
no memory.</i>

433
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:40,815
<i>No grave.</i>

434
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:46,347
<i>But I wasn't looking beyond yet.</i>

435
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,050
<i>I still looking back.</i>

436
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,293
You can't go back.

437
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,910
Who are you?

438
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:08,933
It's over.
Come with me.

439
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:13,469
I do not know you.
Why are you here?

440
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,573
You need to let go of Earth.

441
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:20,966
You're dead, Susie.
You have to leave.

442
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:25,280
I have to go home.

443
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,536
Dad!

444
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:26,561
<i>My murderer began to feel safe.</i>

445
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:31,811
He knew people wanted to move on.
They needed to forget.

446
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:37,986
<i>He took comfort in the thought
no one was looking at him.</i>

447
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:52,258
<i>But there was one thing my murderer
didn't understand.</i>

448
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:59,156
<i>He didn't understand how much a father
could love his child.</i>

449
00:56:35,068 --> 00:56:37,669
Dad!

450
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:15,607
It's ok.
It's gonna be ok.

451
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:20,685
He knows I'm here.
My dad knows I'm here.

452
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:25,330
I was still with him.

453
00:57:28,202 --> 00:57:33,188
I wasn't lost, or frozen, or gone.

454
00:57:33,223 --> 00:57:40,798
I was alive.
I was alive in my own perfect world.

455
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:56,445
Dad?

456
00:58:56,758 --> 00:59:00,016
I saw Susie.

457
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:05,872
She came into my room.

458
00:59:05,907 --> 00:59:08,209
She kissed me on the cheek.

459
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,771
Come here buddy.

460
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,181
I saw her too.

461
00:59:17,216 --> 00:59:22,149
Dad? I think she listens.

462
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:39,930
<i>She's used up all the film
we gave her for her birthday.
- All of it?</i>

463
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:45,397
<i>It is a crime to be creative in this family.
- Shall we pay for one roll a month?</i>

464
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:47,854
<i>One roll a month?</i>

465
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,001
I got 'em.

466
00:59:54,036 --> 00:59:57,193
Look at these - some of these are good.

467
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:04,114
Honey, why don't you get them all developed?
This 'one roll a month' thing is...

468
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:08,139
is really crazy, honey - it's crazy.
- Why?

469
01:00:08,174 --> 01:00:10,968
I mean why do we want to keep this
thing dragging out like this?

470
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:14,201
We are not dragging it out.
We made a deal.

471
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,530
There is no deal, Jack.

472
01:00:31,886 --> 01:00:34,272
Fenerman
Len, I had to call you.

473
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:37,246
Look, Susie is smart kid.
She would never go off with a stranger.

474
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:40,839
It had to be someone she knew.
Somebody local.

475
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,513
look! I've got a name for you.
I've got several names actually.

476
01:00:45,548 --> 01:00:48,457
Ronald Driver.
- Do you have an address?

477
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:53,524
Len I've got another name for you.
He's a janitor, Michael Gitchell.

478
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:58,090
There's something wrong with this one,
I'm telling you. Gary Davis.
- Who's that?

479
01:00:58,091 --> 01:01:01,385
Davis. He works at the sanitation department.
- Ok, I'll look into it.

480
01:01:01,386 --> 01:01:05,460
But I have his address right here.
Is it a bad thing If I just drive by there
and take a look myself?

481
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:10,444
Have you checked out Brent Peretti yet?
- Who?

482
01:01:10,445 --> 01:01:15,006
Peretti: P-E-R-E-T-T-I.
I have his credit report, Len.
It does not look good.

483
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:17,998
I'm on top of it, you understand?
- Len, I found another one.

484
01:01:18,098 --> 01:01:21,332
Yeah, listen - you got to trust me ok?
We gonna get this guy.

485
01:01:24,252 --> 01:01:28,264
Len, glad you're here. I was going to call you.
- Yeah, I got your messages.

486
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:30,720
I've been up to the public records office.
A lot of stuff to go over here...

487
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,123
I know you're looking at the obvious suspects -

488
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,597
Convicted felons, child molesters,
and I understand why, but Len...

489
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:38,841
I think you're coming at it
from the wrong angle.

490
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,502
Honey.
- Herman Stolefis, just across the street...

491
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,281
Now he appears to be perfectly normal, but Len...

492
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:46,505
The man wears adults diapers.

493
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:49,605
Herman is 80 years old.
- I followed him to the supermarket.

494
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:53,018
His shopping cart was filled with them.
- He has a prostate problem.

495
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:57,269
My point is - we need to stop looking backward.
We need to start looking at family histories.

496
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:02,011
Criminal records, mental health issues...
- Jack, this doesn't change anything!

497
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:05,831
Did I mention taxes? Len, you can tell
a lot about a person from taxes.

498
01:02:05,832 --> 01:02:10,054
Please will you just stop it now?
Will you just stop!
Can't you just leave it alone?

499
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:19,244
Jack, I know it's been 11 months. I know you've
been trying to deal with this in your own way
but...

500
01:02:20,725 --> 01:02:24,859
She's not coping very well.
She needs help, Jack.

501
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:29,169
She needs someone to help her
get through this.

502
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,345
Grandma is here! Grandma!
Grandma is here!

503
01:02:39,577 --> 01:02:43,197
What's my mother here?
- Look, you're not coping, ok?

504
01:02:43,198 --> 01:02:46,479
Len's worried, I'm worried,
your mother offered to help.

505
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,477
You invited her here?

506
01:02:48,478 --> 01:02:49,637
- Darling.

507
01:02:49,737 --> 01:02:54,366
Hello, mother.
- Look at you! Are you eating?

508
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:58,235
Is this all of it?
- Don't be ridiculous! That's just my make-up.

509
01:02:58,236 --> 01:03:03,420
Oh, you're as handsome as Hell, Jack.
- Lindsey, honey, are you going to say hello?

510
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:09,142
The child hates me.
So, What will it be, Jack?

511
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:13,390
Actually, I'm not drinking these days.
- Ah, that's your problem in a nutshell.

512
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:18,883
Are we still a family?
- Of course we're a family!

513
01:03:18,884 --> 01:03:21,349
Your mother's in crisis,
your father's a wreck.

514
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,969
What does that make you?

515
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,903
I'm in charge.

516
01:04:45,672 --> 01:04:48,896
He walked through the woods, looking
for rabbits.

517
01:04:48,897 --> 01:04:53,600
Then he sees three. He grabs his gun,
looks and aims.

518
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:57,000
And then, a giant puff of smoke -
he doesn't see them any more...

519
01:04:57,001 --> 01:05:03,410
Then he realizes that his gun,
it was out of bullets. Then he runs.

520
01:05:48,506 --> 01:05:51,462
You're the Salmon girl, right?
Ok.... O-k!

521
01:06:05,437 --> 01:06:06,578
Holiday!

522
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:19,883
Grandma, I know where Susie is.

523
01:06:19,918 --> 01:06:25,639
Yeah, Susie is gone to heaven, sweetheart.
- Lindsey said there is no heaven.

524
01:06:25,674 --> 01:06:28,942
alright then, she's dead.

525
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:33,397
You might be dead soon.
- Why do you say that?

526
01:06:33,398 --> 01:06:36,027
Because you're old.

527
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:39,904
35 is not old. You've been sniffing
too much of that polish.

528
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:44,460
And anyway, nothing's going to happen to me.
You know why?

529
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:50,082
Because I take my medicine, everyday.

530
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:56,423
Grandma, she's here.

531
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:58,737
What?
- Susie.

532
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:02,610
Susie's in the in-between.

533
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:21,354
I was in the blue horizon, between
heaven and earth.

534
01:07:22,723 --> 01:07:25,619
<i>The days were unchanging.</i>

535
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:29,862
<i>And every night, I dreamed
the same dream.</i>

536
01:07:32,103 --> 01:07:37,447
<i>The smell of damp earth.
The scream that no one heard.</i>

537
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:44,000
<i>The sound of my heart beating,
like a hammer against cloth.</i>

538
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:53,337
<i>And I would hear them calling.
The voices of the dead.</i>

539
01:07:56,414 --> 01:07:59,874
<i>I wanted to follow them.
To find a way out.</i>

540
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:04,934
<i>But I would always come back
to the same door.</i>

541
01:08:07,221 --> 01:08:09,774
<i>And I was afraid.</i>

542
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:16,677
<i>I knew if I went in there...</i>

543
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:19,521
<i>I would never come out.</i>

544
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:29,740
<i>My murderer could live in
one moment for a long time.</i>

545
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:34,992
<i>He could feed off the memory
over, and over again.</i>

546
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:40,323
<i>He was animal.
Faceless.</i>

547
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:43,193
<i>Infinite.</i>

548
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:48,382
<i>But then he would feel it.
The emptiness returning.</i>

549
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:52,974
<i>And the need would
rise in him again.</i>

550
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:02,967
Go.
- Here in?

551
01:09:02,968 --> 01:09:07,622
<i>When summer came, he noticed young
lovers would sneak into the cornfield.</i>

552
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:12,233
<i>He began to follow them, and watch.</i>

553
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:31,108
Will you come to bed?

554
01:09:32,144 --> 01:09:35,057
Yeah, soon.

555
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:58,797
Ohh, Buckley did this, right?
- Correct, he said that this is our house...

556
01:09:58,798 --> 01:10:02,915
This is the police station, and that's you.
- That's me?
Mmm hmm!

557
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:06,436
Yeah, he made you chief of police, so...
- I've gained 20 pounds.

558
01:10:06,437 --> 01:10:09,767
That must be, uh - the uniform.
- The dangers of a desk job.

559
01:10:13,769 --> 01:10:18,102
Why don't you have a seat..?

560
01:10:24,155 --> 01:10:26,599
<i>I'm living with this every day!
- What about your marriage?</i>

561
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,161
<i>What marriage!?
Jack is sleeping in the study!</i>

562
01:10:30,162 --> 01:10:33,583
<i>You have to find a way to keep going.
- Mother!
You don't have a choice!</i>

563
01:10:33,584 --> 01:10:36,137
<i>- I am coping with this!
If you can't give up. you have to...</i>

564
01:10:36,138 --> 01:10:41,311
<i>Ah, bingo!
That is cooking Sherry! Please - Please!
- You have to find a way to live with this.</i>

565
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:46,597
<i>Live with it!? I am living with this!
- No, no - You're not!
I am dealing! I'm coping!</i>

566
01:10:46,598 --> 01:10:48,519
<i>I'm dealing with it. So what?</i>

567
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,882
<i>You have a tomb in the middle of your
house!</i>

568
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:58,578
Oh sweetheart, do you really think if you
seal it up, that the pain's gonna go away?

569
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:06,449
<i>My mother went as far away as she could.</i>

570
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:10,215
<i>She found a job at a small orchard
outside of Santa Rosa.</i>

571
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:14,073
<i>The work was hard, but
she didn't mind.</i>

572
01:12:14,653 --> 01:12:19,539
<i>If anyone asked, she said
she had two children.</i>

573
01:12:20,264 --> 01:12:22,962
Dearest Lindsey...

574
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:40,580
<i>And Lindsey, who always said
she didn't believe in love...</i>

575
01:12:42,142 --> 01:12:45,030
<i>found it anyway.</i>

576
01:13:07,118 --> 01:13:11,530
<i>And there it was. The moment
I would never have.</i>

577
01:13:13,544 --> 01:13:17,155
<i>My little sister had run ahead of me.</i>

578
01:13:17,156 --> 01:13:20,732
<i>She was growing up.</i>

579
01:13:23,947 --> 01:13:26,783
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be happy.

580
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:30,424
I am happy.

581
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:35,141
I'm very happy.

582
01:13:35,142 --> 01:13:37,688
Why are you crying?

583
01:13:38,244 --> 01:13:44,487
No - you think she did not want to kiss him?
- No, she did.

584
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:49,572
She wanted to kiss him very much.

585
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:05,850
<i>Always, I would watch Ray.</i>

586
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:09,506
<i>I was in the air around him.</i>

587
01:14:09,507 --> 01:14:14,165
<i>I was in the cold winter mornings
he spent with Ruth Conners.</i>

588
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:17,977
<i>That strange, other-worldly girl...</i>

589
01:14:17,978 --> 01:14:23,566
<i>who so easily accepted the presence
of the dead among the living.</i>

590
01:14:28,316 --> 01:14:32,953
<i>And sometimes, Ray would think of me.</i>

591
01:14:32,954 --> 01:14:38,638
<i>But he began to wonder, maybe it was
time to put that memory away.</i>

592
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:43,789
Maybe it was time to let me go.

593
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,706
Lindsey, throw it!

594
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:15,630
Missing girl, Susie Salmon and
sister Lindsey Salmon (right)

595
01:15:50,182 --> 01:15:53,354
<i>My Murderer had finely tuned instincts.</i>

596
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:59,951
<i>He knew my sister had begun to wonder about
the solitary man who lived in the green house.</i>

597
01:16:02,127 --> 01:16:05,584
<i>She seemed intent on crowding him.</i>

598
01:16:05,585 --> 01:16:08,528
<i>And he resented it.</i>

599
01:16:26,328 --> 01:16:30,767
<i>He began to feel a familiar itch.</i>

600
01:17:30,581 --> 01:17:33,531
Mom, look!
- Just a second.

601
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:46,665
Careful, honey.
- Mom!

602
01:17:53,597 --> 01:17:56,873
<i>Really, that is a beautiful smell...</i>

603
01:19:21,307 --> 01:19:23,312
Mom, look!

604
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:26,905
Hey Dad! Look at me!

605
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:44,679
Oh - Mr. Salmon, hi.

606
01:20:48,415 --> 01:20:49,818
What is that?

607
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:53,651
- Oh, it's just a project I'm working on.

608
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:57,456
You're a hunter?
- Ducks.

609
01:20:59,513 --> 01:21:00,955
That's a blind right?

610
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,109
Yeah.
- So those things really work?

611
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:07,225
Oh yeah.

612
01:21:07,226 --> 01:21:11,880
It's all about concealment,
the art of concealment.

613
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:15,772
And patience. Takes a lot of patience.

614
01:21:15,773 --> 01:21:20,521
Sit for hours on end in the dark.
I'm an outdoors man.

615
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:23,402
Always have been.

616
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:48,366
Mr. Salmon?

617
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:57,179
I just, um... I never got a chance to
tell how sorry I am about your loss.

618
01:22:23,224 --> 01:22:25,456
<i>Dad...</i>

619
01:22:45,038 --> 01:22:49,854
Here, let me help you.
- Oh no, that's alright. Really, I can manage.

620
01:22:49,889 --> 01:22:52,904
No, it's no trouble.

621
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,630
Alright, I appreciate it.

622
01:23:02,915 --> 01:23:06,144
Dad, look!
- This is for you.

623
01:23:06,145 --> 01:23:09,651
Mr. Harvey, you really shouldn't...
You are welcome.

624
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:12,195
That's a beautiful smell.

625
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:15,801
Hey, look at me!
- Careful, honey.

626
01:23:23,382 --> 01:23:26,376
Oh, that really does smell...

627
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:29,672
Delicious.
- Beautiful, yeah.

628
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:33,276
Dad!
(Isn't that something...)

629
01:23:33,277 --> 01:23:36,072
Hey Dad, look at me!

630
01:24:01,772 --> 01:24:04,846
I think it's time for you to
go home now, Mr. Salmon.

631
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:18,463
Go on home.

632
01:24:25,263 --> 01:24:29,492
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

633
01:24:31,935 --> 01:24:37,536
What did you do to her!?
What did you do to MY DAUGHTER!?

634
01:24:38,485 --> 01:24:42,334
It's gotta stop, Jack! You came this
close to getting arrested tonight!

635
01:24:42,335 --> 01:24:45,155
You're lucky George Harvey
declined to press charges!

636
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:46,759
Lucky?

637
01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:49,404
Your father put a hole in the man's back door.

638
01:24:49,405 --> 01:24:51,541
Yeah, he should have put a hole in his head!
- Lindsey, please!

639
01:24:51,576 --> 01:24:54,675
Did you hear that, Jack?
This is the example you're setting for your kids!

640
01:24:54,775 --> 01:24:56,972
Persecuting the neighbors!
- He is not crazy!

641
01:24:57,072 --> 01:24:59,502
I didn't say that.
- Well then why won't you listen to him?

642
01:24:59,602 --> 01:25:01,959
Because you need evidence, Lindsey.

643
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,534
You can't go around, making accusations against
George Harvey when you have no evidence!

644
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:09,762
You need proof!
- You are pathetic.

645
01:25:09,763 --> 01:25:14,750
Why can't you just admit it?
You stopped looking for her, a long time ago.

646
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:18,695
Len's right. He's right.

647
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:22,636
It's time to put this behind us.
It's gone on too long.

648
01:25:23,615 --> 01:25:26,357
This has to stop.
- Dad...

649
01:25:26,358 --> 01:25:29,588
Things will take their
natural course, Lindsey.

650
01:25:29,589 --> 01:25:34,214
Len, I appreciate everything you've done.
You've been a great friend to me.

651
01:25:37,907 --> 01:25:40,648
That goes for Abigail, too.

652
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:44,215
You've been a great friend to both of us.

653
01:26:28,404 --> 01:26:30,996
<i>Murder changes everything.</i>

654
01:26:40,918 --> 01:26:44,475
<i>When I was alive, I never hated anyone.</i>

655
01:26:44,977 --> 01:26:48,918
<i>But now hate, was all that I had.</i>

656
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:52,212
<i>I want him dead.</i>

657
01:26:52,213 --> 01:26:57,564
<i>I want him cold and dead,
with no blood in his veins!</i>

658
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:04,767
Look at me!

659
01:27:04,768 --> 01:27:08,386
Look at what he did to me!

660
01:27:08,387 --> 01:27:11,674
<i>What am I now? The dead girl?</i>

661
01:27:11,675 --> 01:27:15,130
<i>The lost girl? The missing girl?</i>

662
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:18,114
I'm nothing!

663
01:27:49,271 --> 01:27:51,834
I was stupid.

664
01:27:52,275 --> 01:27:57,195
I was so stupid!
- You don't control this, Susie.

665
01:28:13,137 --> 01:28:16,197
He does not own you.

666
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:20,449
You can be free of him. But not this way.

667
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:24,026
What do you know? You don't know anything!

668
01:28:24,027 --> 01:28:27,704
That man took my life!

669
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:34,303
You will see, Susie.
In the end, you will understand.

670
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:39,494
Everyone dies.

671
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:04,557
Brian!
- Don't worry. Go, go..

672
01:29:04,558 --> 01:29:06,412
Ok, ok. Ha ha!

673
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,739
<i>Dad?</i>

674
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:26,477
<i>Dad!</i>

675
01:29:26,478 --> 01:29:29,787
<i>Dad!..
I realized what I had done.</i>

676
01:29:29,788 --> 01:29:32,927
<i>I willed him to stop.</i>

677
01:29:39,447 --> 01:29:42,149
<i>I willed him to turn back.</i>

678
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:51,621
I know it's you!
Come out!

679
01:29:52,064 --> 01:29:54,841
Come out and face me!

680
01:29:54,842 --> 01:29:57,877
Did you hear me, you son of a bitch!?

681
01:30:03,468 --> 01:30:06,969
Go off me!
- Sick fuck!

682
01:30:08,007 --> 01:30:12,620
Brian, stop it!

683
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:16,913
Brian, stop!

684
01:30:16,914 --> 01:30:19,767
Brian, stop it!
- You wanna touch my girl!?

685
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:24,270
Dad!

686
01:30:26,016 --> 01:30:28,777
Dad!

687
01:30:31,381 --> 01:30:34,129
No!
- Brian, stop!

688
01:30:37,188 --> 01:30:40,912
Brian - stop! Stop!

689
01:30:41,382 --> 01:30:44,668
<i>Don't you get it - you killed him!</i>

690
01:30:46,556 --> 01:30:49,532
He's dead! He's dead...
- Go, go!

691
01:30:49,533 --> 01:30:51,571
Go!

692
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:22,229
<i>I knew then, he would never give me up.</i>

693
01:32:23,143 --> 01:32:27,195
<i>He would never count me as one of the
dead.</i>

694
01:32:29,793 --> 01:32:32,970
<i>I was his daughter.</i>

695
01:32:32,971 --> 01:32:36,358
<i>And he was my dad.</i>

696
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:40,311
<i>And he had loved me, as much as he could.</i>

697
01:32:42,842 --> 01:32:45,821
<i>I had to let him go.</i>

698
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:22,855
Sophie Cichetti, Pennsylvania.

She had just turned 13. Her body
was found in a drainage ditch...

702
01:34:58,886 --> 01:35:02,154
by the side of the road.

703
01:35:05,779 --> 01:35:09,712

<i>She was lured into a shack,
he had built of old doors.</i>

708
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:39,611
<i>She was the youngest.
She was six.</i>

709
01:35:52,824 --> 01:35:57,300
<i>Flora Hernandez.

710
01:35:57,301 --> 01:36:01,929

<i>Denise Li-Ang,

712
01:36:17,232 --> 01:36:23,724
<i>13. She was waiting for her father to
close up their shop, when she vanished.</i>

713
01:36:23,725 --> 01:36:30,263
<i>Denise Li-Ang, who sometimes
liked to be called Holly.</i>

714
01:37:56,801 --> 01:38:03,437
<i>Susie Salmon, 14.

Come on, guys. Keep up!

717
01:39:05,803 --> 01:39:07,304
Are you OK. Lindsey?
- Go on.

718
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:09,071
You sure?
-I'm fine, Go.

719
01:39:09,072 --> 01:39:11,358
Catch up?

720
01:46:30,966 --> 01:46:33,327
Dad!

721
01:46:33,914 --> 01:46:36,551
Where's Dad?

722
01:46:45,242 --> 01:46:48,170
Mom.

723
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:56,171
What are you doing here?
- What does it matter. She is home.

724
01:46:57,964 --> 01:47:01,023
Home for Good?
- Of course she's home for good.

725
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:06,782
Where's Buckley?
- He's at Soccer practice, and
I have to pick him up in an hour.

726
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:43,879
My girl.
- Jack.

727
01:48:09,742 --> 01:48:13,688
Look at you!
What happened?

728
01:48:43,914 --> 01:48:46,938
No, no, no.
No - you're too late!

729
01:48:47,353 --> 01:48:50,955
We're closed.
- Oh, you're closed, huh?

730
01:48:50,956 --> 01:48:53,296
Yeah.

731
01:48:53,297 --> 01:48:55,998
Oh.. Too bad - I was really hoping
to get rid of this thing.

732
01:48:56,098 --> 01:49:01,021
Sorry, pal. We're fillin' her in.
- Oh, you're filling her in, huh?

733
01:49:01,022 --> 01:49:06,406
- Yep.
Oh, yeah, well.. I really hate to
inconvenience you, but...

734
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:15,447
Would you like some help?
- Yeah, sure. That would be great.

735
01:50:24,091 --> 01:50:27,419
I come here almost every day.

736
01:50:28,752 --> 01:50:32,773
I like to listen to the sounds.

737
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:38,537
Have you seen Holly?
- Did she tell you about this place?

738
01:50:39,771 --> 01:50:42,702
Yes.

739
01:50:43,730 --> 01:50:48,772
Then you must be ready.
I'm Flora Hernandez.

740
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:54,240
The others will be here soon.

741
01:51:02,358 --> 01:51:04,828
Who is that?
- I don't know.

742
01:51:04,829 --> 01:51:09,282
But he gives me the skeevies.
- The skeevies? why? Are you 12?

743
01:53:07,608 --> 01:53:09,508
It's beautiful.

744
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:13,729
Of course it's beautiful.

745
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:16,909
It's heaven!

746
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:42,795
Yeah, c'mon - let's go.

747
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:51,321
What are you waiting for?
You're free!

748
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:00,116
Almost.

749
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:03,182
Not quite.

750
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,709
Ray!

751
01:54:22,684 --> 01:54:23,515
Ray!

752
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:55,205
Ruth!

753
01:54:55,967 --> 01:54:58,505
What happened?

754
01:55:05,598 --> 01:55:08,547
What's wrong?

755
01:55:15,972 --> 01:55:17,269
Ruth?

756
01:55:39,733 --> 01:55:42,160
Susie!?

757
01:55:44,645 --> 01:55:47,892
You wrote me a poem once.

758
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:53,816
You called yourself 'The Moor'.

759
01:56:02,645 --> 01:56:05,558
That's good, I got it from here.

760
01:56:19,285 --> 01:56:21,636
Kiss me.

761
01:57:26,772 --> 01:57:29,985
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

762
01:57:51,008 --> 01:57:55,926
<i>These were the lovely bones,
that had grown around my absence.</i>

763
01:57:57,603 --> 01:58:01,909
<i>The connections sometimes tenuous.</i>

764
01:58:02,769 --> 01:58:06,223
<i>Sometimes made at great cost.</i>

765
01:58:06,224 --> 01:58:09,930
<i>But often, magnificent.</i>

766
01:58:10,624 --> 01:58:15,437
<i>That happened, after I was gone.</i>

767
01:58:16,681 --> 01:58:19,558
<i>And I began to see things in a way...</i>

768
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:27,028
<i>that let me hold the world, without me in
it.</i>

769
01:58:44,704 --> 01:58:47,345
Brrr - it's a cold night!

770
01:58:53,115 --> 01:58:56,141
You looking for a ride?

771
01:58:56,747 --> 01:58:59,062
No.

772
01:58:59,508 --> 01:59:02,063
No?

773
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:06,004
Are you sure? It's pretty cold out here.

774
01:59:07,219 --> 01:59:10,479
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

775
01:59:12,564 --> 01:59:15,883
What do you think?
- Look, mister...

776
01:59:15,884 --> 01:59:21,354
I'm not interested, ok?
- I'm not trying do nothing.
Just trying to be polite.

777
01:59:21,745 --> 01:59:24,856
That's all.

778
01:59:24,857 --> 01:59:27,249
A young lady, alone at night.
Not safe -

779
01:59:27,349 --> 01:59:30,670
Didn't you hear me?
Piss off!

780
02:00:28,431 --> 02:00:32,664
<i>When my mother came to my room,
I realized that...</i>

781
02:00:32,665 --> 02:00:36,488
<i>all this time, I had been waiting for
her.</i>

782
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:41,561
<i>I had been waiting so long...</i>

783
02:00:41,562 --> 02:00:45,177
<i>I was afraid she wouldn't come.</i>

784
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:51,088
I love you, Susie.

785
02:01:01,344 --> 02:01:03,522
<i>Nobody notices when me leave.</i>

786
02:01:03,523 --> 02:01:08,907
<i>I mean, the moment when we really chose to
go.</i>

787
02:01:08,908 --> 02:01:14,148
<i>At best you might feel a whisper -
or, the wave of a whisper...</i>

788
02:01:14,149 --> 02:01:17,529
<i>undulating down.</i>

789
02:01:18,885 --> 02:01:22,393
<i>My name is Salmon. Like the fish.</i>

790
02:01:22,394 --> 02:01:26,074
<i>First name, Susie.</i>

791
02:01:26,075 --> 02:01:34,494
<i>I was 14 years old when I was murdered,
on December 6, 1973.</i>

792
02:01:36,164 --> 02:01:40,311
<i>I was here for a moment.</i>

793
02:01:40,312 --> 02:01:43,624
<i>And then I was gone.</i>

794
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:49,534
<i>I wish you all a long, and happy life.</i>
