2
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,466
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

3
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,503
Come on!
Come on, come on.

4
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:17,706
Fuck! Move, move,
move! Get the door!

5
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,709
Shit!

6
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,544
Shut the fucking door!

7
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,808
- Florek! Florek!
- I'm okay!

8
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,543
- I'm okay!
- Gotta keep him awake.

9
00:01:57,545 --> 00:01:58,679
Get us out of here,
Harry!

10
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,113
You said
this was handled!

11
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:01,381
You said this was handled!

12
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:03,316
Kick that fucking door off!

13
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:04,519
Shit.

14
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:07,723
Damn it!

15
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:09,523
Come on, come on, come on!

16
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,093
Shit!

17
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,696
Fuck.

18
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:22,101
I want my money.

19
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:23,636
"I want my money."

20
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:24,771
I thought it was our money.

21
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:27,442
It's my store, Carlos.
My store.

22
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,510
Every time I give you a loan,

23
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,546
it's like an IOU,
but this is a new low.

24
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:34,481
What, you accusing me
of stealing your money?

25
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:35,614
Why do you
look surprised?

26
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,149
You do it for a living.

27
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,485
Where you get the balls?

28
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,654
What I do for this family.
I risk my life.

29
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:42,221
Yeah. You risk your life

30
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:43,959
and then
you piss it up a wall.

31
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:45,994
<i>Mija,</i> come here.

32
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:47,763
I love you. Huh?

33
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:50,032
Listen to your mother
even though she crazy. Huh?

34
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,165
She's always crazy.

35
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,799
Always crazy.

36
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,971
Come here.

37
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:58,339
- I love you.
- Always true.

38
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:00,307
Always true.

39
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:01,808
Just let me out!
Let me out!

40
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,077
No way.
We're sticking to the plan.

41
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,724
You should eat something.

42
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:20,897
Does that hurt? That?

43
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,031
Hmm?

44
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:24,866
Boop.

45
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,901
Boop, boop.

46
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:28,868
You need to do
something with makeup.

47
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,203
Makes me feel bad
to look at that.

48
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:32,125
It makes me feel bad, too.

49
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:38,747
Come here. I love you.

50
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,682
<i>...today with your</i>

51
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,083
<i>forecast for the Windy City.</i>

52
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:45,652
<i>Hi, I'm Christine Dawn.</i>

53
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:46,986
<i>Winds are going
to continue to be</i>

54
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,721
<i>out of the north

55
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:51,857
<i>...at 28Â°, and that westerly
wind direction for your...</i>

56
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:52,860
Breakfast?

57
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:55,697
Gotta run.

58
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,464
Let's get in the other van.

59
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,166
We'll fix him at home.
Let's go!

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,873
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

61
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,644
Come on!

62
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:10,743
That's it.

63
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:17,918
What the fuck?

64
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,825
Most people don't know
what an alderman does...

65
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:02,596
including a fair number
of aldermen.

66
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:07,369
It comes from the Old English,
meaning "older man."

67
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,570
When I was a younger man,
Facebook...

68
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:12,139
Back then,
a face was something

69
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:13,806
you tried never to forget.

70
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,911
A book?

71
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:20,914
A book was something you read
to your son. My son, Jack.

72
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,649
Stand up, Jack. Stand up.

73
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:23,685
My son.

74
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:27,656
The best candidate for
alderman of the 18th ward.

75
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:30,860
He's your man. Believe me.

76
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:51,678
What, you can't speak?

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,079
Yo, could I get
a piece of that?

78
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,515
Gotta get a loan, player.

79
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,351
I got good credit.
What's up?

80
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,288
Whatever.

81
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:06,862
Mr. Mulligan.

82
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,063
- Mr. Manning.
- Hmm.

83
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:10,166
My aide, Siobhan.

84
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:12,298
- This is my brother.
- Jatemme.

85
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,301
I love you, too.

86
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,404
As a kid, I used to help out
with my dad's campaign.

87
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:19,772
It looked a lot like this.

88
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:20,839
Except a little whiter,

89
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,175
- I imagine.
- Yeah.

90
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,444
- Mind?
- Please do.

91
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:25,846
My father always thought
it was a good idea

92
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:26,913
to keep the lines
of communication

93
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:28,048
open with his opponent.

94
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,750
Keep things honest, dignified.

95
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:32,152
Maybe he could be
more honest and open

96
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:33,919
about whatever deal he made
with the city council

97
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,755
to call this special election
instead of waiting

98
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,556
until February
like the law says.

99
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:38,793
He had to step down.

100
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,592
He had a heart attack.

101
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:41,827
Who does waiting serve?

102
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,729
Everyone who's
not named Mulligan.

103
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,731
First time
I've run for office.

104
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,933
I'm already ahead of you
by 12 points in the polls.

105
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,003
The Mulligans have run
the 18th ward for 60 years.

106
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,171
My grandfather, my father.

107
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,716
These days it's
all about name recognition.

108
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,140
You wanna go against me?

109
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,308
You don't inherit
a ward, Jack.

110
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,344
You run for it.

111
00:06:58,012 --> 00:06:59,532
You have much experience
in government?

112
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,714
- I live here.
- So do I.

113
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,916
No, no, no.

114
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,786
You, uh, own a house one block
into the ward.

115
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:09,289
A house people might actually
want to live in.

116
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,490
It's a smart idea.

117
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,093
Running headquarters
from a church.

118
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:14,127
I mean, it's illegal.

119
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,965
There's that whole
church and state thing.

120
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,432
More illegal than nepotism?

121
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,334
Nepotism isn't illegal.

122
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:21,303
It's actually celebrated.
This is Chicago.

123
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,437
Your daddy can put you
on some commission

124
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,639
where people
don't have no say.

125
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,440
Let you be a big boy,
play with a few trains, but...

126
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,140
Extending the Green Line
is the best thing

127
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:29,976
for the people
of the 18th ward.

128
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:32,378
Brings them closer to jobs,
closer to culture.

129
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,046
Those people
don't seem to be the ones

130
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,615
getting rich though, Jack.

131
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:36,849
What about you, Jamal?

132
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:38,717
What have you been doing
to improve the lives

133
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,920
of the people of Chicago?

134
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,022
I bet your reputation's
a real problem

135
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:43,184
for your communications team.

136
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,493
Maybe you the one who need
the communications team.

137
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,062
I've never been arrested.

138
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:50,733
Let's see if you can say that
a few months from now.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
If you pull out now,
you can save yourself

140
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:55,771
some money,
ton of embarrassment.

141
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,637
Come on, Jack,
I don't pull out

142
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,738
when it feels this good.

143
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,305
Right?

144
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,341
All right. Don't forget
to vote on August 8th.

145
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:05,445
Absolutely. Hey. the election
is on the 7th, Jack.

146
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,448
Oh, I know.

147
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:16,757
Why you wanna go
into politics anyway, man?

148
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:20,125
Passing bills and shit.
Whatever the fuck they do.

149
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:23,161
Alderman of this ward
makes a $104,000 a year.

150
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:25,098
Shit, we make
more than that in a week.

151
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,069
But then you add in
the juice, right?

152
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:28,734
He gives his friend
a contract

153
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:30,437
for a new building,
gets a kickback.

154
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,272
Gives his brother a contract
for construction.

155
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:34,274
Hell, he give his mama
a contract for construction.

156
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,779
That man owns a piece
of every fucking thing.

157
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:39,646
The only people
coming after him,

158
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,046
they got cameras
and microphones.

159
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,717
People coming after us
with guns.

160
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:46,221
I'm 37 years old, Jatemme.
I don't want this life no more.

161
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,823
I want his fucking life.

162
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,592
Harry Rawlings is dead.

163
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,461
What that
gotta do with us?

164
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:56,896
Hey, what?

165
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,367
He took
our money with him.

166
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,412
Medical examiner
say he can still ID them?

167
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:12,447
I think off the teeth maybe?

168
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,717
I always said
he should burn in hell.

169
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,387
But, hey, Chicago'll do.

170
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,528
<i>He who admonishes
the young to live well</i>

171
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,364
and the old to make good end
speaks foolishly,

172
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,166
not merely because of
the desirability of life,

173
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:43,170
but because
the same exercise at once

174
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,939
teaches us to live well
and to die well.

175
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,740
Much worse is he who says

176
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,943
that it were good
not to be born,

177
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:53,045
but once one is born
to pass with all speed

178
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:54,479
through the gates of Hades.

179
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:01,253
He was
so beautiful, wasn't he?

180
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:04,824
His eyes. He got away with
so much because of those eyes.

181
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,057
I know, I know.

182
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,295
Because they
didn't let me see the body.

183
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:10,499
I couldn't say goodbye
properly, Ma.

184
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:12,699
I wanna see it.

185
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:17,206
I promise you, Alitzia,
you don't wanna see his body.

186
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,041
What's left of it.

187
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,460
Would you like something to eat?

188
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,940
Something to drink, then?

189
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
I don't want anything from you.

190
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,520
You're the reason I'm here...

191
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,100
and Carlos isn't

192
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,320
He got into the life on his own.

193
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,280
He did if for you.

194
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,520
Before you, he was going to college.

195
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,320
His blood is on your hands.

196
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,805
What do you think
of my new painting?

197
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:26,873
What?

198
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,940
The artist
is really blowing up.

199
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:31,676
I got in early,
got it for 50,000. Drink?

200
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:32,680
Yeah.

201
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,284
To the masterpiece.

202
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:40,655
Yeah, so...

203
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,225
Did you get him to concede?

204
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,494
Go back to his
normal business?

205
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:47,395
Now, let me
tell you something.

206
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:50,632
I don't wanna see you
become the first Mulligan...

207
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:52,233
to lose to a nigger.

208
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,370
Especially this guy.
He's tricky.

209
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,035
Okay?

210
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:57,338
He's staying in.

211
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,738
- But it's fine.
- Okay?

212
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,375
Yeah. It's dealt with.

213
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,075
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

214
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:03,779
Dealt with? What do you mean,
"dealt with"?

215
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:05,545
Maybe you shouldn't have been
such a hard-ass.

216
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:06,746
Now, if you'd have
just rolled over

217
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,359
for the mayor
on that housing development...

218
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,652
I don't roll over for anybody!

219
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:12,387
Okay?

220
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:15,887
- He had his agenda, I had mine.
- Look where that's got us.

221
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,169
The lines of the ward
are redrawn

222
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,528
and we're down 7,000 votes
that would've gone our way.

223
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:22,965
You created this problem.

224
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:26,031
Now we might be left
without a pot to piss in.

225
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,301
Oh, says the man
with the $50,000

226
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:30,639
piece of wallpaper.

227
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,640
It's art.

228
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,710
It's wallpaper.

229
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:36,310
Art.

230
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,212
Wallpaper.

231
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,124
Whole time caught the niggas
in the back rapping.

232
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:58,527
They cold though, Ja.

233
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,128
Hey, man, it wasn't our fault.

234
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:03,829
They knew where we were
gonna be. That shit was a setup.

235
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,430
They had to be professionals
or some shit.

236
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:06,699
You let
Harry Rawlings

237
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,167
get away with our money.

238
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:09,770
No, that's not what I'm...

239
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:20,548
I wanna hear what you were
doing. Do it again.

240
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,285
Hmm?

241
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,521
Your music. Hmm?

242
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,125
I'm not kidding. Do it again.

243
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,461
All right,
let's get it.

244
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,237
Run.

245
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:20,875
Take care of this.

246
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:39,794
Is everything taken care of?

247
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,763
Yes, ma'am,
I got the roses you wanted.

248
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:46,033
They got three
different dove gray caskets.

249
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:49,004
You'd be surprised how much
they want for those things.

250
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:51,369
You wanna guess how much?

251
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:53,641
No, no, I don't.
I just wanna go.

252
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:57,209
Harry said if anything
happened to him,

253
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:58,513
I should give this to you.

254
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:00,581
When?

255
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:03,619
Uh...

256
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,921
Honestly, I don't remember.

257
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,357
I don't remember
things too good.

258
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:15,061
<i>Then he will
see you face to face</i>

259
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:16,930
and in your light will see light

260
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:19,231
and know the splendor of God.

261
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:22,067
For you live and reign
forever and ever. Amen.

262
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,271
Amen.

263
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,774
Harry Rawlings.

264
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:01,976
He never messed with me,
I never messed with him.

265
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:05,346
We in different games.
I always had respect.

266
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,180
So why'd he hit me now?

267
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:08,316
Oh, I know why.

268
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,882
He thinks
you're setting your sights

269
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,054
on something higher,
you're getting sloppy.

270
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:15,354
Mrs. Rawlings,
I'm Jack Mulligan.

271
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:16,421
I had the privilege of working

272
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:18,090
with your husband
a couple of times.

273
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,458
He was a wonderful man.

274
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,059
I'm so sorry for your loss.

275
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,696
If there's anything I can do,
please don't hesitate to ask.

276
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,430
I'm not a hard man to find.

277
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,602
- Thank you.
- God bless.

278
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:45,450
Harry wouldn't have liked it.
The backhoe.

279
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:47,422
Should've hired gravediggers.

280
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,759
I don't think they have
gravediggers anymore.

281
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,427
I want you
to give me the names

282
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:56,398
of all the men
that died with Harry.

283
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,230
Who is it?

284
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,433
<i>Mrs. Rawlings,
my name is Jamal Manning.</i>

285
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,038
<i>I'm a friend of Harry's.</i>

286
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,805
Evening, Mrs. Rawlings.
My name is Jamal Manning.

287
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,306
I'm running for alderman
of the 18th ward.

288
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:49,440
This is not the 18th ward.

289
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:50,910
Yes, but I'd like
to have a word with you

290
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,277
to discuss some
urgent matters if you...

291
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,347
No.

292
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,646
It's not the 18th ward!
Get out!

293
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:57,650
Come here, little fella.

294
00:20:57,652 --> 00:20:59,219
Because I didn't know
your husband.

295
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:01,823
I didn't know your husband,
not really. Mm-mm.

296
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,392
But he stole
two million dollars from me.

297
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,459
He stole it...
right out of a van

298
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:09,029
like he knew
where it would be.

299
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,496
I just wanna know why.

300
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:17,702
I'm not involved in my
husband's business at all

301
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:19,640
and I don't know
why you're here.

302
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,577
It'll only take
a moment to discuss.

303
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,413
Oh, yes.

304
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:32,921
Mama's got a big house, yeah?

305
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,759
See this one?

306
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,229
Still haven't read that.

307
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:46,498
Everybody out there involved
in Harry Rawlings' business

308
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,133
as far as the eye can see.

309
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:52,106
But you, you here living
with him, and you're not.

310
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:53,940
I didn't work
for Harry.

311
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:55,641
I work for
the teachers' union.

312
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:57,742
I understand.

313
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:00,781
Criminals like cops, they
don't bring their shit home.

314
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,083
You have no idea, do you?

315
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:06,352
Or did you choose not to know?

316
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,556
It doesn't matter.

317
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,026
Please join me.

318
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,994
Oh, come on. I don't bite.

319
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:15,495
Hey...

320
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,498
What do they
say about dogs, huh?

321
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,134
That they're good judges
of character?

322
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,773
You see, that money
was meant to...

323
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:27,672
buy me a new life,

324
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:29,741
help with my campaign.
You understand?

325
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:30,942
Listen, I don't
have your money.

326
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,644
Now, why don't you
just go out and make more?

327
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:34,779
This is about my life!

328
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,750
This is about my life.

329
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,454
Because it's about my life,
it now becomes about yours.

330
00:22:41,721 --> 00:22:43,689
I told you.
I don't know anything...

331
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:44,789
No,
and even if that's true,

332
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,192
you have
a nice penthouse here.

333
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,994
You got
a lot of nice furniture,

334
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:49,836
you got cars, you got
a closet full of clothes,

335
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,466
none of which burnt up
in the van, by the way.

336
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,700
I'll give you
one month to liquidate.

337
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:55,702
I'll call the police.

338
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:57,370
Mrs. Rawlings, do you know
what the police did

339
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:59,341
the night
that Harry died? Do you?

340
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,542
They laughed.

341
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,910
They laughed
over his melted, burnt body,

342
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:07,212
and they scraped whatever
they could into a bag

343
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:08,713
and they went to a bar
to celebrate,

344
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,682
because they give zero fucks

345
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:13,621
about Harry Rawlings'
fucking widow.

346
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:17,092
You're nothing now.

347
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,096
Welcome back.

348
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,202
So, uh, my money...

349
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:30,238
one month.

350
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:38,878
What the hell
are you doing?

351
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:42,648
How'd you get in here?
Who the hell are you?

352
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,952
Who the hell are you?

353
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,518
I'm calling the cops.

354
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,585
And saying what?

355
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,388
That you're
in my fucking store!

356
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,623
That wouldn't be true.
This is not your store.

357
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,095
Obviously, your loser husband
didn't tell you.

358
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:55,626
You knew him?

359
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:58,163
Yes, and he knows
this is not your store.

360
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:00,865
I have a lease.
I pay that shit every month!

361
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,701
You gave that money to Carlos,

362
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:04,268
and he spent it all at Arlington

363
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,574
until the money ran out,
and he couldn't keep up.

364
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:08,440
Then he started
paying it to us.

365
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:11,476
Then he fell behind,
then he gave us the store.

366
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:13,314
Or, to be fair, we took it.

367
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:14,746
It's like this.

368
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,649
Carlos doesn't own it,
you don't own it.

369
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:17,882
It's a system.

370
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,884
Fuck your system!
That's my money!

371
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:22,354
Maybe I'm
not explaining this clearly.

372
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,425
- Ask Carlos.
- He's dead.

373
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,290
Condolences.

374
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,561
I'm just collecting
a debt here, ma'am.

375
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:31,630
He should've loved you more
and the bookies less.

376
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,886
Mrs. Rawlings,
I wanted to say that, uh,

377
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,422
you don't have to keep me
hanging around

378
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:40,158
the way that Harry did, if you
don't want. You can hire

379
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,893
- someone else, if you want.
- I can't afford to hire

380
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,828
someone else, Bash.
I can't even afford to keep you.

381
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,430
You don't have to worry.

382
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:49,404
I can always get a job working
security at a bar part-time.

383
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:55,309
What if you keep the car?

384
00:26:57,045 --> 00:26:59,179
- This car?
- Yeah, you drive me around,

385
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:02,015
you get me back on my feet,
and you keep the car.

386
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,519
Where do you wanna go?

387
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,700
The people I know

388
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,271
are never gonna pay you
for a notebook, Mrs. Rawlings.

389
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:28,206
So, let's pretend
you just came down here

390
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:31,312
to refill Harry's flask
and have a drink.

391
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:36,951
What if I told you that
Harry owed a lot of money...

392
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,988
and now those people
want it from me?

393
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:42,722
And what if I told you...

394
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,527
a construction accident
didn't put me in this chair?

395
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,629
A debt did.

396
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:53,367
This is not your world.

397
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:58,572
Use that notebook
to settle the debt.

398
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,642
They might take it.

399
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,545
It's what Harry
would have wanted.

400
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:09,350
Render unto Caesar...

401
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:12,687
what is Caesar's,
Mrs. Rawlings.

402
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,455
<i>Albert Woodfox
organized a chapter</i>

403
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>of the Black Panther Party
in Angola Prison,</i>

404
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:22,160

00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:25,663

406

00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:38,175

411
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:39,443

00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:44,950

00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,087
<i>it makes no difference.</i>

415
00:28:57,765 --> 00:28:58,967
Bash.

416
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:03,471
I need those names.

417
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:09,477
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:16,847
Oh, my God!
It smells like a dead rat!

419
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:18,519
I think I should get a job.

420
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:22,153
As what?
A house cleaner?

421
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,523
Serve coffee?

422
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,990
Why would you ever do that?

423
00:29:25,992 --> 00:29:27,191
What else am I gonna do?

424
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:29,260
I went from your home
to Florek's home.

425
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:32,766
Men are supposed
to provide for you.

426
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:36,133
Where did all the money go?

427
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:38,002
I told you, Ma. We spent it.

428
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:39,806
Wanted me to have a nice life.

429
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:42,643
How much did you
get for your things?

430
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:45,113
Three thousand.

431
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:46,978
What about the bike?

432
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,213
Gave it to Florek's friend.

433
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:49,616
What am I gonna do
with a bike?

434
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,717
You idiot!

435
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:54,219
- You never ask for enough!
- Why? I should be like you

436
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,953
and ask for everything,
like I deserve it?

437
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:57,354
Drive my husband
in the ground?

438
00:29:57,356 --> 00:29:59,559
Take care of myself
before my children?

439
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:07,534
I'm sorry, Mama.

440
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,370
I just don't know what to do.

441
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:21,848
Such
a beautiful girl I made.

442
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:24,351
I wanna show you something.

443
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:33,627
It's an arrangement site.

444
00:30:36,363 --> 00:30:38,730
Alitzia,
these girls are smart.

445
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:41,134
They go out one night a week
and make as much

446
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:44,038
as they'd make
in a month at a 7-Eleven.

447
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:46,706
On top of that,
if you're sweet...

448
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,343
like you...

449
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:52,110
they get bonuses.
They get jewelry.

450
00:30:52,112 --> 00:30:54,715
They get treated
like a princess.

451
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:58,219
And they go to college.

452
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:01,689
That's what I want for you,
sweetheart.

453
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:04,358
Is that so wrong?

454
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:09,630
I'm not gonna sleep
with men I don't know.

455
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,834
That ain't my life.

456
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,838
What do you mean by that?

457
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:24,077
Who the fuck do you
think you are, Alitzia?

458
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:27,913
You forget whose roof
you slept under

459
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:32,419
when you were 16, 17, 15.

460
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,491
So don't act like you're
the fucking Virgin Mary.

461
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:41,128
Those boys didn't pay me.

462
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,733
Everybody,
thanks for coming today.

463
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:50,904
Today, we are
standing on a vacant lot.

464
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,673
But tomorrow,
thanks to MWOW,

465
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:57,077
the Minority Women Owned Work
initiative my father started,

466
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:59,244
this will be
a thriving business,

467
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:02,482
owned and operated
by the women of this ward.

468
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:04,382
And it is my dream

469
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:07,052
to continue that amazing work
that my father began,

470
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:09,555
because this
is the 14th business

471
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:11,657
that has opened
in the past three years.

472
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,525
As long as there is
a Mulligan in office,

473
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:16,363
there will be 14 more
in my first term, I promise.

474
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:18,399
Now, can I get an "M-Wow"?

475
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:20,164
M-Wow!

476
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,400
Can I get an "M-Wow"?

477
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:22,901
M-Wow!
- All right, all right.

478
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:23,768
Now, where are my, uh...

479
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,103
- Where are my success stories?
- Yes!

480
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,304
- We got some success stories.
- Come on.

481
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,338
Mr. Mulligan,
we want to talk about

482
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,440
the audit that just came out.

483
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,209
- Come on up!
- All right, let's...

484
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:31,509
Perhaps some
of your constituents

485
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:32,911
will be interested
to hear about it.

486
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:36,248
These women, they aren't just
in business for themselves.

487
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,482
They're in business
for the whole community.

488
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:39,718
Over a million dollars

489
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,353
they have generated
in the past three years.

490
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:43,153
That's money that goes back
into the community.

491
00:32:43,155 --> 00:32:44,823
It's money that stays here,

492
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:46,290
- in the 18th ward.
- Mr. Mulligan,

493
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,625
an audit by the Cook County
comptroller

494
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,160
shows over five million
dollars in overages...

495
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:50,362
All right. Here we go.

496
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:51,541
...from the proposed

497
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:52,941
- extension of the Green Line.
- M-Wow!

498
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:55,232
During that time, you were
head of the CTA's commission.

499
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,300
- Congratulations.
- A position

500
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:57,870
you were appointed to
by your father.

501
00:32:57,872 --> 00:32:59,738
Do you care to comment on the
contracts you awarded while

502
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,506
- serving on the commission?
- Mr. McRoberts. Sorry.

503
00:33:01,508 --> 00:33:03,342
I'll see you all on the 7th.
Thank you for coming out.

504
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,376
Come on, Jack!
Give me a quote I can use.

505
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,144
What about the contracts
you awarded

506
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:08,279
while serving
on the commission?

507
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:09,458
All right, that's, uh...

508
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:10,783
What about
the proposed extension

509
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:12,316
- of the Green Line?
- That's enough questions,

510
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:13,351
- thank you.
- The Green Line

511
00:33:13,353 --> 00:33:14,793
should serve
the people of this ward.

512
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:17,021
Now, it can bring customers
to business like this

513
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:20,191
and at the end of the day, it
can take tired workers home.

514
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:21,825
Without that kind
of infrastructure

515
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:25,096
MWOW is just another
empty gesture doomed to fail.

516
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:26,297
You asked me about my father.

517
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,432
My father taught me
about this neighborhood.

518
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:30,367
He taught me
to empower the very people

519
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,836
that this city has
overlooked for so long.

520
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:34,338
But I'll see you, 18th,

521
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,240
and I'll make sure
the rest of Chicago does, too.

522
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:37,542
Thank you.

523
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:39,614
End fucking quote.

524
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:45,583
That fucking
scumbag McRoberts!

525
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:46,665
Won't he ever just give up?

526
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:49,453
He's been shit on the sole
of my family's shoes forever.

527
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:51,155
I wouldn't worry
about McRoberts.

528
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:52,323
I'd be more worried
about the numbers.

529
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:53,458
Your friend Jamal's no joke.

530
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,828
Fucking Jamal...

531
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:01,334
Tell me, have you ever slept
with a black guy?

532
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,367
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

533
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:04,809
Have you ever slept
with a black guy?

534
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:07,171
What does that have
to do with Jamal, or anything?

535
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:08,709
Just answer
the fucking question.

536
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,546
We are in a situation
where you could lose everything.

537
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:15,279
You've got the IG's office

538
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:16,480
and the Feds
breathing down your neck.

539
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:17,950
You got Jamal Manning
climbing in the polls,

540
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:18,995
and all you're concerned with

541
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:20,518
is whether or not
your dick is bigger than his?

542
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,120
What are we
fighting for? This?

543
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:23,522
You know how many
shootings happened

544
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:24,823
in this city
last weekend alone?

545
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:27,895
Thirty-four! These people
are killing each other!

546
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:30,761
This is not where
I wanna raise my children.

547
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:33,433
What are we
fighting for exactly?

548
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:36,500
I feel suffocated!

549
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:38,136
I'm not a Mulligan,
I'm my mother's son!

550
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:39,370
God rest her soul!

551
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:41,372
The shit she had to put up
with from my father!

552
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:42,506
I'm putting up with it, too.

553
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:43,774
That's what adults do, Jack.

554
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:45,477
I never wanted to be
in this fucking business

555
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:48,381
and that's all this is.
It's a fucking business!

556
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:54,185
Christ! I just wanna
be free of this shit.

557
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,352
Can't take it anymore,
I just...

558
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,754
Wake the fuck up, Jack.

559
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:58,489
You are not going
to pussy out now.

560
00:34:58,491 --> 00:34:59,857
What are you gonna do?
Work in a bank?

561
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,893
Take the train downtown,
punch a clock?

562
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:03,227
This is your life!

563
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,932
This is our life.
It's what we do.

564
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:07,765
Everyone has
a fucking sob story,

565
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,234
most of them better than yours.

566
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:10,701
So, if the idea is to be
mayor one day,

567
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:12,539
you'd better man the fuck up!

568
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:15,843
Jesus.

569
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:24,417
Dollar signs
and empty promises.

570
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:29,754
Anybody who thinks different
are fooling themselves.

571
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:31,725
It's the God's honest truth.

572
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:34,494
Thanks, John.

573
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:48,876
Fellas!

574
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,049
<i>I can't believe
none of us have ever met.</i>

575
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:58,616
<i>Are you sure we
should've ordered champagne?</i>

576
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:00,488
<i>She invited us.
It's fine.</i>

577
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:03,321
So she didn't tell you
anything else on the phone?

578
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,960
Nothing.
Just the time and place.

579
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:09,928
Is one of you Alice?

580
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,495
- Mm.
- Amanda?

581
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:13,332
I'm Linda. Who's Amanda?

582
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,899
Let's hope it doesn't matter.

583
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:16,869
I'm Veronica Rawlings,
Harry's wife.

584
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:18,538
You're Harry's wife?

585
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:20,441
How'd you two meet?

586
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:22,042
Follow me.

587
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:26,377
Your husbands worked
a long time for my husband.

588
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:27,881
With your husband.

589
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,952
How you doing for money?

590
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:37,825
Here. To tide you over.

591
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,593
Till what?

592
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:53,740
How are the children?

593
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,809
She's the one with the kids.

594
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:57,778
They're fine.

595
00:37:00,212 --> 00:37:02,216
I have a business proposition.

596
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:10,190
If you have
a high-risk threshold.

597
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:19,500
Listen.

598
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,401
We're in trouble.

599
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:25,437
It was Jamal Manning's money
that our husbands stole.

600
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,571
Who's that?

601
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:27,933
Somebody you
don't wanna fuck with.

602
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:29,741
The money burnt up in the van,

603
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:31,845
and Jamal Manning,
he wants it back.

604
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:33,480
From us? Or from you?

605
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:36,413
Harry left me the plans
for his next job.

606
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:37,883
It's worth five million dollars.

607
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,049
I take two million,

608
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,718
give it to the Mannings.
We split the rest.

609
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,687
- You want us to...
- Pull off the job, yeah.

610
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:43,923
A million apiece.

611
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:45,559
A million?

612
00:37:45,892 --> 00:37:47,991
Maybe you have a secret plan
or a special skill

613
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:49,727
that can make you
that kind of money.

614
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:51,730
But if you don't,
there's an address

615
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:53,832
in the pads of money
that I just gave you.

616
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,100
Meet me there
tomorrow at 11:15.

617
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:57,503
What if we say no?

618
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,939
She'll give him our names.

619
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,212
11:15 AM?

620
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:09,214
PM.

621
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:11,582
- It's not easy. I have kids.
- I don't want any trouble.

622
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,987
Listen, our lives
are in danger.

623
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:16,523
Our husbands
aren't coming back.

624
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,225
We're on our own.

625
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:21,127
Now, I'll be there tomorrow.

626
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:24,798
I hope to see you there.

627
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:40,781
So, what has
happened in the world...

628
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:44,151
that normal now
passes as excellence?

629
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:47,755
When did we lower
our standards?

630
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,189
There seems to be
no expectation

631
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:54,526
to go above and beyond
what one might know.

632
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:57,196
- Yeah. Yes, sir.
- Or might want to know.

633
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:03,201
It seems people are blissful
in their own ignorance.

634
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:07,174
How far have we fallen?

635
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,142
Indeed, how far have we fallen?

636
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:13,879
We are living in an environment
where people are blind!

637
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:17,214
What you don't see,
you don't know.

638
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:18,917
Out of sight, out of mind.

639
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:21,685
So now ignorance
is the new normal.

640
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:28,060
In fact, ignorance...
Ignorance is the new excellence.

641
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:32,830
The less you know
the more seemingly you gain.

642
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:36,937
Not to care is deemed
to be smart.

643
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:40,839
When you subtract
love from any equation,

644
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:43,774
from any situation,
from any location,

645
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:48,613
the result is always hurt
and pain on all sides.

646
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,584
That is why
we need to bring love

647
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,388
back into the equation.

648
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:59,256
Love.

649
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:01,192
In Jesus' words,

650
00:40:01,194 --> 00:40:04,431
"Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself."

651
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,665
So he can hear you on high,
say it with me.

652
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:09,500
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor

653
00:40:09,502 --> 00:40:10,801
- as thyself."
- Amen!

654
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:13,073
Even when it ain't easy!

655
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:16,210
Even when
you've been done wrong!

656
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,413
When this world's got you down
on your knees...

657
00:40:21,346 --> 00:40:24,250
love thy neighbor as thyself.

658
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:27,954
All right. Amen.

659
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,457
Noel, how are you, my brother?

660
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,526
Reverend Wheeler.

661
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:37,629
I'd like to introduce you
to Jamal Manning.

662
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,263
- Jamal...
- Yeah.

663
00:40:39,265 --> 00:40:40,625
You know,
that's Arabic for beauty,

664
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,801
and it is beautiful to see you.

665
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,734
It is so good to meet you,
Reverend.

666
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,171
I've admired you from afar.

667
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:48,272
Now you can do it up close.

668
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:49,873
Take a seat. Take a seat.

669
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:52,745
How about I go first?

670
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:54,013
Please.

671
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,015
Now, as of the last poll,
you were down by 12 points.

672
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:59,917
Now it's nine. Margin
of error, could be seven.

673
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,621
Could also be 11, too.

674
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:03,390
Thought I was going first?

675
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,524
Election's in less than a month.

676
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:07,926
If I was a doctor,
I'd be telling you

677
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:09,328
to get your affairs in order.

678
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:12,096
Three weeks from now,
you won't need a doctor.

679
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:14,565
You'll be asking someone like
me to give you last rites.

680
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:15,700
So says you.

681
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:17,102
So says me.

682
00:41:17,337 --> 00:41:18,335
Exactly. Me, the guy

683
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:20,370
with the largest congregation
in your ward

684
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:22,141
and an even larger outreach.

685
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:26,076
I've known the Mulligans
since I became a pastor.

686
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:27,745
No, he's not helping anybody.

687
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:29,750
Like I said, I know him.

688
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,185
So you're endorsing
the Mulligans. Can we go now?

689
00:41:33,187 --> 00:41:34,288
I didn't say that.

690
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:37,323
The ward has been redrawn.

691
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:39,493
The Mulligans
weren't playing ball.

692
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,561
For the first time,
someone like us has a shot.

693
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:44,094
I'd be an idiot to ignore that.

694
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:45,999
I'm gonna cut to the chase
here, Reverend.

695
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:49,067
I'm in the driving seat, I just
don't have a set of wheels.

696
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:51,935
All I need is your endorsement
and your contribution

697
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,073
to help me
get across the finish line.

698
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:56,910
How much of a contribution
do you need?

699
00:41:57,743 --> 00:41:59,345
And what's it worth to you?

700
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,981
You mean worth
in terms of funding?

701
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:04,848
I can fill you in on that,
but what matters

702
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,584
is that you're with us.

703
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,456
Someone's ears are burning.

704
00:42:10,957 --> 00:42:13,558
Gentlemen, let's discuss this
further another time.

705
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,362
One always must
weigh out options.

706
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:18,365
Jack Mulligan.
How are you, my brother?

707
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:20,964
No, you know me.

708
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:22,734
Praising Jesus, as always.

709
00:42:22,736 --> 00:42:24,203
Mm-hmm.

710
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:27,241
Mm-hmm.
School was good?

711
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:29,808
Okay, I gotta
get back to work.

712
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,341
Can you put your
grandma on the phone?

713
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,345
Mommy loves you.

714
00:42:33,245 --> 00:42:36,212
Hey, Ma, will you
put her to bed for me?

715
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:37,982
I'll be back as soon
as I can, all right?

716
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:39,618
You keep asking me,

717
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,260
- asking me for money...
- All right, bye.

718
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:44,756
So, I asked her,

719
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:46,368
how does she know it was true?
Who told her?

720
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:48,326
I'm tired of y'all
motherfuckers coming up here...

721
00:42:48,328 --> 00:42:49,993
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

722
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:51,194
What'd you call me?

723
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:53,966
You deaf?
Motherfucker. Goodbye.

724
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:01,641
What is going on?

725
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,876
Who was that,
and what does he want?

726
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:05,910
I don't want to talk about it.

727
00:43:05,912 --> 00:43:06,977
Breechelle,
are you in trouble?

728
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:08,513
I said
I don't want to talk about it.

729
00:43:08,515 --> 00:43:10,635
How long am I supposed
to be under this thing?

730
00:43:13,587 --> 00:43:14,888
Thank you.

731
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:17,488
I'm sorry
about all that.

732
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,955
Oh, that's all right.

733
00:43:18,957 --> 00:43:20,860
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:10,142
Wait for me here.

735
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,343
I really don't think this is
a good idea, Mrs. Rawlings.

736
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:15,081
Bash, give me the key.

737
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:04,458
Hey, I'm meeting
someone here.

738
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:10,430
You must be Alice.

739
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,832
You look just like you.

740
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,835
I'll take that
as a compliment.

741
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:16,470
Have a seat.

742
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:21,241
And you should.

743
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:24,274
Although, I gotta say,

744
00:46:24,276 --> 00:46:26,545
you're even more
stunning in person.

745
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:29,980
I'm David.

746
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:31,218
David...

747
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,220
Just David for now.

748
00:46:33,986 --> 00:46:35,320
Can I get you a drink?

749
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,455
- Definitely.
- Yeah?

750
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:38,589
Vodka rocks.

751
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,457
Okay.

752
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,161
Excellent.
Are you from Russia?

753
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:42,662
No, I'm Polish.

754
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:44,194
American.

755
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:45,632
My grandma came over, but...

756
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:47,734
I just like vodka.

757
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,866
Hey, excuse me,
can you get Alice here

758
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:51,303
a vodka rocks, please?

759
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:54,174
What are you drinking?

760
00:46:54,573 --> 00:46:55,608
Just ginger ale.

761
00:46:57,243 --> 00:46:58,778
Have you done this before?

762
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:01,680
I'm not really sure
what you mean.

763
00:47:03,183 --> 00:47:04,751
If I said no,
what would you say?

764
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:08,355
I would probably say
something reassuring.

765
00:47:09,856 --> 00:47:11,223
Okay. Do that.

766
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:13,692
Okay.

767
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,627
Well, Alice...

768
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:18,298
I feel lucky
to have met you tonight...

769
00:47:18,832 --> 00:47:21,600
and hopefully, in time,
you'll feel the same way.

770
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,472
Cheers.

771
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:43,089
Mommy!

772
00:47:43,522 --> 00:47:44,754
Baby. Hey.

773
00:47:47,026 --> 00:47:48,259
You look beat.

774
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:50,259
I've been up since 5:30.
I had to...

775
00:47:52,832 --> 00:47:53,933
Hello?

776
00:47:54,399 --> 00:47:56,901
Bailee, it's okay. Come here.
Come here, baby.

777
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:59,136
I can take the bus. I'll be
there in about 20 minutes.

778
00:47:59,138 --> 00:48:00,538
Come here, sweetie.

779
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,006
Cabs are a little hard for me.
Twenty minutes.

780
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,542
Baby, you just got home.

781
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:06,143
Twelve bucks an hour.
I gotta take it.

782
00:48:06,145 --> 00:48:07,245
Bailee's been waiting for you

783
00:48:07,247 --> 00:48:08,527
- all night.
- Ma, please.

784
00:48:09,182 --> 00:48:11,015
At least let me
fix you something to eat!

785
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:12,252
I'mma be back.

786
00:48:30,002 --> 00:48:31,437
I see you!

787
00:48:33,638 --> 00:48:35,774
You can't run
from a brother, baby!

788
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:47,819
That one.

789
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:50,354
That one's
the Jewelers' Building,

790
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:52,256
designed by
Giaver and Dinkelberg.

791
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:53,826
Five hundred and twenty three
feet.

792
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:55,294
How do you know all that?

793
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:59,164
I told you,
I develop buildings. Big ones.

794
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:02,301
Some you can see from here,
some in other countries.

795
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:03,937
That one.

796
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,305
That one is a hotel.

797
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,276
You wanna go?

798
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:15,448
Look, I promise, I'm a nice guy.

799
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,116
I used to be married.

800
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:20,720
Two years followed
by three shitty ones.

801
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:22,856
I work 80 hours a week.

802
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:26,258
I miss the intimacy.

803
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:30,595
I miss the way women smell.
The way they talk.

804
00:49:31,296 --> 00:49:33,330
You want all the good stuff,
none of the bad.

805
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:34,567
Don't you?

806
00:49:38,004 --> 00:49:39,937
- Belle? City Sitters?
- Yeah.

807
00:49:39,939 --> 00:49:41,875
Hi, I'm Linda. Come on in.

808
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:44,308
I'll only be a few hours.

809
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,879
Don't worry. I'm fine.

810
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,446
Hey, I'm Belle.

811
00:49:48,448 --> 00:49:49,613
I'm gonna be hanging with you

812
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,750
while your mom
does what she's gotta do.

813
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:53,986
I've got one of my own.

814
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:55,721
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

815
00:49:57,656 --> 00:50:00,290
Okay.
Well, you kids be good, okay?

816
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:29,522
Hello.

817
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:34,928
We're closed. Can I help you?

818
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,431
I'm here with a few questions.

819
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:41,367
About Harry Rawlings.

820
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:43,734
I'm betting you heard

821
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:45,438
he stole from
the Manning brothers.

822
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:49,276
Really?
Score one for us, huh?

823
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:52,310
I want you to tell me why.

824
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:55,848
What makes you think
I care about your wants, huh?

825
00:50:57,049 --> 00:50:58,584
Oh, fuck!

826
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:05,957
Jesus fucking Christ,
you shit!

827
00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:20,604
Why'd he fucking do it?

828
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,913
Let me ask you again.
Why'd he fucking do it?

829
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:29,682
Get the fuck off me, man!

830
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:40,991
I see you're paralyzed
from the waist down,

831
00:51:40,993 --> 00:51:42,125
but chest up... You feel this?

832
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:43,495
What the fuck?

833
00:51:45,296 --> 00:51:46,897
Oh, you feel that.

834
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,332
You fucking shit!

835
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:49,768
Oh, man.

836
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:53,038
Oh, this is like
that old game Operation.

837
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:55,841
You know that old game?

838
00:51:56,107 --> 00:51:57,239
Fuck.

839
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:58,643
Now, where the bread basket?

840
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:03,616
So, once again...

841
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:09,218
why... did... he... do it?

842
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:13,290
Does his wife know?

843
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:16,194
She doesn't know
anything about anything.

844
00:52:16,196 --> 00:52:18,531
Does that tickle? Mm?

845
00:52:18,832 --> 00:52:21,665
She's got his notebook, okay?
Just get the notebook.

846
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:23,100
What I want with a notebook?

847
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:24,370
Harry was old-school.

848
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:28,404
Wrote every single detail
of every job down on paper.

849
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:29,506
How that gonna help me?

850
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:30,940
It's all in there.
Every contact,

851
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:33,310
every bribe,
the last job, the next job.

852
00:52:33,312 --> 00:52:35,279
Down to the fucking
piss breaks, okay?

853
00:52:35,281 --> 00:52:36,583
You bullshitting me?

854
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,886
She has it.
I swear, all right?

855
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,089
Your swears
don't mean shit to me, dawg.

856
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:46,623
I have a no-kill
order right now,

857
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,093
so your timing
is very fortunate.

858
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:54,031
If I find out
you're lying to me,

859
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:56,970
there'll be an unfortunate
act of God, my nigga.

860
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,174
You fucker!

861
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:09,046
We can't do it,
the two of us.

862
00:53:09,048 --> 00:53:10,647
It's over. She's a flake.

863
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:13,450
- Just give her five minutes.
- Why?

864
00:53:13,452 --> 00:53:15,518
Because our lives
are trickier than yours.

865
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,221
What's tricky
about being on time?

866
00:53:17,223 --> 00:53:18,663
If she can't show...

867
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:22,529
What the hell are you wearing?

868
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:24,663
A condom.

869
00:53:25,564 --> 00:53:28,230
I'm here. I didn't
have to come, but I did.

870
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:29,267
We're screwed.

871
00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:31,067
You know what?
If you don't wanna be here,

872
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:32,268
then maybe you shouldn't.

873
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,703
There's the door. In or out?

874
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:35,772
Out, and you take your chances
with the Mannings.

875
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:37,373
In, and there's no going back.

876
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:39,210
How do we even know
what "in" means?

877
00:53:39,212 --> 00:53:40,544
Why should we
trust you, anyway?

878
00:53:40,546 --> 00:53:42,111
Because I'm the only one
standing between you

879
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:43,647
and a bullet in your head.

880
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:45,348
Because I wouldn't ask you
to do anything

881
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,716
I wouldn't do myself.

882
00:53:46,718 --> 00:53:49,888
Leave...
and you're on your own.

883
00:53:56,796 --> 00:53:57,797
I'm in.

884
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:02,634
In.

885
00:54:04,337 --> 00:54:07,873
Like I said, this next job
is worth five million dollars.

886
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:10,473
From what I can tell
with Harry's notebook,

887
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:12,875
the money is either in a house
or an apartment.

888
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:15,078
So the first thing
we're gonna need is a van.

889
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,515
Don't you have a car?
Probably a nice one.

890
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:19,815
The car is registered
to Harry. Think.

891
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:21,821
- I'll buy a van.
- Good. Progress.

892
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:23,053
What do I do?

893
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,823
Find out what this is
and where it is.

894
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,658
What? How am I
supposed to do that?

895
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,727
By being smarter
than you are right now.

896
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:31,395
Listen, we'll work out
what we need,

897
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:32,895
and we'll take it
from there, all right?

898
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:35,198
We'll meet here on Wednesday,
same time,

899
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,401
and I expect these items
to be off the list.

900
00:54:37,403 --> 00:54:39,506
I'm gonna need
transport money.

901
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:45,044
Phones. Use only in emergency.

902
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:47,212
This is for the guns.

903
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:50,580
- Guns?
- Three Glocks. Ammo, too.

904
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,417
- No more than $2,000.
- Me? From where?

905
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:55,054
It's America.

906
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:58,191
Olivia.
Come on.

907
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:03,826
You don't have a jacket?

908
00:55:03,828 --> 00:55:06,196
No. I think she's crazy.

909
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:07,997
Yep. She's got money.

910
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:09,868
Might as well see
where this goes.

911
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:14,573
Hundred.
Hundred dollars.

912
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,841
Nine, nine, can we get $900?
There's nine!

913
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:30,790
Thirteen. We got 13.
To 13, 14, 14...

914
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,892
Now 15, 16. And $1,500...

915
00:55:34,894 --> 00:55:38,928
Now, 16. Right now, 16, 17.
Took a bid. 18, $1,800...

916
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,131
Nineteen. Can we get 19, 19, 19?

917
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:44,134
You don't want this one.
The gearshift pops out at 60.

918
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:45,902
And sold.
Buyer number seven.

919
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:49,138
Next coming up.
'98 Dodge Ram van. '98.

920
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,309
500, 550.

921
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:52,676
Now, this one looks good,

922
00:55:52,678 --> 00:55:54,647
but you're gonna be
at the mechanic all the time.

923
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,151
- What do you want this for?
- Sold it there.

924
00:56:02,153 --> 00:56:05,156
Here's what I need.
A van, good pickup, low miles.

925
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:07,690
'05. Got the
white van. Got the white van.

926
00:56:07,692 --> 00:56:09,359
- Buy this one.
- Wait, which one?

927
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,560
This one, this one.

928
00:56:10,562 --> 00:56:12,965
Five, 550.
Six, six. Somebody...

929
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:16,134
Thank you now. Six, now seven.

930
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:20,839
Eight now. Nine.

931
00:56:21,607 --> 00:56:23,707
No. You're going higher
than what it's worth.

932
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,743
And six, six there now.

933
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:28,847
- A lot higher.
- Will it do what I ask?

934
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:32,582
Then it's not too much.
My boss is kind of a dick.

935
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:34,984
One! Sold it there, $6,000.
Forty-seven.

936
00:56:34,986 --> 00:56:37,754
Buyer 47 bought it, $6,000.

937
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:39,689
I won!

938
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:41,123
So, where are we
gonna go celebrate, huh?

939
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:44,196
Gold Chevy.
I'd say it's a $1,200.

940
00:56:44,796 --> 00:56:46,331
That was my first auction.

941
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:51,704
Jennifer Christie?

942
00:56:51,937 --> 00:56:54,207
- Can I please have it delivered?
- This isn't Grubhub.

943
00:56:56,274 --> 00:56:58,408
How do you go
to a car auction to get a car,

944
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:59,710
and you don't know
how to drive?

945
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,578
I didn't know they just
gave it to you right there.

946
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,678
I can't think of everything.

947
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,814
When I assign you a task,

948
00:57:03,816 --> 00:57:05,448
you're supposed
to complete that task.

949
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,352
You were meant to drive.

950
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,020
We're already one person down.
Now I have to ask Bash.

951
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:12,855
- Who's Bash?
- Harry's driver.

952
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:14,924
- Can we trust him?
- We have to now.

953
00:57:14,926 --> 00:57:16,794
- Why didn't you ask Linda?
- Because there is a plan!

954
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:18,263
Just shut up!

955
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,066
- How much you pay for it?
- Six thousand.

956
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:23,701
The point of an auction

957
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:25,468
is to spend less
than what you came with.

958
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,072
It was a good deal.

959
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:32,442
Don't let your dog
shit in my lap.

960
00:57:32,444 --> 00:57:33,746
She's house-trained.

961
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:42,888
We have a lot of work to do.
Crying isn't on the list.

962
00:57:50,196 --> 00:57:53,363
Mom, why do we
have to go to Lita's today?

963
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:54,964
Because she loves you.

964
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:57,232
<i>Because she's mad at you.</i>

965
00:57:57,234 --> 00:57:58,236
I know.

966
00:58:17,256 --> 00:58:18,687
- Hi.
- Hi.

967
00:58:18,689 --> 00:58:20,424
I'm with Gaspar-Judd.

968
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,393
This was designed by your firm

969
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:26,032
and I was wondering if
you could tell me where it is.

970
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:29,368
- I can't, really.
- What about who designed it?

971
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:32,337
Wait a minute.
Let me ask someone.

972
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:53,526
They told me
I can't tell you anything.

973
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:56,094
It's my first week of work...

974
00:58:56,227 --> 00:58:57,529
My boss...

975
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:01,901
It was designed
by Delia Foster.

976
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:03,667
Thank you.

977
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:10,309
Shit.

978
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:20,283
<i>Good afternoon, folks.</i>

979
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:22,118
<i>Thanks for coming
out here today.</i>

980
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,786
<i>We're gonna be talking
a little bit</i>

981
00:59:23,788 --> 00:59:25,055
<i>about handgun marksmanship.</i>

982
01:00:04,763 --> 01:00:06,062
I don't understand.

983
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,264
I'm sorry,

984
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:09,968
I'm hoping I could
get your help to buy gun.

985
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:13,872
This is hard. I'm a,
how you say, mail-order bride?

986
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:15,839
When I arrived, my husband,

987
01:00:15,841 --> 01:00:18,007
he took my visa,
passport, everything.

988
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:19,875
He beat me, always.
I finally left.

989
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:20,944
I had to for my babies,

990
01:00:20,946 --> 01:00:22,678
but he swear
he going to kill me.

991
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,781
I can't go to police.
I'm illegal.

992
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,984
I want a gun
just to feel safe.

993
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:29,419
I have cash. I know what I need.
Will you help me?

994
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:33,859
Mom, you always say
a gun is a girl's best friend.

995
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:37,163
What do you need?

996
01:00:37,363 --> 01:00:38,931
Three Glock 17s.

997
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:41,064
That's a lot of firepower.

998
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:42,935
I want one for every room.

999
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:56,245
- Mr. Foster?
- Yeah.

1000
01:00:56,247 --> 01:01:00,684
Hi. I'm Annette Castille.
I work with Bridges and Getty.

1001
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:03,721
Oh, uh, I'm sorry,
I don't think we've met.

1002
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:05,323
Um, I'm new.

1003
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:09,658
I work mostly as a secretary
with Miss Christina Glickman.

1004
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,563
Uh-huh. I think I know her.

1005
01:01:11,997 --> 01:01:13,298
May I come in?

1006
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,501
Oh, um...

1007
01:01:16,535 --> 01:01:18,437
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1008
01:01:22,841 --> 01:01:24,076
Here.

1009
01:01:24,709 --> 01:01:26,310
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1010
01:01:27,212 --> 01:01:30,316
I was trying to get in touch
with your wife, Delia.

1011
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:36,020
I have a few questions
about some projects.

1012
01:01:36,754 --> 01:01:40,058
I have a client who would
really like to speak with her.

1013
01:01:41,227 --> 01:01:42,595
I think you should leave.

1014
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:44,964
What? Why?

1015
01:01:46,263 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm not interested in talking
to you or whoever sent you.

1016
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:51,335
Obviously,
you're not with Bridges,

1017
01:01:51,337 --> 01:01:53,506
as everyone there knows,
my wife died.

1018
01:01:54,705 --> 01:01:56,408
Four months ago.

1019
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:00,613
I'm sorry.

1020
01:02:03,549 --> 01:02:05,017
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:02:06,584 --> 01:02:08,119
I asked you to go.

1022
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:16,062
I lost my husband
two weeks ago.

1023
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:31,343
Oh, my...

1024
01:03:09,013 --> 01:03:11,116
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1025
01:03:33,337 --> 01:03:35,807
What do I know
about blueprints anyway?

1026
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:38,107
She's probably gonna
make me walk the streets

1027
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:40,178
of Chicago
until I find this place.

1028
01:03:40,879 --> 01:03:42,146
Leave them with me.

1029
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:44,316
- What?
- Leave them with me.

1030
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:49,587
Come on. It's our stop.

1031
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:26,522
So, Harry Rawlings
kept some sort of diary.

1032
01:04:26,524 --> 01:04:28,457
Liked to write
shit down longhand.

1033
01:04:28,459 --> 01:04:30,593
- What kind of shit?
- Plans, people.

1034
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:33,129
Details on how he robbed us
and who was next.

1035
01:04:33,131 --> 01:04:34,399
His woman has it.

1036
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:35,834
You sure?

1037
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,502
Easy enough to find out.

1038
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,639
That notebook could lead us
to some big money.

1039
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:45,744
You do not touch her.

1040
01:04:46,212 --> 01:04:47,613
I don't need
that type of heat.

1041
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:50,281
No touching.

1042
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:53,184
She got two weeks
to pay us back.

1043
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:54,819
If she don't...

1044
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:57,822
she gonna need more than
a notebook to bargain with.

1045
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:14,569
<i>Hello?</i>

1046
01:05:14,571 --> 01:05:18,810
It's Welsh.
Bobby Welsh, yeah, yeah.

1047
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:22,847
Have you, uh...
Have you given up that notebook?

1048
01:05:25,316 --> 01:05:27,183
- Yes.
<i>- You have?</i>

1049
01:05:27,185 --> 01:05:29,720
<i>Good. Good.
That's smart. That's smart.</i>

1050
01:05:29,988 --> 01:05:31,486
Are you sure you're okay?

1051
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:34,225
<i>Yes, thank you.
Thank you for calling.</i>

1052
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:36,292
<i>I have to go now, Mr. Welsh.</i>

1053
01:05:36,294 --> 01:05:37,995
Listen, if there's anything...

1054
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:53,542
Seriously, Jack, what
the fuck are you gonna do?

1055
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:55,143
I'm gonna beat
his gay black ass.

1056
01:05:55,145 --> 01:05:56,446
I'm ahead in the polls.

1057
01:05:56,448 --> 01:05:58,415
It's a six-point lead,
and it's falling.

1058
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,683
Is he gay?

1059
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:01,951
He doesn't have
5.1 million question marks

1060
01:06:01,953 --> 01:06:03,553
- around his name.
- Should never

1061
01:06:03,555 --> 01:06:05,721
have taken the appointment
on the Green Line commission.

1062
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:08,390
Bad optics. You and your dad
should've known better.

1063
01:06:08,392 --> 01:06:10,026
Green Line seems
to run right through

1064
01:06:10,028 --> 01:06:11,460
your own personal cookie jar.

1065
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:13,529
Get the fuck out of here.
You don't believe that shit.

1066
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:15,765
Jesus Christ!
Trains are expensive.

1067
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:16,567
So are swimming pools

1068
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:18,401
- and paintings and boats.
- And I work hard.

1069
01:06:18,403 --> 01:06:20,203
He's got four kids at Latin

1070
01:06:20,205 --> 01:06:21,437
- and the Jag.
- Used.

1071
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:22,705
One exquisite ex-wife.

1072
01:06:22,707 --> 01:06:25,607
That's not exactly
the adjective I'd use.

1073
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:28,544
You know what? Fuck.
I'm not gonna

1074
01:06:28,546 --> 01:06:30,348
stay around for
the rest of the math lesson.

1075
01:06:31,183 --> 01:06:32,281
I'll see you all at my

1076
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:33,683
- victory party.
- Where's he going?

1077
01:06:33,718 --> 01:06:35,685
Where you can beg me not to
have the IRS audit any of you.

1078
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:37,419
- Jack... Come back.
- Yeah, Jack what?

1079
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:38,989
- What? Come on!
- Oh, come on!

1080
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:41,189
- You still got my vote.
- Yeah, I won't need it.

1081
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:42,825
Jack, come back.

1082
01:06:42,827 --> 01:06:43,928
You cocksuckers.

1083
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,703
Mm.

1084
01:06:52,604 --> 01:06:53,839
Hi, baby.

1085
01:06:57,908 --> 01:06:58,943
Morning.

1086
01:07:06,618 --> 01:07:08,687
<i>Never thought
I'd marry a white man.</i>

1087
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,321
<i>Or a criminal.</i>

1088
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,433
Fucking me
won't make it better.

1089
01:07:24,602 --> 01:07:26,669
Don't make me feel
like my only regret

1090
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:28,573
is having a child with you.

1091
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:31,242
Maybe you're right.

1092
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,375
Maybe you should've had him
with someone else.

1093
01:07:33,377 --> 01:07:34,946
Then he'd still be alive.

1094
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:05,570
<i>Hello?</i>

1095
01:09:06,371 --> 01:09:07,706
<i>Amanda?</i>

1096
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:10,676
No.

1097
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:14,813
It just comes in waves,
you know?

1098
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:18,584
Sure. Sure.

1099
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,853
Yeah, I can do that.

1100
01:09:21,886 --> 01:09:23,388
<i>I wasn't
trying to be rude</i>

1101
01:09:23,587 --> 01:09:26,692
by not turning up to the spa.
I was just scared.

1102
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:28,593
Maybe.

1103
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,560
I don't know.

1104
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:34,032
A lot of things. Scared, sad.

1105
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:37,069
What do they say about grief?
How many stages?

1106
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:39,404
I'm not sure which one I'm in.

1107
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:42,504
Maybe I was even angry.

1108
01:09:42,506 --> 01:09:43,606
I got the impression from Jimmy

1109
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:45,341
he wasn't so sure
about this one.

1110
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,011
Thought Harry
was getting sloppy.

1111
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:49,212
Harry was never sloppy.

1112
01:09:49,214 --> 01:09:52,216
Thirty years of doing
what he did, not one mistake.

1113
01:09:52,783 --> 01:09:54,952
I guess he was
human after all.

1114
01:09:59,924 --> 01:10:02,060
So what did you
wanna talk to me about?

1115
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:05,128
I just wanted to know
how you were

1116
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,698
since losing your husband.

1117
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:12,638
I'm a single parent
of a four-month-old baby boy.

1118
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:16,040
How are you
coping on your own?

1119
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:18,844
Getting through it.

1120
01:10:19,576 --> 01:10:21,078
What are you gonna do?

1121
01:10:24,049 --> 01:10:26,984
Look for answers,
try to figure it out.

1122
01:10:27,986 --> 01:10:31,990
Well... I hope he left you
enough to start over.

1123
01:10:32,657 --> 01:10:34,493
Maybe go somewhere else?

1124
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:53,778
Hey.

1125
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:17,536
That a Super Bowl ring?

1126
01:11:18,102 --> 01:11:19,770
1985 Bears.

1127
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,538
You played
for the Bears

1128
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,807
when they won the Super Bowl?

1129
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,209
Hey, Asthma.

1130
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:26,743
Did Bash Babiak
win the Super Bowl?

1131
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:28,212
Don't believe he did.

1132
01:11:28,647 --> 01:11:31,647
No. It was a birthday
present from Harry.

1133
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:32,718
Mm.

1134
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:35,787
I want you to help me
get Harry's notebook.

1135
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:37,387
I don't have it.

1136
01:11:37,389 --> 01:11:38,890
I know you don't.
She has it.

1137
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:40,522
Who?

1138
01:11:40,524 --> 01:11:43,127
Veronica.
Mrs. Rawlings. Your boss.

1139
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:45,964
You're gonna agree
to get it for me.

1140
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:49,533
I don't work for her.
She don't have any money.

1141
01:11:50,134 --> 01:11:53,038
She doesn't have any notebook,
far as I know.

1142
01:11:56,741 --> 01:11:58,674
Give that
motherfucker two piece spicy.

1143
01:11:58,676 --> 01:12:01,343
- Fuck!
- No biscuit!

1144
01:12:03,348 --> 01:12:04,881
<i>Pass rush coming.</i>

1145
01:12:04,883 --> 01:12:07,482
<i>Two guys, stretched out,
landing. Just on the 40...</i>

1146
01:12:08,752 --> 01:12:10,285
<i>Settled, stretching out,
playing brilliantly</i>

1147
01:12:10,287 --> 01:12:11,721
<i>despite that low angle...</i>

1148
01:12:17,094 --> 01:12:20,131
Mrs. Rawlings,
we have an envelope for you.

1149
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,200
There you go.

1150
01:12:38,349 --> 01:12:39,949
Bash? What's going on?

1151
01:12:39,951 --> 01:12:42,384
<i>What's going on
is you have one week.</i>

1152
01:12:54,398 --> 01:12:56,233
I thought we were going out.

1153
01:12:57,935 --> 01:13:00,237
I thought so, too,
and then I saw you.

1154
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:02,374
I decided
we should try being late.

1155
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:14,052
Leave them.

1156
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:18,957
What, are you building
a safe room?

1157
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:20,625
A what?

1158
01:13:20,892 --> 01:13:23,228
This. It looks like a...

1159
01:13:23,694 --> 01:13:25,661
It looks like a safe room.
A nice one.

1160
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:27,797
You can tell that
just by looking at the plans?

1161
01:13:27,799 --> 01:13:29,801
- Yeah.
- Can you tell me where it is?

1162
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:32,837
I know a guy who can find out.

1163
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:37,109
If you're really asking that.

1164
01:13:52,122 --> 01:13:53,290
Alice?

1165
01:13:55,193 --> 01:13:56,158
How would you feel about

1166
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,095
making this
arrangement exclusive?

1167
01:13:59,363 --> 01:14:01,030
I think I'd like that.

1168
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:02,034
Yeah?

1169
01:14:29,626 --> 01:14:31,429
Oh, shit! That's my ma.

1170
01:14:32,296 --> 01:14:33,628
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

1171
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:35,030
- You shitting me?
- No.

1172
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:37,167
- Oh, fuck.
- Get your clothes on.

1173
01:14:41,406 --> 01:14:43,408
Just a minute. Mom?

1174
01:14:43,774 --> 01:14:45,277
<i>It's Veronica.</i>

1175
01:14:49,913 --> 01:14:51,247
What are you doing here?

1176
01:14:51,249 --> 01:14:52,983
I didn't know
where else to go.

1177
01:14:55,286 --> 01:14:56,321
Come in.

1178
01:15:04,895 --> 01:15:06,298
Just sit on the bed.

1179
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,470
I'll just finish
getting dressed.

1180
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,776
Your mom, huh?

1181
01:15:31,223 --> 01:15:33,390
Your husband's
been dead a month.

1182
01:15:34,192 --> 01:15:35,861
Why are you being
such a bitch?

1183
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,526
You're being a cunt.

1184
01:15:37,528 --> 01:15:38,793
Don't you say that word to me.

1185
01:15:38,795 --> 01:15:40,530
It's appropriate.
You're being a cunt.

1186
01:15:40,532 --> 01:15:41,732
A friend lets a friend know...

1187
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,132
- when she's being a cunt.
- You're not a friend.

1188
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:44,734
You're just a stupid girl
with nothing in your head.

1189
01:15:44,736 --> 01:15:45,834
I'm not stupid.

1190
01:15:45,836 --> 01:15:47,101
Then why don't you
keep your legs shut?

1191
01:15:47,103 --> 01:15:48,870
- David is gonna help us.
- Help us do what?

1192
01:15:48,872 --> 01:15:50,172
He thinks the blueprints
are a safe room.

1193
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:51,339
He's gonna find out
where it is.

1194
01:15:51,341 --> 01:15:53,674
- You idiot.
- You're a cold, old bitch!

1195
01:15:59,149 --> 01:16:01,286
I'm done being
treated like shit.

1196
01:16:03,153 --> 01:16:04,356
Not again.

1197
01:16:05,223 --> 01:16:06,390
Not by you.

1198
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,460
Not by anyone.

1199
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:15,567
They killed Bash.

1200
01:16:18,502 --> 01:16:19,537
Who did?

1201
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:24,408
- The Mannings.
- What? How do you know?

1202
01:16:25,175 --> 01:16:26,310
I know.

1203
01:16:30,682 --> 01:16:32,050
I'm not Harry.

1204
01:16:33,684 --> 01:16:35,618
All this damage, I...

1205
01:16:36,187 --> 01:16:37,753
I can't be responsible
for all of it.

1206
01:16:37,755 --> 01:16:38,988
Why do you have to be?

1207
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,892
Because I don't own anything.

1208
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,362
Not even
the apartment I live in.

1209
01:16:48,599 --> 01:16:50,067
I have nothing.

1210
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:17,162
We can't tell Linda
about Bash.

1211
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:19,865
She'll back out.

1212
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:23,932
You need to find us
a new driver.

1213
01:17:23,934 --> 01:17:24,974
That's not easy.

1214
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:26,869
Don't you
know anyone else?

1215
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:28,704
No! I'm working on it.

1216
01:17:28,706 --> 01:17:29,905
What have you been
doing all week?

1217
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:31,006
She's had a rough time.

1218
01:17:31,008 --> 01:17:33,042
Yeah?
They wanna repo my home!

1219
01:17:33,044 --> 01:17:35,311
My bitch of a mother-in-law
wants to take away my kids.

1220
01:17:35,313 --> 01:17:36,579
What's your kids
and mother-in-law

1221
01:17:36,581 --> 01:17:37,581
have to do with me?

1222
01:17:37,648 --> 01:17:39,280
I gave you one job,
and you couldn't even do it,

1223
01:17:39,282 --> 01:17:40,816
so don't tell me
how to do mine!

1224
01:17:40,818 --> 01:17:42,717
If we fuck this up

1225
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,023
I know what the consequences
of this shit look like.

1226
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:50,327
Have either of you ever
been to a prison? Once?

1227
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:54,398
I didn't think so.

1228
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:56,401
Six days.

1229
01:17:58,068 --> 01:17:59,937
Find a fucking driver!

1230
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:09,214
I know.

1231
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:12,616
Veronica.

1232
01:18:12,716 --> 01:18:15,116
- Can I come in?
- Did you call?

1233
01:18:15,118 --> 01:18:17,221
No. Can I ask you
some questions?

1234
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:19,189
Oh, sure. Of course.

1235
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,324
Let me put Albert in his room.

1236
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:22,958
- Albert? Beautiful.
- Thanks.

1237
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,130
- Can I put my dog down?
- Sure, of course.

1238
01:18:34,973 --> 01:18:37,740
Um, this is actually not
a very good time for me.

1239
01:18:37,742 --> 01:18:39,052
The baby is really fussy today...

1240
01:18:39,076 --> 01:18:40,842
Did Jimmy tell you
about anyone else?

1241
01:18:40,844 --> 01:18:42,279
Someone who could drive a job?

1242
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:45,381
- Veronica, what are you doing?
- Someone with some skills.

1243
01:18:45,383 --> 01:18:47,251
Maybe the person
who prepped his cars.

1244
01:18:48,218 --> 01:18:50,255
You need to leave this alone.

1245
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:55,360
Sorry, I gotta...
I'll be right back.

1246
01:19:11,876 --> 01:19:13,178
Olivia!

1247
01:20:17,608 --> 01:20:20,211
We should have left sooner,
like you said we would.

1248
01:20:22,947 --> 01:20:24,549
You always want more.

1249
01:21:12,563 --> 01:21:15,598
Your medical examiner
friend open his mouth yet?

1250
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:17,535
Grab the leg!
Get the leg!

1251
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:27,211
<i>Not yet.
But he wants his money.</i>

1252
01:21:28,478 --> 01:21:30,780
<i>Even dead bodies cost money
in this economy.</i>

1253
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:33,348
What about that detective
scumbag, Fuller?

1254
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,317
He's just happy that
you'll never show your face

1255
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:36,418
in Chicago again.

1256
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,323
He's retiring a wealthy man.

1257
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,624
You know, your guys went
a little heavy

1258
01:21:41,626 --> 01:21:42,627
on the accelerants.

1259
01:21:43,326 --> 01:21:44,927
I was lucky to get away
with half of that.

1260
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:48,165
I want the full amount, Harry.
One million, like we agreed.

1261
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:51,068
I thought this was about
stopping the Mannings?

1262
01:21:51,768 --> 01:21:54,738
Don't think you can fuck me
over like you did your crew.

1263
01:22:00,277 --> 01:22:02,311
Harry! What the fuck?

1264
01:22:02,313 --> 01:22:04,149
Fuck, man! Come on!

1265
01:22:07,818 --> 01:22:10,319
Open the door!
Open the fucking door!

1266
01:22:10,321 --> 01:22:11,589
Harry!

1267
01:22:15,326 --> 01:22:17,362
Harry!
You piece of shit!

1268
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:47,692
I want that money.

1269
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,761
I can get your money,
but I need time.

1270
01:22:52,763 --> 01:22:53,898
Before the election.

1271
01:22:55,599 --> 01:22:56,700
If not...

1272
01:22:57,568 --> 01:22:59,204
you're gonna be alive again.

1273
01:22:59,937 --> 01:23:01,573
In all the worst ways.

1274
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,721
You hungry?

1275
01:24:14,578 --> 01:24:16,945
I told you, after
school I was taking the car,

1276
01:24:16,947 --> 01:24:18,549
and you didn't say anything.

1277
01:24:19,283 --> 01:24:22,786
Mom heard me. Dad,
Dad, ask her. Mom heard me.

1278
01:24:23,687 --> 01:24:26,457
How is it my fault
if you left it in the car?

1279
01:24:31,828 --> 01:24:33,398
How would I even...

1280
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:36,966
Can I just bring it
home to you later?

1281
01:24:37,434 --> 01:24:39,467
Dad, I'm really about
to miss, like, half the game

1282
01:24:39,469 --> 01:24:40,971
if I have to turn around now.

1283
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,507
I'm not saying
it's more important

1284
01:24:45,509 --> 01:24:46,910
than your anniversary.

1285
01:24:47,277 --> 01:24:49,413
I'm already on my way back
right now, Dad.

1286
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,579
I'll be there in, like,
15 minutes or something.

1287
01:24:52,581 --> 01:24:55,319
Oh, fuck!

1288
01:24:56,452 --> 01:24:58,187
<i>Dad, Dad, Dad, I...</i>

1289
01:24:58,856 --> 01:25:00,825
<i>Dad, I just got
pulled over now.</i>

1290
01:25:04,527 --> 01:25:06,895
- Dad, I gotta go.
- Get out of the car. Keep your

1291
01:25:06,897 --> 01:25:09,064
- hands where I can see them.
- I gotta go deal with this.

1292
01:25:09,066 --> 01:25:10,198
<i>Marcus!</i>

1293
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,036
- <i>Marcus! Marcus!</i>
- Oh, shit.

1294
01:25:12,368 --> 01:25:13,638
Hands where I can see them!

1295
01:25:14,904 --> 01:25:17,341
<i>Marcus! Marcus!</i>

1296
01:25:18,309 --> 01:25:19,577
<i>Marcus!</i>

1297
01:26:10,961 --> 01:26:12,496
Look what I found.

1298
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:15,865
So I have to go to Shanghai
for a few nights.

1299
01:26:15,867 --> 01:26:18,102
There's a site we're
thinking about developing.

1300
01:26:18,469 --> 01:26:19,670
You wanna come?

1301
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:22,872
To Shanghai?

1302
01:26:23,206 --> 01:26:24,474
You ever been?

1303
01:26:24,841 --> 01:26:25,975
Uh, no.

1304
01:26:26,276 --> 01:26:27,612
No. When?

1305
01:26:27,944 --> 01:26:28,979
Tomorrow.

1306
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:30,848
I can't.

1307
01:26:31,849 --> 01:26:32,849
You can't?

1308
01:26:33,617 --> 01:26:34,883
I got commitments here.

1309
01:26:34,885 --> 01:26:37,922
I can't just drop everything
and fly to Shanghai.

1310
01:26:38,322 --> 01:26:39,924
My life's
different than yours.

1311
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:42,022
It seems to me
if you can ask me

1312
01:26:42,024 --> 01:26:44,428
to get the address
off a permit, which I did,

1313
01:26:44,627 --> 01:26:46,794
then I can certainly ask you
to ditch your commitments

1314
01:26:46,796 --> 01:26:49,200
and fly with me to Shanghai
for a few days.

1315
01:26:50,567 --> 01:26:52,970
Or do overseas adventures
cost more?

1316
01:26:54,772 --> 01:26:56,607
Is everything
just a transaction?

1317
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:58,774
They brought us these drinks,

1318
01:26:58,776 --> 01:27:00,109
next they're gonna
bring us the bill.

1319
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:02,647
It's the way the world works,
as far as I'm concerned.

1320
01:27:07,017 --> 01:27:08,085
Sorry.

1321
01:27:12,523 --> 01:27:13,925
Next time.

1322
01:27:19,964 --> 01:27:21,131
Is that the one?

1323
01:27:22,299 --> 01:27:23,501
Yep.

1324
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:42,883
- Hey, Xavy.
- Hi.

1325
01:27:42,885 --> 01:27:45,089
- Thank God.
- Smells good.

1326
01:27:45,356 --> 01:27:46,887
It's almost done. You hungry?

1327
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:47,821
Yeah.

1328
01:27:47,823 --> 01:27:49,857
Mom, can I set
the table for Belle?

1329
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:50,894
Yes.

1330
01:27:52,429 --> 01:27:53,796
You don't have to run, you know.

1331
01:27:53,798 --> 01:27:55,998
Don't worry. I'd rather
be here on your dime

1332
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,603
than sitting on that damn bus,
not making any money.

1333
01:28:03,706 --> 01:28:05,876
Belle, can you drive?

1334
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:07,810
Why?

1335
01:28:10,548 --> 01:28:11,749
Solved our problem.

1336
01:28:12,616 --> 01:28:14,682
- What's this?
- This is Belle.

1337
01:28:14,684 --> 01:28:17,622
She's fast, she's smart,
and she can drive.

1338
01:28:19,223 --> 01:28:20,454
Come on. We can't do this,

1339
01:28:20,456 --> 01:28:21,957
the three of us.
We need a driver.

1340
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,859
This is not your place.
Please ask her to leave.

1341
01:28:23,861 --> 01:28:25,393
I'm standing here.
You can talk to me.

1342
01:28:25,395 --> 01:28:26,962
- I don't know you.
- You don't have to.

1343
01:28:26,964 --> 01:28:28,430
I'm happy to leave right now.

1344
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:30,100
Wait. We need a driver.

1345
01:28:38,843 --> 01:28:40,609
You girls happy
to split your cut?

1346
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:42,013
Split our cut?

1347
01:28:42,545 --> 01:28:43,981
It's equal or nothing.

1348
01:28:45,549 --> 01:28:46,713
You vouch for her?

1349
01:28:46,715 --> 01:28:48,251
I don't require a vouch.

1350
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:51,755
- We're gonna need another gun.
- I got my own.

1351
01:28:52,857 --> 01:28:54,792
You need to watch
how you talk to me.

1352
01:28:56,859 --> 01:28:59,796
If you're in, we need
to get you started right away.

1353
01:29:53,983 --> 01:29:55,151
Expecting someone?

1354
01:29:55,385 --> 01:29:57,585
You never can be
too sure in this neighborhood.

1355
01:29:57,755 --> 01:30:00,724
My gosh, how many security
guards do you have?

1356
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,893
Oh, just the one.

1357
01:30:05,129 --> 01:30:06,997
The neighborhood's
really changing.

1358
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:09,432
Yes, it is.

1359
01:30:09,698 --> 01:30:11,298
- Would you mind waiting here?
- No.

1360
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,267
Mr. Mulligan
should be free momentarily.

1361
01:30:13,269 --> 01:30:14,304
He's in a meeting.

1362
01:30:54,077 --> 01:30:56,913
We appreciate
your support. Bye-bye.

1363
01:31:07,491 --> 01:31:09,126
Excuse me,
can I help you?

1364
01:31:10,126 --> 01:31:11,726
I was just looking
for the bathroom,

1365
01:31:11,728 --> 01:31:13,427
and I was just
admiring this map.

1366
01:31:13,429 --> 01:31:14,430
Sure. You are?

1367
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:16,664
I have a meeting
with Jack Mulligan.

1368
01:31:16,666 --> 01:31:18,333
Ma'am, there's
a restroom downstairs.

1369
01:31:18,335 --> 01:31:19,804
I can show you the way.

1370
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:48,274
You got a weak bladder
or something?

1371
01:31:48,298 --> 01:31:50,131
My wife told me
I need to drink

1372
01:31:50,133 --> 01:31:52,001
eight glasses of water a day.
I guess...

1373
01:31:58,843 --> 01:31:59,941
I'll tell you exactly why

1374
01:31:59,943 --> 01:32:01,612
I fired your campaign manager.

1375
01:32:01,978 --> 01:32:03,712
He told me we would get
the endorsement of Wheeler

1376
01:32:03,714 --> 01:32:06,216
and now the good reverend has
decided to sit this one out.

1377
01:32:06,884 --> 01:32:08,216
He doesn't get to do that.

1378
01:32:08,218 --> 01:32:10,821
Oh.
Let me get this straight.

1379
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,022
You fire Hillsman.

1380
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:16,559
He's been working with
our family for 30 years.

1381
01:32:16,926 --> 01:32:18,728
So you just
put a bullet in him.

1382
01:32:19,263 --> 01:32:23,499
When the polls drop to, what,
three percent? Why? Why?

1383
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:25,999
I got a new guy coming on.
Black guy. British.

1384
01:32:26,001 --> 01:32:28,602
Black guy? Oh, really?
A black guy.

1385
01:32:28,604 --> 01:32:29,736
Gavin Cunningham.

1386
01:32:29,738 --> 01:32:31,308
- What?
- Gavin Cunningham.

1387
01:32:31,907 --> 01:32:33,275
Fuck me and fuck him!

1388
01:32:33,277 --> 01:32:36,645
Fuck you and fuck the fucking
horse you came in on!

1389
01:32:36,647 --> 01:32:38,480
You fucking asshole!

1390
01:32:38,482 --> 01:32:40,615
What a fucking
asshole you are!

1391
01:32:40,617 --> 01:32:42,419
Talk about loyalty. Hey!

1392
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,652
Maybe I'll call the mayor
and tell him

1393
01:32:44,654 --> 01:32:46,053
we gotta have
this election tomorrow,

1394
01:32:46,055 --> 01:32:48,022
- before things get any worse.
- You won't call the mayor.

1395
01:32:48,024 --> 01:32:49,824
I will take care of Manning
at the debate,

1396
01:32:49,826 --> 01:32:51,058
and that will be the end of it.

1397
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,460
Might I add,
running in your shadow

1398
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:53,673
would be a hell of a lot easier

1399
01:32:53,697 --> 01:32:56,164
if there weren't piles of shit
scattered everywhere I walk!

1400
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:59,066
Keep your fucking mouth shut,
or I'll fucking whip your ass!

1401
01:32:59,068 --> 01:33:00,101
Today!

1402
01:33:00,103 --> 01:33:02,473
I can still do it. Believe me.

1403
01:33:03,139 --> 01:33:04,140
Okay?

1404
01:33:06,242 --> 01:33:07,743
JFK, huh?

1405
01:33:08,045 --> 01:33:09,578
You think you're gonna
make things better.

1406
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,860
They're not gonna be any better.

1407
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:14,417
You think you're gonna change
things? Change them to what?

1408
01:33:14,885 --> 01:33:16,453
You're not gonna
change anything!

1409
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:19,456
They'll never change
under you.

1410
01:33:20,689 --> 01:33:21,923
The only thing that matters

1411
01:33:21,925 --> 01:33:23,994
is that we survive.
That's all.

1412
01:33:24,894 --> 01:33:26,860
Look around you.
It's like Custer's Last Stand.

1413
01:33:26,862 --> 01:33:28,298
It's kill or be killed.

1414
01:33:30,032 --> 01:33:31,500
Now, listen to me, son.

1415
01:33:32,068 --> 01:33:34,235
Listen, we made this city.

1416
01:33:34,237 --> 01:33:35,971
We're not having it
taken away from us

1417
01:33:35,973 --> 01:33:38,209
by people
who come here illegally...

1418
01:33:39,242 --> 01:33:41,212
or by people who can't stop,
you know...

1419
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,248
making babies.

1420
01:33:44,615 --> 01:33:46,483
That means staying in power...

1421
01:33:46,983 --> 01:33:49,286
at all costs. You got that?

1422
01:33:49,685 --> 01:33:50,685
Yeah?

1423
01:33:50,987 --> 01:33:52,523
You listen to me, Father.

1424
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:57,227
I'm looking forward to the day
when all this bullshit is over

1425
01:33:57,861 --> 01:34:00,197
and I don't have to talk
to people like you.

1426
01:34:05,335 --> 01:34:06,537
Because...

1427
01:34:10,307 --> 01:34:12,242
Because you won't be
here anymore.

1428
01:34:19,616 --> 01:34:20,649
My son.

1429
01:34:23,086 --> 01:34:24,087
Boy.

1430
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:33,229
- You finished?
- Yeah.

1431
01:34:33,697 --> 01:34:34,697
Okay.

1432
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,001
Now, hear me.

1433
01:34:39,969 --> 01:34:42,371
Tell your redheaded
paperweight here...

1434
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:46,242
to call Hillsman,
and hire him back.

1435
01:34:46,843 --> 01:34:48,075
Okay?

1436
01:34:48,077 --> 01:34:52,146
He's gonna make this
Gavin whatever, whoever,

1437
01:34:52,148 --> 01:34:54,418
your debate prep consultant.

1438
01:34:59,255 --> 01:35:02,291
You need to pick up your toys,
put them back in the box.

1439
01:35:02,826 --> 01:35:07,262
When you're done, we will
continue this conversation.

1440
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,432
Eh?

1441
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,467
Get the door.

1442
01:35:15,538 --> 01:35:16,706
My jacket.

1443
01:35:21,978 --> 01:35:24,110
- Who are you?
- I'm Veronica Rawlings.

1444
01:35:24,112 --> 01:35:25,112
We met a long time ago,

1445
01:35:25,282 --> 01:35:27,351
when I was lobbying
for the teachers' union.

1446
01:35:28,684 --> 01:35:32,152
I hope you can teach my son
better than I did.

1447
01:35:32,154 --> 01:35:34,387
Mrs. Rawlings, I don't think
you're on my schedule today.

1448
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:36,024
I'm not sure
I have the time to sit.

1449
01:35:36,026 --> 01:35:38,191
You do. You absolutely do.

1450
01:35:38,193 --> 01:35:40,496
She's from the teachers'
union. All right?

1451
01:35:41,298 --> 01:35:43,597
Yeah, let's go.
We're leaving. Okay.

1452
01:35:43,599 --> 01:35:44,766
Sorry to interrupt,

1453
01:35:44,768 --> 01:35:45,888
- Mr. Mulligan.
- Yeah?

1454
01:35:46,202 --> 01:35:48,070
Taking the car to the garage.
I'll be back in a few hours.

1455
01:35:48,072 --> 01:35:50,307
Sure, John. Just see
Siobhan before you leave.

1456
01:35:50,874 --> 01:35:52,509
Mrs. Rawlings, please come in.

1457
01:36:04,321 --> 01:36:05,455
Hmm.

1458
01:36:05,688 --> 01:36:06,722
I know that guy.

1459
01:36:06,923 --> 01:36:08,325
Seen him at the salon.

1460
01:36:13,229 --> 01:36:15,665
<i>When was the last
time you saw my husband?</i>

1461
01:36:16,765 --> 01:36:18,501
Before he died?

1462
01:36:19,068 --> 01:36:20,770
It was a while.
I can't remember.

1463
01:36:21,438 --> 01:36:22,606
Why do you ask?

1464
01:36:24,174 --> 01:36:26,276
Jamal Manning threatened me.

1465
01:36:27,876 --> 01:36:29,745
He says Harry stole from him,

1466
01:36:29,946 --> 01:36:31,548
and he presented me
with the bill.

1467
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:34,147
He wants his money.

1468
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:35,618
I'm not sure I follow.

1469
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:39,052
From what I understand,

1470
01:36:39,054 --> 01:36:41,124
we both have
a Jamal Manning problem.

1471
01:36:42,959 --> 01:36:44,327
You don't...

1472
01:36:45,629 --> 01:36:49,099
You don't live in my ward,
Mrs. Rawlings.

1473
01:36:49,799 --> 01:36:51,399
But if you're aware of a crime,

1474
01:36:51,401 --> 01:36:52,633
you should really
go to the police.

1475
01:36:52,635 --> 01:36:55,505
Mr. Mulligan, you said
whenever I needed help.

1476
01:36:55,705 --> 01:36:58,807
Now, your family's been involved
in Harry's life for many years.

1477
01:36:58,809 --> 01:36:59,975
When I say help...

1478
01:36:59,977 --> 01:37:02,345
- I mean help.
- I understand, but...

1479
01:37:03,612 --> 01:37:04,947
I'm not my father.

1480
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:08,619
As you can see, the years
have taken a toll on him...

1481
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:11,387
and I do not want to go down
that same road.

1482
01:37:12,956 --> 01:37:14,856
So with much
admiration and respect

1483
01:37:14,858 --> 01:37:18,262
for your late husband
and yourself, of course...

1484
01:37:19,395 --> 01:37:20,798
I don't see what I can do.

1485
01:37:23,633 --> 01:37:25,736
What I've learned
from men like my father...

1486
01:37:26,469 --> 01:37:27,538
and Harry...

1487
01:37:28,336 --> 01:37:30,174
is that you reap what you sow.

1488
01:37:34,678 --> 01:37:36,113
Let's hope so.

1489
01:37:50,294 --> 01:37:52,459
That guy who was here,
in the suit, who is he?

1490
01:37:52,461 --> 01:37:54,195
I told you, I don't want you
to get involved.

1491
01:37:54,197 --> 01:37:55,495
What do you mean?

1492
01:37:55,497 --> 01:37:56,899
He works for someone.

1493
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:58,401
So who really owns this salon?

1494
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,801
How is that
any of your business?

1495
01:37:59,803 --> 01:38:01,535
What doesn't bother you
doesn't trouble you.

1496
01:38:01,537 --> 01:38:03,339
Mm-hmm.
- Jack Mulligan?

1497
01:38:09,278 --> 01:38:10,647
He empowered me.

1498
01:38:11,081 --> 01:38:13,780
I am a female minority
business owner.

1499
01:38:13,782 --> 01:38:16,083
But the powers that be
take a very healthy cut.

1500
01:38:16,085 --> 01:38:17,217
So why do you stand for it?

1501
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:19,520
Where exactly would you
like me to stand?

1502
01:38:19,522 --> 01:38:20,955
I needed money
to start a business,

1503
01:38:20,957 --> 01:38:22,490
he gave it to me,
and now I owe him.

1504
01:38:22,492 --> 01:38:24,792
No bank was gonna give me
any money. He did.

1505
01:38:24,794 --> 01:38:26,727
All I wanted to do was
have a business of my own

1506
01:38:26,729 --> 01:38:28,396
and this way I'm allowed
to think I have one.

1507
01:38:28,398 --> 01:38:30,343
Does that sound right to you?
Because it doesn't sound right

1508
01:38:30,367 --> 01:38:31,600
- to me.
- You got a customer

1509
01:38:31,602 --> 01:38:32,603
right over there.

1510
01:38:44,514 --> 01:38:46,079
Two of the three
cameras at the back

1511
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:47,214
are covered
by the construction.

1512
01:38:47,216 --> 01:38:48,216
Mm-hmm.

1513
01:38:48,518 --> 01:38:50,016
And what about
the codes for the safe room?

1514
01:38:50,018 --> 01:38:51,253
Veronica's on it.

1515
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,286
Why isn't she here?
Why are we

1516
01:38:53,288 --> 01:38:54,622
- doing this by ourselves?
- I don't know.

1517
01:38:54,624 --> 01:38:56,593
Why are we doing this anyway?

1518
01:38:56,992 --> 01:38:58,528
Wait, who's
watching your kids?

1519
01:38:59,862 --> 01:39:00,896
My mom.

1520
01:39:01,264 --> 01:39:02,430
So while you were
sitting her kids,

1521
01:39:02,432 --> 01:39:03,664
your mom was
watching your daughter?

1522
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:05,502
I work two jobs.
What do you do for money?

1523
01:39:06,569 --> 01:39:07,904
I had Florek.

1524
01:39:11,241 --> 01:39:12,475
I had a business.

1525
01:39:12,675 --> 01:39:14,244
Did you know
what they did?

1526
01:39:14,777 --> 01:39:16,212
I thought I did.

1527
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,715
If I asked, he'd hit me.

1528
01:39:20,283 --> 01:39:22,518
After a job, though,
he was nice.

1529
01:39:25,721 --> 01:39:28,455
What about Veronica?
You think she knew?

1530
01:39:28,457 --> 01:39:30,826
I bet
she knew everything.

1531
01:39:31,126 --> 01:39:33,361
"You girls
happy to split your cut?"

1532
01:39:33,595 --> 01:39:36,297
What about this? "You
vouch for her?"

1533
01:39:36,299 --> 01:39:37,464
She'd be a lot nicer if she

1534
01:39:37,466 --> 01:39:39,299
just took that stick
out of her ass.

1535
01:39:39,301 --> 01:39:41,337
You know why
we need a new driver?

1536
01:39:42,205 --> 01:39:43,807
The last one was killed.

1537
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:49,879
So if you're not serious...

1538
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:08,365
If this whole thing
goes wrong...

1539
01:40:08,865 --> 01:40:10,196
I just want my kids to know

1540
01:40:10,198 --> 01:40:11,835
that I didn't sit there
and take it.

1541
01:40:12,868 --> 01:40:14,237
I did something.

1542
01:40:21,877 --> 01:40:23,979
<i>Our go date
is in three days.</i>

1543
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,949
The night of the debate.

1544
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:28,548
Now, all of our work
is worth nothing

1545
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:30,553
if we don't move
this money and fast.

1546
01:40:30,819 --> 01:40:33,119
The notebook says
five million dollars.

1547
01:40:33,121 --> 01:40:34,789
That's exactly
the amount of money

1548
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,326
Mulligan was accused of taking
in commission kickbacks.

1549
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:39,793
So over here we have
two million dollars.

1550
01:40:39,795 --> 01:40:40,795
Twenty Tupperware boxes.

1551
01:40:40,863 --> 01:40:43,998
Each box has 100,000 dollars
in 100-dollar bills.

1552
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,401
It weighs 44 pounds.

1553
01:40:45,701 --> 01:40:47,868
Now, over here we have
two million dollars.

1554
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:49,036
Forty Tupperware boxes.

1555
01:40:49,038 --> 01:40:52,073
Each box has 50,000 dollars
in 50-dollar bills.

1556
01:40:52,075 --> 01:40:53,374
It weighs 88 pounds.

1557
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,674
I feel like I'm in school.

1558
01:40:54,676 --> 01:40:56,476
- Tell me about it.
- Okay, Linda.

1559
01:40:56,478 --> 01:40:57,911
That bag has the weight of

1560
01:40:57,913 --> 01:40:59,747
two million dollars
in hundred-dollar bills.

1561
01:40:59,749 --> 01:41:00,749
Put it on.

1562
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:08,191
All right.

1563
01:41:08,524 --> 01:41:10,359
Run to the back
of that van and back.

1564
01:41:14,697 --> 01:41:17,499
This is nothing.
All that for this?

1565
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:19,167
- Now, Belle...
- That was easy.

1566
01:41:19,169 --> 01:41:20,170
Put that on.

1567
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:22,236
Watch you back.
Bend your knees.

1568
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:24,174
Okay, run to the back
of the van and back.

1569
01:41:24,741 --> 01:41:27,173
Come on! Come on!

1570
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:29,709
It's not funny now, is it?

1571
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:31,212
And it won't be
if we get caught.

1572
01:41:31,214 --> 01:41:34,818
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on, run!

1573
01:41:35,285 --> 01:41:37,120
Get this thing
off of me.

1574
01:41:37,487 --> 01:41:39,820
Now, that bag had double
the weight of before.

1575
01:41:39,822 --> 01:41:41,088
Why the fuck
would you do that?

1576
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:43,123
Because I had to think
of the best-case scenario

1577
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:44,357
and the worst-case scenario.

1578
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:46,161
We gotta move fast.

1579
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,229
We gotta start thinking
like professionals.

1580
01:41:49,231 --> 01:41:50,867
We're in business together.

1581
01:41:51,501 --> 01:41:53,303
There's not gonna be
some cozy reunion.

1582
01:41:53,736 --> 01:41:56,038
After this job, we're done.

1583
01:41:57,541 --> 01:42:00,210
We have three days to look
and move like a team of men.

1584
01:42:00,876 --> 01:42:04,080
The best thing we have going
for us is being who we are.

1585
01:42:04,613 --> 01:42:05,613
Why?

1586
01:42:06,182 --> 01:42:09,452
Because no one thinks we have
the balls to pull this off.

1587
01:42:21,231 --> 01:42:22,698
Can I ask you a question?

1588
01:42:23,066 --> 01:42:25,736
As long as I can answer it
and still get to my meeting.

1589
01:42:26,536 --> 01:42:28,605
How come we
never go to your place?

1590
01:42:29,339 --> 01:42:30,707
My place?

1591
01:42:31,407 --> 01:42:32,606
That's your question?

1592
01:42:32,608 --> 01:42:34,109
I'd like to see how you live.

1593
01:42:34,477 --> 01:42:36,546
I could cook you dinner.
We could watch some TV.

1594
01:42:37,412 --> 01:42:39,914
Look, I really,
really like you, Alice.

1595
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:41,882
I don't think I've ever been
this happy with a woman.

1596
01:42:41,884 --> 01:42:44,587
I truly do care about you.
I really do.

1597
01:42:45,188 --> 01:42:46,690
But I'm not your husband.

1598
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,725
I know you're not.

1599
01:42:54,162 --> 01:42:57,698
Look, this is an arrangement,
okay? It's not a marriage.

1600
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,201
I pay for things, and outta
that, you get a nice life.

1601
01:43:01,203 --> 01:43:03,106
I don't need you
to have a nice life.

1602
01:43:04,174 --> 01:43:05,705
Look, if I ended things
right now,

1603
01:43:05,707 --> 01:43:07,007
what would you do for money?

1604
01:43:07,009 --> 01:43:08,011
Excuse me?

1605
01:43:08,611 --> 01:43:10,476
My money, the way I live.

1606
01:43:10,478 --> 01:43:11,857
I'm offering you
a nice life, Alice.

1607
01:43:11,881 --> 01:43:14,984
You say "a life" like it's yours
to offer. But it's mine.

1608
01:43:16,018 --> 01:43:18,921
It's mine to be ashamed of
or be proud of.

1609
01:43:19,322 --> 01:43:21,290
Mine to fuck up or make good.
It's mine.

1610
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:23,626
I don't have time for this
right now, okay?

1611
01:43:24,493 --> 01:43:25,862
I have to go.

1612
01:43:28,264 --> 01:43:29,699
Can I drop you somewhere?

1613
01:43:32,201 --> 01:43:33,569
I'll get where I need to go.

1614
01:43:56,358 --> 01:43:57,891
It's over.
It was a mistake.

1615
01:43:57,893 --> 01:43:59,459
I know the codes
change every day.

1616
01:43:59,461 --> 01:44:00,794
I need those codes, Ken.

1617
01:44:00,796 --> 01:44:02,932
I thought I was off the hook
now Harry's dead.

1618
01:44:03,633 --> 01:44:05,833
It'll be the third time
my alarm systems get hit.

1619
01:44:05,835 --> 01:44:07,002
People are asking questions.

1620
01:44:07,202 --> 01:44:08,004
You should have thought twice

1621
01:44:08,203 --> 01:44:09,704
before cheating
on your wife with your niece.

1622
01:44:09,706 --> 01:44:10,805
You made a choice.

1623
01:44:10,807 --> 01:44:12,039
Now, I'll go wait
at the gas station.

1624
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:13,775
If you drive away,
I know you're out.

1625
01:44:13,777 --> 01:44:16,179
If you come to me
with the codes...

1626
01:44:17,313 --> 01:44:18,712
maybe you have a future.

1627
01:44:18,714 --> 01:44:21,551
Please, I'm begging you
as a human being.

1628
01:44:21,984 --> 01:44:24,587
Please! I can't!

1629
01:44:26,354 --> 01:44:27,624
Please!

1630
01:44:35,932 --> 01:44:38,031
<i>I'd like two return tickets.</i>

1631
01:44:55,951 --> 01:44:58,020
<i>The polls say
you're gonna win.</i>

1632
01:44:58,688 --> 01:45:01,658
<i>So before you come out swingin'
at the debate tonight...</i>

1633
01:45:03,826 --> 01:45:06,629
What if I stop spending
money on advertising?

1634
01:45:07,964 --> 01:45:10,834
You know, level the playing
field, so to speak.

1635
01:45:11,733 --> 01:45:13,534
I stop making appearances,

1636
01:45:13,536 --> 01:45:15,705
scale back my
"get out the vote" program.

1637
01:45:16,372 --> 01:45:17,607
Make some calls.

1638
01:45:19,608 --> 01:45:20,943
Jamal Manning...

1639
01:45:21,745 --> 01:45:25,549
the first African American
alderman of the 18th ward.

1640
01:45:27,883 --> 01:45:29,650
And I'd be there to advise you,

1641
01:45:29,652 --> 01:45:31,585
you know,
on every important matter.

1642
01:45:31,587 --> 01:45:32,887
Behind the scenes, of course.

1643
01:45:32,889 --> 01:45:34,724
As far as everyone else
is concerned...

1644
01:45:35,524 --> 01:45:36,792
Jamal...

1645
01:45:37,660 --> 01:45:38,894
you the man.

1646
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:46,602
Think about it.

1647
01:45:51,206 --> 01:45:52,841
Not offering you charity.

1648
01:45:53,675 --> 01:45:55,178
I'm offering you power.

1649
01:45:55,711 --> 01:45:56,912
On whose terms?

1650
01:45:58,447 --> 01:45:59,816
You decide.

1651
01:46:02,484 --> 01:46:03,752
See you at the debate.

1652
01:46:06,054 --> 01:46:08,258
Oh, and send my best
to the Reverend Wheeler.

1653
01:47:19,395 --> 01:47:20,763
Everybody ready?

1654
01:47:21,296 --> 01:47:22,765
You got the codes?

1655
01:47:27,702 --> 01:47:29,205
Something goes wrong...

1656
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:32,841
you're all on your own.

1657
01:47:34,277 --> 01:47:35,879
I'm gonna go get ready.

1658
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,221
<i>Each candidate has</i>

1659
01:47:47,223 --> 01:47:48,856
<i>three minutes to give
an opening statement.</i>

1660
01:47:48,858 --> 01:47:51,225
<i>Mr. Mulligan, you're up first.</i>

1661
01:47:52,527 --> 01:47:53,862
<i>You all know me.</i>

1662
01:47:54,096 --> 01:47:56,633
<i>I'm a proud
sixth generation Chicagoan.</i>

1663
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,165
<i>We laugh louder,
we work harder,</i>

1664
01:47:59,167 --> 01:48:01,036
<i>we sleep to the rattle
of the "L" train.</i>

1665
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:08,109
Hey!

1666
01:48:08,344 --> 01:48:09,813
- Hey!
- Go.

1667
01:48:27,263 --> 01:48:28,430
Let's go.

1668
01:49:29,157 --> 01:49:31,460
<i>Put your
fuckin' hands in the air.</i>

1669
01:49:33,062 --> 01:49:36,265
<i>Hurry up.
Don't even think about it.</i>

1670
01:49:36,666 --> 01:49:37,967
<i>Get down!</i>

1671
01:49:38,201 --> 01:49:39,566
<i>Get down!</i>

1672
01:49:40,836 --> 01:49:42,580
<i>Take his gun! Take his gun!</i>

1673
01:50:40,828 --> 01:50:41,962
<i>How do you know</i>

1674
01:50:41,964 --> 01:50:43,164
<i>she's not gonna call the cops?</i>

1675
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:45,001
<i>She's not that stupid.</i>

1676
01:50:55,745 --> 01:50:56,944
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1677
01:50:56,946 --> 01:50:58,448
<i>What the fuck is wrong?</i>

1678
01:50:59,549 --> 01:51:00,780
<i>Shit.</i>

1679
01:51:00,782 --> 01:51:02,151
<i>Hang on.</i>

1680
01:51:02,518 --> 01:51:03,987
<i>It's upside down.</i>

1681
01:51:10,693 --> 01:51:12,161
<i>Come on.</i>

1682
01:51:24,206 --> 01:51:27,610
<i>Hey, I got the hundreds
right over here.</i>

1683
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:29,512
<i>Come on.</i>

1684
01:51:32,281 --> 01:51:33,646
<i>How much time
do we have?</i>

1685
01:51:33,648 --> 01:51:35,317
<i>Just get it done.</i>

1686
01:52:09,385 --> 01:52:12,088
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

1687
01:52:13,389 --> 01:52:14,389
Hands in the air!

1688
01:52:15,057 --> 01:52:17,259
Drop your weapons!
Hands in the air!

1689
01:52:17,593 --> 01:52:20,662
What, are you takin' my money?
Who the fuck are you?

1690
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:23,131
You're...

1691
01:52:33,008 --> 01:52:34,676
Let me have the gun.

1692
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:39,615
<i>Get him off me.</i>

1693
01:52:40,249 --> 01:52:42,151
<i>Get him the fuck off me.</i>

1694
01:52:43,786 --> 01:52:45,455
<i>It's your shoulder.</i>

1695
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:50,393
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>

1696
01:53:04,038 --> 01:53:05,375
<i>Go!</i>

1697
01:53:05,808 --> 01:53:07,010
Go!

1698
01:53:22,157 --> 01:53:24,160
<i>But why do we have to?</i>

1699
01:53:24,527 --> 01:53:29,628
<i>Chicago is a city in free fall.
Money, greed, avarice.</i>

1700
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:33,499
<i>Fat cats in city hall
getting fatter on our meals.</i>

1701
01:53:33,501 --> 01:53:34,601
<i>Yeah.</i>

1702
01:53:34,603 --> 01:53:38,138
<i>We, the people,
are not people to them.</i>

1703
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:41,874
<i>We are a mass of ugly need
they don't want to see.</i>

1704
01:53:41,876 --> 01:53:44,410
<i>Let us have a chance at life.</i>

1705
01:53:44,412 --> 01:53:46,113
<i>Not just to exist,
but to live.</i>

1706
01:53:46,115 --> 01:53:48,015
Get him, bro. You call
that motherfucker out!

1707
01:53:48,017 --> 01:53:50,618
<i>Let us live!</i>

1708
01:54:06,635 --> 01:54:08,271
Okay.

1709
01:54:09,804 --> 01:54:11,673
Pass it on! Pass it on!

1710
01:54:22,084 --> 01:54:23,318
Go!

1711
01:54:30,192 --> 01:54:32,391
- How's she doin'?
- She's losing blood.

1712
01:54:32,393 --> 01:54:34,328
You gotta stay awake.

1713
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:35,829
You gotta keep her conscious.

1714
01:54:35,831 --> 01:54:36,797
Stay up. Listen.

1715
01:54:36,799 --> 01:54:38,332
- Shit. All right.
- I don't know

1716
01:54:38,334 --> 01:54:39,999
- if I should put pressure.
- Okay, you're okay.

1717
01:54:40,001 --> 01:54:41,235
- Oh, my God.
- Where is it?

1718
01:54:41,237 --> 01:54:42,436
She's bleeding
all over the place.

1719
01:54:42,438 --> 01:54:43,969
- You're okay.
- You need to stay awake.

1720
01:54:43,971 --> 01:54:45,331
Come on, Alice.
You're okay.

1721
01:54:45,808 --> 01:54:49,045
You guys take off.
I'm gonna stay with her.

1722
01:54:49,478 --> 01:54:51,681
Almost there.

1723
01:55:00,421 --> 01:55:02,622
No. No, no, no. No, no.

1724
01:55:02,624 --> 01:55:03,792
Help!

1725
01:55:04,559 --> 01:55:05,559
Help!

1726
01:55:06,094 --> 01:55:08,531
She's been shot.
It's a drive-by.

1727
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:10,930
She lost a lot of blood.

1728
01:55:10,932 --> 01:55:12,367
What's your name?

1729
01:55:12,867 --> 01:55:14,000
What's your name, ma'am?

1730
01:55:14,002 --> 01:55:16,572
Her name's Jennifer.

1731
01:56:50,832 --> 01:56:51,832
Yeah.

1732
01:56:57,139 --> 01:56:58,774
It was meant to be simple.

1733
01:57:03,711 --> 01:57:06,946
Why couldn't you just
sell the book to Jamal

1734
01:57:06,948 --> 01:57:08,347
and leave it at that, Ronnie?

1735
01:57:08,349 --> 01:57:09,749
You're not supposed
to be here.

1736
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:12,787
You left me alone,
you evil bastard.

1737
01:57:13,255 --> 01:57:14,588
Wanted to start a new life

1738

with your new son,
your new white, happy family.

1739
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:20,496
I couldn't save him, Ronnie!

1740
01:57:21,063 --> 01:57:22,832
I couldn't save us!

1741
01:57:25,201 --> 01:57:28,037
I had to save me!
Me!

1742
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:30,006
You're a fucking coward!

1743
01:57:33,843 --> 01:57:35,411
I need that money, Ronnie.

1744
01:57:43,484 --> 01:57:44,985
I need the money.

Okay.

1768
02:00:51,372 --> 02:00:53,707
Come on, open!
Come on! Come on!

1769
02:00:53,709 --> 02:00:55,508
Come on, open it!

1770
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:56,945
Yeah!

1771
02:00:57,345 --> 02:00:58,946
Come on.

1772
02:00:59,348 --> 02:01:02,281
Come on.
You're not getting it.

1773
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:07,520
No! No!

1774
02:01:07,522 --> 02:01:09,158
I'm gonna get you!

1775
02:01:13,027 --> 02:01:14,896
Stop!

1776
02:01:16,197 --> 02:01:17,797
What are you doing?

1777
02:01:17,799 --> 02:01:19,633
We're bubble fighting.

1778
02:01:19,635 --> 02:01:20,736
Yeah!

1779
02:01:33,447 --> 02:01:34,847
- Hi.
- Just one?

1780
02:01:34,849 --> 02:01:36,051
Uh, two.

1781
02:01:39,353 --> 02:01:41,655
- This okay?
- Great, thanks.

1782
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:43,588
Can I get you
something to drink?

1783
02:01:43,590 --> 02:01:45,126
Some coffee, please.

1784
02:01:58,974 --> 02:02:00,705
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

1785
02:02:00,707 --> 02:02:02,775
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

1786
02:02:02,777 --> 02:02:05,946
It is crazy out there.
Driving like crazy people.

1787
02:02:06,447 --> 02:02:09,015
You beat me, of course,
as always. I'm always late.

1788
02:02:09,017 --> 02:02:10,816
I'm so sorry. Did I tell you
about my neighbors?

1789
02:02:10,818 --> 02:02:12,317
They're already putting out
their lawn chairs

1790
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:13,485
and the kitchen chairs...

1791
02:02:13,487 --> 02:02:14,588
Thank you so much.

1792
02:02:14,856 --> 02:02:16,856
In preparation for
the winter, and it's like...

1793
02:02:16,858 --> 02:02:20,895
"Come on, you guys.
The season is just starting."

1794
02:02:29,638 --> 02:02:31,040
Are you okay?

1795
02:02:31,506 --> 02:02:32,741
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1796
02:02:32,974 --> 02:02:35,275
Anyway, they were,
like, already putting it out

1797
02:02:35,277 --> 02:02:36,575
and so John's really frustrated,

1798
02:02:36,577 --> 02:02:39,111
so he's gonna put some
of the lawn chairs

1799
02:02:39,113 --> 02:02:42,182
the kitchen chairs
back on the...

1800
02:02:52,961 --> 02:02:54,860
Mrs. Rawlings, I was
surprised to hear from you.

1801
02:02:54,862 --> 02:02:56,302
I want you to listen to me.

1802
02:02:57,866 --> 02:03:00,669
Underneath this table
is a bag of money.

1803
02:03:01,702 --> 02:03:03,636
I want you to use that money

1804
02:03:03,638 --> 02:03:05,741
to help rebuild
the school library.

1805
02:03:07,207 --> 02:03:08,376
All I ask...

1806
02:03:09,544 --> 02:03:11,080
name it after Marcus.

1807
02:03:28,296 --> 02:03:29,397
Alice?

1808
02:03:38,439 --> 02:03:39,875
How you been?
