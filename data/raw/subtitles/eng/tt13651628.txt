4

<i>Your avatar in U is called "AS."</i>

Suzu!

28
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,376
What's going on?

29
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,962
Nothing!

30
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,562
Do you want a ride?

31
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,564
No.

32
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,857
How about dinner?

33
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,442
No, thanks.

34
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,781
Okay. I'll see you later then.

38
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,004
<i>The biggest attention-getter

43
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,379
She's so pretty.

44
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,965
Luka is the school princess.

45
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,719
- Such long, slender legs.
- She looks like a model even in uniform.

46
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,763
- Totally.
- Totally.

47
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,891
The jealousy of girls
who aren't like her must be crazy.

48
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,017
Hiro...

49
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,313
It's no surprise she's our class leader.

50
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,316
She attracts people like the sun.

51
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,734
I know what you mean.

52
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,320
I'd be annoyed.

53
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,529
Lucky for you,

54
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,325
you're like the far side of the moon
that gets ignored.

55
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,118
Hiro...

56
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,956
Could you tone down
your wisecracks about me?

57
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
Join the canoe club!

58
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,544
Do you want to join the canoe club?

59
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,713
- Drop it, Kamishin.
- No thanks.

60
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,382
Hey! Want to go canoeing?

61
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,970
Kamishin is incredible.
He started the canoe club alone.

62
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,806
And he's the only member.

63
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,933
- Why is that?
- What do you mean?

64
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,017
Canoe!

65
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,436
Let's go canoeing!

66
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,190
Come back! Don't run away!

67
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,859
Putting it nicely,
people think he's a fool.

68
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:06,425
I never thought Shinobu would get so tall.

69
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,344
A childhood friend?

70
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,223
He proposed to me once.

71
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,017
Seriously? Like how?

72
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,395
He said, "Suzu, I'll protect you."

73
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,855
When?

74
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,106
We were six.

75
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,026
Come on, that was years ago.

76
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>Yes.</i>

77
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,958
<i>Something years ago.</i>

78
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,509
Help me!

79
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,514
Help!

80
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,307
Help!

81
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,855
Don't go! Mom, don't go!

82
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,650
I have to or she'll die.

83
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,239
Mom!

84
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,626
Mom...

85
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,838
Mom!

86
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,090
Mom!

87
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,229
Don't go, Mom...

88
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,231
Mom...

89
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,662
<i>She practically committed suicide
by jumping into the river.</i>

90
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,582
<i>Did she think
it'd be like swimming in a pool?</i>

91
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,501
<i>She died for some stranger's kid
and abandoned her own.</i>

92
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,088
<i>I don't want to play
in the river anymore because of her.</i>

93
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,008
<i>She shouldn't have tried to be a hero.</i>

94
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,862
<i>Why did Mom go into the river
and leave me behind?</i>

95
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,867
<i>Why was a stranger's life more
important than her life with me?</i>

96
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,787
<i>Why am I all alone?</i>

97
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,955
<i>Why?</i>

98
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,291
<i>Why?</i>

99
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,199
- Wait!
- Hurry up!

100
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,497
- No!
- Come on!

101
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,581
No...

102
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,506
Peggie Sue is so cute!

103
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,591
This is a big hit in U.

104
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,554
Go on.

- Sing!

107
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,019

- You can sing, right?

108
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,313

00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,112
<i>- Oddly pretty.
- What's this song called?</i>

185
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,449
<i>- No hits in searches.
- Crazy fashion.</i>

186
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,868
<i>- I'm hooked on her.
- Who knows more about Bell?</i>

187
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,662
{\an8}Bell?

188
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:10,417
{\an8}I've heard her sing
but she's nothing special.

189
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,585
{\an8}<i>Yeah!</i>

190
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,420
{\an8}<i>- Irritating voice.
- Too flashy.</i>

191
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
{\an8}<i>- Selling her sex appeal?
- Vulgar.</i>

192
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,590
<i>No basic music skills.</i>

193
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>- The arrangements are good, not her.
- Done by other people.</i>

194
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,762
<i>Take music seriously!</i>

195
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,973
<i>Still...</i>

196
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,601
<i>I can't stop listening to this song.</i>

197
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,518
<i>Why?</i>

198
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,770
<i>Why?</i>

199
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,189
<i>It feels like she's singing for me.</i>

200
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,149
<i>Like it's for my ears only.</i>

201
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,692
<i>No. For mine.</i>

202
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,694
<i>No. She's singing just for me.</i>

203
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,154
<i>- Why?
- Why?</i>

204
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,989
<i>- How come?
- Why?</i>

205
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,286
Have you heard of Bell?

206
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,497
Of course.

207
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,374
- Who's that?
- The girl in U, right?

208
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,042
She's so different.

209
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,220
Hello!

210
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,474
Hiro! Guess what happened! Bell...

211
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,937
I know. She made it
into the U Global Music Hits.

212
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,938
Just as I expected.

213
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,066
No! She's being roasted like crazy!

214
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,237
Also expected.
They're just jealous of you.

215
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,241
If you only get compliments,
you only have hard-core fans.

216
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,742
Minor league.

217
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,162
In U, stardom is built on mixed opinions.

218
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,749
Half of them don't like me? I want to die!

219
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,420
But the other half likes you.
Be more confident.

220
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,921
The secret to your success?

221
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,923
I look like Luka.

222
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,049
And?

223
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,760
The people who arrange my songs.

224
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,761
What else?

225
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,265
Your production. Costumes, dances, and...

226
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,059
No! Yes but no!

227
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,895
The biggest secret is that it's in U!

228
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,189
Its body-sharing technology draws out

229
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,691
the user's hidden strengths.

230
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,485
Without it, you wouldn't be singing

231
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,071
but crying all the time like usual.

232
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,865
Look at this.

233
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,075
Search for Bell's identity...

234
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,328
What? Oh, no!

235
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,289
It's funny how wrong they are.

236
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,416
They're naming all these celebrities.

237
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,043
So far from the truth.

238
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,211
It's not funny!

239
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,547
Nobody would ever guess

240
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,384
that Bell is a mousy
country bumpkin like you.

241
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,720
You're scary.

242
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,264
This is the best game ever.

243
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:34,102
Turning a nerdy, freckled schoolgirl
into U's superstar.

244
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,066
This could mean big money,
but don't worry.

245
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:43,153
I'll anonymously donate
every dollar to charities.

246
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:48,867
<i>Fly through this untold, nameless moment</i>

247
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,079
<i>Reaching out for the crescent moon</i>

248
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,539
<i>Bell is our new diva.</i>

249
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,794
<i>Isn't B-E-L-L-E more suitable for her?</i>

250
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,379
- <i>Belle?
- "Beautiful" in French.</i>

251
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,966
<i>A perfect name for a girl
who's not quite perfect.</i>

252
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,844
<i>Putting it mildly, Belle is the best!</i>

253
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:12,432
This has got to be a joke!
Why is she more popular than me?

254
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,892
{\an8}<i>- It's Peggie Sue.
- She's finished.</i>

255
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,104
What? Hey! Get away from me!

256
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,317
You jealous nobody!

257
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,070
Belle has changed the world!

258
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:30,325
More excitement! More spotlight!
Belle is the best!

259
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,664
What's so funny, Hiroka?

260
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,667
This room is off limits now.

261
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,097
CONGRATULATIONS, GRADUATES!

262
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,103
GRADUATION PERFORMANCES

263
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:21,042
We use the closed school buildings
for community activities.

264
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,087
Let's take a look over there.

265
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,721
Weird, huh? Practicing for a Christmas
concert with cicadas singing.

266
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,223
Come out and sing.

267
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,391
I can't.

268
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:40,020
Only a bell cricket
sings in the shadows like that.

269
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,022
I don't mind being a bell cricket.

270
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,357
The youngest member
should sing in the center.

271
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,358
I don't want to.

272
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,028
Kids these days lack ambition.

273
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,613
Don't you want to be happy?

274
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,033
I'm sure your mom wants you to be happy.

275
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,701
Happy? How?

276
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,537
How can I find happiness?

277
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,789
Well...

278
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,291
Happiness...

279
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,626
Happiness?

280
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,212
Happiness?

281
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:10,342
Even at this age,
I'm not sure what happiness is.

282
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,226
Why are you looking at us like that?

283
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,062
Trying to figure out who's right?

284
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,689
We wouldn't be so frustrated

285
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,442
if there was a right answer to happiness!

286
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,117
Why are you crying?

287
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,247
Why won't you say something?

288
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,631
Suzu.

289
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,884
Shinobu!

290
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,177
How's your dad?

291
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,346
Fine... I think...

292
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,724
You think? Are you eating properly?

293
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,934
Yeah...

294
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,186
What's the matter?

295
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,690
- Nothing.
- I don't believe you.

296
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,775
- I swear...
- Look at me.

297
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,152
I can't.

298
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,279
Look at me.

299
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,202
Tell me.

300
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,706
Tell me.

301
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,589
Suzu!

302
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:40,432
Shinobu, I'm not the girl
you knew in elementary school.

303
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,102
You don't have to worry about me...

304
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,854
anymore.

305
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,803
Coming up at U standard time 20:25,

306
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:23,183
Belle's biggest concert yet
in the spherical stadium.

307
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,935
Setting a record as a newcomer to U

308
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,521
she's expected to draw millions

309
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,273
and millions of viewers worldwide.

310
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,611
People are waiting
on the edge of their seats.

311
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,690
Thank you.

312
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,482
Belle, you're doing great. Next song.

313
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,566
Okay.

314
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,910
Who opened the dome?

315
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,622
Get out of here!

316
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,539
He's being chased?

317
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,717
Who is that?

318
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,135
<i>- The heck?
- The Beast.</i>

319
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,221
<i>- Dragon's here!
- It's the Dragon!</i>

320
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,138
Dragon?

321
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,766
<i>An ugly monster AS that lives in U.</i>

322
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,319
- Wow.
- Who is it?

323
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,322
<i>He suddenly appeared in the
martial arts arena a few months back.</i>

324
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,658
<i>And has been setting records ever since.</i>

325
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,660
<i>But he fights dirty.</i>

326
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,702
Like how?

327
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,210
Go!

328
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,008
<i>He ruins the matches.</i>

329
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,761
<i>He attacks until the data breaks down.</i>

330
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,763
<i>Like he's venting his anger.</i>

331
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,891
<i>He loves showing off
the bruises on his back.</i>

332
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,728
He's covered... in bruises.

333
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,990
Who's chasing him?

334
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,825
<i>- The Justices.</i>
- Justices?

335
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,203
<i>They claim to be the protectors
of justice and order in U.</i>

336
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,998
They do look like superheroes.

337
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,708
Oh, no!

338
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,726
How brutal!

339
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,686
You've taken this too far!

340
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,521
Is everything about you?

341
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,108
<i>- Yeah!
- You ruined Belle's concert!</i>

342
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,484
<i>Take responsibility!</i>

343
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,612
<i>- Apologize to Belle!
- You wasted our time!</i>

344
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,031
<i>- Get out of here!
- Leave!</i>

345
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,119
Hey...

346
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,291
Who are you?

347
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,377
Who...

348
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,795
Don't look.

349
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,925
Don't look at me.

350
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,721
Beast!

351
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,975
Unforgivable.
You will not get away with this!

352
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,729
We have to get rid of the Beast
to maintain peace in U.

353
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,939
Is he the leader?

354
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,357
Yeah. That's Justin.

355
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,733
Look.

356
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,499
The light of truth that protects
justice and order in U.

357
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,711
We'll Unveil the horrible Beast!

358
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,298
Look at all those sponsors.

359
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,300
- Unveil?
- Yes, Unveil.

360
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,895
The doors!

361
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,039
You're finished, Beast.
I'm going to reveal your ugly "Origin."

362
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah! Do it!

363
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,560
Get him!

364
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,904
Jerk! You could've hurt Belle!

365
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:22,101
No... This is unacceptable.

366
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,277
I will Unveil him one day!

367
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,659
Who are you?

368
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,546
There. See you later.

369
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,508
Suzu, dinner?

370
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,929
How about seafood?

371
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,473
Okay.

372
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,268
"Belle cancels concert."

373
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,687
I'm so sorry.

374
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,693
That hurts!

375
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:18,616
It's that Dragon guy's fault.
He should get Unveiled already.

376
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,785
Why does he annoy people on purpose?

377
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,453
He thinks he's cool.

378
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,122
There must be a reason.

379
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,331
He's just showing off.

380
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,791
You think so?

381
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,460
We should Unveil him ourselves.

382
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,465
Kamishin, what's with that huge bag?

383
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,468
I have an away match. You too?

384
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,262
I'm not like you.

385
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,144
The AS is constantly in sync
with the user's biometric info.

386
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,063
So you can't have two avatars.

387
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,108
I searched all over the Internet

388
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,611
but there's no data
about his nationality, age, or gender.

389
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,781
Only that he suddenly appeared
seven months ago.

390
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,283
There's no way to find him?

391
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,492
Not the user.

392
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,454
But there are records
of his past opponents.

393
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,414
I see.

394
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,960
In 7 months, he won 369 matches,
lost 3, and tied in 2.

395
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:17,091
Most of his 374 opponents have other
SNS accounts linked with U.

396
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,511
<i>We should talk to them
and see what they know.</i>

397
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,809
We will be using the study room.

398
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,730
Wow.

399
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,235
A question to the Dragon's opponents.

400
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,320
Who is he?

401
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,946
<i>A mystery.</i>

402
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,823
<i>Definitely not AI.</i>

403
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,949
<i>Excessively aggressive.</i>

404
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,326
<i>Bad personality.</i>

405
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,745
<i>- Why does he...
- Take things so far?</i>

406
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,747
<i>I was one of his first opponents.</i>

407
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,832
<i>He didn't have as many bruises.</i>

408
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,959
They're battle scars?

409
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,795
The few of you who beat him.

410
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,923
How did you win?

411
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,883
<i>He suddenly threw the match.</i>

412
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,344
<i>He got distracted.</i>

413
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,222
Angel...

414
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,806
Do you know something?

415
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,479
Any rumors at least?

416
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,356
<i>- No.
- Maybe it's him.</i>

417
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,274
<i>- Him?
- He's got bruises too.</i>

418
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,359
Who?

419
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,409
{\an8}<i>Jellinek, an obscure modern artist.</i>

420
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,622
<i>He started getting tattoos
that looked like bruises</i>

421
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,625
<i>around the time the Dragon showed up.</i>

422
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,836
<i>The value of his artwork
has increased 20 times.</i>

423
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,255
That's suspicious.

424
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,507
Look, his agent's contact info.

425
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,133
Let's call him.

426
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,426
Are you serious?!

427
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,638
<i>I have nothing to say.</i>

428
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,973
Why the tattoos?

429
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,307
<i>Who are you?</i>

430
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,977
What were you doing last night,
and with whom?

431
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,478
<i>Stop bugging me!</i>

432
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,479
Why won't you tell us?

433
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,522
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

434
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,148
JELLINEK: EXIT

435
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,651
He's definitely hiding something.

436
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,615
<i>- Who else could it be?
- Who knows?</i>

437
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,450
<i>I know someone like that.</i>

438
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,119
<i>Someone annoying.</i>

439
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,121
<i>She always says, "You hurt me."</i>

440
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,580
<i>Yeah. Maybe it's her.</i>

441
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,832
A woman?

442
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,001
<i>I was at a birthday party.</i>

443
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,294
Birthday party?

444
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,795
<i>For my husband.</i>

445
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:22,008
<i>A lot of preparing but my daughters
helped me bake the cake.</i>

446
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,468
I'm looking at your Instagram.

447
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,804
<i>- Really?</i>
- You have a lovely family.

448
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:31,767
<i>Are you sure I'm the ideal housewife
for your article?</i>

449
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,479
Absolutely. Please share your happiness
with our readers.

450
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,441
We'll be in touch.

451
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,651
She doesn't seem like a bad person at all.

452
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,905
She was lying through her teeth.
No family. No homemade cake.

453
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:50,036
She's been living off Amazon
and Uber Eats for months.

454
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,414
All her photos are stock photos.

455
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,125
Even this, this and this.

456
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,461
Unbelievable. Why would she do this?

457
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,713
No alibi. Very aggressive.

458
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,425
If her posts
are hinting about those bruises...

459
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,886
she could be the Dragon.

460
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:18,606
{\an8}Fox, an MLB heavy hitter who played
in this year's World Series.

461
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:23,277
Rumor has it that this superstar
has a terrible secret.

462
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,278
Secret?

463
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,616
About him being a violent man
wearing a gentleman's mask.

464
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,579
Apparently, he keeps his top on
to hide all the scars on his body.

465
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:37,458
<i>Every superstar has a skeleton
in his closet</i>

466
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,128
<i>that disillusions us time and time again.</i>

467
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,923
{\an8}<i>Hi. I'm Gogo Doggo.</i>

468
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,299
{\an8}<i>I'm Mr. Reggsignation.</i>

469
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,801
{\an8}<i>- Have you heard?
- About what?</i>

470
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,470
{\an8}<i>There's an AS hugely popular
with children.</i>

471
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,805
{\an8}<i>More popular than me!</i>

472
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,722
{\an8}<i>You're popular?</i>

473
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,724
{\an8}<i>- Weren't you born 1990?
- Who? Who is it?</i>

474
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,310
{\an8}<i>Correct answer is the Dragon.</i>

475
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,062
{\an8}<i>I thought everybody hated him.</i>

476
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,272
{\an8}<i>His hideout is called The Castle.</i>

477
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,067
{\an8}<i>Everybody's looking for it.</i>

478
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,443
{\an8}<i>And what if they find it?</i>

479
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,029
{\an8}<i>- I want a selfie with him.
- And a handshake!</i>

480
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,447
{\an8}<i>I thought he was a bad guy.</i>

481
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,782
{\an8}<i>Villains are cool.</i>

482
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,659
{\an8}<i>He's silent but strong.</i>

483
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,119
{\an8}<i>Aren't you afraid of him?</i>

484
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,123
{\an8}<i>The Dragon is... my hero.</i>

485
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,041
Hero...

486
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,296
<i>It's just me and my boys.</i>

487
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,633
<i>They don't have a mother
but they're happy.</i>

488
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,886
<i>We support each other and enjoy life...</i>

489
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,434
<i>He's an old homie of mine.</i>

490
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,394
<i>We just clicked.</i>

491
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,147
<i>He's actually filthy rich.</i>

492
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,234
<i>Click here if you want to know
where his mansion is.</i>

493
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,445
<i>Who's the Dragon?</i>

494
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,654
<i>Who is he?</i>

495
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,614
<i>What's his real identity?</i>

496
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,991
<i>Who is he?</i>

497
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:57,746
COMMUNITY ACTIVITY CENTER

498
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,708
Mrs. Tsutsui, two lunch specials!

499
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,251
Okay.

500
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,504
<i>It's definitely not a publicity stunt.</i>

501
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,633
<i>I'm still mourning for a loved one
who died in an accident.</i>

502
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,678
<i>I got a tattoo
right where my lover was injured.</i>

503
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,679
Wow!

504
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,849
I guess everybody has a secret.

505
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:21,353
They just disclose a small secret
to protect a bigger one.

506
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,521
You're a cynic.

507
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,484
We have to find out
what he's really trying to hide.

508
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,319
Everybody has a secret.

509
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,487
You too.

510
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,988
- And you.
- Me?

511
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,490
I have no secrets.

512
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,993
Your phone's wallpaper
is a photo of Mr. Terada.

513
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,454
- The physics teacher.
- Shush! Not here!

514
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,498
Here you go.

515
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,794
I'm just a face in the crowd to him.

516
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,839
Don't tell my parents.

517
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,467
They think I'm a good girl.

518
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,593
I won't say anything.

519
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,013
If my mom found out, she'd just die.

520
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,890
Like the other day...

521
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,103
Sorry.

522
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,021
Nevermind.

523
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,356
I am so sorry.

524
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,607
Forget it.

525
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,237
{\an8}I was just thinking how you actually
talk to your parents.

526
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,366
{\an8}After my mom died,
it's been just me and my dad,

527
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,743
but we hardly ever talk.

528
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,333
I know. That's why I'm here for you.

529
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,674
Stop moping and eat!

530
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,009
Two noodle bowls, please!

531
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,302
Coming up.

532
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,616
A castle among these ruins?

533
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,951
<i>I'm right this time.</i>

534
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,953
Why won't you come with me?

535
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,621
<i>Extra lesson with Mr. Terada.</i>

536
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,998
Jeez...

537
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,045
Are you looking for something?

538
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,089
Who are you?

539
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,717
I'm an AI. I know everything.

540
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,635
I'm looking for a castle.

541
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,012
I thought so.

542
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,013
Eh?

543
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,892
Here?

544
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,107
Are you lost?

545
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,734
I'm looking for a castle.

546
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,778
I thought so. I'll tell you, only you.

547
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,875
Are you lost?

548
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,047
You're looking for the castle, right?
Don't tell anyone else.

549
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,757
Wait!

550
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,594
Where am I? I can't see a thing.

551
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,972
They were lying to you.

552
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,768
You'll never find it.

553
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:10,397
Play with me instead.
Follow me down this path.

554
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,369
The castle.

555
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,542
Is anyone here?

556
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,669
Hurry.

557
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,257
- She's here.
- We tried to stop her.

558
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,681
- We're in trouble.
- Master won't like this.

559
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,439
They're beautiful.

560
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,150
I grew them. The secret roses.

561
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,902
Secret?

562
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,030
What secret?

563
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,283
What are you doing here?

564
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,789
You entered without permission.

565
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,166
I followed him...

566
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,793
Leave.

567
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,878
- But...
- Get out of here!

568
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,428
Wait.

569
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,598
I want to ask you something. Who are you?

570
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,017
Hey... wait!

571
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,310
Please answer me.

572
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,813
Leave or I'll bite your head off.

573
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,285
Where are you going?

574
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,672
Wait.

575
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,966
Wait.

576
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,599
Trouble? Are we in trouble?

577
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,309
No. Don't worry.

578
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,061
Everything's okay.

579
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,564
Which one?

580
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,902
Which one is the real you?

581
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,701
Wait!

582
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,370
Stop!

583
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,633
Suzu is in love.

584
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,344
With a bad boy.

585
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,846
No! Why?

586
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,223
It's written on your face.

587
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,684
Teenagers are attracted to bad boys.

588
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,686
Lonely and kind underneath.

589
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,855
I'm the only one who understands him.

590
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,899
I said no!

591
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,777
Why don't you give him a present?

592
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,822
I studied abroad in Ohio
during my senior year in high school.

593
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:10,827
There was a guy with razor-sharp eyes
who was always alone.

594
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,829
A lone wolf?

595
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,123
I was kind of interested in him,

596
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,668
so I gave him a birthday present.

597
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,002
What did you give him?

598
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,170
A song.

599
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,338
- A song?
- A song?

600
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,758
A celebration song.
I wrote it and sang for him.

601
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,344
- That's so sweet.
- A love song!

602
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:31,348
I saw him smile for the first time.
He said he was happy.

603
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,350
- Did you guys go out?
- No.

604
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,393
Why not?

605
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,395
He was still in 8th grade.

606
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,021
- What?
- What?

607
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,983
- Unbelievable.
- An 8th grader?

608
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:45,654
I was touched when he cried
seeing me off at the airport.

609
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,617
I've never written a love song...

610
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,772
<i>You want</i>

611
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:28,905
<i>To be left alone</i>

612
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:36,747
<i>Or that's what you'll say</i>

613
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:42,586
<i>Trying to push me away</i>

614
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:47,883
<i>But the truth is</i>

615
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,930
<i>You don't want me to look</i>

616
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,646
<i>To see</i>

617
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:07,736
<i>What's in your heart</i>

618
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,992
I guess I'll record it.

619
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,623
What?

620
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,043
So many texts.

621
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,047
<i>They were holding hands.</i>

622
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,216
<i>- Her and Shinobu?
- Why?</i>

623
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,219
<i>- They're childhood friends.
- That's no excuse.</i>

624
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,680
<i>She thinks she's better than us.</i>

625
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,681
What's going on?

626
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,102
- <i>Suzu!
</i>- Hiro!

627
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,354
<i>Did you seriously ask Shinobu out?</i>

628
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,730
- No!
- <i>He asked you out?</i>

629
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,773
Of course not!

630
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,691
<i>Then why...</i>

631
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,693
<i>He held my hand...</i>

632
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,860
<i>You held hands?</i>

633
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,862
<i>No! He just grabbed my hand.</i>

634
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:55,033
<i>That's all? But it's blowing up.
Shinobu is something special!</i>

635
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,369
<i>This proves how many girls
are watching him.</i>

636
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,037
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

637
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,707
<i>It's spreading like wildfire.</i>

638
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,546
<i>They're all lashing out. It's like they're
venting their pent-up feelings.</i>

639
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,881
<i>So much tension. Scary.</i>

640
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,884
<i>I thought they were all friends.</i>

641
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,553
<i>I guess you never know.</i>

642
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:18,056
<i>It'll be an all-out war if they continue
to show their true colors.</i>

643
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,599
<i>What should we do?</i>

644
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:24,396
<i>All right. I'll figure out
how to extinguish the fires.</i>

645
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,107
<i>You talk to the reasonable girls.</i>

646
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,150
<i>I'll try.</i>

647
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,068
<i>Listen!</i>

648
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:31,820
<i>Nothing happened!</i>

649
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,948
<i>He'd never date me.</i>

650
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,866
<i>That's true.</i>

651
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,452
<i>- Calm down.
- Chill!</i>

652
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,789
TRUCE

653
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,752
Hello!

654
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,965
We're out of the lion's den.

655
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,426
<i>Sorry...</i>

656
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:59,473
It's a cruel world.
All hell broke loose because it was you.

657
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:03,602
No one would have reacted like this
if it were Luka.

658
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,355
- It's from Luka.
- What?

659
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,692
"Sorry for the sudden text. Can we talk?"

660
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,237
The timing's too perfect.
Why would she text you now?

661
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,864
<i>What do you mean?</i>

662
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,783
<i>Maybe she's behind this.</i>

663
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,701
<i>Definitely not!</i>

664
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,037
<i>She must be after Shinobu.</i>

665
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,831
Why would a pretty girl like her do this?

666
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,584
<i>She kind of gets on my nerves.</i>

667
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,878
<i>She wanted my opinion
as his childhood friend.</i>

668
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,964
<i>I would've ignored her. I'm not that nice.</i>

669
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,429
I can't shake it off...

670
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,027
He's practicing hard.

671
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,112
Yeah, he is.

672
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,201
Shinobu...

673
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,745
He's taking so damn long.

674
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,918
Suzu, did something happen today?

675
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,463
You can tell me.

676
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,638
There's something
I wanted to ask you for a long time.

677
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,306
What is it?

678
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,808
You see...

679
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,395
Well...

680
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,108
- Well...
- Suzu! Heading home?

681
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:36,945
I just finished practicing. I'm wiped out.

682
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,531
What's up?

683
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,451
Kamishin! Oh, right!
How was the away match?

684
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,539
I went and raced. But guess what happened?

685
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:52,711
A coach from my top college pick
was there to watch the match.

686
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,546
I was so pumped.

687
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:58,633
But I was totally off my game.
My results sucked. Oh, by the way.

688
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,719
Look.

689
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:06,391
I felt guilty about the guys
who didn't qualify for the nationals.

690
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,352
You qualified for the nationals?

691
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,772
- Yeah.
- Seriously!

692
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,066
That's awesome! I'm rooting for you!

693
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,110
Rooting for me?

694
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,657
- Shinobu, if she's rooting for me...
- What?

695
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,950
Does it mean...

696
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,204
Suzu has a small crush on me?

697
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,210
What? No, huh?

698
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,879
Go put that way, you idiot.

699
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:40,342
I was just kidding, Suzu.
Thanks for your support.

700
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,136
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

701
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,149
So what were you about to say?

702
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,151
Forget it.

703
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,945
- Holding something back?
- No.

704
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,112
Really?

705
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,948
Really.

706
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:15,669
You don't have to waste your time
worrying about me anymore.

707
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,130
Suzu!

708
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,970
I don't know what to do.

709
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,062
LUKA...

710
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,237
I'M HERE FOR YOU, LUKA.

711
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,739
THANKS, SUZU!

712
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,951
I'M SO SURPRISED! YOU'VE GIVEN ME COURAGE!

713
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,997
A woman?

714
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,015
Bruises.

715
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,729
Don't touch me.

716
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,272
I'm sorry. Those bruises...

717
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,690
You think they're ugly?

718
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,691
No!

719
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,735
Do those bruises hurt?

720
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,528
I'm sure they do. I...

721
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,280
You don't know anything!

722
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,115
Then explain it to me.

723
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,285
Just get out!

724
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,880
- Get out!
- Get out!

725
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,726
Stop.

726
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,730
What were you doing here?

727
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,107
Did you see someone?

728
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,484
An ugly monster, perhaps?

729
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,202
Are you Belle?

730
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,162
Why are you here?

731
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,332
You won't say?

732
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,376
Then...

733
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,840
I'll ask your Origin.

734
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,428
Beast!

735
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,180
- It's him!
- After him!

736
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,530
- He's scared.
- What a wimp.

737
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,670
We'll crash!

738
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,805
Where did he go? Where!

739
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,266
Beast!

740
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,026
Stay away.

741
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,612
Leave me alone.

742
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,965
I think I know you better now.

743
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,721
This is where it really hurts, right?

744
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,434
Thank you for saving me.

745
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,896
Belle...

746
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,399
Master!

747
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,994
<i>You want</i>

748
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:05,959
<i>To be left alone</i>

749
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:12,340
<i>Or that's what you'll say</i>

750
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:17,095
<i>Trying to push me away</i>

751
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:22,684
<i>But the truth is</i>

752
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,147
<i>You don't want me to look</i>

753
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:37,240
<i>To see what's in your heart</i>

754
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:43,663
<i>Anger, fear, sorrow</i>

755
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:49,794
<i>Some nights it can be too much</i>

756
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,547
<i>Yet you</i>

757
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:58,928
<i>Keep it all to yourself</i>

758
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:04,767
<i>Lend me your voice</i>

759
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,022
<i>The voice</i>

760
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:13,151
<i>You try so hard to hide</i>

761
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:18,865
<i>Open the door</i>

762
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:25,622
<i>Open up and let me see the heart</i>

763
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,499
<i>That hides inside</i>

764
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,084
The secret rose.

765
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:59,572
<i>I can</i>

766
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:05,953
<i>Make it on my own</i>

767
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,457
<i>Or that is</i>

768
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,671
<i>What you'll say</i>

769
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:20,093
<i>It's something you told yourself</i>

770
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:26,099
<i>Time and time again</i>

771
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:34,273
<i>Those lonesome nights</i>

772
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:40,405
<i>But I want to see you</i>

773
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:48,079
<i>I want to see the real you</i>

774
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:55,169
<i>That's all that's been on my mind</i>

775
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:05,638
<i>Lend me your voice</i>

776
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:12,729
<i>Show me the face
That you try so hard to hide</i>

777
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:18,860
<i>Open the door</i>

778
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,572
<i>Open up and let me see</i>

779
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:26,659
<i>The heart that hides inside</i>

780
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:32,206
<i>Call out the words</i>

781
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,001
<i>Anything you want to say,</i>

782
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:40,006
<i>I'll be right here, I'll listen to the end</i>

783
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:45,428
<i>Let me inside</i>

784
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:49,348
<i>Let me come</i>

785
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:56,314
<i>And sit right next to your heart</i>

786
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,504
What's happening?

787
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,340
Don't look at me.

788
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:27,929
Who are you?

789
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,486
"Is Belle not doing another concert?
Why won't she sing?"

790
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,782
"She must be afraid.
It's the Beast's fault."

791
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,492
"He should be Unveiled."

792
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,661
Let's leave him alone.

793
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,288
We don't have to know his secret.

794
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:59,085
It's not just us. U isn't just
a small chat room for classmates.

795
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,004
Nobody can stop it.

796
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,424
<i>The Beast threatens order in U.</i>

797
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:10,805
<i>Contact us with any info on the Beast
at #UnveilTheBeast.</i>

798
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,723
<i>He must be an old fart!</i>

799
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,476
<i>He's a young genius gamer!</i>

800
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,354
<i>He's a she, a sexy bombshell.</i>

801
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,314
<i>I heard he's a billionaire.</i>

802
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,609
<i>I'm suing him
for mental distress from our match.</i>

803
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,238
<i>- Is Jellinek, back in the dating game?
- He's amazing.</i>

804
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,031
<i>Wait, I never died!</i>

805
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,199
<i>I guess not.</i>

806
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,577
<i>I never said
it was my girlfriend who died!</i>

807
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:36,247
<i>He's a copycat. He got tattoos to imitate
the Dragon's bruises.</i>

808
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,040
<i>She's lying!</i>

809
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,375
<i>He's a con artist.</i>

810
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,751
<i>Shut up, loser.</i>

811
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:41,836
<i>What!</i>

812
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,297
<i>Plagiarism? Absolutely not!</i>

813
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:49,844
People think I have a secret
because I don't show my skin.

814
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:55,057
The other day, someone in U accused me
of being the Dragon.

815
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,769
But I'm not a villain nor a violent man.

816
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:03,107
I want to be a true hero for the children.

817
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,199
Don't be shocked.

818
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,702
I was very sick when I was little

819
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,288
and had several major surgeries.

820
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:21,042
<i>But I became healthy enough
to play baseball.</i>

821
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:25,212
<i>All you kids watching this,
don't give up on your dream.</i>

822
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:28,424
<i>I hope this message
comes across the right way.</i>

823
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,346
So who's the Dragon?

824
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,805
Unforgivable!

825
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:41,395
Downright unforgivable!
I refuse to forgive anybody who hurts me!

826
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,190
Are you that ideal housewife?

827
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,317
Why a baby?

828
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,362
Because I have an innocent heart.

829
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,363
I don't believe you.

830
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,992
You think a cute baby
can get away with anything.

831
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,121
Shut up! She hurt me!

832
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,000
<i>Is it true Belle will sing again?</i>

833
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,460
<i>It's just a rumor.</i>

834
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,003
<i>I heard she's going to surprise us.</i>

835
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,546
<i>It's not true.</i>

836
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,966
<i>But what if it is?</i>

837
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,188
Where did Belle go?

838
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,815
Belle!

839
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:32,530
Do you know why this light
is the power of justice?

840
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:37,660
Normally, the biometric information
scanned by the device

841
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:41,580
is converted to the AS
through a specialized process.

842
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,501
This light completely invalidates
the conversion.

843
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:49,797
The Origin of the AS
is projected here in U.

844
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,008
This is how "Unveil" works.

845
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,928
It means I have the same power
only the Voices,

846
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,180
U's creators, have.

847
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,810
Have you ever wondered why

848
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:06,605
there are no police on the Internet?

849
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,400
Why is there no law enforcement in U

850
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:12,319
when it's so similar to the real world?

851
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:16,323
It's a good question.
Everybody wants to know why.

852
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,825
But the Voices insist

853
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:21,787
we already have everything we need
for a fair society.

854
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,542
We disagree.
Every society has its villains.

855
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,378
Those who cause trouble and disrupt order.

856
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,673
Those who do as they please
and scoff at the world.

857
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,384
We need the power to fight it.

858
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,845
We need justice no matter where we are.

859
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:41,974
We need the power to crush evil.
And that power is us!

860
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,187
The Beast... The ugly Beast.

861
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:51,108
He must be Unveiled for the future of U.

862
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,401
That said...

863
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,946
Why are you always with him?

864
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:57,948
Why?

865
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,869
Tell me where he is
or face the consequences.

866
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,747
If you don't...

867
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,585
I'll Unveil you right here and now.

868
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,716
- I'd never tell you.
- What?

869
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,468
You don't care about justice.

870
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,720
You just want to control other people.

871
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,722
So I'm not telling you.

872
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:29,730
I won't let you make a fool of me anymore.

873
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,483
You think I can't Unveil you?

874
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,692
Why don't we try?

875
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,404
Let's see the identity
of the world-famous diva.

876
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,866
The real face underneath
the beautiful mask.

877
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,162
I can just imagine it. You're probably...

878
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,790
When the truth is revealed

879
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:52,378
who would pay any attention to your songs?

880
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:58,134
If you don't want that,
tell me who he is! Where is he?

881
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,177
Are you looking for something?

882
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,929
I'll tell you, only you.

883
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,472
What?

884
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,058
Don't tell anyone else.

885
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:09,770
Buzz off!

886
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,030
Damn it!

887
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,763
Thanks for saving me.

888
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,599
I'm glad you're okay.

889
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,938
<i>He's in danger.</i>

890
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,316
<i>I have to help him.</i>

891
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,568
<i>I have to protect him.</i>

892
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,112
Suzu.

893
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,576
What?

894
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,494
If you're in trouble...

895
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,746
I'm not.

896
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,206
You can tell me anything.

897
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,540
There's nothing to tell!

898
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,843
{\an8}HAVE A PEACH FROM MR. MATSUDA.
DAD

899
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,308
Suzu.

900
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,772
Luka.

901
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,778
I couldn't do it.

902
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:45,407
Your text gave me the courage to try.

903
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,495
But I just froze
in front of the guy I like.

904
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,915
Then he said, "What's wrong with you?"

905
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,333
"You're creeping me out."

906
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,085
He did not.

907
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,295
He did. But I don't blame him.

908
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:02,508
I have no confidence,
and I am pretty creepy.

909
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:07,054
No way! Not at all!
Shinobu is such a jerk!

910
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:08,597
What? No.

911
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:09,890
No? Then...

912
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,768
It's Chikami.

913
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:13,978
Chikami?

914
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,563
Shinjiro Chikami.

915
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,065
Kamishin?

916
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,240
You're so cute.

917
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,997
I know who you like.

918
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,249
Don't say it. I'll die of embarrassment.

919
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,418
Since when?

920
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:44,633
When we were six,
he said, "I'll protect you."

921
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,929
I thought it was a marriage proposal.

922
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:53,851
But he meant
he'll protect me from bullies.

923
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,353
He wasn't proposing, of course.

924
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,315
After my mom died,

925
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,776
I was always crying
and it scared my classmates away.

926
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:07,406
He must have thought I was being bullied...

927
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,371
This might sound weird

928
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:19,835
but I always thought
he acted like your mom.

929
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:20,836
My mom?

930
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:23,172
He worries about you for nothing

931
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,091
and asks how you're doing all the time.

932
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:29,053
Shinobu isn't like other guys.

933
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,181
I said his name.

934
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,226
I'm dead.

935
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,983
Take me to the elementary school
you guys went to next time.

936
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,651
I'll come again.

937
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,740
Kamishin.

938
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,867
Oh...

939
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,253
I'm rooting for you.

940
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,296
Rooting for me?

941
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,839
Yes...

942
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:08,050
Rooting for me?

943
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,555
Does that mean

944
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:18,394
you have a small crush on me?

945
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,399
I'm kidding. It was a joke.

946
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,402
What?

947
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,444
Yes.

948
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,154
- What?
- That's right.

949
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,742
What!

950
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,667
Why are you running away?

951
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,877
This is all new to me.

952
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,462
You heard her, didn't you?

953
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,798
- Yeah.
- Aren't you happy?

954
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,007
I am.

955
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,777
Hey!

956
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,779
I don't know what to say.

957
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,615
How about "thank you"
or "I'll do my best"?

958
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,420
Luka...

959
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,754
Yes?

960
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:30,466
What's your hobby?

961
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:33,469
Music. What kind do you like?

962
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:36,805
I like Belle.

963
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:37,931
Me too!

964
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,933
Really? Cool.

965
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:43,020
I've always wished I could sing like her.

966
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:46,899
Don't laugh but people say
I look like her.

967
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,942
You totally do.

968
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,652
She's much prettier...

969
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:55,782
No. You totally look like her.
Are you guys related or what?

970
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:02,748
My family visits my grandfather
in Hakodate every summer.

971
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:07,961
So can I really come
to watch you compete in the nationals?

972
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,216
With you cheering me on

973
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,552
I'll definitely win. Come watch.

974
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:25,062
That was close.
I hope it works out for them.

975
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:26,146
Suzu!

976
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,274
Did you see Kamishin?

977
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,902
Yes. I mean, no...

978
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,654
- Which?
- Yes.

979
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:35,405
- No.
- Which?

980
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,625
Suzu, there's something
I couldn't tell you.

981
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:48,794
Suzu.

982
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:53,507
I'm sorry! Me too. I also have
something to tell you.

983
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,050
Yeah.

984
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:58,178
- You see... I...
- I know.

985
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,305
I'm...

986
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,890
You're Belle, right?

987
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,186
Belle is you, right?

988
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,190
Suzu.

989
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,359
You're wrong!

990
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:13,527
Suzu!

991
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,653
No!

992
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,661
Suzu, where did you go? Suzu!

993
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,543
What do I do now?

994
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:34,840
How will I tell him...

995
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,597
<i>Suzu, the Dragon is in trouble!</i>

996
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:51,857
His castle...

997
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,109
- They finally...
- Found it.

998
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:04,202
We will show no mercy!
The Beast's Origin will be revealed!

999
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:11,835
We will make him pay for his sins
in front of everyone in U!

1000
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,217
<i>The Beast's Origin
will finally be Unveiled.</i>

1001
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,552
<i>Who is he?</i>

1002
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,720
<i>Everyone wants to know.</i>

1003
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:24,181
<i>I heard he's a psycho killer.</i>

1004
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:26,975
<i>A crooked businessman who evades taxes.</i>

1005
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,394
<i>- Get lost, Beast.
- Get lost, Beast.</i>

1006
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,563
<i>The Beast is totally worthless.</i>

1007
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,649
<i>He might as well disappear.</i>

1008
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:36,443
{\an8}<i>- Dragon, you watching this?
- I doubt it.</i>

1009
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:40,155
{\an8}<i>Kids around the world
are cheering for you.</i>

1010
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,366
{\an8}<i>- You watching, Dragon?
- He's not.</i>

1011
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,409
{\an8}<i>The Dragon is bullied by adults!</i>

1012
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,869
{\an8}<i>Poor Dragon.</i>

1013
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,412
{\an8}<i>Someone, help him.</i>

1014
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,623
{\an8}<i>Let's all cheer him on!</i>

1015
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,333
{\an8}<i>There's still time.</i>

1016
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,960
{\an8}<i>Cheer the Dragon on.</i>

1017
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:59,216
{\an8}<i>These idiots only have one-digit views!</i>

1018
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,134
{\an8}<i>- They have no influence.
- Get lost, Dragon.</i>

1019
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,969
{\an8}<i>- They try too hard.
- Idiot Dragon.</i>

1020
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,597
<i>- Come to the old school!</i>
- Okay!

1021
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,662
What happened?

1022
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,291
Protect our master...

1023
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,759
They refused to take us to the Beast.

1024
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,053
How could you do this?

1025
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,972
They're just AI.

1026
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:49,891
He's not here.

1027
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,228
Fine. Let's go.
We'll set this castle on fire.

1028
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:58,942
He'll come scurrying out like a sewer rat.

1029
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,238
Look behind you...

1030
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:07,409
I'll tell you, only you...

1031
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:34,603
It's dangerous here but don't worry.
We'll leave together.

1032
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:39,566
If I can endure it,
everything will be okay.

1033
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,734
What?

1034
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:45,906
Belle, I'm sorry
I can't tell you the truth.

1035
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:47,157
Wait!

1036
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,533
Don't go!

1037
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,193
Shinobu, check this out.

1038
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,822
Things are going crazy in U.

1039
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,408
- Suzu...
- Suzu?

1040
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,244
Do you know where she went?

1041
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:33,286
No.

1042
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:37,666
We were just talking about
your old elementary school.

1043
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:40,043
Is it close by?

1044
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:46,216
Shinobu? What? Luka?

1045
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:51,680
- You're late!
- Sorry!

1046
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,641
I'm auto-searching anything
that might be related.

1047
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,103
We have to find his Origin
before Justin gets to him.

1048
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,229
But how?

1049
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:03,233
How can we pinpoint one person
out of five billion?

1050
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:06,570
Where is he? Where did he go?

1051
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:08,655
Where?

1052
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,283
Where is he?

1053
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,034
- It's Belle!
- Belle?

1054
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,911
- For real?
- I knew she'd come.

1055
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,705
How rare is this!

1056
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,001
Stop it! I have to find him!

1057
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,295
Let me go! Please!

1058
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,464
Belle is going to sing again!

1059
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,300
The rumor was true!

1060
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,676
We were waiting for you!

1061
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,094
I want to hear Belle's voice!

1062
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:32,137
Sing for us!

1063
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:36,766
Hey! There's no time! Let Belle go!

1064
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,143
She's surrounded.

1065
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,311
This is bad.

1066
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,229
But if we go now...

1067
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,981
She'll find out that we know.

1068
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,482
But...

1069
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,359
{\an8}<i>we should go.</i>

1070
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:47,485
{\an8}<i>- Right.
- Right.</i>

1071
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,864
Please let Belle go!

1072
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:56,161
{\an8}<i>Think again carefully.
Who is he underneath the surface?</i>

1073
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:57,871
<i>You hurt me!</i>

1074
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:02,292
<i>Is he lonely like that woman?</i>

1075
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,003
<i>Then...</i>

1076
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:09,674
<i>I got a tattoo
right where my lover was injured.</i>

1077
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,678
<i>His bruises aren't like tattoos...</i>

1078
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,267
<i>I had several major surgeries.</i>

1079
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,354
<i>But they aren't like real scars either.</i>

1080
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:27,150
<i>If the device scanned traces
of physical pain,</i>

1081
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,319
<i>his real body might also be bruised.</i>

1082
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:31,237
<i>But...</i>

1083
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:36,117
<i>Why were his bruises trembling?</i>

1084
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:42,040
<i>And those child-like eyes
that he showed me...</i>

1085
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,210
<i>Child?</i>

1086
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:50,382
A kid's voice!

1087
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:53,927
Only he and I know this song.

1088
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,888
Where is it coming from?

1089
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,056
Suzu...

1090
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,475
Where? Where are you!

1091
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:19,953
{\an8}<i>I've seen him somewhere...</i>

1092
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:25,834
{\an8}<i>The Dragon is... my hero.</i>

1093
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:28,586
<i>It's just me and my boys.</i>

1094
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,090
<i>They don't have a mother
but they're happy.</i>

1095
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,383
{\an8}We get along great...

1096
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,636
{\an8}<i>Why does he know this song?</i>

1097
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,846
I'll zoom in.

1098
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:55,196
It's Belle.

1099
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,494
{\an8}So, is he the Dragon?

1100
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,079
{\an8}But something's off.

1101
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:04,581
What do you mean?

1102
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:07,250
I don't think it's him.

1103
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:09,419
He doesn't seem to have any bruises.

1104
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:17,427
{\an8}<i>Tomo, what's that song?</i>

1105
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:22,599
{\an8}<i>I'm working.
Don't you realize how distracting it is?</i>

1106
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,320
<i>Why do you disobey me?</i>

1107
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:40,158
<i>The world has rules
and I make the rules in this house.</i>

1108
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:45,121
<i>If you can't follow them,
you're no good to me.</i>

1109
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,582
<i>Do I have to repeat myself?</i>

1110
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,044
<i>Do I have to do this?</i>

1111
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:52,962
<i>Don't!</i>

1112
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,173
{\an8}<i>It's not Tomo's fault.</i>

1113
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,925
<i>- Move!
- Stop it!</i>

1114
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:58,927
<i>Get out of my way!</i>

1115
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:01,346
<i>Tomo, don't listen.</i>

1116
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,099
<i>Who do you think feeds you?</i>

1117
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,519
<i>It's my fault, okay? Not yours.</i>

1118
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:11,439
<i>Kei, you're 14.
Why don't you understand already?</i>

1119
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,359
<i>It's my fault.</i>

1120
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,238
<i>What good are you?</i>

1121
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:20,281
<i>Everything's my fault.</i>

1122
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:25,662
<i>You should disappear. Go! Disappear!</i>

1123
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:28,081
<i>You're worthless so disappear!</i>

1124
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:36,297
If I can endure it...

1125
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:44,722
I found him. This boy...

1126
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,392
is him.

1127
01:25:56,693 --> 01:26:03,700
{\an8}LET'S CHEER FOR DRAGON

1128
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,788
A poor excuse for a father...

1129
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,585
{\an8}<i>Kei, are you okay? Kei...</i>

1130
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,504
I see. I think I understand.

1131
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,425
{\an8}Kei wanted to be a hero to encourage Tomo.

1132
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,719
I know why

1133
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,388
- the Dragon is so strong.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1134
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:29,684
Since U's body-sharing technology
reveals the hidden "you"

1135
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:34,105
all this pain
must be the source of his strength.

1136
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:37,233
Like how Suzu became Belle...

1137
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,032
ACCEPT

1138
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,709
<i>Connected.</i>

1139
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:58,963
Can you see me?

1140
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,717
Can you hear my voice?

1141
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,179
I saw what happened.

1142
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:09,224
{\an8}Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay.

1143
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:13,102
{\an8}I want to go see you.

1144
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:15,271
{\an8}Tell me where you are. I'll...

1145
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,607
{\an8}<i>Who are you?</i>

1146
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,360
The first time in real life!

1147
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:24,822
{\an8}I'm... Belle.

1148
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,950
{\an8}<i>- Belle?
- Yeah, right.</i>

1149
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:28,910
{\an8}<i>Connected.</i>

1150
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:30,578
{\an8}<i>See? I told you.</i>

1151
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,623
{\an8}<i>- Child abuse.
- Call the cops!</i>

1152
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,375
{\an8}<i>Should we?</i>

1153
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,716
{\an8}<i>Do you also laugh
at other people's secrets?</i>

1154
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,717
{\an8}No.

1155
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:48,304
{\an8}<i>Did you enjoy seeing how miserable we are?</i>

1156
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:52,433
{\an8}No! I want to help you.

1157
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:57,063
{\an8}That's why I called. I want to help you.

1158
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:58,481
{\an8}Help? How?

1159
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:04,779
{\an8}<i>Help. I've heard it so many times.</i>

1160
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:08,658
{\an8}<i>"I'll talk to your father."
"I talked to your father."</i>

1161
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:11,202
<i>"Your father understands now."</i>

1162
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,204
<i>But nothing changed.</i>

1163
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,872
<i>I'll help you?</i>

1164
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,501
<i>What can you do?</i>

1165
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:23,381
<i>Help. You don't know anything.</i>

1166
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:27,510
<i>Help. Talk is easy.</i>

1167
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:32,557
<i>Help. "I want to change things for you."</i>

1168
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,352
<i>Help! Tears of pity and sympathy.</i>

1169
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,146
<i>It doesn't change anything.</i>

1170
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:44,235
<i>Help!</i>

1171
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,486
<i>I'm sick of it!</i>

1172
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:47,488
<i>Go away!</i>

1173
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,577
Kei! Come back!

1174
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,037
It's disconnected.

1175
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,705
Where are you?

1176
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:57,623
He doesn't trust you!

1177
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,586
He'll never tell you where he is.

1178
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:05,048
What now?

1179
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,149
Sing as Suzu.

1180
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,943
Make room for Belle!

1181
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:41,459
Now watch. Her song will draw him out.

1182
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:45,213
He'll come like he did before.

1183
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:46,672
I know he will.

1184
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,434
Not as Belle.

1185
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,813
Call out to him as Suzu.

1186
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,148
Are you crazy!

1187
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,485
I think that's the only way
to contact him again.

1188
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,446
Do you even know what you're saying?

1189
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:14,408
Everything Suzu worked for
will go up in smoke!

1190
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:17,787
It's the only way to gain his trust.

1191
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:21,249
Suzu! What have you been doing
all of this for?

1192
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:26,504
Want to go back to the old you?
Do you want to be a crybaby again?

1193
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:28,047
Is that what you want?

1194
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:38,182
Their identities
are revealed more or less.

1195
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,644
What can you do for them wearing a mask?

1196
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:45,857
How can you get through to them
if you're not yourself?

1197
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:59,120
Hey! Why doesn't she sing?

1198
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:16,971
Sing!

1199
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:19,849
Sing and draw out the ugly Beast!

1200
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:21,225
Sing!

1201
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:24,979
What?

1202
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:26,898
- Shine the light!
- What?

1203
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,108
Shine the light on me!

1204
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,572
What's going on?

1205
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:38,201
You're kidding? You want to be Unveiled?

1206
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,073
What's that?

1207
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:25,456
Belle's Origin...

1208
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:29,585
She looks so different.

1209
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,212
Except the freckles.

1210
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:33,089
Belle's been Unveiled!

1211
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:34,882
Who Unveiled her?

1212
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,634
She did!

1213
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:39,011
Oh, no!

1214
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,555
Why was she Unveiled?

1215
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,100
Weren't you listening? She did it herself.

1216
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:45,559
- She did?
- Why?

1217
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:46,769
For what?

1218
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:50,982
Belle is just an ordinary girl...

1219
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,238
Like me.

1220
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,574
This was our secret!

1221
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,246
Is this the music app?

1222
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,207
- Don't!
- Suzu!

1223
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:19,677
Suzu, sing!

1224
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,014
She can't sing as herself!

1225
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,473
She can.

1226
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:25,975
She can't!

1227
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:27,768
- Suzu...
- Suzu...

1228
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,104
- Will she sing?
- Suzu...

1229
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:45,703
<i>The flowers that sparkle</i>

1230
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:50,541
<i>The gems of our dreams</i>

1231
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,421
<i>This world</i>

1232
01:33:56,505 --> 01:34:01,802
<i>Is beautiful</i>

1233
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:13,230
<i>Though fear and uncertainty</i>

1234
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:19,236
<i>Tie chains around my heart</i>

1235
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:24,075
<i>I want to grow</i>

1236
01:34:24,867 --> 01:34:30,247
<i>Kind and strong</i>

1237
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:38,798
<i>That sky</i>

1238
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:40,549
She's trembling.

1239
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,718
The poor girl was Unveiled.

1240
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:47,515
<i>Will never return</i>

1241
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:48,724
Belle!

1242
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:54,939
<i>Without someone to love</i>

1243
01:34:56,732 --> 01:35:03,739
<i>What is there to live for?</i>

1244
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:11,622
<i>Come back to me and stay by my side</i>

1245
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:18,712
<i>I feel my heart shake, come ease the ache</i>

1246
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:26,220
<i>I'm standing over here, reaching for you</i>

1247
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:32,810
<i>A million miles away, come back and stay</i>

1248
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:40,234
<i>It still makes no sense
What's our destiny?</i>

1249
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:47,032
<i>When I close my eyes
You're all that I see</i>

1250
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:52,746
<i>Come back to me</i>

1251
01:35:54,165 --> 01:36:01,172
<i>A million miles away, come back and stay</i>

1252
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:00,981
Mom, don't go!

1253
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,109
I have to or she'll die.

1254
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:13,447
- Suzu!
- Suzu!

1255
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,907
Suzu!

1256
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:20,162
Belle! Sing! Don't stop!

1257
01:39:20,245 --> 01:39:21,330
It's Peggie Sue.

1258
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:22,456
The Peggie Sue?

1259
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:27,461
Belle, sing!

1260
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,961
Why won't she fade away
after being Unveiled?

1261
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,633
Damn it.

1262
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:18,595
What's that?

1263
01:40:57,634 --> 01:41:03,640
<i>Sing, let your heart soar!
It brings us together!</i>

1264
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:09,646
<i>So sad and so happy!
The feelings flow over, now</i>

1265
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:15,486
<i>Our world is full of all kinds of colors</i>

1266
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:21,575
<i>Closing my eyes I still can see the stars</i>

1267
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:27,456
<i>Shine in the sky and soon the rising sun</i>

1268
01:41:27,539 --> 01:41:33,587
<i>Flowers, they're blooming
Oh, it's beautiful</i>

1269
01:41:35,088 --> 01:41:36,089
Sing!

1270
01:41:37,674 --> 01:41:40,010
Sing!

1271
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:46,225
<i>Sing my song, never-ending</i>

1272
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:50,270
<i>Sing it through, I love you</i>

1273
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:58,487
<i>Always, forever</i>

1274
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:26,682
Wow...

1275
01:42:27,349 --> 01:42:31,728
Kei, I want to see Belle.

1276
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:34,189
Is she really Belle?

1277
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:38,819
I don't completely trust her yet. But...

1278
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:53,083
<i>Belle? Can you see us?</i>

1279
01:42:54,626 --> 01:42:55,669
<i>Belle?</i>

1280
01:42:56,628 --> 01:42:57,671
<i>Belle?</i>

1281
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:02,050
- Yes!
- Yes!

1282
01:43:03,176 --> 01:43:04,052
Suzu.

1283
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:08,015
Your feelings reached them.

1284
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,517
Shinobu.

1285
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:13,437
I'm so glad!

1286
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:15,939
So glad...

1287
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:27,075
<i>Why do you disobey me?</i>

1288
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,995
The hell is this?

1289
01:43:30,954 --> 01:43:33,123
{\an8}<i>Our address is...</i>

1290
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:37,419
{\an8}<i>That, huh?</i>

1291
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:38,837
{\an8}<i>No... Stop.</i>

1292
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:40,172
<i>Move!</i>

1293
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,925
{\an8}<i>- You're in my way!
- Kei!</i>

1294
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:46,970
{\an8}<i>Screw you!</i>

1295
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:54,144
- They're in trouble.
- We have to protect them.

1296
01:43:54,227 --> 01:43:55,562
But where are they?

1297
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:57,356
We didn't get their address.

1298
01:43:57,981 --> 01:44:00,817
I think there's a clue.

1299
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:05,364
I heard the evening melody
from the monitor.

1300
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:06,490
Melody?

1301
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:10,661
One was "The Sunset Glow"
and the other, "The Coconut."

1302
01:44:11,244 --> 01:44:13,705
The daily public announcement music.

1303
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:14,706
Two of them?

1304
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:16,917
They must be between two cities.

1305
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,919
- Which ones?
- Let me check.

1306
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:20,879
I have the recorded clip!

1307
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:35,602
- She's right.
- Good ears.

1308
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:39,064
What's that? Zoom in on the window.

1309
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:42,776
- What are they?
- Buildings? Apartments?

1310
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,487
- Two of them?
- Find out where!

1311
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:46,989
We need more info.

1312
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:47,990
Wait.

1313
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:53,370
Luka, I think I know where this is.

1314
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:57,249
Hold on. Where was it?

1315
01:44:57,332 --> 01:44:58,625
Hurry up!

1316
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,544
- Got it.
- Where is it?

1317
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:03,130
<i>Two tall buildings around Tokyo</i>

1318
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:06,008
<i>between Ota Ward and Kawasaki City.</i>

1319
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:07,968
Is this it?

1320
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:12,723
It's a match!

1321
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:13,849
- Good job.
- Yes!

1322
01:45:13,932 --> 01:45:15,058
- Yes!
- Yes!

1323
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:19,146
I'm calling about children
who need immediate protection

1324
01:45:19,229 --> 01:45:22,024
in a neighborhood I'm about to describe.

1325
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:24,693
Why not?

1326
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:26,486
Rules?

1327
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:32,242
But what if something happens in 48 hours?

1328
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:33,160
I have to go.

1329
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:34,911
Suzu!

1330
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,372
- I'll drive you to the station.
- Suzu!

1331
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:47,841
No more flights.

1332
01:45:47,924 --> 01:45:50,093
Should we drive her to Tokyo?

1333
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:58,226
Is she okay by herself?

1334
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:00,395
It was her decision.

1335
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:11,073
<i>Dad, I left without saying anything
but I'm on my way to somewhere far away.</i>

1336
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,662
<i>I got a message from the choir ladies.</i>

1337
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,624
<i>Sorry I'm always so selfish.</i>

1338
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:22,209
<i>You must have your reasons.</i>

1339
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:25,504
<i>Someone important to me is in trouble.</i>

1340
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:30,175
<i>You're trying to help that person.</i>

1341
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:35,555
<i>But I don't know what I can do.</i>

1342
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:40,352
<i>You've been...</i>

1343
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:45,941
<i>so sad since your mom died.</i>

1344
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:49,111
<i>You suffered so much.</i>

1345
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:52,614
<i>It's been tough for you.</i>

1346
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:58,537
<i>But you've grown to be such a caring girl.</i>

1347
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,290
<i>You understand how people feel.</i>

1348
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:08,713
<i>Suzu, you've...</i>

1349
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:15,720
<i>became the kind girl that you are
because your mom raised you.</i>

1350
01:47:19,432 --> 01:47:23,562
<i>Now be kind to that person.</i>

1351
01:47:26,648 --> 01:47:29,526
THANK YOU

1352
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,453
- This is it.
- Belle?

1353
01:48:24,456 --> 01:48:26,291
You came?

1354
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:27,542
Tomo!

1355
01:48:28,668 --> 01:48:29,711
Belle!

1356
01:48:36,968 --> 01:48:40,388
It's okay. Everything's going to be okay.

1357
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,434
Are you really Belle?

1358
01:48:55,987 --> 01:48:58,156
Where are you?

1359
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,325
Kei! Tomo!

1360
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:04,746
You left without my permission.

1361
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:08,667
Who are you?

1362
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:12,045
Did you make that post on the Internet?

1363
01:49:12,128 --> 01:49:13,046
How dare you!

1364
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:24,349
Kei! Tomo! Go back inside!
Why won't you listen to me?

1365
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:28,395
I'm your father! You'll do as I say!

1366
01:49:28,478 --> 01:49:31,273
Damn you little brat!

1367
01:49:31,356 --> 01:49:33,733
Trying to tear apart our family?

1368
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:37,362
I won't let you!

1369
01:49:39,572 --> 01:49:40,699
Unforgivable!

1370
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:44,429
Belle.

1371
01:50:48,266 --> 01:50:50,602
I knew when you hugged me.

1372
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:53,897
You really are Belle.

1373
01:50:55,523 --> 01:50:57,359
Thank you for coming.

1374
01:50:58,151 --> 01:51:01,905
I really wanted you to come.

1375
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:06,159
I wanted to meet you, Belle.

1376
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:09,204
Me too.

1377
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:24,803
I watched you take a stand
and realized I had to do it too.

1378
01:51:24,886 --> 01:51:26,971
So I'm going to fight.

1379
01:51:29,307 --> 01:51:31,810
I learned from you too.

1380
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:36,272
You freed my heart from fear.

1381
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:38,483
Thanks.

1382
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:43,405
I love you, Belle.

1383
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:45,990
Thank you.

1384
01:51:46,491 --> 01:51:49,411
Belle, you're amazing.

1385
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:52,080
You're beautiful.

1386
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:11,850
<i>U is another reality. AS is another you.</i>

1387
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:14,894
<i>You can live as another you.</i>

1388
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:18,356
<i>You can start a new life.</i>

1389
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:21,443
<i>You can change the world.</i>

1390
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:46,593
Do you want dinner tonight?

1391
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:50,346
Yeah.

1392
01:52:52,765 --> 01:52:54,267
Let's have seafood.

1393
01:52:56,769 --> 01:52:57,729
I'm back.

1394
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:00,690
Welcome home.

1395
01:53:01,733 --> 01:53:02,901
Suzu!

1396
01:53:03,776 --> 01:53:05,695
Welcome back!

1397
01:53:17,081 --> 01:53:18,249
Suzu.

1398
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:23,296
The way you protected those kids...
That was really something.

1399
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,757
You were so cool.

1400
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:33,890
I'm finally free!

1401
01:53:34,516 --> 01:53:38,520
I'm done being your guardian.
We can just be normal friends.

1402
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:41,022
It's what I always wanted.

1403
01:53:54,869 --> 01:53:55,995
Thank you.

1404
01:54:13,054 --> 01:54:15,348
Let's sing and walk.

1405
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:17,725
Great idea. It'll be good practice.

1406
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:19,394
For the concert.

1407
01:54:19,477 --> 01:54:20,562
What should we sing?

1408
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:22,146
What else?

1409
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:23,731
That song, right?

1410
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:25,525
Suzu!

1411
01:54:25,608 --> 01:54:26,526
What?

1412
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:28,278
Take the lead.

1413
01:54:28,361 --> 01:54:29,821
- Sing!
- Sing!

1414
01:54:32,907 --> 01:54:33,950
I'll listen.

1415
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:40,915
Ready?
