1
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,066
In accordance with the regulations
of the state of Mississippi...

2
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,028
...we gather today to lay to rest...

3
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:37,282
...the remains of inmates
R. Gibson, number 4316...

4
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,660
...and C. Banks, number 4317.

5
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,498
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

6
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,336
May God have mercy on their souls.

7
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,713
-Amen.
-Amen.

8
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,716
You can go ahead, fellas.

9
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,101
Look like you finally free now, boys.

10
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,439
Finally free.

11
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,900
Friends of yours, old-timer?

12
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,944
Let's just say
we spent some time together.

13
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,949
Now, why do I get the feeling when you
say "some time," you mean some time.

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,994
I'd been here a good while
when they come.

15
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,039
They come here, must've been 1932.

16
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,958
-Man!
-Shit, that's like.... Wait a minute.

17
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,169
That's 65 years, son.

18
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,462
Shit.

19
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,131
Didn't they burn in that fire yesterday?

20
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,635
Listen, man, I seen them niggers
before they put them in the box.

21
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,429
And when I tell you, them niggers,
they was bacon burnt.

22
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,723
It was like from the X Files, man.

23
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,812
What you got in that bottle anyway?

24
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,481
This is Rayford's special recipe.

25
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:58,113
He had what we call exacting standards
when it comes to the hootch.

26
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,533
-So, what were they, bootleggers?
-Something like that.

27
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,088
-Hank, my man, how you doin'?
-No, not tonight, Ray.

28
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,091
-Spanky's not happy with you.
-Is Spanky here?

29
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,302
Find a place where they let you
in the front door.

30
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,263
Wait.

31
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,724
Remember I bought your girl
the alligator shoes?

32
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,642
What's wrong? I came through for you!

33
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,521
She was wearin' pigskin when I met her.
She's in alligator now. Let me in.

34
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,857
Yeah, that's how it goes, brother.

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,317
Thank you, man. I appreciate it.

36
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,987
-How does this tie look?
-Lookin' sharp, man.

37
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,947
I feel lucky tonight, too.

38
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,839
-Here's to your new job down at the bank.
-Thank you.

39
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,675
I always knew you'd make something
of yourself.

40
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,597
-With my first paycheck, I'll buy....
-What, baby?

41
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,435
Season tickets to the Yankees,
right on the first base line.

42
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,103
What's wrong?

43
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,190
I was hoping you were gonna say
an engagement ring, Claude.

44
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,568
-Engagement ring?
-That's what respectable folks do.

45
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,572
Get a job, get married, start having babies.

46
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,825
Isn't that what you want?

47
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,995
I just don't see no reason
to rush into things.

48
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,624
I got to clean this. I'll be right back, baby.

49
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,308
-Good evening, sir.
-Can I have a towel, please?

50
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,477
-Of course.
-Look at this.

51
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,773
Hey, there ain't no reason to get violent.
I tried to call.

52
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,067
Sit your ass down.

53
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,780
Congratulations.
You finally got yourself a job.

54
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,075
Now you can pay Mr. Riley
that 50 bucks you owe him.

55
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,286
-I got a bill to pay out there.
-Lookie here.

56
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,916
-$22.
-Not bad...for a start.

57
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,962
That's two weeks' pay. I'm with my girl.
You gotta leave me something.

58
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,341
-How about your legs?
-My legs? Those are good.

59
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,802
That's good.

60
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,388
I'll keep the legs.

61
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,726
Excuse me.

62
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,520
How'd he get in here?

63
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
Evenin'.

64
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,745
-You got any of that French shit?
-Yeah, bro.

65
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,081
That's the one there.

66
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,959
-Thanks, man.
-All right.

67
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,795
-Do I smell French?
-That's it.

68
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,798
-Here, you keep the change.
-Thank you.

69
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,518
-Hey, don't I know you?
-I don't think so.

70
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,689
-Yes, I know you. What is your name?
-Claude Banks.

71
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,942
Claude Banks! Hey, it's me, Ray Gibson.

72
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,154
We went to high school. How you doin'?

73
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,949
-You went to Monroe?
-Yes! How you doing?

74
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,079
You lookin' all sharp.
Good to see colored folks doin' good.

75
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,081
I went to Jefferson.

76
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,416
You must have another Claude Banks
in mind.

77
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,211
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry. My mistake.

78
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
Are you wearin' that dress?

79
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,852
Hey, what's goin' on?

80
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,397
Is it about my tab?
Don't worry, it's covered.

81
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,565
It's hot in here tonight. Hot.

82
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,945
This ain't about your tab.
You got bigger problems than that.

83
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,947
Hold up one second....

84
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,075
You shouldn't have run numbers
on Spanky's side of Broadway.

85
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,453
-I think we gotta get out of here.
-Excuse me, sir, your bill.

86
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,998
The bill? Of course, the bill.

87
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,794
How can I forget the bill?
Such an incredibly large bill.

88
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,177
Just tell me where you want me to go.

89
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,429
Get over here.

90
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,683
-You took my ankle.
-All right, that's not nice.

91
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,685
Yeah, right?

92
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,771
What do you think they're gonna do to us?

93
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,899
What'd you do, dine and ditch?

94
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,735
-Over ten bucks?
-Yeah.

95
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,112
-Probably just a thumb.
-Who is he?

96
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,990
Friend of yours?

97
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,034
I never met this man before tonight.

98
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,579
He's a lowlife that hangs around
in bathrooms pickpocketing people.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,582
I'm a professional man.

100
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,168
I got a job that starts on Monday.

101
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,796
I'll pay you back with my first paycheck,
with interest.

102
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,132
I won't tell you how to run your business...

103
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,302
...but if you cut off my fingers,
you won't get nothing.

104
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,847
Working on adding machines,
I got to be whole.

105
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,350
I need these for prayin'!

106
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,103
-Drop him.
-What does "drop him" mean?

107
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,065
This ain't the way you treat somebody.

108
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,859
Spanky, you ain't got to do that
to that guy.

109
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,653
He's a square.
He didn't know who he was fucking with.

110
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,531
It's filthy down there.

111
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,034
Damn, there's a rat. I hate rats.

112
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,454
But you do.
What does that say about you?

113
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,374
What does that say about me?

114
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,294
I'm just tryin' to get by.
You remember when you started out?

115
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,671
Nigger, please.

116
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,425
Wait a second.

117
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,304
I want you to see this. Check this out.

118
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:00,517
-I got access to that.
-Is that some more of your bathtub brew?

119
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,269
Hell, no, this come up from the Mississippi.

120
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,897
I can get more. I want to go into business.

121
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,067
Under present circumstances,
I think I may want a partner, OK?

122
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,986
I was supposed to wear this suit
on Monday!

123
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,199
If you give me the front money
and a truck...

124
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,121
...l can get there in two or three days,
if somebody helps me with the driving.

125
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,169
-Come on, now!
-Come on, Spank.

126
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,219
I'm gonna tell you something.

127
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,057
-You fuck me on this, I'll spare no expense.
-I understand.

128
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,226
-Do you hear me?
-I hear you.

129
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,603
-You got a deal.
-All right.

130
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,856
Pick a man and get outta here.

131
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,442
With all due respect to you gentlemen...

132
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,819
...l think I'm gonna just take the choirboy.

133
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,654
You got to be crazy.

134
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,616
At least pick somebody
who can watch your back.

135
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,911
I want someone who won't shoot me
once the truck's full.

136
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,789
-Lift him.
-Not that you'd do that.

137
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,584
-Lift him!
-You know what I mean.

138
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,962
There you go.

139
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,465
Sure he ain't dead?

140
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,598
Sure hope you can drive.

141
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,690
This rum run we're doin' is gonna really
improve my relationship with Spanky.

142
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,903
Good man to have on your side.
He's got capital connections.

143
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,531
I ain't got capital yet, but I will.

144
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,408
Then I'll have my own place.

145
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,370
Don't get me wrong, I like Spanky's.
I want my own.

146
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,413
I'm gonna call my place...

147
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,707
...Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

148
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,503
Don't that sound like a place
where it's fun? Sound excitin'.

149
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,255
Ray's Boom-Boom Room. I like that.

150
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,176
Wouldn't you want to check out
a place like that?

151
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,887
Hell, you'd want to.

152
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,349
The Boom-Boom Room.

153
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,310
What you think?

154
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,940
You ain't said nothin' since we left.

155
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,943
The least you can do is give me
friendly conversation.

156
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,947
I don't want a friendly conversation.
I don't want to be your friend.

157
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,702
I just want to do this thing and get back
to New York in time to start my job.

158
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,912
What the hell kind of job you got?

159
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:30,500
If you must know,
bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan.

160
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,754
What's so funny?

161
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm just laughing at myself. Excuse me.

162
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,802
No, you found something very amusing.
What's so funny?

163
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,931
"Bank teller" just sounds like ladies' work,
I always picture a woman doing that.

164
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,309
Maybe I should dig around
in other people's pockets for money.

165
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,729
It's obviously been highly successful
for you.

166
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,189
You'd be surprised what you find there.

167
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,359
I've never heard of a man
settin' out to be a bank teller.

168
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,862
This time next year, I'll be a loan officer.

169
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,489
So, I go to the bank for a loan...

170
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,575
...l gotta deal with a tight-ass like you?

171
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,161
-That's right.
-Well, how do I get a loan?

172
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,455
-You?
-Yes, me. What's "you"?

173
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,623
I can't get no money?

174
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,502
-You need collateral.
-What, you think I ain't got collateral?

175
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,923
I have.... Look at this. What about this?

176
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,677
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?

177
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,305
I ain't steal that. My daddy gave it to me.

178
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,640
Who'd he steal it from?

179
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,353
Watch what you say about my daddy.
My daddy's dead.

180
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,147
Say what you want about me.
Don't drag my daddy into it.

181
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,609
This watch is sterling silver.
It's top-shelf, top of the line.

182
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,030
It's very near and dear to my heart,
so no wisecracks or I'll whup your ass.

183
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,700
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied.

184
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,621
Fuck you. I'll take my business elsewhere.

185
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,416
And for future references, you will not
be welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

186
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,544
-There's no Boom-Boom Room.
-When there is one.

187
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,465
When there's one, don't come,
'cause you ain't gettin' in.

188
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,445
-Smell that?
-Yeah, I smell something.

189
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,574
-Smells good, right?
-I think we should go to another place.

190
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,536
The ambiance ain't really very welcoming.

191
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,873
Are you kiddin'? Tell me you don't want
one of these pies right here.

192
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,459
Them pies look good,
but I kinda lost my appetite.

193
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,879
-When I came in, my appetite left.
-Good afternoon, Billy.

194
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,925
We'd like some coffee
and a couple slices of pie.

195
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,302
How do you know my name is Billy?

196
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,515
It says it right there on your shirt.

197
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,937
If you boys can read so good, how come
you missed that sign on the door?

198
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,275
That sign on the door....

199
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,278
Why didn't we see that sign
that say "No Coloreds Allowed"?

200
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,905
We rushed in.
We was really hungry, so we missed it.

201
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,033
-We see it now, so bye.
-Look, ma'am...

202
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,368
-...we've been traveling all day.
-Let's go.

203
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:14,080
All we want is some coffee
and a couple slices of pie, all right?

204
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,916
No. These are whites-only pies.

205
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,005
-Well, do you have any Negro pies?
-Claude, come on.

206
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,759
This woman ain't got the recipe to it.
Where would she get that?

207
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,303
At another establishment
we can get us some pies.

208
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,847
-How far to the next town?
-Thirty-five miles.

209
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,142
I'm not driving no 35 miles to get no pie.

210
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,269
Lady! Ma'am! Okay?

211
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,273
Now we want some pie. We are hungry.

212
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,276
Billy, we want some pie.

213
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,738
-Let me take care of this.
-Someone must die 'cause we want pie?

214
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,240
Let me take care of 'em.

215
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,077
We're from New York,
my name's Ray Gibson.

216
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,124
How much will it cost to turn one of them
white-only pies into nigger pie?

217
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,919
How about I turn y'all into nigger pie?

218
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,546
-So you said about 35--
-35 miles.

219
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,800
We'll find another establishment
down the road.

220
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,804
Yeah, I didn't know white folks
so serious about pie down here.

221
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,655
-Hey, we're lookin' for Slim.
-You found him.

222
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,286
That's it, fellas.
Thirty-six cases of Mississippi's finest.

223
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,084
-Five bucks a case. That's $180.
-All right.

224
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,753
-What do we got?
-Come on. Pay the man.

225
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,216
That music's hot.
What goes on down there?

226
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,844
That there's Natchez-Under-The-Hill.

227
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,762
Colored folks welcome down there?

228
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,016
-Green's the only color that matters there.
-Is that right?

229
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,309
They got gambling, girls.

230
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,940
-You boys ought to check it out.
-Maybe we will. Nice doing business....

231
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,651
Let's go have ourselves a reward,
see what's shaking.

232
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,696
-Reward?
-There's people there having a good time.

233
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,282
I wanna be one of 'em.
I want you to be one of 'em.

234
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,286
Let me tell you something. Listen.
Monday, you can go be a bank teller.

235
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,622
Tonight, you're a bootlegger
with a truckload of hootch...

236
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,541
...and a fistful of cash.

237
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,918
That's gas money, Ray.

238
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,129
Come on. Think.

239
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,259
Man, you are incredible. Tell you what.
Here's $2.

240
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,304
You stay here, watch the truck.
I'm gonna go have fun.

241
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,890
I got the keys,
if you want to leave me in the woods.

242
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,768
I know how you think, you motherfucker.

243
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,898
This looks like something here.

244
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,694
I'll keep an eye on you.
Make sure you don't do nothin' stupid.

245
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,446
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

246
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,241
Well, step lively.
Don't want them to think I'm from here.

247
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,119
They'll know by how I walk,
I ain't from around here.

248
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,913
'Cause I'm from New York City!

249
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,499
-How y'all doing?
-What's up, country boy?

250
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,008
Tens over nines.

251
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,984
I ain't never seen you in here before.

252
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,321
That's 'cause I ain't never been
in here before.

253
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,907
My name's Sylvia. What's your name?

254
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,081
-Can't you remember your own name?
-I know it begins with a "C."

255
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,959
Well, Mr. "C."

256
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,131
How about buyin' a gal a drink?
Two bourbons.

257
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,302
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep
an eye on my friend over there.

258
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,514
He look like he can take care of hisself.

259
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,338
Claude.

260
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,634
That's my name...Claude.

261
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,679
You know that's never
happened to me before.

262
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,640
You're cute.

263
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,144
Thank you.

264
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,606
You got any money, Claude?

265
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,110
Two dollars, but I need that to get home.

266
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,698
What's wrong?

267
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,242
What you wanna go home for?

268
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,496
It's so early.

269
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,791
I'll take one.

270
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,711
-One for New York.
-Thank you. Me's want one.

271
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,963
-Can I get that for you?
-Thanks, baby.

272
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,675
-Give me a deuce.
-Here you go, honey.

273
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,845
-Thank you.
-All right.

274
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,641
-You all want to pick up this country pace?
-Bet's to you, sir.

275
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,146
-Bet a dollar.
-I'll sees that.

276
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,316
You sees that.

277
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,903
Well, I sees that dollar, and I raise you $2.

278
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,489
Is "sees" a word?

279
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,409
-All right now.
-I'm out.

280
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,995
You goin' back to the farm now?
Pick your tomatoes?

281
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,001
I'll see the two.

282
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,922
And I raise you ten.

283
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,382
Damn. Out.

284
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,808
Mr. Hancock, I don't think
I have any more money.

285
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,479
-Big city boy.
-Well, that's too bad.

286
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,149
Now, hold on.

287
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,860
Just give me two seconds.

288
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,132
Top shelf.

289
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,509
It look good to me.

290
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,803
I think that'll cover it.

291
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,347
Call.

292
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,898
I got a full boat
with the ladies doin' the paddlin'.

293
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:59,277
I don't think they come in
much stronger than that, sir.

294
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,780
Four treys.

295
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,200
What the fuck?

296
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,244
Broke again.

297
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,288
New York. New York.

298
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,335
Don't take it too hard, New York.
Have a round on me.

299
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,638
-Can I get you something, sir?
-No, I'm all right.

300
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,848
Hey! What the fuck is this?

301
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,727
-You're hurtin' my arm.
-Where you goin'?

302
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,855
Hell, no! Hey, Hancock!

303
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,114
Oh, shit.

304
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,555
My goodness.

305
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,726
My old friend, Winston Hancock.

306
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,606
I thought we agreed that
you was gonna leave town.

307
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,654
I was gonna leave, Sheriff Pike...

308
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,117
...but your wife, she begged me to stay.

309
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,351
You just committed suicide, boy.

310
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,148
Ray, I've been lookin' for ya.

311
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,030
Guess we better get goin'.

312
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,785
You still got that $2?

313
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,204
Not exactly.

314
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,081
I met this girl.

315
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,917
Real nice girl. A God-fearing girl.

316
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,587
-The same girl I seen you over here with?
-Yeah.

317
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,507
-Yeah, she looked religious.
-Yeah, well....

318
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,802
So you gave her the $2?

319
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,596
She was in a tight spot.
Her mama needs this operation.

320
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,516
She ain't have the money for it, and so....

321
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,186
The church took up a collection,
but they're short--

322
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,772
-$2 short?
-Uh, yeah.

323
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,025
So I gave it to her.
When the spirit moves me....

324
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,070
We both got fucked.
While you was doing God's work...

325
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:51,074
...l was getting jack-legged by a farmer
and one of these waitresses.

326
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,452
I know the bitch is in here.
They beat me down to my socks.

327
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,830
You lost all our money in a card game?

328
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:00,834
Fuck the money. It's not even about
the money. I lost my daddy's watch.

329
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,086
Fuck that cheap-ass watch.

330
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,923
I apologize. You're right, it has to stop.

331
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,218
Once more, I'll take all your fronts out.

332
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,470
See how you go back to New York.

333
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,306
-That's how you gonna be in the car.
-I'm sorry.

334
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,475
Say something about the watch.

335
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,439
In fact, just bring up watch. Look like you
was fixin' your mouth to say "watch."

336
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,191
I'm gonna whup your ass.
Don't even say "watch."

337
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:29,738
Don't say it around me. Say "little clock"
or some shit. Say "watch," I'm gonna dive.

338
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,740
How do we get home without money?

339
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:34,826
We got 36 cases of booze.
That's better than money.

340
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,579
So we gonna drive home drunk.

341
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,414
-Is that it?
-Let me pay, get out.

342
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,541
-Where's the girl who was here?
-What girl?

343
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:46,087
"What girl?" Next time I come here,
whichever bitch I start choking, that's her.

344
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:51,092
Big-time hustler, came and got girked
by a couple of farmers.

345
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,013
Can it, Claude. I'm all shot,
I just wanna get back to New York.

346
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,477
Oh, shit.

347
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,439
I think he's hurt pretty bad.

348
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,242
This guy's dead.

349
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,537
I ain't never seen no dead body before.

350
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:24,626
What are you doin'? The man's been dead
two seconds, and you're in his pocket.

351
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,420
-Don't you have any respect?
-It ain't here.

352
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,924
-What ain't there?
-My daddy's watch. He took my watch.

353
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,677
Motherfucker, you fucked
with the wrong person.

354
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,471
-Now look at your ass out here bleeding.
-Hey!

355
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,599
What you boys doin' out here?

356
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,727
Hey, how y'all doin'?

357
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,773
We're just takin' care of our friend here.

358
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,067
What's wrong with this one?

359
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:52,153
-Drink.
-Yeah, he's just a little drunk.

360
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,448
-Nothing at all, just a little drunk.
-Nobody drank like old...

361
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,242
-Ah, Winston.
-...Winston.

362
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,870
Old drunk-ass Winston is always drinking.

363
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,039
This fella looks like he's dead.

364
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,207
No.

365
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,252
He's not dead. He's drunk.

366
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,170
He drinks until he passes out.

367
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,923
Let's leave him here to sleep it off.

368
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,342
I'm gonna tell his wife we left him.

369
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,470
-Let's go to the car.
-You boys better come with us.

370
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,264
That's right.

371
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,392
We're gonna go to your car then.

372
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,020
Let's go. We're gonna go with this guy.

373
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,480
You know what, Ray?

374
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:30,775
You're responsible for this whole situation.

375
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,570
I blame you for everything.

376
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,323
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be home now about to have a hot meal.

377
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,535
If not for me, your black ass
would be floating up on a beach.

378
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,288
Remember that, "my finger
and thumbs for adding" shit?

379
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:46,166
-I saved your life.
-They think we killed somebody.

380
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,044
-This is blood, okay?
-Just shut up. Listen.

381
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,046
Just sit down. Let me work it out.

382
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,590
-I got a job, it starts Monday.
-You'll be late.

383
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:57,302
-'Cause I got to work this whole thing out.
-What the....

384
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,598
-Evening, boys.
-Evening there, Sheriff.

385
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,853
Well, well. What do we have here?

386
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,399
Billy Bob and the boys found 'em
under the hill with Winston Hancock.

387
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,528
He was dead. Looks like murder.

388
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,448
-Yep, it does.
-Is that right?

389
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,285
Looks like they was runnin' hootch.
Got 36 cases of evidence.

390
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,830
-How about a little reward, Billy Bob?
-Thank you, sir.

391
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:32,212
Why bother with bootleggin' when we got
a clear-cut case of murder?

392
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,342
Sheriff Pike, like I told your associate,
we didn't kill nobody.

393
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,261
He was like that when we found him.
He was already dead.

394
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,764
Now as far as bootleggin' goes...

395
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:46,893
...l happen to work for a very important
man back East.

396
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,815
Does the name Spanky Johnson
mean anything to you?

397
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,900
Spanky Johnson?

398
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,071
-No, I'm afraid not.
-Hey, Sheriff Pike.

399
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,365
Sheriff Pike, listen.

400
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,245
This guy, Spanky Johnson,
is very well-connected.

401
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,957
Very well-connected.
And if you were to give us a break...

402
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:13,128
...l can guarantee you, he would do
something to show his appreciation.

403
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,463
-Now I'm sure.
-Mr. Pike.

404
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,176
You can buy your way out of trouble
in New York City...

405
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,179
...but down here,
we take murder very seriously.

406
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,683
We didn't kill him.
He was dead when we found him.

407
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,852
That's the truth.

408
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:30,729
The liquor was ours.

409
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:34,733
-There was no breath in him.
-It was our liquor, but the man was dead.

410
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,944
If that's true, you boys don't have anything
to worry about.

411
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,864
I guarantee it. I'll see y'all in the morning.

412
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:44,409
You believe us? What time
you gonna be here in the mornin'?

413
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,329
-Don't drink all that stuff tonight.
-All right, Sheriff.

414
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,625
-See you in the morning.
-He sounded like he believed us.

415
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,962
The man's got a point.
We didn't kill nobody.

416
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,381
What about the truckload of booze?

417
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,717
That's Spanky's booze!

418
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,554
Tomorrow, I'm gonna tell that judge,
"Judge, we didn't murder nobody.

419
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,639
"That was Spanky's booze."

420
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,976
What's the worst that can happen to us?

421
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,436
Life!

422
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,814
What do you mean, "life"?
I ain't doin' no life.

423
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,238
I didn't kill nobody.
The man was dead when I got there.

424
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,436
Welcome to Mississippi.

425
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,898
Here, you will be provided
with ample opportunity...

426
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,902
...to repay your debt to society
through the rigors of hard labor.

427
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:07,367
We got fields need clearin', roads need
buildin' and ditches need diggin'.

428
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,870
You will eat only what you can grow.

429
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,748
Your crop don't come in, you go hungry.

430
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,626
This here is Camp 8.

431
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,964
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

432
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,592
But whatever you done to get here,
believe me, I'm not impressed.

433
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,636
I've seen it all before.

434
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,307
We ain't got no fences here at Camp 8.

435
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:35,478
We don't need no fences.
We got us the gun line.

436
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,813
Tell 'em about the gun line, boss.

437
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,357
This is the gun line.

438
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,570
It runs from shack to shack,
clear around the yard.

439
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,034
You are now inside the gun line.

440
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:54,873
You step outside the gun line
without my permission, you will be shot.

441
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:59,461
You trip and fall over the gun line,
you will be shot.

442
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,838
You spit, you pee...

443
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,675
...you so much as stick
your Johnson out over the gun line...

444
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,635
...you will be shot.

445
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:14,225
And you, Slick,
don't try to run, don't try to escape.

446
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:18,563
One of my trusties
will put a bullet in your head.

447
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,819
You prisoners are now the property
of the state of Mississippi...

448
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:28,281
...which is to say I own your ass.

449
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,576
And in case you haven't met this
handsome young fella...

450
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,536
...this is Hoppin' Bob.

451
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:37,207
You run afoul of Bob, you run afoul of me.

452
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,962
Everybody, shut up! Right now.

453
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,341
I don't wanna hear a sound.
Got some fresh meat for ya.

454
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,594
Right there. Take yourself right there,
find your ass a bunk.

455
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,805
Move it. Actin' all scared.

456
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,810
We ain't got no wallflowers in Camp 8.

457
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,605
Don't y'all worry none.

458
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,483
Ain't nobody gonna mess with ya tonight.

459
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:06,569
That'd take all the fun out the courtship.

460
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,738
You hear me, boy?

461
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:14,160
I didn't see nothing special the first time
Ray and Claude walked into the cage.

462
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:18,540
To me, they were just a couple of fools
whose luck had run out.

463
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,918
'Course, I was wrong about that.

464
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,911
I don't believe this "before Abe" shit.

465
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,332
I didn't go to night school to dig no ditch.

466
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,755
What are you doing? I wouldn't do that.

467
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:10,508
Shut up. What do you know anyway?
It's too damn hot.

468
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:15,221
-Why ain't that boy's pick swingin'?
-Why ain't that pick swingin'?

469
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,557
Why ain't that pick swingin', nigger?

470
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,518
It's too hot. I'm tired, boss.

471
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,980
He said he's too hot, boss. He's tired.

472
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,067
Too hot? He's tired?

473
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,446
You tell that lazy jigaboo
the state of Mississippi...

474
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:34,783
...ain't interested
in his meteorological assessments!

475
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,701
Listen up, jigaboo!

476
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:40,246
The state of Mississippi
ain't interested in your...

477
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,167
...your "metacalogical" assessments!

478
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,088
You tell him the state of Mississippi
is only interested...

479
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,674
...in gettin' this here ditch cleared
by sundown.

480
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:55,178
State of Mississippi wants this here ditch
cleared by sundown. Got that?

481
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,390
Got it, boss.

482
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:04,229
-He don't sound like he from around here.
-He from New York City, boss.

483
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,064
That one there too.

484
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,858
They'll find we do things different here.

485
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,027
Yeah, we noticed.

486
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:18,201
Don't smart me, boy.
Just shut your mouth and do your work.

487
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,710
Looks like we got a couple of live ones.

488
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,755
-How long these boys in for?
-The judge gave 'em the long ride, boss.

489
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,340
Life, huh?

490
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:37,178
They step out of line again,
we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.

491
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:43,059
Get them picks a-swinging!
You heard me, New York Cities.

492
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,104
You don't want me to come down there.

493
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:50,400
I ain't nice like Boss.
I'll slap the black off your ass.

494
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,402
Get to work!

495
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:00,910
Either one of you new fellas
know how to read?

496
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,662
I know how to read. Why?

497
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:05,040
I've been carrying this letter
for four months.

498
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,125
You mean none of y'all can read?

499
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,712
Last fella that could read
made parole around Christmas.

500
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,132
I don't even know who this come from.

501
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,259
Give me this.

502
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,553
You can't read?

503
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,640
Almost 60 years old,
motherfucker can't read.

504
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,394
It's from your mama's neighbor,
Mrs. Tadwell.

505
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,604
You know who?

506
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,732
She thought you ought to know
your second cousin, Bo, died.

507
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:35,445
Bo died. And your cousin,
Sally, on your daddy's side, she died.

508
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,449
-And apparently your sister died too.
-Jenny?

509
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,285
No, it say Marleen here. Marleen died.

510
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,913
Oh, no. Jenny died too.

511
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,040
Jenny and Marleen both dead.

512
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:51,878
It goes on for a while about how the crop
didn't come in on account of the frost.

513
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,633
She ends saying there was a big tornado...

514
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:59,386
...in which your mama and daddy
were both killed.

515
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,430
Don't worry,
'cause she gonna take care of the dog.

516
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,725
That is, if he gets over the worms.
Dog had worms.

517
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,313
-Appreciate it.
-Yeah, you know, anytime I can help out.

518
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,693
Anybody else got something
they want read?

519
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,861
Can't blame y'all.

520
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,536
-How ya doin'?
-I'm fine, thanks.

521
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,788
Good. First time in?

522
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,166
Nah, not at all.

523
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,086
I've been in and out of prison, mostly in.

524
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:37,257
So you won't have no problem adjusting?

525
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,176
Shouldn't have a problem, no.

526
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,262
If you need anything...

527
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:45,515
...of any kind, give me a holler.

528
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,768
My name's Jangle Leg.

529
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,023
-I appreciate it. Jangle Leg?
-Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg.

530
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:56,151
-I'm Claude.
-Claude.

531
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,487
Your hand nice and supple, like a lady.

532
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:06,494
Jangle Leg! What the hell I tell you
about pitchin' woo on the job, boy?

533
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,666
Sorry, Cap'n.

534
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,754
Story time is over.
All you sissies get back to work right now.

535
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,388
-He made a pass at me.
-Yeah, I see.

536
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:29,434
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?

537
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:32,020
You're gonna find out before me.

538
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,738
-Eyes front, mister.
-Everybody doing that.

539
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:48,661
I'm hungry.

540
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,681
-See how you get that off?
-Eat and stop aggravating people.

541
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,599
I ain't aggravating nobody.

542
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,936
You got nerve, scraping toast and shit,
making excess noise.

543
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,481
-You're making a lotta noise there.
-The spoon, it's filthy.

544
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:19,984
-Filthy, ain't it?
-Fuck that spoon and just eat.

545
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:23,613
-I'm Ray Gibson, this is Claude Banks.
-Willie Long.

546
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,868
-You seem sensible. Why you in here?
-It's a long story.

547
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,538
At 13, he killed a son of a bitch
with a claw hammer.

548
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,707
-So they say.
-A lot of people say it.

549
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,335
-Wait, you been in here since you were 13?
-That's right.

550
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,671
How about you? How long you been here?

551
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:43,133
-He chopped his sister with an axe.
-She was my half-sister...

552
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:46,386
...so I cut her ass in half,
but I didn't poison my ma and pa.

553
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:49,222
-Now tell that. Tell that.
-They deserved it, Radio.

554
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:52,517
What you talkin' about?
You skinned your landlady alive...

555
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,769
...and made a jacket out of her.

556
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,105
Well, at least he didn't kill Santa Claus.

557
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,107
Santa? Which one of you killed him?

558
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,861
It wasn't Santa Claus. He was just
wearing the suit and ringing a bell.

559
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,904
-He had presents.
-I ain't get nothing.

560
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:08,283
You killed a Salvation man,
the dude on the street with the bell?

561
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,201
-Something like that.
-He did.

562
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,661
Nobody tried to escape?

563
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:15,540
-They never get too far.
-Cookie got to Greenville a few years ago.

564
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,918
Take a mighty cagey country boy
to navigate the woods.

565
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,920
Gotta know what you're doin'.

566
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,381
What'd y'all do?

567
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,886
What the fuck did y'all do?

568
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,891
-We went on...
-The most violent--

569
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,476
...a violent killing spree.

570
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,145
All around the country
we've been killing people.

571
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:40,106
All month. If y'all was out
and reading the papers....

572
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,525
Ain't heard about it? Claude and Ray?

573
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,820
Sometimes you got to do certain shit....

574
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:50,075
-He'd cut your throat.
-I go where I need to go to get it done.

575
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,328
If you push my button,
there's no telling what I may do...

576
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,580
...stab you, choke you, bite you.

577
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,917
I'd do whatever it takes to make
a motherfucker stop existing.

578
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,044
I could stab a nigger right now.

579
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,838
I beat a motherfucker to death.
Don't fuck with us.

580
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,383
You don't really wanna fuck with us.

581
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,843
Press the wrong button, nigger pop.

582
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:11,805
Hey, girl. You gonna eat your corn bread?

583
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,892
-Oh, trouble.
-Don't say nothin' to him.

584
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:19,896
You talkin' to me?

585
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:22,315
Yeah, I think he's talking to you.

586
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,694
No, not at all. I want you to have it.

587
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,863
Willie, you mind passing this down to....

588
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:31,658
No. Don't pass your corn bread to him.

589
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:34,369
-That's your corn bread.
-I'm a grown man.

590
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:37,831
I'm not gonna eat this.
If he wants the corn bread, have it.

591
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:41,126
If he wants corn bread,
let him up to the front and get his own.

592
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:43,378
That's your corn bread. Fuck him.

593
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,839
He gonna eat his corn bread. Fuck you.

594
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,925
I don't need you to take up for me.

595
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,636
I'm a grown man. I can handle it.

596
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,764
If you let him have it,
you'll be ironing his drawers.

597
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:58,852
-I ain't gonna be ironing.
-Maybe I ought to eat your corn bread.

598
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,772
Motherfucker, you can't have
my corn bread, that's for damn sure.

599
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,442
If you try to take it,
part two of my killin' spree...

600
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:07,610
...gonna begin up here on your ass now.

601
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,196
If you're thinkin' about my corn bread,
forget it.

602
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,615
-That's for sure. Fuck that.
-Cool it.

603
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,118
I'm from New York City, goddamn it.

604
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:16,995
Nobody take no corn bread from me.

605
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:20,415
That go for you and any other
of you motherfucking farmers.

606
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:24,586
You fuck around with me, there's gonna
be consequences and repercussions.

607
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,422
Get up!

608
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:47,025
Come on! Show that son of a bitch
how y'all do it in Harlem.

609
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,173
Come on, New York.

610
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:24,729
I appreciate you taking the trouble
over my corn bread.

611
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:27,315
You don't get a lot of compliments here.

612
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,535
Get up!

613
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:43,623
I think you made your point,
whatever that is.

614
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:47,460
Now's a good time to throw in the towel,
you know what I'm sayin'?

615
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,506
Not over no corn bread.

616
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:02,267
Goldmouth, I know a bitch
named Della hit harder than you.

617
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:12,193
That's it.
The man's taken enough of a beating.

618
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:16,448
Goldmouth, pick him up
and carry him on inside.

619
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,337
He ain't gettin' my corn bread.

620
00:44:37,552 --> 00:44:40,263
You were scared, huh? Don't be scared.

621
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:13,672
Papa!

622
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,257
That's my boy.

623
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:23,431
Request permission
to go to the tonk, boss.

624
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:26,726
Conjugal visits
are for married prisoners only...

625
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,145
...and I don't see no weddin' ring.

626
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,940
Can't you make an exception?

627
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:37,278
I could issue a temporary marriage license,
for a nominal fee.

628
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,411
-Here you go.
-Sure is pretty.

629
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,665
I now pronounce you man and wife.

630
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:50,709
You go have a good time.

631
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:56,256
Claude Banks going to the tonk!

632
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:02,679
-Come on, now.
-Five cents.

633
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,809
Hey, New York.
You ever been to that Cotton Club?

634
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:10,353
The Cotton Club in Manhattan?
Many times.

635
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:13,398
I damn near lived in the Cotton Club.
It's all right.

636
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:15,692
They ain't got nothin'
on the Boom-Boom Room.

637
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:18,820
You ever go to New York,
go to Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

638
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:20,947
What is the Boom-Boom Room?

639
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:24,367
That's my spot.
Most happening space in Manhattan.

640
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:27,245
So you got your own nightclub?

641
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:30,457
It's kinda in the development stages,
but I'm working on it.

642
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,958
So it don't exist?

643
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,960
It exists in my mind.

644
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:37,339
It start your brain first.

645
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:39,924
As a man think it, so shall he get.

646
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:43,219
Some shit like that.
You know, you read the Bible.

647
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:47,432
Did you go see my cousin Melvin
like I asked you to in my letter?

648
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:50,810
Of course, I did.
He said he'd file an appeal right away.

649
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,856
Melvin wanted to know...

650
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:57,233
...if he should file an appeal for your friend.

651
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:58,943
Ray Gibson? No.

652
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,948
No, Daisy.

653
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:09,537
He's the reason I'm in here.
He's got a record a mile long.

654
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:12,415
I got a better shot of gettin' outta here
on my own.

655
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:16,753
You tell Melvin to think about me.
Just concentrate on me.

656
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:26,179
-Cookie made me a map to Greenville.
-So?

657
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:29,391
-You know what I'm sayin'.
-I know what you're sayin'.

658
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:33,645
If you made it that far, they'd check
every train that pulls out of the station.

659
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:38,316
We ain't takin' the train. There's a farm
on the map and a boat on the farm.

660
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,319
You know about boats?
You probably don't know how to swim.

661
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:45,240
I know a boat can help sail our ass
away from here. We can do this shit.

662
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:47,283
-Why are you always saying "we"?
-What?

663
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:50,662
There's no "we."
There's a me, and there's a you.

664
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:54,249
-Why're you talkin' so loud?
-There ain't no "we" between us.

665
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:06,970
Hey, Ray!

666
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:10,974
Yeah?

667
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:14,561
What's the name
of that nightclub of yours again?

668
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:17,647
-You talkin' about the Boom-Boom Room?
-Yeah.

669
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:22,485
That's it. I'd sure like to see that place
when you get it all up and runnin'.

670
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:26,114
-Yeah, me too.
-Me too. I'd like to see that room too.

671
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:30,618
You should've been there last night.
You'd have had big fun.

672
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:32,954
What you talkin' about, "last night"?

673
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,248
Just like I said, last night.

674
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:38,043
Satchmo was there
and nearly blew the roof off.

675
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:40,086
-Ray, who that?
-Satchmo.

676
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,297
You mean Louis Armstrong?

677
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,257
I call him Satchmo. I know him.

678
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,761
I call him Satchmo,
and he come by whenever he in town.

679
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:51,181
Ain't nobody wanting to hear that bullshit.

680
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,476
Shut the fuck up.

681
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:57,604
Always saying things at the wrong time.

682
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:59,981
Go to sleep. Let us have our fun.

683
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:02,400
Finish telling us about Satchmo.

684
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,194
Go ahead, tell me more.

685
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,532
As I was sayin',
last night y'all should've come by.

686
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,160
You'll never guess who'll be there tonight.

687
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:14,162
Who gonna be there?

688
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:16,289
-Who that, Ray?
-Just guess.

689
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:21,461
"l got a man that's more than 8-foot tall

690
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:24,589
"Four foot shoulders and that ain't all

691
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,841
"He's a king-sized papa

692
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,511
"He's my king-sized papa"

693
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,137
Sing, girl!

694
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:35,475
"l take the door off the hinges
When my baby comes to call"

695
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:38,978
Catch any cab headin' uptown...

696
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:42,190
...all the drivers know
about Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

697
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:43,858
Ray! Where am l?

698
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,696
Goldmouth,
somebody's gotta watch the door.

699
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,868
Now I could get used to this. Ladies.

700
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,959
Ray, this steak tastes like butter.

701
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:03,003
Made it just for you, Cookie.

702
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:06,548
-You got some steak sauce?
-Boy, get us some Worcestershire sauce.

703
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:09,718
And clean off that damn table,
or I'll whup your ass.

704
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,306
Is something wrong with your ears?
Move it!

705
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:18,351
Ray! I know your club got gambling.

706
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:21,312
Poker.
Wouldn't be a club without some dice.

707
00:50:22,772 --> 00:50:26,526
Lucky seven! My man! Let it ride!

708
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:29,237
All right, Poker, lettin' it ride.

709
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:36,202
-Raid! Don't move!
-Shit! Party's over.

710
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,663
-Son of a bitch!
-Goddamn! Party over.

711
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,417
Get the back door!
Put all the women in my car! Gibson!

712
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:46,379
You about ready to spend
the night in the hole.

713
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:49,549
Now shut up and go to sleep.
You got that?

714
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:53,803
That goes for the rest of you girls too.

715
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:58,058
Now I don't wanna hear another peep
about no fuckin' Boom-Boom Room.

716
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,728
Sorry, Cap'n.

717
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:04,314
Shut your mouth and your fat ass.

718
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:08,943
Don't be playing with yourselves.
You gotta work in the morning.

719
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,783
Mail call!

720
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:18,787
That's mine.

721
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,706
You know I hate this part,
it's too hard for me.

722
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,709
I'm gonna get back
to that game in a little while.

723
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,681
-Right here.
-Melvin Banks, Esquire, Attorney at Law.

724
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:41,142
-What's going on?
-This don't concern you. Excuse me.

725
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,311
Yeah, obviously not.

726
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:49,401
Slow up. You see me countin'.

727
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:51,069
Go on. Come on.

728
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:54,823
This here is Biscuit.
This is New York City One...

729
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,200
Let's move on!

730
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:59,577
Only 15 hours of daylight left.

731
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,456
Got all my rocks here, boss.

732
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:08,211
Sure is hot. Think it's gonna rain later?

733
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,590
-What you want?
-What makes you think I want something?

734
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:16,261
My dad told me when someone talks about
the weather, watch your wallet.

735
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:18,763
Your daddy must have been a wise man.

736
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:21,975
Cut the shit and tell me what you want.

737
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,185
You still got that map?

738
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:26,438
Yeah, I still got it. Why?

739
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:30,942
If you thinkin' about bookin' it, I want in.

740
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:33,111
I think we can make it.

741
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:36,489
Didn't you tell me there was no "we"?

742
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:41,202
Now it's "we" again? What happened?
Bad news in that letter?

743
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,874
My cousin Melvin is a lawyer
and he filed an appeal on my behalf.

744
00:52:45,957 --> 00:52:48,585
On your behalf? What happened to "we"?

745
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,920
-The appeal was denied.
-I'm glad.

746
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:54,299
Daisy fell for Melvin.
They're engaged to be married.

747
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:56,801
-Can you believe that?
-That's hard to believe.

748
00:52:56,885 --> 00:53:00,805
He a big, successful New York lawyer
and you here with a bright future in cotton.

749
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:04,559
Let me figure it out for you.
Eenie, meenie, miney, Melvin!

750
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,979
Come on, Ray. I'm serious.

751
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:11,524
Don't shut me out.
You, me, the map...we can go places.

752
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:14,069
The whole time we been here...

753
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:16,071
...you just blame this shit on me.

754
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,365
And you just think about yourself.

755
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:21,201
-Your little scheme. Was I part of that?
-No.

756
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:24,162
You'll be honest now
'cause you wanna be friends.

757
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,749
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. My-Shit-Don't-Stink Banks.

758
00:53:27,832 --> 00:53:31,461
You got to learn a whole lot more
about friendship.

759
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:33,755
Boss, he ain't workin'!

760
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:39,803
-Does this mean I'm in?
-Nah, you'd probably slow me down.

761
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,555
You'll be worrying about
your silverware being clean.

762
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,141
You one of them soft motherfuckers.

763
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:48,061
-What you say?
-I said you soft. So what?

764
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,648
-What you gonna do?
-No man calls me soft. I hate that!

765
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:54,609
I'm a man, and I called you soft.

766
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:57,821
I don't like you swellin' all up.

767
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:00,073
Why you takin' in all this air for?

768
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:02,242
What's on your mind?

769
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:04,994
You gonna put your chin up?
That mean something to me?

770
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,080
'Cause I said "soft"? So what?

771
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:09,791
I spell it. S-O-F-capital-T!

772
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,794
Soft! What you gonna do?

773
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:20,176
You must be crazy. I'll kill you.

774
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,263
-Oh, this is good.
-Break it up!

775
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:35,775
I'm gettin' ready to shoot somebody here!

776
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,861
I'm gonna shoot a motherfucker today.

777
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:40,196
Ain't gonna forget this,
you New York Cities.

778
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,116
-He started it.
-Don't go to sleep, nigger.

779
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,287
I don't mess with nobody. You know that.

780
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,253
Get back to work.

781
00:54:55,837 --> 00:54:58,631
This ain't over, nigger.
I don't give a fuck what he say.

782
00:54:58,715 --> 00:54:59,841
I'll shoot your ass.

783
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:01,634
Don't go to sleep!

784
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,429
We'll see who go to sleep.

785
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,654
Shit. Come on! Two running!

786
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:33,208
I know these trees all look alike,
but this one is awful familiar.

787
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:35,043
Let me see that map.

788
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,091
You call this a map?

789
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,135
What was Cookie smokin'
when he drew this?

790
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,971
Cookie didn't draw it. I drew it up.

791
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:51,267
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You don't know where we're goin'.

792
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,145
I drew it 'cause you wouldn't come
unless I had a map.

793
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,398
Now come on!

794
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:59,234
Wait up. Wait up!

795
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,396
Take the dogs around the house!

796
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:40,025
Y'all bring the dogs with me! Come on!

797
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,821
Come on!

798
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:04,549
Here they are, Superintendent.

799
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:07,469
Tracked 'em all the way
to the Tallahatchie.

800
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:09,846
That's quite a ways, isn't it?

801
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:12,515
I'm glad you New York boys
got to see some of...

802
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,018
...our beautiful countryside
while we got you here.

803
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:16,353
Mae Rose!

804
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:21,399
What do you think we oughta do
to teach 'em a lesson?

805
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:24,778
A night in the hole?

806
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:27,739
A night in the hole. Better make it a week.

807
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,555
No, don't move so fast.

808
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,190
Fuck y'all!

809
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:05,068
-Hey, Claude!
-What?

810
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,320
You got a toilet in yours?

811
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:09,948
That was the first time
that Ray and Claude ran...

812
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:11,074
...but it sure wasn't the last.

813
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,619
Japan suffers its
most crushing defeat of the war.

814
00:58:15,912 --> 00:58:19,332
Years passed, and the world went to war
for a second time.

815
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:24,504
While they was fightin' for freedom
on the outside...

816
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:27,716
...we were dreamin' about it on the inside.

817
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:31,261
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

818
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,557
Whatever you done, I'm not impressed.

819
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,600
I've seen it all before.

820
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:41,021
You probably noticed that we got
no fences at Camp 8.

821
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:44,649
We don't need fences
'cause we got a gun line.

822
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:46,526
It runs from....

823
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,534
What the hell you doin'?

824
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,414
The boy can't talk.
Somethin' wrong with his head.

825
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:03,251
Just can't get right, boss.

826
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,671
"Can't get right."

827
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:10,216
All right. We'll see how long he lasts.

828
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,011
-Where was l?
-We don't need no fences at Camp 8.

829
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:16,639
-What?
-We don't need no fences here at Camp 8.

830
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,434
-The gun line, boss.
-Yes.

831
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:22,937
You prisoners are now inside the gun line.

832
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:26,024
When Dillard found out
that Claude was a baseball man...

833
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:28,109
...he put him in charge of the team.

834
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:31,571
That way, when we lost,
he could blame it on somebody else.

835
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,535
No, that's not it.

836
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:45,126
Try to teach 'em the finer points
of the game...

837
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:47,962
...share my wisdom, but do they listen?

838
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,590
They damn sure don't learn.

839
00:59:51,174 --> 00:59:53,385
You're dealin' with a total lack of talent.

840
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:55,428
Ain't nobody got no talent.

841
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:58,223
Every year,
Camp 12 wins the championship.

842
00:59:58,306 --> 01:00:01,935
Every year they get to roast a victory pig.
This year, I want that pig.

843
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:04,604
Jangle Leg, put it right to him.

844
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:10,235
That's what I'm talking about!

845
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:12,904
Who wants to hit next?

846
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:16,408
-Find the card.
-Don't nobody wanna hit?

847
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,326
Do you wanna hit?

848
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,371
Let Can't Get Right have a swing.

849
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:25,125
-Him?
-He can't be worse than the rest.

850
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,627
Let the boy have a swing.

851
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:33,008
Let's see what you can do.

852
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:37,345
Put that bat in your hand,
hold it tight and take a nice swing.

853
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:41,850
Jangle Leg, a little easy on him.

854
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,104
-He's new, so we don't wanna--
-Don't try to hurt the man.

855
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:52,402
Even swing, Can't Get Right.

856
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:55,071
Don't be scared of the ball.

857
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:05,498
That wasn't bad.

858
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,709
Put that on it.

859
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,129
That might have been
one of those retard mistakes.

860
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:24,893
Give him that tricky one.

861
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:42,327
Damn.

862
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,497
Daddy!

863
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:49,376
-That's just like fresh water.
-Hey, my little girl.

864
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:52,796
-Look like little Mae Rose done growed up.
-And out.

865
01:01:53,296 --> 01:01:55,006
That girl got gams.

866
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,676
How was the honeymoon?

867
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,928
-You gonna stay for supper?
-'Fraid not.

868
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:02,138
I'm shippin' out this afternoon.

869
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:05,266
You lookin' a little bit too hard.

870
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:09,354
Duh, my ass. You better just....

871
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:12,440
Turn around to the left.
We have a problem.

872
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:14,609
It's all right to glance occasionally...

873
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:17,612
...but you look like you wanted to go
and start fucking.

874
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:21,700
Turn around. I'm keepin' you out
of some trouble. Paint the fence.

875
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,576
Banks! Get over here.

876
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:26,496
I'll be right back.

877
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,625
Stan Blocker,
a scout for the nigger leagues.

878
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:33,044
Negro leagues, actually.

879
01:02:33,586 --> 01:02:35,880
Pittsburgh Crawfords. Ever hear of us?

880
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,425
We get the games on the radio sometimes.

881
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:40,760
We played in Jackson yesterday...

882
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:43,388
...heard you got a boy who can hit the ball.

883
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,516
You must mean Can't Get Right.

884
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:49,019
That's him over there.

885
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,896
"Can't Get Right"? That's the kid's name?

886
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,231
Yep.

887
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:56,067
Can I talk to him?

888
01:02:56,609 --> 01:03:00,613
You could try, but you won't get too far.
Why're you interested?

889
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:04,409
Crawfords are always looking
for new talent.

890
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:08,496
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but this is a prison.

891
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,749
There are ways around that.

892
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:12,709
Right, Sergeant?

893
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:14,544
One never knows.

894
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:18,882
Nice looking squad.

895
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:28,725
-Look at the way she glows.
-She is pretty, isn't she?

896
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:30,185
Thanks, Mom.

897
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:34,230
And we're gonna have a baby.
Oh my goodness.

898
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,950
Can't Get Right, no, you can't do that.

899
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:51,539
Let's keep what mind you got focused.

900
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:55,919
If you hit that ball,
you might be our ticket off this farm.

901
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:57,962
Come on. Think victory.

902
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:02,467
The ball! Keep your eye on the ball.

903
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,804
Get up underneath that motherfucker.
Do your thing!

904
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,848
Put some of that dumb strength on it!

905
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,145
We gonna knock that shit
right off the team!

906
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:19,859
That's what I'm talkin' about!

907
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,445
Don't stand there! Run!

908
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:24,948
Run! Go! Just haul ass!

909
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:27,242
Run, nigger, run!

910
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,746
Oh, that's our ticket off this farm.

911
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,466
You mark my words.

912
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,428
In five years, there'll be
a colored man in the majors.

913
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:49,514
I don't think the world changed that much.

914
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:51,766
Maybe not yet, but it will.

915
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,643
I'll be out of a job.

916
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,937
That's some tasty hootch.

917
01:04:56,021 --> 01:05:00,025
It's amazing what Ray can do
with potato skins and some molasses.

918
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:04,237
What you think about our boy?
He got something?

919
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,489
He could be the next Josh Gibson.

920
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:11,536
It's getting late, boys.
We got a game in Memphis tomorrow.

921
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:13,830
What about us?
Don't forget to mention us.

922
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:17,334
'Cause we like his handlers.
We take care of everything for him.

923
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,127
I'll put in a good word for you.

924
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,087
He can't function without us.

925
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:23,298
-You've done a good job with him.
-Thanks.

926
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:26,593
-We're hands-on with him.
-Okay. All right.

927
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:28,595
-Take care.
-Have a nice day.

928
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,431
-Walked off with my drink.
-Sure did.

929
01:05:31,514 --> 01:05:35,435
I ain't gonna say nothin'. Have a good day!

930
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,439
-Y'all come on over here!
-Y'all got something to drink?

931
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:41,941
Look what we got! Some of your stuff.

932
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,861
Can't Get Right, this one's for you, baby!

933
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:56,956
What in the world?

934
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:00,627
What?

935
01:06:05,423 --> 01:06:08,468
-Is Mae Rose all right?
-She's doin' just fine.

936
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,845
What about the baby?

937
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:14,099
He's a big'un.

938
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:17,394
"He"? It's a boy? Honey, it's a boy!

939
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:20,772
Yeah, buddy!

940
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,191
Let me see that boy! Where is that boy?

941
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:25,151
Show me that grandboy!

942
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:31,324
I want every man in this camp
on the line right now!

943
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,119
Right now! I mean right now!

944
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:36,746
Bring 'em out here! Let me see 'em!

945
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:09,404
Hope not. It was somebody in this camp.

946
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,991
I can feel it in my bones.
