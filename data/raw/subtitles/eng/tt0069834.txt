00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500


2
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,501
Somebody's coming, Ben.

3
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:47,749
Yeah, how many?

4
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:49,831
Don't know, couldn't tell.

5
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,164
Just one.

6
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,095
I think i know him.

7
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,248
Hello, J.D.

8
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:06,537
Ben.

9
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:08,995
How've you been?

10
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,201
So-so.

11
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,329
You?

12
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,460
Can't complain.

13
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,221
You with them, Lightfoot,
or just passing through?

14
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:27,719
If i told you once, J.D.,
I've told you a dozen times.

15
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,723
My name is Chief Lightfoot.

16
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,733
And i'm a bona fide war chief
of the Comanche nation.

17
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,605
- And you and l...
- You didn't answer my question.

18
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,238
I'll make it plain.

19
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,529
Do i have to shoot you or not?

20
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,739
Stopped by for a cup of coffee.

21
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:43,745
Very good cup.

22
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:46,781
You figure i owe you anything, Ben?

23
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:47,988
Nope.

24
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,103
I got a warrant for the three of you and...

25
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:11,850
Pee Wee Simser.

26
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:16,232
- That's you over at the left, Pee Wee?
- That's right, J.D.

27
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,862
That's me.

28
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:20,856
And Joe Meehan,i see you.

29
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,283
Any of you want to surrender?

30
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,867
Now, what did you say?

31
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:31,662
I said, "Any of you want to surrender?"

32
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,497
Five of us and one of you?

33
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:41,381
I'll say one thing for you, J.D.

34
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,637
You got style.

35
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,089
Yes, sir, you got style.

36
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,816
Oh, no, you ain't.

37
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:30,578
You ain't gonna get me today,
you dirty, beady-eyed little sons.

38
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:34,363
Little Pee Wee ain't gonna die today,
you filthy scavengers.

39
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,367
Oh, shut up, Simser.

40
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,795
Buzzard bites you,
he'd never eat meat again.

41
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:00,354
J.D.?

42
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,245
I can hear. You don't have to shout.
What do you want?

43
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,580
J.D., i'm suffering the tortures
of the damned back here.

44
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,830
- Now, my leg is killing me. Can't we just...
- Don't start crybabying, Pee Wee.

45
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:23,957
I know the sound
of that old Spencer of yours.

46
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,591
You put a slug in the meaty part
of my left shoulder.

47
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,047
You knowed damn well
I've been shot there twice before.

48
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:32,795
You knowed.

49
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,549
Damn it, J.D.

50
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,044
These things is too tight.

51
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:11,385
There ain't no reason to chain us up
like a bunch of dogs.

52
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,551
Meehan!

53
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,186
Dad-blast it, J.D.

54
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,142
You ain't gonna sleep
with that Greener on cock, are you?

55
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,691
That's right.

56
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:28,071
If you even twitch your finger by accident,
you could blow our heads off.

57
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:30,907
If you call the tune, you pay the piper.

58
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,275
Meaning, if you don't like the treatment...

59
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,161
don't rob the banks.

60
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,098
Billy Joe!

61
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,185
Billy Joe Cahill!

62
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,569
Coming, Denver!

63
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,445
Make it mighty damn pronto.

64
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,523
It's time you was in bed.

65
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:31,884
There you are.

66
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,752
I don't know
what's got into you boys lately.

67
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,760
This morning i sent your brother
into town with Struther...

68
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,053
and he ain't back yet.
Now i can't get you to go to bed.

69
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,386
- I'm going.
- Damn right you are.

70
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:46,309
This is the last trip that Danny makes
with that Struther.

71
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,808
I told your pa it was a mistake to hire him.

72
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,812
Would the marshal listen to me? No.

73
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,941
He rides off and leaves me
with everything to worry about.

74
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,195
Denver?

75
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,443
I'm awful tired. Can i go to bed now?

76
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,659
Sooner the better. Get plenty of rest...

77
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,831
cause we got a lot of darn work
to do tomorrow.

78
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,222
All right, the plates.

79
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,855
Whoa, boy.

80
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,279
Giddyup!

81
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,962
Get out of here.

82
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,327
That's all right.

83
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,173
Mr. Grady.

84
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,844
Can you spare one of them cigars?

85
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,094
Pay you back as soon as I get out.

86
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,183
How old are you, boy?

87
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,685
Seventeen...

88
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,819
going on 18.

89
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,111
Is that right, Struther?

90
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,988
He was 17 last week.

91
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,868
But he's a man full-grown, if you ask me.

92
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,612
And capable of making up
his own mind about...

93
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,449
cigars or whatever.

94
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,999
Ain't that right, Danny?

95
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,875
Yes, sir, you betcha.

96
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,546
His old man is gonna kick you
from here to California...

97
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,752
when he finds out how you've been
watching out over his boy.

98
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,465
I told you he was a man.
We're friends, is all.

99
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,382
I ain't watching over him.

100
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,051
Well, you should be.

101
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,345
I knew J.D. was wrong
when he took custody of you.

102
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,062
Promised the judge
you'd never use that knife again.

103
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,233
- You're nothing but a two-bit little...
- Sheriff?

104
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,818
Jimmy Kane's bringing in Charlie Smith,
and drunk as usual.

105
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,115
What's wrong, Charlie?
You're not due here till Thursday next.

106
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,702
I don't know.

107
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,955
Sheriff, the Devil called...

108
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,749
And i come running.

109
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,008
Fire in the Simpson stable, Sheriff!

110
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,095
- God Almighty. That place will go up...
- I'm coming, Sheriff!

111
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,553
No, you're not.
You'd fall asleep and get roasted.

112
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,634
Now get in your cell!

113
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,354
Fire!

114
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,566
Sure get excited about...

115
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,153
a little fire.

116
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,280
That's what we've heard.

117
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,497
Come on, she's burning fast!

118
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,995
Pull harder!

119
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,373
All right. Get her moving.

120
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,125
Don't i know you, boy?

121
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,544
Danny Cahill, Mr. Smith.

122
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,549
J.D. 's boy?

123
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,588
Yes, sir.

124
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,801
I don't want to be inquisitive...

125
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,305
but what are you in here for?

126
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,976
Drunk and disorderly.

127
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,021
I heard about it. Yeah.

128
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,233
You busted up the Liberty Saloon
real good.

129
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,450
Did $37 damage.

130
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,831
Your pa's knowed around some, ain't he?

131
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,262
I reckon he's been knowed around
a few campfires and public hangings.

132
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,018
That old worn-out drunk
sure puts rust on the blade for us.

133
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,267
He could swallow his tongue.

134
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,394
What?

135
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,316
A lot of boozers I've knowed...

136
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,325
just kinda swallowed their tongue
and never woke up.

137
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,247
I can put a pillow over the dog's head
and smother him.

138
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,536
Fraser!

139
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,659
What you talking about?

140
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,042
We said nobody would get hurt,
and nobody is.

141
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,666
That old coot ain't even gonna wake up
until outhouse call in the morning.

142
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,503
Yeah, that's right.

143
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:34,550
Danny, it's gonna take more than
old Charlie there to mess up our plans.

144
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,352
Give them to me.

145
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,444
Denver's madder than hell, Danny.

146
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,399
I'm thinking we oughta change our minds
while we still can.

147
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,941
Now, Billy Joe,
that just ain't no Christian attitude...

148
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,779
That's your privilege.

149
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,119
Plain fact is that you're both...

150
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,370
young.

151
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,242
If you're gonna go backwatering on me,
I ain't going to hold it against you.

152
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,294
He's flimflamming us, Danny.

153
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,133
He thinks that being young
is the same as being stupid.

154
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,925
You go whichever way you want...

155
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,214
but that barn out there
ain't gonna burn forever.

156
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,804
Give him the keys, Billy Joe.

157
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,350
Kinda hate to set ourselves against Pa.

158
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,552
Pa?

159
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,230
That cranky old cowhand Denver
has been more of a pa to you than J.D.

160
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,310
Ain't that right, Danny?

161
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,153
The hell with J.D. Cahill.

162
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,493
Let's go rob ourselves a bank, Billy Joe.

163
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,905
Give me the keys.

164
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,506
Struther!

165
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,409
Come on!

166
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,660
Move it. Watch what you're doing!

167
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,742
Move that bucket.

168
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,080
Pump faster!

169
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,001
Get that water on the roof!

170
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,278
Now get at it!

171
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,461
All right, move.

172
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,338
Throw the water!

173
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,136
Come on. Get it over where the fire is!
A little bit lower.

174
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,968
Keep pumping there!

175
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,233
Sheriff!

176
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,323
Come on, now!

177
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,157
- The bank's being robbed.
- What?

178
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,918
The bank's being robbed.

179
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,282
Sheriff!

180
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,962
Gordine, stay on the fire. Jim, the bank.

181
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,293
Get on the pumps. Go!

182
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,546
All right, pour it on there!

183
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,970
Get water on that roof there!

184
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,313
- Remember, nobody's to get hurt!
- Get back.

185
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,031
Sheriff!

186
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,366
Sheriff Grady.

187
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,455
Come on.

188
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,715
Oh, Danny.

189
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,566
All right.

190
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,328
Get on inside.

191
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,235
Not you!

192
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,242
Now, where's that boy?

193
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,927
I seen it, Danny.

194
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,726
I seen them both killed.

195
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,101
There's nothing i could do. I tried.

196
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,562
- Boy, you listen to me!
- Hey!

197
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,644
You do what you're supposed to do.

198
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,857
You hide that money just like we agreed,
and you just wait.

199
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,321
That's all you do. You just wait...

200
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,075
if you ever want to see your big brother
alive again. Do you understand me?

201
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,073
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,158
And you, you listen, too.

203
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,705
You betray us...

204
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,626
You betray us even with a look,
and as sure as there's a Devil in Hell...

205
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,751
either me, or Brownie, or Struther,
or one of our friends...

206
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,797
of which there are many, will kill that boy.

207
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,339
We know what to do with betrayers...

208
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,471
and we'll kill him for sure.

209
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,012
You hear me?

210
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,303
Say it!

211
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,144
I hear!

212
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,859
Now get inside!

213
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,975
- Marshal.
- Albert.

214
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,818
- I sure am glad you're back.
- I'm glad to be back.

215
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,114
There's three more of them in there.
One of them needs Dr. Jones real bad.

216
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,909
I'd appreciate it if you'd see to him
and the horses.

217
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,947
- Yes, sir. Marshal, I wanted to...
- And Tom Howard.

218
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,157
- The undertaker?
- I got a couple of customers for him, too.

219
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,791
But, Marshal, i wanted to...

220
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,283
Tell that old bandit not to get extravagant.

221
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,371
The State of Texas is paying for this.

222
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,958
Yes, but, Marshal...

223
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,421
Albert, have you heard one word i've said?

224
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,131
Yes, but I wanted to tell you
about Sheriff Grady.

225
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,055
- Tell me later.
- But you haven't...

226
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,607
It's the marshal.

227
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,291
Hank?

228
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,176
No way to run a jail.

229
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,800
Be my guest.

230
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,062
- J.D., these handcuffs...
- Get used to them.

231
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,446
Charlie...

232
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,028
what are you doing in here?
It ain't Thursday.

233
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,822
A man's got a right to change his mind.

234
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,617
Besides, it's gonna rain on Thursday.

235
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,699
Now, drinking in the rain...

236
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,826
it's bad for your health.

237
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,334
It's getting so a man
can't get a decent night's sleep...

238
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,548
without some marshal...

239
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,503
All right, Struther, you can come out
from under that Stetson.

240
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,008
What is it this time?

241
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,471
Hope you haven't been stealing
any more horses...

242
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,181
No, J.D., i'm hung over something terrible.

243
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,310
I can't hardly remember a thing.

244
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,857
You can't...

245
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,607
Daniel?

246
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,895
Daniel.

247
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,239
What the hell is he doing in here?

248
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,661
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Yeah! Drinking and fighting.

249
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,702
With them.

250
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,547
Looks like you were kind of overmatched.

251
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,837
It was a friendly fight.

252
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,589
I've never been in one of them.

253
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,390
What are you doing in town, you...

254
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,353
Come here.

255
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,981
All right. I know where you are.

256
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,900
Where's your kid brother?

257
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,403
He's around.

258
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,650
Around?

259
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,738
Isn't he going to school?

260
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,120
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes?

261
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,951
How's he gonna get a proper education
going to school "sometimes"?

262
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,497
Instead of raising Ned, you ought
to be raising that brother of yours.

263
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,426
Ain't you got no sense of responsibility?

264
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,967
Your mother, God rest her soul...

265
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,676
seen to it you could read and write...

266
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,593
could do your ciphers proper.

267
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,436
The least you could do
is the same for your kid brother.

268
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,552
Why?

269
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,726
Why?

270
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,982
I ain't his pa.

271
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,404
Yeah.

272
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,247
Marshal, you should have seen...

273
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,792
You're fired.

274
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,421
Billy Joe.

275
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,339
Where you going?

276
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,760
Come here.

277
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,638
Hello, Budger.

278
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,726
Hello, Pa.

279
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,693
You're bleeding again.

280
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,645
Yeah.

281
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,361
Seems like every time you show up,
you been bleeding.

282
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,565
Yeah.

283
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:46,787
Only sometimes it's hard to remember
when the last time you showed up was.

284
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,325
I'll admit it's been a while.

285
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,833
J.D.

286
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,997
Hello, Hank. You have a good rest?

287
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,585
Where did you come from?

288
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,633
Where the hell is Grady?

289
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,587
What's the matter?
Did i say something wrong?

290
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:07,554
Come on, Hank, if Grady's drunk,
it won't be the first time.

291
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,226
Grady's been killed, J.D.

292
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,266
For the first time.

293
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,047
Marshal, good to see you, but I...

294
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,375
Any luck?

295
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,710
No, sir.

296
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,172
I brought you a couple of guests.

297
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,092
The sheriff from Dawson City
will pick them up in a day or so.

298
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,592
I'm awfully sorry about Sheriff Grady.
I know he was a friend of yours.

299
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,800
Yeah.

300
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,521
I'm not gonna...

301
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,440
mourn for him.

302
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,644
He lived a good life.

303
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,948
Guess there's no good way to die, so...

304
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,746
Tell me what happened.

305
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,241
Pretty sketchy.

306
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,164
All Kane said before he died was,
"Four men wearing yellow slickers."

307
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:18,704
Grady got shotgunned,
and I pulled a knife out of Jim Kane.

308
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,670
They broke in the back door of the bank
with sledgehammers.

309
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,836
We rode a 30-mile circumference...

310
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,301
with a 20-man posse,
including two Apaches.

311
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,552
No tracks.

312
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,761
That's impossible,
unless they're still in town.

313
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,011
No, sir, Mr. Cahill. No strangers.

314
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,430
Some local ranchers, some cowboys...

315
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,893
maybe not as sweet as scrubbed angels...

316
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,112
but in public view when it happened,
no strangers.

317
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,991
How about them?

318
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,317
They was in jail when it happened.

319
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,154
That right, Daniel?

320
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,283
That's right.

321
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,282
Pity.

322
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,622
Mr. Gordine,
when will you let us out of here?

323
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,123
Drunk and disorderly
is usually about 24 hours.

324
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,092
I guess now is a good a time as any.

325
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,551
I'm gonna make a little trip.
Take a day or two.

326
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,513
Will you hold them till I get back?

327
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,639
I can't do that, Marshal.

328
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,007
No cause.

329
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:14,969
Suit yourself.

330
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,309
Daniel.

331
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,098
- Yes, sir.
- Gonna deputize you.

332
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,391
No pay.

333
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,976
That figures.

334
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,028
Hold up your right hand.

335
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,991
Do you swear to uphold the law
of Baird, Texas...

336
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,702
United States of America?

337
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,169
And I ain't gonna forget
your taking care of Billy Joe, either.

338
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,126
He's a lot younger than my other boarders.

339
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,708
But it'll be nice to have
a young boy around again.

340
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,510
I sure appreciate it.

341
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:52,388
And if he stays, it'll be the first Cahill
I've been able to keep under my roof.

342
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,937
If he causes you any trouble,
you just sit right down on him.

343
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,481
And as for you, Billy Joe...

344
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,558
What the hell are you whispering about?

345
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,023
Don't you know
that whispering ain't polite...

346
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,437
except in church, or a courtroom?

347
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,446
What he's saying ain't private, Pa.

348
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:11,067
Billy Joe was thinking you ought
to let the doctor see your shoulder.

349
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,368
It's been took care of, bandaged, and...

350
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,911
- By whom, J.D.?
- By what?

351
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,079
Whom?

352
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,872
That's the correct way of asking
who done it.

353
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,242
I took care of it.

354
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,963
Purified it with whiskey.

355
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,420
Yeah, a quart and a half. He drunk it.

356
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,624
You're scared.

357
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,960
You're scared of Dr. Jones is what you are.

358
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,379
They say the last time
you was in his office...

359
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,143
they could hear you yelling
from Austin to El Paso.

360
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,266
- Get the horses.
- Billy Joe's right.

361
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,142
They say he's hit notes
music publishers ain't heard.

362
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,105
Get the horses, Daniel.

363
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,609
Austin to El Paso?

364
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,438
Thought I yelled louder than that.

365
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,647
Hetty.

366
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,112
Goodbye.

367
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,630
Come on. Let's go in.

368
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,478
Where are we going?

369
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,349
First we'll pick ourselves up a tracker.

370
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,227
That 'breed Comanche
over by the Goldicks' place?

371
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,153
The one thing i hate
more than a Comanche is half of one.

372
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,862
His name is Lightfoot.

373
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,984
I wouldn't call him 'breed to his face,
were i you.

374
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,531
Not if you want to reach maturity.

375
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,996
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

376
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,515
Didn't take that Struther long
to make new friends.

377
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,369
Papa, a stranger's coming.

378
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,041
I see him.

379
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,972
Good morning, my dear Chief.

380
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,729
I hope all goes well in your lives.

381
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,029
How about a cigar?

382
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,273
Chief?

383
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,566
Cigar?

384
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,702
What the hell do you want, J.D.?

385
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,200
I ain't got no money.

386
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,330
My horse is on his last legs.

387
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:07,953
And my genuine bearskin overcoat,
I lost in a crap game.

388
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,581
Need a tracker, Lightfoot.

389
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,253
That's better.

390
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,135
How long would you say?

391
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,094
Two days, maybe three.

392
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:18,927
It's...

393
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,055
cold up in them mountains.

394
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,436
That's a fact.

395
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,640
First day, $5.

396
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,725
$2 a day thereafter.

397
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,438
That's agreeable.

398
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,642
I'll track.

399
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,112
Any killing, you do it.

400
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,774
Might be friends of mine.

401
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,489
That's suitable.

402
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,065
Ma'am.

403
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,452
Morning, gentlemen.

404
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,199
Daniel.

405
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,823
I don't tip my hat to a squaw.

406
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,119
Ain't no squaw's gonna...

407
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,214
My apologies, ma'am.

408
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,956
Slight negligence in his upbringing.

409
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,153
Ma'am?

410
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,614
What you bringing us up here for?

411
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:06,951
Don't you know?

412
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,665
If i knowed i wouldn't ask.

413
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,660
What are you walking on?

414
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,462
Rock face.

415
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,539
That's right, rock face.

416
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:18,831
Starts back there out of Valentine,
climbs all the way up...

417
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,552
to Heaven, so the...

418
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,382
Comanches say.

419
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,095
Now, nobody just disappears, Daniel.

420
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,430
If the men that killed Ben Grady
ain't in town...

421
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,062
and didn't leave tracks
that two Apaches could read...

422
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,475
then they're up here somewhere.

423
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,894
And if they are, I'll find them.

424
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,774
Yes, sir, Daniel.

425
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,736
That's the truth you can bank on
in Denver.

426
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,945
If they're up here...

427
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,573
I'll find them.

428
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,657
Been smelling smoke.

429
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,449
Half a mile down the ridge.

430
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,815
How many?

431
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,113
Hired on as a tracker.

432
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,462
Stay here, Daniel.

433
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,207
I'll have a look.

434
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,663
Something on your mind?

435
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,374
Just thinking...

436
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,577
if you wasn't J.D. 's boy,
what a good time i'd have right now.

437
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,083
What I'd like to do to you
brings back fond memories.

438
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,336
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,090
I don't like you.

440
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,470
That's what i'm talking about.

441
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,226
Let me tell you something, half-breed.

442
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:41,900
- I don't care what you have to say about...
- You don't care about anything.

443
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,442
The difference between you
and J.D. Cahill.

444
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,570
Even them that hates him,
admire him for that.

445
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,032
He cares.

446
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,000
He doesn't care about Billy Joe and me.

447
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:04,335
Kid, i've had buffalo brains
that's got more going for them than you.

448
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:08,877
You got a bad feeling about your pa
'cause he ain't home every night...

449
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,179
to powder your butt and tuck you in.

450
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,888
What business is it of yours, anyway?

451
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,013
I've ridden with him.

452
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,056
And i've sweat with him.

453
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,141
And i've froze with him.

454
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,733
And i've tracked for him.

455
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,812
And i've cooked for him.

456
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,902
And i've covered
even two dozen gunfights...

457
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,486
Here he comes.

458
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,906
And what's more...

459
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:38,624
I've set near about every bone in his body
that's decent enough to talk about.

460
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,373
They're out there, all right,
camped in the shelter of some trees.

461
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:47,797
Daniel...

462
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,208
get your rifle.

463
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,763
You taking him with you?

464
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:51,927
Yeah.

465
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,214
J. D...

466
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,260
give me my $5.

467
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:58,093
You get shot tonight, I disappear.

468
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,306
I'll come back and bury you.

469
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:03,435
Mumble something Christian
over your grave.

470
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,439
Lightfoot, your kindness overwhelms me.

471
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,109
It might not be them out there, Pa.

472
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,367
Let's go ask them.

473
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,427
- The fire's dying out.
- Let it.

474
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,687
I'd think a long time
before I did anything rash.

475
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,826
Cahill.

476
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,541
United States Marshal.

477
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,380
- Pa!
- Hold it!

478
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:14,298
Mister, I ain't got a bigoted bone
in my body.

479
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:16,175
You don't drop that axe...

480
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,718
I'll blast you to Hell
as quick as I would a white man.

481
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:28,855
Come on in.

482
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,034
All right. Let's get rid of the hardware.

483
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:38,485
Boy.

484
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,947
I ain't got no knife, mister.

485
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,121
Friend...

486
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:52,922
you look like a hideaway man to me.

487
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:54,502
What is it?

488
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,554
Derringer or a palm gun?

489
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,810
Lightfoot.

490
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,014
Yeah?

491
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,733
Are they friends of yours?

492
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,899
Nope.

493
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:13,398
You know them at all?

494
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,481
Nope.

495
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,443
Daniel?

496
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,040
I don't know them.

497
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:26,287
That ought to do about as much damage
to a bank door as a sledgehammer.

498
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,418
Wouldn't you say, Daniel?

499
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:44,312
New money.

500
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:57,282
Where'd you get it?

501
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:01,780
Where'd you get it?

502
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,956
Don't, Pa!

503
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,375
Ben Grady leaves a wife
and two little boys.

504
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,789
I asked you a question.

505
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,502
You may gather i'm a little impatient.

506
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,673
Where'd you get that money?

507
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,881
We took it from a Mormon drover
in New Mexico.

508
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,802
We had a lot less than we needed...

509
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:23,801
and he had a lot more than he needed.

510
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,136
Mormon drover in New Mexico?

511
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,719
Yes, sir.

512
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,224
That's the God's truth.

513
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,485
How old are you, boy?

514
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,772
He's 16.

515
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,777
Just turned 16, is all.

516
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,656
Belong to you?

517
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,157
My grandson.

518
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,338
Mister, you ain't gonna put those on me.

519
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:58,510
- Daniel, get their horses.
- You ain't going to!

520
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:00,802
Either that or i'll kill you.

521
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:08,096
I don't think they did it, Pa.

522
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:10,810
That's for the jury to say, not me.

523
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:13,351
I don't think they did it.

524
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:21,201
Son, if you know something I don't...

525
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,693
I'd be obliged to hear about it.

526
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,407
Otherwise, go get their horses.

527
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:57,986
- Five pounds of tea.
- Golden tips, ma'am?

528
00:44:58,072 --> 00:45:00,907
No, Oongal or Black Oolong, Mr. Campbell.

529
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:05,484
And a 140-pound sack
of Ceylon java coffee.

530
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:11,289
Five pounds of Wilbur's Breakfast Cocoa.

531
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:14,667
One pound of black pepper.

532
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,997
Five pounds of mustard powder.

533
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:21,587
And three quarts
of medicinal blackberry brandy.

534
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:27,303
Look who's got his nose in the candy.

535
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,062
He can have two.

536
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:36,484
There's two...

537
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:40,819
and two more for good luck, Billy Joe.

538
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,281
Thank you!

539
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:46,489
And six two-pound tins of plum pudding.

540
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:49,955
And i want...
Now, Billy Joe, put that down.

541
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,575
- That's much too heavy for you.
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

542
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,753
And...

543
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:02,249
a dozen Crosse & Blackwell mixed jerky.

544
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,416
The money wasn't
where it was supposed to be.

545
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,713
It wasn't where we told you to put it.

546
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,262
And we looked, but it just wasn't there.

547
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,843
We is some disappointed in you, boy.

548
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:56,270
Struther practically being a father to you,
and all.

549
00:46:57,107 --> 00:47:00,441
And him taking your betrayal of us
real personally...

550
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:04,522
he wanted to come into town
and cut you up real bad.

551
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:06,946
But i told him that wasn't necessary.

552
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:09,323
There must be
some kind of misunderstanding...

553
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,404
cause you is a good boy.

554
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:14,123
A good boy...

555
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,749
who wouldn't betray his friends.

556
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:21,704
No, sir. I just wouldn't believe
that you'd do anything so...

557
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:24,754
foolish.

558
00:47:26,387 --> 00:47:28,046
Where's the money?

559
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,671
Struther.

560
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:37,146
Where's the money?

561
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:40,227
- I hid it.
- Where? You hid it where?

562
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,563
I ain't telling. I ain't.

563
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:47,572
Why in the hell not, you little son of a...

564
00:47:48,951 --> 00:47:51,786
Why not?
Would you explain it to me, please?

565
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,322
Because me and mine
don't like to be threatened...

566
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,657
and chased and told what to do.

567
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:04,005
If you kill me,
you ain't never gonna find that money.

568
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,253
Never!

569
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,672
Pick him up. We gotta take him
where nobody will hear him scream.

570
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:13,758
- Come here.
- Let me down!

571
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,428
- Damn you.
- Get him!

572
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:27,439
Watch out! Damn wire!

573
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:50,085
Where the hell did he get to?

574
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,168
Trouble, J.D.

575
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:30,337
I see them.

576
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:35,722
They look nasty, Pa.

577
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,179
Yeah.

578
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:40,682
Friends of Ben Grady, I guess.

579
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,136
Yeah.

580
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:43,767
There's that.

581
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,059
But mostly, it's money.

582
00:49:46,944 --> 00:49:49,898
Bank gets robbed, town goes broke.

583
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:54,231
Most people think
all that money belongs to the bankers.

584
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:56,315
It don't.

585
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,613
It's the little folks' savings.

586
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:00,289
What about us?

587
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,281
Yeah.

588
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,037
What about you?

589
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:26,890
We'll take them from here on, J.D.

590
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,609
Just like that?

591
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:30,778
Just like that.

592
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:34,239
Lightfoot, how far away
would you say they are?

593
00:50:34,324 --> 00:50:36,401
About 10, 12 feet.

594
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,580
Make a good pattern for this buckshot.

595
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,453
There's no use potting around.

596
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:44,830
I'm willing to die trying to keep them.

597
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:48,168
The question is, are you willing to die
trying to take them?

598
00:50:57,598 --> 00:50:59,923
Now, I'm cold and hungry, and...

599
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:02,931
wet and tired and short-tempered.

600
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:05,020
So get on with it.

601
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:11,233
Hell, get out of my way!

602
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:43,643
- J.D.!
- Hank.

603
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:48,226
Your littlest boy's come down
with something.

604
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,020
Bad?

605
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:52,317
That's the word.

606
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:54,690
Cock it.

607
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,739
Howdy.

608
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:21,171
Go on, I'll take care of it.

609
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:35,811
Where is he?

610
00:52:35,904 --> 00:52:38,360
- He's in with the doctor, J.D.
- Which room?

611
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:42,197
The doctor doesn't want anybody in there
until he's finished with the boy.

612
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:45,027
Now, you can just wait right here.

613
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:50,205
Women.

614
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:00,250
Things seem to happen to you two
when I'm...

615
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:01,669
not around.

616
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,634
Like the time Gordine's horse kicked you...

617
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:06,552
- And broke your leg...
- Pa?

618
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:08,387
And the time Billy Joe...

619
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,970
- Got poison ivy all over his face and...
- Pa?

620
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:14,976
You ain't never around.

621
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,946
You're dead right, Daniel.
I can't argue that.

622
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:25,991
I've been gone a lot of times
when you kids really needed me.

623
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:29,954
And I've missed a lot, too.

624
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:33,540
Missed watching you two grow up.

625
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:37,172
I think about it a lot...

626
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:38,793
on every job...

627
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:41,174
about how, when it's over...

628
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:45,129
I'll come home and the three of us
will get to know one another.

629
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:48,643
But even before that job was finished...

630
00:53:49,186 --> 00:53:51,428
another one always seemed...

631
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:52,719
to crop up.

632
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:56,811
Another bank robbed, another murder.

633
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:02,896
I don't want what I'm saying
to sound like I'm making excuses.

634
00:54:03,492 --> 00:54:05,947
There's no excuse for negligence.

635
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:10,494
No excuse for a man ignoring his...

636
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,833
duty, either.

637
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:15,666
Your mother...

638
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:17,379
God bless her...

639
00:54:18,424 --> 00:54:20,250
when she was dying...

640
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:24,048
the last thing she said on earth was:

641
00:54:25,055 --> 00:54:26,763
"Go get them, J.D."

642
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:29,849
And I've been going...

643
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:33,470
and getting them ever since...

644
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:37,645
till it's no longer just my job.

645
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,694
It's part of my life.

646
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:45,899
And that's what I want you
to try and understand, Son.

647
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:48,696
Your old man's life.

648
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:52,156
Will you give it a try?

649
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:55,707
Yeah, Pa. I'll try.

650
00:54:56,754 --> 00:54:58,129
I'm glad...

651
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,752
'cause even grown men
need understanding.

652
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,259
I'll be by tomorrow, Billy Joe.

653
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:08,844
Doc.

654
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:12,260
He has a high fever, J.D.

655
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:13,633
How high?

656
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:15,224
A hundred and three.

657
00:55:15,314 --> 00:55:18,599
- A hundred and three...
- But it's not climbing, it's leveled off.

658
00:55:19,777 --> 00:55:21,686
The boy has a touch of pneumonia.

659
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:24,270
- Just pneumonia?
- But he's young.

660
00:55:24,698 --> 00:55:26,856
Proper bed rest, good care...

661
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,314
he'll be as good as new.

662
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,655
You sure, Doc?

663
00:55:29,745 --> 00:55:32,948
I'd bet my brand-new, Chicago-made...

664
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,831
leg amputator on it.

665
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,244
He's worried about one thing, though.

666
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:38,415
What's that?

667
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:39,749
Your shoulder.

668
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:41,914
He wants me to take a look at it.

669
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:43,086
Forget it.

670
00:55:43,175 --> 00:55:44,338
Thanks, Doc.

671
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:47,131
- Can we...
- Go right ahead.

672
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:56,229
Hello, Budger.

673
00:55:57,189 --> 00:55:58,600
How are you?

674
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,608
I'm all right, Pa.

675
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:03,444
Sure you're all right, you're a Cahill.

676
00:56:03,904 --> 00:56:07,439
Cahills have survived floods,
earthquakes, pestilence...

677
00:56:07,616 --> 00:56:11,067
every natural disaster known to man.
Not to mention...

678
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:13,495
a few unnatural ones.

679
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,541
Can I get you anything?
You hungry or thirsty?

680
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:18,741
No.

681
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:22,085
I'm just a little tired, Pa.

682
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,831
All right, Son. You get some sleep.

683
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,754
Get some rest.

684
00:56:28,762 --> 00:56:31,134
When you get back on your feet...

685
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:32,801
me and you and...

686
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,635
old Daniel there...

687
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:37,802
gonna get to know each other better.

688
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:41,641
- It sounds like a promise.
- You can believe it, Son.

689
00:56:45,404 --> 00:56:47,064
- Pa?
- Yes.

690
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:51,982
You never told me a promise before.

691
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:56,869
No...

692
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,958
I guess I never.

693
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:05,673
Hetty, I...

694
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:08,627
I'll be back.

695
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:11,253
I gotta check on some prisoners.

696
00:57:21,774 --> 00:57:23,647
I'll sit with him now.

697
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:28,686
You look done in yourself, Daniel.

698
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:29,979
No.

699
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,032
Only on the outside.

700
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:50,758
Tried to kill me, Danny.

701
00:57:51,178 --> 00:57:53,550
I hid the money
and wouldn't tell him where...

702
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:56,426
because I thought
we might wanna give it back.

703
00:57:56,558 --> 00:58:00,093
And they tried to kill me.
I been afeard to sleep, Danny.

704
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:03,060
You go to sleep, Billy Joe Cahill.

705
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:05,058
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

706
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,704
- Danny!
- Sit down!

707
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,873
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time, boy.

708
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,712
- And if you don't answer...
- Close the window.

709
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:09,623
- What'd you say?
- Close the window.

710
00:59:09,715 --> 00:59:12,288
My brother's sick.
You want him to catch his death?

711
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:27,599
Where's the money?

712
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,186
We killed two men to get it.
You gotta understand, boy...

713
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:34,777
we ain't gonna hang any longer
or be any deader if we kill two more.

714
00:59:34,865 --> 00:59:36,240
Where's our money?

715
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:39,987
Tell him, Billy Joe.

716
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:43,994
Let him have the money and get.
We'll give ourselves up and confess.

717
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,118
I never meant for four innocent men
to hang for something I did, anyway.

718
00:59:53,842 --> 00:59:55,634
Tell him, Billy Joe.

719
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:00,760
I can't.

720
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:03,263
You don't believe I'll kill you?

721
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:06,520
It was pitch-dark.

722
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:09,013
And I was scared near outta my pants.

723
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:11,599
I went this way and that way, and...

724
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,517
well...

725
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:15,570
I know where it is.

726
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:19,024
But I can't tell you where it is.

727
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:22,451
I kinda have to find it again,
if you can understand?

728
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:27,959
Get him dressed.

729
01:00:28,043 --> 01:00:30,332
- He's got pneumonia.
- I don't give a...

730
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:32,911
- What'd you say?
- I said, he's got pneumonia.

731
01:00:33,006 --> 01:00:36,707
Even if you kill me and take him,
he won't live an hour out in that rain.

732
01:00:46,854 --> 01:00:49,261
When did the doctor say
he'd be on his feet again?

733
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:50,731
Didn't say.

734
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,815
When he is, you know where we'll be.

735
01:00:56,488 --> 01:00:57,567
Yeah.

736
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:13,374
You swear.

737
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,135
You swear on your brother's life
and on his everlasting spirit...

738
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:23,264
may it rot in Hell for time eternal
if you break your oath to me.

739
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:27,931
You swear you'll bring that money to me
within a fortnight.

740
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,186
And that you won't tell anybody,
anybody at all...

741
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:32,851
about what you've done.

742
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,773
Or what we done before you.

743
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,101
Swear it.

744
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:44,483
I swear.

745
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,206
On your brother's life and eternal spirit.

746
01:01:49,249 --> 01:01:51,954
On my brother's life and eternal spirit.

747
01:02:22,241 --> 01:02:23,652
Funny thing.

748
01:02:25,035 --> 01:02:27,277
I keep thinking about my mama.

749
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:29,660
She said I was born to be hung.

750
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:33,952
But to be hung for something I didn't do.

751
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:37,087
Of all the bad things I've done.

752
01:02:37,172 --> 01:02:40,173
I killed my first man
when I was 12 years old.

753
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,044
Now to be hung...

754
01:02:44,555 --> 01:02:47,840
- You know who's going to do it?
- That kid, I guess.

755
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:50,177
He's acting sheriff.

756
01:02:51,603 --> 01:02:54,094
Sure hope he knows what he's doing.

757
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:56,854
I seen a man choke-hung once.

758
01:02:57,943 --> 01:03:00,149
Didn't break his neck proper.

759
01:03:00,487 --> 01:03:03,488
It was five minutes
before he stopped kicking.

760
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:06,199
Did they shoot him?

761
01:03:06,702 --> 01:03:07,900
No.

762
01:03:08,412 --> 01:03:11,033
It wasn't a lynching, you understand.

763
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:13,912
It was a legal, proper hanging.

764
01:03:14,543 --> 01:03:17,579
And they don't shoot you
at legal, proper hangings.

765
01:03:17,963 --> 01:03:19,505
Dirty bastards.

766
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:25,344
Good morning.

767
01:03:43,572 --> 01:03:45,399
There's some makings.

768
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:50,407
- You the one that chews?
- Yes, sir.

769
01:03:53,665 --> 01:03:55,243
Thank you kindly.

770
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:57,208
They made up their minds yet?

771
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:02,249
Wednesday morning.

772
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:10,176
Two days.

773
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:22,938
Marshal?

774
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:28,108
This damn animal...

775
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:30,110
keeps taking in air.

776
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:33,449
Looks pretty grim
for them fellows in there.

777
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:34,618
Yeah.

778
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:37,411
Mr. Cahill, you think they did it?

779
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:41,254
Jury said they did. Judge sentenced them.

780
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:44,381
What I'm asking is,
do you think they did it?

781
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:48,668
I think they're guilty as hell...

782
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:51,805
of robbing a Mormon drover
in New Mexico.

783
01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:55,053
And I gotta hang them.

784
01:04:57,729 --> 01:04:59,473
Goes with the badge.

785
01:05:16,874 --> 01:05:20,741
Anytime you boys want to come back,
you're welcome, and don't you forget that.

786
01:05:20,836 --> 01:05:24,252
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thanks for taking care of me, too.

787
01:05:24,339 --> 01:05:26,961
I was glad to do anything I could, Billy Joe.

788
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:29,339
You kinda like our pa, don't you?

789
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:32,093
Now, what makes you say that?

790
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,506
You look at him funny sometimes.

791
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:37,642
Maybe there's a lot of words
being spoke inside your head...

792
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:39,720
that nobody can hear except you.

793
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:43,348
Billy Joe, I'll talk to you
about that in 10 or 15 years.

794
01:05:47,238 --> 01:05:49,526
That sound gives me the shivers.

795
01:05:49,781 --> 01:05:53,233
I wonder what it's doing
to those who're waiting for it.

796
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,244
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.

797
01:05:57,706 --> 01:05:58,737
Bye.

798
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:38,171
Things didn't work out
like we planned, did they, Danny?

799
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:40,677
No, they didn't.

800
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:45,895
And I ain't blaming
that no-good Struther, neither.

801
01:07:46,565 --> 01:07:50,812
It was like the Lord and the Devil
was having a tug of war in my gut.

802
01:07:51,236 --> 01:07:52,730
The Devil won.

803
01:07:53,614 --> 01:07:55,986
Seems like the Devil always wins.

804
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:59,487
Maybe that's why so many people
are on his side.

805
01:07:59,578 --> 01:08:00,657
Yeah.

806
01:08:00,871 --> 01:08:02,614
But I ain't really.

807
01:08:03,332 --> 01:08:06,333
I just wanted to get back at Pa
for never being around.

808
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:08,292
Pa ain't so bad, Danny.

809
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:12,122
Let's tell him about the whole thing
and be done with it.

810
01:08:12,633 --> 01:08:13,878
We can't.

811
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:17,340
Figure we don't know him
well enough yet?

812
01:08:17,805 --> 01:08:19,465
No, that ain't it.

813
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:24,009
If Pa gets himself into something,
he gets himself out.

814
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:26,267
And that's what we gotta do.

815
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:30,774
Get ourselves out
without Fraser killing us.

816
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:35,687
Sure is hard, acting like a man.

817
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:43,319
- Almost didn't find you.
- Hell, J. D...

818
01:08:43,414 --> 01:08:45,406
I left a trail a blind man could follow.

819
01:08:45,499 --> 01:08:47,077
- They didn't go home?
- Nope.

820
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,374
- Where are they?
- Right there.

821
01:08:50,545 --> 01:08:53,037
- What are they doing?
- Just sitting.

822
01:08:54,258 --> 01:08:56,500
- They pick up the money?
- Nope.

823
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:01,050
Fishing.

824
01:09:01,723 --> 01:09:03,716
Just sitting and fishing.

825
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:07,228
Four men are gonna hang
for something they didn't do...

826
01:09:07,312 --> 01:09:09,886
and they're just sitting and fishing.

827
01:09:27,124 --> 01:09:28,618
There they go.

828
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,080
Lightfoot.

829
01:09:32,588 --> 01:09:35,209
Amy and me tried for a lot of years...

830
01:09:35,924 --> 01:09:37,584
to have children.

831
01:09:38,135 --> 01:09:39,297
But...

832
01:09:40,429 --> 01:09:43,264
maybe they came along too late in my life.

833
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:47,555
- Yeah?
- There ain't nothing too late...

834
01:09:48,437 --> 01:09:49,979
if you love it.

835
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:25,094
Danny!

836
01:10:25,891 --> 01:10:27,136
I'm here.

837
01:10:58,173 --> 01:10:59,288
Here.

838
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,305
Come on.

839
01:11:28,788 --> 01:11:30,032
Come on.

840
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:42,921
Where'd you bury it, Billy Joe?

841
01:11:44,511 --> 01:11:47,429
It was pitch-black. I didn't have a lantern.

842
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:48,712
I...

843
01:11:49,975 --> 01:11:51,718
can't quite remember.

844
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,023
There.

845
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,851
Hold this.

846
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:19,494
You're making enough noise
to wake the dead.

847
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:22,126
It wouldn't hurt
to be a little quiet and careful.

848
01:12:22,215 --> 01:12:23,330
For what?

849
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:25,714
To take candy away from babies?

850
01:12:30,933 --> 01:12:33,554
Why do you suppose
they wouldn't tell me?

851
01:12:33,644 --> 01:12:36,728
Didn't they know
if they confided in me, I'd...

852
01:12:38,315 --> 01:12:40,189
Give them a chance, J.D.

853
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:43,276
Probably got it worked out
in some kids' way.

854
01:12:43,362 --> 01:12:44,441
Kids?

855
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:46,030
Bank robbers.

856
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,163
God!

857
01:12:58,251 --> 01:13:00,624
Some poor soul leaving his mortal body.

858
01:13:00,712 --> 01:13:04,295
- I knowed! I know it!
- I think it's just an old hoot owl.

859
01:13:06,343 --> 01:13:07,624
You sure?

860
01:13:08,679 --> 01:13:09,793
Nope.

861
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:21,480
Did you see them bank robbers
jump out of their pants...

862
01:13:21,775 --> 01:13:23,317
when that old owl hooted?

863
01:13:23,402 --> 01:13:27,270
I am now gonna give them a scare
they ain't never gonna forget.

864
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:31,487
While their pants are down,
I'll give them a little parental guidance.

865
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:37,990
- Found something?
- I hope it's the right something.

866
01:13:41,378 --> 01:13:43,417
- They got the money.
- Yeah.

867
01:13:46,884 --> 01:13:48,128
Come on.

868
01:14:24,963 --> 01:14:26,541
Holy Christmas!

869
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:29,885
Like taking candy away from babies?

870
01:14:30,219 --> 01:14:31,547
Very funny.

871
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:38,056
I'll tell you something funnier.

872
01:14:38,185 --> 01:14:40,391
- What's that?
- My leg's broke.

873
01:14:47,611 --> 01:14:50,778
We're gonna have to straighten it
and splint it.

874
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,733
I thought an Indian didn't show pain.

875
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,365
Especially a bona fide
Comanche war chief.

876
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:04,917
Who in the hell ever told you that,
a damn white man?

877
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:09,256
This is gonna hurt.
Here's something to bite on.

878
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:11,836
Thank you, J.D.

879
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,112
This knothead of yours...

880
01:15:40,456 --> 01:15:42,947
almost ran my butt into the ground.

881
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:45,166
Couldn't find mine.

882
01:15:45,294 --> 01:15:47,452
Must've headed for the barn.

883
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:52,291
I hope you're enjoying my cigar.

884
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:54,797
Not bad.

885
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:57,132
How's the leg?

886
01:15:57,348 --> 01:16:00,930
If you're asking me as a war chief
of the Comanche nation...

887
01:16:01,018 --> 01:16:02,809
I don't feel a thing.

888
01:16:03,228 --> 01:16:06,847
If you're asking the white part of me,
it hurts like hell.

889
01:16:10,277 --> 01:16:14,109
- That's the white man groaning, I take it?
- You're damn right.

890
01:16:26,543 --> 01:16:29,295
I'll need that bottle of whiskey you've got.

891
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:33,713
When you're finished with this thing,
if you should come out alive...

892
01:16:33,801 --> 01:16:36,505
you can come
and do some hunting for me.

893
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:38,801
I'll be stove up all spring.

894
01:16:42,893 --> 01:16:46,013
Yeah. You might bring
a box of them cigars, too.

895
01:16:46,104 --> 01:16:48,014
You ain't finished yet.

896
01:16:48,648 --> 01:16:50,855
- Ain't finished?
- That's right.

897
01:16:51,193 --> 01:16:54,063
What the hell are you talking about?
My leg's broke.

898
01:16:54,154 --> 01:16:56,360
I'm going home. That's what I'm gonna do.

899
01:16:56,448 --> 01:16:59,615
- No, you ain't. You're gonna finish the job.
- Why?

900
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:02,611
Because you're a better tracker than I am.

901
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:05,077
And there's no time for mistakes.

902
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,076
So start tracking.

903
01:18:32,752 --> 01:18:34,875
You just stay where you are.

904
01:18:35,338 --> 01:18:37,378
MacDonald, this is Cahill.

905
01:18:38,175 --> 01:18:39,586
How are you?

906
01:18:39,843 --> 01:18:40,958
Fine.

907
01:18:41,387 --> 01:18:44,506
Leastwise, ain't no one tried
to hang me lately.

908
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:50,009
Well?

909
01:18:50,604 --> 01:18:52,229
There's the gate.

910
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,112
I'm in trouble.

911
01:19:01,156 --> 01:19:02,698
I need a horse.

912
01:19:05,077 --> 01:19:06,820
I'm willing to pay.

913
01:19:07,704 --> 01:19:09,329
In back of you.

914
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:10,577
Thanks.

915
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:13,870
That's no horse.

916
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:15,705
It's a horse.

917
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:20,084
Leastways, as much of a horse
as you'll find within 20 miles of here.

918
01:19:24,722 --> 01:19:27,841
I got an old McClellan.
I'll throw that in, $50.

919
01:19:28,434 --> 01:19:29,928
$50?

920
01:19:30,895 --> 01:19:32,638
You want them or not?

921
01:19:35,274 --> 01:19:36,602
Your feet.

922
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,362
Get the McClellan.

923
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:48,653
Stay with him, J.D.!

924
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:55,287
Stay with him!

925
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:03,298
Might be faster if you walked.

926
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:05,754
More comfortable, too.

927
01:20:06,096 --> 01:20:08,421
Seeing as we're in such a hurry.

928
01:20:11,185 --> 01:20:14,102
Of course, $50 ain't too much to pay for...

929
01:20:14,521 --> 01:20:17,095
a spirited, well-bred animal like that.

930
01:20:17,357 --> 01:20:18,769
Lightfoot...

931
01:20:18,984 --> 01:20:22,150
I never heard a bona fide war chief
talk so much.

932
01:20:47,638 --> 01:20:50,307
How much further you calculate, Danny?

933
01:20:50,474 --> 01:20:52,217
About an hour.

934
01:21:52,995 --> 01:21:54,240
Stay here, Billy Joe.

935
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:57,745
- No, sir, I can't...
- I said, you stay here, Billy Joe.

936
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,125
Fraser!

937
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,224
Abe Fraser!

938
01:23:33,804 --> 01:23:35,464
Nobody's in there.

939
01:23:36,015 --> 01:23:37,177
No...

940
01:23:38,142 --> 01:23:39,470
Billy Joe?

941
01:23:41,895 --> 01:23:44,517
You shouldn't oughta treat me like a baby.

942
01:23:44,606 --> 01:23:47,856
- I'm near 13 years old.
- You're only 11, and that's all you are!

943
01:23:47,943 --> 01:23:51,727
Eleven going on 12,
and you ain't grown no brains yet at all.

944
01:23:52,197 --> 01:23:53,941
That's your excuse.

945
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:55,487
I'm 17.

946
01:23:56,285 --> 01:24:00,531
I must've lost any brains I ever had
to get us into a mess like this.

947
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:07,456
Those men are gonna hang because of us.

948
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:10,413
I can't get it off my mind.

949
01:24:10,883 --> 01:24:14,085
If Fraser don't get here quick,
it'll be too late.

950
01:24:19,308 --> 01:24:23,306
You calculate that they'll kill us
if they can, don't you, Danny?

951
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,168
Don't like it.

952
01:24:48,253 --> 01:24:50,045
Don't like it at all.

953
01:24:50,964 --> 01:24:53,456
There ain't no easy way to do this.

954
01:24:55,677 --> 01:24:57,551
So let's go find out.

955
01:25:20,703 --> 01:25:21,782
Damn!

956
01:26:26,143 --> 01:26:27,472
Lightfoot!

957
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:51,747
Well, don't break out in tears.

958
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:56,340
You've seen dying men before, ain't you?

959
01:27:05,015 --> 01:27:06,557
I want a cigar.

960
01:27:08,936 --> 01:27:10,928
Won't do you much good...

961
01:27:11,188 --> 01:27:13,181
coughing the way you are.

962
01:27:13,732 --> 01:27:15,938
Won't do me no harm, neither.

963
01:27:42,636 --> 01:27:45,756
You don't have to worry about your family
while I'm alive.

964
01:27:45,848 --> 01:27:47,508
Hell, I know that.

965
01:27:51,103 --> 01:27:53,226
I always loved these things.

966
01:27:54,064 --> 01:27:56,057
Never could afford them.

967
01:29:10,224 --> 01:29:12,263
You got a nice bright fire.

968
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:13,762
Signal fire.

969
01:29:15,479 --> 01:29:18,563
Except there's nobody to signal to.
Ain't that right, Brownie?

970
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:21,056
I told you I took care of things.

971
01:29:22,486 --> 01:29:24,194
Where's your brother?

972
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:25,939
Where's Billy Joe?

973
01:29:26,991 --> 01:29:28,899
Right here, Mr. Fraser.

974
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:34,617
Boy, you better put that thing down.

975
01:29:34,832 --> 01:29:38,331
Billy Joe, that ain't necessary.
We're all friends here.

976
01:29:42,881 --> 01:29:45,004
Boy, this is old Abe Fraser.

977
01:29:45,718 --> 01:29:48,339
Danny, tell him that ain't necessary.

978
01:30:00,565 --> 01:30:02,688
There's your share of the money,
Mr. Fraser.

979
01:30:02,776 --> 01:30:04,982
Three-fifths. About $12,000.

980
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:08,983
That ain't right, Danny.

981
01:30:09,074 --> 01:30:12,360
The usual way, the proper way,
is for the leader to make the split.

982
01:30:12,452 --> 01:30:16,782
It all works out the same way
but one likes to observe the proprieties.

983
01:30:16,874 --> 01:30:18,368
You understand.

984
01:30:19,251 --> 01:30:22,702
- You got the rest of the money with you?
- No, we don't.

985
01:30:22,838 --> 01:30:24,712
That money's well hid.

986
01:30:25,048 --> 01:30:27,456
We didn't come here
to get our throats slit.

987
01:30:27,759 --> 01:30:29,752
You'd just best take your share and go.

988
01:30:29,845 --> 01:30:32,418
You're a hard case, ain't you,
just like your old man?

989
01:30:32,514 --> 01:30:33,759
No, I ain't!

990
01:30:33,849 --> 01:30:37,799
If it was him, he'd shoot you
while he had the chance. Right now.

991
01:30:38,729 --> 01:30:41,480
You'd best take that money
and get while you still can.

992
01:30:41,565 --> 01:30:42,763
No.

993
01:30:43,567 --> 01:30:44,942
No, I won't.

994
01:30:45,777 --> 01:30:46,856
You won't?

995
01:30:46,945 --> 01:30:49,519
Not till I've had my say
and cleared my name.

996
01:30:49,907 --> 01:30:50,938
Fraser!

997
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:53,405
We played fair and square with you.

998
01:30:53,494 --> 01:30:57,443
In spite of your youth and inexperience,
we agreed to share equally with you.

999
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,915
And we have.

1000
01:30:59,124 --> 01:31:01,248
You agree to that, don't you?

1001
01:31:04,338 --> 01:31:06,211
And you, Billy Joe...

1002
01:31:08,008 --> 01:31:11,377
who was it let you stay in bed
so you'd get well?

1003
01:31:12,847 --> 01:31:16,381
Of course we had some disagreement,
on account of you changing your mind.

1004
01:31:16,475 --> 01:31:17,637
Not us.

1005
01:31:19,186 --> 01:31:21,759
I was gonna invite you
to come to my sister's with us.

1006
01:31:21,855 --> 01:31:24,524
And take you under my wing, as it were.

1007
01:31:27,653 --> 01:31:29,941
But I see that ain't your wish. So I'll...

1008
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,773
say goodbye to you.

1009
01:31:33,617 --> 01:31:36,488
I offer you my hand in friendship
and in parting.

1010
01:31:36,578 --> 01:31:39,947
I sure hope you won't shame me
by refusing to take it.

1011
01:31:46,672 --> 01:31:48,463
Goodbye, Mr. Fraser.

1012
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,111
They'll be waiting for us,
won't they, Danny?

1013
01:32:52,196 --> 01:32:54,521
Better now than in the daylight.

1014
01:33:35,114 --> 01:33:36,145
Pa!

1015
01:33:38,075 --> 01:33:41,242
- Am I ever glad to see you.
- Still got the money?

1016
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:44,656
- Part of it.
- Fraser's taken his share already?

1017
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:46,947
Yes.

1018
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:48,661
Where's yours?

1019
01:33:49,253 --> 01:33:51,578
- We buried it. L...
- Go dig it up.

1020
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,998
Just back them up and go around it.

1021
01:33:58,429 --> 01:34:00,088
You ain't leaving?

1022
01:34:01,306 --> 01:34:04,094
Four innocent men
are gonna get hung in the morning.

1023
01:34:04,184 --> 01:34:06,224
I'm going back to stop it.

1024
01:34:09,481 --> 01:34:12,684
- Take Billy Joe with you.
- Just do as you're told.

1025
01:34:12,943 --> 01:34:16,442
Don't you understand?
They're gonna be there waiting for us!

1026
01:34:21,285 --> 01:34:22,695
J.D. Cahill.

1027
01:34:24,622 --> 01:34:26,780
Doesn't give a damn about us.

1028
01:34:29,584 --> 01:34:30,616
Back.

1029
01:35:43,617 --> 01:35:45,195
Danny, look out!

1030
01:36:06,724 --> 01:36:08,930
I gave you your chance.
You gotta give me that.

1031
01:36:09,017 --> 01:36:12,351
- I held out my hand in friendship and...
- In a pig's eye, you did.

1032
01:36:12,437 --> 01:36:14,976
You was gonna kill us
the first chance you got.

1033
01:36:15,065 --> 01:36:18,351
The trouble with you, boy,
is that you got no grace.

1034
01:36:18,568 --> 01:36:21,238
You should allow a man his illusions.

1035
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:32,327
Danny!

1036
01:36:42,176 --> 01:36:43,374
Fraser!

1037
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:10,779
Danny, are you dead?

1038
01:37:11,789 --> 01:37:13,865
Got the wind knocked out of me.

1039
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:17,291
Boy, you really had me scared,
lying there like that.

1040
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,088
- Give me that horse.
- We got the money.

1041
01:37:26,386 --> 01:37:27,631
I want him.

1042
01:37:27,721 --> 01:37:30,675
And I want them two boys,
and I want them bad.

1043
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,434
You staked us out, Pa.

1044
01:37:35,729 --> 01:37:38,646
Before you form any lasting judgment
on me...

1045
01:37:38,982 --> 01:37:41,937
it was the only way
I could get Fraser out into the open.

1046
01:37:42,027 --> 01:37:43,819
We almost got killed.

1047
01:37:44,196 --> 01:37:47,363
You could have got killed
robbing that bank, too.

1048
01:37:51,245 --> 01:37:52,704
Are they gone?

1049
01:37:52,913 --> 01:37:54,324
We can't worry about them.

1050
01:37:54,415 --> 01:37:56,905
We have to get back to town
before morning.

1051
01:37:57,167 --> 01:37:59,207
What's gonna happen to us?

1052
01:38:00,003 --> 01:38:01,498
I don't know.

1053
01:38:02,089 --> 01:38:04,496
We'll get a fair trial, won't we?

1054
01:38:04,675 --> 01:38:07,344
Lots of men get a fair trial and hang.

1055
01:38:07,886 --> 01:38:10,922
We were gonna give back
our share of the money.

1056
01:38:11,014 --> 01:38:12,806
I know you were, Son.

1057
01:38:13,434 --> 01:38:14,892
And confess.

1058
01:38:14,977 --> 01:38:17,017
And we did try to stop the killing.

1059
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:19,310
- I know, Daniel. I wish...
- Pa!

1060
01:38:55,392 --> 01:38:57,301
I'll get the money, Pa.

1061
01:38:59,438 --> 01:39:01,062
Here, Billy Joe.

1062
01:39:03,066 --> 01:39:04,312
Hold it.

1063
01:39:24,838 --> 01:39:26,961
You'd even shoot a dead man!

1064
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:30,126
No, and I ain't gonna let him
shoot me, neither.

1065
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:31,458
Get up.

1066
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:34,465
Get me a rope.

1067
01:39:52,324 --> 01:39:53,522
Budger.

1068
01:39:55,244 --> 01:39:57,283
You're bleeding again, Pa.

1069
01:39:58,497 --> 01:40:00,620
I guess it goes with the badge.

1070
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:02,700
- You got a kerchief?
- Yeah.

1071
01:40:04,962 --> 01:40:07,879
Jam it in this hole. It'll stop the bleeding.

1072
01:40:10,967 --> 01:40:12,628
Here, I'll do it.

1073
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:21,304
Thank you, Pa.

1074
01:40:23,146 --> 01:40:25,139
Here's the money, all of it.

1075
01:40:25,274 --> 01:40:26,353
Good.

1076
01:40:28,193 --> 01:40:29,521
I hope...

1077
01:40:31,947 --> 01:40:34,235
Now what's gonna happen to us?

1078
01:40:34,908 --> 01:40:37,826
They're gonna be
a little short of witnesses.

1079
01:40:38,829 --> 01:40:42,447
And I can sure testify
that you got the town its money back.

1080
01:40:43,709 --> 01:40:46,912
Do you think
that it'll be reason enough maybe...

1081
01:40:47,003 --> 01:40:49,625
for the judge to put us in your custody?

1082
01:40:49,715 --> 01:40:51,339
I don't know, Son.

1083
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:52,830
He might.

1084
01:40:53,135 --> 01:40:54,843
But we can't depend on it.

1085
01:40:56,180 --> 01:41:00,177
If he does, does that mean
you'll be staying around home more?

1086
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:03,176
If you'll promise me one thing:

1087
01:41:08,233 --> 01:41:09,857
Don't rob banks.

1088
01:41:15,699 --> 01:41:17,692
Let's go stop a hanging.

1089
01:41:18,692 --> 01:41:28,692
