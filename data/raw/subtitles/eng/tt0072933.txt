00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:53,470
EMMANUELLE 2

2
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,889
Follow me, ma'am.

3
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,393
Here, ma'am, 72.

4
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,063
- You joking?
- No, is this your bag?

5
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,232
But I got a 1st class cabin,

6
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,151
not a dormitory.

7
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,736
A collective cabin,

8
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,322
exclusively reserved for ladies.

9
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,823
Lucky for me.

10
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,368
Sorry, it's not our fault.

11
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,246
The agency must have made
a mistake. Verify it yourself.

12
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,584
See, place 72, deck 3.
It's here, ma'am.

13
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,421
But I paid for a 1st class ticket!

14
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,424
All I can do is cancel the ticket.

15
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,470
But you'll have to wait
until next week to go 1st class.

16
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,389
July 18th.

17
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,933
No thanks, I prefer the dorm.

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,685
At your service, ma'am.

19
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,229
- <i>Bon voyage.</i>
- Thank you.

20
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,564
I reserved in 1st class, too.

21
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,693
What imbeciles! Incompetent!

22
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,196
Do you have a comb I can borrow?

23
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,781
Of course.

24
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,453
- Here.
- Thank you.

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,955
See you later.

26
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,065
He doesn't know I'm coming.
I'd like to call him now.

27
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,318
- Call him?
- Yes, my husband.

28
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,823
- Where is he?
- Hong Kong.

29
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,619
I don't know if you know this,
but you can't call from here,

30
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,663
you send messages with this.

31
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,666
Yes, I meant send a message.

32
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,710
It's not really the same thing.

33
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,505
You must be 3 miles from
the coast to send a message,

34
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,509
or have special permission
from the Commander.

35
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,928
It's maritime law, I can do nothing.

36
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,348
They put me on the 3rd deck
instead of 1st class.

37
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,767
Also maritime law?

38
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,312
What? You, in the dorm?
That's horrible.

39
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,190
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,026
You should have asked for Igor.

41
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,570
Yes, I'm Igor.

42
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,158
When something's wrong,
you ask for Igor and it'll be OK.

43
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,203
Such as tonight,
you'll sleep in my cabin.

44
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,039
That's very nice. And you?

45
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:54,461
Wherever, on a deck chair
or in the Pasha's bathtub.

46
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,297
It's OK.
Write your message down,

47
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,967
I'll send it out top priority.

48
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,183
Beautiful, sensual handwriting,

49
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,561
written by no less beautiful hands.

50
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,564
Thank you!

51
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,486
Don't fill that out,
I'll take care of it.

52
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,909
Has it been long since
you've seen your husband?

53
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,702
Two months.

54
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,704
That's a long time!

55
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,801
Is that maritime law too?

56
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,602
If you change your mind,
don't hesitate. Cabin 8, deck one.

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,021
Bitch!

58
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,312
Are you OK?

59
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,148
No.

60
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,861
- You're sick?
- No.

61
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,040
- Here.
- I'm not thirsty!

62
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,879
What's wrong?

63
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,757
This place scares me.

64
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,551
What? I can't hear you.

65
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,346
I'm scared.

66
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,642
There's nothing to be afraid of.

67
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,145
Yes! All these women!

68
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,067
Three women took me.
Do you understand?

69
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,569
No.

70
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,155
Raped me.

71
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,824
I was raped by 3 women.

72
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,868
- Here?
- No, not here.

73
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,371
In Macau.
I was in boarding school.

74
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,248
I was 16.

75
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,167
A virgin.

76
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,421
I'd never had an orgasm.

77
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,258
One night, I was in the library

78
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,176
with a few girls.

79
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,263
There were 3 of them.
They were laughing.

80
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,599
Three Filipinos.

81
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,978
One held my arms behind my back,

82
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,773
another held my face.

83
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,401
She kissed me on the mouth.

84
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,738
I wanted to bite her,
but I was scared.

85
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,119
I felt a hand
under my dress, in my panties.

86
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,126
I didn't want to.

87
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,803
Then they all caressed me at once.

88
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,310
I felt fingers enter me,
hard, very hard.

89
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,106
I came.

90
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,318
It was all over school.

91
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,572
Then, when girls
came into my bed, I liked it.

92
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,990
Do you understand?

93
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,643
Hi, ma'am, we weren't expecting you.

94
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,520
I know. Where's Mr. Jean?

95
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,189
- On the veranda.
- Thanks.

96
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,440
You have soft hands, my little Wong.

97
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,026
Continue.

98
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,404
Oh yes, Mr. Jean!
I'll continue!

99
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,627
Is that good, Mr. Jean?

100
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,253
Yes,

101
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,092
that's very good.

102
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,640
Very good.

103
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,895
Mrs. Jean.

104
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,122
You have a nice moustache,
Mr. Engineer, but it stings.

105
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,458
You wanted me to grow it.

106
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,918
That's true.

107
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,796
It looks good.

108
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,798
Do you think so?

109
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,975
I thought you arrived in 10 days.

110
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,602
It's almost been 2 months, Jean.

111
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,355
63 days, to be precise.

112
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,526
I couldn't stand it.
I took the first boat.

113
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,529
I hope you've adventures
to tell me about.

114
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,072
A lot.

115
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,533
Like what?

116
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,328
The adventures
of a single woman in Bangkok.

117
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,039
Hectic?

118
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,375
Very hectic.

119
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,717
Come on.

120
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,721
I'm waiting for Wong
to finish shaving me.

121
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,392
- I'm going up.
- See you soon.

122
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:09,278
Hi. You know, it's dangerous
if the fan falls in the water.

123
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,448
Yes. I like bathing dangerously.

124
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,660
What are you doing here?

125
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,537
I'm taking my bath.

126
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,417
Sorry, I forgot. Have you met?

127
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,337
Not yet, but she saved my life.

128
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,297
Oh. She's Emmanuelle.

129
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,840
- Your wife!
- Yes.

130
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,635
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

131
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,638
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- Christopher.

132
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,640
Are you English?

133
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,475
A bit, by the women. Half and half.

134
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,352
Go back to your pool.

135
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,687
Lindbergh...

136
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,816
Is it Christopher or Lindbergh?

137
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,318
Lindbergh.
He's a pilot, you know.

138
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,989
A pilot! You always
sleep with your propeller?

139
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,991
It's a real love story.

140
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,410
- I'll tell you.
- Another time.

141
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,586
What's up with the plane?

142
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,005
Nothing, he deals a bit.

143
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,423
Opium?

144
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,009
No, art, I think.

145
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,219
Isn't it risky having him here?

146
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,014
Not at all, don't worry.

147
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,018
- Is he staying long?
- No, a few days.

148
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,022
Fuck me.

149
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,631
Dressed so I'd undress you?

150
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,426
No, I have a meeting,
I have to cancel it.

151
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,737
Hello, Miss.

152
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,199
I've a meeting with Mr. Piang
in half an hour.

153
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,912
Would it be possible
to reschedule it?

154
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,916
Because...

155
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,463
Because his wife
hasn't fucked him in 2 months!

156
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,757
Are you crazy?

157
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,511
What? No, someone else
must be on the line.

158
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,264
Oh, he already left.

159
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,934
Too bad. Thank you.

160
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,697
What is it?

161
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,701
Do you want me to make love
to you for 5 minutes?

162
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,856
Now Hong Kong
won't be thirsty anymore!

163
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,734
I hope you like my article.

164
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,445
Very nice. You exaggerate.

165
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,865
I have to go now.
Thanks for the cigar.

166
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,784
- Bye, ma'am.
- Bye, sir.

167
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,995
Goodbye. See you soon.

168
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,375
Do you like me?
Not bad, front page.

169
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,627
Not bad at all.

170
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,048
Don't you think
you should shave the moustache?

171
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,800
No, do you?

172
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,890
So go on,
was it a pretty French woman?

173
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,895
Yes, with great breasts
and a fantastic body.

174
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,399
And you...

175
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,693
No, she did.

176
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,655
She started off by telling me
a boring rape story

177
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,240
to turn me on.

178
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,244
- This was in the dormitory?
- Yes.

179
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,914
- And no one saw you?
- Yes...

180
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,044
Where have you been 3 days?

181
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,713
My wife, Emmanuelle.
Emmanuelle, Laura.

182
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,715
- Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,384
I'd imagined you differently.

184
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,678
Good or bad?

185
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,680
Bad, obviously.

186
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,601
- Want a drink?
- No, I have plans.

187
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,605
I forgot to confirm for dinner
at Peter's tomorrow.

188
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,067
Bring Emmanuelle.

189
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,653
With pleasure, ma'am.

190
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,613
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

191
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,368
Who's this Peter?

192
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:11,372
Peter's the man Laura lives with.

193
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,377
Did you do Laura?

194
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,254
Yeah.

195
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,092
Was it good?

196
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,927
Yeah, really good.

197
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,971
In water.

198
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,266
In water? In a bathtub?

199
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,102
No, in the sea.

200
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,937
The sea...

201
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,731
Like fish?

202
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,109
Yeah, like fish.

203
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,949
- It's hard, huh?
- Very.

204
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,885
And did you come under water?

205
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,347
Yes.

206
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,320
Look at me.

207
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,334
Look.

208
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,173
Come here.

209
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,180
Come.

210
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,813
I love you.

211
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,482
Me too.

212
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,343
Breakfast?

213
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,529
You have to eat it all,
ma'am said you lost weight.

214
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,749
- What is this?
- Porridge,

215
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:10,170
eggs and bacon,
toast with honey and passion fruit.

216
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,508
The special overworked
frog man menu.

217
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,011
There's the irony!

218
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,055
Don't think I'm jealous,

219
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,559
but it seems to me that your mermaid

220
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:28,021
has the exclusivity
on intoxicating depths

221
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,108
while I get the bathtub
or the shower.

222
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:38,282
Speaking of my mermaid,
we eat at Peter's tonight, remember?

223
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,535
Yes, Laura's friend.

224
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,625
Has your little Laura
done this for you?

225
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,043
No!

226
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,298
I'd rather stay here.

227
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,427
Me too, but it's too late. Too bad!

228
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,805
Peter researches
Asian musicals for UNESCO.

229
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,599
His parties aren't bad.

230
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,895
Come on, make me happy.
Wear your blue dress.

231
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,731
Isn't it a bit too sexy?

232
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,941
I can't, it's in my suitcase.

233
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,945
You can ask Wong to take you
to town to buy a dress.

234
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,284
What if I asked Christopher instead?

235
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,621
Why not? He'll love it,
it's right up his alley!

236
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,047
- They're really pretty.
- Yeah.

237
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,300
You really like
Asian woman, don't you?

238
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,052
Did Jean tell you?

239
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,346
Yes sir, I know all about you.

240
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:47,309
I know that every night
you go to some place called

241
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,810
The Emerald Garden.

242
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,312
The Jade Garden.

243
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,356
The Jade Garden.

244
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,985
And I know white women scare you.

245
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,280
They don't scare me,
I just like yellow ones better.

246
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,617
Best friends repeat
everything to their Wives.

247
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,953
I thought it'd stay between us.

248
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,663
I'm Jean's best friend,

249
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,331
and we share everything.

250
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,083
It's different with a woman.

251
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,960
Well, you see,

252
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,338
it doesn't bother me
that you're a man, quite the contrary.

253
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,175
I could tell you you're sexy.

254
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,511
I think you're very sexy!

255
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,013
Don't be ridiculous. Me, sexy?

256
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,350
Yes, you have a nice smile,
great teeth,

257
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,895
a large nose,
which indicates virility,

258
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,523
as does the neck, the shoulders...

259
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,733
everything! Very sexy!

260
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,236
Do you think I'm sexy?

261
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,363
Want me to punch you?

262
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,691
Good morning!

263
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,156
What's that for?

264
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,951
This is not for you.
Good for very old Chinese gentlemen.

265
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,246
I have something for you. Wait.

266
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,043
This is for you. For beautiful ladies like you.
Try it.

267
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,878
- That's for my hair?
- Yes.

268
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,421
For her pubic hair!

269
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,715
Will you mind your own business?

270
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,218
No. Very good, very good. Magic.

271
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,723
Give me your hand.

272
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,600
Beautiful hands.

273
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,813
Feel good? You like? Really good?

274
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,816
Let's go, this is a trap,
a prank store.

275
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,984
And the good magic?

276
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,488
Feelgood?

277
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,073
That tickles.

278
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,741
OK. We take your stuff.

279
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:19,211
Beautiful lady.
Now try acupuncture for happiness.

280
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,712
But I'm already happy.

281
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,633
No, no, no. This is very special.
For women only. First floor.

282
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,844
Come with me.

283
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,098
- Where?
- It's on the first floor.

284
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,275
Come on, come.

285
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,323
I'm scared.

286
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,826
We can still leave.

287
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,834
I like being scared.

288
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,926
Fantastic, isn't it?

289
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,803
Aquatic...

290
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,100
like little fish.

291
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,744
- Jean told me.
- And?

292
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,331
Seems you swim well.

293
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,752
So does Jean.

294
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,296
He's talented,

295
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,637
and has good taste.

296
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,100
- You're very pretty.
- Thanks.

297
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,850
Asshole! Why'd you tell her?

298
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,685
I tell her everything.

299
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,645
And she's not jealous?

300
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,023
She's intelligent.

301
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,232
That was great!

302
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,610
I knew very well you'd enjoy it.

303
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,530
My daughter promised to join the dancers,
but as usual, she let me down.

304
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,533
That young girl over there?

305
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,454
Yes, that's the little idiot over there.
Anna-Maria.

306
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,832
So I'll just repeat that
you have a lovely house.

307
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:16,169
And I'll repeat again that you're a lovely girl.

308
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,005
Thank you.

309
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,548
Excuse me, please.

310
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,392
- Hello!
- Hello, ma'am.

311
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,270
It seems
you refused to dance tonight?

312
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,899
Yes, my dad's furious.
He'll get over it.

313
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,278
Would you
make a spectacle of yourself

314
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,738
in front of tourists?

315
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,407
I would if I danced like that.

316
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,745
It's easy, you need two fans
and a very good teacher.

317
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,914
Come to the school...

318
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,582
I would like that.

319
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,961
Did you like the show?

320
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,089
Yes, very much.

321
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,425
Yet they kept messing up!

322
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,270
- Be available if we need you.
- Of course.

323
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,948
Good morning.

324
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,660
- Can I do something for you?
- You're very kind. Thank you, no.

325
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:34,956
- Something wrong?
- Nothing at all. Don't worry. Goodbye.

326
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,556
What'd the inspector want?

327
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,642
Nothing, it's a little visa problem.

328
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,186
Cops are interested in you λately.

329
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,147
Really? What now?

330
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,609
An inspector came by the office,
asked about you.

331
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,485
What did you say?

332
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,031
I vouched for you.

333
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,657
Nice of you.

334
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:14,203
It's the Boy Scout in me.
I do a good deed per day.

335
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,374
- It's not serious, I hope?
- No, don't worry.

336
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,335
Hey, that's my shirt!

337
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,378
I didn't notice, I swear.

338
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:26,007
It's ruined. Keep it.

339
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,176
Snap out of it.

340
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,513
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

341
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,309
Thanks.

342
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,198
You caress it like a woman.

343
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,911
Tang Ling at Jade Garden said
I caress her like a prop.

344
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:01,042
Regarding the visit
of those 2 men you saw earlier,

345
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,045
I need to stay a bit longer
than I thought.

346
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,422
Is 4 more days OK with you?

347
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,675
You're kidding.

348
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:10,677
How's Emmanuelle?

349
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,096
She's fine.

350
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,056
It's the special acupuncture.

351
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,058
I think she'll go back.

352
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,060
If she liked it.

353
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,437
She seemed to like it a lot.

354
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,441
You don't mind an old man
made her come with needles?

355
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,112
Emmanuelle does as she likes.

356
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,864
If someone jumps her,
it's OK with you?

357
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,075
First, no one jumps her.

358
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,577
Oh? What do you call it?

359
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,079
She chooses.

360
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,707
That's just talk.

361
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,459
Listen,

362
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,754
I have no rights over Emmanuelle.

363
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,090
She's free. So am I.

364
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,467
You two are strange.

365
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,098
It's too much for you, huh?

366
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,935
You'll never get it into
your stubborn little head.

367
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,863
I'm sorry, madam.

368
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,574
One mustn't disturb the students
when they're in their lessons.

369
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,202
You have to wait in the study here.

370
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,661
See you later.

371
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,512
OK, that's it.

372
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,588
Sorry about earlier,

373
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,924
Naim's often rude to visitors.

374
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,719
Are you still coming to class?

375
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,137
Maybe.

376
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,348
You think he's cute?

377
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,351
He's very cute.
He's your boyfriend?

378
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,353
No, not at all.

379
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,773
All the girls love him, but not me.

380
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,485
Do you have a boyfriend?

381
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,489
Yes, his name is Sam.

382
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,574
He really loves me.

383
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,161
Want to go talk about him
over a cup of tea?

384
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,330
- Yeah, OK.
- Come on.

385
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:18,979
Imagine the effort,

386
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,399
the continual effort boys make.

387
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:25,152
Pick-up lines, eye contact,
pounding hearts,

388
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,823
all that to slip a hand
in a girl's pants.

389
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,534
That's all they think of.

390
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,703
Us too, no?

391
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,338
At least I did.

392
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,006
How they'd try...

393
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,135
It turned me on.

394
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,805
Is Jean your first love?

395
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,559
My first love,
but not the first one I made love to.

396
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,437
The first time, it was a guy.

397
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,355
I remember,

398
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:05,526
he always wore big jackets.
He was the nicest guy.

399
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,657
He was so Clumsy!

400
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,995
He was unsure of himself,
I said he was great!

401
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,330
Were you with him long?

402
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,540
Not really.

403
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,001
It was just to lose my virginity.

404
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,335
And then?

405
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,714
I waited 6 months
before doing it again.

406
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,216
That one gave me my 1st orgasm.

407
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,438
Want to come over?

408
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,399
No, I'm a bit tired. Next time.

409
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,045
You're not going further with Sam?

410
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,631
What do you do?

411
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,758
We kiss.

412
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,636
- That's it?
- Yes.

413
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,722
Doesn't he want to go further?

414
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,433
No.

415
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,104
Liar. There's no Sam.

416
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:32,780
I'm dumb.
I invent stories while I dream.

417
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,617
While touching yourself?

418
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,410
No.

419
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,454
Yes...

420
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,830
Sometimes.

421
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,028
Ma'am, your husband has a call.

422
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,699
Yes, but he's playing right now.
I'll go.

423
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,874
Hi, beautiful!

424
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,334
Hi, Jean.

425
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,503
- Is Laura here?
- Yes.

426
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,885
You love Laura, don't you?

427
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,096
No, what makes you think that?

428
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,556
Nothing.

429
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,601
I really like Emmanuelle.

430
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,814
But there's something
about you two I don't get.

431
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,900
You play with love.

432
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:26,198
If you mean we sleep around,
and call that playing,

433
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,407
then yes, we play.

434
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,410
Isn't it dangerous?

435
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,038
No. Sex isn't dangerous,

436
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,249
love is.

437
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:39,586
Here's a secret, I don't love Laura,
I love Emmanuelle.

438
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,756
And if you fall in love one day?

439
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,801
Well, that's a risk, I like risks.

440
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,928
So does Emmanuelle.

441
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,429
She knows?

442
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,432
Yes, I hide nothing.

443
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,143
It's how a couple acts, no?

444
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,271
I don't know.

445
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,818
No lies, even by omission.

446
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:09,199
I've no rights over Emmanuelle,
her pleasure is mine.

447
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,786
So, you're flirting?

448
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,436
Oh shit!

449
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,107
That's all I needed.

450
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,776
What's wrong?

451
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,446
- Did you hear about Nina?
- No.

452
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,325
- Singer?
- Force 8 typhoon.

453
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,786
Over Formosa, be here in 3 days.

454
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,789
Why do they give that shit
women's names?

455
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,125
Why? Is it bad for you?

456
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:05,505
No, but I have to leave fast.
I have 2 days to take off.

457
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,676
Where will you go?

458
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,511
Australia.

459
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,180
A problem?

460
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,599
No, I don't think so.

461
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,684
A typhoon won't mess you up?

462
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,520
The drilling station's OK.
May inspect it.

463
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,274
Another time.

464
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,152
Gotta go to the hangar, bye!

465
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,820
Don't forget your prop.

466
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,280
Thanks.

467
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,201
Oh, my God!

468
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,745
It's hotter in here
than it is outside!

469
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,876
I know! What heat!

470
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,301
I slept all day.

471
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,638
I couldn't even hold a pencil.

472
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,306
Take us to the baths?

473
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,686
Good idea.

474
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,688
Coming?

475
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,064
No, you two go on.

476
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,191
I can't move.

477
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,486
Be nice, Anna-Maria,
I want you to come,

478
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,197
indulge me.

479
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,075
Are you coming?

480
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,010
Which one do you want?

481
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,262
I don't know.

482
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,431
Whichever.

483
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,101
I've chosen.

484
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,437
Be nice, let Anna-Maria pick.

485
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,731
It's her first time here.

486
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,942
Which one?

487
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,948
That one, I think.
The one on the right.

488
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,576
- Can I?
- Of course.

489
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,123
I'd have picked that one.

490
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,834
I'm not surprised.

491
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,553
Are you happy?

492
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,183
I'm happy you're here.

493
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,397
That both of you are here.

494
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,407
There you are!

495
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,283
I looked everywhere!

496
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,285
Surprise, I'm going with you.

497
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,579
- That's impossible.
- Why?

498
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,499
I have to work. It's not nice there.

499
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,209
I'm leaving with you.

500
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,504
Don't be stubborn. OK?

501
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,173
Not OK. Let's go.

502
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,342
- Want me to tell you?
- What?

503
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:32,345
I have a surprise for you,
a real one.

504
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:33,805
What surprise?

505
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,933
Pack your bags,
we're leaving tomorrow.

506
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,978
- Where?
- Bali.

507
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,147
Bali!

508
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,358
That's fantastic!

509
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,360
Are you happy?

510
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,446
OK, I'll leave you alone.

511
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,452
The bags are ready, ma'am.
Here's your red dress.

512
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:02,208
I think I'll order
a white dress with red stripes.

513
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,253
No, brown.

514
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,009
Wong, bring my wig, I have an idea.

515
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,388
There, Mrs. Jean,
you're a real girl from heaven!

516
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,182
You think so?

517
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,727
Now Mrs. Jean is prettiest
Chinese girl in Hong Kong.

518
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,190
- <i>Hello, ma 'am.</i>
- Hello.

519
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,192
<i>Is Mr. Christopher there?</i>

520
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,236
No, sir, hold on a moment.

521
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,989
Do you know
where Mr. Christopher is?

522
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,868
Hello, sir.
I don't know where he is.

523
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,579
<i>It's very urgent.</i>

524
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,249
<i>He must contact Mr. Ming.
Understand? Ming. Quickly.</i>

525
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,503
<i>Otherwise he'll...
Just tell him to contact Ming.</i>

526
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:49,088
<i>That's it. Goodnight, ma'am.</i>

527
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,680
Listen, it's very important.

528
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,099
You don't know
where Christopher is?

529
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,185
Maybe Jade Garden, ma'am.

530
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,521
Jade Garden. Is it far?

531
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,189
No, very close.

532
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,441
Listen, I'll explain.

533
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:12,028
You go there,
and find Mr. Christopher.

534
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,532
Tell him Ming called, Mr. Ming.

535
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,243
No, ma'am,
I can't go to Jade Garden.

536
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,537
Why not?

537
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,789
I'm scared.

538
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:50,483
- Can I go upstairs, please?
- No, no. You can't.

539
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,945
- But my friend's inside.
- No, no.

540
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:58,908
You have to be with somebody
to go inside. Can I help you?

541
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,578
No, thanks, I'll handle it.

542
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,083
I'm looking for a date.

543
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,962
She's looking for a date!

544
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,631
She's my sister!

545
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,671
Why're you here dressed as a Whore?

546
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,298
- Ming called.
- So?

547
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,469
Sorry.

548
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,431
He said you had to call him.

549
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,683
Screw Ming.

550
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,309
This place excites you.

551
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,894
What's with you?

552
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:39,652
Is it this manly fair
that puts you in this state?

553
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:43,698
Is it illegal to get excited,
or just reserved for men?

554
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,120
Women here are paid
to make other people come.

555
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,874
Stupid idiot. And women?

556
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,877
They're just machines
to fuck for you.

557
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,921
You think you hate them,
but they scare you.

558
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,886
She's with me, OK? Get out.

559
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,346
What's this?

560
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,891
We pay for girls with it.

561
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:16,773
Do you realize you're paying
for girls with casino chips?

562
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,983
Don't you think it's pathetic?

563
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,111
Are you done yelling at me?
Let's go.

564
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,113
You know I leave tomorrow.

565
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,952
I'm staying, I want to make love.

566
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,121
Me too.

567
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,711
Too late Christopher.
I really wanted you,

568
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:43,132
but I make love to whom I want,
when I want. Bye!

569
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,939
It's the immaculate virgin!

570
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,191
Why are you here at this hour?

571
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,194
I don't get along with dad,
I left home.

572
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,363
Finally! Bravo!

573
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,032
Are you leaving?

574
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,162
Can you hand me that shirt?

575
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,336
You're lucky I'm going,

576
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,673
I'd love to get you
between the sheets.

577
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,216
You too?

578
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,802
Yeah, me too.

579
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,227
Thank Jean for his shirt

580
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:39,230
and Emmanuelle
for her moral lessons.

581
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,191
Emmanuelle gave you lessons
in morality?

582
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,777
Yes, a real philosophy professor.

583
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:49,699
This is for the road.

584
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:09,844
What? You're not gonna cry.
What are you afraid of?

585
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,013
Men still?

586
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,309
You're 18, you're pretty, superb,

587
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:20,313
among all the toads,
you'll meet Prince Charming one day.

588
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,274
Bye, cutie.

589
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,678
Oh, Emmanuelle!

590
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,306
I didn't want to wake you.

591
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,894
I got into a fight with my dad.

592
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,979
I left home.

593
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,690
I didn't know where to go.

594
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,110
You were right to come here.

595
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,447
You'll tell me about it.

596
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,532
Your dress is cute.

597
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,162
Christopher left.

598
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,789
I know.

599
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,460
I'm sad.

600
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,593
Things will work out.

601
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,389
We're going to Bali tomorrow,
you'll come with us.

602
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,107
Jean's not sleeping here tonight.

603
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,275
Do you want to sleep with me?

604
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:52,738
No. I'd rather stay here.

605
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,366
I'm fine, I promise.

606
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,558
What's Anna-Maria doing here?

607
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:25,229
She had a fight with her dad,
wanted to sleep on the sofa.

608
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,232
I'm beat.

609
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,822
She's coming to Bali with us.

610
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,663
You look great!

611
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,415
Yeah, I'm good.

612
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:51,797
I went to the Jade Garden last night.

613
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,091
I saw Christopher.

614
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,053
- He didn't leave?
- Yes.

615
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,599
And you slept with him?

616
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,602
No.

617
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,440
Well, what did you do?

618
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,986
What did I do?

619
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,785
I slept with three men.

620
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,661
Really?

621
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,998
- Was it good?
- I'll show you.

622
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,918
-Did you get paid?
- Yes!

623
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,836
How much?

624
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,797
A lot!

625
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,884
Tell me.

626
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,637
Go on, tell me.

627
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:52,528
Tell me,
that boy who's with Anna-Maria...

628
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,614
- Who? Michael?
- Yes, Michael.

629
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,908
She likes him, huh?

630
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:01,787
Are you jealous?

631
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,288
No, I want her.

632
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,499
She excites me.

633
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,044
What did you say?

634
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:12,422
I said Anna-Maria excites me.

635
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,302
Do you think she likes you?

636
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,932
Are you gonna answer?

637
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,308
You must ask her.

638
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:27,062
How about her eyes?

639
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,231
Blue.

640
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:33,110
And her nose, her mouth...

641
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,905
Stop, you're turning me on!

642
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,740
Her legs, her breasts...

643
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,242
I can't take it!

644
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,497
Are you sure? Come on then.

645
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:46,999
I'm coming.

646
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,755
The little sluts.

647
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:59,011
Is it true what you said?

648
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,554
No, not at all.

649
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,600
You're ugly, I don't like you.

650
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:09,021
- I hate you!
- Me too.
