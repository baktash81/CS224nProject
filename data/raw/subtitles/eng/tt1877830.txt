00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:44,965
<i>Hey.</i>

712
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:46,633
Hey.

713
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,971
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

714
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:53,473
How you been?

715
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:57,519
Yeah, I've been okay.

716
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:00,230
<i>I was just...</i>

717
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:04,109
I was just headed back upstairs.

718
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,861
Well...

719
00:51:06,945 --> 00:51:08,613
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

720
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:25,088
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

721
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:26,757
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

722

<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

723
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,552
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

724
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:31,720

I lost you in there.

732
00:51:47,652 --> 00:51:48,737

739
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:10,550

[Batman] What do you know about

759
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:42,661
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

760
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,457
Yeah, sure, there was.

761
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:50,001
That's the rat we're looking for.

762
00:54:50,919 --> 00:54:52,796
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

763
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,383
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

764
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:57,926
Where are you getting this?

765
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:00,887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

766
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,140
Gil's very nervous.

767
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,643
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

768
00:55:06,726 --> 00:55:08,603
I worked that case.

769
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:10,647
Riddler's not after you.

770

How do you know?

771
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:13,442
You're not corrupt.

772
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:16,027
Colson's dirty?

773
00:55:21,908 --> 00:55:23,410
Maybe I, uh...

774
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:27,414
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

775
00:55:27,497 --> 00:55:30,792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

776
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,336
Who knows how many people it touches.

777
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,631
Politicians. Police. The courts.

778
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:39,634
It could tear the whole city apart.

779
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,095
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

780
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:45,474

794
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:08,413
She a new friend of yours?

795
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:14,211
I'm not so sure.

796
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:16,546
Looks like you upset her.

797
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:19,841
Shall I take this as a good sign?

798
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:20,926
What?

799
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:21,927
Your attire.

800
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,137
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

801
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:26,223
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

802
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:28,975
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

803
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:31,603
Riddler might not be able to resist.

804
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,146
Oh, that reminds me.

805
00:56:34,314 --> 00:56:38,276
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

806
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:40,320
The one from the rat maze.

807
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:43,824
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

808
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,034
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

809
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:49,371
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

810
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:51,415
[Bruce] <i>Rata Alada?</i>

811
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:52,707
"Rat with wings"?

812
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:55,293
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

813
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:56,628
Yeah.

814
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,214
A stool pigeon.

815
00:56:59,464 --> 00:57:01,091
Where are your cufflinks?

816
00:57:01,174 --> 00:57:02,134
I couldn't find them.

817
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:05,554
Well, you can't go out like that.

818
00:57:05,637 --> 00:57:07,431
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

819
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,396

You're still a Wayne.

would you, slick?

Hey, watch it, fellas.

You got the prince of the city there.

843
00:59:17,477 --> 00:59:20,439
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:22,983
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

845
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:24,693
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

846
00:59:24,776 --> 00:59:26,778
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

847
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:29,072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

848
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:31,158
Wow. Is that right?

849
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:33,285
His father saved my life.

850
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:37,456
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

851
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:42,169
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

Operated right on the dining room table.

853

Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

I remember your face.

855
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:58,393
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

856
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

857
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,815
"Hippocratic oath."

858
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:07,569
That's good.

01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,553
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

886
01:01:14,636 --> 01:01:17,305
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

887
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:18,723
Will you walk with me?

Mr. Wayne.

891
01:01:27,232 --> 01:01:30,318
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

892
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:32,738
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

893
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:35,240
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

894
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:37,784
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

895
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:39,661
Thank you.

I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

898
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:47,586
I want to continue this.

899

Excuse me.

Can I talk to you?

[Mackenzie] What?

905
01:02:06,229 --> 01:02:08,523
He hasn't been heard from

Christ, not again.

907

You got people looking for him, Jim?

[Gordon] Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

910

[Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?

911
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:21,411
[Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

Please.

He made me do it.
[tearfully] I'm so sorry.

He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

I'm so sorry.

Can't we just cut it off?

- "Justice."
- Huh?

The answer's "justice."

- [raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

I have family, people I love.

- Who will?

- People are watching.
- What people?

[Martinez]
Who do you think he is under there?

1059
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:36,990
[Gordon] Take it easy.

1060
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:38,075
[Martinez] I want to see.

1061
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:40,619
[medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1062
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:45,832
[medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1063
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,375
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1064
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:48,668
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1065
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:49,920
- [Gordon] Hey!
- [officers clamoring]

1066
01:10:50,504 --> 01:10:53,632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1067
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:55,383
Relax, God damn it!

1068
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:56,968
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1069
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,931
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1070
01:11:01,014 --> 01:11:03,433
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1071
01:11:03,517 --> 01:11:04,935
Maybe it's on yours.

1072
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:07,437
What'd you say?

1073
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:09,106
He would rather die than talk.

1074
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:11,191
What was he afraid of?

1075
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:13,026
You?

[menacing music playing]

1077
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:21,576
You son of a bitch.

1078
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,163
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1079
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,957
You could be an accessory to murder.

1080
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,041
[officer] Why are we playing games...

1081

[officers clamoring]

1082
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:31,044
[Officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1083
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,130
Back off! Back off!

1084
01:11:33,213 --> 01:11:35,507
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1085
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,676
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

1086
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:40,554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1087
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,681
[breathing heavily]

1088
01:11:43,223 --> 01:11:44,766
You too now?

1089
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,394
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1090
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:50,063
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

1091
01:11:50,147 --> 01:11:52,399
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1092
01:11:55,193 --> 01:11:56,695
Okay, give him the room.

1093
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:13,628
Two minutes.

1094
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:26,975
You listen to me.

1095
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,562
[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1096
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,191
That would put a lot of heat on you.

1097
01:12:34,274 --> 01:12:35,942
Well, you punched me in the face.

1098
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:38,111
[Batman scoffs]

1099
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:39,488
Take this key.

1100
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:44,159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1101
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:46,912
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1102
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:50,207
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

[suspenseful music playing]

1104
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:55,962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

1105
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:02,094
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1106
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:05,097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1107
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1108
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1109
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:19,403
- [officer] Jesus Christ!
- [Kenzie] Go!

1110
01:13:19,486 --> 01:13:20,987
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1111

[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1120
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:50,786
I did.

1121
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:54,247
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

1122
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:56,374
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1123
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,584
I only trust you.

1124
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,003
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1125
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:03,465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1126
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:05,342
You think Penguin's the rat?

1127
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:08,470
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1128
01:15:08,553 --> 01:15:10,514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1129
01:15:10,597 --> 01:15:11,932
DA was a regular too.

1130
01:15:12,015 --> 01:15:15,519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

1131
01:15:16,603 --> 01:15:17,813
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

1132
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:18,855
The what?

1133
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,398
Riddler's latest.

1134
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,192
The cipher in the maze.

1135
01:15:22,275 --> 01:15:24,778
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1136
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:27,989
A penguin's got wings too.

1137
01:15:29,991 --> 01:15:31,952
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1138
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:33,703
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1139
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:36,998
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

1140
01:15:37,082 --> 01:15:40,252
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

[Batman] <i>I'm here.</i>

1151

- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?

1152
01:16:21,752 --> 01:16:24,254
[Penguin] Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

It's a drug lab. Drops.

This is a buy.

1157
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:50,572
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

1158
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:51,823
Or they never shut it down at all.

1159

[Gordon] <i>What are you saying?</i>

1160
01:16:52,866 --> 01:16:55,994

was a fraud?

- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1423

Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1424

She didn't know any better.

1425

explained it to her.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1427
01:36:57,195 --> 01:36:58,697
It means your choices have consequences.

1429
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:03,952
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

- Was it worth it?
- What?

1431

You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1435

Falcone owes me that money.

1436

- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1437

Oh, really? Why's that?

1438
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:23,889
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1439
01:37:23,972 --> 01:37:25,724
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1440
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:26,808
would owe you anything.

1441
01:37:26,892 --> 01:37:29,227
[shouts]
Because he's my father!

1442
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:41,156
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1443
01:37:42,657 --> 01:37:43,950
Just like Anni.

1444
01:37:46,119 --> 01:37:48,663
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1445
01:37:50,749 --> 01:37:52,084
To the club?

1446
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:54,002
Yeah.

1447
01:37:56,713 --> 01:37:59,591
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1448
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:01,802
Used to see him there.

1449
01:38:02,552 --> 01:38:04,554
He scared the shit out of me.

1450
01:38:06,515 --> 01:38:09,976
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1451
01:38:10,519 --> 01:38:14,356
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1452
01:38:17,734 --> 01:38:20,070
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1453
01:38:20,737 --> 01:38:22,239
Strangled.

1454
01:38:22,656 --> 01:38:26,118
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1455
01:38:27,994 --> 01:38:30,080
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1456
01:38:30,163 --> 01:38:32,332
and he didn't say a thing.

1457
01:38:34,167 --> 01:38:35,961
Couldn't even look at me.

1458
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:41,466
He owes me that money.

1459
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,678
I'm sorry.

1460
01:38:45,804 --> 01:38:46,972
For what I said.

1461
01:38:48,348 --> 01:38:49,766
Oh, it's all right.

to go after these creeps.

1577
01:45:17,904 --> 01:45:19,740
But you'd be surprised

1578
01:45:19,823 --> 01:45:22,200
what even a good man like him

1579
01:45:22,284 --> 01:45:24,870
is capable of in the right situation.

1580
01:45:27,122 --> 01:45:28,582
Do me a favor.

1581
01:45:28,915 --> 01:45:30,959
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1582
01:45:31,668 --> 01:45:33,253
This reporter

1583
01:45:34,087 --> 01:45:35,672
was a lowlife.

1584
01:45:35,756 --> 01:45:37,215
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1585
01:45:38,842 --> 01:45:40,469
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1586
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:44,473
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1587
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:49,394
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1588
01:45:49,478 --> 01:45:51,813
that your father would be in my pocket,

1589
01:45:52,564 --> 01:45:53,565
forever.

1590
01:45:54,232 --> 01:45:56,276
He would have done anything

1591
01:45:56,359 --> 01:45:58,528
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1592
01:45:58,612 --> 01:45:59,946
You understand?

1593
01:46:01,156 --> 01:46:05,702
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1594
01:46:05,786 --> 01:46:07,829
Do I know it for a fact?

1595
01:46:10,248 --> 01:46:12,334
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1596
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:16,004
This is what you wanted, huh?

1597
01:46:16,088 --> 01:46:18,507
This little conversation here?

1598
01:46:19,007 --> 01:46:20,425
[exhales ruefully]

1599
01:46:20,926 --> 01:46:23,095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1600
01:46:25,722 --> 01:46:27,849
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1601
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:33,396
[melancholy music playing]

1602
01:47:17,524 --> 01:47:19,484
[EKG machine beeping]

1603
01:47:22,946 --> 01:47:24,614
[inhales sharply]

1604
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:31,621
[rain pattering]

1605
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:35,500
[sighs]

1606
01:47:37,252 --> 01:47:38,545
You lied to me...

1607
01:47:41,381 --> 01:47:43,008
my whole life.

1608
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,223
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1609
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,605
He told me what he did for my father.

1610
01:48:00,609 --> 01:48:02,110
About Salvatore Maroni.

1611
01:48:04,112 --> 01:48:06,823
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1612
01:48:06,907 --> 01:48:08,658
Had my father killed.

1613
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,330
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1614
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:20,629
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1615
01:48:20,712 --> 01:48:23,048
believing that he was a good man.

1616
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:24,716
He was a good man.

1617
01:48:25,884 --> 01:48:27,594
You listen to me.

1618
01:48:27,677 --> 01:48:31,098
Your father was a good man.

1619
01:48:34,726 --> 01:48:36,645
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1620
01:48:36,728 --> 01:48:38,647
He had a man killed.

1621
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:39,815
Why?

1622
01:48:40,982 --> 01:48:44,236
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1623
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,571
His political aspirations?

1624
01:48:46,655 --> 01:48:50,200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1625
01:48:52,786 --> 01:48:54,329
He was protecting your mother.

1626
01:48:55,288 --> 01:48:58,834
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1627
01:48:58,917 --> 01:49:01,044
He cared about her,

1628
01:49:01,128 --> 01:49:02,421
and you,

1629
01:49:02,504 --> 01:49:05,424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1630
01:49:05,507 --> 01:49:08,969
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1631
01:49:09,845 --> 01:49:13,181
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1632
01:49:13,265 --> 01:49:16,393
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1633
01:49:16,476 --> 01:49:18,311
That's who Falcone is.

1634
01:49:20,564 --> 01:49:22,774
And that was your father's mistake.

1635
01:49:22,858 --> 01:49:24,901
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1636
01:49:24,985 --> 01:49:27,738
your father was distraught.

1637
01:49:28,613 --> 01:49:31,825
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1638
01:49:31,908 --> 01:49:34,077
that he would confess everything.

1639
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:37,581
And that night,

1640
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:41,585
your father and your mother were killed.

1641
01:49:44,004 --> 01:49:46,173
[soft music playing]

1642
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:48,842
It was Falcone?

1643
01:49:53,346 --> 01:49:54,806
[smacks lips]

1644
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:57,017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1645
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:05,275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1646
01:50:05,358 --> 01:50:08,111
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1647
01:50:08,195 --> 01:50:13,408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1648
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:19,039
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1649
01:50:19,706 --> 01:50:21,500
I know you always blamed yourself.

1650
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:24,127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1651
01:50:26,296 --> 01:50:28,590
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1652
01:50:30,008 --> 01:50:32,385
but I didn't know how to help.

1653
01:50:32,469 --> 01:50:34,971
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1654
01:50:36,348 --> 01:50:39,017
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1655
01:50:39,101 --> 01:50:40,936
You needed a father.

1656
01:50:42,896 --> 01:50:45,315
And all you had was me.

1657
01:50:47,692 --> 01:50:48,902
I'm sorry.

1658
01:50:50,654 --> 01:50:52,572
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1659
01:50:59,371 --> 01:51:00,455
God.

1660
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,921
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1661
01:51:10,632 --> 01:51:12,759
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1662
01:51:19,182 --> 01:51:20,434
I mean,

1663
01:51:21,643 --> 01:51:23,770
I'm not afraid to die.

1664
01:51:25,522 --> 01:51:27,899
I realize now there's something

1665
01:51:29,025 --> 01:51:30,902
I haven't got past.

1666
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:33,572
This fear...

1667
01:51:36,032 --> 01:51:38,994
of ever going through any of that again.

1668
01:51:43,248 --> 01:51:45,459
Of losing somebody I care about.

1669
01:51:46,793 --> 01:51:49,087
[soft music continues]

1670
01:52:13,403 --> 01:52:15,113
[soft dramatic music playing]

1671
01:52:18,116 --> 01:52:19,785
[engine revving]

1672
01:52:36,051 --> 01:52:37,010
Hey.

1673
01:52:37,094 --> 01:52:39,846
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1674
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,848
I thought it was you.

1675
01:52:46,019 --> 01:52:47,395
[both grunting]

1676
01:52:54,778 --> 01:52:56,321
- I found him!
- I see that.

1677
01:52:56,405 --> 01:52:57,906
He had my shit and my phone.

1678
01:52:57,989 --> 01:52:59,199
She left a message
the night they took her.

1679
01:52:59,282 --> 01:53:00,200
She called me...

1680
01:53:00,283 --> 01:53:01,993
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1681
01:53:02,077 --> 01:53:03,370
She got my gun!

1682
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:04,621
[grunts]

1683
01:53:04,704 --> 01:53:06,415
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1684
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,502
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1685
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:17,175
- [cell phone beeps]
- Here. Listen.

1686
01:53:19,136 --> 01:53:20,804
[Kenzie on recording]
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1687
01:53:20,929 --> 01:53:23,098
- [Annika whimpering]
- <i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1688
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:25,267
[Falcone] <i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1689
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:26,685
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1690
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:28,478
[Kenzie] <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1691
01:53:28,562 --> 01:53:29,604
[Annika, tearfully]
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1692
01:53:29,688 --> 01:53:30,981
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1693
01:53:31,064 --> 01:53:33,734
[Falcone]
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1694
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:37,654
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1695
01:53:38,363 --> 01:53:40,907
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- [Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1696
01:53:40,991 --> 01:53:43,910
[Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1697
01:53:43,994 --> 01:53:46,705
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1698
01:53:47,247 --> 01:53:49,249
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1699
01:53:49,958 --> 01:53:52,836
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1700
01:53:52,919 --> 01:53:55,630
[Annika] <i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1701
01:53:55,714 --> 01:53:57,841
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1702
01:53:57,924 --> 01:54:01,052
[Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1703
01:54:01,887 --> 01:54:04,431
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1704
01:54:05,515 --> 01:54:06,850
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1705
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:11,188
[Annika] <i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1706
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:12,898
[Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1707
01:54:12,981 --> 01:54:14,941
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1708
01:54:15,025 --> 01:54:16,318
<i>The deal.</i>

1709
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:21,323
[Annika] <i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1710
01:54:21,406 --> 01:54:24,117
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1711
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:26,578
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1712
01:54:26,661 --> 01:54:27,788
[Falcone] <i>Right.</i>

1713
01:54:28,538 --> 01:54:29,915
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1714
01:54:30,874 --> 01:54:33,043
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1715
01:54:35,128 --> 01:54:36,880
- [tussling on recording]
- [Annika screams]

1716
01:54:37,839 --> 01:54:39,341
- [Annika cries]
- [tussling continues]

1717
01:54:40,717 --> 01:54:42,052
- [Falcone] <i>Just take it easy.</i>
- [Annika choking]

1718
01:54:42,135 --> 01:54:43,678
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1719
01:54:43,762 --> 01:54:46,807
[Falcone] <i>Take it easy.</i>

1720
01:54:48,934 --> 01:54:50,352
[recording stops]

1721
01:54:56,024 --> 01:54:57,317
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1722
01:55:02,072 --> 01:55:03,865
A falcon has wings too.

1723
01:55:04,199 --> 01:55:06,034
Falcone is the rat?

1724
01:55:17,003 --> 01:55:20,173
Falcone works for you guys?

1725
01:55:20,841 --> 01:55:23,385
The mayor? The DA?

1726
01:55:26,388 --> 01:55:27,472
No.

1727
01:55:27,806 --> 01:55:29,307
[breathing shakily]

1728
01:55:30,559 --> 01:55:31,852
We work for him.

1729
01:55:32,853 --> 01:55:34,104
Everybody does.

1730
01:55:34,187 --> 01:55:35,188
How?

1731
01:55:35,272 --> 01:55:36,857
Through Renewal.

1732
01:55:37,649 --> 01:55:39,025
Renewal is everything.

1733
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:40,444
- The Renewal Fund?
- [Kenzie] Yeah.

1734
01:55:41,027 --> 01:55:44,740
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1735
01:55:44,823 --> 01:55:48,410
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1736
01:55:48,493 --> 01:55:51,872
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1737
01:55:51,955 --> 01:55:54,040
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1738
01:55:54,124 --> 01:55:55,834
Everybody got a piece.

1739
01:55:55,917 --> 01:55:57,753
But Falcone wanted more.

1740
01:55:59,546 --> 01:56:02,758
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1741
01:56:04,176 --> 01:56:06,511
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1742
01:56:06,887 --> 01:56:09,598
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1743
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:12,142
then install them all as his puppets.

1744
01:56:12,225 --> 01:56:14,770
You think this goddamn election matters?

1745
01:56:16,396 --> 01:56:18,315
Falcone's the mayor.

1746
01:56:19,274 --> 01:56:21,777
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1747
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:23,236
Come on, Vengeance.

1748
01:56:23,945 --> 01:56:25,781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1749

- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1754

we may never find the Riddler.

I have to stop her.

I'd like to come up?

He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1775

I could talk to you for a minute?

And I know
that you're a very important man.

1789

I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1798
01:59:21,415 --> 01:59:24,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

[officer] Police! Hands up!

1924
02:08:23,915 --> 02:08:27,419
[Gordon] He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1925
02:08:27,544 --> 02:08:29,254
[tense music continues]

1926
02:08:36,678 --> 02:08:37,721
[stool creaking]

1927
02:08:46,563 --> 02:08:48,482
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1928
02:08:51,443 --> 02:08:52,736
[Martinez] Stay still!

1929
02:08:52,819 --> 02:08:53,820
Now!

1930
02:08:55,864 --> 02:08:57,282
[handcuffs clicking]

1931
02:09:00,744 --> 02:09:02,370
[tense music continues]

1932
02:09:22,474 --> 02:09:24,267
[Martinez] Which one is you?

1933
02:09:24,351 --> 02:09:25,852
[laughs gleefully] You tell me.

1934
02:09:26,686 --> 02:09:28,146
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1935
02:09:31,233 --> 02:09:32,984
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1936
02:09:33,402 --> 02:09:35,153
[eerie music playing]

1937
02:09:41,576 --> 02:09:43,078
[siren wailing in distance]

1938
02:09:47,499 --> 02:09:50,419
[newscaster] <i>...where even murdered

Hey.

02:10:00,011 --> 02:10:01,555
[suspenseful music playing]

1943
02:10:21,324 --> 02:10:23,034
What are all these diaries?

1944
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:25,537
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1945
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:29,166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1946
02:10:29,249 --> 02:10:30,792
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1947
02:10:30,876 --> 02:10:33,170
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1948
02:10:33,253 --> 02:10:35,088
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1949
02:10:35,172 --> 02:10:37,591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1950
02:10:37,674 --> 02:10:39,426
What about chain of evidence?

1951
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:41,470
You should see this.

1952
02:10:47,434 --> 02:10:48,935
He's wearing gloves.

1953
02:10:50,395 --> 02:10:52,647
"Friday, July 16th.

1954
02:10:52,731 --> 02:10:56,443
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1955
02:10:56,777 --> 02:10:59,821
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1956
02:10:59,905 --> 02:11:01,323
But then, today, I saw it.

1957
02:11:01,406 --> 02:11:05,535
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1958
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:08,663
'Renewal.'

1959
02:11:08,747 --> 02:11:13,168
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1960
02:11:13,251 --> 02:11:16,379
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1961
02:11:16,463 --> 02:11:19,800
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1962
02:11:19,883 --> 02:11:22,344
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1963
02:11:22,427 --> 02:11:25,430
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1964
02:11:26,556 --> 02:11:28,391
- [rats squeaking]
- "If you want people to understand,

1965
02:11:28,475 --> 02:11:30,310
really understand,

02:11:30,393 --> 02:11:32,687
you can't just give them the answers.

1967
02:11:32,771 --> 02:11:34,231
You have to confront them,

1968
02:11:34,314 --> 02:11:36,733
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1969
02:11:36,817 --> 02:11:38,985
just like they tortured me.

1970
02:11:39,069 --> 02:11:41,863
I know now what I must become."

1971
02:11:44,825 --> 02:11:46,159

[bat screeching]

1973
02:11:52,249 --> 02:11:54,209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1974
02:11:54,751 --> 02:11:56,253
This one's not a rat.

1975
02:11:56,670 --> 02:11:58,672
- [rat continues squeaking]
- [cages rattling]

1976
02:12:02,884 --> 02:12:03,927
[screeching violently]

1977
02:12:12,894 --> 02:12:14,020
[Gordon] What is that?

1978
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:18,233
[bat screeching frantically]

1979
02:12:45,635 --> 02:12:46,845
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1980
02:12:46,928 --> 02:12:48,305
Is it a chisel?

1981
02:12:48,388 --> 02:12:49,848
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1982
02:12:49,931 --> 02:12:51,308
He killed Mitchell with it.

1983
02:12:51,975 --> 02:12:54,853
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1984
02:13:03,445 --> 02:13:05,447
"My confession"?

1985
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:08,408
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1986
02:13:08,492 --> 02:13:09,868
This isn't over.

1987
02:13:09,951 --> 02:13:12,370
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1988
02:13:12,788 --> 02:13:14,998
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1989
02:13:15,373 --> 02:13:16,666
[typing]

1990
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:25,300
His final post was last night.

1991
02:13:25,383 --> 02:13:28,595
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1992
02:13:28,678 --> 02:13:31,681
- [Gordon] Can you get in?
- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1993
02:13:31,807 --> 02:13:35,227
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1994
02:13:35,727 --> 02:13:37,312
[ominous music playing]

1995
02:13:46,571 --> 02:13:49,116
- [Gordon] Show me the post.
- [officer 2] It's right here.

1996
02:13:50,742 --> 02:13:52,452
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1997
02:13:53,286 --> 02:13:54,913
I think I'm his last target.

1998
02:13:57,499 --> 02:13:58,583
You?

1999
02:13:58,959 --> 02:14:01,002
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

2000
02:14:01,545 --> 02:14:02,921
What is?

2001
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:04,798
The Batman.

2002
02:14:05,048 --> 02:14:06,216
[cell phone ringing]

2003
02:14:10,178 --> 02:14:11,346
Yeah?

2004
02:14:22,649 --> 02:14:23,859
Right.

2005
02:14:26,737 --> 02:14:30,699
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2006
02:14:38,165 --> 02:14:39,666
You're a good cop.

2007
02:15:04,274 --> 02:15:06,651
[over speaker]
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

2008
02:15:07,402 --> 02:15:09,237
[Batman] <i>What do you want from me?</i>

2009
02:15:09,321 --> 02:15:10,864
[Riddler] "Want"?

2010
02:15:11,448 --> 02:15:15,077
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

2011
02:15:16,286 --> 02:15:17,621
<i>For this moment.</i>

2012
02:15:18,663 --> 02:15:21,666
I've been invisible my whole life.

2013
02:15:22,751 --> 02:15:25,378
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

2014
02:15:26,922 --> 02:15:29,341
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

2015
02:15:29,424 --> 02:15:31,259
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

2016
02:15:41,645 --> 02:15:43,605
<i>Bruce...</i>

2017
02:15:46,483 --> 02:15:48,318
<i>Wayne.</i>

[slowly] Bruce...

2019
02:15:55,867 --> 02:15:58,745
<i>Wayne.</i>

[exhales deeply]

2021
02:16:10,006 --> 02:16:12,426
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

2022
02:16:15,011 --> 02:16:18,390
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

2023
02:16:18,473 --> 02:16:20,851
<i>made all those promises.</i>

2024
02:16:23,311 --> 02:16:27,566
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

2025
02:16:28,108 --> 02:16:31,653
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

2026
02:16:31,737 --> 02:16:35,407
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

2027
02:16:35,991 --> 02:16:37,534
<i>Orphan.</i>

2028
02:16:43,206 --> 02:16:48,336
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

2029
02:16:49,629 --> 02:16:54,259
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

2030
02:16:54,926 --> 02:16:56,470
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

2031
02:16:59,097 --> 02:17:01,767
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2032
02:17:02,142 --> 02:17:04,728
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

2033
02:17:06,021 --> 02:17:10,067
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

2034
02:17:11,777 --> 02:17:16,448
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

2035
02:17:17,616 --> 02:17:20,786
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

2036
02:17:20,869 --> 02:17:23,163
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

2037
02:17:24,456 --> 02:17:27,042
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

2038
02:17:28,335 --> 02:17:29,586
[smacks lips]

2039
02:17:29,961 --> 02:17:33,131
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

2040
02:17:33,215 --> 02:17:36,134
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

2041
02:17:36,218 --> 02:17:37,219
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

2042
02:17:38,678 --> 02:17:40,722
<i>Bruce...</i>

2043
02:17:41,765 --> 02:17:43,683
<i>Wayne.</i>

2044
02:17:47,354 --> 02:17:50,440
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

2045
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:56,988
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

2046
02:17:58,448 --> 02:18:02,327
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

2047
02:18:05,497 --> 02:18:06,665
<i>God.</i>

2048
02:18:07,666 --> 02:18:08,959
<i>Look at you.</i>

2049
02:18:10,627 --> 02:18:13,088
Your mask is amazing.

2050
02:18:13,171 --> 02:18:16,091
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2051
02:18:16,174 --> 02:18:17,259
Ain't it funny?

2052
02:18:17,342 --> 02:18:21,763
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

2053
02:18:23,223 --> 02:18:25,267
<i>You and I both know</i>

2054
02:18:26,226 --> 02:18:28,728
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2055
02:18:28,812 --> 02:18:32,441
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2056
02:18:32,524 --> 02:18:34,067
<i>No shame,</i>

2057
02:18:34,985 --> 02:18:35,986
<i>no limits.</i>

2058
02:18:36,069 --> 02:18:37,738
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

2059
02:18:38,613 --> 02:18:39,614
<i>What do you mean?</i>

2060
02:18:39,698 --> 02:18:41,408
<i>All those cards.</i>

2061
02:18:41,491 --> 02:18:42,701
<i>I told you,</i>

2062
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:45,328
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

2063
02:18:45,412 --> 02:18:47,622
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

2064
02:18:47,706 --> 02:18:49,166
<i>What did we just do?</i>

2065
02:18:49,249 --> 02:18:51,251
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

2066
02:18:51,334 --> 02:18:52,502
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

2067
02:18:52,586 --> 02:18:53,587
<i>We're not a team.</i>

2068
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:56,173
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2069
02:18:56,256 --> 02:18:58,675
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

2070
02:18:58,759 --> 02:19:01,928
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

2071
02:19:02,012 --> 02:19:03,638
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2072
02:19:03,722 --> 02:19:04,931
You gave me that.

2073
02:19:05,015 --> 02:19:06,141
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

2074
02:19:06,224 --> 02:19:08,810
You showed me what was possible.

2075
02:19:08,894 --> 02:19:13,774
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

2076
02:19:13,857 --> 02:19:15,400
<i>You inspired me.</i>

2077
02:19:15,484 --> 02:19:16,985
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

2078
02:19:18,111 --> 02:19:19,196
<i>What?</i>

2079
02:19:19,279 --> 02:19:21,448
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

2080
02:19:21,531 --> 02:19:22,908
<i>How can you say that?</i>

2081
02:19:22,991 --> 02:19:24,493
You think you'll be remembered?

2082
02:19:24,576 --> 02:19:26,244
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

2083
02:19:26,745 --> 02:19:28,497
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

2084
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:30,248
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

2085
02:19:30,332 --> 02:19:31,374
<i>No, no!</i>

2086
02:19:31,458 --> 02:19:32,375
<i>A nobody!</i>

2087
02:19:34,169 --> 02:19:35,962
<i>No!</i>

2088
02:19:37,881 --> 02:19:40,258
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2089
02:19:40,509 --> 02:19:43,095
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

2090
02:19:44,054 --> 02:19:47,682
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2091
02:19:47,766 --> 02:19:50,393
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

2092
02:19:51,394 --> 02:19:53,396
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

2093
02:19:53,772 --> 02:19:57,067
