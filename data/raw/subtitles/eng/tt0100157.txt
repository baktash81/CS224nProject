00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,112
(typing)

2
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,538
Still got it.

3
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:07,377
(* "Shotgun" by Junior Walker
and the Allstars)

4
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,309
* I said shotgun

5
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,480
* Shoot 'em 'fore they run now

6
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,568
* Do the jerk, baby

7
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,655
* Do the dirty now

8
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,743
* Put on your red dress

9
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,496
* And then you go downtown now

10
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,500
* I said buy yourself a shotgun now

11
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,421
* We're gonna break it down, baby, now

12
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,675
* We're gonna load it up, baby, now

13
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,929
* Oh, can you shoot 'em
'fore they run now

14
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,308
* I said shotgun

15
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,687
* Shoot 'em 'fore they run now

16
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,316
* Do the jerk, baby

17
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,278
* Do the dirty now

18
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,741
* Put on your high-heel shoes

19
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,412
* I said we're going down here
listen to 'em play the blues

20
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,457
* We're gonna dig potatoes

21
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,419
* We're gonna pick tomatoes

22
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,131
* I said shotgun

23
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,260
* Shoot 'em 'fore they run now

24
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,098
* Do the jerk, baby

25
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,102
* Do the dirty now

26
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,313
* I said it's twine time...

27
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,233
(revs engine)

28
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,276
(woman)
What's that?

29
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,737
An old friend.

30
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,034
I was rummaging through a closet
and it was just sitting there.

31
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,787
It's nice, Paul.
It's got character.

32
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,415
When I wrote my first book
I carried it in this...

33
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,667
..while I was looking for a publisher.

34
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,837
- I was a writer then.
- You're still a writer.

35
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,715
Haven't been a writer
since I got in the Misery business.

36
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,178
It's not a bad business.
And it would still be growing, too.

37
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:08,433
The first printing for Misery's Child
was the most ever.
Over a million.

38
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,393
Marcia, please.

39
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,397
Misery Chastain is putting
your daughter through college,...

40
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,858
..bought you two houses
and seats to the Knicks.

41
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,486
What thanks does she get?
You go and kill her!

42
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,073
I never meant for it to become my life.

43
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,369
If I hadn't gotten rid of her now,
I'd have ended up writing her for ever.

44
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,664
Now I'm leaving for Colorado
to try to finish the new book.

45
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:37,212
If I can make this work...
I might just have something
I want on my tombstone.

46
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,307
(thud)

47
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,264
(groans)

48
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,462
(distorted woman's voice)
I'm your number one fan.

49
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,381
There's nothing to worry about.

50
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,927
You're gonna bejust fine.
I'll take good care ofyou.

51
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,598
I'm your number one fan.

52
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,525
Where...

53
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,987
We're just outside Silver Creek.

54
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,575
How long?

55
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,371
You've been here two days.
You're gonna be OK.

56
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,584
- My name is Annie Wilkes.
- My number one fan.

57
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,963
Yes. That's right.
I'm also a nurse.

58
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,843
Here, take these.

59
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,793
Here.

60
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,756
- What are they?
- They're called Novril. For your pain.

61
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,687
Thank you.

62
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,946
How come I'm not in the hospital?

63
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,575
The blizzard was too strong.
I couldn't risk trying to get you there.

64
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,327
I tried calling,
but the phone lines are down.

65
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,246
I...
Agh...

66
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,000
You mustn't tire yourself.
You've gotta rest.

67
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,545
You almost died.

68
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,725
Open wide.

69
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,271
(groans)

70
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,109
Your legs just sing grand opera
when you move, don't they?

71
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,196
It's not gonna hurt for ever, Paul,
I promise you.

72
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,533
- Will I be able to walk?
- Of course you will.

73
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,119
And your arm will be fine, too.

74
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,372
Your shoulder was badly dislocated.

75
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,750
It was a little stubborn,
but I finally popped it back in.

76
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,753
What l'm most proud of
is the work l did on those legs.

77
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:52,801
Considering what I had in the house,
I don't think a doctor could've done better.

78
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,764
It's not nearly as bad as it looks.

79
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,934
You have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs.

80
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,104
The fibula in the right leg
is fractured, too.

81
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,525
I could hear the bones moving, so it's best
for your legs to remain immobile.

82
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,071
And as soon as the roads open,
I'll take you to a hospital.

83
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,116
Meantime, you've got
a lot of recovering to do,...

84
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,328
..and I consider it an honour
that you'll do it in my home.

85
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,505
This is Marcia Sindell,
calling from New York City.

86
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,675
I'd like to speak to the Silver Creek
chief of police or sheriff.

87
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,386
- Which one do you want?
- Whichever one's not busy.

88
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,182
Well, I'm pretty sure they're both not
busy, Miz Sindell, since they're both me.

89
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:45,937
I also happen to be president of
the Policeman's Benefit Association,...

90
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,565
..chairman of the Patrolman's
Retirement Fund,...

91
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,318
..and if you need a good fishing guide
you could do a lot worse.

92
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,738
Call me Buster.
Everybody does.

93
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,656
What can I do for ya?

94
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,452
I'm a literary agent and I...
I feel like a fool calling you,...

95
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:06,166
..but I think one of my clients, Paul
Sheldon, may be in some kind of trouble.

96
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,627
- You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
- Uh-huh.

97
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,088
- He's your client, huh?
- Yes, he is.

98
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,966
Well, everybody sure likes
those Misery books.

99
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,426
Yeah.

100
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:21,389
Paul's been coming to the Silver Creek
Lodge for years to finish his books.

101
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,309
I understand he's been up here
the last six weeks.

102
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,937
Well, not quite.
I just called there.

103
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:33,360
They said he checked out last Tuesday.
Isn't that a little strange?

104
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:37,614
I don't know.
Does he usually phone you
before he checks out of a hotel?

105
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,619
No. No, of course not.
It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him...

106
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,539
..and when he has a new book
coming out he usually keeps in touch.

107
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,459
So when there wasn't
any word from him...

108
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,670
You think he might be missing, huh?

109
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,675
(sighs) I hate that I made this call.
Tell me I'm being silly.

110
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:02,430
Oh, a little overprotective maybe, but...
Tell you what I'll do.

111
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,852
Nothing's been reported out here,
but I'll put his name through our system.

112
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,690
If anything turns up,
I'll call you right back.

113
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,109
I appreciate that.
Thanks a lot.

114
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,486
Goodbye, Miz Sindell.

115
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,240
We got a phone call?
Busy morning.

116
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,867
Yeah.
Work, work, work.

117
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,787
Virginia, when was that blizzard?

118
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,290
Last Tuesday.
Why?

119
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,252
No reason.

120
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,681
I guess it was kind of a miracle
you finding me.

121
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,307
(chuckles)

122
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,852
No, it wasn't a miracle at all.

123
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,106
- In a way, I was following you.
- You were following me?

124
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,443
Well, it was no secret to me
you were staying at the Silver Creek,...

125
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,946
..seeing as how
I'm your number one fan an' all.

126
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,074
Some nights I'd just tool on
down there and sit outside...

127
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,369
..and look up at the light in your cabin.

128
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,540
I'd try to imagine what was going on
in the room of the world's greatest writer.

129
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,877
- Say that again, I didn't hear you.
- Don't move now.

130
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,504
I wouldn't wanna hurt this neck.

131
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,885
Well, the other afternoon
I was on my way home...

132
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,721
..and there you were, leaving the lodge.

133
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:29,601
I wondered why a literary genius would
go for a drive with a big storm coming.

134
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,437
I didn't know there
was a big storm coming.

135
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,441
Well, lucky for you I did.
Lucky for me, too,...

136
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,070
..cos now you're alive
and you can write more books.

137
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,490
Oh, Paul, I've read everything of yours.

138
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,326
The Misery novels -
I know 'em all by heart.

139
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,829
All eight of 'em.
I love them so.

140
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,958
- Well, you're very kind.
- And you're very brilliant.

141
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,712
Like a baby.
All done.

142
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,006
Thank you.

143
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,677
When do you think the phone lines'll be up?
I have to call my daughter,...

144
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,180
..and I'd like to call my agent
and let her know I'm still breathing.

145
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,182
It shouldn't be much longer.

146
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,477
Once the roads are open,
the phone lines'll be up in no time.

147
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,979
If you give me their numbers
I'll keep trying.

148
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,148
Thank you.

149
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,652
Could I ask you a favour?

150
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:27,242
I noticed in your case
there's a new Paul Sheldon book.

151
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,411
l wondered if maybe...

152
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,665
- You want to read it?
- Well, if you wouldn't mind.

153
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,712
I do have a hard-and-fast rule as to
who reads my stuff at this early stage.

154
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,631
Only my editor, my agent,...

155
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,385
..and anybody that saves me
from freezing to death in a car wreck.

156
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,730
You'll never realise
what a rare treat you've given me.

157
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,690
(groans)

158
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,944
Boy, it's like clockwork
the way your pain comes.

159
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,199
I'll get the Novril.
Forgive me for prattling
away and making you feel all oogy.

160
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,248
What's your new book called?

161
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,625
I don't have a title yet.

162
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,836
What's it about?

163
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,297
I don't know.

164
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:27,469
I know it sounds crazy, but I haven't
written anything but Misery for so long...

165
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:32,307
Why don't you read it?
You can tell me what you think it's about.

166
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,518
Maybe you can come up with a title.

167
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,812
Like I could do that!

168
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,985
(man) There's nothing unusual
about Mr Sheldon's leaving, Buster.

169
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,322
- You can tell by the champagne.
- Maybe you can, Libby.

170
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,326
See, he always orders a bottle
of Dom Pérignon when he's ready to go.

171
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,536
Then he pays up and he's out the door.

172
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:58,041
No long-distance phone calls
or Federal Express packages?

173
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,460
Anything out of the ordinary?

174
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,090
I don't think Mr Sheldon likes
for things to be out of the ordinary.

175
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:11,346
Considering who he is, famous an' all,
he doesn't put on airs.

176
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:16,726
Drives up from New York
in the same car each time, '65 Mustang.

177
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,312
He says it helps him to think.

178
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:24,609
He's always been a good guest.
Never makes a noise, never bothers a soul.

179
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,738
- I sure hope nothing's happened to him.
- So do I.

180
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,660
I bet that old Mustang's
pulling into New York right now.

181
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,162
I'm sure you're right.
Thanks, Libby.

182
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,248
My pleasure.

183
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,181
I know I'm only 40 pages
into your book, but...

184
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,144
But what?

185
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,815
- Nothing.
- No, no... What is it?

186
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:09,571
Well, it's ridiculous.
Who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?

187
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,990
It's all right, I can take it.

188
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,997
Well, it's brilliantly written...
But then everything you write is brilliant.

189
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,166
Pretty rough so far.

190
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,919
The swearing, Paul.

191
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,798
There, I said it.

192
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,385
The, uh... the profanity bothers you?

193
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,013
It has no nobility.

194
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:41,019
These are slum kids.
I was a slum kid.
Everybody talks like that.

195
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,690
They do not!
What do you think I say
when I go to the feed store in town?

196
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:52,072
"Wally, give me a bag of that effing pig
feed and 10lb of that bitchly cow corn!"

197
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:56,743
And in the bank do I tell Mrs Bollinger
"Here's one big bastard of a cheque,...

198
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,953
..give me some Christing money!"

199
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,624
There!
Look there!
See what you made me do?

200
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,422
Oh, Paul, I'm sorry.

201
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,175
I'm so sorry.

202
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,261
Oh...

203
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,726
Sometimes I get so worked up.
Can you ever forgive me?

204
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,021
It's... fine.

205
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,737
I love you, Paul.

206
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:41,037
Your mind.
Your creativity.
That's all I meant.

207
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,621
Well, this sure is fun.

208
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:39,471
Virginia, when you're in this car
you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

209
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,518
Well, this deputy'd rather be home
under the covers with the sheriff.

210
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,481
- Stop. Stop!
- What?

211
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:04,662
- See that broken limb?
- Could've been the weight of the snow.

212
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:09,834
Yeah.
Could've been a rotten branch,
the wind, could've been a lot of things.

213
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,783
Oh...

214
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,452
Damn!

215
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,163
Need some help?

216
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,334
No, I'm enjoying myself!
Thank you.

217
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:17,986
- You really think Sheldon's out there?
- I hope not.
If he is, he's dead.

218
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,573
Let's go to the newspaper office.

219
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,524
Oh, I hope I didn't wake you.

220
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,569
No, that's fine.

221
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:06,618
Look what I got.
They had it at the store, Paul.
There was a whole batch of 'em.

222
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,955
As soon as I saw it I slammed
my money down - I got the first copy.

223
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,876
- Then the roads are open.
- The one to town is, but that's about it.

224
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,797
I called the hospital and talked
to the head orthopaedic surgeon...

225
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,050
..and I told him who you were
and what had happened.

226
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:26,930
He said as long as there's no infection
you're not in any danger.

227
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:31,726
As soon as the road to the hospital is
open they'll send an ambulance for you.

228
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,229
The phones are working?

229
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:40,443
Well, mine's still out, but the ones in town
were working fine.
I called your agent.

230
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:45,615
Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.
What a wonderful first page.

231
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,993
- Just to read the name Misery Chastain...
- My daughter will be going nuts.

232
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,249
- It's like a visit from my dearest friend.
- I should be home for her birthday today.

233
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,003
The agent said she'd tell her you're OK,...

234
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,757
..but you'll have to wait till tomorrow
to talk to her yourself.

235
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,180
Oh, Paul...
What a poet you are.

236
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,694
I made you my specialty,
scrambled eggs à la Wilkes.

237
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,405
And I'm on page 75.

238
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,742
I guess that means it's OK.

239
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,452
No.

240
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,621
No, it isn't, it's...

241
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:39,085
Oh, pooh, I can't think of any words.
Would "great" be insulting?

242
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,547
I can live with great.

243
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:46,885
No...
It's not just great, it's...

244
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,096
..perfect.

245
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,642
A perfect, perfect thing.

246
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,303
(grunting)

247
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,693
I thought it was time
you two should meet.

248
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:50,573
Paul, say hello to my favourite beast
in the whole world - my sow Misery.

249
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,118
Misery?

250
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,912
Yes.
I told you I was your number one fan.

251
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,249
Yeah, I'm, uh... starting to believe you.

252
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:03,420
This farm was kind of dreary, what with
just a few cows and chickens and me.

253
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:09,175
But when I got Misery here everything changed.
She just makes me smile so.

254
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,138
She's a fine, uh...
pig, is what she is.

255
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm on page 300 now, Paul,...

256
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,147
..and it's better than perfect.
It's divine.

257
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,608
What's the ceiling that dago painted?

258
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:31,197
- The Sistine Chapel.
- Yeah!
That and Misery's Child,...

259
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:35,410
..those are the only two divine
things ever in this world!

260
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,246
(snorts)

261
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,931
When my husband left me,
I wasn't prepared.

262
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,934
It wasn't an easy time.

263
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,564
For a while I thought I might go crazy.

264
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,817
Yeah, I know how that can be.

265
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:15,075
I don't know about you, but what I did
to get through it was I dove into work.

266
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,078
Days, nights...

267
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:24,501
Night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital.
I did a lot of reading.

268
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,214
That was when I first discovered Misery.

269
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:34,928
She made me so happy.
She made me forget all my problems.

270
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,225
Course, I suppose you had
a little something to do with that, too.

271
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,394
Yeah, well...

272
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,982
I just kept reading them over and over.

273
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,527
I've got two chapters to go on this one...

274
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:56,324
..and when I finish I'll turn right to the first
page and start reading it all over again.

275
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,993
I'm, uh...

276
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,707
- Done?
- Yeah.

277
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,875
No problem.

278
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,712
Thanks.

279
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:12,132
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not against marriage per se,...

280
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:17,137
..but it'd take a pretty special guy to make
me wanna walk down that aisle again.

281
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:21,099
Yeah, it's, uh, not something
you should enter into lightly.

282
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,476
It boils down to respect.

283
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,896
People just don't respect
the institution of marriage any more.

284
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,400
They have no sense of real commitment.

285
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,571
Well, I'd love to stay here and chat,...

286
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,575
..but I'm right at the end
and I gotta find out what happens.

287
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:58,261
(door opens and closes)

288
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,849
You...

289
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:09,105
You dirty bird... How could you?

290
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:16,112
She can't be dead!
Misery Chastain cannot be dead!

291
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:20,200
Annie, in 1871
women often died in childbirth.

292
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,204
Her spirit is the important thing.
Misery's spirit is still alive.

293
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,916
I don't want her spirit!
I want her!

294
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,210
And you murdered her!

295
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,754
No...
I didn't.

296
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,464
Who did?

297
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:38,468
No one.
She... she died, she just slipped away.

298
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:42,806
Slipped away?
Slipped away?

299
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,725
She didn't just slip away!
You did it!

300
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,938
You did it!
You did it!

301
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:54,025
You did it!
You did it!
You murdered my Misery!

302
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,402
Annie...

303
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,909
I thought you were good, Paul.

304
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:08,039
But you're not good.
You're just another lying old dirty birdie.

305
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:12,085
And I don't think I better
be around you for a while.

306
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,346
And don't even think
about anybody coming for you.

307
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:30,562
Not the doctors, not your agent, not
your family, because I never called them.

308
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,023
Nobody knows you're here.

309
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,109
And you better hope
nothing happens to me.

310
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,363
Because if I die...
you die.

311
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,660
(door closes)

312
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,540
(another door closes)

313
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,176
(engine starts)

314
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,439
Agh!

315
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,807
No, Miz Sindell, there's no point
in coming up here now.

316
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,518
Everything that can be done is.

317
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:21,441
Yes, we're working close with the state
police and the FBI's been informed.

318
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:26,446
Right. Right.
As soon as we know anything,
we'll let you know.

319
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:31,201
No bother at all.
Call any time.
Bye, Miz Sindell.

320
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,830
All right.
Well, I sure appreciate it.
Thank you.

321
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:43,338
According to Sheldon's credit charges,
there's nothing after the Silver Creek.

322
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,174
And no calls about the article, either.

323
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:54,516
You poor, dear thing.
What are you doing on the floor?

324
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,227
It's all my fault.

325
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:01,064
If I'd had a proper hospital bed
this never would've happened.

326
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,982
Here, let me help you back in.

327
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:05,151
(Paul groans)

328
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:10,699
I know this hurts,
but it'll only take a few seconds.

329
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,785
Upsy-daisy!

330
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,456
Oh...
Ow...

331
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:23,044
- Oh, please, wait, wait...
- Oh, you're such a crybaby.

332
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,883
Agh...

333
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,679
There you go.
Comfy?

334
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,391
- Perfect.
- You're such a kidder.

335
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:41,396
I have a big surprise for you.
But first there's something you must do.

336
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,860
You don't suppose I could have a little
snack while I'm waiting for the surprise?

337
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:51,114
I'll get you everything you want,
but you must listen first.

338
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,826
Sometimes my thinking
is a little muddy, I accept that.

339
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,623
It's why I couldn't remember all they
asked me on the witness stand in Denver.

340
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,917
But this time I thought clearly.

341
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,669
I asked God about you,...

342
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:09,049
..and God said "I delivered him unto you
so that you may show him the way."

343
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,886
- Show me the way?
- Yes.

344
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:51,633
When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking
more on the lines of cheese and crackers.

345
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,011
Paul, this is no time for jokes.

346
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,681
You must rid the world of this filth.

347
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,310
You want me to burn my book?

348
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:06,648
I know this may be difficult for you,
but it's for the best.

349
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,153
It's really not difficult at all.

350
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:16,449
My agent made dozens of copies.
There's gonna be an auction in New York.

351
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:19,160
Every publishing house in New York
is reading it now.

352
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:24,958
So if you want me to burn my book, fine.
You're not ridding the world of anything.

353
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,335
Then light the match, Paul.

354
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,879
It's no big deal.

355
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,550
So you've indicated.
Do it.

356
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,188
I know it's the only copy.
When you wrote your first book
you didn't make a copy...

357
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,442
..because you didn't think anybody
would take it seriously.

358
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,528
Now you never make copies
because you're superstitious.

359
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,947
It's why you always
come back to Silver Creek.

360
00:35:56,114 --> 00:36:00,285
You told that story to Merv Griffin
11 years ago.

361
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,372
Merv Griffin...

362
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:11,713
I'll tell you what.
It doesn't ever have to be published.
No one ever has to read it.

363
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,009
I'll just keep it for myself.
No one will even know it exists.

364
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:21,056
As long as it does exist,
your mind won't ever be free.

365
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,854
I think you should light the match, Paul.

366
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,240
Can't you see it's what God wants?

367
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:44,037
You're so brilliant I would think
you'd certainly be able to see that.

368
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:49,459
We're put on this earth
to help people, Paul.

369
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,379
Like I'm trying to help you.

370
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:57,509
Please...
help me help you.

371
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,029
You're doing the right thing.

372
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:31,334
Oh, my goodness!
Goodness gracious!
Oh, my...

373
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:38,299
Oh, goodness!
Heavens to Betsy!

374
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,928
Oh, goodness!
Oh, my goodness!

375
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,850
Heavens to Betsy!
Oh, goodness!

376
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,663
Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

377
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:17,422
(helicopter)

378
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,937
That's the Steadman place down there.

379
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,399
And that's the Wilkes farm straight ahead.

380
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:41,780
That's no '65 Mustang.

381
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:47,202
There's nothing else out this way.
Let's circle back.

382
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:03,802
I do believe the winters are getting
shorter and shorter every year.

383
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:09,015
People say it has something to do
with the ozone layer.
What do you think?

384
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,227
I don't know.

385
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,271
Yeah, well, it's a theory.

386
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,573
Here's your Novril.

387
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,948
We're back.
Now, you'll have to remind us
who the audience chose.

388
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,950
They chose Kevin.

389
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,286
Congratulations, Kevin Andrews!

390
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,496
- Hi, Kevin.
- How you doing, Chuck?

391
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:17,667
Make yourselfat home back there,
and Sheree will tell us about the date.

392
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:21,629
OK, first ofall I picked out
a very classy restaurant.

393
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:26,092
It was so classy,
and he shows up without no tie...

394
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,820
See, isn't this nice?

395
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:30,448
Great.
Ialways wanted to visit
the other side of the room.

396
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:33,201
Ooh, and look what I got for you.

397
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:38,540
An electric razor,
so you can shave yourself now.

398
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,084
(razor buzzes)

399
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,547
If I knew this was the surprise
I'd have burned all my books.

400
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,258
Now, don't poke fun!

401
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:54,597
This is a very big day for you, Paul.
You just sit tight and I'll set everything up.

402
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:58,727
- Set what up?
- That's the big surprise.

403
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,271
Your new studio.

404
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:05,608
After all, writers do need a place to work.

405
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:08,361
Work?
You mean write?

406
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,574
What in the world do you think I'd write?

407
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:16,244
Oh, but, Paul, I don't think.
I know.

408
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:19,330
Now you've gotten rid
of that manuscript,...

409
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:22,334
..you can go back
to doing what you're great at.

410
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,212
You're gonna write a new novel,
your greatest achievement ever.

411
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,715
Misery's Return.

412
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:31,301
Misery's Return?

413
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:36,306
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her,
and now you'll make it right.

414
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:43,104
It'll be a book in my honour,
for saving your life and nursing you back to health.

415
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:48,068
Oh, Paul, you're gonna make me
the envy of the whole world!

416
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:51,279
You just expect me to whip
something off, is that it?

417
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,908
I expect nothing less
than your masterpiece.

418
00:42:56,826 --> 00:43:01,956
You do understand that this is not the
ordinary way in which books get written.

419
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:05,835
I mean, some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation.

420
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,341
I have total confidence in your brilliance.
Besides, the view will inspire you.

421
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:14,344
You just inhale that.
I'll be right back.

422
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,817
I guess you don't get bothered
by neighbours much.

423
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:34,364
Don't worry, you'll have total solitude
so you can concentrate on your work.

424
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:36,449
Great.

425
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,328
I got you this expensive
paper to type on,...

426
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:44,791
..and I got a great deal on this 501b
clunker on account of it's missing an N.

427
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:49,087
I told the saleslady N was one of the
letters in my favourite writer's name.

428
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:57,220
It's two of the letters
in my favourite nurse's name, A-nn-ie.

429
00:43:57,345 --> 00:44:01,307
You fooler!
Did I do good?

430
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,643
You did great.

431
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:09,274
There is just one little thing.
Uh...

432
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:16,531
I can't work on this paper.
See, it's Corrasable Bond.
It smudges.

433
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:20,785
So I thought maybe,
if you went back into town,...

434
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,581
..you could bring me
some white long-grain mimeo.

435
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:29,961
But mine cost the most,
so I don't see how it can smudge.

436
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:33,381
Come here, I'll show you.

437
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,446
Oh...
It does smudge after all.
Isn't that fascinating.

438
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,907
I thought you'd be interested.

439
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:01,534
I'd like for you to be
in on everything, Annie,...

440
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:05,455
..not just the finished book,
but how it's written.

441
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:08,625
Thank you for thinking of me.

442
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:15,340
Anything else I can get while l'm in town?

443
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:19,010
Any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying?

444
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,304
Would you like a tiny tape recorder?

445
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:24,557
Or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers?

446
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,435
No, just the paper will be fine.

447
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,231
Are you sure?
Cos if you want I'll bring back
the whole store for you.

448
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:35,402
Annie, uh, what's the matter?

449
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:37,946
I'll tell you what's the matter!

450
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:41,533
I go out of my way for you!
I do everything to try and make you happy!

451
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,453
I feed you, I clean you, I dress you,
and what thanks do I get?

452
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:49,124
"Oh, you bought the wrong paper, Annie.
I can't write on this, Annie!"

453
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:51,960
Well, I'll get your stupid paper,
but you better show me...

454
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,629
..a little more appreciation, Mister Man!

455
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,215
Agh!

456
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,344
(locks door)

457
00:47:23,885 --> 00:47:25,720
Shit.

458
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,366
Come on...

459
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:50,203
Come on, you've written
about this, now do it.

460
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:52,205
(click)

461
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:01,464
What do you know?
It actually works.

462
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,039
What a surprise.

463
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:16,247
You crazy bitch.

464
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,124
Agh!

465
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,437
(car approaches)

466
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:38,653
(click)

467
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,951
Paul, I've got your paper.

468
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:49,581
I hope it's enough.
It's three reams of long-grain mimeo.

469
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:52,125
Just the kind you asked for.

470
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:56,880
Paul!
You're dripping with perspiration.

471
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:01,009
Your colour is very hectic.
What have you been doing?

472
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:06,097
You know damn well what I've been doing.
I've been sitting here suffering.

473
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:08,516
I need my pills.

474
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:12,437
Poor dear.
Let's get you back in bed
and I'll get them for you.

475
00:55:12,562 --> 00:55:14,147
I want my pills now!

476
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,983
- It'll only take a second.
- No!

477
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:20,862
I want my pain to go away, Annie.

478
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:24,866
Please, make it go away.

479
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,411
Please, Annie.

480
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,663
Please.

481
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,544
It just breaks my heart to see you like this.

482
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:50,558
I've done a lot of thinking on the drive...
Here you go.

483
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:55,271
And I'm absolutely certain the main
reason I've never been more popular...

484
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:57,524
..is because of my temper.

485
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:01,444
You must be so mad at me.
The truth now.

486
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:07,450
Well...
Who doesn't let off
a little steam every once in a while?

487
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,080
My genius needs his rest before he writes.

488
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,125
(hums)

489
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:19,587
Footsies up.

490
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,507
There you go.

491
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:39,107
Here.
In case you think of any ideas.

492
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:42,610
Well, I wouldn't expect too much.

493
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:48,825
Don't be silly!
You'll be brilliant.
Think of me as your inspiration.

494
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:56,041
I have faith in you, my darling.

495
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:58,168
Catch this...

496
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,264
My darling.

497
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,758
The presumption must now be
that Paul Sheldon is dead.

498
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:49,969
We know he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle,...

499
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:54,307
..but we have been unable to find his body
in the vicinity of the accident.

500
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:58,770
We also know if anyone had found him
they'd have taken him to an area hospital.

501
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:02,482
Undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow.

502
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:04,651
We'll find him after the first thaw.

503
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:09,698
That is, unless the animals got to him
first, which is a distinct possibility.

504
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:15,161
That was a statement from Colorado
Police Chief Sherman Douglas.

505
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:27,173
You don't think he's dead, do you?

506
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,802
Well, he might well be,
but not the way they say.

507
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:33,638
He never crawled out
of that car by himself.

508
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:36,224
You can see the dents on the door there.

509
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:38,309
Someone pulled him out.

510
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:33,091
I'm sorry, Paul.
This is all wrong.

511
01:00:33,466 --> 01:00:35,885
- What?
- You'll have to do it over again.

512
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,722
It's not worthy of you.
Throw it all out.

513
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:43,476
Except for naming the gravedigger
after me - you can leave that in.

514
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:49,315
I really value your criticism,
but maybe we're being a little hasty here.

515
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,818
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.

516
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:54,279
- Not fair?
- That's right.

517
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:57,407
When I was growing up in Bakersfield
my favourite thing...

518
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,493
..was to go to the movies on Saturdays
for the chapter plays.

519
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:03,580
- Cliffhangers.
- I know that, Mister Man!

520
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:07,417
They also call them serials.
I'm not stupid, you know!

521
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:14,632
Anyway, my favourite was Rocket Man,
and once it was a no-brakes chapter.

522
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:18,428
The bad guys stuck him in a car
on a mountain road, knocked him out,...

523
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:20,847
..tore out the brakes
and started him to his death.

524
01:01:20,972 --> 01:01:23,683
And he woke up and tried to get out,...

525
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:27,354
..but the car went off a cliff before he
could escape, and crashed and burned,...

526
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:31,524
..and I was so upset and excited!
And the next week I was first in line.

527
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:33,860
They start with the end of the last week,...

528
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:37,906
..and there was Rocket Man trying
to get out, and here comes the cliff,...

529
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:43,286
..and just before the car went off the cliff
he jumped free, and all the kids cheered!

530
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:47,457
But I didn't cheer.
I stood right up and started shouting...

531
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:51,419
.."This isn't what happened last week!
Have you all got amnesia?"

532
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:59,010
"They just cheated us!
This isn't fair!
He didn't get out of the cockadoodie car!"

533
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:08,561
They always cheated like that
in cl... chapter plays.

534
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:12,899
But not you.
Not with my Misery.

535
01:02:13,024 --> 01:02:17,612
lan did ride for Dr Cleary at the end
of the last book, but his horse fell...

536
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:21,282
..and lan broke his shoulder and ribs
and never reached the doctor,...

537
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:25,912
..so there couldn't be any experimental
blood transfusion that saved her life.

538
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:31,251
Misery was buried in the ground at the
end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.

539
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:13,960
Is it fair?
Should I continue?

540
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:16,838
You better!

541
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:21,634
Oh, Paul!
When lan realised that
the reason they'd buried Misery alive...

542
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,429
..was because the bee sting
had put her in that coma!

543
01:03:24,554 --> 01:03:27,640
And Gravedigger Wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier...

544
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:30,268
..the same had happened
to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

545
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:35,065
And then Dr Cleary deduced that Misery
must be her long-lost daughter...

546
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:38,818
..because of the rarity of deadly
bee stings, my heart just leapt!

547
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:42,238
I knew from the very first book
that Misery had to be nobility...

548
01:03:42,405 --> 01:03:44,783
- ..and I was right!
- Yeah.

549
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:49,871
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter
when you're finished?
I can fill in the N's.

550
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:54,042
Will she be her old self now lan has
dug her out, or will she have amnesia?

551
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:55,377
Have to wait.

552
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:58,463
Will she still love him
with that special, perfect love?

553
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:01,424
- You'll have to wait.
- Not even a hint?

554
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:02,509
Mm-mm.

555
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:03,843
Ohhh!

556
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:08,598
Misery's alive, Misery's alive!
Oh, it's so romantic!

557
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:11,810
Oh, this whole house
is gonna be filled with romance!

558
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:14,270
I'm gonna put on my Liberace records!

559
01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:21,152
You do like Liberace, don't you?

560
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:25,407
Whenever he played Radio City,
who do you think was in the front row?

561
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:30,453
I'm gonna play my records all day long,
to inspire you.
He's my all-time favourite.

562
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:32,247
Annie?

563
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:39,587
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
To celebrate Misery's Return.

564
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:45,176
I couldn't have done it without you.

565
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,139
Oh, Paul...

566
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:52,892
It would be an honour.

567
01:04:59,524 --> 01:05:01,526
No, he's not here.

568
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,821
I don't know where he is.
He never tells me anything any more.

569
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:08,116
He's probably out
having an affair somewhere.

570
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:10,618
Wait a minute.
He's coming in now.

571
01:05:11,036 --> 01:05:15,290
It's Jim Taylor.
He wants to know
who you're having an affair with.

572
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:18,376
Hello, Jim.
What's doing?

573
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:23,214
Jim, we've been through this before.

574
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,884
If you have benches
in front of your store,...

575
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,762
..people are gonna want to sit on 'em.

576
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:34,768
Well, I don't like him either, but I'm not
gonna come over and tell him to move.

577
01:05:34,893 --> 01:05:37,604
Give my best to Denise.
Bye.

578
01:05:38,646 --> 01:05:42,317
Well, whoever she is,
she sure likes to read a lot.

579
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:48,031
Virginia, I'm flattered that
you think I've got that much energy.

580
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:52,035
I figured that if I can't find Paul Sheldon,...

581
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,205
..at least I can find out
what he wrote about.

582
01:05:55,330 --> 01:06:01,336
What d'you expect to find?
A story about a guy
who drove off a cliff in a storm?

583
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:08,259
You see, it's just that kind of sarcasm
that's given our marriage real spice.

584
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,641
(Liberace)
* I'll be seeing you

585
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:19,938
* In all the old familiar places...

586
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:25,777
- I hope you like it.
- It looks wonderful.

587
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,987
So do you.

588
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:55,473
Mm...

589
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:59,561
I've never had meatloaf this good.
What do you do to it?

590
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:02,981
My secret is I only use
fresh tomatoes, never canned.

591
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:06,985
And to give it that extra zip I mix in
some Spam with the ground beef.

592
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,611
Ah...

593
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:13,783
Can't get this in a restaurant in New York.

594
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:23,418
- Let's have a toast.
- A toast?

595
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:27,255
Yes.
To, um... to Misery.
Let me pour you some wine.

596
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:28,798
Oh...

597
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:32,427
Whoa...

598
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:34,179
No...

599
01:07:45,648 --> 01:07:47,692
To Misery.

600
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:54,908
Wait.
Let's do this right.
Do you have any candles?

601
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,452
Oh, um...

602
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:00,789
I don't know.
I...
I think so.

603
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:03,249
I'll go look.

604
01:08:10,256 --> 01:08:13,385
Did you study decorating
or do you just have a flair?

605
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:19,099
Oh, you!
I just picked things up over the years.

606
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,768
Well, it certainly says you.

607
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:25,814
- You really think so?
- Oh, absolutely.

608
01:08:26,731 --> 01:08:30,485
Listen, if you can't find any, it's OK.
I just thought it'd be nice.

609
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:34,406
Are you kidding?
If anyone had ever told me that one day...

610
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:38,410
..I'd be having a candlelit dinner
with Paul Sheldon in my own house,...

611
01:08:38,535 --> 01:08:42,997
..I woulda checked both legs
to see which one was being pulled!

612
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,334
Will this do?

613
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:48,712
It's perfect.

614
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:58,888
To Misery... and to Annie Wilkes,
who brought her back to life.

615
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:02,767
Oh, Paul!
I get goose bumps
every time I think about it!

616
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:05,103
Oh...

617
01:09:05,603 --> 01:09:09,482
Oh, my God, what have I done?
Oh, I'm so sorry, Paul!

618
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:12,652
I ruined your beautiful toast!

619
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:17,032
Will you ever forgive me?

620
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:19,993
Here, let me pour another one.

621
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:28,918
Can we pretend this never happened?

622
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:34,424
To Misery.

623
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:37,010
To Misery.

624
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:42,974
(* Tchaikovsky "Piano Concerto No. 1",
performed by Liberace)

627
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:24,766
Paul, this is positively
the best Misery you've ever written.

01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,068
(thunderclap)

629
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:35,628
Here's your pills.

630
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,256
Annie?

631
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,553
Annie, what is it?

632
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:46,848
The rain.

633
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:51,186
Sometimes it gives me the blues.

634
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:59,652
When you first came here...
I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon.

635
01:12:02,113 --> 01:12:05,075
But now I know I love the rest of him, too.

636
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:13,875
I know you don't love me.

637
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:17,045
Don't say you do.

638
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,676
You're a beautiful, brilliant,
famous man of the world...

639
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:27,931
..and I'm...
not a movie-star type.

640
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:37,816
You'll never know the fear
of losing someone like you...

641
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:40,402
..if you're someone like me.

642
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:43,571
Why would you lose me?

643
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:49,285
The book's almost finished.

644
01:12:51,287 --> 01:12:54,040
Your legs are getting better.

645
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,627
Soon you'll be wanting to leave.

646
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:01,548
Why would I leave?
I like it here.

647
01:13:02,173 --> 01:13:08,013
That's very kind of you,
but I'll bet it's not altogether true.

648
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:27,032
I have this gun.

649
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:33,663
Sometimes I think about using it.

650
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:42,297
I better go now.

651
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:47,177
I might put bullets in it.

652
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:40,438
"There is a justice higher than that of man.
I will be judged by him."

653
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:41,690
What?

654
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:44,359
They're hauling Misery into court.

655
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:47,487
That's nice.

656
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:59,499
There is a justice...
higher than that of man.

657
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:05,630
l will be judged...
by him.

658
01:17:58,928 --> 01:18:01,514
(car approaches)

659
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:25,705
(footsteps)

660
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:35,423
(front door opens)

661
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:06,871
(door closes)

662
01:19:08,623 --> 01:19:11,167
(TV on)

663
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:32,105
See you in the morning.

664
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:40,822
(rain)

665
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:23,365
(audience applause)

666
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:27,744
(Liberace)
I'm supposed to lead
into the finale of my show right now,...

667
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:30,622
..but I'm having such a wonderful time...

668
01:20:30,747 --> 01:20:32,791
Paul.

669
01:20:36,586 --> 01:20:37,837
Hm?

670
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:40,674
I know you've been out.

671
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:46,596
What?

672
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:49,516
You've been out of your room.

673
01:20:50,141 --> 01:20:52,018
No, I haven't.

674
01:20:52,143 --> 01:20:58,191
Paul, my little ceramic penguin
in the study always faces due south.

675
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:03,071
I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

676
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:05,782
Ceramic penguin?

677
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:09,327
Is this what you're looking for?

678
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:13,748
I know you've been out twice, Paul.

679
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:19,838
At first I couldn't figure out how you did it,
but last night...
I found your key.

680
01:21:22,882 --> 01:21:25,927
I know I left my scrapbook out.

681
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:28,471
I can imagine what
you might be thinking of me.

682
01:21:28,596 --> 01:21:31,266
But you see, Paul, it's all OK.

683
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:35,979
Last night it came so clear.
I realise you just need more time.

684
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:39,315
Eventually you'll come to accept
the idea of being here.

685
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:44,529
Paul, do you know about the early days
at the Kimberley diamond mines?

686
01:21:44,654 --> 01:21:48,324
Do you know what they did to
the native workers who stole diamonds?

687
01:21:48,491 --> 01:21:50,744
Don't worry.
They didn't kill them.

688
01:21:50,869 --> 01:21:54,622
That would be like junking a Mercedes
just because it had a broken spring.

689
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:58,001
No, they had to make sure
they could go on working,...

690
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:01,129
..but they also had to make sure
they could never run away.

691
01:22:01,254 --> 01:22:04,049
The operation was called "hobbling".

692
01:22:13,558 --> 01:22:19,731
Annie...
Whatever you're thinking about doing,
please don't do it.

693
01:22:24,277 --> 01:22:28,615
- Annie, for God's...
- Shh, darling.
Trust me.

694
01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:29,866
God's sake!

695
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:32,494
- It's for the best.
- Annie, please!

696
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:34,788
Agh!

697
01:22:35,705 --> 01:22:38,625
Almost done.
Just one more.

698
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,713
Agh!

699
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:50,261
God, I love you.

700
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:17,414
(tyres screech)

701
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:19,416
(horn)

702
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,377
You cockadoodie!

703
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:38,184
- (man) Turn on this!
- (Annie) You poop!

704
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:58,079
- Just leave it, all right?
- Oh, I like that tone!

705
01:23:58,204 --> 01:24:03,001
How many times must I tell you?
I have a system here!
Where the hell is that thing?

706
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:05,837
- What thing?
- The thing!

707
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:10,342
- Here it is, where it's supposed to be.
- What is it?

708
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:13,345
I'm not sure.
Maybe nothing.

709
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:17,891
- Well, I'm glad you found it.
- There's that spice again.

710
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:35,760
(Annie)
Come on, Misie.
Come on.

711
01:25:37,053 --> 01:25:39,431
Hi, punkin.

712
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:45,228
Such a kidder!
Come on, Misery.

713
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:49,941
Come on, Misie.

714
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:58,366
- Hey, Pete.
- Buster.

715
01:25:58,491 --> 01:26:02,203
- Answer me a couple of things.
- If I can.

716
01:26:02,328 --> 01:26:04,664
Do you have any new
Paul Sheldon books?

717
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:08,418
Well, we had a batch.
Sold 'em all out in three days.

718
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:12,672
You wouldn't happen to know
if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

719
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:16,509
Are you kidding?
Every time that fella writes a new book,...

720
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:19,262
..she has me set aside the first copy.

721
01:26:20,555 --> 01:26:23,475
Has she been buying anything odd lately?

722
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,062
Miz Wilkes?
Same old stuff.

723
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:30,982
Lest you call paper odd.

724
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:35,278
- Newspaper?
- No. The typing kind.

725
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:38,406
Oh, that kind.
Nothing odd about that.

726
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,410
- Miz Wilkes done something?
- Not a thing.

727
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:57,759
(car approaches)

728
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,738
(footsteps)

729
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,536
Agh!

730
01:27:43,096 --> 01:27:45,724
I don't think I'll ever understand you.
I cook your meals,...

731
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,810
...I tend to you
practically 24 hours a day,...

732
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:53,648
..and you continue to fight me.
When are we going to develop a sense of trust?

733
01:28:22,802 --> 01:28:24,304
Oh, my!

734
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:28,516
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you,
but you didn't give me a chance to knock.

735
01:28:28,683 --> 01:28:34,189
I guess you can tell I'm not all
that used to visitors.
What can I do for you?

736
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:38,318
Well, I was wondering, do you happen
to know anything about Paul Sheldon?

737
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,237
What do you want to know?

738
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,865
Well, anything you could
tell me might help.

739
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:47,911
Well, he was born in Worcester,
Massachusetts, 45 years ago,...

740
01:28:48,078 --> 01:28:51,456
..the only child of Franklin and
Helene Sheldon, mediocre student...

741
01:28:51,581 --> 01:28:54,542
That isn't exactly the kinda
information I'm after.

742
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:57,337
See, he's been missing
for some time now, and...

743
01:28:57,462 --> 01:29:00,423
I know.
It's so upsetting.
I'm his number one fan.

744
01:29:00,548 --> 01:29:03,051
I've got all his books.
Every sentence he ever put down.

745
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:06,221
I'm so proud
of my Paul Sheldon collection.

746
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:12,227
Well, here I am prattling on
and my manners have just flown away.

747
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:14,521
I haven't invited you in.
Please.

748
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:16,690
Thank you.

749
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:20,068
Of course, you must know
about that horrible accident.

750
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:23,863
- Mind if I take a look around?
- Of course not.

751
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:29,285
That accident almost killed me, too.
I prayed when I heard the news.

752
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,872
I got down on my knees
and I begged for it not to be true.

753
01:29:32,997 --> 01:29:37,836
You're gonna laugh at what I'm about
to say, but go ahead, I don't care.

754
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:42,090
When I was praying,
God told me to get ready.

755
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:45,635
- Get ready for what?
- To be his replacement.

756
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,388
He gave so much pleasure
to so many people...

757
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:51,474
..and there's a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days,...

758
01:29:51,599 --> 01:29:53,643
..in case you hadn't noticed.

759
01:29:53,768 --> 01:29:56,438
God told me,
since I was his number one fan,...

760
01:29:56,563 --> 01:30:00,066
..that I should make up new stories
as if I was Paul Sheldon.

761
01:30:00,191 --> 01:30:04,320
So I went to town, and I bought
a typewriter, and paper to type on,...

762
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:06,906
..the same kind Paul Sheldon used.

763
01:30:07,032 --> 01:30:11,411
And I turned the guest bedroom into
a writing studio.
Would you like to see it?

764
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:14,164
- Sure.
- It's right this way.

765
01:30:23,798 --> 01:30:29,137
I know how he wrote.
The kinds of words he used,
the wonderful stories he told...

766
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:32,682
I've spent the last four weeks
trying to write like Paul Sheldon,...

767
01:30:32,807 --> 01:30:34,601
..but I can't do it right.

768
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:39,647
I try and I try, and I know all the words,
but it's just not the same.

769
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:43,443
Well, maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

770
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:47,447
I could give you a coupla hundred pages
and you could tell me what you think.

771
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:49,449
I'm not much of a critic.

772
01:30:49,616 --> 01:30:51,618
Well, I just thought...

773
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:56,581
Oh, you'd think I'd never had a guest before!
Would you like a cup of cocoa?

774
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:59,084
- No, really, I don't...
- It's no trouble.

775
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,628
There's some already made.

776
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:11,596
Must get lonely,
living out here all by yourself.

777
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:15,934
Well, if you can't enjoy
your own company,...

778
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:18,186
..you're not fit company for anyone else.

779
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:20,647
Well, you've got a point there.

780
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:28,071
(both chuckle)

781
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:28,673
Here you are.

782
01:32:28,798 --> 01:32:33,720
Well, thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't
wanna take up any more of your time.

783
01:32:34,846 --> 01:32:36,723
I best be going.

784
01:32:36,848 --> 01:32:39,976
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

785
01:32:40,101 --> 01:32:44,356
I'm sure it's wonderful,
but I really should be getting back.

786
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:53,198
If you wouldn't mind, perhaps I could
pay you another visit sometime.

787
01:32:53,323 --> 01:32:56,493
I'd be delighted.
Now that you know the way.

788
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:08,338
(clanking)

789
01:33:14,678 --> 01:33:16,721
Miz Wilkes?

790
01:33:17,514 --> 01:33:19,974
Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

791
01:33:20,725 --> 01:33:22,519
(Paul)
Here!

792
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:24,437
Here!
I'm down here!

793
01:33:25,438 --> 01:33:27,440
I'm down here!

794
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,695
Mr Sheldon?

795
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:44,416
Don't feel bad, Paul.

796
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:49,963
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.
It's a sign.

797
01:33:51,881 --> 01:33:56,720
You see, I've known for some time
why I was chosen to save you.

798
01:33:56,845 --> 01:33:59,931
You and I were meant
to be together for ever.

799
01:34:00,056 --> 01:34:02,600
But now our time in this world must end.

800
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:08,106
But don't worry, Paul.
I've prepared for what must be done.

801
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:14,446
I put two bullets in my gun,
one for you and one for me.

802
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:18,533
Oh, darling, it'll be so beautiful.

803
01:34:31,796 --> 01:34:34,299
(footsteps)

804
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:40,263
Now don't be afraid.

805
01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:43,516
I love you.

806
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:48,188
I love you, too.

807
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:55,487
And you're right.
We are meant to be together.

808
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:58,656
And I know we must die.

809
01:35:00,116 --> 01:35:04,287
But it must be...
so that Misery can live.

810
01:35:06,456 --> 01:35:11,086
We have the power
to give Misery eternal life.

811
01:35:12,754 --> 01:35:15,131
We must finish the book.

812
01:35:18,301 --> 01:35:21,971
But the time is now.
Soon others will come.

813
01:35:23,807 --> 01:35:26,101
It's almost finished.

814
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:29,979
By dawn...

815
01:35:30,105 --> 01:35:34,901
..we'll be able to give Misery...
back to the world.

816
01:35:57,632 --> 01:36:00,051
I'll fix you something to eat.

817
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:21,531
Oh, Paul, I'm dying!
Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne?

818
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:25,994
You'll know very soon.
I've just started the last chapter.

819
01:36:26,745 --> 01:36:32,292
You know... when I finish...
I'd like everything to be perfect.

820
01:36:33,376 --> 01:36:35,295
I'll need three things.

821
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:37,505
What things?

822
01:36:38,173 --> 01:36:40,383
You mean you don't know?

823
01:36:41,593 --> 01:36:43,887
I was fooling, silly.

824
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:47,140
You need a cigarette, because
you used to smoke but quit,...

825
01:36:47,265 --> 01:36:50,602
..except when you finish a book,
and you have just one.

826
01:36:50,769 --> 01:36:57,734
And the match is to light it, and you need
one glass of champagne, Dom Perig-non.

827
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:00,862
Dom Perig-non it is.

828
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:22,258
Annie?

829
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:24,219
Annie!

830
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:26,638
Yes, Paul?

831
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:30,725
I'm almost done.

832
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:33,478
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic!

833
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:36,898
Ian and Windthorne duelling
for the right to Misery's hand.

834
01:37:37,023 --> 01:37:41,403
Does Ian win?
Oh, don't tell me...
It's Windthorne, right?

835
01:37:41,528 --> 01:37:45,949
You'll know everything in a minute.
Get the champagne.

836
01:37:47,242 --> 01:37:49,536
Oh...
Oh...

837
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:24,946
Did I do good?

838
01:38:25,822 --> 01:38:28,116
You did perfect.

839
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:32,078
Except for one thing.

840
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:35,749
This time we'll need... two glasses.

841
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:39,210
Oh, Paul!

842
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:18,208
Remember how, all those years, nobody
knew who Misery's real father was?

843
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:22,253
Or if they'd ever be reunited?
It's all right here.

844
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:26,174
Does she finally marry Ian,
or will it be Windthorne?

845
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:28,885
It's all right here.

846
01:39:30,762 --> 01:39:32,806
Paul, you can't!

847
01:39:32,972 --> 01:39:35,392
Why not?
I learned it from you.

848
01:39:37,519 --> 01:39:41,606
No, no, no!
Not Misery!
Not my Misery!

849
01:39:41,981 --> 01:39:44,567
No!
Not my Misery!

850
01:39:56,663 --> 01:39:59,541
I'm gonna kill you, you lying cocksucker!

851
01:40:03,586 --> 01:40:05,255
Agh!

852
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:14,389
Agh!

853
01:40:38,663 --> 01:40:41,708
Here, you want it?
You want it?!
Eat it!

854
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:46,463
Eat it till you choke,
you sick, twisted fuck!

855
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:37,263
(Annie screams)

856
01:42:39,576 --> 01:42:42,787
This is it.
The very first copy.

857
01:42:42,912 --> 01:42:46,166
The word I'm getting
is the Times review will be a love letter.

858
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:47,667
That'll be a first.

859
01:42:47,792 --> 01:42:50,837
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek
say they're both raves.

860
01:42:50,962 --> 01:42:54,674
And don't laugh, but I think
you've got a shot at some prizes.

861
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:56,676
Great.

862
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,638
I thought you'd be thrilled.
You're being taken seriously.

863
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:05,310
I'm delighted the critics are liking it
and I hope the people like it, too.

864
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:07,896
But...
I wrote it for me.

865
01:43:08,772 --> 01:43:12,817
Now, don't think
I'm completely nuts, but...

866
01:43:12,984 --> 01:43:16,529
..in some way...
Annie Wilkes...

867
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:20,116
..that whole experience, uh...

868
01:43:21,117 --> 01:43:23,203
..helped me.

869
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:25,413
Paul, since you brought her up,...

870
01:43:25,538 --> 01:43:29,000
..I have to ask this or l'll be
drummed out of the agents' union.

871
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:32,754
How would you feel about
a non-fiction book about what went on?

872
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:35,548
Gee, if I didn't know better
I'd think you were suggesting...

873
01:43:35,674 --> 01:43:39,302
..I dredge up the worst horror
of my life just to make a few bucks.

874
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,555
I thought you were over it.

875
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:45,975
I don't know if anyone could totally
get over something like that.

876
01:43:46,142 --> 01:43:48,186
It's weird.

877
01:43:49,562 --> 01:43:52,273
Even though I know she's dead,...

878
01:43:52,982 --> 01:43:55,902
..I still think about her once in a while.

879
01:43:56,027 --> 01:43:59,781
Excuse me.
I don't mean to bother you,
but are you Paul Sheldon?

880
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,574
Yes.

881
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,536
I just wanna tell you
I'm your number one fan.

882
01:44:05,495 --> 01:44:07,956
That's very sweet of you.

883
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:13,962
(Liberace)
* I'll be seeing you

884
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:20,010
* In all the old familiar places

885
01:44:21,469 --> 01:44:27,475
* That this heart of mine embraces

886
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:32,564
* All day through

887
01:44:34,899 --> 01:44:40,530
* In that small café

888
01:44:41,489 --> 01:44:46,995
* The park across the way

889
01:44:48,747 --> 01:44:53,668
* The children's carousel

890
01:44:54,753 --> 01:44:57,339
* The chestnut trees

891
01:44:57,922 --> 01:45:01,134
* The wishing well

892
01:45:02,177 --> 01:45:07,223
* I'll be seeing you

893
01:45:08,641 --> 01:45:14,022
* In every lovely summer's day

894
01:45:15,357 --> 01:45:20,945
* In everything that's light and gay

895
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:27,577
* I'll always think of you that way

896
01:45:28,661 --> 01:45:34,459
* I'll find you in the morning sun

897
01:45:35,251 --> 01:45:39,964
* And when the night is new

898
01:45:40,632 --> 01:45:45,345
* I'll be looking at the moon

899
01:45:45,762 --> 01:45:51,643
* But I'll be seeing you

900
01:45:57,232 --> 01:46:02,362
* I'll be seeing you
in every lovely summer's day

901
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:09,285
* I'll be seeing you
in everything that's light and gay

902
01:46:11,037 --> 01:46:14,791
* I'll always think of you that way

903
01:46:16,334 --> 01:46:22,215
* I'll find you in the morning sun

904
01:46:23,174 --> 01:46:29,806
* And when the night is new

905
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:35,729
* I'll be looking at the moon

906
01:46:36,646 --> 01:46:48,992
* But I'll be seeing you
