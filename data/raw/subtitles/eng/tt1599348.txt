1
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,135
<i>I'm going to talk to
Parker about my promotion today.</i>

2
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:37,015
In the worst-case scenario
you're two weeks ahead of me,

3
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,184
you get a gorgeous little
apartment in the Marais.

4
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,687
What if I don't want
to live in the Marais?

5
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,317
<i>We could live
somewhere else, then.</i>

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,777
Yeah?
Yeah.

7
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,404
We could go to Detroit.

8
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:52,488
Detroit?

9
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,699
Yeah, you could
meet my mom and dad.

10
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:59,037
<i>You can meet my sister.
She owns a bakery,</i>

11
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,080
and she will make you fat.

12
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,220
I have six hours before I have
to go back to the hospital.

13
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,767
You want to go
back into bed with me?

14
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:23,645
<i>I do.</i>

15
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,774
But I got back-to-back
meetings all morning.

16
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,360
Too bad for you.

17
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:31,861
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

18
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,529
<i>But I got to get in.</i>

19
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:34,656
<i>There's probably
already 25 people</i>

20
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,407
<i>lined up outside
the door, waiting.</i>

21
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,376
I love when you speak French.

22
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,518
<i>Satcom check.</i>

23
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,604
Echo Nine Three
Victor Echo Two.

24
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,564
<i>Ops Center.</i>

25
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,817
<i>This is safe house 7-R.
We're open for business.</i>

26
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,901
<i>Confirmed.</i>

27
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,653
<i>Any reservations?</i>

28
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:14,904
<i>Nothing in the registry.</i>

29
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,155
<i>Walk-ins?</i>

30
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,158
<i>Not expected.
Reconfirm in three hours.</i>

31
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,785
Understood.

32
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,678
<i>Matt?
Your cell, really?</i>

33
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,806
Relax, I've got
an encryption packet.

34
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,891
<i>You know me, I never relax.</i>

35
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,060
Watch the cholesterol, old man.

36
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,478
<i>You sound like Miriam.</i>

37
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,230
So, what's new in Cape Town?

38
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,398
<i>Nothing, nothing.</i>

39
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,109
<i>I updated my Surveillance Target Analysis.
It's complete now.</i>

40
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,486
Yeah, that's an exit report.
It's not due until you leave.

41
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,531
Exactly. Exactly.
And when is that?

42
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,657
<i>How long has it been?</i>

43
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,325
Twelve months.

44
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,202
<i>Well, talk to me
in another four.</i>

45
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,705
David, I'm dying here.

46
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,749
What's happening
with the post in Paris?

47
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,001
One slot, 37 applicants.

48
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,420
Every one of them with more
field experience than you.

49
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,380
How am I supposed to
get more experience?

50
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,549
I'm staring at
four walls all day.

51
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,260
I got passed up on Rome,
then Berlin.

52
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,887
<i>You said yourself, my
evaluation was excellent.</i>

53
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,764
<i>Just put it in
front of Whitford.</i>

54
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,349
I know he'll see that I'm
ready to go, I'm all in.

55
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,144
Matt, I know
this has been hard,

56
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,229
<i>but it's the way
the system works.</i>

57
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,775
<i>Look, I'll talk to Whitford about
Paris, but I can't promise anything.</i>

58
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:35,985
<i>Look, I've got to go.</i>

59
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,739
Don't worry,
I'm looking after you, okay?

60
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,533
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

61
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,986
<i>This is not a negotiation.</i>

62
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,408
<i>It's 10 million.</i>

63
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,202
You'll get the file,
and if the money

64
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,037
is not in the account
by 3:00 p.m.,

65
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,957
<i>I'll take it to another buyer.</i>

66
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,252
<i>How do we know
that you won't do that anyway?</i>

67
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,463
You don't.

68
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,481
Here you are, sir.

69
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,403
Alec, how are you?

70
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,995
Petrus, 1972.

71
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:10,830
You look good.

72
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,124
I do, don't I?

73
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,879
So, how are things at MI6?

74
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:22,049
The usual. Same bureaucratic
bullshit and appalling remuneration.

75
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,217
Life of a government man.

76
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,343
Mmm-hmm.

77
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,557
So...

78
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,312
The original file.

79
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,189
Dates, transactions, names.

80
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,941
A bargain at triple the price.

81
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,402
Take a look.

82
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,945
Hmm.

83
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,410
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

84
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,498
Tobin...

85
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,792
What's in that box
is going to make

86
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,210
the world
a smaller place for you,

87
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,462
for both of us.

88
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,466
I got your account.

89
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,093
You get your cut
24 hours after transaction.

90
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,720
Some of our old bosses
aren't going to be happy

91
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,639
these files are out
in the open.

92
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,350
Do I make you nervous?

93
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,686
Always.
Good.

94
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,025
You want her?

95
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,873
Please, listen to me.

96
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,167
I had nothing to do with this.

97
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,502
Stop.

98
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:52,927
Let's go.

99
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,270
Tobin, you have to believe me.

100
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,898
I knew nothing
about any of that.

101
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,566
Did you know if
anybody was following you?

102
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,778
No, I don't think
anybody was following me.

103
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,488
I swear on my life,
Tobin, I had absolutely...

104
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,741
Slow down.

105
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,555
We're going by foot.

106
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,599
<i>Head towards the square.</i>

107
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,001
Move! Move! Move!

108
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,136
We're heading west.

109
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,597
<i>Holland Street.
Move, move.</i>

110
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,550
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.

111
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,866
My name is Tobin Frost.

112
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,206
Linklater.

113
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,961
When?

114
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,505
Lock down the consulate.

115
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,133
Get me a team in the Situation
Room in five minutes.

116
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,634
I want everything we got
on Tobin Frost.

117
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,719
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,141
Is it him?
Yep.

119
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,225
Whitford know?

120
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,643
I'm on my way there now.

121
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,780
Sir, place your finger in
there until I tell you to stop.

122
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank you.

123
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,953
So how long has he been
playing in your backyard?

124
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,872
We're working to get you
that answer right now.

125
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,956
Meaning you don't know.

126
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,458
No, meaning,
we're looking into it.

127
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,252
The guy goes rogue,
he spends nine years

128
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,046
selling out the Agency
to all takers.

129
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,173
To Russia, China, Iran,
you name it.

130
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,008
The guy is just not
going to prance

131
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,177
into an American consulate
without good reason.

132
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,973
All right, listen up.

133
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,308
Everybody off the phone.

134
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,105
Tobin Frost has
just waltzed his way

135
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,649
into a U.S. Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.

136
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,776
Now this man, without question,

137
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,986
is one of the most notorious
traders that we've got.

138
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,988
Errington, call up
his background profile.

139
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,744
Tobin Frost was
recruited into the Agency in 1984.

140
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,872
He tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.

141
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,668
His first assignment was in
Lebanon, in January, 1985.

142
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,129
Three months later,
he captured and flipped

143
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,505
a high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.

144
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,715
<i>Over the next several years,</i>

145
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,511
<i>Frost successfully questioned and
recruited many high-value individuals.</i>

146
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,514
He became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets,

147
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,434
and he literally rewrote Agency
interrogation protocols.

148
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,018
Frost served
in many active theaters,

149
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,938
including Libya
from 1995 to 1998,

150
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,690
Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

151
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,358
During his tenure in Jordan,

152
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,318
Frost was suspected of leaking
information to Mossad,

153
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,529
but nothing was confirmed.

154
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,948
Ten years ago, Frost went off
the reservation completely.

155
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,992
<i>He currently has no allegiances</i>

156
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,703
<i>and is wanted for espionage
on four continents.</i>

157
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,582
His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011.

158
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,918
You know, Harlan, we should
interrogate Frost now.

159
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,420
Sweat him for
everything he's got.

160
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,505
Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.

161
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,632
I have an interrogator in Yemen,
can be there in eight hours.

162
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,926
I already have a team in Jo'burg
that can be there in two.

163
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,845
We'll take Frost to the safe
house, interrogate him there.

164
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,805
My people are fully
capable of handling this.

165
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,682
This is Tobin Frost.

166
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,395
We'll go with Jo'burg.

167
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,357
Okay.

168
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,906
You must turn around.

169
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,745
Help. Help.

170
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,083
Accident.

171
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,221
Housekeeping.

172
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,723
<i>We have
a last-minute reservation.</i>

173
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,099
ETA for check-in?

174
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,727
<i>Sometime tonight.
Freeark Insurance.</i>

175
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,103
Got it.

176
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,528
<i>Hello.</i>
Hey.

177
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,612
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

178
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,156
<i>Parker just handed me
his oversight papers to finish</i>

179
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,825
and his daughter Chloe's got the
measles, can you believe that?

180
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,619
How long are you
going to be out for?

181
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,038
<i>I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

182
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,748
Okay. Well, look,
I'm gonna dive into this,

183
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,459
and then hopefully I can meet
up with you later, okay?

184
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,794
<i>Yeah, that sounds good.</i>

185
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,003
Hey, hey...

186
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,215
<i>I love you.</i>

187
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,883
I love you, too.

188
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,302
Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

189
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,528
Extraction team
is in the air, sir.

190
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,071
They should be on the
ground within the hour.

191
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,574
I want that team in and out of
the city in less than 12 hours.

192
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:54,992
We're not even supposed to have

193
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,660
- a presence in Cape Town.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,832
<i>Any communications about Frost's
whereabouts are strictly need-to-know.</i>

195
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,676
Sir, the extraction team is en
route to the consulate now.

196
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,183
Who's reaching out
to 7-R?

197
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,435
Richards, ma'am.

198
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,936
I want the housekeeper briefed.

199
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,022
High-priority target is coming in.
I want the house quiet.

200
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,356
Under no circumstances
should there be

201
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,025
any communication
until the team has left.

202
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,401
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,141
Yeah?

204
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,309
<i>Do you have a room?</i>

205
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,644
Account?
<i>Daniel Kiefer.</i>

206
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,563

207
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,942
Kiefer. Freeark Insurance.
K-I-E-F-E-R.

208
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,027
<i>You are a go.</i>

209
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,071
You're good to go.

210
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,089
Hi, I'm Weston.
Guest room?

211
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,883
It's right around the corner.
Two rights and a left.

212
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,468
All the way back.

213
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,992
That's Tobin Frost.

214
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,370
Stay with him. Let's
go download our gear.

215
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,454
Yes, sir.

216
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,269
Linen closet?

217
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,146
Down the hall. Just right
at the end, there.

218
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,192
Kill all the surveillance
cameras in this room.

219
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,086
<i>My name is Daniel Kiefer.</i>

220
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,007
<i>We were at The Farm together.</i>

221
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,011
<i>Technically,
you were a year ahead.</i>

222
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,434
I'm here to make you
aware of your rights.

223
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,812
You're being held under
a National Security Directive,

224
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,606
which means you have none,
but you know that.

225
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,690
Six-hundreds.

226
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,611
The towels,
you need six-hundreds.

227
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,198
Those are 350,
375-gram weight.

228
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,868
You're gonna
need six-hundreds.

229
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,376
<i>I want to know the reasons
for you being in Cape Town.</i>

230
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,298
I want you to name your
resources, contacts, assets,

231
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,800
everybody you've
done business with,

232
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,468
traded intel with,
sold secrets to,

233
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,262
in the nine years since you
betrayed your country.

234
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,308
Absolutely.
Anything you want, Daniel.

235
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,651
<i>Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed lasted 20 seconds.</i>

236
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,945
They had six-hundreds.

237
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,590
Is this legal?

238
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,100
Bring him down.

239
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,626
Bring him up.

240
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,809
How long was that?

241
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,235
All right, take him down.

242
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,171
Bring him up!

243
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,063
Get me a knife.

244
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:05,904
Miller?

245
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,164
Get in there with Frost.

246
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,666
Sir, all the security cameras
are down.

247
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,709
- Reboot. I want to see what's out there.
- Copy that.

248
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,003
Let's go, boys!

249
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,214
Go! Go! Go!

250
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,050
Let's go, move!

251
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,766
Velez, take this corner.

252
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,394
Ericksson,
get the back elevator.

253
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,776
Pope, what do you got?

254
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,155
Sir, I see approximately 12
heavily armed men in perimeter two.

255
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,825
Okay, gents!
Work fore to aft.

256
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,868
Two-by-twos.
Perimeter two.

257
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,293
- Greer?
- Sir!

258
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,879
- Ericksson?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,506
Velez?

260
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,509
Velez?

261
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,885
I'm good!

262
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,680
Let's go, fellas.

263
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,033
- Incoming!
- Grenade!

264
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,593
Greer!

265
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,013
Step-slide!
Start walking back!

266
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,602
Velez!
Three-round bursts!

267
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,574
Velez, where's Greer?

268
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,909
He's over there, sir.

269
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,619
Go, son.

270
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,422
This ain't a test.
This is the real thing.

271
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,677
What are you gonna do?

272
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,346
You don't want to try me.

273
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,022
- Magazine!
- Let's go.

274
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,947
Velez, stay there!

275
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,949
Listen to me, stay there!

276
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,580
Son of a bitch!

277
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,006
Miller!

278
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,010
Miller!

279
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,888
Hey! Get in here!

280
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,685
Hey, hey. Take these.

281
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,186
Go watch him.

282
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,830
Hey, they're here for me,
but they want me alive.

283
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:44,998
You, they'll kill.

284
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:50,920
You got one in the chamber?

285
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,176
It's okay.

286
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,096
I remember my first posting.
Rio de Janeiro.

287
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,849
A house like this.
Beautiful women.

288
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,351
Not one single visitor, but
I remember rule number one.

289
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,437
You are responsible
for your houseguest.

290
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,521
I'm your houseguest.

291
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,363
The clock is ticking.
They gave you the keys.

292
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,489
Do your duty, son.

293
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,201
Shut up. Let me think.

294
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,290
You want to be the guy
that lost Tobin Frost?

295
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,423
Tick-took,
tick-took, tick-took.

296
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,823
Where's Frost?

297
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,057
We're leaving.

298
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,993
Where is he?

299
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,638
Stay here, stay here!
Wait! Don't move!

300
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,310
Hey, hey, hey!

301
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:17,900
Go!

302
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,447
Get in the trunk.

303
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,532
Are you serious?
Yeah, get in.

304
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,534
The trunk?
Get in the trunk now!

305
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,724
No!

306
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:09,702
<i>Ops Center.</i>

307
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,996
Echo Three Victor Echo Nine.

308
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,039
<i>Go ahead.</i>

309
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,500
This is Weston. 7-R's been hit.
Everyone's dead.

310
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,835
<i>I need you to repeat that, please.
Say again.</i>

311
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,047
Kiefer, his team, everyone,
they're all dead.

312
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,382
<i>Stand by.</i>

313
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,510
<i>Transferring.</i>

314
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,638
It's the house.

315
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,766
Linklater.
<i>This is Weston.</i>

316
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,309
The safe house
has been breached.

317
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,145
What's your location?

318
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,231
<i>I'm eastbound on Albert Road.</i>

319
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,817
<i>I'm just passing Woodstock.</i>

320
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,654
I want eyes on this.
Real-time sat feed.

321
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,615
<i>And what's
the location of the guest?</i>

322
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,200
<i>We escaped.</i>

323
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,952
<i>Clarify.
Do you have the guest?</i>

324
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,328
Yes, we escaped!

325
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,747
Look, I can make it
to the consulate.

326
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,082
<i>There's no chance for SDR,</i>

327
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,375
<i>I think I might have
picked up a tail.</i>

328
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,669
We can't have a gun battle
in front of the consulate.

329
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,213
Diplomatic catastrophe.

330
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,006
Where's that satellite feed?

331
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,217
Denied by National Recon.
War theater use only.

332
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,886
Buy us some time.

333
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,015
Do not go to the consulate.

334
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,601
<i>Follow protocol Alpha Zero.</i>

335
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,312
<i>Secure the guest
and stay off the grid.</i>

336
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:22,525
Reconnect at 1800 hours.
I repeat, stay off the grid.

337
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,777
Copy, copy, copy.

338
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,763
All right, Cape Town police
have responded to the house.

339
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,139
Confirmed. LINKLATER: I
want the site secured.

340
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,223
I'm hearing nine dead.

341
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:42,892
Initiating damage control.

342
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,727
I'm on it.
Reaching out to NIA now.

343
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,772
The locals are going to
have that house locked off.

344
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:51,817
<i>Check all the traffic
cameras, police reports...</i>

345
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,529
<i>Find out why Frost wanted to go
in that consulate to begin with</i>

346
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,198
and who in the hell else
might be after him.

347
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,119
We need to get Weston and
Frost out of South Africa.

348
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,955
Now, do we have any tactical teams?
Anything in play?

349
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,416
Yeah, I have assets in
Egypt, but they're in deep.

350
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,835
If I pull them out, that would
compromise two years' worth of work.

351
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,462
I can scramble a team
from Europe or Asia,

352
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,756
but it's going to
take at least 18 hours.

353
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,968
At this point,
Weston is all we got.

354
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,934
I need to find out who this
Matt Weston is, right now.

355
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,104
<i>Matthew James Weston.</i>

356
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:32,066
<i>Born 02-24-82 to
Terry and Madeline Weston</i>

357
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,943
<i>in Port Washington, New York.</i>

358
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,361
<i>An assault arrest,
one month after</i>

359
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,487
<i>both parents and
a younger sister</i>

360
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,197
<i>were killed in
a traffic accident</i>

361
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,865
<i>in which his
father's blood-alcohol</i>

362
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,659
<i>was twice the legal limit.</i>

363
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,329
Yale, degree in Economics,
recruited out of Yale law.

364
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:48,624
<i>High marks in analytics
and linguistics at The Farm.</i>

365
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,210
<i>Excellent in tradecraft skills.</i>

366
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,338
His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,
is a French national.

367
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:58,551
<i>He reported them as having
"close and continuing contact."</i>

368
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,512
<i>She's a second year resident in the
oncology department at Groote Schuur.</i>

369
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,555
Get in that car.

370
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,765
She accepted a
position with Hotel-Dieu Hospital

371
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,517
in Paris, starts in two weeks.

372
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,311
No known political
affiliations. She's clean.

373
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,939
I want you to post a car
outside their apartment.

374
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,524
Use back channels.

375
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,403
And get NSA to cross-check their telephone
records and their e-mails, please.

376
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,487
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,753
You know, it would be easier
if I knew where we were going.

378
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:37,006
You just drive, all right?
Just drive, middle lane.

379
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,257
All right.

380
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,428
Hey, what are you doing?
Middle lane.

381
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,556
Just drive around.

382
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,767
All right.
I'm driving.

383
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,356
Nice to know who you're talking to.
What's your name?

384
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,609
You crushed my windpipe.

385
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,694
Well, you locked me
in the trunk.

386
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,241
Come on, you're not NOC. You're
here under your real name.

387
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,284
What is it?

388
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,494
Weston, Matt.

389
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:08,204
All right.

390
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,080
How long you been
a safe house keeper?

391
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,123
Twelve months.

392
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,374
Happy birthday.

393
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,004
Cape Town,
that's low-level detail.

394
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,757
You should have been
out of here by now.

395
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,926
Maybe I requested
the assignment.

396
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:26,597
Or maybe Langley doesn't trust
you with anything else.

397
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:31,143
So, what's your plan?

398
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,230
Oh, let me guess.
Follow protocol.

399
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,482
Protocol states that
if your house is crashed,

400
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,360
you do an SDR to make sure
no one's following you.

401
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:43,656
Activate your GPS in your Go-Bag,
select another safe house.

402
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,743
You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?

403
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,328
I think you need to shut up.

404
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:53,207
I think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place.

405
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,292
Have you done that, Matt?

406
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,840
They followed Kiefer. They
followed him from the consulate,

407
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,007
and that's how they
found the safe house.

408
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,717
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

409
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:07,304
How did they know I was near the
consulate in the first place?

410
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:10,641
Hmm.

411
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,061
But I like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.

412
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,064
Like the Hardy Boys.

413
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,193
That house was
a secure location.

414
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,611
Whoever crashed it

415
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:26,866
didn't stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house.

416
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,243
They were invited. Someone
told them, Matthew.

417
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,579
Think about it.
Someone you know.

418
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:34,415
So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?

419
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,292
Go ahead, you're not
going to get in my head.

420
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,836
I already am in your head.

421
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,546
They're going to
isolate you, Matt.

422
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:41,922
They're going to be real
nice to you at first.

423
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,717
They're going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like,

424
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,803
"You did a decent job, son
We'll take it from here."

425
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,305
That's when you know
you're screwed.

426
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,391
Forget about me. They're
going to focus on you.

427
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,685
They're going to try and make a
connection between you and I.

428
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,729
So that if this all goes wrong,

429
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,397
they'll have something
to fall back on

430
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,858
in their little
Senate hearings.

431
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,697
I'm not your
only enemy tonight.

432
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,743
<i>So, it's someone in-house.</i>

433
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,995
It's the only way this
thing could've happened.

434
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,705
We were completely buttoned up.

435
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,918
I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.

436
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,502
Backgrounds, affiliations,

437
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,213
particularly any
connections with Frost.

438
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,841
Every movement right
up until this operation.

439
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,552
Your extraction team, how
long had they been together?

440
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,473
My team had been together
six months. Why?

441
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,434
Well, I'm just trying to
get my head around this.

442
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:37,978
That will do, thank you.

443
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,713
<i>Hello.</i>
Hey.

444
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:29,840
<i>Baby, where are you?</i>

445
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm all right.
I'm okay.

446
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:33,927
I'm okay.

447
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,432
<i>I'm sorry I didn't call you
back, I saw your missed calls.</i>

448
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,184
<i>You must be worried sick.</i>

449
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,518
Is everything okay?

450
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,314
<i>I'm good.
I'm good. Listen.</i>

451
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,024
<i>This sounds so crazy.</i>

452
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,526
We had some threats against
the clinic last night,

453
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,778
so Parker and I,
we stayed all night

454
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,072
trying to get to
the bottom of it.

455
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:57,034
<i>And I'm sorry that I didn't call you back.
I should have, right away.</i>

456
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,660
I was so worried.

457
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:00,245
<i>I know.</i>

458
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:06,126
Can you do me a favor? Can you go
over to the window for a second?

459
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,336
<i>Why?</i>

460
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,838
<i>Can you just take a quick
look out the window?</i>

461
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,965
<i>I want you to see if
there's anyone out there.</i>

462
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,134
<i>Are there any cars
that don't belong?</i>

463
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,011
<i>Anyone hanging
around out front?</i>

464
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,389
There's a police car.

465
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,601
<i>What's going on?</i>

466
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,685
<i>I'm sorry about this.</i>

467
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:24,978
<i>I know this is a lot,</i>

468
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:26,647
but we felt like
it would be best

469
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,273
if we didn't go home
as a precaution,

470
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:29,316
and I agree with him.

471
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,110
I know there's nothing to worry
about, but I agree with him.

472
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,487
<i>I think you should just go to
Dena's for a little while,</i>

473
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,406
<i>just for a few hours, and I'll
call you in a little bit.</i>

474
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,868
<i>And we'll get together, okay?</i>

475
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:48,961
Okay, I'll go.

476
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:55,634
<i>Okay. I love you. I'll talk
to you soon, all right?</i>

477
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,053
<i>Don't worry. Okay, bye.</i>

478
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,162
She know what you do
for a living?

479
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,671
The girl on the phone.
It was a girl, wasn't it?

480
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,842
Maybe it was a guy,
I don't know.

481
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,135
I don't judge.

482
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:47,186
You can't expect to have a real
relationship in our line of work, Matthew.

483
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,106
Don't worry. She's not
going to leave you.

484
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:55,027
See, what happens is, you try
to protect her with lies,

485
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,695
and then it starts to add up.

486
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:01,033
At the safe house you said that
they'd kill me to get to you.

487
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,576
After a while,
even the truth...

488
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:04,912
Why? ...Starts to
sound like a lie.

489
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,373
You have something. You got something
that they want. What is it?

490
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:09,458
Is she a local?

491
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,542
Don't worry about her.
What is it?

492
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,127
Oh, it is a girl.

493
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:28,560
You'll keep covering your
tracks, she'll keep believing.

494
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,772
Because she wants to,
because she needs to.

495
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,985
That's why we exist, you
and me, that's our job.

496
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,655
To take advantage of that.

497
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,825
People's desire to believe.

498
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:45,744
To trust.

499
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:57,756
She's not going to
leave you, Matthew.

500
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,469
You're going to leave her.

501
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,602
I'm not you.

502
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,370
Correct, sir.
We verified it.

503
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:52,853
That is your boy.
You take it.

504
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,107
Everybody, stand by.

505
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,776
Matty, it's me.

506
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,154
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

507
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,573
I'm all right.

508
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:12,873
Matt, we can't get another
team in for at least 12 hours.

509
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,375
<i>Sorry.</i>

510
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,338
We've cleared a new safe house
for you outside the city.

511
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,131
There's a Go-Bag located

512
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,927
at locker number 256, Green Point
Stadium Metrorail station.

513
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:30,015
<i>The combination
is 2-5-1-22.</i>

514
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,558
2-5-1 -22.

515
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,727
Now, the bag's got a GPS in it.

516
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,270
It'll direct you
to the safe house.

517
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:38,398
<i>But you got to be careful,
it's an active location.</i>

518
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:40,484
<i>So, approach with caution.</i>

519
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,781
Matt?

520
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,994
Do you know how
they found Frost?

521
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,454
Do you know who led them to us?

522
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,792
We're working on that.

523
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,586
We're counting on you, Matt.

524
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,464
Get Frost to that safe house and
you can write your own ticket.

525
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:05,842
I will

526
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,596
<i>I Will.</i>

527
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:20,565
Left at the light.

528
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,984
To the stadium?

529
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,277
Yeah.

530
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:49,761
Hey, scarf.
How much for a scarf?

531
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:52,431
Only fifty rand.

532
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,640
Thanks.

533
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,185
Cuff your hands together.

534
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,353
Together?
Yeah.

535
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,364
Out.

536
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,079
Are you sure you don't
want to just walk away from this?

537
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,122
Can't do that.

538
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,498
Yes, you can.
You should.

539
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,130
Move. Go.
Across the street.

540
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:40,812
Going to the game.
I like games.

541
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,230
Metrorail, straight ahead.

542
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:43,315
Straight ahead.

543
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,409
Right over there.

544
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,680
Let's go.

545
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:41,540
Help! Help! He's
trying to kidnap me!

546
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:42,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

547
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,960
He's trying to
kidnap me! Help!

548
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,211
He's got a gun!

549
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,549
He's got a gun! He's
got a gun right there!

550
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,469
I'm undercover.
I'm undercover!

551
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:56,721
Calm down, sir.
Everybody, calm down!

552
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,567
Get down! Get down!

553
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,028
All right! Okay!

554
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,338
Get him up. Get up.

555
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:31,923
Ow, ow, ow!

556
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:39,848
I'm an American citizen. I don't
know what he wanted from me.

557
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,018
Just calm down.

558
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,587
Hey, hey, hey. I'm a police officer.
I'm from America.

559
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,048
I arrested this man.
His name is Tobin Frost.

560
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,299
Where did you take him?

561
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,217
He's in the infirmary.

562
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,433
There, there!
Is that it?

563
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:27,395
Top left, second screen from the top!
Look, look, the infirmary.

564
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:32,150
Right. Go back.

565
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,204
Third-tier infirmary,
now! Move!

566
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,247
Third-tier infirmary.
Go, now!

567
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,209
Do you see?

568
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,576
Don't move.

569
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,651
Frost!

570
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:42,572
Frost!

571
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:46,409
Frost!

572
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:47,660
Hey!

573
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:50,663
Stop! Stop!

574
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,042
Get out the way!

575
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,376
Stop!

576
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:03,426
No! Stop!

577
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:21,236
Medic!

578
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:48,263
Drop the gun.

579
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:50,181
Drop it.

580
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:52,100
I'm responsible for you.

581
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,105
You're responsible
for yourself.

582
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:02,443
Get on your knees.

583
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:15,832
Are you going to kill me?

584
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,888
I only kill professionals.

585
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,367
<i>Height, approximately six feet.</i>

586
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:54,078
<i>Anglo, wearing
a stadium security jacket.</i>

587
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:57,415
<i>The suspect was last seen entering
Green Point Stadium Metrorail,</i>

588
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,626
<i>stadium concourse.</i>

589
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:12,263
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost
might be doing in Cape Town.

590
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:15,808
Can you bring up...

591
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,771
Alec Wade.
Fifteen-year NOC at MI6.

592
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:23,107
Sabotage, counter-ambush,
counter-IED tactics,

593
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:25,234
until he blew up an op
in Lisbon four years ago

594
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,778
and was put on a desk,
pushing papers.

595
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,113
Cape Town Police found him
shot through the head,

596
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:32,033
high-powered rifle, 14
blocks from the consulate.

597
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,452
Witnesses placed someone
fitting Frost's description

598
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:35,995
in the car at the time
of the shooting.

599
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,456
And we think, what? That
they were working together?

600
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,459
They ran joint operations
in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.

601
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,671
Frost's last sighting
was in Hamburg, 2011.

602
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,131
And what are the Brits
saying about Wade?

603
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,967
Officially,
they're saying nothing.

604
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,093
Unofficially?

605
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:52,428
He's been the subject of a
five-month internal investigation.

606
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,180
They think he's
been trading intel.

607
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,306
Hmm.

608
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,475
So what the hell
did Wade leak to Frost

609
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,728
that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men?

610
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:07,819
I want more details from MI6.
Call in every chit you got.

611
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:08,945
Yes, sir.

612
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,322
David, I want
an internal investigation

613
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:14,117
into Daniel Kiefer
and his team.

614
00:58:58,161 --> 00:59:00,288
I've got Weston calling in
for David Barlow.

615
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:05,585
<i>I lost him.</i>

616
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,045
<i>Frost?</i>

617
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:08,421
<i>Yeah, he's gone.</i>

618
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,965
After I picked up the GPS,
he created a diversion,

619
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:12,717
took out a couple of cops
at the stadium.

620
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,177
Any idea where he's headed?

621
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,636
<i>Not exactly, but I will.</i>

622
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,056
This is Linklater. You
said he took out two cops?

623
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:19,849
Matt, you're on speaker.

624
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,312
Yes, ma'am.
At the Green Point Stadium.

625
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,731
<i>...involvement
in a possible kidnapping.</i>

626
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:29,776
<i>The suspect is being described
as a white male of medium build.</i>

627
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:32,153
Stadium police is
reporting you shot a cop.

628
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,322
<i>I returned fire
in self-defense.</i>

629
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,325
The fact of the matter is,
Frost is on the loose.

630
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,410
<i>I've spent the last
14 hours with him.</i>

631
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:41,829
<i>He might have said or done something
that could lead me to him.</i>

632
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:45,583
You are to stand down,
proceed to the consulate,

633
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,960
and present yourself for exfil and debrief.
Acknowledge.

634
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,463
By the time I'm debriefed,
Frost will be gone.

635
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:52,048
<i>I've spent 12
months researching</i>

636
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,299
<i>every square inch of this town.</i>

637
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,094
<i>I will find Frost
and I'll deliver him.</i>

638
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:58,596
Weston, this is
Harlan Whitford, son.

639
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,186
Now, you've done a fine job,
but we'll take it from here.

640
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,193
Understood.

641
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:34,298
<i>Hello.</i>

642
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:35,800
Sir, I respectfully
request that,

643
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,218
that exchange not
make it onto his files.

644
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:39,762
He's either incompetent or he's
working with somebody else.

645
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,347
Do not make this about Weston.

646
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:42,890
It was your guys
that lost Frost.

647
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,642
It was your team that
folded at the safe house.

648
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,895
I want both of you on an
airplane to Cape Town.

649
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:52,567
Frost is trying to get out of the country.
Go find his ass.

650
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,434
There you go, baby.

651
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,275
One ticket to Jo'burg.

652
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:44,577
Thank you.

653
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:23,324
<i>Police had detained

662
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,081
I lied to you.

About everything.
The NGO, Parker.

664
01:03:19,255 --> 01:03:20,256
My Job.

My family.

666
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,972
So, who do you work for?

667
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,562
The government.

668
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:38,399
CIA.

669
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:40,192
No, I don't...

670
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,194
I don't do anything.

671
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:46,365
I sit around in an apartment all day.
I answer the phone.

672
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,422
I need you to leave.

673
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:05,092
I need you to do that
for me. Okay?

674
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,141
Here.

675
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:15,895
This is a ticket to Jo'burg.

676
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,230
When you get there, you go
straight to the airport.

677
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,940
There's a 6:00 a.m. flight
to Paris.

678
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:21,817
Take this.

679
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,986
You take this.
If anyone stops you...

680
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,906
If anyone stops you...
If anybody stops you...

681
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,532
Who do you think I am?

682
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:29,742

683
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:30,868
Fuck you!

Hey, stop. Stop it.

685

haven't seen me since, okay?

686
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,640
I'm sorry.

687
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:02,316
Just leave. Please?

688
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,446
Do you love me?

689
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,781
Very much.

690
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:11,867
Go. Go.

691
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:19,625

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,903
It's him. What
the hell is he doing?

699
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:30,946
I'm not sure.

700
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,239
I want to see
what he's looking at.

701
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:37,620
<i>He's pulled an old report</i>

702
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:41,040
on surveillance targets living
in the Langa Township area.

703
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,921
<i>It's a profile of Carlos
Villar, a Nicaraguan national.</i>

704
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,215
He's a known document forger.

705
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,175
Get me a copy
of Weston's report.

706
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,301
RICHARDS; Yes, sir.

707
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,136
Logged off, sir.
He's gone.

708
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,388
An Internet café
on Long Street.

709
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,334
Like a black Dorian Gray.

710
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,503
That's right.
How you doing, brother?

711
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,172
Come in.
Yes, sir.

712
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:36,679
Illana?

713
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:38,472
Hi.

714
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:40,057
We have a guest.

715
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,394
Illana.
Good to meet you.

716
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,062
Joseph, my daughter.

717
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,439
- How are you?
- Hello.

718
01:07:47,523 --> 01:07:48,524
My son-in-law.

719
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:52,945
May I offer you some tea?

720
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,197
No, we're going upstairs.

721
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,336
I remembered.

722
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:12,881
You even let it breathe.

723
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:21,557
"Too long a sacrifice Can
make a stone of the heart"

724
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,895
"O when may it suffice?"

725
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,190
"That is Heaven's part"

726
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,822
In the old days, a cheap bottle

727
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,949
of Flor de Cana kept us
happy all night.

728
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,535
Mmm. Tastes change.

729
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:47,082
People change.

730
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,173
People don't change.

731
01:08:55,424 --> 01:08:57,176
We grow old.

732
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,678
And some of us adapt.

733
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:03,557
And learn how to enjoy
simple pleasures of life,

734
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,770
like a family, a home.

735
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,189
And for you...

736
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,983
What's in that glass
right now, for you,

737
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,444
is as good as it's
ever going to be.

738
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:21,158
One day you'll understand.

739
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,787
You got more past
than future, you learn.

740
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:28,540
What is this?
An intervention?

741
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,340
I thought you were dead.

742
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:53,357
So, what brings you to my home
in the middle of the night

743
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,900
after all these years?

744
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:10,666
Ooh.

745
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,798
Papa?

746
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,341
Uh-huh.

747
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:20,801
We're going.

748
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,386
Okay, be careful.

749
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:23,971
Okay, Papa.

750
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:45,534
What are you
going to do with this?

751
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:48,412
Make some money.

752
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:49,788
Let me borrow your glasses.

753
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:58,589
That's it. Listen.

754
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:03,177
I'm going to need a new passport,
photo ID, driver's license,

755
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,804
the whole shebang.
Can you do that for me?

756
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,056
Yeah.

757
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,143
You sure?

758
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:13,395
Yes.

759
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,738
Weston never
showed at the consulate.

760
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:25,240
And he was just
accessing our secure server,

761
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:28,118
searching for someone
to create an alias package.

762
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,664
<i>He's trying to
leave the country.</i>

763
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,875
Or he's going after Frost.

764
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:38,212
<i>Look at what
happened at the soccer stadium.</i>

765
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:40,756
<i>This guy let Frost escape.</i>

766
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,969
I think Weston's turned.

767
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,638
I know this boy.

768
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:51,225
<i>He's been looking for a
chance to prove himself.</i>

769
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,560
<i>He's trying to bring in Frost.</i>

770
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,688
<i>Come on, David.</i>

771
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,857
You're not seeing the evidence.

772
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,246
Not my best work.

773
01:12:12,454 --> 01:12:15,749
But given the pressure
of time, it's passable.

774
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:17,918
It's good.
I'll wire you the money

775
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,419
as soon as I get out of town.

776
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:24,091
Tobin, don't do this.
It's different.

777
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:27,553
You don't need the trouble,
you don't need the money.

778
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:29,471
You can give it...

779
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:50,576
Carlos!

780
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:52,077
Illana!

781
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:53,412
Carlos!

782
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:54,621
Illana!

783
01:12:58,876 --> 01:12:59,918
Carlos.

784
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,005
Carlos!

785
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:13,473
Go.

786
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:15,475
Go.

787
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:29,323
He's on the roof!

788
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:30,926
Go! Go!

789
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,472
Get in the car!

790
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,670
They think they can
come at me like this.

791
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,589
Have to do it a whole
lot better than that.

792
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:39,554
Shit!

793
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,653
Matt, how'd you find me?

794
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,738
It wasn't that hard.

795
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:15,382
Let's go.

796
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:43,869
Wait, wait, wait.

797
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:58,962
Who do you work for?

798
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:19,065
Who sent you?

799
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,695
Who sent you?
Who sent you?

800
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:26,323
Who?

801
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,033
Vargas.

802
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:29,284
Vargas.

803
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:30,785
Who's Vargas?

804
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:32,412
Who's Vargas?

805
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,709
You want to die?

806
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,256
Who's Vargas?

807
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:48,720
Matt.

808
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,645
CIA.

809
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:02,984
CIA! CIA!

810
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:33,556
Report?

811
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,475
There was a shootout
in the Langa Township.

812
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:39,104
Two crime scenes. One at the
residence of Carlos Villar.

813
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:40,730
He's a document forger.

814
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,399
The other in a nearby tenement.

815
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:43,608
And where was Frost last seen?

816
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:44,818
Tenement.

817
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:46,820
Have fun at Villar's.

818
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,488
We'll meet up later.

819
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,718
You were right about Ana.

820
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:14,431
That's her name.

821
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:18,393
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>

822
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:25,400
Most case officers get
married three, four times.

823
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:29,195
You?

824
01:22:31,906 --> 01:22:33,533
Once.

825
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,714
You're falling apart over here.

826
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:58,224
Don't kill innocent people,
Matthew.

827
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,145
What?

828
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:12,655
Air traffic controller,
a tiny airstrip in Bermuda.

829
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:16,242
George Edwart Cox,
I remember that name.

830
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:18,203
Edwart, With a "T".

831
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:24,083
My inside officer said he was
organizing arms shipments,

832
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:27,962
but he was just an air traffic controller.
He was just a guy.

833
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:30,715
I put a bullet in his skull.

834
01:23:33,927 --> 01:23:37,138
Black Ops came in, they replaced
him with one of their own,

835
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:39,516
and crashed a Gulf stream
in the ocean that night.

836
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:43,311
The thing was, the family
that was on the plane...

837
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:47,815
The husband,
he was a whistleblower.

838
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:51,694
The whole thing was about

839
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:55,323
stopping him from
testifying about wet works

840
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:58,576
to a congressional hearing.

841
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,414
Is that why you left?

842
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:04,666
No.

843
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:10,421
I went back to work the next day
like nothing ever happened.

844
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:16,553
You practice anything a long
time, you get good at it.

845
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:20,223
You tell a hundred lies a day,
it sounds like the truth.

846
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:22,642
Everyone betrays everyone.

847
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:27,730
That's a shitty excuse.

848
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:32,443
Yeah, I used to be
innocent like you.

849
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:35,321
Wrap myself up in the flag...

850
01:24:42,704 --> 01:24:44,664
I'm going to take you in.

851
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:54,841
Good for you.

852
01:25:49,062 --> 01:25:50,146
Barlow.

853
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,106
<i>Witnesses
identified a pair of men</i>

854
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,983
<i>fitting Weston and
Frost's description</i>

855
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:56,110
leaving this location together.

856
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,487
So, he pulled it off.

857
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:00,448
Weston is aiding and
abetting a fugitive.

858
01:26:00,782 --> 01:26:01,949
<i>You're wrong.</i>

859
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:04,619
If he's with Frost, he's
taking him to the safe house.

860
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,496
That's where we got to be.

861
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:08,539
Fine. Fine.

862
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:11,417
Meet me at the crossroads
at Old Malmesbury Road.

863
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:39,862
Who are you?

864
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:41,989
You Weston?

865
01:26:43,658 --> 01:26:45,243
Give me the shotgun.

866
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:46,911
What the hell is this?

867
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:48,079
Who are you?

868
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:50,873
I'm Keller.
Safe house keeper.

869
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,627
Authorization Index, Bravo
Four Seven Oscar Whiskey Six.

870
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:57,630
Inside. Let's go.

871
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,975
To the left.

872
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:12,854
Slowly.

873
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:15,565
I don't know who trained you,
man, but this sure as hell

874
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:17,400
ain't protocol.
Where's the guest room?

875
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,486
That's the thing, we
don't really have one.

876
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:24,449
In there. In there.

877
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:31,164
Cuff him.
To the pipe.

878
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:39,964
Out. Over there.

879
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:41,883
All right.

880
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,511
Control room.

881
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:49,682
Whatever you say, man.
It's your rodeo.

882
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:02,570
Call it in.
Let me hear it.

883
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,790
<i>Landlord</i>

884
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:15,917
My guest is here.

885
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,043
<i>Account?</i>

886
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:18,336
Abaresque Limited.

887
01:28:20,046 --> 01:28:21,088
<i>With a guest?</i>

888
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:22,340
Yeah, package delivered.

889
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:27,178
<i>Confirmed.
Pickup scheduled.</i>

890
01:28:27,762 --> 01:28:29,472
They're on the way.

891
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,393
Can we at least
put the gun down now?

892
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:45,279
Thanks, Clayton. Bye.

893
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:48,908
It's a microchip.

894
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:50,743
What?

895
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,870
That was my guy from MI6.

896
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:54,413
Wade got his hands
on a microchip.

897
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,748
And what was on it?

898
01:28:55,832 --> 01:28:57,041
Only Wade knew,

899
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:58,501
but I think it's safe to assume

900
01:28:58,584 --> 01:28:59,669
that's why he
hooked up with Frost.

901
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:01,254
To sell it.

902
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:03,923
Let's get moving.

903
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:38,457
Long day, huh?

904
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:47,174
I can only imagine.
Tobin Frost.

905
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,428
That man's a legend.

906
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:52,722
I hope you picked up something.

907
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:55,099
You ain't going to
find a better education.

908
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:07,320
This is the most
excitement I've seen.

909
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:09,906
You're the first guest
I've had in 10 months.

910
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,950
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

911
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:14,827
You got a city posting.

912
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,915
Yeah, nightlife, beaches.

913
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:21,667
Little ladies
running around everywhere.

914
01:30:23,878 --> 01:30:25,212
Yeah.

915
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,008
I'm jealous.

916
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:36,641
You got coffee?

917
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:38,392
Yeah, it's in the cupboard.

918
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:39,518
Where?

919
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:41,562
Want me to get it?
I got it.

920
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:03,180
Why are you in Cape Town?

921
01:34:06,142 --> 01:34:08,769
Tell me now. Why?

922
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,236
What is it?

923
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:20,531
A dirt list, laundry list.

924
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:24,785
Israeli Intelligence, five years
ago, compiled blackmail intel.

925
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:29,790
Corrupt agents,
German Intelligence, MI6...

926
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:30,916
CIA?

927
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,710
Yes.

928
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:35,546
We got to get away.

929
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:39,300
We got to get out of here.

930
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,101
Ah, shit.

931
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,870
Don't, don't, don't.

932
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:17,171
No, don't leave me here,
please.

933
01:35:17,296 --> 01:35:18,881
Don't do it.

934
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:05,094
Matt?

935
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:09,390
Hey.

936
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:13,686
How you doing?

937
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,527
I'm proud of you.

938
01:36:24,655 --> 01:36:26,615
And what you pulled off.

939
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,454
You're going to make
a hell of a case officer.

940
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,250
Where's Frost?

941
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:37,960
He's gone.

942
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:45,134
Place is a wreck.
Blood everywhere.

943
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,594
Was he injured or...

944
01:36:51,682 --> 01:36:54,435
I guess you know
he killed Keller.

945
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:56,562
No.

946
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:00,357
I killed Keller.

947
01:37:08,824 --> 01:37:11,076
Frost killed Keller.

948
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,456
He killed Linklater, too.

949
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:22,504
Did he talk about anything?
Anything he was after?

950
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:25,591
Anything he might have had?

951
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:28,260
The file.

952
01:37:29,178 --> 01:37:30,554
The file?

953
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:34,183
The file that you're on.

954
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,273
Along with a lot
of other people.

955
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,108
Important people.

956
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:56,455
Listen to me.

957
01:37:57,414 --> 01:37:59,666
What would you do

958
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,378
if someone is
watching your every move?

959
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:06,423
Some maybe you're not proud of.

960
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:09,968
And you will have some you're
not proud of, believe me.

961
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:12,596
And then tries to
use it against you?

962
01:38:15,182 --> 01:38:17,351
You would do
what you have to do.

963
01:38:18,227 --> 01:38:20,646
You would do
what you have to do.

964
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:29,238
Where's the file?

965
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:40,082
Matt, the file.
Where is the file?

966
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:44,128
You're a dead man.

967
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:46,463
Yeah, a long time now.

968
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:48,382
Frost is here.

969
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:52,506
Let's go.

970
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:17,030
We got him.

971
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,492
A hell of a job.

972
01:41:55,986 --> 01:41:57,362
You smell that?

973
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:00,616
Pinotage. It's a good grape.
Great wine.

974
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:04,745
Local grape.
Pinotage is great...

975
01:42:12,419 --> 01:42:14,838
I don't want you
losing this one.

976
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,300
It's worth a lot of money.

977
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:24,056
You're a good boy, Matty.

978
01:42:26,433 --> 01:42:28,101
You know what you are.

979
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,814
Hey.

980
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:35,734
I know what you're not.

981
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:42,074
You're better than me.

982
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:50,624
No, it's okay,
just be better than me.

983
01:42:55,337 --> 01:42:57,089
You promise me.

984
01:42:58,507 --> 01:42:59,758
Yeah.

985
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:07,683
Well, let's...

986
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:11,728
Let's go.

987
01:43:13,105 --> 01:43:16,608
I just got to get up.
I need to get up.

988
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:19,945
Stay.

989
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:23,865
Stay.

990
01:43:26,952 --> 01:43:28,203
Hey...

991
01:44:44,613 --> 01:44:48,116
That's exactly as it happened.

992
01:44:52,788 --> 01:44:54,498
Obviously, this situation needs

993
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:56,833
to be handled with a
certain amount of finesse.

994
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:58,960
Has anybody else
seen this report?

995
01:44:59,044 --> 01:45:00,962
No, sir. Not yet.

996
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,924
Matt, I'm sure this
comes as no surprise,

997
01:45:04,007 --> 01:45:08,637
but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security.

998
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:11,389
Which parts, sir?

999
01:45:11,473 --> 01:45:12,891
Well...

1000
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:15,519
David Barlow can't
be held responsible

1001
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:17,479
for what happened
to the safe house.

1002
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:20,899
We just don't need the scandal.

1003
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:23,485
But, sir, you and I both know
that, that is just not the truth.

1004
01:45:23,568 --> 01:45:26,154
People don't want
the truth any more, Matt.

1005
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,115
It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.

1006
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,664
I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.

1007
01:45:36,498 --> 01:45:39,584
I think the Agency has
grossly underestimated you,

1008
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:43,797
and I'm recommending you for a
senior case officer position.

1009
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,382
Provided you still want it.

1010
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:48,927
That's a generous offer, sir.

1011
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:53,765
There's just one thing you
need to clarify for me.

1012
01:45:53,849 --> 01:45:55,141
Of course.

1013
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:59,229
Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.

1014
01:45:59,312 --> 01:46:00,647
A file.

1015
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:04,109
I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.

1016
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,326
What was on the file, sir?

1017
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:16,121
Something that, quite frankly,
could be very damaging

1018
01:46:16,204 --> 01:46:18,540
to the Agency
and to our allies.

1019
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:25,839
I don't see why Frost would even
mention something like that to me.

1020
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:33,513
No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?

1021
01:46:37,893 --> 01:46:41,146
You realize, though,
that if that file did leak,

1022
01:46:42,689 --> 01:46:44,816
what would happen
to the person responsible?

1023
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,902
That person would
be arrested, sir.

1024
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:48,820
He'd be risking everything.

1025
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:53,658
He'd have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world.

1026
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:58,830
In the eyes of the CIA, he'd
be just like Tobin Frost.

1027
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:05,587
Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.

1028
01:47:10,842 --> 01:47:12,177
All right, son.

1029
01:47:13,303 --> 01:47:14,888
Take a few days off.

1030
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:16,932
We'll get you
started next week.

1031
01:47:18,767 --> 01:47:20,101
Thank you.

1032
01:47:22,312 --> 01:47:25,273
And think about our
conversation, would you?

1033
01:47:25,523 --> 01:47:27,025
Will do.

1034
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:29,069
I'll take it from here, sir.

1035
01:47:54,678 --> 01:47:55,929
<i>...and other media outlets</i>
