1
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,725
He's coming.

2
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,471
Shall we try it?

3
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:33,981
Look at me, Paul.
Stand taller, be brittle, edgy.

4
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:38,422
A matador relates to death,
to anxiety, so be edgy.

5
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,827
Clara, look down,
be a bit submissive.

6
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,421
Not too much.

7
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,296
A bit submissive to the man.

8
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,668
At three, you look at me.
lt's all in your look.

9
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,870
At three, raise yourself
on your toes and look at me.

10
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,505
One, two, three.

11
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,513
Excellent.

12
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,395
You think l don't suffer, too?

13
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,903
You think l enjoy
seeing you unhappy?

14
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,434
l told you,
l'm always like this.

15
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,708
With other girls it lasted a week,
then for 6 months we did nothing.

16
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,941
Really?

17
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,545
With you,
it's lasted 3 months.

18
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,249
lt's all we've done,
night and day.

19
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,987
Don't exaggerate.

20
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,653
We never did it all night.

21
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,057
Come on.
We'd make love twice in a row.

22
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:59,264
l don't think so.

23
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,500
ln fact,
l think it never happened.

24
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:12,210
Anyway, now l can cheat on you.
But you can't.

25
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,221
No getting a hard-on for another girl,
if you don't for me.

26
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,850
Have you cheated on me?

27
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,689
No.

28
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,697
You're lucky. You won't
make me give up sex.

29
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,565
l haven't cheated on you,
but l should have.

30
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,570
What does that mean?

31
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,104
Look me in the eyes.

32
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,905
- Have you ever?
- Absolutely not.

33
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,912
lt means l'm too dumb.

34
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,513
You don't deserve
my faithfulness.

35
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,510
Know why you drink?

36
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,079
So you can collapse
in bed like a log.

37
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,854
You only love me
when there's a table between us.

38
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,260
Since we met, we've been
together every night.

39
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,267
l've eaten opposite you.

40
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,963
l'm never bored.

41
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,834
Right.

42
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,704
You like me when
there's a table between us.

43
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,617
lt's insane. l sleep over with
a guy who doesn't touch me.

44
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,315
You haven't in ages.

45
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,223
- We discussed that.
- You swore you'd do something.

46
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,126
- Wait.
- For the end of the world?

47
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,653
You have to wait.
Maybe 3 more months.

48
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,757
There's more to life than that.

49
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,373
What are you doing?
You splitting?

50
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,445
No.

51
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,492
lt's not that serious.

52
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,195
Yes, it is.

53
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:06,023
An invisible cage, heavy,
leaden, descends on me...

54
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,987
a tacit interdiction.

55
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,113
Take off your T-shirt.

56
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,817
l don't want to sleep
with a cotton bag, l hate cotton.

57
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,155
No.
Get undressed and come to bed.

58
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,166
Why won't you take it off?

59
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,412
You know l can't stand it,
l feel it against me.

60
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,811
l'll take it off,
but not my shorts.

61
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,684
They keep my balls warm.

62
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,320
lt's nothing to do with you.

63
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,556
l never thought
we'd be together every night.

64
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,257
Anyway, that's how it is.

65
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,866
lt's my fault, too.

66
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:31,675
l thought you'd have other things
to do than see me every night.

67
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,371
We'd not meet
for 2 weeks, a month.

68
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,185
You'd let me disappear.

69
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,549
No.

70
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,528
Not without staying in touch.

71
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,504
Not if you're
in Paris when l am.

72
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,267
You don't trust me.

73
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,150
l'll leave...

74
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,154
lf you want, l'll leave.

75
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,560
You'll never see me again.

76
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,533
See how you are?

77
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,541
We can't even talk.

78
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,372
Get into bed.

79
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,643
Take that off.

80
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,086
l said it's nothing
to do with you.

81
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,021
l've always slept like this.

82
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,485
lt is to do with me.

83
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,463
lt's because you hate me.

84
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,428
Stop it.

85
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,100
l told you never to try that.

86
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,200
You're just postponing things.

87
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,474
- But you're hard.
- Stop, or it's all over between us.

88
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,374
lt means you can.

89
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,249
Doesn't interest me.

90
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,677
Be nice, why won't you?

91
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,773
lf you couldn't get it up,
l'd understand.

92
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,721
You've decided to stop
making love, just when l...

93
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,987
Watch out.

94
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,428
l'll want to kill myself.
l've never done this with a guy.

95
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,364
l never touched them.
Never.

96
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,700
lt must be important to you,
since you harp on it.

97
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,764
Even if you don't want to,
if you can't, l don't get it.

98
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,209
Then caress me. lf you can't
get any pleasure give me some.

99
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,482
Women come
a lot more than men.

100
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,043
lf l did that,
l'd despise you.

101
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,986
l couldn't love you any more.

102
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,196
You despise me
because l'm a woman.

103
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,691
You don't love me one bit.

104
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,503
l disgust you, l appall you.

105
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,442
You think l'm the lowest.

106
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,172
Stop it.

107
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,074
Come to bed.

108
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,956
Why can l only
love him or hate him?

109
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,898
Why can't l feel indifferent?

110
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,403
Yet my head is clear.

111
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,973
A man who can't
love me physically...

112
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,106
is a pit of misfortune,

113
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,310
a gulf of suffering.

114
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,722
They say that a man
who screws a woman, honors her.

115
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,095
The expression
is worth noting: lt's true.

116
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,732
Paul dishonors me.

117
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,677
Do you mind?

118
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,144
On the contrary.

119
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,617
Just came for a nightcap?

120
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,714
l just got out of bed.

121
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,422
lt's true,
l just got dressed.

122
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,466
l can't stand sleeping,
so l got up.

123
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,466
l don't give a damn about time,
l'm never tired.

124
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:28,038
l hate people who feign fatigue,
who have endless pretexts.

125
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,340
You agree?

126
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,482
lt's because they lack passion.

127
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,527
You live alone?

128
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,297
No, l have a husband.

129
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,073
l told him l had a husband...

130
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,546
so he'd know l'm not free.

131
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,444
Because l'm not free.

132
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,553
He'll have to realize
it's adultery.

133
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,297
He's asleep,
sleeping doesn't bother him at all.

134
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,126
He has to get up early tomorrow.

135
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,841
He has a business appointment
in Deauville at noon.

136
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,616
Do you have a girlfriend?

137
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,120
She died in a car accident.

138
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,249
l haven't made love in 4 months.

139
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,624
Maybe all men are like that.

140
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,234
My husband's nice,
but he's not interested in sex.

141
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,263
The first moves
are what l like best.

142
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,490
lt's delicious.

143
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,564
l can never stop
myself from yielding.

144
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,575
lt surprises me each time.

145
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,908
l watch myself giving in
as if it wasn't me.

146
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,106
Frankly...

147
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,644
l wanted another taste of that miracle,
a stranger making love to you.

148
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,158
lt's a childish desire...

149
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,359
a pure desire.

150
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,204
Give me a blow job.

151
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,443
Not now.

152
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,050
This evening or tomorrow.

153
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,723
Give me your phone number?

154
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,059
- You don't feel like it?
- To blow you?

155
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,221
Not really.

156
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,197
lt's not my specialty.

157
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,466
l don't like
to start with that...

158
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,995
l'd rather resume that way,
if you see what l mean.

159
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,002
But going to a hotel,
l'm dying to do that.

160
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,206
Now l have to split,
in fact, right away.

161
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,377
Don't want to go to a hotel?

162
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,512
l have to go to work.

163
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,785
And l have to return the car.

164
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,718
lt's not mine.

165
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,528
Will you call me?

166
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,384
Sorry l'm late.

167
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,979
Doesn't matter.

168
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,957
l took attendance.

169
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,401
Take out your grammar notebooks,
and write today's date.

170
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,819
Last week we did the present
tense of the verb ''to be''.

171
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,756
''l am, you are, he is...''

172
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,285
''we are, you are, they are.''

173
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,794
Today, we'll do, ''to have''.

174
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,370
''To have'' isn't like ''to be''.

175
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,169
One can ''be'' without ''having''.

176
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,946
One can ''have'' without ''being''.

177
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,023
l've been ''had''.

178
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,025
l've really been had.

179
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,196
l wish you were pregnant.

180
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,066
Fat chance of that.

181
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,701
Why?
lt could happen.

182
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,645
How? By the Holy Ghost?
You dreaming?

183
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,547
There's no way,
ever since l stopped the pill.

184
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,880
You hate details,
but there are dates.

185
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:17,161
lf you hardly ever do it, and can't
on the right days, it'll never happen.

186
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,993
That's what depresses me.

187
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,124
That's different.

188
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,065
lf you say it's chore time,
l'll do it.

189
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,776
- Really?
- Yes.

190
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,449
That'd change everything.

191
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:45,116
lf we had a child,
it'd make sense to be together.

192
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,182
lt's because
you've lost faith.

193
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,852
lt'll come back.

194
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,044
lt's like the Circean myth.

195
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:12,209
You want to know the future,
and the past.

196
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,084
You even mess with the present,
you force it.

197
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,915
You've lost faith,
so everything collapses.

198
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,090
What if l left?

199
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:29,497
And didn't phone
for 2 weeks or a month?

200
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,866
Or 6 months?

201
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,996
Would we be through?

202
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,135
Depends.

203
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:44,308
lf you go to the North Pole,
or to a desert, maybe.

204
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,510
But if you see a phone
and always say...

205
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,781
''l won't call that dumb girl''...

206
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,552
and hang out in every bar
in my neighborhood,

207
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,594
l'd say we've broken up.

208
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,494
l talk of freedom,
you talk of bars.

209
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,930
lt's statistics.

210
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,163
A guy needs to remake
the world with his pals in a bar,

211
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,432
or he dies.

212
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,736
You know l don't cheat on you.

213
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:13,209
Maybe l'd rather you did,
and also screwed me.

214
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,483
Anyway, l can cheat on you,
but you can't on me.

215
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,282
You already done it?

216
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,653
You talk about it a lot.

217
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,485
No.

218
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,053
But you deserve to think l have.

219
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,063
Ok.

220
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,602
Tomorrow night,
l'm dining with Ashley.

221
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,639
You can come,
but you know what l'd prefer.

222
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,867
That l didn't come.

223
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,277
l know l should
let him live...

224
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,714
but l need to cling
to him like a leech.

225
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,431
Because l'm madly
in love with him.

226
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,645
What he calls breathing,
suffocates me.

227
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,983
l never asked to be free.

228
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,619
And l don't want
him to be, either.

229
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:44,231
l'm a real stickler
for absolutes.

230
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,236
And l think l'm right.

231
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,004
But when l apply it to life...

232
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,750
it really makes me go schizo.

233
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,566
He dances because
he wants to seduce.

234
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,640
He wants to seduce
because he wants to conquer.

235
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,336
He wants to conquer
because he's a man.

236
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,956
Now what is it?

237
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,629
You make a scene
'cause l dance with a girl?

238
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,969
Not a girl, some bimbo.

239
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,373
Who gives a fuck about her?

240
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,070
Then don't give a fuck.

241
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,649
l won't have
a kid with anyone else.

242
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,728
You insist l wear one?

243
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,724
l haven't screwed in 6 months,
l don't have AlDS.

244
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,568
You're getting better.

245
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,506
You seem to enjoy it.

246
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,071
You're almost triumphant.

247
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,780
You want me to watch
you slip on your condom.

248
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,415
At first you hid.

249
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,688
- Think so?
- l do.

250
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:01,061
l didn't dare look,
l don't like looking at a cock.

251
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,497
Once they've been used,
they're revolting.

252
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,233
Not very pretty.

253
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,940
They are rather disgusting.

254
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,884
lt's like a tampax, to screw,
you take it out discreetly,

255
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,252
hide it under the bed,
so the guy's not turned off.

256
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,087
Guys are easily disgusted.

257
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,184
Later, you have to retrieve it.

258
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,429
l quite like disgusting things.

259
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,247
Know why most guys
can't use a condom?

260
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,488
Their cocks
aren't hard enough.

261
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:08,828
As they say, the rubber,
rubs them out.

262
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,233
l wouldn't know,
l don't sleep with guys.

263
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,136
lt's true,
they go limp all the time.

264
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,438
Because they're
not really horny.

265
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,348
lt's like in porn flicks...

266
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,017
girls stuff limp cocks
in their mouths.

267
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,721
They have to give blow jobs
because they're not really wanted.

268
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,858
A guy should
take you without a word

269
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,963
but he shouldn't bug
you with his inadequacy.

270
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,974
Sometimes a blow job is fine.

271
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,553
lt's ok when the guy
could screw you, but won't.

272
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,427
That's the Tantalus torture.

273
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,629
lt makes you admit
you can do that...

274
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,177
or even worse...

275
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,148
as long as he
ends up screwing you.

276
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:51,897
Most guys have cocks
that are short, thin...

277
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,835
and pointed.

278
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,532
Pointed?

279
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,540
Like a dog's cock.

280
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,880
l hate that.
Length isn't everything.

281
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,542
There's the base.

282
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,779
A thin cock isn't noble.

283
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,906
Shall l stick it in your ass?

284
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,203
Not yet.

285
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:43,177
Screw me some more,
l haven't had enough.

286
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,315
My boyfriend doesn't screw me.

287
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:19,813
How can you love a guy
who doesn't screw you?

288
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,485
l don't like the guys
who screw me.

289
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,187
l hate them.

290
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,119
l don't want to see
the men who screw me.

291
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,187
Or look at them.

292
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,662
l want to be a hole,
a pit...

293
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:17,500
the more gaping,
the more obscene it is,

294
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:23,377
the more it's me,
my intimacy,

295
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,473
the more l surrender.

296
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,246
lt's metaphysical.

297
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:34,020
l disappear in proportion
to the cock taking me.

298
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,292
l hollow myself.

299
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,922
That's my purity.

300
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,144
You like your back
being tickled?

301
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,697
No, l don't like tenderness.

302
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,997
Or to be kissed on the mouth.
l couldn't stand that.

303
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,131
l don't care
who stuffs my cunt.

304
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,539
But l can't kiss
someone l don't love.

305
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,436
lt's too intimate.

306
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,317
But l kissed Paolo,
l felt like it.

307
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,184
When l kissed him,
l stopped thinking about Paul.

308
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,291
So l decided
to stop seeing him.

309
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,592
lt was a question of integrity.

310
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,503
What are you doing?

311
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,069
Nothing.
l have a class.

312
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,841
You like my cock?

313
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,385
- l like its smell.
- You're disgusting.

314
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,218
No, it smells good.

315
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,325
l like it that
it's not too large.

316
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,889
lt fits in my hand
and fits in my mouth.

317
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,401
Why do you like it?

318
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,569
lt's mine.

319
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,006
l don't know...

320
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,107
lt's like a bird.

321
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,513
Feels like l have
a bird in my hand.

322
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,888
You see when
you move like that...

323
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,223
lt's as if it wanted
to fly away.

324
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,593
But it doesn't.
That's touching.

325
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,292
You mind that we don't
go all the way?

326
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,469
What l mind is you won't
let me caress you.

327
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,641
l really resent that.

328
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,147
l do let you caress me.

329
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,479
But not all the way.

330
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,251
Don't worry,
l don't come either.

331
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,027
DlCTATlON

332
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,834
''Winter Months.''

333

''Everyone had settled...

for a life...

335
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,380
that was dull...

336
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,256
and orderly.''

337
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,621

Exclamation point.

00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,779
l know,
my spelling is awful.

How did l pass
my teaching exams?

349
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,215
Or get my driver's license.
l can't parallel park.

350
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,214
That's less serious.

351
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,920
You're not behind me
when l'm double parked.

352

00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,825
Like with math,
my reasoning was fine,

355
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,296
but l couldn't learn
multiplication tables.

356
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,964
That's a problem.

357
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,304
Nice place.

358
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,239
Surprises you, eh?

359
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,505
lt's small,
but it has everything.

360
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,480
Girls want to see
what they've seen on TV.

361
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,541
Sliding Japanese screens are in,
so that's what l have.

362
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,315
Jacuzzis are in,
so l've got one.

363
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,880
For a small place,
it has everything, it's a theater.

364
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:19,089
lt's like a stage
where l can rehearse.

365
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,597
l'm a high class bum
who's not handsome,

366
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,463
yet l've had
over 10,000 women.

367
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,266
Why me?

368
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,968
Because you have
to talk to them.

369
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:35,136
Nobody bothers to talk
to women anymore.

370
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:39,945
l talk, they listen,
they're in the palm of my hand.

371
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:48,482
Then l put my hand
in the right place without asking.

372
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,151
So it goes.

373
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,997
Somebody has
to get things going.

374
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,301
The only way
to be loved by women...

375
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,202
is via rape.

376
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,272
Women yield to a stranger,

377
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:14,909
but play hard to get
with a wretch who loves them.

378
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,577
So it goes.

379
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:22,251
But do they want
to be respected?

380
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,529
ln a sense, yes.

381
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:31,125
But respect
is in the nature of things,

382
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,934
since they're up for grabs,
they want to be taken.

383
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:40,067
l've had 10,000 women,
l don't remember them all,

384
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,580
but l kept their names, their age,
and the circumstances.

385
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,852
Their cunts.

386
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:54,823
No two are alike,
they're as memorable as faces.

387
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,452
But take ten men,
cut off their cocks,

388
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,395
put them in a basket,
no one can tell his own.

389
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,576
l did a radio show.

390
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,809
They wanted
proof of my statistics.

391
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,874
Yes, indeed.

392
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,510
They counted them.

393
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,361
Dr. Weil, a psychiatrist
and sexologist,

394
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,890
knows a true Casanova,
a super Don Juan,

395
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,835
a prince among seducers.

396
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,771
Why does she call me
a prince of seducers?

397
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,365
lt's absurd.

398
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,502
l never seduced anyone,
any woman.

399
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,310
l know
l'm not very handsome,

400
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:56,182
l may even be revolting,

401
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,619
but the fact is,
l've had 10,000 women,

402
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,626
several per day.

403
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:07,494
l've been a seducer
in the sense of ''se aductere''...

404
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,794
to draw to one's self.

405
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,401
We checked him out,
he kept a record of his conquests.

406
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:50,200
l've got something
that will interest you.

407
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,641
l bought it, knowing some day
l'd make you read it.

408
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,803
Here it is.

409
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,211
Read me this sentence.

410
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,314
One shouldn't lend books,
women should read to us,

411
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,446
so we know they've read it.

412
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,332
l hate reading.

413
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,431
Read it.
Women must read to us.

414
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:40,283
''As the Mother begets the Son,
the Son begets the Mother.

415
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:46,592
His act is the creative
counterpoint of the process.

416
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,223
By begetting the Mother,
he purifies her.

417
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:54,566
He purifies her
and himself, uno acto.

418
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:59,371
He turns the ''Babylonian Whore''
into a Virgin.''

419
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:11,316
You're making me shy.
What's come over me?

420
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,913
Yet you're the one who...

421
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,064
l'm fine.

422
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:27,963
You see?

423
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,467
l see nothing.

424
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,577
You're posing.

425
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:59,727
l'm being myself.

426
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:16,174
This kind of embarrassment...

427
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,414
l'm perfectly natural.

428
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:27,359
ls desire.
lt's part of the game.

429
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,136
lf we didn't lack words
when it comes to acts,

430
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:38,436
we'd instantly tell them,
''Hands off'.

431
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:44,003
That's what this is,
a trivial relationship,

432
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,049
a very shameful one.

433
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:53,648
Why do men who disgust us
understand us better

434
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,557
than those who appeal to us?

435
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:03,522
There's a hole in your spelling,
yet, you're a teacher.

436
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,735
Yes, a hole.

437
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,946
There.

438
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:26,082
You're amazed that
l'm fingering your pussy,

439
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,454
but it's me doing it.

440
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,660
l'm not aroused yet,
but you are...

441
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,060
you're amazed it's me.

442
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,796
So it goes.

443
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:41,065
Beautiful women
get taken by ugly men.

444
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,767
That's a well-kept secret.

445
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:48,038
There has to be action,

446
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:52,104
the action isn't between man
and woman, that's too simple.

447
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,146
lt's between
beauty and ugliness.

448
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,284
Beauty feeds on degradation,
communes with it.

449
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,623
That's where l come in,
l make the most of it.

450
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,891
So it goes.
Don't blame me.

451
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,268
Shall l dominate you?

452
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,984
Open your eyes.

453
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,343
Shall l gag you?

454
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,914
lt implies going further...

455
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,289
than it's reasonable
for a woman to accept.

456
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:26,229
She may have to go beyond
what she agreed to.

457
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,965
You don't yearn
for what you can't accept.

458
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:38,907
Physical love is triviality
clashing with the divine.

459
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,824
lt's strange...

460
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,802
obscenity doesn't bother women.

461
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,985
ls it too painful?

462
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,197
Take it off.

463
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:53,064
l can't stand it.

464
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,806
l didn't realize.

465
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,882
You should've told me.
l thought l could go far with you.

466
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:54,623
l can tie you up less severely,
or we can make love normally.

467
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:01,301
l'm ok.

468
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,805
lt's me.

469
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,209
My problem is...

470
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:19,211
You know...

471
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:24,921
nobody ever tied me up before,
l never did it.

472
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,322
Really, you never did?

473
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,499
l always wanted to.

474
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,635
We'll resume.
l won't tie you as tightly.

475
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,334
No.

476
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,848
lt's fine.

477
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,319
lt has to be this way.

478
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,716
Really?
Was it good for you, too?

479
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,559
For me it was very beautiful,
truly beautiful.

480
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,564
l want to give you pleasure.
When you cry, l panic.

481
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:07,626
l feel l've done
something wrong.

482
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:20,380
No, it's fine.

483
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:28,256
At first...

484
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:35,287
you feel your hands going numb,
you think you can stand it...

485
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:43,305
then suddenly it's unbearable.

486
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,549
A form of dying...

487
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,789
a galloping death.

488
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,594
You think your
hands will fall off...

489
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:16,196
you slowly turn
into dead flesh...

490
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:26,710
and then...

491
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:30,617
it has to stop at once,
it can't last a second more.

492
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,763
l was afraid you couldn't hear
because of the gag.

493
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,101
lt's really freaky.

494
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,208
But you liked the gag?

495
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,455
l don't like
having to say things.

496
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,620
When l got home,
Paul wasn't there.

497
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,692
That made my world
fall apart.

498
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,368
lt has nothing to do
with what l did.

499
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,874
What's done is done.
lt's behind me.

500
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,787
My head is very clear.

501
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:46,856
lt's all l can be...

502
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,726
in my head.

503
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,999
l feel my body
doesn't belong to me.

504
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,934
lt's an anonymous appendix.

505
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,475
ln my head, there's Paul.

506
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,501
He could have reconciled me
with my body.

507
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:09,074
But he didn't want to do that.

508
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:14,954
Because l don't like my body,
l was an easy prey.

509
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,454
l mean, a victim.

510
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:25,866
Anyway, women are the victims
men need for atonement.

511
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,940
l always masturbate
with my legs closed,

512
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,541
l rarely part them.

513
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:48,355
l can offer myself to myself,
rape myself.

514
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:54,187
lt's mildly satisfying,
a bit nauseating,

515
01:03:54,263 --> 01:04:01,533
but it's proof l don't need a man
if l have to resort to this.

516
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,207
lt was painful for me
to be on his bed.

517
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:15,516
A pain you could call
feeling like lost luggage.

518
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,587
The more time went by,
the less l could bear it.

519
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:27,585
l had to cast myself out
like a wreck.

520
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:32,066
ln the basic meaning of the word,
up for grabs.

521
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:47,782
The only thing l told myself,
like a two-bit equation,

522
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:52,878
was that if l'd cheated on him,
and still only loved him,

523
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:56,891
it didn't much matter
if he'd cheated on me.

524
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:04,231
But he hadn't. lt was worse,
he was thrilled to be alone.

525
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:18,213
Love between men and women,

526
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,808
let it be said again,
is a devious conflict.

527
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:25,820
There...

528
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,083
l win if l'm last to get home.

529
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:32,454
l know it,
l'll have an edge on him.

530
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,442
$20, just to eat you.

531
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,452
That's my dream.

532
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:06,291
To know that for some guy,
l'm just a pussy he wants to stuff,

533
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,126
without sentimental bullshit.

534
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,462
Just raw desire.

535
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:17,932
To be taken by a guy,
anyone, a nobody,

536
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:25,979
a bum with whom you wallow
for the joy of wallowing,

537
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,451
for the dishonor,
the discredit,

538
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:37,015
that's pleasure to a girl.

539
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,321
Turn over,
show me your rosebud.

540
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,794
Pay me.

541
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,330
You've got no choice, bitch.

542
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,799
- You like me?
- Slut.

543
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:19,701
Whore, bitch.
l reamed you good.

544
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:25,468
l'm not ashamed,
asshole.

545
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:20,458
ls nymphomania
destroying yourself...

546
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:25,762
because you choose a man
who doesn't love you?

547
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,335
l don't want
to sleep with men.

548
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,968
l want to be opened up
all the way,

549
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,239
when you can see that the mystique
is a load of innards,

550
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,440
the woman is dead.

551
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,916
Maybe l really want to meet
''Jack the Ripper'.

552
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,157
He'd certainly dissect
a woman like me.

553
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:33,400
Once again l hung around an hour
so l'd be the last to get home.

554
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:42,166
That's proof that women are capable
of more love than men.

555
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,344
Much more love.

556
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,821
He's waiting for me, too.

557
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:01,255
When l get home after him,
it's not as easy.

558
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,362
The little guy's edgy.

559
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:09,336
- l just got home.
- Me, too.

560
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,373
So l see.

561
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,607
But l just got home, too.

562
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,874
Sure, you wouldn't watch
the idiot box for an hour.

563
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,945
''A Love Affair deals
with an older man's obsession

564
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,148
for a young prostitute''.

565
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,454
So he won't screw me.

566
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,994
''Maybe due to his education,

567
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:36,190
women always
seemed strange to him.

568
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,497
He preferred the company
of his friends.

569
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,972
Women were from another world,
somewhat superior.''

570
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:57,179
My cunt is swollen and moist,
l can hold out forever.

571
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,648
He won't beat me down this way.

572
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,193
When he wants an evening
without me...

573
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,493
l make the most of it.

574
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,396
l get tied up.

575
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:15,736
lt's his fault.

576
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,940
Shall l dominate you?

577
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,951
Want to tie me up?
Today, you choose.

578
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,688
l don't want to do anything.

579
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,787
You like being tied up?

580
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,419
Yes, but not my elbows.

581
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,931
Last time, my hands
were numb for 2 weeks.

582
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,126
A month ago,
one elbow still felt weird.

583
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,692
That's abnormal.
You've got bad circulation.

584
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,721
One day in Cannes,
l picked up Grace Delly.

585
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,518
lf l'd known it was her,
l wouldn't have dared.

586
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:47,722
But she liked me and made a date
to meet at my place.

587
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:52,290
She rang,
blonde, impeccable hairdo,

588
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,836
in a hound's tooth tailleur.

589
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,837
A bitch for a hound dog.

590
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:01,433
l screw her, love in the afternoon,
she leaves in fine spirits.

591
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,671
Next day l see her,
l was with a friend.

592
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,408
l tell him
l screwed that woman.

593
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,781
He says,
''You screwed Grace Delly''?

594
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,911
l looked at him,
l didn't know.

595
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:15,548
See? l'm not handsome...

596
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:18,320
or wealthy or attractive,

597
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,555
but l screwed her.

598
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,988
Later, l went over to her...

599
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,127
we have a drink...

600
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:29,761
and l ask her, why?

601
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,639
''Why didn't you say
you were Grace Delly?''

602
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,946
''Would you have behaved
the same way?''

603
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,645
l guess not.

604
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,178
You don't act the same way
with Grace Delly,

605
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,282
you wear kid gloves.

606
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,015
What a pity,
that was nice.

607
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,847
Wait.

608
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,016
This doesn't hurt.

609
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,387
Too bad,
l don't have two.

610
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,593
Doesn't matter...

611
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:30,495
l'll do it this way.

612
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:40,437
There, raise your ass.

613
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:44,536
l'll lift your skirt.

614
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,547
Like that.

615
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:50,382
l'll spread your legs, ok?

616
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,381
l think you like it
when l spread your legs.

617
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,918
- Wait.
- l love it.

618
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,870
There.

619
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,915
That's nice.

620
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,382
Now l'll put this on.

621
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,153
Wait.

622
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,625
Help me.

623
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,639
That's beautiful.

624
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,876
You're lovely like that.

625
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,385
lt's beautiful.

626
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,544
Now l'll gag you.

627
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,298
l enjoyed it so much,
l grew attached to Robert.

628
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:32,609
Tying me up without tying me down,
was the secret of his ritual.

629
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,983
After these sessions
l wasn't gloomy, we giggled.

630
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:41,045
We partied and overate.

631
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,818
The guy was flat broke.

632
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,426
So she said to him...

633
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,430
you want more caviar?

634
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,402
More caviar?

635
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,268
Waiter, please.

636
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,831
More caviar.

637
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,206
And vodka.

638
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,407
l love to tipple.

639
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:12,681
But l never get drunk,
or what they call drunk.

640
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:22,486
Can we have
some more vodka, too?

641
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,911
You seem fine.

642
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,307
You see your pals.
Me, my girlfriends.

643
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,544
l bet you badmouth us.

644
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:47,918
We badmouth you,
we do, we don't.

645
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,991
Help me?

646
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,279
Caress me.

647
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,414
l can't, you kept it on.

648
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,054
lf that's all it takes.

649
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,961
Love is dumb.

650
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,903
lt's just a power trip.

651
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:41,306
A guy you're faithful to,
won't screw you.

652
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:45,171
Cheat on him,
and he screws you.

653
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:49,178
They don't guess you're cheating...

654
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,219
they sense you're getting away.

655
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,057
My fists are closed.
l can't do a thing.

656
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,894
Now what?
What's this act?

657
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:27,052
Why can't you see
l only do this with you?

658
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:32,090
l've never touched
anyone's cock.

659
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,060
Then why won't you
leave me alone?

660
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,120
Because you do nothing.

661
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:41,565
Now...
you be me.

662
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:46,539
You be the woman,
l'll be your guy, l'll screw you.

663
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,077
Can you believe it?

664
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:57,050
That's how that selfish bastard
got me pregnant.

665
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,887
Nobody came,
not even him.

666
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:05,551
He did a Virgin Mary stunt on me,
with a drop of seminal fluid.

667
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,331
Let your legs fall.
Relax, there.

668
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,373
The neck is closed, good.
The uterus is...

669
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,248
lt's been 8 weeks.

670
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,717
Your turn.

671
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:05,843
That's how l became a case study
for pimply interns.

672
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,088
A slab of meat.

673
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:15,426
Once you're pregnant,
they spread your legs

674
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,761
and peer all the way
up your vagina.

675
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,906
Then l took
a bitter liking to it.

676
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:38,247
As l'd made a truce with Robert
while l was pregnant,

677
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,982
nobody else touched me.

678
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:44,355
My only sexual relationships
became my monthly visits.

679
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:51,192
l'm uneasy on an exam table,
l resent spreading my legs.

680
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,235
That's why it affects me.

681
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,743
l'm a bit of an ice-maiden.

682
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:10,084
l see why the Chinese used
an ivory replica to probe your body.

683
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,018
Though even that's distasteful.

684
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:19,251
Porn movies, too, protect your libido,
you watch a surrogate image.

685
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:24,863
But what you can't tolerate,
you can't tolerate in images, either.

686
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:30,665
An image, is just as compromising,
since it stands for you.

687
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,627
Very good.

688
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,368
Paul is right.

689
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,709
You can't love a face
if a cunt goes with it.

690
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,975
A cunt doesn't go with a face.

691
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:19,044
l fantasize about a brothel...

692
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,680
where a head
is separated from a body,

693
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:27,791
by a guillotine-like contraption
before the blade comes down.

694
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,664
Of course, there's no blade.

695
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:39,302
l wear a silky red skirt
that billows up and rustles.

696
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:43,003
And those silly trappings
that give men a hard-on.

697
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:48,748
lt's proof a hard-on
doesn't mean they love us.

698
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:53,151
Paul is right, being a woman
has a fatal flaw.

699
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:56,247
lf she gets you hard,
you want to bone her.

700
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:59,418
Wanting to bone her
is to despise her.

701
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,361
Love between men and women
is impossible.

702
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:07,664
Men you can't see,
you imagine coarse and ape-like.

703
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,961
Aziz, look at my cock.

704
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,738
As if crudeness
is all one can expect.

705
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:28,013
There we see the head...

706
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:33,220
that was the spine,
the thigh bone.

707
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,660
Want to know what it is?

708
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,357
lt's a boy.

709
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,559
Fabulous.

710
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,998
You want me to marry you?

711
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,314
Yes.

712
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:09,024
That night, Paul made love to me
for the first time in ages.

713
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:22,435
And for the last time.

714
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:29,413
From then on he lugged me around
like a ball and chain,

715
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:32,647
a duty he had to endure.

716
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,689
We went out every evening...

717
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,248
with his sister and brother-in-law.

718
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,988
Now that l was
the mother of his son,

719
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:42,893
l'd met his whole family.

720
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,694
You ok?

721
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,971
Two whiskies.

722
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:32,875
- You ok?
- Fine.

723
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,744
Want another drink?

724
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,676
Later.

725
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,730
Please don't make a scene.

726
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,742
No scene.

727
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,438
l felt like dancing,
so l grabbed a girl.

728
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,044
l almost kissed her,
she was so hot for me.

729
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,952
Then l dumped her
where l picked her up.

730
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:48,682
She never knew what happened.

731
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,616
So you can't complain.

732
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:55,829
l didn't.

733
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,694
But secretly you do.

734
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,310
A whisky, please.

735
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:35,927
You two quit loving each other?

736
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:39,029
You hold her like a deadbeat.

737
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,846
Sit down.

738
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,075
Not too tired?

739
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,741
l'm fine.

740
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:17,434
She's my sister,
but l'll tell her.

741
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:22,974
That a man likes a challenge.

742
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:26,044
He hates being followed around.

743
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:29,008
He needs to fear
he may lose her.

744
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,710
Then he chases her.

745
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:33,853
Or chases someone else.

746
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,718
A man's always chasing.

747
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,524
You agree?

748
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,495
You and your chasing's a bore.

749
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:16,893
The bastard.

750
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:21,296
He leaves me alone
with my anxiety...

751
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,930
that soon my vagina will expand
and expel the baby.

752
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:31,576
Wake up.

753
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,542
l'm sick of your boozing.

754
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,112
You slob,
you dumb male model.

755
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:02,242
Be right down.

756
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,177
What's going on?

757
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,009
You'll like it.

758
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:22,657
Get on the table.
Wait for the contraction to pass.

759
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,426
Breathe deeply.

760
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,596
Breathe.
Once it's over, get on the table.

761
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,172
- No, the father can't stay.
- Yes, he can.

762
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,475
Am l getting an epidural?

763
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:44,848
lt's too late,
your baby's being born.

764
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:49,418
Ready? We're going to
push out the baby.

765
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,321
lnhale.

766
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:54,953
lnhale, hold your breath,
grab the bar.

767
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,361
Push hard, again.

768
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:01,024
With all your might,
hold your breath, more.

769
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,570
lt's incredible to create life.

770
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:21,886
lnhale.

771
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:25,948
Hold your breath and push.
Go on.

772
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:29,653
They say a woman isn't a woman
till she's a mother.

773
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,756
lt's true.

774
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,927
Nothing that happened before
really matters.

775
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:54,711
For Christine Pascal.

776
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:59,281
l gave my son
his father's name.

777
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:03,289
lf someone up there counts souls,
then we're even.
