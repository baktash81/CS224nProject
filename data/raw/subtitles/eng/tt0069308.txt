29
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,009
Hi.

30
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,391
Now you trust me.

31
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,345
I'm the one human friend you have.

32
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,552
Hi, Stanley.

33
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,054
How are you?

34
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,174
How you doing today?

35
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,760
Hey sweetheart, where's Hazel?

36
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:24,021
Where's...?

37
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:26,148
I got something for you.

38
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:31,028
Yes, I'm gonna be so gentle.

39
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,450
In your condition, yeah.

40
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,120
You're gonna be a mommy.

41
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,239
What do you think about that, Stanley?

42
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:43,874
You're gonna be a daddy.

43
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,709
What's that?

44
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:50,456
You like that, sweetheart?

45
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,875
You're gonna get jealous.

46
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,551
Well, it's okay.

47
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:59,173
It's all right.

48
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,099
Would you like to?

49
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,809
Okay.

50
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,724
All right, Stanley.

51
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:13,479
Hey, how's my little family?

52
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,582
I know.

53
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,802
Come on.

54
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,562
I know.

55
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:48,847
You all want out, well come on.

56
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:52,442
Yeah, baby.

57
00:07:58,107 --> 00:07:59,157
Come on.

58
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,410
Let's go, okay.

59
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:03,787
Okay, come on.

60
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,879
Oh, poor baby.

61
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:24,141
Well, come on.

62
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,229
Tim.

63
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,522
Tim Ochopee?

64
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:56,900
Tim?

65
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:46,400
It has been too long since
we've seen you, Tim Ochopee.

66
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:55,993
My sister made this for you.

67
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,794
I thank you, tell her for me.

68
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,463
Your friends have wondered
if you have forgotten

69
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,716
it is the season of the green corn dance.

70
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,262
We have missed you at our village.

71
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,690
I mean no offense, Wachula.

72
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:22,068
My friends here need me more.

73
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:26,523
Our tribe now calls
you the lover of snakes.

74
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:27,866
The snake man.

75
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:30,160
Think I care?

76
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,404
What has happened to you, Tim Ochopee?

77
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,324
Was it being forced to go
fight the white man's war?

78
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:36,625
What do you think?

79
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:38,827
Two years of whites telling the red man,

80
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:41,588
"kill the yellow."

81
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,876
It kinda screwed up my sense
of equality and brotherhood.

82
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,970
It's in the past now.

83
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,049
The Seminole Indian is
a dying race of humans.

84
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,725
We number few these days.

85
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:57,763
Come back to our village, live with us.

86
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:00,891
Help us survive a few more decades.

87
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:04,061
And work in a trading post?

88
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,029
And if I get married,

89
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,189
have the tourists gawk
at my wife and children?

90
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,534
No.

91
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,778
Ever since I saved this
little fellow's life,

92
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:16,740
he's taught me the meaning
of love and friendship.

93
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,294
His common foe is mine.

94
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:30,629
I will pray that this
cancer of hatred in your heart

95
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,756
will eat no more of your soul away.

96
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,560
Our village will always
be ready to welcome you,

97
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:47,479
if you ever wish to come back to us.

98
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:32,699
Hey, Tim boy!

99
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,568
Hey, how have you been?

100
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,653
How long you been back from Vietnam?

101
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:37,788
Six months.

102
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:38,831
What's that, boy?

103
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:40,040
Six months.

104
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,874
Six months?

105
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:41,708
Well, why in the hell

106
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,293
didn't you give me a call at the factory?

107
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:44,586
I told you I had a job there

108
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,288
whenever you wanted it, didn't I?

109
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:47,714
I didn't want it.

110
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:48,715
Oh, come on, boy.

111
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:49,633
You're not holding a grudge

112
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,418
because of what happened
to your father, are you?

113
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:53,545
The courts cleared your man, I didn't.

114
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:59,009
We was hunting alligators
for Mister Thomkins here.

115
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:00,185
If your dumb Injun father

116
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,645
hadn't been fishing in a hunting area,

117
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,146
he wouldn't have got shot.

118
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,233
Anybody can tell the difference

119
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,643
between a man and an alligator.

120
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:09,695
When it comes to an Injun,

121
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:11,396
you can't tell a difference between them

122
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,440
and a stinking snake in the grass.

123
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:15,533
Maybe.

124
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,362
Now, Crail, you just
stop irritating this boy,

125
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:20,530
even though his father
was off the reservation,

126
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,374
fishing on land leased to us.

127
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:23,417
I mean, it was an accident,

128
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:25,869
you and Bob shooting him in that and all.

129
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:28,080
After all, you did kill the boy's father.

130
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:32,834
He was sitting in some
bushes and he started moving.

131
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:33,802
Crail?

132
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,171
Yeah, Mister
Thomkins, we killed him.

133
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,133
The whole thing's just a terrible mess.

134
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:41,768
It's getting hot and humid, Tim.

135
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,471
Hey, suppose we have a nice,
cool drink inside your place,

136
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:45,731
forget all this.

137
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,474
We got a lot to talk about.

138
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:48,983
Come on, Tim.

139
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:06,535
Just as well as we have a little talk

140
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,620
outside in the great outdoors, huh, Tim?

141
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:10,964
Look, Tim,

142
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:12,591
I've always regretted what
happened to your father,

143
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,543
and I'd have made it up to
you right afterwards and all,

144
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:15,928
if you hadn't got drafted.

145
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:18,130
So now you just let me
make amends, huh, boy?

146
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:20,933
When Doctor Everett told
me you were back here

147
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:21,892
living in the Everglades,

148
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,310
trapping snakes for his medical center,

149
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,186
I said to myself,

150
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,520
now here's a way for me to help Tim

151
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,022
and have old Tim help me, too.

152
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,106
I mean, we both know no one

153
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,975
can catch more snakes faster than you.

154
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,818
I'm gonna need 'em this year, boy.

155
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,146
Some fag fashion designer in Paris,

156
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,773
he publicly said animal skins is "in" now.

157
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:37,824
You know what that means, boy?

158
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,526
That means it'll be the
greatest season I ever had.

159
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,536
And you could be part of it.

160
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:45,490
Look at your vest and your belt.

161
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,578
You thrive off the skins
of living creatures.

162
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,505
I catch snakes for Doctor Everett

163
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:53,498
so the venom can be used medically,

164
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,301
and I don't hurt 'em in any way.

165
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,469
Yeah.

166
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,796
Everything is just so much crap,
boy, until you get to this.

167
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,223
Take it, boy.

168
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:03,717
You can't buy my father's life.

169
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,685
My money.

170
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,270
You'll never buy back
your guilt for his death.

171
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,513
Maybe you'd like to join your
old man in that money grab.

172
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:10,232
Quick, the money's
going down in the water.

173
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,192
Get that money down in the water!

174
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,812
Get the 50's, get that
50, get it all together.

175
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:20,317
All you minorities are
the same in this country,

176
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,868
you know that?

177
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,987
You just live to be hated by other people.

178
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,199
That way, you can cover up
and justify your mistakes

179
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:28,792
by saying you never had a chance.

180
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,001
Am I right, boy?

181
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:32,337
That's bull.

182
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,748
White man, that's bull.

183
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:35,799
I don't need you.

184
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,709
I'll get those snakes with or without you.

185
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,544
It's your choice and your loss.

186
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,505
So don't make the wrong choice.

187
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,590
Come on Crail, let's get out of here.

188
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:04,653
I'll be seeing you again, Injun.

189
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,224
Hey, Stanley.

190
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,086
Hey, Stanley.

191
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:58,757
Hey.

192
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:01,001
Hey, sweetheart, look, look.

193
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:02,969
Snakelets.

194
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,472
You're beautiful.

195
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,509
I'm the first human being you've seen.

196
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,857
Hazel, they're gorgeous.

197
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:20,312
And you, you little mama, you did it.

198
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:21,571
Come here.

199
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,066
You sweet, little mommy.

200
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,245
Come here.

201
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:29,829
I want you to take a rest.

202
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:32,749
You deserve it.

203
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:34,626
My little Hazel.

204
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:37,787
How do you feel, Stanley? You're a daddy.

205
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:39,380
You like that?

206
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:42,300
Oh, yes.

207
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,549
I think the only beauty in this world

208
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,263
is when man isn't there.

209
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,226
Now I'm sorry, Stanley,

210
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:35,345
but you're gonna have
to stay in the truck.

211
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,266
People just don't understand
friendly rattlesnakes.

212
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,360
All right?

213
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,271
See, Tim, we must be very careful

214
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:21,182
in order to avoid injury
to the snake's mouth.

215
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,309
You know how important it is to me.

216
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:25,770
Come on in my office,
I have a check for you.

217
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:37,249
Make yourself comfortable.

218
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,208
Thank you, Doctor.

219
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,999
You have no idea what an
aide you've been so far.

220
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,084
The new snakes you brought have given us

221
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:51,087
an average of 15, 20 drops
of venom each milking.

222
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:55,216
We're quickly replenishing
our supply of serum.

223
00:20:58,386 --> 00:20:59,521
It's ironic, isn't it?

224
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,106
That we need the poison from a snake

225
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:03,183
to create serum in order
to combat the poison

226
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:04,692
from that same snake.

227
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:10,648
Well, Tim, here's your check
for your current delivery.

228
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,195
Glad my snakes have been
a help to you, doctor.

229
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:17,747
Are you all right, Tim?

230
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,957
Why did you tell Thomkins where I was

231
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,467
and what I was doing?

232
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,128
I just thought you
could use the extra money.

233
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,839
No animals should be
slaughtered needlessly.

234
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,219
He killed my father getting
hides to make shoes.

235
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:41,313
Alligators for shoes.

236
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:44,140
The next thing they'll kill
people to make soap out of them.

237
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,026
Come on, Tim.

238
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:51,189
You're taking life much too seriously.

239
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,691
God put every living
creature on this earth

240
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:56,402
to be of some service to
every other living creature.

241
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:59,247
Maybe your God, but not mine.

242
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:01,207
The next thing you'd be telling me

243
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,117
is that all animals are created equal,

244
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:06,746
and that we should treat a
rattlesnake as thy neighbor.

245
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:20,927
I don't know.

246
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,812
Stanley.

247
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:38,069
Don't shoot that snake.

248
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,574
This one of your pets?

249
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,536
This is Stanley.

250
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,247
Now, I told you to stay inside the truck.

251
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,667
Look, if you don't behave,

252
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,003
I won't be able to take
you into town again.

253
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:59,632
Playing with rattlesnakes
is like playing with fire.

254
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:01,058
I ought to know, Tim.

255
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:03,595
I've had enough bad experiences with 'em.

256
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:06,097
You can't tell when they'll strike on you.

257
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:09,517
That's just as true
with people, isn't it?

258
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:12,186
You're a very stubborn
fellow, aren't you?

259
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,946
What he means is, I'm a dumb Indian.

260
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,173
Sorry.

261
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,258
She only bites

262
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,587
girls and doctors.

263
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,487
Hey, hey, hey.

264
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:58,691
What do you say we go see Gloria, huh?

265
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:00,701
Want to see Gloria?

266
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,946
Let's go see Gloria.

267
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,694
Stanley...

268
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:38,690
Now Stanley, just wait a minute now, whoa.

269
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:42,944
Now, where you gonna stay
this time when I leave you?

270
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:45,871
Okay.

271
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,381
Tim, how's it going, baby?

272
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:04,640
Good.

273
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:27,830
Hey, come on, baby.

274
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:33,461
Take it off.

275
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:38,883
Take it all off.

276
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:27,140
I don't believe it.

277
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,802
Those are not real snakes.

278
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:32,970
I've seen snakes before

279
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:37,225
and those are not real

280
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,739
snakes.

281
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:46,617
Yeah.

282
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:49,654
Like father, like son.

283
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:53,366
Stay away, get away, get away.

284
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,334
Oh, words

285
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,621
that you don't mean, Timmy.

286
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,005
Get away from me.

287
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,918
Hey, what's going on here?

288
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:07,797
Is my wife cheating on me?

289
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,757
I brought her some snakes.

290
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,719
I just bet you did, Kemosabe.

291
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,307
Stuff it, Sidney,
you're not being funny.

292
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:19,984
Neither are you, honey.

293
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:23,521
Boy, you really packed them out today.

294
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:35,449
You get the feeling...

295
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,002
you're over the hill?

296
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:40,463
Oh, come on, Sidney,

297
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:42,498
you know it's outta season.

298
00:27:42,832 --> 00:27:46,169
And Miami outta season without
a convention is always dead.

299
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:49,130
Miami's not dead, Gloria.

300
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:51,683
You are.

301
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:52,808
Yeah?

302
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,978
Have you ever stopped to think that maybe

303
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:58,055
it's the rotten publicity
you've been giving me?

304
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:59,524
It's okay.

305
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:02,685
Rotten publicity for a rotten act.

306
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:03,944
Gloria.

307
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,356
Just be nice to my snakes, okay?

308
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:14,864
Snakes alive.

309
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:18,543
I haven't heard a straight line like that

310
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:20,328
since the Garden of Eden.

311
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:26,584
When the snake set Eve up
with my homosexual friend,

312
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:29,837
the forbidden fruit.

313
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:33,633
See you around, Timmy,

314
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:37,762
and try to remember, any type of love

315
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,855
is better than any kind of hate.

316
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:49,657
Hey.

317
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:54,487
This dummy with his snakes

318
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,491
just gave me a great new idea
for an act for you, Gloria.

319
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:01,002
What an act.

320
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,371
Gloria, you'll be on top again.

321
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,542
We'll pack 'em in, this act'll kill 'em.

322
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:50,793
Stanley, you get in trouble

323
00:29:51,127 --> 00:29:53,129
even when you stay in
the truck, don't you?

324
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:09,687
What's he up to?

325
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:11,530
Come on, Stanley.

326
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:39,383
Look at all those future belts.

327
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,221
Well, not this time.

328
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,018
What's he doing nosing around the truck?

329
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:33,070
I don't know.

330
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,939
I don't know. I don't trust him, though.

331
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,699
We'd better check.

332
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:58,387
All the snakes.

333
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:06,387
That swamp booger turned
all our snakes loose.

334
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,231
What?

335
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:10,433
Where do you think
you're going, red stick?

336
00:32:24,947 --> 00:32:26,082
Get up, Bob.

337
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:27,992
Get the gun, Crail.

338
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:33,122
Get the gun from the truck.

339
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:10,334
You wanna know something
about your father, boy?

340
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:11,168
Easy, Bob.

341
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:12,295
No!

342
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:14,088
He's no one ain't gonna hurt us.

343
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:16,624
He wouldn't wanna
incriminate his own father.

344
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:19,835
Now, you pay full attention, boy.

345
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:21,595
That was no accident.

346
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:23,422
It was no accident we shot your father.

347
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:26,342
No, we did it on purpose
and called it an accident.

348
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,645
He was helping us poach animals

349
00:33:29,845 --> 00:33:31,439
off your own people's reservation.

350
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,140
He said he needed the
money Thomkins give him

351
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:34,817
to keep you in college.

352
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:37,645
And he wanted to quit when you graduated.

353
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,113
Thomkins said no.

354
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:41,482
And when he threatened to go to the law,

355
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,200
we killed him!

356
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,988
Now you're gonna get what you
give me a few minutes ago.

357
00:33:49,406 --> 00:33:50,908
Hey, Bob, look out.

358
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:02,595
All right, now you get in that truck

359
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:04,055
and you get the hell outta here.

360
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:05,765
Now, if I ever catch either one of you

361
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,475
hunting and trapping in
these swamps again, I'll --

362
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:08,934
Get me to a hospital.

363
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:11,595
Get me to a damn hospital, Crail.

364
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,890
Now you tell more lies about my father,

365
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,851
and I'll kill you so slow.

366
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,895
You better get that poison outta his tail.

367
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:21,897
Maybe he'll be to sit
down in about a week.

368
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,358
I'm gonna remember
you for this, red stick.

369
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,778
Hell, I want you to remember.

370
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,788
Every time you sit down.

371
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,540
Now move.

372
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:00,736
Come on.

373
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:23,000
Thank you, Stanley.

374
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:32,768
Did you ever have the feeling

375
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:35,262
that life was just one, long joke?

376
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,100
I'm about to laugh.

377
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,336
Hey, it was a night I'll never forget.

378
00:36:08,295 --> 00:36:10,005
Practice makes perfect, Vicky.

379
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:15,427
Yeah, I guess you've had
a lot of that, all right.

380
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,395
A little bit.

381
00:36:16,595 --> 00:36:17,563
Take it easy.

382
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:18,689
Be good.

383
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:22,309
Going home after a hard night's work?

384
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,603
Hmm, getting cold around here.

385
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,647
Give me a call... anytime.

386
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:56,810
Well, maybe he's out back.

387
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,437
Takes a swim every morning.

388
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:08,439
Hey, baby, where's the action?

389
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:14,403
You're getting to be some
nice looking girl, Susie.

390
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:17,614
Come on, cool it, dad.

391
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:19,458
I'm your daughter, remember?

392
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:22,745
Not one of your cheap, young
lays you just said goodbye to.

393
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:23,712
Come on, Susie.

394
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:25,630
Don't talk to me that way, please.

395
00:37:27,082 --> 00:37:29,251
You dirty old man.

396
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:30,761
I hate you.

397
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:33,722
All the sharp fathers in this earth,

398
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:36,675
and I get stuck with a creep like you.

399
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:39,136
You know, you sound like
your mother used to sound.

400
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,104
Maybe I oughta --

401
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:41,688
Beat up on me like you did her?

402
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:44,558
Don't you dare try it.

403
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:45,943
I'll be 18 in two months

404
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:49,021
and I'm blowing this zoo
you call life for good.

405
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,148
You won't bring me back like last time.

406
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,650
Listen, tramp, you do
sound like your mother.

407
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:57,696
In fact, you sound like all
the women in this damn world.

408
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,159
That's my groovy old daddy hypocrite.

409
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,161
You're a swinger when you hop into bed,

410
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,163
but I'm a tramp 'cause
I know where it's at

411
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:07,756
and grab for it, too.

412
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:08,799
Susie, what do you want?

413
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:11,919
I've given you everything a
kid possibly could dream of.

414
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:15,506
Your idea of a dream is
my idea of a nightmare.

415
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:17,850
Well, you're my kinda action.

416
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,975
I can handle you.

417
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,553
You can't afford my kind of action.

418
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:25,357
Why don't you try me?

419
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:27,275
Oh, get lost.

420
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,233
Real card-carrying pro there, huh, Bob?

421
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:35,492
Yeah.

422
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:38,871
What do you want from me, Susie?

423
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:40,289
Will you please tell me?

424
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,041
Is it my fault that your mother ran off

425
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:43,951
with another man and deserted us, huh?

426
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:45,002
It's my fault, too,

427
00:38:45,202 --> 00:38:47,746
that we can't talk to each
other without ever fighting?

428
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,791
It's my fault you think the
way I make a living stinks?

429
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:52,676
You know what's happening, Susie?

430
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:55,420
This generation gap
jock, that's what it is.

431
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:59,508
The only gap between us

432
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:02,803
is the one right here in your head.

433
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:05,897
Thanks, Susie.

434
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:10,018
Thanks, that -- that -- that really hurt.

435
00:39:10,352 --> 00:39:11,278
Gee, dad.

436
00:39:12,354 --> 00:39:14,857
That's exactly what I
said to Freddy last night.

437
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,202
When I let him have it in
the back seat of his car

438
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:19,327
at the drive-in.

439
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,613
You smartass.

440
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:22,998
Hi, Mister Thomkins.

441
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,210
Hello, Susie.

442
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:29,922
I knocked on the front door

443
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:32,916
but nobody answered, I
figured you'd be out back.

444
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,544
You know I take a swim
every morning, Crail.

445
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:38,180
Excuse me.

446
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,091
Would you like something to drink, Bob?

447
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,018
Nothing for me, ma'am.

448
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:45,020
What you got?

449
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:47,147
How about something

450
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,149
nice and warm?

451
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:53,696
Sounds great.

452
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,238
Come with me.

453
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:58,116
What a pleasure.

454
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:13,882
Here's your coffee, Crail.

455
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,343
Thank you, Susie.

456
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:24,935
When can I see you again?

457
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:26,729
Tonight at eight?

458
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,605
I'll meet you at the same place.

459
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:32,067
Sounds great.

460
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:35,738
Really great.

461
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:37,648
Hey Crail, you got two eyes.

462
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:39,616
You wanna try for none, boy?

463
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,152
Susie, get your tail into the house.

464
00:40:42,486 --> 00:40:43,954
Move I said, girl.

465
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,340
Stay clear of my daughter, Crail.

466
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,636
You screw her and you're screwing me, too.

467
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,104
You understand me?

468
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:11,056
Are you kidding, Mister Thomkins?

469
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,267
She's like my kid's sister.

470
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:16,561
Don't con me, Crail.

471
00:41:25,112 --> 00:41:25,954
Well, to what do I owe

472
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:27,247
that I should start my day off

473
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:28,832
with a visit from you two?

474
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,000
Why am I lucky?

475
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:33,620
Well, we had a little trouble
in the glades yesterday.

476
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:35,539
What do you call a little trouble?

477
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,509
We caught that dumb Injun bastard

478
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,252
turning all our snakes loose.

479
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,386
He what?

480
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:42,596
He turned the snakes loose.

481
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:43,847
We beat him up.

482
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:46,182
Bob here got a little...

483
00:41:48,427 --> 00:41:49,311
Yeah?

484
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:51,805
He got a little excited
and got carried away

485
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:54,391
and told him the truth about his old man.

486
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,151
He told him the truth?

487
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:58,061
You big-mouthed idiot fool.

488
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,566
Sore-assed fool now.

489
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:05,577
One of his snakes bit me.

490
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:08,121
That Injun's snake bit you?

491
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:11,783
He's got a thing about snakes, man.

492
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,996
I'd love to get my hands on his cabin.

493
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:18,415
But we don't figure he is
gonna say anything, though.

494
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:19,842
He wouldn't want anybody to know the truth

495
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,176
about his old man.

496
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,970
I'll tell you what he can do,

497
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,505
he could start laying
you out in those swamps.

498
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,432
He knows them and the
animals in them better

499
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,926
than any white or red man put together.

500
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,845
He could sabotage your every move.

501
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:35,640
Hell, he can kill you if he wants to.

502
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:43,440
Hell, he can kill me just
for revenge if he wants to.

503
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,776
Well, that's why me and Bob here figured

504
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:49,696
you might let us hire Marty
Simpson for our next hunt.

505
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,955
Simpson?

506
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,950
You mean the guy they call
Psycho at the factory?

507
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:56,586
I admit, he's a little crazy.

508
00:42:58,413 --> 00:42:59,464
A little crazy?

509
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,333
That guy is capable of doing anything.

510
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:06,963
But he's a good tracker.

511
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,848
And he hates Injuns.

512
00:43:10,592 --> 00:43:14,012
If that Ochopee SOB comes
anywhere near that truck again,

513
00:43:14,346 --> 00:43:16,431
Psycho will hang him by the
neck from the nearest tree

514
00:43:16,765 --> 00:43:18,725
with one of his own snakes.

515
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:21,394
Okay, but be careful.

516
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:25,982
I got enough trouble as it
is with these ecology nuts.

517
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:27,943
They claim I'm upsetting
the balance of nature

518
00:43:28,276 --> 00:43:31,613
by killing off all the
animals in the Everglades.

519
00:43:31,947 --> 00:43:33,490
The SPCA says it's cruel the way we

520
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:35,867
knock the lousy little animals off.

521
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:37,744
All I need next is that, what is it,

522
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:41,081
ACLU down on me for badgering Indians.

523
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:45,377
Badger? We don't badger 'em.

524
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,636
We'll kill 'em.

525
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,132
Just don't tell me if you do.

526
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:53,185
Especially me.

527
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:08,942
You know what this is?

528
00:44:10,277 --> 00:44:12,237
It's my new line of snakeskin belts.

529
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:20,036
A stinking, lousy little
snake with nothing,

530
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:22,914
until I make a belt out of him. Me.

531
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,132
I should be praised, not condemned,

532
00:44:34,676 --> 00:44:38,013
for making worthless animals
into something worthwhile.

533
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:39,939
Now, go get me my snakes.

534
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:42,642
But don't sell that Indian short.

535
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,313
You may have bitten off
more than you can chew

536
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,325
with him and those snakes.

537
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:53,912
I can't do it.

538
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:56,406
New act, or no new act, I can't do it.

539
00:44:57,407 --> 00:45:00,869
Honey, all it takes
is getting used to it.

540
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,755
Mind over matter.

541
00:45:04,998 --> 00:45:06,257
Disassociate.

542
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,218
Think of the money.

543
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:11,004
All those suckers buying
watered down drinks

544
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:12,923
at two bucks a throw.

545
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:16,009
And who have they come
to see? You, Gloria.

546
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,686
What about Timmy?

547
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:21,431
When he finds out what we're
gonna do to his snakes...

548
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:24,226
Will you forget that dumb Indian?

549
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,353
He's not dumb.

550
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:28,196
He's a nice young man.

551
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,358
Who loves snakes.

552
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:34,819
Honey, listen to me, for crying out loud.

553
00:45:35,153 --> 00:45:36,780
Will you wait a minute?

554
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:40,450
I don't blame you for not
wanting to do that with snakes,

555
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:45,038
but the lowest thing on
this earth is a snake,

556
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:47,874
but people are fascinated

557
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:50,418
and repulsed by them at the same time.

558
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:54,339
It's like a gory accident on the road.

559
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:56,933
It makes you sick to look,

560
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:59,719
but you can't take your eyes off it.

561
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:01,680
It's not right, it's immoral.

562
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:04,399
The back taxes we owe on this club

563
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,185
and the bills we can't pay
aren't right or moral either.

564
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,147
Look at the publicity
I've already gotten you.

565
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:12,991
The papers are eating it up.

566
00:46:15,944 --> 00:46:17,487
Think of your pretty costume.

567
00:46:19,572 --> 00:46:24,077
Cleopatra and her dance
of the headless asp.

568
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:25,837
What an act.

569
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:28,081
It'll be the biggest thing
since the boa constrictor

570
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:31,293
swallowing the chicken bit
came about in carnivals.

571
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:32,928
Think of our life savings.

572
00:46:33,128 --> 00:46:35,338
Okay, okay.

573
00:46:35,672 --> 00:46:36,806
I'll try it again.

574
00:46:38,758 --> 00:46:39,976
Someday, I'm gonna make enough money

575
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,929
so I will never have to do
anything I don't wanna do again.

576
00:46:44,222 --> 00:46:47,809
That's my little show business trooper.

577
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,903
Go, baby!

578
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:52,905
Do your stuff.

579
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,415
I got a surprise for you.

580
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:13,293
It's a little something I made myself.

581
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:17,889
Figured with the family and all

582
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:21,468
you'd want your own beds.

583
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:26,014
Well, how do you like it?

584
00:47:26,348 --> 00:47:28,016
All right Hazel, we'll try you first.

585
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,442
Come on.

586
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:32,070
There we go.

587
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:34,564
Hey, what are you doing? Come on, Stanley.

588
00:47:34,898 --> 00:47:35,823
That's your half.

589
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,780
Can't you stand to be away from Stanley?

590
00:47:42,113 --> 00:47:43,873
Come here, sweetheart, there.

591
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:48,002
Are you comfortable?

592
00:47:50,997 --> 00:47:54,834
I want you all to take a nap
and I'll fix some breakfast.

593
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:23,038
Now this is it, guys.

594
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:25,115
Swamp buggy won't go much further here.

595
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,583
Come on, let's get that boat off.

596
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:38,586
Come on, Bob.

597
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,388
Hey, man, I never knew it was due

598
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:42,507
five o'clock until this morning.

599
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:44,600
5:00 p.m. I dig, but...

600
00:48:46,094 --> 00:48:47,971
What kind of junk you on now, Psycho?

601
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:53,393
Screw this 5:00 a.m.
getting up jive, so wait.

602
00:48:58,106 --> 00:49:02,152
Somebody put cocaine, man, in my sniffer.

603
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:04,037
He ain't gonna be no help.

604
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:06,531
How's he gonna guard the truck
and help us get that Indian?

605
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:11,919
Clean up my nose, but...

606
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:17,133
what it did in my head.

607
00:49:22,547 --> 00:49:24,299
Hey, man, at range like this

608
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:26,759
I could almost cut you
in half, you know that?

609
00:49:27,886 --> 00:49:30,638
Hey, easy, Psycho. Easy, man.

610
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:33,141
And finish cutting
you in half with this.

611
00:49:33,475 --> 00:49:35,935
We brought you out here
to capture snakes, remember?

612
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:38,646
And help us kill an Indian
if he gave us any trouble.

613
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:42,275
That's what you're
getting double time for.

614
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:44,611
Not to kill us, understand?

615
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,121
Yeah.

616
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:47,539
Yeah.

617
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:48,415
Cool, man.

618
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:50,374
All right, now give me the bags.

619
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,713
Now give me the rifle, too.

620
00:50:05,256 --> 00:50:07,008
All right, now, just sit
chilly for a while, all right?

621
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:11,304
We'll be back in a couple
hours with the snakes.

622
00:50:11,638 --> 00:50:12,897
Get over here.

623
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:21,481
All right, bring it, that's it.

624
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:23,074
Grab it there.

625
00:50:31,908 --> 00:50:33,292
Relax, Psycho.

626
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:06,200
Hey.

627
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,903
We made a big mistake.

628
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:12,031
That pill-popping nut's as
liable to kill us as the Injun.

629
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:14,167
Don't worry, man.

630
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:15,794
I can handle him.

631
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:17,662
Famous last words.

632
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:18,838
Look at him.

633
00:51:19,038 --> 00:51:21,708
He's been to the moon long
before the astronauts ever were.

634
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,794
Hey, Psycho, eat a
sandwich or something, huh?

635
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:26,879
Stay off the pills and that sniffer.

636
00:51:29,674 --> 00:51:31,267
Yeah, mother.

637
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:35,354
Yeah, mother.

638
00:52:05,126 --> 00:52:07,128
Hey, I can use this about now.

639
00:52:07,462 --> 00:52:09,180
Easy, baby, easy.

640
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:13,259
Hey, how's Hazel and the kids, huh?

641
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,285
I guess some of our friends

642
00:52:30,485 --> 00:52:32,737
didn't hide as well as they should have.

643
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:35,031
Let's go get us some hunters, huh?

644
00:53:11,442 --> 00:53:13,027
Yeah, you got him.

645
00:53:37,218 --> 00:53:40,012
Look at that shot,
right in the head, man.

646
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:43,015
Ain't much, man, but six
hours in these glades,

647
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:44,859
I was thinking all these snakes had gone.

648
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,110
Let's go, baby.

649
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,979
Get more snakes than that.

650
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:03,327
You know what to do, Stanley.

651
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:16,724
Look at that.

652
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,135
Way over there, yeah, yeah.

653
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:22,305
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

654
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:23,773
Let's take him alive.

655
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:26,851
This skin's more usable that way.

656
00:54:27,185 --> 00:54:29,479
And you can use that
gun, man, if you have to.

657
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:31,406
I ain't going back with him.

658
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:32,240
Come on, man.

659
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,365
We gotta get him.

660
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:49,340
Up ahead.

661
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:58,466
There he is, Crail, get him.

662
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:08,192
There here is, over there, man.

663
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,819
Behind the tree.

664
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,285
Come on, Bob, this way.

665
00:55:33,668 --> 00:55:36,087
There he is, Crail, get him.

666
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:47,807
You damn fool!

667
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,983
You were so anxious to get that snake,

668
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,018
you ran us right into the quicksand.

669
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:53,896
Do something, Crail!

670
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:04,707
I warned you.

671
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:07,877
You didn't listen.

672
00:56:08,077 --> 00:56:09,628
God, man, help us.

673
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:27,688
Stanley,

674
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:32,109
bite his hand.

675
00:56:34,854 --> 00:56:36,898
What do you want me to do?

676
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,734
Do you want me to say I
lied about your father?

677
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:40,993
I lied!

678
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:44,997
Please?

679
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,375
Tim!

680
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:48,500
Ochopee!

681
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,838
Mister Ochopee?

682
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,216
Please...

683
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:23,911
Crail?

684
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,655
Crail, don't leave me.

685
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:28,249
Crail!

686
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,032
Yeah, mother.

687
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:20,376
Not yet, Stanley.

688
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,671
Well, you have lot to be thankful for.

689
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,132
And I think a prayer of
gratitude is in order.

690
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,270
All right.

691
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:35,733
Dear heavenly father,

692
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:39,028
grant us protection.

693
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:42,148
Give us strength to fight our enemies.

694
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:45,985
Accept our thanks for this food

695
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,071
and the shelter for thy
creations, the snakes.

696
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:51,665
Amen.

697
00:58:57,163 --> 00:58:58,213
Okay.

698
00:59:15,056 --> 00:59:16,974
You know, we're running outta mice, too.

699
00:59:18,142 --> 00:59:19,685
Maybe we get some before sundown,

700
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:21,729
and maybe we get Hazel a little bunny.

701
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,864
It was a shame that..

702
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,663
I wish you could be vegetarians like me.

703
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,544
Being animals, you should understand.

704
00:59:47,755 --> 00:59:49,298
You shouldn't eat other animals.

705
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:57,689
Man is an animal.

706
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:00,692
Doesn't stop him.

707
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:06,073
And why should I stop you?

708
01:00:08,526 --> 01:00:09,576
Stanley,

709
01:00:11,946 --> 01:00:12,996
you and Hazel

710
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:17,785
are the only true friends I have.

711
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:13,654
Hazel...

712
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:18,284
Hazel?

713
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:20,319
Bastard, you killed Hazel.

714
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:40,464
You killed Hazel, you son of a bitch.

715
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:08,742
You killed Hazel,

716
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,168
you bastard.

717
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,252
No.

718
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,341
Why?

719
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:26,680
Poor Hazel.

720
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:31,218
She never hurt anyone.

721
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,587
Busiest I've ever seen this place.

722
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:31,453
Hi, Timmy.

723
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:35,707
Man, what's wrong?

724
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:39,502
Hazel's dead.

725
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:45,334
And her three children.

726
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:46,885
Wow.

727
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:48,136
What happened?

728
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,349
Shot her.

729
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:56,770
Kicked the kids to death.

730
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,223
Have the police caught
the murderers yet?

731
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:02,984
Stanley killed him.

732
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:09,532
Stanley knew Hazel?

733
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:12,160
Married.

734
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:20,327
Married? How old were the kids?

735
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:21,711
About a week.

736
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,881
Six ounces.

737
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,834
A week old, six ounces.

738
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:30,470
What kind of kids were they?

739
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,223
Baby rattlers.

740
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:35,934
Baby what?

741
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:38,228
Rattlesnakes.

742
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:41,848
Rattlesnakes?

743
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,684
You mean Stanley and Hazel

744
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,978
and their children are rattlesnakes?

745
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,732
Is that what we've been talking about?

746
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:52,326
Rattlesnakes?

747
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:53,451
Yeah.

748
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:56,822
Hey, man, it's all right to play a joke,

749
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:59,074
but this is ridiculous.

750
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:00,333
Rattlesnakes?

751
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:05,914
You're trying to make a fool outta me.

752
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,009
Rattlesnakes.

753
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:51,126
Can't believe she's gonna
break the head off that snake.

754
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:57,799
I wonder if she'll really do it?

755
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:33,778
Stanley.

756
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:40,785
Stanley, why?

757
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:43,830
Why?

758
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:47,292
Why?

759
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:48,418
Why?

760
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:52,463
Why?

761
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,242
Okay, baby.

762
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:34,164
All the lights are turned out
and everything's locked up.

763
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:36,458
Jeez, Sidney, what a mess.

764
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:37,884
So what?

765
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:40,095
They say whining and dining the critics

766
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:42,255
was never a waste of time.

767
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:44,257
Ah, boy,

768
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:46,384
they loved the act.

769
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:48,144
You'll be a sensation.

770
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,397
We'll make money out of this club

771
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:52,190
the likes we never dreamed of.

772
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:55,527
Gloria?

773
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,854
I believe you had enough.

774
01:13:58,188 --> 01:13:59,531
Oh, yeah.

775
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:00,907
You think I had too much to drink, huh?

776
01:14:01,107 --> 01:14:03,026
Cut out the booze,
you're gaining weight.

777
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:05,570
Well, maybe you're right,

778
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:07,497
but I gotta have something to get

779
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:10,075
the taste of that snake outta my mouth.

780
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:16,498
You realize, with seven shows a week,

781
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:19,250
an extra show on Friday and Saturday,

782
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:25,590
I'm gonna be biting the
heads off nine snakes a week?

783
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:27,684
Wow.

784
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:32,138
Soon or later, Timmy Ochopee's
gonna hear about the new act,

785
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,809
and I sure don't wanna
see his face when he does.

786
01:14:48,863 --> 01:14:50,415
Hey.

787
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:52,909
Why buck that long drive home across town?

788
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:57,622
We'll get more sleep if we spend
the night here at the club.

789
01:14:57,956 --> 01:14:59,508
I'll tell you what.

790
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:03,628
Listen, I'll fix the couch,
and you dump your clothes.

791
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:04,596
I'm gonna fix the couch.

792
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:05,430
Now, dump your clothes.

793
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:08,008
We're spending the night
here at the club, now go.

794
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:10,677
There's something
spooky about this old club

795
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:14,180
late at night, with everybody gone.

796
01:15:14,514 --> 01:15:15,148
What's the matter?

797
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:16,274
You afraid your Indian friend's

798
01:15:16,474 --> 01:15:19,561
gonna sneak in and scalp you?

799
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:21,612
That's not funny, Sidney.

800
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,193
I used to take life as
seriously as old Timmy.

801
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:32,032
Old age kind of knocks the
meaning out of it all, though.

802
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:35,785
Forever gets shorter and shorter

803
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:39,706
as you grow older and older.

804
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,257
Like hell.

805
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,634
Kid's a weirdo.

806
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,172
There's no telling what
he's up to right now.

807
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,781
Still in pretty good shape.

808
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,209
What's that?

809
01:16:58,409 --> 01:16:59,335
Who?

810
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,129
Who's there?

811
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:03,048
Sidney.

812
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:04,841
Hey.

813
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:05,967
Hey, kid.

814
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,885
A little kindness too
much to ask from people?

815
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,021
Hmm?

816
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:20,899
Hey, kid.

817
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,525
I guess it is.

818
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,486
Timmy.

819
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:31,442
You like to bite the
heads off of snakes, Gloria?

820
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:34,404
I didn't want to do it.

821
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,460
Try this.

822
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,003
He made me do it.

823
01:20:02,468 --> 01:20:04,887
Hey, Grey, what's the matter?

824
01:20:05,888 --> 01:20:07,648
What's the matter with my baby?

825
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:09,934
What are you nervous about, huh?

826
01:20:11,269 --> 01:20:13,521
What's in th -- here you go.

827
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:14,906
Yes.

828
01:20:15,106 --> 01:20:17,734
Yes, that's all right.

829
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:18,993
There's nothing.

830
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:22,155
That's a good boy, yes, it's okay.

831
01:21:25,009 --> 01:21:27,678
Water moccasins in your swimming pool.

832
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,899
If they're good enough
to hold your pants up,

833
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:33,643
they're good enough to swim with.

834
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:37,855
That way, Stanley, I haven't got all day.

835
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:43,444
You want to kill people
that want to destroy you?

836
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:54,310
Dad.

837
01:24:56,554 --> 01:24:57,605
Dad?

838
01:25:52,485 --> 01:25:54,236
Who are you?

839
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:56,664
What do you want?

840
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,034
Did you ever hear
of the garden of Eden?

841
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:02,411
I need an Eve in my garden.

It's taken us hours to get here

866
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:35,207
and we never saw another
person the whole trip.

867
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,588
How far is your nearest
neighbor from here?

868
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:43,340
I don't have any neighbors.

869
01:29:43,674 --> 01:29:45,676
And that's the way I want to keep it.

870
01:29:59,106 --> 01:30:00,157
What's that?

871
01:30:02,776 --> 01:30:04,244
That's Hazel.

872
01:30:05,571 --> 01:30:08,157
She was killed by your
father's hunters, too.

873
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:09,499
A snake?

874
01:30:12,036 --> 01:30:15,080
You really wigged out on this
nature stuff, didn't you?

875
01:30:15,414 --> 01:30:16,340
Stanley?

876
01:30:17,499 --> 01:30:18,759
Stanley.

877
01:30:30,387 --> 01:30:33,140
I want you to meet Susie, Stanley.

878
01:30:36,977 --> 01:30:38,028
Touch him.

879
01:30:39,355 --> 01:30:40,856
Come on, touch him.

880
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:45,327
He's not slimy, is he?

881
01:30:47,613 --> 01:30:50,616
Dry and warm, like the touch of magic.

882
01:30:53,035 --> 01:30:54,336
Now hold him.

883
01:30:55,579 --> 01:30:57,289
Come on, hold him.

884
01:30:57,623 --> 01:30:59,208
Will he bite?

885
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,176
Just his enemies.

886
01:31:02,336 --> 01:31:03,387
He's mine.

887
01:31:08,676 --> 01:31:10,260
He likes you, Susie.

888
01:31:14,264 --> 01:31:18,978
It's the first time I've ever
been liked by a rattlesnake.

889
01:31:31,156 --> 01:31:32,582
I like you, Susie.

890
01:31:34,284 --> 01:31:35,335
Like...

891
01:31:37,538 --> 01:31:39,089
isn't a strong enough word.

892
01:31:40,374 --> 01:31:42,134
If you wanna go to bed with me,

893
01:31:43,293 --> 01:31:45,045
you have to use the word love.

894
01:32:02,521 --> 01:32:04,565
I'm gonna rape you.

895
01:32:04,898 --> 01:32:07,192
Go to bed with you, love you.

896
01:32:08,736 --> 01:32:11,155
Is that all you ever think about it?

897
01:32:11,488 --> 01:32:12,456
Hmm?

898
01:32:12,656 --> 01:32:14,166
What else is there?

899
01:32:18,537 --> 01:32:22,041
I think life's good
enough for everybody.

900
01:32:51,445 --> 01:32:52,913
Tim?

901
01:32:53,113 --> 01:32:54,498
Tim, wake up.

902
01:32:57,701 --> 01:32:58,752
Wake up.

903
01:33:02,706 --> 01:33:04,216
We fell asleep.

904
01:33:06,376 --> 01:33:07,878
It's dark outside.

905
01:33:10,506 --> 01:33:11,556
What time is it?

906
01:33:12,883 --> 01:33:14,184
It's night time.

907
01:33:14,384 --> 01:33:15,560
Got anything to eat?

908
01:33:17,471 --> 01:33:19,014
Got something in the cabinet.

909
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,650
Beautiful.

910
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,936
Can I take some of this
food with me tomorrow?

911
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:27,906
Tomorrow? What do you mean?

912
01:33:28,774 --> 01:33:30,117
I'm gonna hit the road,

913
01:33:30,317 --> 01:33:32,778
thumb my way out west to Taos, New Mexico,

914
01:33:33,112 --> 01:33:35,364
and join a groovy commune
out there I read about.

915
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,076
You're gonna try to leave here?

916
01:33:41,912 --> 01:33:43,831
You must be outta your mind.

917
01:33:44,164 --> 01:33:45,666
Me, out of my mind?

918
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:48,677
You've gotta be kidding.

919
01:33:49,878 --> 01:33:51,505
Me, out of my mind.

920
01:33:55,634 --> 01:33:57,970
Well, what do you mean by that?

921
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,683
You live out here with a bunch snakes.

922
01:34:03,016 --> 01:34:05,227
You name them, have a cemetery for them.

923
01:34:06,395 --> 01:34:07,654
They're my friends.

924
01:34:08,313 --> 01:34:09,490
That's weird.

925
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:10,616
It was like the sergeant

926
01:34:10,816 --> 01:34:12,442
you were telling me about in Vietnam.

927
01:34:14,111 --> 01:34:16,071
You doing all the killing,
the dirty work for him,

928
01:34:16,405 --> 01:34:18,574
while he played God over right and wrong.

929
01:34:20,367 --> 01:34:22,619
You're doing the same thing here.

930
01:34:24,288 --> 01:34:27,040
These snakes are just your
slaves while you play God,

931
01:34:27,374 --> 01:34:29,050
deciding who's bad and good.

932
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:33,714
You couldn't even kill my father yourself.

933
01:34:35,674 --> 01:34:37,226
You had to get a bunch of snakes

934
01:34:37,426 --> 01:34:39,219
to get your revenge for you.

935
01:34:43,098 --> 01:34:44,816
Not revenge. Justice.

936
01:34:50,189 --> 01:34:51,490
I'm thirsty.

937
01:34:54,526 --> 01:34:55,577
Susie?

938
01:34:57,571 --> 01:34:59,206
I...

939
01:35:00,282 --> 01:35:02,451
I can't help the way I am.

940
01:35:06,413 --> 01:35:07,714
If you don't...

941
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:13,629
I get these tremendous headaches.

942
01:35:13,962 --> 01:35:15,923
They're worse than headaches.

943
01:35:19,676 --> 01:35:21,228
The mind, like my whole head,

944
01:35:21,428 --> 01:35:23,222
just seems to swell up in pain.

945
01:35:24,806 --> 01:35:26,483
Try a shrink.

946
01:35:31,813 --> 01:35:33,073
Susie, please,

947
01:35:35,234 --> 01:35:36,493
don't leave me.

948
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:44,835
We'll raise our...

949
01:35:45,035 --> 01:35:48,080
we'll raise our children to
hate people and love snakes.

950
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:53,835
Please, please stay
with me, Susie. Please.

951
01:35:59,049 --> 01:36:02,052
You're freakier than my father was.

952
01:36:05,514 --> 01:36:07,057
You'll never leave here, Susie.

953
01:36:08,684 --> 01:36:09,734
Not ever.

954
01:36:10,894 --> 01:36:14,439
I wanna show you the
real beauty in this life.

955
01:36:23,115 --> 01:36:26,576
You're too full of
self-righteous hate and self pity

956
01:36:27,619 --> 01:36:29,788
to be able to see any beauty in anything.

957
01:36:31,707 --> 01:36:33,425
I'm just a trophy,

958
01:36:35,335 --> 01:36:37,629
like an animal you capture
and bring back alive.

959
01:36:40,257 --> 01:36:42,926
You'd just like to have me
around for your convenience.

960
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,804
Locked up in a cage like
you keep those snakes.

961
01:36:49,975 --> 01:36:54,896
Cut it out.

962
01:36:56,315 --> 01:36:57,074
What's wrong, Susie?

963
01:36:57,274 --> 01:36:58,158
Is it locked?

964
01:36:59,526 --> 01:37:01,161
Well, I'll open it for you.

965
01:37:04,072 --> 01:37:05,866
There's nothing but swamp out there.

966
01:37:08,493 --> 01:37:10,329
If it was daylight, maybe you'd be lucky,

967
01:37:12,581 --> 01:37:14,666
but you'd never find
your way out at night.

968
01:37:29,431 --> 01:37:32,517
I'm sorry I said those
bad things about you, Tim.

969
01:37:32,851 --> 01:37:34,361
Yeah, I am, too.

970
01:37:50,911 --> 01:37:52,579
What are you doing?

971
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,540
I'm just getting some of my slaves

972
01:37:55,874 --> 01:37:57,501
to do some more dirty work for me.

973
01:37:59,252 --> 01:38:00,754
Isn't that the way you said it?

974
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:05,016
Tim?

975
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:09,513
I was only kidding about Taos.

976
01:38:12,557 --> 01:38:14,309
I do wanna stay here with you.

977
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:21,533
Let me out!

978
01:38:21,733 --> 01:38:23,410
Please, let me out!

979
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:25,612
Please, I want out!

980
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:29,249
Please.

981
01:38:31,618 --> 01:38:33,370
Let me out of here.

982
01:38:34,538 --> 01:38:37,124
Let me out, please, I want out!

983
01:38:37,457 --> 01:38:38,383
Please.

984
01:38:44,047 --> 01:38:45,181
Let me out!

985
01:38:46,591 --> 01:38:47,642
Stop it.

986
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:02,031
Little Susie.

987
01:39:03,316 --> 01:39:04,784
Come on, Susie.

988
01:39:06,903 --> 01:39:08,572
I think the worst,

989
01:39:08,905 --> 01:39:10,740
the worst pain in this Earth,

990
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,911
is what people inflict on
other people. Mentally.

991
01:39:19,207 --> 01:39:20,258
Susie,

992
01:39:22,043 --> 01:39:25,213
I've never felt like an Indian,

993
01:39:25,547 --> 01:39:28,800
or like a white man,

994
01:39:29,134 --> 01:39:30,602
or like a human.

995
01:39:32,512 --> 01:39:33,646
I dream.

996
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:36,600
I dream about...

997
01:39:38,518 --> 01:39:39,569
crawling

998
01:39:40,353 --> 01:39:42,113
through the swamps.

999
01:39:45,442 --> 01:39:46,451
I dream...

1000
01:39:48,153 --> 01:39:49,204
about...

1001
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:52,081
being...

1002
01:39:53,992 --> 01:39:55,084
the biggest...

1003
01:39:56,661 --> 01:39:57,712
snake...

1004
01:39:59,498 --> 01:40:01,049
in the world.

1005
01:40:32,572 --> 01:40:34,332
Pretty little Susie.

1006
01:40:35,992 --> 01:40:39,579
If I were a human, I'd
be crazy, but I'm not.

1007
01:40:42,415 --> 01:40:44,417
Stanley, think about it.

1008
01:40:44,751 --> 01:40:45,385
No.

1009
01:40:45,585 --> 01:40:46,636
Bite her.

1010
01:40:46,836 --> 01:40:47,762
Bite her.

1011
01:40:49,172 --> 01:40:50,715
Come on and kill her.

1012
01:40:51,049 --> 01:40:53,677
I said kill her Stanley, kill her.

1013
01:40:55,345 --> 01:40:58,306
If you don't, I'll get somebody else.

1014
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,358
No.

1015
01:40:59,558 --> 01:41:01,317
Can't you help me?

1016
01:41:02,811 --> 01:41:03,862
Please!

1017
01:41:16,658 --> 01:41:19,536
Now, you get over there and kill her.

1018
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:26,376
Get on over there.

1019
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:27,844
Come on.

1020
01:41:28,044 --> 01:41:28,970
Kill her.

1021
01:41:53,111 --> 01:41:54,245
I told you.

1022
01:41:56,072 --> 01:41:57,206
I told you.

1023
01:42:02,245 --> 01:42:03,004
Now kill her.

1024
01:42:03,204 --> 01:42:04,506
No!

1025
01:42:04,706 --> 01:42:06,215
Kill her.

1026
01:42:07,042 --> 01:42:08,092
Kill her.

1027
01:42:08,752 --> 01:42:09,802
Kill her.

1028
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,001
I'm sorry, Stanley.

1029
01:42:54,214 --> 01:42:55,264
I'm sorry.

1030
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:46,936
Maybe in hell,

1031
01:45:48,429 --> 01:45:50,223
I'll find out what I am.

1032
01:45:52,475 --> 01:45:53,526
