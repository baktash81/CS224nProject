1
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:55,052
Ab ovo...

2
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:57,615
In toto...

3
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:00,544
Nil desperandum...

4
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:03,320
Sine die...

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,049
Vampires!

6
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:20,528
Hyah!

7
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,637
Be careful!
Watch out!

8
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,558
Vampires!

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,441
Yaah!
Give me that stone!

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,313
Keep hold of it!
Don't let it go!

11
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:48,058
No...

12
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,547
Yaah...

13
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,047
Aah!

14
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:29,440
Hon?

15
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:31,168
What?

16
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,480
Oh-hh...

17
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:38,754
You have another nightmare?

18
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,289
The vampires were back.

19
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:42,210
Oh, this is ridiculous.

20
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:46,050
I've got to get some sleep.

21
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,196
Mom...

22
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:54,851
Do you like this place?

23
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:57,891
Well, it's a big change for you,
I know.

24
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,324
New house...

25
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,085
New country...

26
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:04,933
Hear that?

27
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,236
It's the wind.

28
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,093
Or the undead.

29
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,159
Mom?

30
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:18,470
Dad?

31
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,103
Tony,

32
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,607
If I don't get some sleep,

33
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,815
Then I'll be one of the undead.

34
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:27,208
Come on, Honey,
you're gonna be late.

35
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,865
Got everything?

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,304
Jump in.

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,777
Put your seatbelt on.

38
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,689
Hey...

39
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,738
Wave hi to Dad and Lord McAshton.

40
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,268
Scotland is beautiful, isn't it?

41
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:59,213
If you don't have vampires.

42
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,069
And you know we really don't,

43
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:03,630
Right? But a dream isn't real.

44
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:05,390
I know what a dream is, Mom.

45
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:06,669
Okay.
I'm just asking.

46
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,302
But you know

47
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,190
There is no such thing as
vampires, right?

48
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:12,142
Mom!
You're on the wrong side of the road!

49
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,519
Whoa!

50
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,671
What did he say?

51
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,296
Everybody talks weird here.

52
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,088
Don't worry,
things are gonna get better.

53
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,553
You'll meet some new friends
here soon.

54
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,633
Fight! Fight! Fight!

55
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,137
This is for being a little creep!

56
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,289
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

57
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:32,178
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

58
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,553
Fight! Fight!

59
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,370
And this is for coming here

60
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,386
In the first place!

61
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:43,572
On Saturday night,

62
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,075
We'll be able to see

63
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,868
Comet Forsey

64
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,596
in conjunction

65
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,772
with the moon

66
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,173
for the first time in 300 years.

67
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,676
And then..

68
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,333
And then the beam of light
comes from the moon.

69
00:04:58,677 --> 00:04:59,541
As usual, our American friend

70
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,078
is full of stories.

71
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,102
What makes you say that?

72
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,478
I dreamt it.

73
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:04,854
Stupid Yank.

74
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,974
Fine.

75
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,030
Now you've had your joke.

76
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,631
No.

77
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,583
I've dreamt it every night
since I've been here.

78
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,856
And then there's a gathering.

79
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,008
A gathering of what?

80
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,895
A gathering of vampires.

81
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,624
Not again, Tony.

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
I really saw it!

83
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,105
The comet, the beam of light,

84
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,409
The vampires, and the vampire hunter.

85
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,066
All right, that's it.

86
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:30,201
You've earned yourself a
chair in the hall.

87
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,858
Fly away back to California, Creep.

88
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:52,702
Look what I got you.

89
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:54,046
A golf club!

90
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:55,198
Yeah.

91
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,886
A junior set of golf clubs.

92
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,038
You know, the game was invented

93
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,383
In Scotland.

94
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,367
But there's no one to play with.

95
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,447
Well, that's the beauty of golf.

96
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,791
You don't need anyone to play with.

97
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,488
But I want someone to play with.

98
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,087
Then I'll teach you.

99
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,104
You never have time.

100
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,543
Now, look, Tony, I'm trying here.

101
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,464
There you are.

102
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,889
The babysitter's downstairs.

103
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,009
Good.

104
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,097
When are you gonna be back?

105
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,761
Not too late, Hon.

106
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,746
It's business.
Lord McAshton invited us.

107
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,121
All the investors are gonna
be there.

108
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,330
Hey, look at those.

109
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,642
Those are great!

110
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,467
I didn't know you could draw
so good.

111
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:35,107
Right.

112
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:36,643
Great.
You know...

113
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,083
If you want to do something
really cool,

114
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,292
Draw me a picture of Tiger Woods.

115
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:46,533
Good night, Hon.

116
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:48,453
I want you in bed by 9:00,

117
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,790
And don't give yourself any nightmares.

118
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,806
Mwah!
I love you.

119
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:59,047
Be a good boy.

120
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,125
Lord McAshton.

121
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,565
Bob.
And Dodie.

122
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:41,621
Dottie.

123
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:42,806
Of course it is.

124
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,310
What do you think of our blimp?

125
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,654
Oh, I like the blimp..
Me too.

126
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,382
How nice to see you.

127
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,599
He likes my blimp.

128
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,643
Okay, Pet, it's time to.. Oh!

129
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,059
Oh! Tony!

130
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:18,139
What a fright you gave me!

131
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,995
I didnea see you sitting there, Pet.

132
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,595
Och, Dear,
you near stopped my heart,

133
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,611
and it's near enough stopping
as it is.

134
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,756
That's the truth of it,
and you wouldn't want to do that

135
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:27,388
to Miss Lorna now, would you?

136
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,468
Eh? Listen, you can have a
wee read of your book

137
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,837
once you're settled,
but mean while brush your teeth

138
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,149
and away to bed.

139
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,470
Bed for the undead?

140
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,689
Ahh... Ha ha ha!

141
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:02,626
Got you now, you filthy thing!

142
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,961
Let the chase begin.

143
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,419
Right.

144
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,881
Ab ovo...

145
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,915
In toto...

146
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,090
What clan...

147
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,851
Are you from, Brother?

148
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,435
Have the lights gone?

149
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,315
Who are you?

150
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,540
You are not a brother.

151
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:16,885
Well, I'm not a sister.

152
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:19,445
You're human.

153
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,493
You're full of blood!

154
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,190
Gonna keep it that way, Dude!

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,824
I'm too weak...

156
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,584
I'm not afraid...

157
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,505
I'm not afraid...

158
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:45,754
Do you need help?

159
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,618
What twisted kind of mortal
are you?

160
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:56,411
I know you.

161
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,171
I saw you in my dream.

162
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,475
Must've been a nightmare.

163
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,043
It was.

164
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,284
I must leave.

165
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,172
But you can't even walk.

166
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,837
Who needs to walk...

167
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,717
When I can fly?

168
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,333
Whoa... Aah!

169
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,729
You okay?

170
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,266
Do I look it?

171
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:50,915
Rookery.

172
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,060
Do you...

173
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:02,532
Do you know

174
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:04,485
Where I can get a cow?

175
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,174
If you want a glass of milk...

176
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,286
No, not milk.

177
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,494
A cow.

178
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,350
Hurry.

179
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,248
Your eyes are getting heavy...

180
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,470
You're falling into a deep sleep...

181
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,057
Ugh...

182
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,785
I think I'm gonna hurl.

183
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:12,024
Aww...

184
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,447
It's just a little one.

185
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:17,654
Well, let's see how you like

186
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,286
This!

187
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,130
So...

188
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,795
That's not enough for you, eh?

189
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:44,651
Let's see you escape

190
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,059
From me now!

191
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,042
Aah!

192
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,481
Shut your eyes, Tony!

193
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,279
That was very clever.

194
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,294
But I'll

195
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,862
Catch you!

196
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,764
You can open your eyes now.

197
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:05,891
Wow!

198
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:08,098
Enjoying the view?

199
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:09,058
Yeah.

200
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:10,977
And thanks, Dude.

201
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,544
You saved my life.

202
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,103
That truck was gonna splatter me.

203
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,990
You keep calling me dude.

204
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:19,614
My name's Rudolph.

205
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,533
Dude is slang.

206
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,412
Like you call a friend.

207
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:25,786
A friend?

208
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:27,578
Well, we saved each other's lives,

209
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:28,697
Didn't we?

210
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,504
Yes, we did.
Friends.

211
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,200
My name is Tony.

212
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:37,846
Come on.
Let's play.

213
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:39,766
Yes.
We play.

214
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:42,644
Yeah!

215
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,202
My best friend's a vampire!

216
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:46,483
Yeah!

217
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,425
Yeah!

218
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:53,296
I haven't heard music like this

219
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:54,735
Since my brother's wedding.

220
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:00,141
You see, it has a proper rhythm.

221
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:01,837
That's what I like.

222
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,852
Ah, the Grandsons!

223
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,834
We came to say good night, Grandfather.

224
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,018
Now, Boys...

225
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:08,842
This is Tommy's mother and father.

226
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:10,728
That's Tony.

227
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:11,752
Tony.

228
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,287
Of course it is.
The boys tell me

229
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:15,206
That they have become great
friends with your son.

230
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:16,934
He's our favorite plaything.

231
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,213
Playmate.

232
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,133
There you have it.

233
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,316
Off to bed.

234
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,755
Well, lovely to meet you.

235
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,227
Tell tony we'll see him tomorrow.

236
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,347
Bright and early.

237
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:26,465
Ha! Will do.

238
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,065
They seem like terrific kids.

239
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,504
They are, they are.

240
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,328
If you'll excuse me,
I need another drink...

241
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:32,863
Of poison.

242
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,998
Cheers.

243
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:38,845
Cheers.

244
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:43,707
So...

245
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:46,234
How is my son fitting in? Okay?

246
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,258
He doesn't tell you?

247
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,505
Oh, he tells me plenty,

248
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,041
But, you know kids.

249
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,696
I'm talking about Tony's obsession

250
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,102
with vampires.

251
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,748
Excuse me.

252
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,290
I think I should get home.

253
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,721
Rudolph, how do we get down
from here?

254
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,088
We'll fly.

255
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:13,775
But I can't fly.

256
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,342
I got you up here, didn't I?

257
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,549
Well, I guess so.

258
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:19,021
Then stay calm...

259
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:20,908
Friend.

260
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:24,939
All right, let's fly.

261
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:28,969
As long as I'm holding onto you,

262
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,568
You're fine.

263
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:32,136
Trust me.

264
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:33,542
Ready?

265
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:34,919
Whoa, I'm flying!

266
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,821
Wow-ww...!

267
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,434
Wow! It's great to be a vampire!

268
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,513
Membership does have its privileges.

269
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:51,136
Look.

270
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,311
My mom and dad went to a
party there.

271
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:03,386
I'm terribly sorry.
Excuse me.

272
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:05,690
Oh, Mr. Thompson,
Awful sorry to bother you,

273
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,257
But I didnea know what else
to do!

274
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:08,761
What?

275
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,872
He's not here and I've looked everywhere

276
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,344
And... No,

277
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,846
No, I came up and he was..

278
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,190
Until up about half an hour ago.

279
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,270
I can't understand you.
Say it again.

280
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,125
In English.

281
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,468
Slowly.

282
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,228
Come back with Mrs. Thompson.

283
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:23,411
Help me find him!

284
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,011
Yeah!

285
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,215
Vampires are different than
I thought they'd be.

286
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,511
Father's seen to that.

287
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,982
We're a family, not fiends.

288
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:37,741
That's why we only try to
drink cow's blood.

289
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:38,956
But I thought vampires

290
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,715
drink human blood.

291
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:43,339
We do,
but we've got to make do with cows.

292
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:44,778
Why?

293
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:47,337
Because we've been hunted for centuries.

294
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,905
We always have to hide.

295
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,623
We want to become humans,
not eat them for dinner.

296
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,365
Can you see what color that
car is?

297
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,259
Green.

298
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,827
Man and woman inside,

299
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,491
man talking very loudly

300
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:04,642
and waving his hands.

301
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:05,665
Oh, no, my parents!

302
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,009
I'm in a lot of trouble.

303
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,321
My dad's gonna kill me!

304
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,413
He wasn't like this at home.

305
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,132
This is Scotland, not San Diego.

306
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,979
What do you expect?
He's an eight-year-old kid.

307
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:24,154
Oh, Mr. Thompson,
Mrs. Thompson!

308
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,817
I've been waiting on you
coming back!

309
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:28,377
Cannae understand.
Sent him away early,

310
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:29,816
like you said, to bed.

311
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:30,711
And then I was up checking
him and..

312
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,471
Tony?

313
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:33,431
I mean, just for half an hour

314
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,030
And I cannae underst..

315
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,292
I saw what I saw

316
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:39,796
and I saw what I didnae see.

317
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:42,035
And.. and I.. I didnae see..

318
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,042
What's that?

319
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,464
I smell it, too.

320
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:23,714
So...

321
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:25,409
Those are your parents?
They look nice.

322
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:26,945
And tasty?

323
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,928
No, nice.
As in very nice.

324
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:31,807
They have their moments.

325
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,470
I suppose I must take my leave.

326
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:39,707
I haven't had so much fun
with a boy my own age

327
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,403
since I really was nine.

328
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,490
Thanks...

329
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:43,578
Dude.

330
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,001
You can stay if you want.

331
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,023
Maybe I should.

332
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,102
Do vampires always sleep in coffins?

333
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:55,670
'cause that's gonna be a problem.

334
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,652
Just as long as the sun can't
find me.

335
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,317
This would be excellent.

336
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,338
I have to take out all this junk.

337
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:06,609
Junk? It's a treasure chest.

338
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:09,168
I've hidden in trees

339
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:10,991
and watched mortals play this game.

340
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,910
What is it?
Nintendo.

341
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:14,349
Duh-hh!

342
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:15,693
Nintendo duh...

343
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:17,773
Can I play with this Nintendo duh?

344
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,892
It's Nintendo.

345
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,396
Duh's just a word people say

346
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:22,731
when someone asks a dumb question.

347
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:26,121
Duh...

348
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:27,784
More like duh-hh!

349
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,128
Duh-hh!

350
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,327
Duh-hh!

351
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:33,766
Duh.

352
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:36,101
I'll teach you Nintendo tomorrow.

353
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,940
I know.
You must sleep now.

354
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:41,795
It's late for mortals.

355
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:52,542
Until the night.

356
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,653
Good night.

357
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,126
So you're like 1,000 years old

358
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:17,492
or something, right?

359
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:20,148
I've just been nine for over
300 years.

360
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:22,227
I wanna be a vampire, too.

361
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:24,242
No.

362
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:26,129
You don't know what that means.

363
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,136
Nah, doing the most awesome stuff

364
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:32,558
I've ever done in my life.

365
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:34,222
No blue skies, Tony.

366
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:35,853
No birds singing.

367
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,836
No flowers in the sunlight.

368
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:41,163
Just this constant night.

369
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,890
Cool!

370
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:48,904
Good morning!

371
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:53,318
Now, why are you sleeping this way?

372
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:55,557
Did you have another nightmare
last night?

373
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:56,805
Yeah.

374
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,436
Aww...
Poor baby.

375
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,763
No.

376
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:03,778
I dreamt I was... Flying.

377
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:04,642
You did?

378
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,209
That's wonderful!

379
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,872
That's a good kind of dream
to have.

380
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,631
Now, come on, get up.

381
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:11,871
Rise and shine!
Time to go to school!

382
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:26,617
Hiss-ss!
The sun!

383
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,503
Sorry, Dude.

384
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,039
Honey, you hungry?

385
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,054
I could eat a cow!

386
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:47,824
Nancy...

387
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:00,427
Good morning, Vampy.

388
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:03,018
You mean Wimpy, don't you? Ha!

389
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,513
Out of my way, Losers!

390
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,552
You dirty little..

391
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,413
Fight! Fight! Fight!

392
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:15,333
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

393
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,467
Fighting with the McAshton Boys,

394
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:19,523
of all people!

395
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,931
They started it.

396
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:22,755
Keep still.

397
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,577
It's still bleeding.

398
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:26,113
Let me get another tissue.

399
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,032
Now, last night your teacher
told me

400
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:30,239
that you'd been talking an
awful lot about monsters.

401
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:32,447
No wonder they keep teasing you.

402
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,270
Not monsters.
Vampires.

403
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,549
It's all the same.

404
00:25:35,645 --> 00:25:36,860
No, it's not.

405
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,931
You know, It's gonna be rough

406
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:41,530
making friends like that.

407
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:42,906
I have a friend.

408
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:44,761
You do?

409
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,552
What's his name?

410
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,024
Rudolph.

411
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,911
Where does he live?

412
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,286
Not far.

413
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:52,503
What's he like?

414
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,093
He's...

415
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,596
He's very, very cool.

416
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:57,939
Well, invite him for a sleepover.

417
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,243
I already did.

418
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,192
There it is again.

419
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,016
What?

420
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:09,903
That smell.

421
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:14,061
I don't smell anything.

422
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,545
Nice, easy stroke.

423
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:29,127
Okay, give it a shot.

424
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:37,252
All right!
Pretty good!

425
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:38,627
When does the sun go down?

426
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,963
Not for a while.

427
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,554
But I need to be home before
it sets.

428
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:47,039
What's the big hurry?
You bored already?

429
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,544
No.
I know

430
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,622
What you've been thinking
about me.

431
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,740
Tony, I'm sorry I've been
so rough on you lately,

432
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:57,724
I got the job on one hand
and this teacher..

433
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,771
I know.
Mom told me.

434
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:00,698
Yeah.

435
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:03,961
Dad, do you think I'm crazy?

436
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,489
Oh, no, Tony.

437
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,247
I just think that vampires

438
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:09,751
Belong in a movie somewhere,

439
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:11,191
Not in your room.

440
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:12,661
How did you know he's in my room?

441
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,157
I'm kidding.

442
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:18,579
Not very funny, right?

443
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:21,458
Kind of funny.

444
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:22,769
Let's play golf!

445
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:23,666
Okay, that's the spirit!

446
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:25,009
Let's set up again.

447
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,426
Rudolph!

448
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,196
Psst!

449
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,604
What?

450
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:21,306
Rudolph!

451
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,486
Can we go flying again?

452
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,531
No, it's too dangerous.

453
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:29,777
I only came because of this.

454
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,694
Hmpf! My drawing?
You can have it.

455
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:32,684
Where have you seen it?

456
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:34,187
Why do you wanna know?

457
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:36,008
It's very important.

458
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:39,587
I'll only tell you if you
take me flying again.

459
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:45,274
Yippee!

460
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:50,131
Whoa-aa...

461
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,617
We live down there.

462
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:59,557
Cemetery?
Cool!

463
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:01,474
I could get used to that.

464
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:03,998
So you didn't see the real
thing, then?

465
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:06,745
I dreamt it all.

466
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,375
The amulet...

467
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,068
The comet...

468
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,985
Does it mean something?

469
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:14,222
I can't say.
It's a secret.

470
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:17,609
Who am I gonna tell?

471
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:19,302
Who's gonna believe me?

472
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:22,595
All right.

473
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,118
It is the Comet Attamon.

474
00:29:25,214 --> 00:29:27,355
It's the Comet Of The Lost Souls.

475
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:28,952
It could mean the end of this curse.

476
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,445
What curse?

477
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,362
The curse of being a vampire.

478
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,982
It is a piece of the comet
that fell to earth.

479
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:39,465
A great magician made it
into an amulet of power,

480
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,692
and we lost it,
300 years ago to the sea.

481
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:44,961
Yes, yes, I saw it!

482
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,878
My Uncle Von
Tried to catch it...

483
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:50,680
and we've never seen him since.

484
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:52,278
From that night to this,

485
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,546
Our wandering has never ended.

486
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:56,272
I'll help you find it.

487
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,923
That must be what my dream
really means.

488
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,905
Yes, you're to join our quest.

489
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,789
We'll truly be brothers now.

490
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:11,736
Hide!
My parents are coming!

491
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:12,823
But we're brothers!

492
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,484
They don't know that!
Go!

493
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,106
Mama! Papa!

494
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:30,620
Rudolph!
Thank the stars you're safe!

495
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:32,505
My son,
you mustn't stray so far away.

496
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,847
We were afraid..

497
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,541
I was only taking the road
less traveled.

498
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,627
You got lost.

499
00:30:36,723 --> 00:30:38,576
My poor Rudolph!

500
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,206
Yoo-hoo!

501
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:43,241
Anna!
Brother, Darling.

502
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:44,551
You're the nervy one...

503
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,404
Sneaking off like some daywalker.

504
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,874
I wish.

505
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,344
So, Father, did you find the stone?

506
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,964
No, but I'm sure we're on the
right path.

507
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,562
We still have 48 hours.

508
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,520
Well, you see, that's..

509
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,534
I will not fail you!

510
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,003
Gregory!

511
00:31:02,348 --> 00:31:03,818
No, Gregory!
He's my friend!

512
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:05,320
A mortal!

513
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,995
I'm Rudolph's friend,

514
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:11,104
and he gave me a bite-proof guarantee.

515
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,458
You could be anything to my son.

516
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:16,599
Victimizer, slave...

517
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:17,941
Dinner, perhaps.

518
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:19,794
But you can never be his friend.

519
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,383
He likes vampires,
and he dreams about us.

520
00:31:22,478 --> 00:31:24,715
Am I in your dreams, Mortal?

521
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,408
And he knows about the amulet.

522
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,167
Ah...
Then he's a spy.

523
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,540
Rookery's Knave.

524
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:32,001
Darling, he doesn't look like
a spy.

525
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:34,397
And besides, even Rudolph

526
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,761
couldn't make up such a story.

527
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:39,637
Could you, Sweetheart?

528
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:43,087
Mortal or not, he's just a boy.

529
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:44,908
But if you insist on eating him,
go ahead..

530
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,017
I never said I would.

531
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,222
It's impossible.

532
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:51,331
Leave, I say.
But, Rudolph..

533
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:52,514
Should've never befriended you.

534
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,718
Leave, I say!

535
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:58,201
Aah!

536
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,636
Rookery!
Get back!

537
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:08,329
Get back!

538
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,375
Go!
Take the family!

539
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:12,548
Run!

540
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:15,838
Do as I say!

541
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,299
Stay away from my family!

542
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,929
Do your worst!

543
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,748
The age of chivalry is not
yet dead..

544
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,904
You!

545
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,647
What kind of bloodsucker are you?

546
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:03,192
Ow!

547
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,144
Tony, are you all right?

548
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,329
Look out!

549
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,749
Come on!

550
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:16,803
Aah!

551
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:18,943
Oh!

552
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,637
Wow.

553
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,417
Hey!

554
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:25,653
What's your problem?

555
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,794
None of your business, Pal.

556
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,127
It is when it's in my cemetery.

557
00:33:30,223 --> 00:33:33,259
Visiting hours are from dawn
till dusk.

558
00:33:33,354 --> 00:33:35,974
Now... Get a move on!

559
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:42,876
What you did was foolish!

560
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:45,144
Foolish...

561
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:46,519
But brave.

562
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:35,341
We shared a vision.

563
00:34:35,437 --> 00:34:37,641
He has a sympathy for our kind.

564
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:39,208
Oh, lovely.

565
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,700
Young Von found the stone...

566
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:43,617
Then made his way to Scotland...

567
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,406
Plucked from the sea by a
merchant ship

568
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,004
just as rumor had it.

569
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,953
Then he could still be roaming free.

570
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:51,317
There was a woman I'd never
seen before...

571
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:52,947
She wore a strange coat of arms.

572
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,439
We must find which family
she belongs to,

573
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:56,685
Trace her Crest.

574
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,059
I can help.

575
00:34:58,155 --> 00:35:00,168
No... It's too risky
yo involve a mortal.

576
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,765
What have we got to lose?

577
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:03,172
We've been searching
for three centuries..

578
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,802
This is what comes from
contact with mortals!

579
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:06,878
Disrespect!
Insolence!

580
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,595
Frederick, he does have a point.

581
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:12,022
All right.

582
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,984
Help if you can, but do not think

583
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,646
to change your mind and
betray us

584
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,426
to our most hateful enemy,
or my wrath will be revealed.

585
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:22,311
Am I clear?

586
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:30,203
I think my father likes you.

587
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:31,642
That...

588
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,015
Was liking me?

589
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:34,964
I know he can seem like a
real monster

590
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:36,562
Because he's so stern with us.

591
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:37,776
He is a monster.

592
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:39,149
But you don't know what it's like

593
00:35:39,245 --> 00:35:40,715
for us vampires to be so tormented.

594
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:42,600
Oh, yeah, I do.
It happens to me

595
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,070
Every day at school.

596
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,955
Who dares torment my friend?

597
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,191
Flint!

598
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:06,213
Flint!

599
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:08,099
Wake up!
Wake up!

600
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:16,662
I am

601
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,825
The Lord Of The Underworld.

602
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,125
I am your master.

603
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:27,909
It's Tony Thompson.

604
00:36:28,004 --> 00:36:29,187
Get him!

605
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,477
I don't think so.

606
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:42,383
I am the fiendish friend
of Tony Thompson.

607
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,460
If you do not treat him with respect,

608
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:46,505
you'll feel my wrath!

609
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,348
Tell anybody what you
have just witnessed,

610
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:51,713
and you will be bat bait.

611
00:36:56,985 --> 00:36:58,583
What on earth is going on in here?

612
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:05,133
Nothing.

613
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,304
Cora.

614
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,253
Nancy.

615
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:49,418
Sleep well last night, Girls?

616
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,175
Carry these.

617
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,092
Yes, Master.

618
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:07,312
In three months' time,
the weather gods permitting,

619
00:38:07,408 --> 00:38:10,251
McAshton's will become
Scotland's calling card

620
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:12,264
to not only the golf world,

621
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,542
But...

622
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,852
Playing games...

623
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:16,066
While corruption festers

624
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,271
beneath your feet?
Typical.

625
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,837
What do you mean, busting in here?

626
00:38:19,932 --> 00:38:21,818
Much as I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings,

627
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:23,639
You need to know.

628
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,652
You have an infestation of vampires.

629
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:31,276
Do you know who you're talking to?

630
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:33,225
I might ask you the same thing.

631
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,406
Obviously a madman.

632
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:37,155
I'll show him the door myself.

633
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:42,842
Obviously, a madman.

634
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:45,206
Now what's all this talk
about vampires?

635
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:48,243
You don't seem terribly
surprised, My Lord.

636
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:49,776
Well, one has heard rumors.

637
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,086
Legends.

638
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:52,683
Nonsense, of course.

639
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:54,473
But wouldn't you like it
sorted out once and for all

640
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,199
by a trained professional?
In fact,

641
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,179
By the only trained professional?

642
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:00,065
Now, I will admit that my fee

643
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,854
is substantial.

644
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,196
Fee?

645
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,889
I have to pay you a fee? For what?

646
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:06,456
For putting an end to your worries.

647
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:08,052
And face facts, My Lord,

648
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,705
you do have worries.

649
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:15,689
Has there been any biting in town?

650
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:18,117
No.
Not to my knowledge.

651
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:19,396
Well then,

652
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,706
show me a biting.

653
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,143
There'll be no question of fees

654
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,614
Until I see proof.

655
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,818
Now... Leave.

656
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:31,920
They think this is still
some kind of public service.

657
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:37,927
Afternoon tea... Mm...

658
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:40,293
Very civilized, very...

659
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,216
Stags are deers with horns, right?

660
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:49,623
Male deers.

661
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:50,900
Yeah.

662
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,274
Lots of Scottish Crests
have those.

663
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:53,744
Lots?
Yeah.

664
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,821
It means they descended from hunters.

665
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:58,122
So...

666
00:39:58,218 --> 00:39:59,240
Tony,

667
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:00,965
Why so interested in Crests

668
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:02,275
All of a sudden?

669
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:04,193
It's sort of...

670
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,311
A new hobby.

671
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:06,973
Tony?

672
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:08,601
What are you really up to?

673
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,477
McAshton has stags on his Crest, see?

674
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:24,482
Can I have this?

675
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:25,760
Sure.
Go ahead.

676
00:40:25,952 --> 00:40:27,454
And, Dad,

677
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,115
Can I go to work with you tomorrow?

678
00:40:31,415 --> 00:40:32,918
Uh, it's Saturday.
Yeah. Why?

679
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,794
To check out your project.

680
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:37,870
Great.

681
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:40,841
Will Lord McAshton be there?

682
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:42,758
He lives there, Buddy.
But don't let that stop you.

683
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:44,133
I won't.

684
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:47,009
Tony!

685
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:48,286
Well...

686
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:49,885
Be proud he finally has an interest

687
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,226
in something normal.

688
00:40:51,322 --> 00:40:52,856
Enough weirdness going on
around here.

689
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,805
No wonder he's having nightmares.

690
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:56,115
What do you mean?

691
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:58,608
My presentation got
interrupted today

692
00:40:58,703 --> 00:40:59,725
By a guy claiming the village

693
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:01,483
was infested by vampires.

694
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,432
You're making that up.

695
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,774
What guy?

696
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:13,018
I've got no family.

697
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:14,423
No one to be with.

698
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,788
Just me and all these dead people.

699
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:18,353
I'll drink to that.

700
00:41:20,015 --> 00:41:21,325
To dead people.

701
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:23,945
And... to The Living Dead.

702
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,095
Oh, come on.

703
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,948
You're either alive or dead.

704
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:29,249
There ain't no in-between, Pal.

705
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,199
Unless you're a vampire.

706
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:32,604
Vampires?

707
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,202
Heh heh!

708
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:35,831
You must be joking.

709
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,429
I knew you'd laugh.

710
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:38,546
It's only natural.

711
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:39,826
But we've been hunting them

712
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:41,199
for over 400 years.

713
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:42,989
That long?

714
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,769
It's a family business,
you might say.

715
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,333
For a hunter,

716
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,570
you wear an awful lot of jewelry.

717
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:51,552
This thing...

718
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:54,842
The vampires

719
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:56,440
Have one just like it.

720
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:58,836
But with one small difference.

721
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,562
Theirs is designed to help them.

722
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:01,873
This is designed

723
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:03,406
to send them straight to hell.

724
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:05,739
All I need is the stone,

725
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,112
and the magic is complete.

726
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,742
Heh heh heh!

727
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:10,850
Now it's..
It's magic.

728
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:15,771
There is a whole other
world out there...

729
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,934
If you just know how to look
for it.

730
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,929
What's that?

731
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,910
There.

732
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:25,868
What is it?

733
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:27,146
Ohh...

734
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:28,936
We're in luck.
Come on!

735
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,262
Wha-what is this?

736
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:37,403
This wasn't here yesterday.

737
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,320
This? Oh, yeah.
I built this.

738
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:40,821
I'll explain it later.

739
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,037
Now...

740
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:44,273
It must've gone down here.

741
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,509
I'm going after it.

742
00:42:46,604 --> 00:42:47,884
Wait!

743
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,705
It's my graveyard.

744
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:50,791
It's my job.

745
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:51,750
I'll do it.

746
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:53,283
Ahem!

747
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:54,944
Well, uh...

748
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,708
If you insist.

749
00:42:56,804 --> 00:42:59,594
But take this safety line.

750
00:43:00,972 --> 00:43:03,282
Not that I'll need it!

751
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,840
There you are.

752
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:09,053
Heh heh heh!

753
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,304
And...

754
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,196
Down we go.

755
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,510
Down I go...

756
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:14,953
Heh heh heh!
Yeah.

757
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:46,570
Whoa...

758
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,751
Come on...

759
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:50,738
You know you want it.

760
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:28,319
Aah!

761
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,007
Oh, ha ha ha!
Yeah!

762
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,963
Oh, ho!

763
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,085
The line grows taut.

764
00:44:35,181 --> 00:44:37,394
His heart pounds.

765
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,351
He knows what's on the other
end of the line,

766
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:42,269
And he relishes the fight!

767
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,145
Hey.. oof!
Let me down!

768
00:44:54,004 --> 00:44:55,800
Here we come.
Yes!

769
00:44:55,897 --> 00:44:57,628
Let go, Gregory, let go!

770
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:58,718
It's a trap!

771
00:44:58,814 --> 00:45:00,962
Gregory!
Let go!

772
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:03,528
Oh, yeah!

773
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:04,939
Mmm...

774
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,542
Here you come, here you come...

775
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:11,993
Bingo!

776
00:45:21,774 --> 00:45:23,729
You bit him?

777
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:25,685
Just a taste.

778
00:45:25,781 --> 00:45:27,738
Was it worth betraying your family?

779
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:30,399
Well, you're the traitor,

780
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,579
Forever denying the truth of us.

781
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:34,568
We are The Dark Gods,

782
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,171
but you've turned us into cowards,

783
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,031
skulking around our holes
like worms!

784
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,313
What would you have us do?

785
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:40,628
Fight back!

786
00:45:40,724 --> 00:45:42,167
Make these mortals' blood run cold!

787
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:44,828
And you could do it, Gregory.

788
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:47,073
You're young, strong, ruthless...

789
00:45:47,169 --> 00:45:48,709
And willing to risk a stake
through the heart

790
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:49,895
to prove it.

791
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:51,691
Better a stake than this prison!

792
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:07,210
Do you think me oblivious?

793
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:11,474
What does it matter to you
what I think?

794
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:14,906
It matters greatly.
I feel your sting.

795
00:46:15,002 --> 00:46:17,214
But you are Frederick The Great.

796
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,176
You feel nothing!

797
00:46:18,272 --> 00:46:20,934
Let there be light!

798
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:26,354
Run!

799
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,758
We've uncovered a whole flock!

800
00:46:28,854 --> 00:46:31,998
Oh, thank you so much for
your public spirit.

801
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:39,917
Aah!

802
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,986
Oh, My Hero!

803
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,557
Wow.

804
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:53,257
Who did that?

805
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:02,555
Hey!

806
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:05,667
I found out about The Coat Of Arms.

807
00:47:05,763 --> 00:47:08,295
It's Lord McAshton's,
my father's boss.

808
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:10,828
The missing stone must be at
his house.

809
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:15,157
Did you hear me, Sir?

810
00:47:15,254 --> 00:47:17,754
You barely saved my life.

811
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,038
He's very, very weak.

812
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:21,666
I know just what you need.

813
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,321
Now...

814
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:39,014
I must find a place to hide
you children

815
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,682
You can stay at my house.

816
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:43,952
We need darkness, dampness,
and decay.

817
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,005
Then you need our cellar.

818
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:18,808
I'm sorry, it's..

819
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:20,378
It's perfect!

820
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:22,495
I need to go upstairs,

821
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:24,964
But have a good day's sleep.

822
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,011
And don't worry, I'm on it.

823
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:30,031
On... On what, Dear?

824
00:48:30,127 --> 00:48:32,115
Finding the amulet, Mother.

825
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:34,327
That's how we kids talk today.

826
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,059
Oh.

827
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:38,240
Bye, Dude.
Bye, Dude.

828
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:51,964
Bob.

829
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,214
Bob, I hear something moving.

830
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:55,683
I don't hear anything.

831
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,863
Tony might be having a nightmare.

832
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,787
Go check on him, poor little guy.

833
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:00,749
It's not my turn.

834
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:02,642
It is your turn.

835
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:03,604
Really?

836
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,887
Really.

837
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:00,584
Tony.

838
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:03,246
Hnn?

839
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:04,913
Oh.

840
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:07,125
I thought you were my dad again.

841
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,210
Don't be surprised.

842
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:11,615
I only want you to have this.

843
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,323
It's from the old country.

844
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:19,471
It will bring you luck.

845
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,909
And if you ever need me,

846
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:23,511
just whistle.

847
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,371
You know how to whistle,

848
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:27,070
Don't you?

849
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:05,036
Sweet mother in heaven!

850
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:15,041
Good morning! Hey...

851
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:16,579
Good morning, Mom.

852
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:17,831
Wow, today's the day

853
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:19,659
I get to go to work with dad!

854
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:20,813
Yeah, I know.

855
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:21,999
Why don't you invite Rudolph?

856
00:51:22,095 --> 00:51:23,634
He couldn't make it.

857
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,885
Ah, the mysterious stranger.

858
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,553
Oh, he's around.

859
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,316
Well, it would be nice to
meet him

860
00:51:28,412 --> 00:51:29,951
One of these days,

861
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:31,363
Maybe have his parents over
for dinner.

862
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:34,504
Actually, they'd rather
have you for dinner.

863
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,269
Either way is fine.

864
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:37,615
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go.

865
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:39,026
Okay.

866
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,263
Lord McAshton.

867
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,129
Ah!

868
00:51:54,225 --> 00:51:55,379
Take these, please.

869
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:56,694
Hey, I'd like you to meet my
son Tony.

870
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,752
Finally.

871
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,612
Little Tony Thompson.

872
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:01,921
Let's feel that firm American grip.

873
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:06,956
Shake Lord McAshton's hand.

874
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:09,521
Tony's very excited to hear
about your family history.

875
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:10,739
Aren't you, Tony?

876
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:12,567
Uh... Not right now, I'm not.

877
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:14,811
Well, it's a noble history indeed.

878
00:52:14,907 --> 00:52:16,864
The McAshton's have ruled
in these counties

879
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,922
Since time...

880
00:52:18,018 --> 00:52:20,070
Immemorial.

881
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:25,008
You'll have to excuse me.

882
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,894
Tony...

883
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,337
You stay away from that guy.

884
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:31,164
He's crazy.

885
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:32,255
I told you

886
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,313
Not to come back!

887
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:35,141
Unless..

888
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:38,412
"Unless" is exactly what's
happened, My Lord.

889
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,306
Aah!

890
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:47,326
Not the kind of holes that
are good

891
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:49,571
For the golfing business, eh,
My Lord?

892
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,424
A biting right here in McAshtonland.

893
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,707
And there'll be more...

894
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:55,983
Unless we come to some arrangement.

895
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:01,820
It's Elizabeth...

896
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:04,417
and her Demon Lover, isn't it?

897
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,726
They've returned.

898
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:09,355
I told you you had worries.

899
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:10,605
Oh, come in.

900
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:12,466
If we got up here...

901
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:14,005
On 18...

902
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:15,191
Uh... Yeah.

903
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:17,179
Yeah... If we can...

904
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:20,001
Crest up, okay, before the green,

905
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:22,053
I think we can lose the sand
traps from 18,

906
00:53:22,149 --> 00:53:23,785
and that way...

907
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:42,222
our ancestor, Elizabeth McAshton.

908
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:51,457
The Stone of Attamon!

909
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:55,048
My Grandfather told me the legend.

910
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:56,909
He said it was to die with me.

911
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:59,602
It could still happen.

912
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,878
She saw a ship...

913
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:03,802
Foundered upon the rocks...

914
00:54:03,898 --> 00:54:07,202
Though there had been no storm...

915
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:10,055
No sign of life.
No crew, save one

916
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:13,294
who crawled ashore injured.

917
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,057
But he was no mortal man.

918
00:54:15,153 --> 00:54:17,495
His name was Von.

919
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,804
Von Sackville-Bagge.

920
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,407
A vampire.

921
00:54:21,503 --> 00:54:23,202
Elizabeth was taken by this Von

922
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:25,639
and became one of the undead herself.

923
00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:27,692
And then what?

924
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:30,737
Our family staked her.
And Von.

925
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,143
Warm-hearted bunch, aren't you?

926
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,227
You of all people should understand.

927
00:54:35,323 --> 00:54:36,573
I'm joking, My Lord.

928
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:39,235
I would've done the same myself.

929
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:41,191
So where is she buried?

930
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:42,474
Why?

931
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,173
Like you said,

932
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:46,418
We want to know if she's
walking around.

933
00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:48,502
If I was a McAshton,

934
00:54:48,598 --> 00:54:50,938
I wouldn't want her looking
for me.

935
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:54,466
How do you like tour stake,
My Lord?

936
00:54:55,717 --> 00:54:57,513
Ha ha!

937
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,158
Boo!

938
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:17,426
You're blocking the Lord
Of The Inderworld!

939
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,547
We.. we don't mean to!

940
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,582
I want you to crawl back to
your room,

941
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:25,473
get under the bed,

942
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:26,885
and stay there!

943
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:29,643
Y-yes, Lord Underworld.

944
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,068
I said, crawl!

945
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:48,561
Ahem!
Allow me, My Lord.

946
00:55:48,657 --> 00:55:50,037
I'm an expert.

947
00:55:53,563 --> 00:55:55,039
All part of the service.

948
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:23,448
Here.

949
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:36,659
She was moved.

950
00:56:38,712 --> 00:56:39,867
But no one's been down here

951
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,341
since mother died.

952
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,115
I'm talking about centuries ago,
My Lord.

953
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:54,071
And judging from what I see...

954
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:56,829
The tomb is just here for show.

955
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:59,650
She's in an unmarked grave
wrapped in chains

956
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:02,056
with a wooden stake through
her ribs,

957
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,370
the coffin purified.

958
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:04,685
Why?

959
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,321
Well, do you really
want your mom

960
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:07,860
to be buried next to a vampire?

961
00:57:07,956 --> 00:57:09,495
No! No!
I loved mother!

962
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:11,258
She always smelled of gardenias.

963
00:57:11,355 --> 00:57:12,734
Shut up.

964
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,202
Then they buried her in
unhallowed ground,

965
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:17,384
Probably outside the
churchyard walls.

966
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,040
That's acres worth of land!

967
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,133
Which is why I come equipped with

968
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:23,160
State-of-the-art vampire locators

969
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,951
That you're paying so dearly for,
My Lord.

970
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,530
The little vampire sympathizer!

971
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:34,415
Yaaah!
Aah!

972
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:38,088
Ohh... Now...

973
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:39,557
You've made your bed,

974
00:57:39,652 --> 00:57:40,579
Now...

975
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:43,262
You can sleep in it!

976
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:45,466
No!

977
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:47,064
Nooo!

978
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:49,235
You can't do that.

979
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:50,577
Let me out!
It's murder!

980
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:52,972
He's just a boy!
Thompson's son.

981
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:54,059
He's one of them.

982
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:55,496
I've seen them all together

983
00:57:55,592 --> 00:57:57,029
Slithering in the night.

984
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:58,786
I must tell his parents!

985
00:57:58,881 --> 00:57:59,808
Let me out!

986
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,629
Now...

987
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:03,608
There are plenty of ways

988
00:58:03,704 --> 00:58:05,462
To get your throat punctured,
My Lord.

989
00:58:05,557 --> 00:58:07,825
Don't make me be the one.

990
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,509
Let me out!

991
00:58:10,604 --> 00:58:12,936
All right, j-just tell me what to do.

992
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,149
Right.
That's better.

993
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:17,791
Now, go away...
And remember...

994
00:59:09,568 --> 00:59:11,229
What?

995
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,040
Tony's calling.

996
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:15,413
He could be in danger.

997
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:19,374
Maybe he's found the stone.

998
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:21,163
Let's go.

999
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:22,313
Oh, the drama..

1000
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:23,878
Shh!

1001
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:28,382
Oh, Dear!
The sun.

1002
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:30,394
Daylight or not, we must go.

1003
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:34,387
Where are you going?

1004
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:36,718
You stay here.
Shh!

1005
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,954
Left, right, Left, right,

1006
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,232
Left, right...

1007
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:43,905
Left, right, Left, right,

1008
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:44,959
Left, right, left...

1009
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:49,015
Left, right, Left, right,

1010
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:50,037
Left, right, Left, right...

1011
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,731
Tony!

1012
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,564
What do you mean

1013
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,618
by running off like that today?

1014
00:59:56,714 --> 00:59:58,183
You had me worried sick.

1015
00:59:59,588 --> 01:00:00,739
Well, that's not good..

1016
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,859
Wait, I suppose...

1017
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:06,040
This is Rudolph under here.

1018
01:00:07,447 --> 01:00:08,564
Okay.

1019
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,449
Well, this isn't your fault, Rudolph.

1020
01:00:10,544 --> 01:00:12,684
But when you get home tonight,
Tony Thompson,

1021
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,409
We're having a serious talk.

1022
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:17,891
Okay.

1023
01:00:17,987 --> 01:00:20,605
Well... Go on and play your game...

1024
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:21,564
Left, right...

1025
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,906
Whatever it is.

1026
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:24,247
Left, right, Left, right...

1027
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,153
And what's that all about?

1028
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,847
Tony ran off from work today

1029
01:00:28,942 --> 01:00:30,444
and I got really worried.

1030
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,296
But I was so happy he was
playing with a friend

1031
01:00:32,393 --> 01:00:34,341
and not obsessing about vampires.

1032
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,215
Amen, husband of mine.

1033
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:41,400
Which means we get the afternoon alone.

1034
01:00:41,495 --> 01:00:43,923
Mm. I like this Rudolph already.

1035
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:46,191
His parents want to have us
for dinner.

1036
01:00:48,747 --> 01:00:50,950
Tony!
Are you all right?

1037
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:52,834
Yeah.

1038
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,559
Dude, you heard me!

1039
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:57,530
I heard you, My Hero,
and I wrote you a poem.

1040
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:00,213
Who did this to you?

1041
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:02,608
Rookery.
We better find Elizabeth's Tomb

1042
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:03,950
Before he does.

1043
01:01:04,046 --> 01:01:06,793
It's about the power of love.

1044
01:01:06,889 --> 01:01:07,975
Who's Elizabeth?

1045
01:01:08,071 --> 01:01:09,380
The last holder of the stone.

1046
01:01:09,476 --> 01:01:10,658
The woman in my dreams.

1047
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,181
"Your face saw I in the cemetery,

1048
01:01:13,277 --> 01:01:14,651
Filled with fright...

1049
01:01:14,747 --> 01:01:15,769
Rudolph, look!

1050
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:17,494
For the night was scary.

1051
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,400
Still, you faced the foe

1052
01:01:20,496 --> 01:01:21,359
undaunted.

1053
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:22,508
It was there...

1054
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:23,849
It wants to lead us somewhere.

1055
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:26,310
It was you I wanted...

1056
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:28,322
To hold me when the winds are..."

1057
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,420
Behind the pillar, look!

1058
01:01:31,515 --> 01:01:33,017
Hey!

1059
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:37,073
It's a door.

1060
01:01:37,169 --> 01:01:38,703
A secret passage!

1061
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,354
This could lead to Elizabeth's grave.

1062
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,388
I wish we had a better light.

1063
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:47,167
Wait, Rookery seems to have
left this behind.

1064
01:01:47,263 --> 01:01:48,508
Thanks.

1065
01:02:23,325 --> 01:02:26,327
Gone.
All of them.

1066
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:29,425
They could've gone to the cliffs.

1067
01:02:30,735 --> 01:02:32,587
Tonight's the night.

1068
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:34,599
Mortality beckons.

1069
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:39,328
Gregory.

1070
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,978
He's stolen the amulet.

1071
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:43,767
He will crush our hopes.

1072
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:46,098
His final mockery.

1073
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:47,696
No.

1074
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:49,197
He's a rebel, but...

1075
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:52,487
But treachery is beyond him.

1076
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,818
If he has taken the amulet...

1077
01:02:54,914 --> 01:02:57,502
It's to make the call.

1078
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,920
Then we should go to the cliff too.

1079
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:06,286
I'm still very weak.

1080
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:07,915
I would fall from the sky

1081
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:09,000
If I flew.

1082
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:11,268
We'll find a way.

1083
01:03:11,364 --> 01:03:13,600
Not like him to stay out this late.

1084
01:03:13,696 --> 01:03:15,230
What's "Like him" these days,

1085
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:17,306
ever since he met that Rudolph?

1086
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:18,583
I thought you liked him?

1087
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:20,212
I never really met him.

1088
01:03:20,308 --> 01:03:22,512
Well, I mean, I did,
but he was wrapped in foil.

1089
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:25,003
I know,
but we've never even seen him.

1090
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:26,664
We've never met his parents.

1091
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,527
Probably foreigners.

1092
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:28,901
Foreigners?

1093
01:03:28,996 --> 01:03:30,753
We are the foreigners.

1094
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,244
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

1095
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:36,631
Or the coppers,
whatever you call them.

1096
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,739
Bobbies.

1097
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,210
Yes, hi, this is Dottie Thompson.

1098
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:44,902
I'm calling about my son.

1099
01:03:47,267 --> 01:03:49,055
You can't understand me?

1100
01:03:49,151 --> 01:03:50,652
You know what?
Forget it.

1101
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:51,834
I'll call you back.

1102
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,271
I'm Freda Sackville-Bagge.

1103
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:56,018
That's...

1104
01:03:56,114 --> 01:03:57,200
Wonderful.

1105
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:58,702
Rudolph's mother.

1106
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:02,471
I'm sure you're worried
about Tony.

1107
01:04:02,566 --> 01:04:04,387
Tony?

1108
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:05,856
Your son.

1109
01:04:05,952 --> 01:04:08,924
We know who he is.
We want to know where..

1110
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,265
Tony is going to the cliff

1111
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:12,244
with Rudolph and Anna to watch
the comet.

1112
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:14,034
Anna?

1113
01:04:14,129 --> 01:04:16,590
Our daughter.

1114
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:18,889
Dare I say your charming young man

1115
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:21,635
has cast quite a spell on her.

1116
01:04:21,731 --> 01:04:23,680
Well, we think he's charming.

1117
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,628
Frederick Sackville-Bagge.

1118
01:04:25,724 --> 01:04:27,768
At your service.

1119
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:32,176
Hi.

1120
01:04:32,272 --> 01:04:34,125
How about it, Bob?

1121
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:35,562
Want to see a comet?

1122
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:37,000
Sure.

1123
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:39,395
Are...

1124
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:41,471
We supposed to be in costume,

1125
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:42,558
like you guys?

1126
01:04:42,654 --> 01:04:43,260
Costume?

1127
01:04:43,452 --> 01:04:44,666
Uh...

1128
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:46,422
Shakespearean Aristocratic thing

1129
01:04:46,518 --> 01:04:47,476
like you guys?

1130
01:04:47,572 --> 01:04:48,626
I don't wear the costume

1131
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,128
of an aristocrat.

1132
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:52,555
I am an aristocrat.

1133
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,599
Okay.

1134
01:04:54,694 --> 01:04:55,845
Whatever.

1135
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:58,177
We should hurry.
It's urgent.

1136
01:04:58,273 --> 01:04:59,294
Urgent?

1137
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,860
Well, the comet is near.

1138
01:05:01,882 --> 01:05:02,872
Oh.

1139
01:05:08,398 --> 01:05:10,090
We must be near the cemetery.

1140
01:05:10,283 --> 01:05:11,497
Follow me.

1141
01:05:11,592 --> 01:05:14,243
To the ends of the earth, My Darling.

1142
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:15,648
Where's your car?

1143
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:16,959
We flew.

1144
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,003
Let's take yours.

1145
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:30,533
Hold up, Thompson!

1146
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:32,291
I've got a job for you.

1147
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,142
You might not like it.

1148
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:35,994
Oh, we didn't like it 300
years ago,

1149
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:38,008
But we did our duty.
That's the point.

1150
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:39,157
Duty.

1151
01:05:39,253 --> 01:05:41,042
Use the blunt end of the ax.

1152
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:42,447
One... Two... Three.

1153
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:44,875
It's over.

1154
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,248
What are you talking about?

1155
01:05:46,344 --> 01:05:47,557
You have to drive this stake

1156
01:05:47,654 --> 01:05:48,708
through Tony's heart.

1157
01:05:48,804 --> 01:05:50,113
Oh, my God!

1158
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:52,509
No worries.
He's already dead.

1159
01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:54,553
He's a vampire, Bob.

1160
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,470
It's not easy for a father to hear,

1161
01:05:56,566 --> 01:05:58,450
but your son's a bloodsucking fiend.

1162
01:05:58,546 --> 01:05:59,568
Okay, don't worry.

1163
01:05:59,663 --> 01:06:00,271
I'll handle this.

1164
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:01,452
Take them.

1165
01:06:01,548 --> 01:06:02,858
You'll thank me in the morning.

1166
01:06:02,954 --> 01:06:04,742
I've had enough

1167
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:07,841
Of all you people and all
your vampire bs!

1168
01:06:07,937 --> 01:06:09,565
And don't call Tony a vampire

1169
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:10,939
Ever again!

1170
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:14,453
And how dare you embarrass me
and my wife

1171
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:15,794
in front of our guests?

1172
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:18,349
These are aristocrats!

1173
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:22,694
Aristocrats?

1174
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:24,355
Yes, My Lord.

1175
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,845
And Tony happens to be
my son's best friend.

1176
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,753
and Robert is right.
Tony is no vampire.

1177
01:06:29,848 --> 01:06:31,829
Now drop that ax

1178
01:06:31,925 --> 01:06:32,883
And take your leave.

1179
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:35,182
Yeah, take your leave,

1180
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:37,993
or you'll be building your
own golf course, Buddy!

1181
01:06:38,089 --> 01:06:40,165
All right.

1182
01:06:40,357 --> 01:06:41,476
I'm leaving.

1183
01:06:42,912 --> 01:06:44,286
You hear that, Dottie?

1184
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:45,404
Oww!

1185
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,161
I told him to take his leave.

1186
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:48,662
You were wonderful!

1187
01:06:48,758 --> 01:06:51,154
Bob... The comet.

1188
01:06:52,974 --> 01:06:54,156
My lady.

1189
01:07:00,608 --> 01:07:02,653
Those aren't aristocrats.

1190
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:06,133
Those are vampires!

1191
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:24,532
We have to keep moving.
Time is running out.

1192
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:26,353
We can't go any further.

1193
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,812
Why not?

1194
01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:33,157
There's something ahead.

1195
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:34,881
Some kind of curse.

1196
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:38,235
You have to go first, Tony Dearest.

1197
01:07:52,832 --> 01:07:54,014
I found it!

1198
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,739
Go see what it is.

1199
01:07:57,048 --> 01:07:59,093
But be careful.

1200
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:06,695
There's something written on here.

1201
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:10,401
"Caveat... Vamptor."

1202
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:12,444
"Let the vampire beware."

1203
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,721
It's a curse.

1204
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:16,788
Stupid chains.
Break. Break!

1205
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:18,608
Come on!

1206
01:08:18,704 --> 01:08:20,110
We need a miracle.

1207
01:08:29,629 --> 01:08:31,194
Oh, no.

1208
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,727
Oh, yes!

1209
01:08:53,522 --> 01:08:54,830
Yeah!
The curse is gone!

1210
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:55,757
Yes!

1211
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:58,823
Whoa!

1212
01:09:06,712 --> 01:09:09,268
Let's try and open it.

1213
01:09:09,364 --> 01:09:11,216
One, two, three, pull!

1214
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:12,366
Now!

1215
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,916
It's Elizabeth.

1216
01:09:22,012 --> 01:09:23,514
Uncle Von.

1217
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:25,845
Father was right.
He did come here.

1218
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:27,474
Oh, how romantic!

1219
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,935
Their love, preserved forever.

1220
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:34,758
The stone isn't here.

1221
01:09:46,288 --> 01:09:47,629
Up here!
Up here!

1222
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,034
Ohh...

1223
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,539
Getting away!
Get her! Get her!

1224
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,510
Here!

1225
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,310
The stone is in my room!

1226
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:42,237
No wonder I had those dreams!

1227
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:47,535
Thank you for sharing that
with me.

1228
01:10:47,632 --> 01:10:48,853
Heh heh heh!

1229
01:11:16,823 --> 01:11:18,878
What?

1230
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,388
What's happening?

1231
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,336
The call.

1232
01:11:23,432 --> 01:11:25,160
You go to the cliffs.
We'll get the stone.

1233
01:11:25,256 --> 01:11:26,536
Okay, let's go.

1234
01:11:31,017 --> 01:11:33,096
Robert, could you drive
a little faster, please?

1235
01:11:33,192 --> 01:11:35,337
Darling, do you hear?

1236
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:37,289
Hear what?

1237
01:11:37,384 --> 01:11:39,305
The call.

1238
01:11:39,401 --> 01:11:41,770
It's Gregory, our eldest son.

1239
01:11:41,866 --> 01:11:43,849
He's calling the clan.

1240
01:11:47,593 --> 01:11:49,194
Yeah.

1241
01:12:01,836 --> 01:12:04,427
Mother!
Father!

1242
01:12:04,524 --> 01:12:06,060
We found Uncle Von's grave.

1243
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,564
I mean, Tony found it,

1244
01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:09,099
And he saw the stone in a vision.

1245
01:12:09,195 --> 01:12:10,732
He and Rudolph are after it now.

1246
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,332
May their quest be fruitful.

1247
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:15,469
Thank you, Gregory.

1248
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,294
Something weird is happening here.

1249
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:36,814
Bob!

1250
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,574
Oh, God!

1251
01:12:40,559 --> 01:12:42,511
Aah!
Oh!

1252
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:44,911
Don't worry, everything
is gonna be fine.

1253
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:47,791
Okay, just stay calm.

1254
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:49,936
Freda says we're gonna be fine.

1255
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,792
Hi.

1256
01:12:51,888 --> 01:12:52,656
Uh...

1257
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:53,968
My name's Bob...

1258
01:12:54,064 --> 01:12:56,657
And this is my wife, Dottie.

1259
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,825
Good night for a gathering, huh?

1260
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:01,681
Leave them alone.
They're friends.

1261
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,473
What?
Since when?

1262
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,065
Where is it?

1263
01:13:10,161 --> 01:13:11,826
Somewhere around here!

1264
01:13:11,922 --> 01:13:13,233
How do you know?

1265
01:13:13,329 --> 01:13:15,763
How do I know?
I have visions, Dude.

1266
01:13:16,915 --> 01:13:18,451
No need to bite my head off.

1267
01:13:18,547 --> 01:13:19,699
Biting is your job.

1268
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,579
Mine is to find the amulet.

1269
01:13:22,675 --> 01:13:23,923
We've got to find it.

1270
01:13:32,243 --> 01:13:33,236
Rookery!

1271
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:08,695
♪ I'm coming...

1272
01:14:30,297 --> 01:14:32,378
Oh! Aw, Boys...

1273
01:14:32,474 --> 01:14:33,849
You've locked the door.

1274
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:45,051
I found it!

1275
01:14:49,434 --> 01:14:51,003
The Stone Of Attamon.

1276
01:14:59,452 --> 01:15:00,828
Hand it over.

1277
01:15:00,924 --> 01:15:03,164
It belongs to my friend.

1278
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,085
No, no, no, no.
It belongs to me now.

1279
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:05,981
Give.

1280
01:15:06,077 --> 01:15:08,061
Not without a fight.

1281
01:15:08,157 --> 01:15:10,205
Oh? Well, I can't be bothered.

1282
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:17,758
Tony!

1283
01:15:17,853 --> 01:15:20,446
Don't give him the stone!

1284
01:15:23,006 --> 01:15:23,902
Aah!

1285
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:28,351
Let me go!

1286
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:32,223
Get in there!

1287
01:15:49,984 --> 01:15:51,073
Get out of the way!

1288
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:55,330
Get out of the way!

1289
01:16:01,826 --> 01:16:02,274
Give me that stone.

1290
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,002
No!

1291
01:16:04,098 --> 01:16:06,563
I said give me that stone!

1292
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:07,907
My friends need it.

1293
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:10,563
Oh, boo-hoo!

1294
01:16:10,658 --> 01:16:12,162
I need it, Laddie...

1295
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:16,452
To send them straight to hell.

1296
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,775
What do you want?

1297
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:02,055
You want this?

1298
01:17:02,152 --> 01:17:05,224
Well, come and get it.

1299
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:14,089
Ngggh...

1300
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:16,361
Yaaah!

1301
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:18,474
Aah!

1302
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,778
Yee-haa!

1303
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:27,498
Whoa!

1304
01:17:40,588 --> 01:17:41,771
Whoa!

1305
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:42,764
Aah!

1306
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:51,213
Hey!

1307
01:17:51,309 --> 01:17:52,620
Hey!

1308
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:54,029
Oh, no, you don't.
Give me that.

1309
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,941
Ha ha ha!

1310
01:17:58,894 --> 01:18:00,750
Tony, the lights!

1311
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:03,214
Turn off the lights!

1312
01:18:05,582 --> 01:18:07,598
Hey!

1313
01:18:07,694 --> 01:18:08,910
You leave that alone!
Stop that!

1314
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:11,534
Sit back!

1315
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,134
Tony!

1316
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:19,023
Hey!
You!

1317
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:20,112
Whoo-hoo!

1318
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:24,688
Oh-oh-oh...

1319
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,800
Whoa-aah...

1320
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:33,872
Going...

1321
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:35,665
Going...

1322
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:37,585
Gone!

1323
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:43,154
We have only a few moments more.

1324
01:18:45,874 --> 01:18:47,986
After all of our wandering...

1325
01:18:48,082 --> 01:18:49,298
All of our waiting...

1326
01:18:49,394 --> 01:18:50,739
I've left our fate in the hands

1327
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,210
of two small boys.

1328
01:18:52,306 --> 01:18:53,811
It's all my fault.

1329
01:18:53,907 --> 01:18:55,602
I won't even ask your forgiveness.

1330
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:57,522
I don't deserve it.

1331
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:04,468
Rudolph.

1332
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,244
You've got it.

1333
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,268
All right!

1334
01:19:09,364 --> 01:19:10,516
Yeah!

1335
01:19:24,821 --> 01:19:26,550
Aah!

1336
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:29,174
Yeah!

1337
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,222
Tony's near.

1338
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:32,246
Where?

1339
01:19:32,342 --> 01:19:33,302
What'd she say?

1340
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:34,807
There!

1341
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,982
In the sky!

1342
01:19:38,454 --> 01:19:40,406
Ready...

1343
01:19:40,599 --> 01:19:42,007
Hover!

1344
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:44,408
Oh, my God!

1345
01:19:56,568 --> 01:19:58,137
I think you've been looking for this.

1346
01:19:58,233 --> 01:19:59,448
He has the amulet!

1347
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:01,305
The stone!

1348
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,017
Thank you, my friend.

1349
01:20:05,112 --> 01:20:05,977
We must get moving.

1350
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:07,224
Tony!

1351
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,265
Mom!
Dad!

1352
01:20:10,362 --> 01:20:12,889
The Stone Of Attamon is ours!

1353
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:25,659
Ab ovo...

1354
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:28,187
In toto...

1355
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:31,068
Nil desperandum...

1356
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:34,267
Sine die...

1357
01:20:59,518 --> 01:21:01,790
Hey... That's my blimp!

1358
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:08,383
Gaah!

1359
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,832
Mom! Dad!

1360
01:21:20,928 --> 01:21:22,592
And you'll go straight to hell!

1361
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,704
All right, that's it.

1362
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,280
I don't think so.

1363
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,080
Catch it, Tony!

1364
01:21:42,752 --> 01:21:44,736
Aaaaah!

1365
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:49,472
The ceremony!

1366
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,352
Tony! You know what we want!

1367
01:21:52,448 --> 01:21:53,376
Wish it!

1368
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,192
You have to wish it... Now!

1369
01:23:34,559 --> 01:23:36,415
What'd you wish for?

1370
01:24:12,127 --> 01:24:13,759
What else do you want?

1371
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,624
Hey...

1372
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,288
It's me... Tony.

1373
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,109
Nancy!

1374
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:35,811
Cora!

1375
01:26:35,907 --> 01:26:37,994
Clara!

1376
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:39,824
Bridget!

1377
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,782
Sara!
