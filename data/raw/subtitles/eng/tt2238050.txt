1
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,542
Mom?

2
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,012
- Kat?
- You okay?

3
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,315
Yeah. I'm fine.

4
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,153
Why are you
all dressed up?

5
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,291
What do you mean?

6
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,095
What time is it?

7
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,597
Almost five.

8
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,132
Really?

9
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,000
I need
to get dinner started.

10
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,014
<i>I was 17 when
my mother disappeared.</i>

11
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:22,648
Just as I was becoming nothingnbut my body, flesh and blood,

12
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,387
<i>and raging hormones.</i>

13
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,389
<i>She stepped out of hers
 and left it behind.</i>

14
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,756
Hi, Mrs. Hillman.
Is Phil home?

15
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,290
No. I'm sorry, Katrina.
He's... he's not back yet.

16
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,861
Really?

17
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,396
Supposed to pick
me up from school.

18
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,802
I'm sure he's on his way.
You know how he is.

19
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,472
Uh, w... w... would you like to
come in and... and wait for him?

20
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,675
That's okay. Just tell him
that I stopped by.

21
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,343
I will.

22
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,611
Thanks, Mrs. Hillman.

23
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,947
Oh, no problem, dear.

24
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,683
Dad?

25
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,218
What are you doing
home already?

26
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,722
Have you seen your mother?

27
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,925
No, why?

28
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,229
She's gone.

29
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,200
What do you mean
she's gone?

30
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,536
I came home
and she wasn't here.

31
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,771
She's probably
at the store or something.

32
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,307
Her car is in the garage.

33
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:37,610
Oh my god, stop being so
melodramatic. She'll turn up.

34
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,417
I called everyone.
Nobody's seen her.

35
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,419
Dad, don't worry.
I'm sure everything's fine.

36
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,623
Yeah.

37
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,826
I'm going to my room.

38
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,902
Yeah, it was weird. She didn't
leave a note or anything.

39
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,271
And dad is totally
freaking out.

40
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,274
Where do you think she is?

41
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,441
Maybe she finally left him.
She's been threatening to
for all these years.

42
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,846
Well, was she, like,
acting weird or something?

43
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,285
<i>No weirder than usual.</i>

44
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,620
Actually, no. Last week
I came home from school

45
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,256
and I found her sleeping
in my bed.

46
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,658
What?

47
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,294
Yeah. Random, Right?

48
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,664
When she woke up,
she seemed like,
all confused and out of it.

49
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,097
<i>I think she was still
 half in a dream.</i>

50
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:36,302
So, anyways, where the hell
were you today?

51
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,007
Oh, yeah.

52
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,677
Sorry, I... I was hanging out
at Thomas', and...

53
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,046
<i>And you were stoned.</i>

54
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,013
Uh, maybe.

55
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,019
You want me to come over?

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,555
<i>I don't know, I kind of have
 a lot of homework to do.</i>

57
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,624
Since when do you give
a shit about homework?

58
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,527
My mom's been on my case
lately about my grades.

59
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,494
Phil, we haven't had sex in,
like, over a week.

60
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,931
I miss fucking you.

61
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,200
Same here, babe.
But, you know what they say.

62
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,874
Absence makes
the heart get stronger.

63
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,312
Yeah.

64
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,615
Phil, are you in there?

65
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,016
I'm on the phone.

66
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,951
Could you come out here
for a minute, honey?

67
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,754
I heard a strange
noise outside.

68
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,790
You're always hearing
strange noises.

69
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,326
Yeah, I'll be out
in a sec.

70
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:34,960
I gotta go. My crazy mom
is imagining things again.

71
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,498
Hmm-kay.
Talk to you later.

72
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,903
<i>Okay.</i>

73
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,917
So, no word?

74
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,827
You think we should
call the police?

75
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:45,831
I don't want them
coming here for all
the neighbors to see.

76
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,537
Your mother
wouldn't like it.

77
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:01,847
If we don't hear
anything by morning,

78
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,087
let's take a drive
down to the station.

79
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,966
Mom?

80
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,543
Mom?

81
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,133
Mom?

82
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,001
Mom, what happened?

83
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,021
When I was little,
 my mother tried...

84
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,923
<i>to curl my hair.</i>

85
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,730
Oh, well. We tried.

86
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,198
It looks a little fuller,
I suppose.

87
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,603
She named me Katrina so
 that she could call me Kat,

88
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,273
<i>because she always
wanted a pet.</i>

89
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,241
Come here, Kat. Purr for me,
kitty. Come on. Purr.

90
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,081
Purr. Purr. Purr.

91
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,148
That's it.
Good, good little kitty.

92
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,254
For years
 I thought I was her pet.

93
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:07,206
Kat? Kat?

94
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,045
Mama?

95
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:21,920
I'm here, Kat. I'm here.

96
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,198
No more for you. God, you're
getting fatter by the hour.

97
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,370
My mother always wanted me
 to be a sylph, all lithe
and elegant like her.

98
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,778
And when I hit puberty, my body
<i>changed seemingly overnight,</i>

99
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,948
<i>the bulk melting off like
 I was a snowman in the sun.</i>

100
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,217
<i>Only, instead of finally
pleasing her,</i>

101
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,853
<i>that somehow made her
 resent me even more.</i>

102
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,187
- Do you love the boy?
- God, Jesus, you scared me.

103
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,860
How long have you been
standing there?

104
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,262
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

105
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,132
Well, are you going
to answer my question?

106
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:09,635
- What question?
- That boy next door.
Do you love him?

107
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,441
What are you talking about?
It's none of your business.

108
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,948
I don't love your father.

109
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,184
I can't stand him,
as a matter of fact.

110
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,420
What the fuck? Why would
you say that to me? Go fuckin'
tell it to someone else.

111
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,095
<i>So no note, huh?</i>

112
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,399
No. Nothing.

113
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,337
You say she
didn't pack a bag.

114
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,477
Well, nothing seems to be
missing as far as I can tell.

115
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:03,422
The detective was the
 polar opposite of men like
 my father, and Phil.

116
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,658
<i>He was the kind of man whoncarried a gun, got into fights,</i>

117
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,062
<i>killed things
 with his bare hands.</i>

118
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:10,762
Was she depressed? Was she
on any kind of medication,
or taking anything?

119
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,870
She didn't kill herself,
if that's what you're
trying to imply.

120
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,179
Well,
the good news is,

121
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,347
that there's no matches
at any of the hospitals
or morgue.

122
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,883
No evidence of foul play.

123
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,756
However, and I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

124
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,257
hundreds of wives
go missing every week.

125
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,764
If a woman wants to vanish,
buddy, she can.

126
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,066
Are you saying there's
nothing we can do?

127
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,803
Oh, sure there is.
I recommend you alert
your friends, your neighbors.

128
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,773
<i>Tell them to be
 on the lookout.</i>

129
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,874
<i>Keep an eye on your bank
 account, your credit cards,
 for any kind of activity.</i>

130
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,779
Got an answering machine?

131
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,814
Mm-hm.

132
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,251
Good, keep it on. Your wife
might try to contact you.

133
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:10,922
Feel free to call me
if anything comes up.

134
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:40,552
Dad?

135
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,122
Your mother never loved me.

136
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,864
I didn't know what to say,
 because I couldn't remember
 my mother

137
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,068
<i>ever looking at my dad
 with anything but contempt.</i>

138
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,936
<i>Maybe a zillion eons ago</i>

139
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,073
<i>when they were young,
 it was different.</i>

140
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,413
It's perfect, right?

141
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,117
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

142
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,888
She was tall,
 stunning,

143
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,990
<i>like a movie star.</i>

144
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,927
<i>They were thenquintessential American couple,</i>

145
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:22,060
<i>the future unfurling before
them like some endless
magic carpet.</i>

146
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,265
<i>If homemaking was an art
 or science, my mother would
 have won a Nobel Prize.</i>

147
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,907
<i>But once the house
 is immaculate, and
 everything was in its place,</i>

148
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:40,045
<i>she had nothing left to do
but plan the emptiness
 of days to come.</i>

149
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,949
<i>And gradually, the beautiful
 woman she once was</i>

150
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,452
became no more than a phantom,nwandering away in a snowstorm.

151
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,223
Hello, sweetheart.
What's for dinner?

152
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,460
- Meatloaf.
- Oh, yum.

153
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,497
Your meatloaf
is the cat's meow.

154
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,967
So anyway, do you remember
that ticket I bought
at the office raffle?

155
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,003
- Not really.
- Well, guess what? I won.

156
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,540
- It's a crock pot.
- We don't need a crock pot.

157
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,910
What are you talking about?
These are the latest thing.
Everyone's getting one.

158
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,114
You can make, uh, stews,
pot roast, chili.

159
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:16,381
Well, I don't have time
to fuss with it now.
I have to finish dinner.

160
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,686
Just put it out of the way. Over
there, on top of the fridge.

161
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,258
He was her doormat.
 She treated him like shit
 and he let her.

162
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,299
<i>So imagine my shock
 when I visited my father
 at work one day</i>

163
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,135
<i>and discovered he had game.</i>

164
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,173
<i>Every woman there was into him.
 Flirting with him, batting
 their eyelashes.</i>

165
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:41,339
Good morning, Mr. Connors.
And who is this pretty
young lady?

166
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,180
Good morning, Mindy. This is
Kat, the new receptionist.

167
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,183
<i>I was stunned.</i>

168
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:55,053
<i>These women actually
 thought my dad was hot.</i>

169
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,023
<i>But to my mother,
 he would always be pathetic.</i>

170
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,659
<i>A constant reminder
 of the unbearable repetition</i>

171
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,563
<i>and dullness of her life.</i>

172
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:08,667
<i>My parents' marriage was like
 a long drink of water from
 a frozen fountain.</i>

173
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,170
<i>So cold it turns your teeth
 to diamonds.</i>

174
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,205
<i>It was hardly a surprisento learn their sex life sucked.</i>

175
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,409
<i>Meanwhile, my father had
 his own drawer of secrets.</i>

176
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,188
<i>So they just went on
 like that.</i>

177
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,059
<i>My mom never coming, my dad
 jacking off in the basement,</i>

178
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,262
<i>all the while pretending
 everything</i>was fine.

179
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,399
<i>That we were the perfect
 family living this
perfect fucking life.</i>

180
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,052
Pass the butter.

181
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,630
Thank you.

182
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,299
There were times when
 I thought she was going mad,

183
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,435
<i>that she was going
to suffocate my father
 one night with a pillow,</i>

184
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,405
<i>that she was going to burn
 the fucking house down.</i>

185
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,708
<i>But instead, she vanished.</i>

186
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,078
How does that
make you feel?

187
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,513
I don't know.

188
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,082
You don't know?

189
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,216
- Do you miss her?
- No. Not really.

190
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,422
My dad made me see
 a shrink because he thought

191
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,358
I needed to process my feelings
<i>about my mother leaving.</i>

192
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,296
<i>Thing is,
 I didn't have any feelings.</i>

193
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,265
<i>Dr. Thaler reminds me of an
 actress playing a therapist.</i>

194
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,169
<i>And when we have a session,
I feel like an actress
 playing myself.</i>

195
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,536
I, I act... I have been having
kind of weird dreams lately.

196
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,711
- A bad actress.
- Doing a shitty job.

197
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,579
Like, I'm, um, I'm driving
through this gnarly
snow storm

198
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,586
<i>and I can't see anything,
 I mean, there's snow
 everywhere.</i>

199
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,522
And then out of nowhere,
this figure appears.

200
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,491
I can't, like, make it out
in any detail or anything,

201
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,561
but I just somehow know
that it's my mother.

202
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,031
And I try to swerve, but I can
<i>feel the car hit something.</i>

203
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,666
I get out,
and I look all around

204
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,569
<i>but there's no body, nothing.</i>

205
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,604
<i>Just snow and blinding
whiteness everywhere.</i>

206
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,677
I... I've been having these
dreams ever since my mom left.

207
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,378
That's not unusual,
especially given the trauma
of your situation.

208
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,684
However, contrary to popular
belief, dreams don't necessarily
mean anything.

209
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,057
We all have strange dreams.

210
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,259
But in most cases,
it's just your brain's way

211
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,627
of letting off steam
at the end of the day.

212
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,796
Oh.

213
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,134
<i>I'm worried
 about you, Kat.</i>

214
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,639
What do you mean?

215
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,808
This is too much
to deal with on your own.

216
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,311
Is that shrink
you're seeing helping any?

217
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,245
I guess. I've only been
a couple of times.

218
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,715
Yeah, well, my mom said

219
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,186
therapy helped her a lot
after my dad left.

220
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,096
I still don't understand
how she could do this to you.

221
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,465
- She wanted out, I guess.
- So? That's no excuse.

222
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,202
Least my dad told us
he was leaving.

223
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,440
He didn't just leave us
in the dark, wondering.

224
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,346
Whatever. Can we just
stop talking and fuck?

225
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,386
Gotta get back
before my mom freaks out.

226
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,655
Plus isn't your dad
coming home soon?

227
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,124
No, not for
at least an hour.

228
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,727
Yeah, well, last thing I want
is for him to catch us again.

229
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,362
Last time he got so mad I
thought he was gonna kill me.

230
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,232
Just, give your shrink
a chance, will you?

231
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,271
All right.

232
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,674
Seriously. You need to
let some of your anger out.

233
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,141
You're gonna crack.
Just like your mom.

234
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,947
It's like a vicious circus.

235
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,284
Catch you later.

236
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,860
I don't mean to sound crass,
but if I don't get some dick
soon I'm going to explode.

237
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,766
Join the fucking club,
sister.

238
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,535
Look on the bright side.
At least you've had real sex.

239
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,473
I'm so paranoid about AIDS
I have to live vicariously
through you.

240
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,742
Okay, well, the problem is that
once you've had real sex,

241
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,578
it's, like, all
you can ever think about.

242
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,078
And Phil barely even touches me
anymore. He, like, gives me
goodnight peck and that's it.

243
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,383
What? That's fucked up.

244
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,486
I know. It's, like,
we're some old married couple.

245
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,355
Maybe you should bang that hot
detective you're so into.

246
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,592
What? What are you talking
about? He's, like, 40.

247
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,827
That's not even legal
I don't think.

248
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,798
Kat, he's a cop. If anyone knows
how to do shit without getting
caught, he does.

249
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,567
Yeah, plus you'll be 18
in a few weeks anyway.

250
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:13,705
Okay, whatever.  I am
not screwing a 40 year old cop.

251
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:13,872
Okay?
  Back to the problem at hand, getting Phil to fuck me.

252
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,711
Well, have you talked
to him about it?

253
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,945
I tried. All he says is that,
uh, he's got a lot on his mind,

254
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,619
and that I need
to cut him some slacks.

255
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,555
Oh my god,
what a fucking moron!

256
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,992
I know. I know Phil's not the
brightest crayon in the box.

257
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,462
That is the understatement
of the century.

258
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,631
That's what I kind of like
about him, you know?

259
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,301
It's just simple.

260
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,437
I know that sounds perverse,
but he's kind of like my dad
in that way.

261
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,205
You can scratch the surface
and there's just more surface.

262
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,746
I'm gonna get straight Cs!

263
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,949
Show me.

264
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,791
My god,
you're so fuckin' crazy!

265
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,031
Phil is literally
 the boy next door.

266
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,232
<i>And when he and his
 mother moved in last year,
 I instantly despised him.</i>

267
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,505
<i>He was so dull
 and stupid.</i>

268
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,241
I made fun of him. Even earned
<i><i><i>a special nickname: Garbage.</i>

269
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,478
<i>But then, one night that
 summer, everything changed.</i>

270
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,455
<i>Me, Beth and Mickey,
 We were doing what we did
 every Wednesday.</i>

271
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,361
<i>And even more bored
 than usual.</i>

272
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,297
Sometimes I wish someone would
burn this place to the ground

273
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,534
- so we didn't have
to come here anymore.
- Oh, tell me about it.

274
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,737
Every week it's the same
fucking people with
the same fucking songs

275
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,538
in the exact same
fucking order.

276
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,008
- Oh my god.
- What?

277
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,680
Look what the bats
dragged in.

278
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,315
What the hell
is Garbage doing here?

279
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,653
Oh, shit,
he's coming over here.

280
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,355
What a fucking freak.

281
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,891
Guys, be cool. Come on.

282
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

283
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,834
You live across
the street from me.

284
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,038
Mm-hm.

285
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,039
I'm Phil.

286
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,406
I'm Kat.

287
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,010
This is, uh,
Beth and Mickey.

288
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,915
Hey.

289
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,554
This place seems cool.

290
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,756
Mm-hm.

291
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,891
You come here a lot?

292
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,862
Sometimes.

293
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,205
Is this your
first time here?

294
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,409
Uh-huh.

295
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:10,882
I love this song.

296
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,085
Me too.

297
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,827
Hey, do you wanna dance?

298
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,030
Sure.

299
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,807
Wait, what if
your parents come home?

300
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,876
It's my mom's shopping day
and my dad's at work.

301
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,692
You sure?

302
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,896
Yeah.

303
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,042
Ow.  Sorry. Oops.

304
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,644
Okay.

305
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,654
You okay?

306
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:32,657
Yeah. Okay.

307
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,659
Oh, god.

308
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,028
And like that, in a blink,
 my virginity disappeared.

309
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:43,067
<i>Just like my mother.</i>

310
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,673
Hold on. I'm coming.

311
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,217
Good afternoon, Mrs. Hillman.

312
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,119
It's Eve Connors,
from next door.

313
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,889
Oh. Hello.

314
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,824
Do you have a moment?
May I come in?

315
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,795
Yes, of... of course.
Is... is everything all right?

316
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,729
Everything's fine.
I just thought we should
have a little chat.

317
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:15,933
Oh, please, sit.

318
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,672
Can I get you a cup of tea,
or coffee, Mrs. Connors?

319
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,145
No, no thank you.

320
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:27,845
And please, call me Eve.

321
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,048
So...

322
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,121
...what can I help
you with, Eve?

323
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,957
Well, it seems my daughter Kat
and your son are dating.

324
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,259
Yeah, I know. They're going to
some big fancy dance next week.

325
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,299
- Fall formal.
- Ah, the...
that's... that's it.

326
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,135
Phil is, he's so excited.

327
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,738
I thought it might be a good
idea for us to get acquainted,

328
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,807
so I wanted
to introduce myself, and--

329
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,776
Whoa. Whoops.

330
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,344
Phil?

331
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,079
Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was here.

332
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,413
Phil, this is Kat's mother,
Mrs. Connors.

333
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,785
Hey.

334
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,155
She just, uh, came by
to say hello.

335
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,992
Uh, okay.

336
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,129
Well, I'm just gonna
head to my room.

337
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,939
He's a nice boy.

338
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,675
You can rest assured, Eve,
that my Phil

339
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,710
will take good care
of your daughter.

340
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,712
He's rented a tux,
and everything.

341
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:37,882
Yes.

342
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,887
I'm taking Kat to the mall
this afternoon to buy
a new dress.

343
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,958
If your mother
 was so unhappy,

344
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,329
why do you think she married
your father in the first place?

345
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,066
God, I have no idea.

346
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,803
Because he was there?

347
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:02,273
<i>I mean,
 he wanted to marry her.</i>

348
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,909
<i>She had no
 other choice, maybe?</i>

349
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,245
<i>I mean, she went to college,
 and she was working
 as a receptionist,</i>

350
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,281
<i>but what else was
she gonna do?</i>

351
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,387
I guess life with my father
must have been pretty bleak
and miserable for her.

352
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,825
The night before she left
I noticed that she started
dressing different.

353
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,998
What do you mean,
different?

354
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,431
Like, her clothes
got tighter. Sexier.

355
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,739
I mean, she even bought
a miniskirt.

356
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,139
Then there was that night that
she walked in on me and Phil.

357
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,943
I think it's time
for Phil to go home.

358
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,214
- What? Why?
- It's late.

359
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,017
It's not even midnight.

360
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:50,821
Kat, what I say goes.
And I say go to bed.

361
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:51,022
The weirdest part was thatshe had on this nightgown that
 was practically see-through.

362
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,095
<i>It was almost like
 she was putting on a show.</i>

363
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,331
Could it be that's
what she was doing?

364
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,000
What? Putting on a show?

365
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,702
For me, or for Phil?

366
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,872
No.

367
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,343
I think she was just bored.

368
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:16,480
And getting older, and trying
to get whatever attention
she could.

369
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,452
It was almost like
she wanted to have
an affair or something.

370
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,256
Do you think that's
what was going on?

371
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,228
No. I mean,
I can't imagine it.

372
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:31,929
But, I guess anything's
possible, right?

373
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:35,466
Oh. Sorry.

374
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,236
I tried knocking
but there was no answer.

375
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,206
That's all right. Could I help
you with something?

376
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:46,610
I'm just looking
for my mom's stupid cat.

377
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,148
You seen him?

378
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,283
Can't say that I have.

379
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,190
Oh. Okay. Sorry to
bother you, Mrs. Connors.

380
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,025
Mrs. Connors sounds
so formal. Call me Eve.

381
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,231
Oh. All right.

382
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,167
You know, the time when
I was your age doesn't seem
so far away.

383
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,071
Well, I should probably
look for my mom's cat.

384
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,344
Phil, would you like to have
dinner with us tonight?

385
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:24,949
I'm making crab thermador.

386
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,219
Uh, sure.

387
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,056
Dinner is at seven.

388
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,327
Cool. Thanks, Mrs. Connor.
I mean...

389
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,530
...Eve.

390
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,985
Uh, yeah, you've reached
<i>Detective Theo Scieziesciez.</i>

391
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,987
<i>Leave a message
 after the beep.</i>

392
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:08,426
Hi. Um, Detective.
It's, uh, it's Kat Connors.

393
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,461
I'm just... I'm just
calling because I think

394
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:10,694
I might have
some information

395
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,467
about my mother. Uh...

396
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:06,050
Hey. Thanks again
for meeting me here.

397
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,319
Couldn't bear the thought
of going into the office
on my day off, you know?

398
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,120
No problem.

399
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,989
Come on in.

400
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,057
Thank you.

401
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,694
It ain't fancy,
but it's home.

402
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,101
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

403
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,370
I'd offer you a beer,
but you're not of age.

404
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,572
I'd take one anyway.

405
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,508
All right then.

406
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,547
Sit down.

407
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,569
- Go on.
- Thanks.

408
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,476
So? What do you want
to talk to me about?

409
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,679
I, um...

410
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:11,415
I... I called because
I have some new information.

411
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,255
I just remembered
some things, and,

412
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,691
I think my mother may
have been having an affair.

413
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,359
Oh, yeah?

414
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,861
I mean, it could explain
why she left, right?

415
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,564
Maybe. I'll look
into it on Monday.

416
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,102
Okay.

417
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,210
Is that it?

418
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,347
I just thought that it might be,
like, relative to the case.

419
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,222
Are you nervous?

420
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,624
I guess.
A little.

421
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,565
Well, you know you can leave
any time you want, right?

422
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,400
I know.

423
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,302
But, uh, you don't want
to leave, do you?

424
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,477
Because you came here
to seduce me.

425
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,381
Well, congratulations,
sweetheart. It worked.

426
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,753
I'm seduced.

427
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,790
And how old are you?

428
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,294
Eighteen.

429
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,730
You're not a virgin,
are you?

430
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:33,030
No.

431
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,300
So, uh...

432
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,806
...you know what's about
to happen, right?

433
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,609
And are you sure
that's what you want?

434
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,314
Because I'm not one of your
punk classmates from school,
you know?

435
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,285
I know.

436
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,064
Well, you're hot,
that's for sure.

437
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,534
Your tits are perfect.

438
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,738
But you already know that,
don't you.

439
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,081
Maybe I should come over
there and join you.

440
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,284
Yeah.

441
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,732
This better?

442
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,333
Mm-hm.

443
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,482
Why don't you take
this top off, huh?

444
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,709
Fucking amazing.

445
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,186
Is this what you want?

446
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,521
Yeah.

447
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,446
- Hey.
- Hey.

448
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,352
Everything all right?

449
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:08,785
Yeah. I just don't sleep
so good sometime.

450
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,389
I've seen a lot
of bad shit.

451
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,726
Dead people.

452
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,630
Very unhappy about it.

453
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,698
Oh yeah?

454
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,333
Yeah.

455
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,902
Trust me,
you don't wanna know.

456
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,505
Try me.

457
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,775
All right.

458
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,580
Once there was
this obese man,

459
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,887
some sick fuck had doused him
with gasoline

460
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,927
and lit him on fire.

461
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,328
And by the time
we got to the body,

462
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,032
two days later,

463
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,502
he was still burning.

464
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,772
What?

465
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,440
Guy had so much body fat,

466
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,477
he was like
a human candle.

467
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,422
And there's
one thing I've learned,

468
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,357
in all my years as a cop,

469
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,294
it's that people are capable
of doing horrible,

470
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,636
unimaginable things
to each other.

471
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,677
Love how slippery you are.

472
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,746
Feel like I could break you
in half.

473
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,748
I'm tougher
than I look.

474
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,583
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

475
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,919
- Wanna try me?
- Yes.

476
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,322
Oh, my god.

477
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,391
What? It was easy.

478
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,426
What do you mean
it was easy?

479
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,696
I mean I went over there
and I fucked him.

480
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,466
Wow. I'm impressed.

481
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,669
Truly, truly impressed.
So was it hot?

482
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,639
Oh, hell yes.
Like, so much better than Phil.

483
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,706
Deets, girl, deets.

484
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,342
He's just, like, so manly.

485
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:12,476
Like, cock, and balls,
and, like, hairy chest,
and muscles, and,

486
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,081
like, the way he smells,
Beth, is so intense.
It's, like, primal.

487
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,818
Oh, I can still
smell him on me now.

488
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,923
I'mma have me some.

489
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,592
Oh, god, that's so hot.

490
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,429
One day I hope some musky macho
stud will fuck the shit out
of me too.

491
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,463
- Oh, it'll happen.
- Oh, yeah. When? When?

492
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,503
I'm so proud of you.

493
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,606
Why? Because I fucked
an old guy?

494
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,074
Yeah.

495
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,643
I mean, don't take this
the wrong way, Kat,

496
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,813
but for the longest time
you were acting like
you were still fat.

497
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,648
Oh my god.
What are you talking about?

498
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,084
I mean, you lost all
of that weight, like,

499
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,086
what, three years ago?

500
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,022
But you're still skulking
around all angsty and awkward.

501
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:02,392
Like a fat chick. Like me.

502
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:02,659
And Mickey, who's basically
a fat chick in a skinny
gay body.

503
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,668
- You're crazy.
- It's true.

504
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,938
<i>Mr.Connor, this is Sheryl from thenLoma Linda Police Department.</i>

505
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,709
<i>I'm pleased to inform you
 that you passed your lie
detector test.</i>

506
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,209
<i>Thank you for your
cooperation, and have
 a nice day.</i>

507
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,684
Why would your dad need
to take a lie detector test?

508
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,753
I have no idea.

509
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:32,122
Well, do you think the cops
think he knows something?

510
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,092
My dad? Beth,
have you met him?

511
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:38,628
You look up clueless
in the dictionary and there's
a picture of him.

512
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,864
Must be some kind of mistake.

513
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,966
Probably.

514
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,201
I think that's his car.
Just ask him.

515
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,674
- Do you want me to leave?
- What? No. Whatever.

516
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,975
I'm sure it's nothing.

517
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,646
Hi, sweetheart, Beth.

518
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,017
Kids didn't spend too much money
at the mall, I hope?

519
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,018
Nope. I just picked up
a few things.

520
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,888
Hey, dad, there was a,
uh, message for you,

521
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,759
on the machine,
from the police department.

522
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,031
Is there news
about your mother?

523
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,198
No. They said that you passed
the lie detector test?

524
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,705
Oh. Well, whoop-dee-do.

525
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,640
So, you going to join us
for dinner, Beth?

526
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,842
I... I don't think so,
Mr. Connors.

527
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,844
Hm.

528
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,013
Dad, why would they want you
to take a lie detector test?

529
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,982
Beats me. It's standard
procedure in cases
like this, I guess.

530
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,719
So what are you feeling,
sweetheart?

531
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,924
Should we order takeout
from that rib place?

532
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,993
Yeah, sure.

533
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:54,271
Mom?

534
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,874
What is it?
What's going on?

535
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,112
Is Phil a good fuck?

536
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,982
Go to bed, mom.

537
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,020
Don't you turn
your back on me!

538
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,589
Seriously,
just go back to bed.

539
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,158
I will not be dismissed
by the likes of you.

540
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,094
- Answer me!
- Ow!

541
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,262
Is Phil a good fuck?

542
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,931
What would you know
about fucking, anyway?

543
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,534
Oh my...
what are you doing?

544
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,004
What is this?

545
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,773
- Mom, what are you--
- Why are you naked?

546
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,143
I was hot! Jesus!
Get out of my room!

547
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,778
Why are you doing this?

548
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,612
What did I ever do
to you? Stop!

549
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,316
I do too know what
a good fuck is.

550
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,320
You little slut.

551
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,224
What is your problem?

552
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:55,232
Are you insane?
What is fucking wrong with you?

553
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,041
<i>What kind of mothernwould do something like that?</i>

554
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,311
My mother.

555
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,948
What? What?
That's just how she was.

556
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:20,257
I mean, everyone has
a crappy childhood.
It's not like she beat me.

557
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:24,694
So my mom wasn't
Hallmark Card perfect.
So fucking what?

558
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,001
I just think
she was lonely.

559
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,373
I used to catch her
staring at me,

560
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:39,075
like I was wearing something
that I had stolen from her.

561
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,846
You look like I looked
when I was you.

562
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,917
What?

563
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:47,584
I mean, you look like
I looked when I was your age.

564
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,422
Whatever, lurker.

565
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,892
What? What do you want?

566
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,030
Nothing.

567
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,732
Oh my god, stop gawking at me.
You're creeping me out.

568
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,806
Just, like, get out of here.
Just leave me alone.

569
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,284
About a week
before she disappeared,

570
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,519
Phil and I were in the basement
doing homework,

571
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,289
just like any
other ordinary night.

572
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,131
Well, what
do you think? You like?

573
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,068
Pretty sexy for 42, huh?

574
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,703
Mom, what are you doing?

575
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:43,139
Oh, loosen up,
Miss Prissypants.

576
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,207
Phil. Why don't you and your
mother join us for dinner?

577
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,214
I'm making my world-famous
Beef Wellington.

578
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:51,948
Uh, yeah, o...
okay, Mrs. Connors. I'll ask.

579
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:55,485
Splendid.

580
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,122
I'm in the mood
to celebrating.

581
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,727
Okay, mom, whatever.
We get it already.

582
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,731
Oh, what's the matter, Kat?

583
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:08,698
Can't stand seeing your mother
have a little fun for a change?

584
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,738
Honey, I'm home!

585
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:15,472
Oh, and the party is over
before it's even begun.

586
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,311
Sweetheart, where are you?

587
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:23,046
There you are.
What's for dinner?

588
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,950
What's going on?
Why are you dressed like that?

589
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,087
What? You don't like it?

590
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,023
No. I don't.

591
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,959
Well, tough shit.
You don't like this skirt?

592
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,994
- Eve, stop it.
- I don't care.

593
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,330
You don't like
this skirt and I don't care.

594
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:44,334
You don't like this skirt
and I don't...
Get your goddamned hands off me!

595
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,336
I'll wear whatever the hell
I want. Whenever I want to!

596
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:51,775
What are you doing?

597
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,377
What I do every fucking night
of my fucking life,

598
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,880
making your fucking dinner.

599
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:03,453
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, shit!
What reeks?

600
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:06,022
The meat. It's all rotten.

601
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,490
Must have come unplugged.

602
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,793
Don't just stand there,
plug it back in!

603
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,861
Smells like a fucking
dead body in here!

604
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,439
Well, looks like we're
going out for dinner tonight.

605
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,544
Wanna get Chinese?

606
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,212
No. I don't want
fucking Chinese.

607
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,383
Okay, then, what would make you
happy, Evie? What do you want?

608
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,988
I don't want this.

609
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,461
I don't want any of it.

610
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:44,928
You, this house.

611
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,566
Evie.

612
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,634
I want my fucking
life back.

613
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,472
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go to dinner.

614
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:57,707
I don't want
fucking dinner!

615
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:05,148
Why won't anyone
listen to me?

616
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,046
So out of the blue
 she was just, like, poof?

617
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,252
<i>Pretty much.</i>

618
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,186
Wow.

619
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,558
You told me your mom left,
but not like that.

620
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,996
Well, we've been roommates
for almost a year, so.

621
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,365
But don't you wonder where
she is? I mean, she's gotta
be somewhere, right?

622
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,034
I don't know, it's weird.

623
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,470
Hardly even think
about her anymore.

624
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,204
You know, it's, like, so much
time has passed, that kinda
just gotten used to it.

625
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,644
Guess going home next week
for break

626
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,981
has kinda resurrected
the ghost from my past.

627
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:15,251
Speaking of ghosts, you're not
gonna go see that loser
boyfriend of yours,

628
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,619
- what's-his-name, are you?
- You mean Phil?

629
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,923
Maybe. Why?

630
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,361
Well, you know
I'm team Oliver.

631
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,497
We've only been dating
for a couple of months.

632
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,966
So? That's enough to know
that he's hot, and smart,

633
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,036
and actually has a future,
unlike what's-his-name.

634
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:36,206
Cindy, you met Phil once,
for a weekend.

635
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,508
Yeah, that was enough.

636
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,376
Whatever.
The future bores me.

637
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,380
What's going on with you
tonight? Is everything okay?

638
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,385
Yeah, why?

639
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:52,088
I don't know, you seem
a million miles away.

640
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,423
Sorry.
Just a little preoccupied.

641
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,528
I'm fine.

642
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,266
What?

643
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:04,934
Nothing.

644
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,539
Don't say nothing
when it's something.

645
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,574
Okay, you know I don't
like it when you smoke.

646
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,277
It's bad for you, especially
since you're on the pill.

647
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:17,614
Yeah, well, this is only my
second one today. I'm cutting
back, just for you.

648
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:21,718
Don't cut back for me. Okay?
It's your health
we're talking about.

649
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,524
Okay, doctor.

650
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,325
Are you satisfied?

651
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:32,695
Not if you're
gonna be mad.

652
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,998
Why would I be mad? Hm?

653
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,267
Just because you're
telling me what to do?

654
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:39,335
I mean, I can't smoke
in my room because Cindy
says it stinks,

655
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,638
and I can't smoke around
you because you say it's
unhealthy.

656
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,307
Kat, it's not like you're
addicted to nicotine. You've
been smoking for two months.

657
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:47,544
Okay, well, whatever.
I just want to be free
to do what I want.

658
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,712
Okay, find,
go ahead and smoke.

659
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,681
I don't want to fight.

660
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,222
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

661
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,157
I just...
I want you to be happy.

662
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,026
- I think I'm just
gonna head home.
- Wait. What?

663
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:08,031
I'm going.
I have studying to do.

664
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,400
Kat, come on. What are...
what are you doing? Just stay.

665
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,402
Goodnight, Oliver.

666
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,504
Oh my god, what is the matter
with you? Seriously?

667
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:17,907
What did I do?
Kat? Kat!

668
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,182
Hey! Hi, dad.

669
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:00,316
Wow.

670
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,685
What?

671
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,554
I can't believe
how grown up you look.

672
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,690
Oh, god. Can we forego
the theatrics, please?

673
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,494
Whatever. Act as jaded as you
want, I missed my little girl

674
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,663
- and I'm not ashamed
to say so.

675
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:16,132
So how is Berkeley? Thanks
for all the letters, by the way.

676
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,801
- Oh, sorry.
Been studying my ass off.
- I know, I know.

677
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,570
You're a big city girl now.
No time for your poor old dad.

678
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,307
I'm glad you're home,
sweetheart.

679
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:28,144
Yeah.

680
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:31,648
Uh, sh...
should we?

681
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:36,452
Yes. No, I got it.
I got it. Ugh.

682
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,354
- Thank you.
- Here.

683
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,189
So, anything new
and exciting around here?

684
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,190
Oh, not really.
Pretty much the same old, same
old.

685
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,728
What?

686
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,430
Dad?

687
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,733
Dad, what is it?
Why are you acting all weird?

688
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,204
Well, I do have
a bit of news.

689
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,273
Is everything okay?

690
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,842
Everything's fine.
I just, um...

691
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,512
Oh my god, just spit
it out already.

692
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:02,712
I've been seeing someone.

693
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,449
Really? Yes. Does it
make you angry?

694
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,255
What? Are you kidding me?
No, dad, mom's been gone
a long time.

695
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,890
Why shouldn't you
see other women?

696
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,625
Well, good.

697
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,662
So, what's her name?

698
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,431
- May.
- May?

699
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:23,633
She's a sales rep
I met at the office.

700
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,769
Dad, that's so great.

701
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,705
Seriously,
I'm really happy for you.

702
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,405
Thank you, sweetheart.
That means a lot to me.

703
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,309
So, what are your plans
while you're at home?

704
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,680
Uh, I have
some studying to do,

705
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,551
but mostly
I just wanna relax,

706
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:45,555
see some old friends.
You know, the usual.

707
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:49,559
Wow. Welcome back,
stranger.

708
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,596
Such a fucking rebel.

709
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,667
Kat, you're my new idol.

710
00:53:57,668 --> 00:54:02,238
Oh my god
I've missed you guys.

711
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,808
I mean, my friends at Berkley
are nice and everything,
but just kind of boring.

712
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,311
Oh, I missed you too.

713
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:11,380
What I haven't missed
is this shitty little
pisshole of a town.

714
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,683
Oh my god, my mom told me
to clean my room this morning.

715
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,752
I almost bludgeoned her
to death.

716
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:19,322
- Ugh, I can't believe
we ever lived here.
- Oh, I know.

717
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:22,258
Though I kind of find it
reassuring that this place
never changes.

718
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,961
You know? It's like
it's frozen in time.

719
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,462
- Ew.
- Hm.

720
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:30,500
And you think
you've changed?

721
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,802
Oh, yeah. I'd say so.

722
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:36,205
I mean, I definitely feel more
comfortable in my own skin.

723
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,007
- School's going well?
- Mm-hm.

724
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,809
And I assume you haven't heard
from your mother.

725
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,581
Nope. Not a word.

726
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,684
How are you feeling about that?
It's been over two years.

727
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,853
I... I don't know.

728
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,623
It's... it's kind of gotten
to the point where

729
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,459
I just don't even expect
to hear from her anymore.

730
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,226
I've just come to this weird
sort of acceptance of it.

731
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,932
Guess I've just moved on.

732
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:03,633
I mean, even my dad
has himself a new girlfriend.

733
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,639
Does that bother
you at all?

734
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,375
Hm-mm. Why should it?

735
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,411
My mother's gone.
She's never coming back.

736
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:31,861
Hey.

737
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,031
Hey.

738
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,401
How're you doing?
You look great.

739
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,838
Thank you. You too.

740
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,709
Hey, Aaron, okay if
I grab a smoke break?

741
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,080
Make it quick. We got
a fuckload of work to do.

742
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,283
Come on.

743
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,990
So school's going good?

744
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,258
It's all right. How about you?
How've you been?

745
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,062
You know, work, taking care
of my mom.

746
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,935
Same old, same old.

747
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,937
- How is she?
- My mom?

748
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,973
Yeah.

749
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,975
Batshit crazy as ever.

750
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,483
Can I have one?

751
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,985
Sure. You're smoking now?

752
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,858
Sometimes. Thanks.

753
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,071
When'd you get back
into town?

754
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,874
Um, couple of days ago.

755
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,943
I'm sorry, I...
I would have called sooner.

756
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:54,443
Just been
really busy, and...

757
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,880
Whatever. It's cool.

758
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:09,592
But, uh, we should, we should
hang out while I'm here.

759
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,961
Catch a movie
or something?

760
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:12,695
Yeah. Sounds good.

761
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:16,132
Here 'til Thursday.

762
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,902
Cool.

763
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:28,577
You don't have to,
you know.

764
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,582
Have to what?

765
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,151
See me.

766
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:41,490
I mean, I know you might
not have time for
an asshole like me,

767
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,927
<i>ow that you're a hot
shit college student.</i>

768
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,763
Phil, what are you
talking about?

769
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,433
Of course
I want to see you.

770
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:52,001
Right, whatever.

771
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:58,407
I better get back to work
before my boss has a cow.

772
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,675
Yeah.

773
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,021
I am so sorry that I'm late.
Traffic was ridiculous.

774
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,194
No problem, sweetheart.

775
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:21,063
Kat, this is May.
May, Kat.

776
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,432
I'm so happy we finally
get the chance to meet.

777
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,667
I've heard
so much about you.

778
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:28,037
Oh, me too.

779
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:30,673
And you're even lovelier
than your father described.

780
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,676
Oh.
 I'm sure that's not true, but thank you anyway.

781
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,945
So how long will you be
in town, Katrina?

782
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:39,849
Oh, just a week. Then it's back
to the salt mines.

783
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,084
Kat got almost all
"A"s her first semester.

784
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,453
Wow, congratulations.

785
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,124
Yeah. I lucked out. Have you
guys ordered yet? I'm starved.

786
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,693
Your favorite, the spinach
artichoke appetizer. It's
already on its way.

787
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,528
Oh, yes.

788
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,530
I'm going to make a quick trip
to the ladies room.

789
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,632
If the waiter comes,
you know what I want.

790
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,300
Right, okay.

791
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:07,510
So, uh, are you
all right with this?

792
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,050
What? You mean May?

793
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,153
Yeah, Dad I like her.
She seems sweet.

794
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:19,155
I just don't want it
to be awkward for you.

795
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:21,891
Dad, I told you I am thrilled
that you met someone.

796
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,293
Seriously,
you deserve to be happy.

797
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,467
Took off your
wedding ring.

798
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:38,207
It makes May
uncomfortable.

799
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,510
I put it back on
when she's not around.

800
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,113
Why bother?
I mean, mom left us.

801
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:47,616
She's the one who made
that choice. I accept that now.

802
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,719
It's about time
we get on with our lives.

803
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,334
Mom?

804
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,773
Kat.

805
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,708
What is it? What's wrong?

806
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,711
I put my hands in the water,
and they disappeared.

807
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:18,914
What?

808
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,318
I was doing the dishes
and the water was so cold.

809
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:29,992
There was a spoon
at the bottom of the sink,

810
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:35,097
and when I lifted
my hands out of the water...

811
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:49,778
What's the matter?

812
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,012
Um, nothing.

813
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,782
Just have strange
dreams sometimes.

814
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,954
Oh yeah?

815
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,392
Yeah.

816
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,894
They started
after my mother disappeared.

817
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:10,533
Used to get them all the time.
It's actually the first one
I've had in weeks.

818
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,236
Hardly ever talk
about your mother.

819
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,174
There's not much to say.
She's gone.

820
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,944
The shrink says
dreams are meaningless.

821
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,615
I don't think
I agree with that.

822
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:30,986
What do you think
my dreams mean?

823
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,834
You really want my opinion?

824
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,870
Of course.
Why wouldn't I?

825
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:57,046
As you know,
we did an exhaustive search
for your mother.

826
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,349
Exhaustive? You guys barely
even looked for her.

827
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,086
Actually, a very thorough
investigation was done.

828
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,755
We spent over two years
looking for your mom.

829
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,825
Not a single trace
was ever found.

830
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,160
Mm-hm. Whatever.

831
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,797
So where do you
think she is?

832
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,937
I think she's dead.

833
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:25,140
What?

834
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,044
Well, you said yourself
she was having an affair,
which we confirmed.

835
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:35,417
With your neighbor,
Mrs. Blangman?

836
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,354
Mrs. Hillman.

837
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,521
Whatever. She said your mom
had a boyfriend.

838
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:42,958
How would she know?

839
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,227
She's nosy.

840
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,931
She can't see.

841
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:56,238
Wait... whatever. Even if
my mom did have a boyfriend,

842
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,009
doesn't it just make it
that much more likely that
she just ran off somewhere?

843
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:08,250
- What?
- Ah...

844
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:08,984
What? What is it?
What aren't you saying?

845
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,988
We did a thorough background
check on your father.

846
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:19,361
Several interviewees told us

847
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:19,662
that he was a pretty jealous
and volatile man.

848
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,168
My dad is a fucking wimp.

849
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,270
That's why he used
to drive my mom crazy.

850
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,939
Not according to Bob
and Margie Carlsen.

851
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,142
- Who are they?
- Your former neighbors.

852
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,278
Your parents used to live next
door to them in Riverside.

853
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,948
They told us that when your
father suspected your mother

854
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,351
had a thing
for Bob Carlsen,

855
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:45,020
he lit a trash can on fire

856
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:45,754
and he tossed it
onto their patio.

857
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,325
That's ridiculous.

858
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:54,363
Never even heard
of these people,
and that was two decades ago.

859
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,470
Fine, if my dad was so
dangerous, then why didn't
you ever arrest him?

860
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,410
No evidence.

861
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,814
We didn't even have sufficient
cause for a search warrant.

862
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:12,448
Asked for my professional
opinion, and I told you.

863
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:19,388
Kat, that's just
what I think.

864
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,889
Which is?

865
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,160
I think you father caught
your mother fucking her
boyfriend and he killed her.

866
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,931
Well then what
did he do with the body?

867
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,069
That's a damn mystery.

868
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:49,852
Kat. Come on.

869
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,990
Where are you going?

870
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,092
You know what I think,
Detective?

871
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,260
I think you're
full of shit.

872
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:20,249
Come on, strong man.
You can do better than that.

873
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,418
What, like this?

874
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,487
No. Harder.

875
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,559
Put those muscles to good used
for a change. That's better.

876
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,696
That's it. Come on,
give it a whack.

877
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:42,471
You're already here?

878
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:43,705
Uh, yeah. I was just helping
your mom with dinner.

879
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,144
Unlike some people.

880
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:05,727
Hi, Mrs. Hillman. It's Kat.
I'm sorry, were you in bed?

881
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:13,001
Oh, oh no. I...
I was just lying down.

882
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,971
I... I haven't been
feeling well.

883
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,907
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to bother
you. But, uh, is Phil here?

884
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,109
No. He isn't.

885
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,079
- Do you know where he is?
- I'm afraid not.

886
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,482
That boy sometimes goes out
gallivanting

887
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,985
'til all hours of the night.

888
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,120
Okay, well, could you please
tell him to call me as soon
as he gets home?

889
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:35,190
- It's kind of important.
- Uh... of course.

890
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,626
Thank you. Sorry again
for bothering you.

891
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:38,927
Oh, it's... it's no problem.
Goodnight, dear.

892
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:43,765
Good night.

893
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,988
I don't think it's right
with her here.

894
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,990
But if Kat says she's
comfortable, I don't--

895
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:08,156
I don't care
what Kat said.

896
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,326
Dad?

897
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,398
Honey? Aww, I'm sorry.

898
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,433
I didn't mean
to wake you.

899
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,702
If you two are arguing
over whether or not

900
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,705
May can sleep over,
it's totally fine.

901
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,407
Sweetheart, I don't think--

902
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,043
No, no, no, dad, seriously.
I don't mind.

903
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,146
Well, you're sick,
and we have to get you
to the airport tomorrow.

904
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:31,747
I'm almost better. My flight's
not until the afternoon.

905
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,121
You know what, this is
my house and I call
the shots around here.

906
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,096
Sorry, Kat.

907
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,799
I didn't mean for you
to get dragged into this.

908
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,641
To Phil, may he rest
in pieces.

909
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:00,275
Oh my god.

910
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,012
No, fuck Phil.
Seriously, fuck him.

911
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,351
The jerk never
even called me back.

912
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,220
That's the spirit.
Fuck Phil.

913
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,656
Or, rather, don't fuck Phil.
Stop fucking Phil.

914
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,391
Yeah. Oh!

915
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,727
Fuck that hot
stud cop instead.

916
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:18,994
Done and done.

917
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,131
You know, he said something
kind of weird the other night.

918
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,101
What'd he say? "I'm gonna
plow you 'til you can't
walk straight"?

919
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:31,840
No. Um,
yeah, it was so...

920
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:40,449
He said that he thinks
my dad killed my mother.

921
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,488
What?

922
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,626
What?

923
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,361
I... I told you that, Kat.
Ages ago.

924
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,333
We both did.

925
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,736
What are you
talking about?

926
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:01,503
It was right after your mom
disappeared, and you just didn't
seem to want to hear it.

927
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:10,078
Remember? I asked if maybe
your dad had something to hide?

928
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,282
You just blew it off. You said
he was too transparent
to hide anything.

929
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:21,256
You guys
are fucking crazy.

930
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:26,128
Yeah. Forget it.

931
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:28,497
We both watch
way too much bad TV.

932
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,398
But that's why
you love us, right?

933
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,668
Ugh. God,

934
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,773
there's nothing more disgusting
than warm, flat champagne.

935
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,875
- Here, give me that.
- What?

936
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,176
The bottle, please.

937
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,613
What are you doing?

938
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:48,383
It's a trick
I learned at school.

939
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,752
You put the bottle in
the freezer for a few minutes,

940
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:54,589
and it is chilled to perfection.
Come and help me.

941
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:07,135
- Mickey?
- There's no way
that I am moving

942
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,572
a bunch of old, moldy
newspapers. Fuck that.

943
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:11,306
Get your skinny gay ass
over here.

944
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:14,476
Unh.

945
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,413
Get that one.

946
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,723
It's stuck.

947
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,424
What the--

948
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,493
Why would you lock
a fucking freezer?

949
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:37,432
What the hell is going
on down here?

950
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:40,969
Nothing. We're just talking,
and drinking champagne.

951
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,342
Well, it's time
for your friends to leave.

952
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,178
What are you talking about?

953
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,214
You heard me, Kat.
The party is over.

954
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:54,583
Are you joking?

955
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:57,285
Dad, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm a fuckin' adult.

956
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,321
You can't tell me
what to do.

957
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:01,623
When you're under my roof,
you will do as I say.

958
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,960
And I'm saying your friends
need to go home, now.

959
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:06,762
Oh my god.
What is your problem?

960
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,597
Cool it.
It's... it's okay, Kat.

961
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,665
- Yeah. Don't worry about it.
- No...

962
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,901
Goodnight, Mr. Connors.

963
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,970
Wait, I'll walk
you guys out.

964
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:32,888
Thank you for completely
humiliating me in front
of my friends.

965
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,423
So fucking glad I'm
getting out of here tomorrow.

966
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:42,931
Sorry my dad is being
such a douche.

967
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,567
Whatever. I gotta fly out
early tomorrow anyway.

968
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:47,335
Me too, and I'm not
even packed yet.

969
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,638
Sure you're okay to drive?

970
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,907
Unlike you lightweights,
I can handle my liquor.

971
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:56,812
God, I'm gonna
miss you guys.

972
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,447
Oh my god, drama queen.

973
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,250
It'll be summer soon, and we'll
be back in this rancid hellhole

974
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,252
for three freakin' months.

975
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,490
I know.

976
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,525
Yeah, well, take care.
Don't forget to write.

977
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,528
Yeah. You too, shithead.

978
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,598
- Bye, Kat. Have a safe
flight, all right?
- You too.

979
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,610
Hey.

980
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,414
Hey.

981
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,951
Are you all right?
You look drunk.

982
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,622
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talking.

983
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:17,659
So you've been avoiding me
on purpose, or what?

984
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,763
- What do you mean?
- I came by your house
last week.

985
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,103
Told your mother
that I needed to talk to you.

986
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:30,171
Really?
I didn't get the message.

987
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,975
What did you want
to talk to me about?

988
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:38,046
Just been thinking
about a lot of things.

989
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,817
You know, I feel like
after my mother left,

990
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,523
everything changed
between us.

991
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,625
We were different.
You were different.

992
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,362
Everything was different
after that.

993
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,967
Phil, where were you that day?
You were supposed to
pick me up from school.

994
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,637
I told you.
I was at Thomas'.

995
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,575
My god, don't you get it?

996
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,414
It doesn't matter anymore.
You don't have to lie.

997
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:15,517
What do you mean? What makes
you think that I'm lying?

998
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:17,886
Okay, I'm not
accusing you of lying.

999
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:21,589
All I'm saying is
whatever it is that you know,
you can just tell me.

1000
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,167
You know what? What we had
was sweet, and cute,
and great and everything,

1001
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:35,637
but I think we both know
that it's over.

1002
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:35,770
It's in the past,
and I need to know what
happened that day

1003
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,543
so that I can move on
with my life.

1004
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:43,878
Please, Phil, I'm not gonna get
mad at you. I just want to know.

1005
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,615
I told you.
I don't know anything.

1006
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,954
Was there something going on
between you and my mother?

1007
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:58,693
- What?
- You heard me.

1008
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:03,498
Were you fucking my mom? Because
some people think that you were.

1009
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,066
What... what...
what people?

1010
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:05,400
Kat, you're... you're drunk.
And crazy.

1011
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:13,174
Phil, I just need to know!
Please, I don't care what it is.

1012
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:18,079
I just cannot keep living
my life in the dark just,
like, fucking wondering!

1013
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,585
I can't help you, Kat.

1014
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:31,059
I'm sorry.

1015
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,007
But I will tell you
one thing.

1016
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,644
Your dad knows
where she is.

1017
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:54,616
He's been keeping her
up his sleeve this whole time.

1018
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,086
What do you mean?

1019
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,556
Don't ask me. Ask him.

1020
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:05,487
Kat! Kat!

1021
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:09,524
I'm up here!

1022
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,794
Over here!

1023
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:15,830
No! This way!

1024
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:20,902
Yes!
Right in front of you!

1025
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,339
I'm right here, Kat.

1026
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,914
Help me!

1027
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:35,984
Please! Help me, Kat!

1028
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:40,989
Help me!

1029
01:19:58,494 --> 01:19:58,793
Kat!

1030
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:02,230
What are you doing?

1031
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:09,604
Dad?

1032
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:13,207
Do you know
where mom is?

1033
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,191
What?

1034
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:30,692
Do you know where mom is?

1035
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:34,362
Because Phil says
that you do.

1036
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,867
Phil? Your stoner boyfriend
who can't keep a job?

1037
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:57,452
The answer
is no, I don't.

1038
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,295
Anything else?

1039
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:23,211
Well, clean up this mess.
We have to get you to
the airport in a few hours.

1040
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,885
Dad?

1041
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:36,557
I'm sorry.

1042
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,130
It's all right.

1043
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:26,107
So make sure to call so I know
that you landed all right.

1044
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:29,877
Okay.

1045
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,581
So see you
in a couple of months?

1046
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,986
Mm-hm.

1047
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,237
I love you, baby.

1048
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:05,012
I love you too.

1049
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:14,722
I should probably board.

1050
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,263
See you.

1051
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:31,038
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1052
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:08,743
<i>That was the last
time I saw my father.</i>

1053
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:12,079
<i>It turns out Beth, Mickey
 and Theo were right.</i>

1054
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,580
<i>A few weeks after I left,
 my dad got shitfaced drunk
 in a bar,</i>

1055
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:17,184
<i>and confessed
to killing my mother.</i>

1056
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,188
<i>He hung himselfnin his jail cell with a sheet.</i>

1057
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:25,660
<i>Before he died, he revealed
 that my mother's body was
 in the freezer,</i>

1058
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:34,068
<i>and that he'd taken it
 out during the night while
 I was sleeping.</i>

1059
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:34,235
<i>He buried her up in
 the mountains. Since it'd
 been frozen for so long,</i>

1060
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,641
<i>her corpse decomposed
 freakishly fast,</i>

1061
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:43,511
<i>turning to liquid
as it melted.</i>

1062
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:47,348
<i>By the time they dug her up,
 there was basically
nothing left.</i>

1063
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:55,256
<i>I was seventeen
 when my mother disappeared.</i>

1064
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:55,389
<i>Like, one day she was there,
 cleaning, making dinner,</i>

1065
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:02,430
<i>and the next...
she was gone.</i>

1066
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,410
Stop it.

1067
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,254
Evie, stop.

1068
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:40,528
Evie.

1069
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,129
Stop.

1070
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,573
Please.

1071
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,910
Evie.

1072
01:26:57,913 --> 01:26:59,580
Stop!

1073
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,320
Stop.

1074
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:28,576
I love you.

1075
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:38,352
I love you.

1076
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:42,323
Because I never saw
 my mother again,

1077
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:47,828
<i>she remains
 in absence to me.</i>

1078
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:50,464
<i>An empty space.</i>

1079
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:51,766
<i>An invisible,
half remembered ghost.</i>

1080
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,736
<i>So even now I catch
 myself thinking</i>

1081
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,908
<i>that I'm gonna run
 into her some day.</i>

1082
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:04,378
<i>Like I'll be at a stop light,
 and look over at the car
 next to me</i>

1083
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:04,678
<i>and there she'll be,
 scowling at me with
 disapproval.</i>

1084
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:12,686
<i>Or I'll spot her across
 some crowded street,
 or train station,</i>

1085
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:14,789
<i>and we'll run toward
 each other like one
 of those cheesy TV movies.</i>

1086
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:18,759
<i>She'll hug me
 like a long, lost lover,</i>

1087
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:25,599
<i>then take my face
 in her long,</i>

1088
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,369
<i>graceful hands,</i>

1089
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:30,738
<i>look me in the eyes
 and say...</i>

1090
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:36,510
<i>..."I'm here, Kat.</i>

1091
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:37,978
<i>I'm here."</i>
