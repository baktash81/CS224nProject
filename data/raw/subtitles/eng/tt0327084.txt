1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,300
Oh, no!

2
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,000
Oome on!

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
Oome on, baby.

4
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
Grab it!

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
All right.

6
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,300
What...?

7
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
Vincent.

8
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
No, no, bad idea. Bad idea!

9
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Just take what you need.

10
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,100
Just take what you need.

11
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
What's...?

12
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
RJ?

13
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,000
No?

14
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,200
The moon's not full.

15
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,800
You woke me up a week early?

16
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Oh, no.

17
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,400
Don't tell me you're dumb enough
to actually try and steal my stuff.

18
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,300
RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you.

19
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,200
Please, I'm just a desperate guy
trying to feed his family.

20
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,100
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.

21
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,400
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Look, it's still in the cave.

22
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,300
So, technically, not stolen.

23
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,600
Oh, no!

24
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
No!

25
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,900
Slow!

26
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Stop!

27
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,400
That was close.

28
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,800
Vincent, wait! I can get it all back!

29
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,500
That's right!
If you eat me, you'd have to do it.

30
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,300
But I can get it. All of it!

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
- My red wagon?
- Redder!

32
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,900
- The blue cooler?
- Blue cooler. On my list!

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,300
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes!

34
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,100
And I want my Spuddies.
I love those things.

35
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,900
Oos with a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
So true. Painfully true.
And I'll tell you what.

37
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm gonna get you the giant picnic pack,
family-fun size.

38
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,300
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.

39
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
All right, RJ. I'm going back to sleep.

40
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,900
When that moon is full, I'm waking up.

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,400
And all my stuff had better
be right back where it was.

42
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,800
But that's just one week!
That's impossible for one guy!

43
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
A week's perfect. I'll get some helpers.

44
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Full moon, all my stuff.
And don't even think about running away.

45
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,900
Because if you do,
I will hunt you down and kill you.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,600
OK! OK, buddy! You just rest easy,
all right, 'cause I'm on it.

47
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,900
Hey, in a week from now, we're
gonna be laughing about this thing.

48
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Oh, boy, that's cold! That's cold!

49
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,500
The one place I didn't have a shell.

50
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Wow.

51
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,700
Spring.

52
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,300
That means there's only
274 days left till winter.

53
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,000
Everybody, wake up! Hibernation's over.

54
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh, morning!

55
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,100
- Morning, Hammy.
- I gotta go wee-wee!

56
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Not in the lake we drink from!

57
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,900
Let's go, all right, the rest of you.
It's spring!

58
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
That means we gotta get to work.

59
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,800
Finished. No, wait!

60
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,700
Oome on, everybody. Wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

61
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,100
Ya'll better listen.

62
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I've been holding something in
all winter, and I'm about to let it out.

63
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
- I'm up, I'm up!
- She means it. Let's go!

64
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Thank you, Stella.

65
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh, I can clear a room, Verne.
Oome on, that much I can do.

66
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,700
- Good morning.
- Good morning, everyone!

67
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,900
- How'd you guys sleep?
- Just a super-duper morning.

68
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,300
Oh, jeepers.

69
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,600
Whoa, not lookin' so good
around the eyes there, hon.

70
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,100
Bucky and Quillo were up
every three or four weeks.

71
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
And Spike kept poking me.

72
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,400
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.

73
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,300
He's the sharpest of the bunch there.

74
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,600
You know what?
How 'bout I take the day shift?

75
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,500
Oh, Lou, that'd be just super.

76
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
All right, kids, you heard your mother,

77
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
and now you listen to me.
Shape up there.

78
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh, boy.

79
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
This is what I was afraid of.

80
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Where's the food? Is there any left?
I'm hungry, so is there any left?

81
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,800
We ate all the food, Hammy. During the
winter? We gotta go get some more now.

82
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, right!
I buried some nuts in the woods.

83
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,400
I know where they are.
I'll be right back. Bye!

84
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
- That's enough.
- Dad, it was just snow.

85
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,800
But it could have been a predator.

86
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,100
Isn't playing dead a little... weak?

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,500
Heather, how many times must I say it?

88
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,100
Playing possum is what we do.

89
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,400
We die so that we live!

90
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm the boss of you, OK? So calm down.

91
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,000
That's what we need to find you
this year, don't you know? A good fella.

92
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,600
- A good fella? A good fella?
- Jeepers, here we go.

93
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Why does everyone think I need a man?

94
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,900
I look like a nest
and smell like a swamp.

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
So when you find a fella who's decent,

96
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,400
good with kids
and has no sense of smell, call me.

97
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,200
- Hello?
- I don't care who started it.

98
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,900
Oh, look, food.

99
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Well, I think you know what this means.

100
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,500
- Verne.
- Just a minute, Hammy.

101
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,400
This means we were nine berries
away from starvation.

102
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
Sorry. That was a little intense.

103
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
I meant really serious hunger pains.

104
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,600
Verne!

105
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,500
- Not finished, Hammy.
- Morning, Lou, Penny.

106
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
- Thanks.
- Hey, kids.

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,500
- What I want to tell you is...
- Verne!

108
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm not done, Hammy.
If you have to go again, just go.

109
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,500
OK. So all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.

110
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,200
So this year we need
to make sure that we fill the log...

111
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,400
- All the way to the top.
- Exactly. All the way to the top.

112
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,700
- Because what are we?
- Foragers!

113
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
- And what do we forage?
- Food!

114
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
- Right.
- Super, Verne, really super.

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
OK, Hammy.

116
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,400
- What is it?
- What is what?

117
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,900
What is it you want to tell me?

118
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,700
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

119
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Wait. Right on the tip of my tongue.
Oh, yeah!

120
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.

121
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
It's really scary. Follow me.

122
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,500
OK. Meeting called
on account of weird scary thing.

123
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's go.

124
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,300
Foragers...

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Hammy, what weird thing?

126
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,800
Oh. That weird thing.

127
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,900
It never ends!

128
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Hey!

129
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,900
It never ends that way too!

130
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,600
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.

131
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Yeah, jeepers is the word there, hon.

132
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

133
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,200
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

134
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,400
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.

135
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,300
It's OK, it's just a...
What is this thing, Lou?

136
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,600
I... Well, it's a... It's... Verne?

137
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,200
Well, it's... it's obviously...

138
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,700
...some kind of bush?

139
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,300
I'd be less afraid of it
if I just knew what it was called.

140
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,200
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?

141
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,400
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.

142
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,900
- I'm a lot less scared of Steve.
- Oh, great and powerful Steve!

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
- What do you want?
- I don't think it can speak.

144
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,700
I heard that, young man!

145
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,200
- You get over here right now!
- OK.

146
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,600
Hammy, get back here.

147
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,400
- Steve is angry!
- It came from the other side of Steve.

148
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,100
I mean the bush. I mean... Jeez!

149
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,200
There's only one way
we're gonna find out what this thing is,

150
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,900
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

151
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,000
Steve ate Verne!

152
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,000
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

153
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Stella, don't!
I'm not eaten, I just tripped.

154
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

155
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Kids, come on, hurry up! You'll be late!

156
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
What is this place?

157
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Oh, hey there, little...

158
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,500
...fella.

159
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,900
Hi.

160
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

161
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Operator. Oan I help you?

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
No, I can talk. I'm just driving.

163
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Verne's back.

164
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
- Verne!
- Jeepers!

165
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,600
- You OK?
- Help him up.

166
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,600
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!

167
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,500
They must have come while
we were hibernating. It was awful.

168
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were

169
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,800
whacking me with these sticks
like it was some sort of sick game.

170
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,300
You should have died!
You should have laid down and died.

171
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,300
- Dad.
- That's not the worst part.

172
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,100
Half the forest is gone.

173
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,200
The oak trees and the berry bushes,

174
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,200
they're just... they're just gone.

175
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,600
Jeepers.

176
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,000
What'll we do for food?

177
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,300
How are we gonna live?

178
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,200
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

179
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,900
We will be fine as long
as no one goes over Steve again.

180
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,600
It's called a hedge, and it is not
to be feared, my amphibious friend.

181
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
It is the gateway to the good life.

182
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm a reptile, actually.

183
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
But, you know, it's a common mistake.

184
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
And you are?

185
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,700
Where are my manners. I'm RJ.

186
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,700
Don't think I'm prying,
but I couldn't help overhearing,

187
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
and I can shed a little light on what
this whole hedge situation is about.

188
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,100
You see, what was once mere wilderness

189
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,400
is now 54 acres of man-made,
manicured, air-conditioned paradise.

190
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Except for that little-bitty speck.
You are here.

191
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,100
No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

192
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,500
You gather food,
store it for the winter?

193
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,400
- We fill the log!
- Hammy.

194
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,400
Really? This log? This cave-like log?

195
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,200
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.

196
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,100
Let me ask ya, how long's it take?

197
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,600
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and seventy-four days.

198
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
- Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.

199
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Not if we work together.

200
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,400
You've got the food gathering skills,
I've got the know-how,

201
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,600
- and they have the food!
- How much food?

202
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,900
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,300
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,

204
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
I don't think
we're interested in eating.

205
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,900
I don't know,
the guy's making a lot of sense to me.

206
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with wazoo food there.

207
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,000
No, you're not. The tail is tingling.

208
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,400
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on. The what is what?

209
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,600
When something doesn't feel right,
my tail tingles. Let me tell you,

210
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,300
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

211
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Listen. Verne, right? This isn't
something you need to be afraid of.

212
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,600
Well, I am. And for good reason.

213
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,000
This is not a birthmark.

214
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,700
That's because you
went over there without a guide.

215
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.

216
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,500
Not interested in the most
delicious food you've ever tasted?

217
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
- No!
- Oome on.

218
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,600
Not interested!

219
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,300
OK. I get it.

220
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,000
I understand. This is something
that you're just not open to.

221
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,400
Whoa!

222
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.

223
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,300
What is that?

224
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,100
That, my friend, is a magical
combination of corn flour,

225
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,600
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

226
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,400
a.k.a., the chip. Nacho cheese flavour.

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,600
- Over here! Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.

228
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Yeah, Verne, those were good!

229
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,400
It's all good.
And we're going over there. Tonight!

230
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,300
Yeah!

231
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Welcome to suburbia.

232
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,700
Welcome to suburbia.

233
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
- Wow!
- Look at that!

234
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,100
Hey, Mom, look at us! Look at us!

235
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, my! Hon, look at this.

236
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,600
Jeepers.

237
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,900
How's that tail, Verne?

238
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,100
Listen, if anybody in this family
gets hurt, I'm holding you responsible.

239
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,100
They're having a good time.
I'll take responsibility for that.

240
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
- This is neat.
- Look at that.

241
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,600
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,

242
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I took a few clippings out of my quills
to do a little comparison.

243
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,900
Look at this, the grass
seems to be greener over here.

244
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,400
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

245
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,200
Yeah, cos the raccoon says...

246
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
OK, enough about him. I get it.

247
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,200
So he can do a couple of tricks. I mean,
it's not like he can walk on water.

248
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
Hey, everybody! This way to the food!

249
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,900
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

250
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,900
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

251
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,700
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk.

252
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,900
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans fit in there?

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,600
Usually? One.

254
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,100
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

255
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,100
Of the homeowner's association? Right.

256
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,500
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

257
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,900
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

258
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,600
And they are just as scared of us
as we are of them.

259
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,800
Now, if a human does
happen to see you, just lay down,

260
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,600
roll over and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

261
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,300
The charter, which you signed, says
the grass is supposed to be two inches,

262
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,600
and according to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

263
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Oould we just get the food and go?
Really, do they have it or not?

264
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,400
Didn't you see it? It was in the box.
They've always got food with them.

265
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,300
We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

266
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,300
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

267
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,900
The human mouth is called a "pie hole."

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
The human being
is called a "couch potato."

269
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,000
That is a device to summon food.

270
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
That is one of the many voices of food.

271
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,700
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

272
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,000
That is one of the many
food transportation vehicles.

273
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,300
Humans bring the food, take the food,

274
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
ship the food, they drive the food,

275
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,800
they wear the food! That gets
the food hot. That keeps the food cold.

276
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
That... I'm not sure what that is.

277
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,100
What do you know? Food!

278
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,700
That is the altar
where they worship food.

279
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.

280
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,500
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.

281
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,200
Food! Food! Food! Food!

282
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,000
Food!

283
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,300
So you think they have enough?

284
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, they don't.
For humans, enough is never enough!

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
And what do they do
with the stuff they don't eat?

286
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,800
They put it in gleaming, silver cans,

287
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,100
just for us.

288
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
Sweetjeepers.

289
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,100
Dig in!

290
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,800
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.

291
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,300
- Wow.
- Share there, everyone, share.

292
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,400
That's a diaper.
And that does come out of a wazoo.

293
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,200
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

294
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,200
And these things are just the scraps!

295
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Wait'll you see what comes
in the boxes, packages and cans!

296
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm telling you, stick with me,
and in one week

297
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,200
we will gather enough food to...

298
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,700
- To feed a bear.
- What?

299
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,900
Just a figure of speech.

300
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,800
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

301
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,400
What is it, baby?

302
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,800
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our...

303
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,300
No! Nix that! Run!

304
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,700
- Run!
- Get outta here!

305
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,100
Run!

306
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,700
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

307
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,600
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

308
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,000
Filthy vermin!

309
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,300
Verne's right, that was horrible.

310
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.

311
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,800
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what I was talking about!

312
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
These humans don't want us around.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So we scared her,
and she overreacted. No biggie.

314
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,200
No biggie?
That is what we call a biggie.

315
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,300
Oome on, think about the food.
It was worth it for that food, huh?

316
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
That stuff is to die for!

317
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,200
Let me rephrase that.

318
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,200
No, to die for. You nailed that part.

319
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,000
Look, maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag.

320
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,500
- What?
- But I think I speak

321
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

322
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,600
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

323
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,000
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.

324
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,300
You haven't even tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?

325
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,600
That is the way to store some fat.
You'll be sweatin' through the winter!

326
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,700
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right, you guys sleep on it!

327
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,700
Good idea.
I'm gonna check back with you.

328
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,200
Shoot!

329
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,900
Almost had 'em.

330
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,200
- Good night, Heather.
- Good night.

331
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,700
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.

332
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.

333
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,600
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.

334
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,200
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.

335
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,500
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.

336
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,700
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

337
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,700
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.

338
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,100
When we wake up,
only 273 days left till winter.

339
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,300
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

340
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Spuddies...

341
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Oooler... Wagon... Redder wagon.

342
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,700
Time's up, RJ.

343
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
But I have six more days! No!

344
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,600
OK. Four paws, fur.

345
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,800
Still alive, still alive.

346
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,700
So, what are you saying?
You want me to take 'em to his house?

347
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

348
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,200
Jimmy was pushing me on the bus.

349
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,600
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

350
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,500
Next time he shoves you, beat him up.

351
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,300
Yes!

352
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,900
OK, kids, dive in. There it is.
Bark for breakfast!

353
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,800
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.

354
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,100
No, you don't.

355
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,500
OK. This is great.

356
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
Granted, it takes some time to chew.

357
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,100
But that...

358
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
That was very satisfying.

359
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,400
And, by the way,
lots of fibre in there too.

360
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,800
- Lots.
- I gotta admit, that does look tasty.

361
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,700
What are you doing here?

362
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm here to help you with your...
foraging thing.

363
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,000
Look, Verne, you said a word
yesterday about your little gang here.

364
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,300
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

365
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,200
- Family?
- Right, right, that.

366
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,400
You know, that got me right here.

367
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,600
You see, Verne,
I used to have all of that.

368
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,300
My own place, surrounded by loved ones,

369
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
universal remote.

370
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,400
But then all that went away with...

371
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,400
...the weed hacker incident.

372
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Oh, God.

373
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,500
Oh, come here.

374
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Yeah, that feels good, doesn't it?

375
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,700
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.

376
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,300
We could always use
the extra hand there, you know.

377
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,000
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

378
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,900
OK.

379
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,900
Not your problem. I'll just go.

380
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,500
This is me...

381
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,600
...going.

382
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,000
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.

383
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
Really nice getting to know you.

384
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

385
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,700
- Take care.
- All right, all right.

386
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,500
Hey, RJ?

387
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,500
You can... you can stay.

388
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
- Oome here, ya big lug!
- No.

389
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside

390
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
there was a soft,
nougat-y centre in there.

391
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,300
- Do you mind if I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.

392
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,700
Great. Hey, can I work with Hammy?

393
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,300
Wanna help me find my nuts?

394
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,700
Very tempting, Hammy, very tempting.
But first, I want to show you this.

395
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,500
You like this cookie?

396
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,000
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.

397
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,400
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

398
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,800
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

399
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,600
that they are hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

400
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,600
- The Doyles' is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

401
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,900
There they are.
America's most coveted cookies.

402
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners and Smackeroons.

403
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,700
And guess what? They're all yours!

404
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,700
Whoa, Hamilton. Hold on there, fella.

405
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,900
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.

406
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,900
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,

407
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,900
if we successfully marry your
manic energy to my brilliant plan!

408
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,700
- You with me, kid?
- I... I... I...

409
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,400
The I's have it! Let's ride.

410
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,900
Mrs Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.

411
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,900
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,

412
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,800
- her face explodes or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.

413
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
- Wait, wait. How many boxes of...?
- Hey!

414
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,700
You stay away from those cookies.
They're mine!

415
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,700
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.

416
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,200
Oh, we have so much work to do.

417
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,800
Oome on, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

418
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,400
What we're going for here is
a vicious, man-eating, rabid squirrel.

419
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,300
- Oan you handle that?
- Excuse me?

420
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,500
Yes... Hammy.

421
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,300
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute and cuddly, so...

422
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,700
Rabid, not rabbit.

423
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Oh... What?

424
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,000
OK. So first we're gonna muss the hair.

425
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,700
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...

426
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
We're gonna mat the fur a little bit.

427
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,300
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.

428
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
Liking that a lot.

429
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,900
Show me that wild look in your eye.
Oome on!

430
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,100
- I can burp my ABOs! A, B, O.
- Hammy!

431
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,800
I just really need you
to focus right now, OK?

432
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
- OK.
- Thank you.

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Let's see. There we... Hang on a minute.

434
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,500
Not that, not that. No, no.

435
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,200
Aha! Nice!

436
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
Hammy?

437
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,500
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

438
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Go on, get out there. Shoo, shoo!

439
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,200
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!

440
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm rabid! I'm foaming at the mouth.

441
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,900
I'm foaming, very scary rabid squirrel.

442
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
Rabies!

443
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!

444
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,900
I know. You're right behind me...

445
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,600
Got it! Stand back!

446
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,000
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!

447
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,000
- Walk it off! Walk that one off!
- What's going on? Is that Hammy?

448
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,300
- Everything's under control. Go back.
- You call that under control?

449
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,100
- He's under attack!
- He's working!

450
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,300
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

451
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,200
What are you doing? Watch out!

452
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,500
- Hold still! I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!

453
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
- Yuck!
- Gross!

454
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,700
- Nasty!
- Oh, my God, this is so gross!

455
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Verne!

456
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.

457
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,800
Or, should I say, au naturel.

458
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,900
Hammy, you were awesome, my man!

459
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,700
You had me scared. I was about to come
out and beat you with a book myself.

460
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,200
You're all right, aren't ya?
Of course you are. You are Hammy!

461
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,400
Those bruises are gonna heal.
You know what? Ohicks dig scars.

462
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,400
- There!
- Over there!

463
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,700
That's where the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.

464
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,100
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

465
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,000
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.

466
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,900
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

467
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Thanks, Mom.

468
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm sorry, Janis, did I
just hear them say "rabid squirrel"?

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think they mightjust be overreacting.

470
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,400
What if they're not? What if we have
a potential pandemic on our hands?

471
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,700
Vermin running loose, spreading disease

472
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,100
and lowering our property values?

473
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,300
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

474
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,300
Fine. Worry about your casserole,

475
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,600
and I'll worry about the end
of suburban peace and tranquillity!

476
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,700
That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

477
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,900
Got a box right over here for ya,
Penny.

478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,500
That is good. Eat up! Anything that
tastes this good has to be good for you.

479
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,700
Feel buzzing in the back of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.

480
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,000
It's what keeps humans going, why they
don't hibernate. Add a little of this...

481
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,900
...and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.

482
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
I like it! I like it!

483
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,700
Hold on, Hamsquad.
The last thing you need is caffeine.

484
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,100
That's right. Oome on, dig in.

485
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,100
Because this, my friends,
is just the beginning.

486
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,900
What?

487
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,500
- Up, down! Up, down!
- He's getting away!

488
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,200
Oh, yeah!

489
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Read it and weep.

490
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,300
Hello? I need every business listing
you have under "exterminator."

491
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,500
Ozzie!

492
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,900
- Whoa, Mom! You hit a possum.
- Oh, my goodness.

493
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Do you think it's dead?

494
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
Oh, no.

495
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,900
- Wow!
- Touch it.

496
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
- Oan I poke him?
- No!

497
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,800
These poor little creatures.

498
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,400
- What's going on?
- Oome check it out.

499
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Debbie? I don't remember seeing
a permit app for a gathering.

500
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,600
Groups of more than one
who wish to get...

501
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,300
Timmy, get the shovel from the car.

502
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,600
Lights fading, limbs growing cold.

503
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,700
- I see a tunnel.
- Oh, no.

504
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,500
Mother, is that you
beckoning me into the light?

505
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,500
Must move toward the light.

506
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,900
- What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knocked his brains loose.

507
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,100
You went too far.
Let's get out of here and leave this...

508
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,700
This...

509
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,700
- Nice catch, Verne.
- Yes! Yes!

510
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,000
- You're dangerous. You're insane!
- Sweet music, I'm going home!

511
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,100
Goodbye, cruel world!

512
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,500
Rosebud.

513
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,300
- Now can I poke him?
- No!

514
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,700
You see? This is exactly why
I called the exterminator.

515
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,100
To kill them
before they get hurt like this.

516
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,100
Everybody, get out of here right now!

517
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,500
Right! Kids, grab those handles.
Get the stuff.

518
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
- What?
- Here we go. I threw out my back.

519
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,500
- Let's go.
- Get down.

520
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,100
Oh, no.

521
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,300
I believe someone phoned
about an animal problem?

522
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,000
The solution is standing before you.

523
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,400
Dwayne LaFondont is here.

524
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,200
Where have you been? I'm throwing
a "Welcome to the Neighbourhood" party,

525
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,400
and so far Debbie's car has killed
more animals than you have.

526
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Stand down, sister.

527
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,100
I personally guarantee that there will
not be a living thing at this party.

528
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,200
The Verminator is on the job.

529
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Leave it. Leave it!

530
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,200
What do we have here?

531
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,400
Didelphis marsupialis virginianus.

532
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,700
Approximately ten pounds.

533
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,200
Male.

534
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,100
- I think he's dead.
- Oh, really?

535
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,500
Do you, in fact, have an
associates degree from Vermtech?

536
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,400
I think he wants you to think he's dead.

537
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,100
- Go! Go!
- Move, move!

538
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,700
- That's it! Run! Go!
...voluntary shock state.

539
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,300
Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.

540
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

541
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,600
What the...?

542
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,100
Kill it! Kill it!

543
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,700
Thank you all for coming!
You were a great audience!

544
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,300
Oh, man!

545
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,500
All right, what am I up against here?

546
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Possum, porcupine, skunk, squirrel,

547
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,700
raccoon, amphibian.

548
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,900
- Reptile.
- No.

549
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Reptile.

550
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,900
That's what I call
a super-duper performance there.

551
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,700
- I wanna do it again!
- Beyond super.

552
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,500
They were riveted. You were awesome!

553
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,100
All right!

554
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,800
Dad. I just gotta say,
that was... that was pretty good.

555
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Props for the Ozman!

556
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,400
- Ozman!
- Yeah! Yeah!

557
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,100
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership:

558
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,700
RJ.

559
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,900
RJ!

560
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
Brilliant!

561
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,300
RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.

562
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,500
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

563
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,900
- What a team!
- That raccoon knows what he's doing.

564
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
You're my hero there, fella.

565
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,000
- Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on!

566
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,500
Yeah, we wanna show you something.
Oome on, hurry!

567
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Oheck it out.

568
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,600
Your new home!

569
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,900
And look,
we got a place for you right here!

570
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,200
That's for me?

571
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,700
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?

572
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,000
This isn't anything
like what I had, Lou.

573
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,200
- Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

574
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
- Is that my bag?
- Yeah, we brought it in here

575
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,200
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in that tree.

576
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,600
Really? Wow.

577
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,500
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.

578
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,800
- I hot-wired the HD converter.
- We get a thousand channels!

579
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,000
Oan you take the remote
before my dad does?

580
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,000
Wow. A universal remote?

581
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,000
This is nice, guys. Really nice.

582
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,000
We now return to A Scoundrel Among Us.

583
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,800
You should be ashamed of yourself.

584
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,500
We let you into our family,
and you've deceived us.

585
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I gave you my heart, and you
ripped it into a million pieces.

586
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,300
Get real, Kevin. When you feel like a
dirtbag, it's because you're a dirtbag.

587
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Right? So just own it,
just say it out loud. "I am a dirtbag."

588
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,600
Dirtbag.
I don't think that guy's a real doctor.

589
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,500
What do you think there, RJ? RJ?

590
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,000
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, RJ.

591
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,800
What are you doing, man?
You are getting in way too deep.

592
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,300
Just get the food.

593
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Feed the bear. Get the food.

594
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,000
Feed the bear.

595
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,500
Where's the food? Where's the food?!

596
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,600
Verne. What are you doing?

597
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
Getting things back
to the way they were.

598
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,100
- No, don't. How about I just leave?
- Good.

599
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,000
You leave, and I return
this stuff to the rightful owners.

600
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,600
What?! Why?

601
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,200
Because we've angered the humans.

602
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,500
And we don't wanna end up
like that rabbit.

603
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,100
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.

604
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,700
Verne, you don't understand!
We need this stuff!

605
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,300
No, we don't!

606
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,500
You can't take it!

607
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Yes, I can!

608
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
- Let go!
- You let go!

609
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
- I have to have it.
- No!

610
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,200
Verne. Move slow,
keep your voice low and follow me.

611
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,500
What?

612
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,600
No.

613
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,200
No. I'm not falling
for any more of your smooth talk!

614
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't know what you're up to,
but my entire shell is tingling.

615
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,400
Know what?
I'm listening to it this time,

616
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,100
- and I'm putting my foot down.
- No, no.

617
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,500
Play?

618
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,100
Play!

619
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,100
Play! Play! Play!

620
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,700
Play! Play! Play! Play! Play!

621
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,500
Play!

622
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,400
Let's play!

623
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,500
Play!

624
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
Jeez...

625
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,200
Play! Play! Play! Play! Play! Play!

626
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,200
- Down, boy. Sit. Roll over!
- Play!

627
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,600
- Play dead!
- Play!

628
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,300
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.

629
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,300
Play.

630
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,800
Play, play, play, play.

631
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,000
Play, play, play, play.

632
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

633
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,000
You're dropping all the food, man!

634
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,200
- Here, catch.
- Play!

635
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,000
Are you hungry? Look, food.

636
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,300
Oh, my back!

637
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,900
Look, people! Play with them!

638
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,900
- Look out!
- Stop! What's he doing?

639
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,200
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.

640
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm all right,
I'm fine. It's OK. It's...

641
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Verne, unhook the chain.

642
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,800
Play!

643
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,300
No.

644
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,300
Yes.

645
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,200
Bad.

646
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,100
Oh, boy.

647
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,100
Verne, I told you to unhook the chain.

648
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,000
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...

649
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,500
You're the devil.

650
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,600
No! No!

651
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,200
Verne, you all right there?

652
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,500
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.

653
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,100
- What happened?
- What happened?

654
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,600
It's gone. The food! Gone!

655
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,800
- What?
- Gone?

656
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,100
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!

657
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,100
- Verne?
- I returned it

658
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,500
- to its rightful owner.
- What?

659
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,900
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?

660
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...

661
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,000
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.

662
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, Verne, what were you thinking?
The log was full!

663
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,700
- Full ofjunk.
- So, what are you saying there?

664
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,400
That the food we gather our way isn't as
good as the food we gather your way?

665
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,600
Your way? You mean his way.

666
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,700
Oan't you see RJ is just using you?

667
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,400
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

668
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,000
You have got to trust me on this.
Don't you understand

669
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,800
there's something wrong with him?

670
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,500
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.

671
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,700
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

672
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,200
I'm starting to think that tingle
is just you being jealous.

673
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,700
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.

674
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,100
He's embracing the future there,
and you're just holding us back.

675
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,500
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

676
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,900
See what you've done here?

677
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,600
If they listened to half the stuff
you're telling them,

678
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,200
they'll be dead within a week. You are
only interested in taking advantage

679
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,000
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

680
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm not stupid.

681
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,100
OK, I didn't mean...

682
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,000
I meant ignorant.

683
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,900
To the ways over... over there.

684
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Oome on, you guys.
You know I didn't mean it like that.

685
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,600
Don't... don't do this.

686
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,300
Stella? Ozzie?

687
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,400
Hammy? You know I didn't...

688
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,500
- Hammy...
- I'm not stupid.

689
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,500
Please.

690
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,700
- Good night, Uncle RJ.
- Good night, kiddo.

691
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Moon's full, RJ. See ya in the morning.

692
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,000
This'll cut you down to size!

693
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
I got ya!

694
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,600
- Is it done?
- Affirmative.

695
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,000
Did you put this one in?
This Depelter Turbo?

696
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,400
That's a contraband item, ma'am, as it
is illegal in every state, except Texas.

697
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,900
I don't care if it's
against the Geneva Oonvention.

698
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,700
- I want it!
- I thought you might.

699
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,600
So I took the liberty
of installing it for you.

700
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Adios, animal infestation.

701
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,300
Oh, my.

702
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,100
What have I done?

703
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,700
- Shouldn't have taken all that food.
- What?

704
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,600
I shouldn't have taken all that food.

705
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,500
I was just trying to return
things to the way they were.

706
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,200
I was just being cautious.
Oos that's what I am.

707
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
I'm naturally tentative.

708
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,800
There's even places in my shell
I haven't been.

709
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,000
You, on the other hand,
you're like... cool.

710
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,900
And crazy and fearless.

711
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,700
I think they're right.
I think I'm justjealous.

712
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,800
Verne, believe me,
you should not be jealous of me.

713
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,100
You got a good thing here. You're trying
to do what's best for your family.

714
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,400
And I think you're
what's best for them now.

715
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,400
What about your tail?

716
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,400
My head says listen to my tail, my tail
says listen to my head, and I just...

717
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,800
...end up with an upset stomach.

718
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,000
That's why you need
to be in charge now.

719
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,000
- You don't know what's going on.
- And you do.

720
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,100
- So, what's the problem?
- This, Verne, is the problem.

721
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,500
- You see this?
- I'm listening.

722
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,100
Just...

723
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,000
Just hang on a second. All right?

724
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,700
I...

725
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,000
- You throwing the party?
- Yes. To the right.

726
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,800
There are protective booties
to put on over your shoes.

727
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,200
Yes! Yes!

728
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,900
- What is this?
- What?

729
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,600
Oh, that...

730
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,000
...is a...

731
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,600
...list of all the stuff
that you lost, Verne.

732
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,100
- Really?
- It's a big, long list. You can see.

733
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,500
You're a... organised little guy,
aren't you? Nice job.

734
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,000
You know what? I know a place
so chock-full of food,

735
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,900
we could get it all back in one night.

736
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,900
Great. Let's go. Where is it?

737
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,100
- Inside that house.
- What?

738
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,700
- What is the point of this thing?
- Just send it down.

739
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,700
What Verne is trying to say is...

740
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,900
I mean, it's hard to really
sum it all up in just one word.

741
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,400
- But...
- I'm sorry.

742
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, come here.

743
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,000
- Oh, come here, Verne.
- That's right.

744
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,100
OK! Listen, stay in the huddle.
Here's the plan.

745
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,800
Now, the traps are set here, here, here,

746
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,400
here, here, here, here, here, here,

747
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,200
here, here, here and here.

748
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:16,000
Here, here, here, here.

749
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,200
Big one here, here,

750
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,700
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?

751
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,100
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.

752
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,000
OK, Verne? Looking a little green.

753
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,500
I blacked out for a second there,
but I get the idea.

754
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,400
There's lights, traps...
I might need to change my shell.

755
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,200
OK, this is us.

756
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,100
- Oan I be the car?
- I wanna be the car!

757
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,400
- I'm the car. You be the shoe.
- The shoe is lame.

758
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,000
Why don't you be
that snazzy-looking iron?

759
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,400
Hey, it's not important!

760
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,600
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.

761
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,900
The plan works in three simple steps.
Step one, kill the lights.

762
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,600
Step two, get inside. Step three,
get out with mountain of food.

763
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,300
But this place is like a fortress.
Walls, so high. Doors, impenetrable.

764
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,000
- How will we get in?
- The collar is the key.

765
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,100
Literally, the collar.

766
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,400
It's like a key
that opens the door and if...

767
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,700
And what? You think he's just
gonna hand over his collar to you?

768
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,900
Not to me, my femme fatale. To you.

769
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,400
- Her?
- Me?

770
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,900
You, Stella, will get that cat
to give you his collar by using...

771
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,900
- My stink.
...your feminine charms.

772
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Was that out loud?

773
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,000
Look, raccoon, maybe that mask
you're wearing is obstructing your view,

774
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,000
but if you haven't noticed, I'm a skunk.

775
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,000
On the outside, maybe. But I'm looking
inside, Stella, and I see a fox.

776
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,800
And all we gotta do is get her out.

777
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,000
- Scissors.
- Scissors?

778
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,600
- Here we go.
- Watch the...

779
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,500
- Oharcoal.
- Oharcoal?

780
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,400
- Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

781
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,700
- Oork.
- Oork? Don't you dare.

782
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,200
- Get 'em!
- Score! Yeah!

783
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,600
One more thing.

784
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,400
Stop. That's it.

785
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
our work here is done.

786
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,600
Oh, my.

787
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,100
- Big jeepers.
- She's all like, wow.

788
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,800
What?

789
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,400
Meow.

790
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,200
- Whoa!
- Amazing!

791
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,200
Gosh, she looks...

792
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,300
Wow.

793
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,700
All right, gang, this is it.
We're going in.

794
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,300
Not again. Dang it!
Those things are so lifelike.

795
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,700
Ourse you, plastic moldsman.

796
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,300
OK, Hammy.

797
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,200
Hammy!

798
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,300
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

799
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

800
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,800
Hammy, I told you that cookie's junk!

801
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,600
But I like a cookie.

802
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,900
What's going on? Is everything OK?

803
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,600
Here we go!

804
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,200
Oome on, Hammy, come on. Follow the
pretty light. There it is, that's it.

805
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,300
That's it, that's it.

806
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,200
There it is. Go get it.

807
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,900
That's it, that's it.

808
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,000
Go get it, you little nut!

809
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,300
Bingo! OK, step two.

810
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,200
I thought we'd be dead by step two,
so this is going great!

811
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,100
OK, gorgeous, you're on.

812
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,700
Man, this better be one stupid cat.

813
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,300
Audio, go!

814
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,400
She's supposed to be a cat.

815
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,200
Put it on cat.
Maybe the cat likes a cow.

816
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,400
Who goes there?

817
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,300
You're a cat! You're a cat!

818
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
You're a cat!

819
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
I mean, I'm a cat.

820
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,000
- Meow.
- Yeah, right.

821
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,000
Shoo. Go on, get away from here.

822
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,100
My owner does not give scraps
to common strays.

823
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,800
Oommon strays?
All right, you asked for it.

824
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,800
- Get the collar!
- Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.

825
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,400
- Mind if I have a look?
- No! Oome no closer!

826
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,300
I must not be so near
a creature of the outdoor woods.

827
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,300
- Away with your filth!
- My filth?

828
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,000
- My filth?!
- Oh, jeepers, here we go.

829
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,800
OK, that's it. I am sick and tired
of everybody taking one look at me

830
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,200
and running away
cos they think I'm filthy.

831
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,700
Well, I got news for you.

832
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,500
I didn't get all primped and preened
to have some over-fed, pompous puffball

833
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,300
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!

834
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,500
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!

835
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!

836
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,300
It is bold. I like it.

837
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,600
Well, believe me,
there's more where that came from...

838
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,700
...puffball.
- All right, team, let's boogie.

839
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,300
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.

840
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,100
- What...? What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

841
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,700
- My eyes.
- They are luminous.

842
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,700
Luminous? Dang.

843
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,300
You know, I think this
is the part where I blacked out.

844
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,500
Did the little shoes and cars
actually get into the house?

845
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,300
- So you got a name?
- Yes.

846
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,200
It is a Persian name,
for I am Persian.

847
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,800
I was born Prince
Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.

848
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,600
That's a mouthful.
Oan I just call you Tiger?

849
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,700
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.

850
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,500
Animals are in the house.

851
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,400
Wow!

852
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,700
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

853
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,200
- Yes! OK, stations, everybody.
- Let's boogie!

854
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,500
- We got it.
- Here we go.

855
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,300
No grip, no grip, no grip.

856
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,800
- Hammy! Less claw, more pad.
- Oh, OK.

857
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,200
That hurt.

858
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,600
- Just a minute, I'll be right there.
- What was that?

859
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,900
Lt... That's just the sound
of my heart. Oan't you hear it?

860
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,800
This way, this way!

861
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,600
OK, OK, we're good. Go back to work.

862
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,300
There ya go.

863
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,900
Here, catch!

864
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,200
Oh, boy.

865
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,500
Yes, I'm gonna make it.

866
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,800
My father, he had
an exceptionally flat face.

867
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,900
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.

868
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,300
Fascinating.

869
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,200
...inside, I have a multi-levelled
climby-thing with shag carpet.

870
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,100
- Oome, I show you.
- No, no!

871
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,900
I haven't told you about my life.

872
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,300
Good, good. Going great, going great.

873
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,900
What is that?

874
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,900
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.

875
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,400
Where'd she go?

876
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,300
Get down and stay down.

877
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,700
Move. Move.

878
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,300
Oome on! We've gotta go
before she comes back.

879
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,300
- No! Not without those Spuddies.
- What?

880
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,700
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.
Heather, keep an eye on that human.

881
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,900
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!

882
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,200
The tingle, the tingle.

883
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,500
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

884
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,500
Vincent, this'll only take a second

885
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,800
- Vincent?
- Where?

886
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,200
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.

887
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,100
Simple slip of the bear. Tongue!

888
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,100
Just bear with me
is what I meant to say.

889
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,900
There's no bear.

890
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,700
Lights fading. Limbs growing co...

891
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,400
Heather.

892
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,500
Oh, Heather!

893
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,500
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.

894
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,900
I thought you were dead.

895
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,800
I learned from the best, Dad.

896
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,100
That's my girl.

897
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Oome to Papa.

898
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,600
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

899
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,300
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!

900
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,600
Let's get out of here
because we have what we need.

901
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,800
- No, we don't.
- What are you talking about?

902
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,800
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.

903
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,200
I've got this long to hand over that
wagon of food to a homicidal bear.

904
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,200
If these Spuddies aren't on the menu,
then I will be. Now let go of my tail.

905
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,900
What?

906
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,600
Let go!

907
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,300
Hey, whoa!

908
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,300
I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

909
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,100
Stella, Stella,
where are you going? Stella!

910
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
Stella!

911
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,200
Look, it's not you.
It won't work, OK, because I'm a...

912
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,000
Skunk!

913
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,100
Yeah, that. Sorry you have to see this.

914
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
Fire in the hole!

915
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,700
- Oh, my...
- This smell doesn't bother you?

916
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,800
No. This face was bred for beauty.

917
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,400
I cannot smell a thing.

918
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,000
You can't smell?

919
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,500
To the door! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

920
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,700
- Run!
- This way!

921
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,200
Let's party.

922
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,700
Bunnies!

923
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,600
Flee, my love.

924
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,600
Run, that way. Outside!

925
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,300
Move, kids! Oome on!

926
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,800
Buenos días, reptile.

927
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,100
You've just been verminated.

928
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,100
You stink.

929
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,700
That's because you let them
into my... house!

930
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,000
- Those...
- Hey, Nancy, stop your honkin'.

931
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,300
These little guys will be
disposed of quickly and humanely.

932
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,000
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

933
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,700
It was a pleasure
doing business with you, ma'am.

934
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,900
- What's he gonna do to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.

935
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,400
I don't wanna die, Dad. Not for real.

936
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,200
There, there, there, sweetheart.
We'll be OK.

937
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,200
You were right about him, Verne.

938
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,900
We shoulda listened. Sorry there.

939
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,100
No.

940
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,900
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

941
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,200
I should've known better.

942
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,100
Wow!

943
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,300
Vincent?

944
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,100
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.

945
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,700
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say...

946
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,500
...that, right there,

947
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,200
is a thing of beauty.

948
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,200
That is the most vicious, deceitful,

949
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,200
self-serving thing I've ever seen.

950
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,000
Olassic RJ.

951
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:23,000
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

952
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,100
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up just like me.

953
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,400
Having everything you ever wanted.

954
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,100
But I already had that.

955
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,500
What, them? Who are you kidding?

956
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,200
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

957
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,100
Always will be.

958
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,800
It's how guys like you and me survive.

959
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,000
So a few saps got hurt in the process.

960
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,600
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

961
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,800
Actually, I do.

962
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,900
And right now, they really need me.

963
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,200
So I really need this!

964
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,000
RJ!

965
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,100
What the...?

966
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,800
- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?

967
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,100
You sorry sack of rat dung.

968
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,900
Whoa, Stella, this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.

969
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,900
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

970
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,400
- Bear!
- What's that?

971
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
- Bear!
- Hair?

972
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,900
- Bear!
- Dare?

973
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,900
- Bear!
- Oh, bear!

974
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,600
What?

975
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,000
- We're out of control!
- We can drive.

976
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,000
- It's just like Auto-Homicide 3!
- What?

977
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,600
Verne, let me in!
Wrong button! Wrong button!

978
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,600
- Please select destination.
- Take us home! Take us to the log!

979
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,700
Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.

980
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,900
We got it!

981
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,700
- Hammy! Let me in!
- Not listening to RJ.

982
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,800
Kids, lose that bear!

983
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,200
What weapons do we have?

984
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,700
- We've got a hammer.
- Oool.

985
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,700
You little...

986
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,700
Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!

987
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,000
- Let me in, let me in!
- No! Ring-tailed charlatan!

988
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,100
Ozzie!

989
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,100
He's trying to help us. Just let him in.

990
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,600
- After what he did to us?
- But he came back.

991
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,200
And he brought a bear.

992
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,400
- No fighting while we're driving.
- We will turn this van around, mister.

993
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,900
He started it.

994
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm telling you, he's trying to help us.

995
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,400
But, Verne, you're the one
who always says trust your tail.

996
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,000
But it's not tingling.

997
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,600
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hey!

998
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,400
Thank you, thank you.

999
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,600
- You're dead, RJ!
- Duck!

1000
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,200
- And your friends are next.
- Look out!

1001
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Make an immediate left turn.

1002
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,900
Bonus points!

1003
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,000
Yeah!

1004
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,600
RJ!

1005
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,900
Yeah!

1006
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,100
- Look out.
- High score.

1007
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,700
No, no, no, no!

1008
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,200
You have arrived.

1009
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,000
Everybody all right?

1010
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,400
- Oome on!
- We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

1011
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,700
The old jazz dance injury.

1012
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,000
- Oome on, come on. Quillo!
- Go, go, go.

1013
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,200
- Did we make it?
- That was close!

1014
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,500
- All right!
- Are we here?

1015
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,000
Penny? The kids here? Hammy?

1016
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,800
Scary clown.

1017
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,000
Look out!

1018
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,500
A weed hacker, Verne. A weed hacker!

1019
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,100
- Hey!
- Up, up, go up.

1020
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,500
Show your little rat faces.
Filthy creatures.

1021
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,300
Stay in the woods where you belong.

1022
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,900
Watch out!

1023
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,600
You guys wanna party, do ya?
All right, then, let's party.

1024
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,600
- Mom!
- Kids!

1025
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,900
Penny, Lou, look out! Down!

1026
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,100
That's it! Verne, get everybody
out of here. I'll distract him.

1027
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,200
- Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
- Well, I'm the one he wants.

1028
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,000
Take care of your family, Verne.

1029
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,100
I intend to. The whole family.

1030
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,900
- There's got to be something we can do.
- There's no time.

1031
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,900
Hammy!

1032
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,900
Hey, Vincent. You were right.

1033
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,400
With a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

1034
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,300
RJ!

1035
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,800
Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!

1036
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,500
OK...

1037
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,400
I got the cookie.

1038
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,700
- That's the...
- The Depelter Turbo.

1039
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,400
Prepare for a lot of stinging.

1040
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, no! No, no! No, no! No!

1041
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,300
Ouch!

1042
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,200
That stung like I knew it would!

1043
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,300
- Yeah!
- All right!

1044
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,100
Good job, everybody. That's teamwork.

1045
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,800
Oome here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.

1046
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,300
Oh, thank you.

1047
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,000
And, Verne,
don't you ever fix this shell!

1048
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,300
Yeah. Glad it's working for ya.

1049
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,300
Take it off, give it back.

1050
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,800
Here we go, off to the
Rockies for you, Smoky.

1051
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,100
Now, you do realise
that was a Depelter Turbo?

1052
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,300
Officer, please. It was that Verminator.

1053
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,100
He sold it to me.
This has nothing to do with me.

1054
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,600
Hey, hey, it was in your yard.

1055
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,100
Your name's on the contract,
so tell it to the judge.

1056
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,600
- No! It's not my fault! Let go of me!
- Ma'am...

1057
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,200
I can't be arrested! I'm the president
of the homeowner's association!

1058
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,700
Take her down!

1059
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,900
She's getting away!

1060
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,400
- We got a twitcher! Watch it! Ma'am!
- Get her!

1061
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,600
- Stop that!
- Oan I get help over here?

1062
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,200
Somebody get a hold of her legs!

1063
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,700
- Play?
- Oh, no!

1064
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,000
No, no! No, no!

1065
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,500
High five, Hammy!

1066
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,400
- Yes!
- It worked!

1067
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,300
We did it!

1068
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,200
- Oh, yes!
- Stella!

1069
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,900
- Stella!
- Over here, Tiger.

1070
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,400
Oh, Stella.

1071
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,500
So this is the outdoor woods? I like it.

1072
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,600
Oome on, big boy.
You're coming with me.

1073
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,600
You know, RJ, just for the record,

1074
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,400
if you had told us that all
that food you were trying to get

1075
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,900
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.

1076
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,100
- Really?
- Yeah, that's what families do.

1077
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,100
They look out for each other.

1078
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:35,800
- I've never had anything like that.
- I know. But believe me, this...

1079
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,500
This is the gateway to the good life.

1080
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,500
Wish you would've told me that sooner.

1081
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,900
Well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.

1082
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,600
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?

1083
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,200
Oome here, come here.
I promised I wouldn't do this. OK.

1084
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,900
Welcome to the family!

1085
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,500
- Hey!
- Group hug!

1086
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,200
OK, OK.

1087
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,800
What a first week of spring.

1088
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,300
Wait a minute! That means
there's only 267 days left till winter.

1089
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,900
What are we gonna do for food?

1090
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,000
Yes, Hammy.

1091
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,800
I filled the log.

1092
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,400
- Jeepers!
- What...?

1093
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,200
Look, look! I found my nuts!

1094
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,300
That, my friends, is the object
of all human attention and devotion.

1095
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,000
- And they call it a TV.
- Wicked cool!

1096
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,100
Humans feel an inner need
to connect with the world around them.

1097
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,200
That is super-duper.

1098
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,500
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.

1099
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,900
Watching TV fulfils both needs
at the same time.

1100
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,400
Wow. Interesting.

1101
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,000
Oome on, kids. Family time there,
in front of the TV. Got your snack food?

1102
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,600
Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel!
Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".

1103
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
- I can't find the remote.
- Hey, Spikey, race ya!

1104
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,500
- Has anybody seen the remote?
- Dad, chill.

1105
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,000
I could do a little TV.

1106
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,600
Today's the day we find out
if the baby is gifted

1107
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,100
or if Saxon is really an alien.

1108
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,400
Like Khan in Star Trek II!

1109
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,200
The Genesis Project
was in the hands of the Enterprise,

1110
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,400
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!

1111
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,700
- Well, that was specific.
- I saw it on TNT, a retrospective.

1112
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,200
- Gummi Worm, anybody?
- Let me have one.

1113
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,000
Bucky, pass this to Lou.

1114
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,100
- Taste this.
- Don't you take that.

1115
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,500
- This is the perfect food.
- Fat-free cookies?

1116
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,000
Might as well be eating dirt.

1117
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,800
I've had dirt. I don't like dirt.
It tastes like dirt.

1118
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,400
The show is starting.

1119
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,100
Hang on a minute.

1120
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,100
I can't wait. I can't wait.

1121
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,900
Yes! Here we go.

1122
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,900
- Kind of anticlimactic.
- Shoot!
