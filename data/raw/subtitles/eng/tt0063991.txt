the fancy prices that you charge.

Hey, Brad, meet the birds!

175

This is the Edna bird,
and this is the Grace bird.

176

- No, I'm Grace.
- I'm Edna.

Hi, Brad. Pleased to meet you.

The famous Brad,
one of my oldest friends.

179
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,868
Are you really going to paint us, Brad?

180
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:11,288
Now, that depends, girls,
if you do the right thing.

181
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:14,291
You're a devil, Nat!
Isn't he a devil, Brad?

182
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:16,585
Yes, he's a devil, all right.

183

yourselves up in the stands, eh?

- Yeah.

I was only kidding you, Brad.

187
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:30,849
You know what women
are like about painters.

188

189

Well, you'll have to find another way
to get their clothes off.

190
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:38,231
- No! I've got plans!
- I've got a train to catch.

191
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:40,317
- Where to?
- Checkabarame.

192

No! Checkabarame!

Well, there's only one thing

I really couldn't. It's too much.

348
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,124
Four dollars. I insist.

349
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,753
Well, we'll make it two dollars,
and I'll say no more about it.

350
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,839

Hello, Godfrey.

354
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,119
Two dollars in advance
for a stolen chook.

355
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,124
This thieving's got to stop!
They're awake up, Miss Marley, copper.

356
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,502
Eggs, chooks. What else d'you take?

357
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,963
- Vegetables.
- It's bloody immoral!

358
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,550
- Didn't you like the chicken?
- That's beside the point.

359

- Me grandma.

360

You took some of my eggs, didn't you?

361
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:33,102
That police nark can put you in a home.
Do you know what a girl's home is?

362
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,520
Me grandma says she'll send me there

363

Never had one,
not one that would own up to it.

367
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,535
Doesn't the seafood you sell to the store
give you enough to live on?

368
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:53,622
Only pays for the groceries and the gin.
Me grandma knows the prices.

369
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,251
- I can't cheat her.
- What do you want to cheat her for?

370
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,921
So's I can hide money and save it.

371

372
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,134

I want you to promise
not to steal any more.

376
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,984

and I can't get away from here.

01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:16,697
So refreshing
to talk to such an intelligent woman.

682
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:21,035
Could I impose upon you
and call again some time, maybe?

683
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:22,912
Any time, Mr Kelly.

684
01:11:23,788 --> 01:11:26,665
Perhaps tomorrow, maybe?

685
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:30,503
Would you care to come to dinner?

686
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:35,341
Now, that's what I call real hospitality.
It would be a pleasure.

687
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:38,260
- Till then, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
- Yes, till then.

688
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:43,349
- Mr Kelly?
- Yes?

689
01:11:45,226 --> 01:11:47,978
- Your hat.
- Oh, well, I never!

691

we had a cup of tea.

694
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:35,825
And then, I got myself
an invite to dinner tomorrow.

695
01:12:37,493 --> 01:12:40,579
You know, a man could do himself
a bit of good there.

696
01:12:40,663 --> 01:12:44,750
Nice place, decent furniture,
good quality carpets.

697
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:49,088
You can always tell
what people are worth by their carpets.

698
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:53,509
Nice piece of jewellery she was
wearing, too, come to think of it.

699
01:12:53,592 --> 01:12:55,803
Then I ran into this old bag.

700
01:12:56,512 --> 01:12:59,974
And after that, I saw this girl.

701
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:04,979
You never listen to a word I say.

702
01:13:05,062 --> 01:13:07,648
- What girl?
- Ah, that woke you up!

703
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:10,526
A lovely creature, she was, beaut!

704
01:13:11,652 --> 01:13:16,031
Barefoot, regular kind of dress,
all legs and tits.

705
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:17,867
What happened?

706
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:20,202
She clapped eyes on me
and took off like a herd of turtles.

707
01:13:20,286 --> 01:13:24,331
I don't blame her, except there's
no girl who lives around here.

708
01:13:24,415 --> 01:13:28,627
- Well, I saw her.
- Wishful thinking. Mirage.

709
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,255
Move over, soldier.

710
01:13:35,843 --> 01:13:42,266
Now, Brad, you don't think
you could lend me, say, $300?

711
01:13:46,145 --> 01:13:47,938
You talk too much.

712
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,942

713
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:39,281
NAT: That's her!
That's the girl!

714
01:14:39,365 --> 01:14:43,827
- Hey, she got a wetting out there. Look...
- Leave her alone! Get in here!

715
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,375
I saw her on the beach yesterday,

716
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:55,839
and you told me it was a mirage.
Sly old dog! You charmer.

717
01:14:55,881 --> 01:14:58,550
Trying to put me off the scent,
and all the time you had a tart like that.

718
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:00,511
What do you mean, tart?
I'm painting her!

719
01:15:00,594 --> 01:15:02,554
- Yeah? That's your story.
- She's my model!

720
01:15:02,638 --> 01:15:05,557
Look, you bloody fool.
Take a look at these.

721
01:15:07,059 --> 01:15:09,895
In the nude, eh? Wow!

722
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:12,564
- Shut up!
- You artists.

723
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:16,902
And remember she's my model,
and I don't want anybody messing around.

724
01:15:17,903 --> 01:15:19,280
Okay, okay.

725
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:25,703
I got a bird of me own.

726

Superb!

728
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:34,753
Perhaps it could have been left
a little bit longer in the oven.

729
01:15:34,837 --> 01:15:37,256
Absolutely no. Cooked to the minute.

- And the marrow?

- Of course.

01:15:46,598 --> 01:15:48,726
Yes. Here we are.

01:15:49,143 --> 01:15:50,352

- Oh.

I can't work with him around.

I'll get rid of him.

745
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:57,878

wasting my time, eating my food.

What were you doing down
on the beach with my girl?

750
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:25,823
- Oh, Christmas.
- Sneaking about, corrupting a young girl!

751
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:29,368
Take your ugly mongrel and your ugly face
and get out of here!

752
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:30,786
Keep away from her!

that makes a man feel thoroughly at home.

- Nathaniel.

- Nathaniel.
- Yes.

01:18:14,913 --> 01:18:19,543
A woman of your taste and discrimination,
and, I suspect, a private income.

763
01:18:20,752 --> 01:18:24,214
Why do you choose
to live in a place like this?

764
01:18:24,256 --> 01:18:25,841
I was born here.

765
01:18:25,924 --> 01:18:29,136
When Mummy and Daddy died,
I just stayed on.

766
01:18:30,512 --> 01:18:31,930
Oh, thank you.

767
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:36,268
- But you could have lived elsewhere?
- Oh, yes.

768
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,020
- Oh, dear.
- That's all right.

769
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:39,354
Sorry.

770
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:42,149
No, my father left me an annuity.

771

right about you, Isabel.

- Oh, were you, Nat?
- Yes.

"Now, there's a woman who'd understand.

"There's a woman I'd trust
with my most innermost secrets."

to discuss money matters, I...

I thought I'd ask your advice about it.

sympathetic and a cultured woman,

- Prostitution! The girl's underage!

Get out of here!

Used her! Underage!

if that's what you want.

Nothing else.

and leave me alone!

You should have told her
I was painting you.

888
01:32:23,947 --> 01:32:27,659
- She'd only have taken the money.
- Yes, that's right.

889
01:32:27,743 --> 01:32:31,663
But you should've told her just the same.
It's all it ever was.

Gosh.

891
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,710

see reason somehow.

My mate got away with the lot of it.

It was an accident. All we have to do
is to tell them what happened.

The old lady was drunk,
fell over the cliff, broke her neck.

it hadn't happened before.

1031
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:06,042
