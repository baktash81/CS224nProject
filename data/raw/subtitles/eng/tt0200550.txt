1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,841
Why don't you, like,
ever realize the truth, Vince?

2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,719
I ate nine pies and a meatball hero
in one hour. That's a record.

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,432
It wasn't nine pies. It was eight.
You left two slices of mushroom
on the last tray.

4
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,603
- Violet?
- You guys, it was six pies. No hero.

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,982
I had to call the paramedics
to pump your stomach, and it was
three-and-a-halfyears ago.

6
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,861
- When are you guys gonna talk
about something else?
- When someone comes through that door...

7
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,740
and breaks the record, then we'll
stop talkin' about the subject.

8
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,159
Enjoy your pie, guys.

9
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,455
- It's the last one I'll ever serve.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

10
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,041
Quit it, Pete.
I'm not doin' that.

11
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,212
It's a tradition.
Sign the card.

12
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,015
I got it, folks.
I got the first autograph.

13
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:43,353
- Hey, Violet. All right!
- Violet's on her way to the wall.

14
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,358
That's 20 years
of girls leaving town.

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,738
That wall is jinxed.
I won't sit near that wall.

16
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,409
Let's hope you have better luck
than they did.

17
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,453
Ladies and gentlemen.

18
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,874
As you all know, my best friend,
Violet Sanford...

19
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,711
has decided...

20
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,715
has decided to leave
South Amboy tomorrow...

21
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,592
and travel the 42 miles
to New York City.

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,763
So... Okay, come on.
Bring her up here, girls.

23
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,641
- Come on, Violet. You gotta do it.
- No.

24
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,437
Come on, Vi.
Come on, everyone.

25
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,649
Hey, Violet, come on.
Come up here.

26
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,235
- Come on, honey.
- You guys!

27
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,366
Now, I think it's only fair
that tonight, on her last night here
with us in Jersey...

28
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,994
she grace us
with a little tune.

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,247
No way!

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,751
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,880
Kept thinkin' I could never
Live without you by my side

32
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,468
Then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong

33
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,347
And I grew strong
and I knew how to get along

34
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,266
No, not I
I will survive

35
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,521
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,734
I got all my life to live
I got all my love to give

37
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,987
I'll survive
I will survive

38
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,706
Look at this! Four people killed
last night in New York.

39
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,669
No reason at all.
Police have no leads.

40
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,090
- Tragic.
- Dad, what're you doin'?

41
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,801
I guess four out
of seven million ain't so bad.

42
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,471
Headlines should read,
"Millions Survive Night in New York."

43
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,640
Dad, stop. I get the point.
Here. Eat your eggs.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,435
They're not eggs. They're egg whites.
And I'd rather eat the carton.

45
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,856
You've already lost six pounds.
You're staying on this diet.
No fast food. No sausage.

46
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,318
Oh, and I bought you some
of those Lean Cuisine meals,
and I put 'em in the freezer.

47
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,988
- My mouth is watering already.
- And I lined your vitamins up
on the counter.

48
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,409
- I don't take vitamins.
- You do now. Just take them.

49
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,830
Oh, and I put fresh batteries
in the TV remote and set the
VCR timer so that you can watch...

50
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,207
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Am I missing something here?

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,086
I'm the parent. You're the child
running away to live by herself.

52
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,340
- I should be tellin' you how to live.
- Fine. How should I live?

53
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,175
Simple. Don't go.

54
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,472
I got that Irish Spring you like.
Oh. And, Dad, whatever you do...

55
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,184
- Don't do the laundry.
- Don't do the laundry.

56
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,937
Just leave it by the dryer, and I'll
do it when I come home every Sunday.

57
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,649
Oh, this is interesting. They say
the handrails on the subway system...

58
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,110
could one day lead
to an outbreak of plague.

59
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,653
Dad. Look.

60
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,117
You said I could be
whatever I wanna be.

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,745
I never said songwriter
in New York City. That's the exception.

62
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,748
You said anything,
and I believed you, so...

63
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,878
I'm not leavin' this house
without your support.

64
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,089
That's Gloria. What's it gonna be?

65
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,223
Violet, I saw how hard it was
for your mother when she didn't make it.

66
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,893
But if she was here,
she'd tell me to shut up...

67
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,604
wish you luck
and give you a big hug.

68
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,734
I'm not gonna give you a big hug,
and I'm not gonna wish you luck, but...

69
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,071
I am gonna shut up, sit here
with my coffee and pretend to be mad.

70
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,739
Is that okay?

71
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,624
This is the last of it.

72
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,504
- Honey, are you okay with that?
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.

73
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,131
Wait. All right.
That's everything.

74
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,094
- Let's hit it.
- Good luck.

75
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,057
There, I said it.

76
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,361
- I put some pepper spray in your purse.

77
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,447
Even if you're not sure,
just start spraying.

78
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,578
You know, you're not alone,
Mr Sanford.

79
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,124
Hey, you know, me and you
should have dinner sometime.

80
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,167
I'm lockin' the doors.

81
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,337
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

82
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,925
Kept thinkin 'I could never
live without you by my side

83
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,762
Oh, no, not I
I will survive

84
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,601
As long as I have love to give
I know I'll be alive

85
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,981
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

86
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,442
I will survive

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,111
I will survive

88
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,488
All right.
This is it.

89
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,249
What do you think?

90
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,627
I had a feeling
you were gonna need this.

91
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,715
- What are you doing?
- What? It's just some
emergency cash I saved up.

92
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,677
Honey, from the looks of this place,
I'd say this is our emergency.

93
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,013
Well, I'm not takin' it.

94
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,019
Fine, then.

95
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,105
I'm freezing your assets.

96
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,109
So, thanks for everything.
I'll call ya.

97
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,239
What is this?

98
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,995
It's just that all our lives,
you know, we always had one thing
in common, you and me.

99
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,040
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,335
It's like, you know we said
we wouldn't lose our virginity...

101
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,796
until we got married,
and that didn't happen.

102
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,801
And then we said we'd go
to college or junior college
or dental hygienist school, you know.

103
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,929
And that didn't happen.

104
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,059
We've never followed through
on a single thing, you know.

105
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,062
And I think that's
what makes us so special.

106
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,482
And this is why you're crying?

107
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,903
Well, a long time ago you told me
that you were gonna move to New York.

108
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:13,243
But everyone thought you'd just
stay in Jersey and get married
like me and Danny are gonna.

109
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,912
You know. And... And look at you.

110
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,749
No matter what,
you really did it right...

111
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,878
and I'm so proud of you.

112
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,530
Enough! You hear me?

113
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,908
You be quiet! Enough in there!

114
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,704
I don't like to

115
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,207
Be alone in the night

116
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,252
And I don't like to

117
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,672
Hear I'm wrong when I'm right

118
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,508
And I don't like to

119
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,054
Have the rain on my shoe

120
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,485
Hi. I'm Violet Sanford.
I just recently moved to New York...

121
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,488
and I was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists.

122
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,615
Violet, that is so cute.

123
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:38,161
Now, let me tell you about me.
My name is Wendy,
and I first moved to New York...

124
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,789
when I was 2 1 to be a dancer,
but I broke my big toe.

125
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,501
And then I got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the Peace Corps.

126
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,380
So for the last 1 6 years I been
raisin' my daughter all by myself.

127
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,092
And then two weeks ago
she tells me that she is a bisexual...

128
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,304
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet.

129
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,266
Now, tell me how I can
help you, please...

130
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,897
because I am dying
to make your dreams come true.

131
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,611
You don't take the tape
unless it comes from an agent...

132
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,697
but I can't get an agent
until I get published?

133
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,700
If we were to listen to that tape,
that would give you grounds...

134
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,327
for a copyright
or plagiarism lawsuit.

135
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,164
It's just a little tape.
All I want is someone to sing my songs.

136
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,542
Welcome to the music business.

137
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,843
- Good evening. I.D., please.
- Hi. Uh, sure.

138
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,594
Maybe

139
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,097
Find a way to

140
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,475
Make it back someday

141
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,520
- What can I get you?
- Let me ask you something.

142
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,232
I'm a songwriter. Is there someone
here I could talk to about my songs?

143
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,901
I've been a struggling
sax player for 1 2 years.

144
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,613
- What can I get you from the bar?
- Pepsi and some crackers.

145
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,161
Hey. How are you doing?

146
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,622
Then I hope there's
someone out there

147
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,125
Excuse me.
Who's that guy?

148
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,631
That would be Mr O'Donnell.

149
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,885
Mr O'Donnell.
He's the manager or something?

150
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,932
Yeah. He's the music manager. He's
in charge of, uh, finding bands and...

151
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,269
booking new talent.

152
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,565
Run away with my heart

153
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
Run away with my hope

154
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,074
Hey, where the hell were you,
O'Donnell?

155
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,785
I got 1 5 orders stacked up here
and nobody to run the grill.

156
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,955
Fifteen orders, Walt. Is that it?
Give me ten minutes, I'll catch us up.

157
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,208
Go on. Lie down. Relax.

158
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,587
You look tired.
We can talk about my raise later.

159
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,633
You think this is Australia?
There's no raise. I'm about to fire you.

160
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,642
Um, excuse me.
Mr O'Donnell?

161
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,937
- Yes.
- Mr O'Donnell. My name is
Violet Sanford. I'm a songwriter.

162
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,147
I just wanted to give this to you.

163
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,650
I know it's not the most
professional way to submit a tape.

164
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,487
- But this is all pretty new to me.
- It's pretty new to me too.

165
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:23,576
I just figured as the manager
of a club like this, you must know
every band on the East Coast.

166
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,912
The manager of this club.

167
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,631
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.
- Sure thing...

168
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,466
Mr O'Donnell.

169
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,140
I don't usually do this, Violet...

170
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,976
um, but I... I have
a feeling about you.

171
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:53,064
So I'm gonna take your tape,
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

172
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,607
Thank you.

173
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,361
I can't believe
how easy this was.

174
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,071
Neither can I.

175
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,325
Uh, you wanna go for, uh,
some coffee or something?

176
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,495
O'Donnell, who do I look like,
your goddam maid?

177
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,708
That's Mr O'Donnell,
but I'll let it slide this time.

178
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,047
I told you to take
your stuff home and wash it.
You got cow grease caked on the front.

179
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,550
Walt, I've warned you
about your attitude. You're fired.

180
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,681
Oh, you better not push me, kid.
I can find a hundred other
little punks like you...

181
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,017
who can burn a turkey burger.

182
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,730
Minimum wage punk.

183
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,320
Maybe we should start over.

184
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,448
I'm Kevin O'Donnell and...

185
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,659
I work the grill here
at the Fiji Mermaid Club.

186
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,705
I just made
a complete fool of myself.

187
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,251
I was gonna tell you.

188
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,214
I'm almost sure
I would have told you.

189
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,593
I just want you to know
I'm not following you home.

190
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,138
I'm just walking myself
26 blocks in the wrong direction.

191
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,059
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Did I mention how sorry I am?

192
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,603
I mean, not that it's all my fault.
You did throw yourseIf at me.

193
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:18,108
I didn't throw myseIf at you.
I was pretending to be sweet and
innocent so you'd give me a break.

194
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,735
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

195
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,738
Is there a reason we just walked
in a circle? Are you lost?

196
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,741
I'm not lost.
Somebody just moved my street.

197
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,038
You wanna... You wanna play a game?
I bet I can guess where you're from.

198
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm about to get out
my pepper spray.

199
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,712
I reckon you're from a big city.
And there's no sign from here...

200
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,715
of a belly button ring
or a tongue piercing.

201
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,385
- I gotta go with Chicago.
- Okay.

202
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,764
I've never had anyone stare
at my ass for haIf an hour,
so I'm gonna say good night.

203
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,517
And I'm hoping
you're gonna say it back.

204
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,644
Okay. I can take a hint.

205
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,109
- I really do know a lot of people
in the music business.
- You just don't give up, do ya?

206
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,237
Well, it was the sweet and
innocent thing. It did me in.

207
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,990
- Good night, Kevin.
- Just for the record...

208
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,493
I was only staring at your ass
for the first 15 minutes.

209
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,505
- William Morris.
- I don't mean to interrupt.
I just wanna leave this...

210
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,968
- I'll transfer.
William Morris. Please hold.
- It's a demo. I'm a songwriter.

211
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,305
William Morris.
I'll be right with you.

212
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,310
I just want to leave this
for Whitney or Mariah.

213
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,355
- I'm sure they're
personal friends of yours.
- Look.

214
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,192
I'm sure it sounds great in your shower,
but karaoke ended a haIf hour ago.

215
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,779
So, if you'd like to get your songs
heard, you're gonna have to take them
to an open mic night...

216
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,906
just like everyone else.

217
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,329
William Morris. I'll transfer.
You're not getting validated.

218
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,391
Caught in a mirror

219
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,812
Looking through
sympathetic eyes

220
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,440
Can I help you?

221
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,904
Yeah, hi. Um, I'm sure all your spaces
are filled for tonight.

222
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,908
I just wanted to come down
and check out what this whole
open mic thing was about.

223
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,037
I can squeeze you in in ten minutes.
A couple of my regulars,
they called in sick.

224
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:41,334
So, uh, I've got some spaces to fill.
I need you to sign your name in here
and get yourseIf ready.

225
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,673
Bathroom's around the corner
if you want to throw up.

226
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,344
Next up we have a young lady
named Violet Sanford.

227
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,683
So let's put our hands together
for New Jersey's own Violet Sanford!
Come on up, Violet.

228
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,352
Good! There we go. Yeah.

229
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,104
Yea, Violet!

230
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,651
Oh, oops.

231
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,740
- I'm a little nervous.
- So are we, honey.

232
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,703
Don't tease me, honey!
Sing!

233
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,913
Come on, give her a break.

234
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,043
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

235
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,519
Hello?

236
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,850
You gotta cheer up. You look like
somebody ran over your dog.

237
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,937
Hey, um, how mu...
how much is a slice of pie?

238
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,732
Oh, uh...

239
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,486
we happen to have
the best French apple in town.

240
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,155
And, uh, it's on the house.

241
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,702
- Shut up.
- You just have to pay attention.

242
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,578
- Okay?
- Twenty.

243
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:45,125
- Twenty says it's Pretty Woman.
- I will raise you ten
because it is Home Alone.

244
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,544
- Oh?
- You guys have to read the signs.

245
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,046
I call with
Saving Private Ryan.

246
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,217
- What?
- Let's flip this over,
and Miss Jennifer from Austin...

247
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,095
says her favourite movie is...

248
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,725
No way. There's no way!
You already saw this one.

249
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,269
- Oh, you are such a cheater.
- Hello.

250
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,355
A naked girl in army boots?
Easy play to call.

251
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,693
- Thank you.
- Those boots are kind of cute.

252
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,946
I may have to get me some of those.

253
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,410
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, Romero.
You gotta turn that up, baby.
That is the jam.

254
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,747
- Turn it up!
There you go, there you go.
- Oh, no.

255
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,375
- Girl, what are you doing?
- Remember this? Remember this?

256
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,712
- You better get it, girl.
- Watch my belly dancing.

257
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,059
- Do you know those girls?
- Oh, yeah. They're here
every morning around this time.

258
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,644
- Winding down.
- Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,481
- They have to, in their line of work.
- Are they hookers?

260
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,733
- I've got the power
- No.

261
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,740
- Coyotes.
- I've got the power

262
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,579
- All right.
- You guys?

263
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,625
You guys wanna see
what Al gave me for my birthday?

264
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,586
- This.
- You let him brand you?

265
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,464
- Isn't it cute?
- She let the man brand her.

266
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:18,051
Hey, check it out, ladies.
We each made 300 bucks tonight.

267
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,264
You sure you wanna be
goin' off to law school?

268
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,557
Hmm?

269
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,977
- Let's make a toast.
- Yeah.

270
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,523
To Zoe's last week as a Coyote.

271
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,026
- Oh.
- She's gonna be
impossible to replace.

272
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,864
I just wanna tell you both
that I will never, ever forget you.

273
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,758
Who's up there?

274
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,764
- I'm lookin' for the owner.
- Hey, come on down.
Bring a case with you.

275
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,940
- What are you doin' here?
- Uh, I-I'm gonna drop this case.
Where do you want me to put it?

276
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,528
- That depends. What do ya want?
- Well, I heard you might
need a... a new, uh...

277
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,448
That, uh, there might be
a job opening.

278
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,701
Put it right there.
Let me take a look at ya.

279
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,415
Let me guess.
Piedmont, North Dakota.

280
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,337
- South Amboy, New Jersey.
- Same thing.

281
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,172
You do any drugs?

282
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,010
Just coffee.
That's all I can afford right now.

283
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,306
- Let me see your arms.
- Are you kidding?

284
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,184
Do I look like I'm kidding?

285
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,355
Where'd you get
that scar on your wrist?

286
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,691
Pizza oven. It's a permanent burn
from pulling slices for four years.

287
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,861
That could be the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

288
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,823
- Um, what's next?
You want a urine sample?
- I prefer blood.

289
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,535
Look, are you really the owner? 'Cause
I've had a rough couple of days...

290
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,871
and so the last thing I need...

291
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,083
is some waitress on a power trip
wastin' my time.

292
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,972
You start Friday night. Be there
at 11:00. That's when we get busy.

293
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:35,897
- You're givin' me a job?
- I'm givin' you an audition.
Don't be late, Jersey girl.

294
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,903
I don't mean to press my luck,
but would you mind telling me
why you're hiring me?

295
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,323
Because the, um, average male...

296
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,493
is walking around with a toddler
inside of his pants.

297
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,621
A two-year-old, right there
inside his Dockers.

298
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,126
Men have two-year-old children in their
pants? That's why you're hiring me?

299
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,713
You look like a kindergarten teacher.
The kids'll love it.

300
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,549
Sorry I asked.

301
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:12,350
- I.D., please.
- Oh. I'm supposed to
start work here tonight.

302
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,978
Go ahead. Hey, you picked
a good night to start.

303
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:18,773
- It's a little slow right now,
but it should pick up.
- Okay.

304
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,401
Love is like a bomb
Baby, come on get it on

305
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,154
Livin' like a lover
with a radar phone

306
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,782
- Lookin' like a tramp
Like a video vamp
- You are hot!

307
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,368
Demolition woman
Can I be your man

308
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:39,294
Is this a church meeting
or is this a bar? Make some noise!

309
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,302
- Yeah!
- Come on

310
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,388
- Want it?
- Take a bottle

311
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,973
Shake it up

312
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,560
Break the bubble
Break it up

313
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,857
Pour some sugar on me
In the name of love

314
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,071
Poor some sugar on me
Come on, fire me up

315
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:12,035
- Pour your sugar on me
- I'm sorry. Sorry!

316
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,038
- I don't think so.
- Just in time.

317
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,084
- Where you goin' ?
- Uh, I was... I was looking for you.

318
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,835
Good. Let's go.

319
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,804
Listen, red light, yellow light
green light, go

320
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,848
Crazy little woman
in a one-man show

321
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,060
Mirror queen, mannequin
rhythm of love

322
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,604
- Really love your top.
- Thanks.

323
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:43,066
- I got it, um, on sale...
- Loosen up, uh, loosen up

324
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,488
You gotta squeeze a little
squeeze a little, tease a little more

325
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,032
Okay. Hair.

326
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,744
Let's see your moves.

327
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:00,000
That's Rachel.
You can learn a lot from her.

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,127
She just cut some guy's ponytail off.

329
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,046
Yeah. The court ordered her
to take anger management classes...

330
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,383
after she pummelled a customer
for grabbin' her ass.

331
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,970
He pressed charges.
I gave her a raise. Cheers.

332
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,931
Pour somme sugar on me

333
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,606
- There is only two rules, okay?
What do you want?
- Two beers.

334
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,900
- Don't date the customers.
- Okay.

335
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,279
Second, don't ever bring
your boyfriends into my bar.

336
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:33,575
As of this moment you are to appear
available, but never be available.

337
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,411
Break my rules,
I fire you on the spot.

338
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,497
- I... I understand.
- Jesus.

339
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,793
Hey! Hey, everybody!

340
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,087
Shut up!

341
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,258
I'd like you to meet
my new girl...

342
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,260
whose name is...

343
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,596
Violet.

344
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,140
Jersey.

345
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,227
Jersey is
an ex-kindergarten teacher...

346
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,648
and a former nun who just escaped
from the convent...

347
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,611
and is tired of being the only virgin
in New York City.

348
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,908
Would anyone like
to buy her a drink? Whoa!

349
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,752
- Come on, move! I'm workin' here.
- Sorry.

350
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,755
- Four margaritas with salt.
- All right.

351
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:33,009
Got tequila.
No mix, no salt, no blender.

352
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:36,596
- Okay, how about a black Russian?
- Got vodka, no Kahlúa.

353
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,182
- White wine.
- Never carry the stuff.

354
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:43,436
- So basically you have...
- Jim, Jack, Johnny Red,
Johnny Black and Jose.

355
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:48,316
All my favourite men.
You can have it any way you like,
as long as it's in a shot glass.

356
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,236
Okay, I-I'll take a beer.

357
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:54,614
- Four dollars.
- I'm Sammie, the Russian tease.

358
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:58,493
Violet, the Jersey nun.

359
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,204
That one's Rachel,
the New York bitch.

360
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:04,874
We all play our little parts,
only Rachel really is a bitch.

361
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,585
And I really am a tease.

362
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,046
Sammie, you can only be a tease
if you stop sleepin' around, babe.

363
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,590
Yeah. I keep forgetting that part.

364
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:17,762
I'lI have a shot of tequila, and don't
forget one for your pretty little self.

365
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:23,018
Oh, thanks, but ever since
I got really drunk on tequila,
I never really drink the stuff any more.

366
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:26,312
Hey, Lil! Your new girl's refusing
your good booze.

367
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,899
No! I was... I-I was suggesting
this gentleman buy me a double.

368
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,860
That's more like it.

369
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:40,368
I need eight shots. Four Canadian,
four South of the Border...

370
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:43,163
six-pack MGD
and a double-blended back.

371
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,750
- You want eight shots of what?
- I got it.

372
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,920
- Forty-six even, honey.
- Hey, Lil! Yo!

373
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:54,632
Your Jersey girl
can't quite keep up.

374
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,552
Hey, give me a Scotch and water.

375
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:01,473
- Okay, you got it.
- Lil, do we serve water
with our whisky?

376
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,726
Only water I serve's got
barley and hops in it!

377
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,812
Hey, everybody!
Do we serve water in this bar?

378
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:11,149
Hell no, H2O!
Hell no, H2O!

379
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,368
Hell no, H2O!
Hell no, H2O!

380
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,544
Sink or swim time, Jersey.
Get up there!

381
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,547
The devil's in the house
of the rising sun

382
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,467
I can't do that dance.

383
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,971
Granny, does your dog bite
No, child, no

384
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:43,598
Okay.

385
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,235
- Here's some cash.
You did okay for a nun.
- You're firing me?

386
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:58,988
I told you this was an audition.

387
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,700
Thanks for comin' in.
Now, get outta here.

388
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,495
Johnny said, Devil, just come on back
if you ever wanna try again

389
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,957
I done told you once, you son of a bitch
I'm the best there's ever been

390
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,960
He played fire on the mountain
Run, boy, run

391
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,754
Devil's in the house
of the risin' sun

392
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,172
Please!

393
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,717
- Back off!
- Hey!

394
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:22,846
Guys, guys, back off, back off! Look,
the way I see it, you got two choices.

395
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:26,850
You can start a fight here,
throw some punches, get a bloody nose,
make complete fools of yourselves...

396
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,103
or you can take this ten bucks
I got right here...

397
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,523
and buy, uh, these two pretty ladies
a round at the bar.

398
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,359
- Come on. What do you say?
- Let's go to the bar!

399
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,736
Party!

400
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,408
Hold it, Jersey. I'm just dyin'
to know where that came from.

401
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:48,079
Try serving a beer and pizza
on Monday nights when the Giants
play the Cowboys in November.

402
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,165
I'm giving you
a second audition.

403
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:54,461
There's a store at the corner of Sixth
and Hill. Be there at noon tomorrow.

404
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:57,922
I'm sending my fashion coordinator there
to take you shopping.

405
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,216
Now go home
before I change my mind.

406
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,970
Hey, and, Jersey. I'd be shocked
if you survive another night.

407
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,015
Granny, will your dog bite
No, child, no

408
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,600
Here we go!

409
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,770
And left, and right,
clog, clog, clog.

410
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,412
Oh, yeah!

411
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:33,750
So, uh, tell me more about this bar.
What kind of place is it?

412
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:38,088
It's... I don't know.
It's just a bar, Dad.

413
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,925
It's no big deal.
What are you eating?

414
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,804
One of those Lean Cuisine meals.
Rice and vegetables. Delicious.

415
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,016
Oh! See, they're good. Right?

416
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,518
Mmm. Yum.

417
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,523
So, yeah, well, what's going on
with your songwriting?

418
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,275
Songwriting. Oh!
He still has my tape.

419
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,361
Dance, dance, dance

420
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,409
Dance

421
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,869
I want my tape.

422
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,581
I had a feeling
you'd be back to see me.

423
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,960
- No dates in the kitchen, O'Donnell.
- I'm not staying.

424
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,129
I... I just want my tape.

425
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,964
Please.

426
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:26,761
- Thanks. Bye.
- Did you really write all those songs?

427
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,266
You listened to my tape?

428
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:35,770
No, of course not. I mean,
that would be invasion of privacy.

429
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,232
Baby, you're the right kind of love

430
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:43,111
Go ahead. Laugh it up.
'Cause there's nothing you can
say that's gonna bother me.

431
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,405
I'm just trying to tell you
I like your music.

432
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,533
I mean, do you always
take compliments so well?

433
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,954
- I gotta go.
- Wait! Uh...

434
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:56,624
I wanna see you again.
Where are you workin' ?

435
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,045
- I'm a Coyote.
- Good.

436
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,008
- And what the hell is that?
- If you want to see me again,
you'll figure it out.

437
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,013
That good? Uh-huh.

438
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,644
Sorry I'm late.
Al and I had a big fight.

439
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,564
And then we made up, twice.

440
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,361
You're the fashion coordinator?

441
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:28,656
LiI told me to get you something
that would make the kiddies drool.

442
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,950
Trust me, Violet.

443
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:33,787
I have a serious
shopping problem.

444
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,333
- It has a zipper in the crotch.
- Yeah.

445
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,628
Who would wear that in public?

446
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,880
- Actually, I have it in blue.
- You're unbelievable

447
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,090
Oh

448
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,886
You burden me
with your problems

449
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,222
By telling me more about mine

450
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,349
I'm always so concerned

451
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:57,185
With the way you say
you always have to stop

452
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,397
To think of us being one
is more than I ever know

453
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,608
The things you say

454
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,237
- You're unbelievable
- Oh

455
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,009
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

456
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:32,262
Seemingly lastless
Don't mean you can ask us

457
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,347
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self

458
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:37,350
And everything anger to brace yourself
with the grace of ease

459
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,979
- I know this world ain't what it seems
- It's unbelievable

460
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:47,027
You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies

461
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,196
- The things you say
- Oh, yeah!

462
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,742
- You're unbelievable
- Oh

463
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,206
Here I am! Yeah, baby!

464
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,377
You're unbelievable

465
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,342
Come on! Knock it...
Hey! Knock it off!

466
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,010
Lil! The ice!

467
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,349
How do you like that, huh?

468
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,897
There's every good reason
for hanging around

469
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,735
I don't know how you guys do it.
I can't have another drink.

470
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,863
Next time a guy buys you a shot...
That's on me, honey.

471
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:33,865
Chase it with a beer.

472
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,329
- I don't get it.
- I don't swallow it.

473
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,957
I just spit the shot back into
the beer bottle. They'll never know.

474
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,542
You try it.

475
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,296
Hey, just keep an eye
on your spittoon bottle.

476
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:51,758
Once Rachel served hers to Lou
by accident. Huge drama.

477
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,929
Cammie, I think I just fell
in love with you.

478
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:58,348
Oh, Violet!
I'm not a lesbian.

479
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,810
I've played in the minors,
but never went pro.

480
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,188
- Th-That's not what I meant.
- What are you doing?

481
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:09,192
Lil's starin' straight at you. Come on.
Grab this guy. Make yourseIf look busy.

482
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:13,196
- Hi. You look like
you could use a shot.
- No, I'm waiting on Lil.

483
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:17,826
Sorry. It's a no parking zone. If you
wanna sit here, you gotta order a drink.

484
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,704
- Okay. Give me a glass of water.
- Okay.

485
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,040
- He just ordered water.
- Yeah.

486
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,126
You know what to do.

487
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:33,383
T-Testing. Um, hey, everybody,
this guy just ordered water.

488
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,553
Do we serve water in our bar?

489
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,264
Hell no, H20!
Hell no, H2O!

490
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,353
Jersey! No!

491
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,106
It's okay, Lil!
Nobody orders water in your bar!

492
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,526
He can order whatever he wants.
He's the fire marshal.

493
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:57,782
- Hey, Mike, I'm so sorry. She's new.
- I'm okay. Let's step outside.

494
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,371
- Party
- Nice knowing you, Jersey.

495
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,583
- Get naked
- Come on, you guys! Let me hear you!

496
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,713
You okay?

497
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,800
- Who am I kidding? I can't do this.
- Of course you can.

498
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,013
Now cheer up because there's a really
cute guy at the bar asking for you.

499
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,515
Somebody's asking for me?

500
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,060
He says his name
is Mr O'Donnell.

501
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,606
He's hot.

502
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:40,909
Jersey. The fire marshal
threatened to shut me down.

503
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:44,537
- He let me go with a $250 fine.
- Lil, I'm really sorry...

504
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:47,957
I'll make you a deal. You figure out
a way to make me 250 tonight...

505
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,418
I'll let you come back tomorrow.

506
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:52,712
Great.

507
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,466
So much for sweet and innocent.

508
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:01,429
- So, you found me.
- Some guys at work told me
where I could, uh, look for Coyotes.

509
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:05,517
Well, take a good look,
because tonight's my last night.
I think I'm gonna get fired.

510
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,770
- Why?
- 'Cause I have to make $250
in two hours.

511
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,064
It's completely impossible.

512
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,944
Here's nine dollars,
just to get you started. Okay?

513
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:18,738
I always like to help
a friend in need.

514
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,078
Why are you looking at me like that?

515
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,997
Kevin, I don't want your money.

516
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,294
All right, uh, listen up. Ladies.

517
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,298
The bidding will start at $25
for one night only.

518
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,386
You get this purebred,
house broken...

519
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,889
fully trained, yowling stud.

520
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,768
- No way.
- That's pretty cheap.

521
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,940
- Violet, what are you doing?
- You said you wanted to help,
so, turn around, sir...

522
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,151
let 'em take a look at ya.

523
00:37:56,818 --> 00:38:01,031
- Why... Why are you doing this to me?
- It's payback time, Mr O'Donnell.

524
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:03,908
Now, turn around.

525
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,247
- No, God, no. Don't... Don't do this.
- Go on. Show 'em what you got.

526
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,459
- Are you in?
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna do this?

527
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:16,421
- All right, ladies.
What'll you give me?
- I've got twenty bucks.

528
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,883
I've got...
I've got $25 right here.

529
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,634
Make it 35!

530
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,388
Thirty-five dollars!

531
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,934
- Forty dollars!
- Get... What are you doing?
- Forty dollars!

532
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,479
- Come on, girls, fifty?
- Fifty!

533
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:36,066
- Sixty-one dollars.
- I've got 70.

534
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,277
- Come on, girls. Seventy-five?
- Seventy-five dollars!

535
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:42,989
Eighty dollars! Eighty dollars!
Come on, girls. Do I hear 85?

536
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,743
Ninety! Ninety-five dollars!

537
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:50,121
- One hundred dollars, baby!
- One hundred dollars.

538
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:55,335
That's it.
You wanna come home with Mama?

539
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,253
Whoa! Nice!

540
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,674
Oh, yeah!

541
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,176
That's my boy.

542
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,971
- Oh, yeah. Shake it, shake it.
- $125 back here!

543
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,599
$140, right here.
Come on, come on.

544
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,983
My goodness, girls, come on.
One fifty and you'lI see the butt.

545
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,945
Come on, girls.
You can do better than this.

546
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,239
- One seventy-five.
- Yeah!

547
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,034
There we go.
Two hundred dollars!

548
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:36,459
- You've got 215 right here!
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

549
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,211
Sold, for $250!

550
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,343
- No!
- Come on up, honey. He's yours.

551
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,182
- Damn you.
- The blonde would have gone 275.

552
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,441
- Come with me.
- You're gonna owe me
big-time for this one.

553
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,317
That's 250 even.

554
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:16,374
I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya one day

555
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,753
Maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya

556
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,380
I'll meet ya
I'll meet ya

557
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,674
Better close out, girls.

558
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:27,010
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

559
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,721
What... What does
"Coyote Ugly" mean?

560
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,560
Did you ever wake up sober
after a one-night stand...

561
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,730
and the person you're next to is layin'
on your arm, and they're so ugly...

562
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,232
you'd rather chew off
your arm than risk wakin' them?

563
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:44,027
- That's coyote ugly.
- My God.
- Let's go, ladies.

564
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,571
Well, why would you name
your bar after something like that?

565
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:49,908
- Well, because "Cheers" was taken.
- All right, come on.

566
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,826
Cabs are out front.

567
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,079
- You're rich, Jersey.
- See ya.

568
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,955
Have a good night.

569
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:01,252
The woman who purchased me
is named Sandy Rosenfeld,
a divorcee with three grown kids...

570
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:05,173
a passion for long walks
and short-haired hunting dogs
and Italian opera.

571
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:08,843
Her ex-husband is a CPA.
Her favourite artist is van Gogh...

572
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:14,265
and her New Year's resolution is to lose
15 pounds and to see Barbra in concert.

573
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,644
Okay. I owe you.
What do you want?

574
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:24,317
Well, it's, uh, 3:30 in the morning.
I want what every man wants.

575
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,695
Breakfast.

576
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,824
And that's it? I go to breakfast
with you, and we're even?

577
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,952
No. We're not even close to even,
because I danced on a bar...

578
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,996
I took off my shirt,
and I unzipped my pants.

579
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:40,083
Okay. Let's make a deal.
Breakfast and lunch.

580
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:44,796
- Breakfast, lunch and two dinners.
- That's four dates!

581
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,216
Yep. Which would make it the second
longest relationship I've ever had.

582
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:49,968
Get in the car.

583
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:56,141
Oh, I hate to spoil your evening, but it
looks like we're not gonna go anywhere.

584
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,103
Oh, my God.

585
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,984
It's hard to find parking
in New York.

586
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,361
You ever eaten Turkish?
This is the place.

587
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:11,489
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi, Kevin. How are you?

588
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,908
- Four of the regular?
- Sure, yeah. Hey.

589
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:17,787
- Hey, Kevin.
- How you doin', man?
- How are you, buddy?

590
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:20,498
Here it is, man.
Flown in from Miami.

591
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,209
- Check out the merchandise.
- Hey, man, no. I trust you.

592
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,211
All right, all right.

593
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,218
Look, uh, I don't know
what you're into, but...

594
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:36,973
The Amazing Spider-Man,
number 129, mint condition.

595
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,393
- Worth a thousand bucks.
- A comic book.

596
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,855
No, it's not just a comic book.
This is the first appearance
of the Punisher.

597
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:46,358
This is the holy grail
of comic books.

598
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:49,235
- You collect comic books.
That's so cute.
- Yeah.

599
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:52,155
It's not cute.
It's very rugged and manly.

600
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:56,826
- It's just a bit geeky. Huh?
- I think it's sweet.

601
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:04,167
So, do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car?

602
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,045
What can I say?
I'm a romantic.

603
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,297
You think this is romantic?

604
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,884
Well, you may not be feeling it now,
but I think one day...

605
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:16,388
you'll be on stage singing
a song about this very night.

606
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:19,683
"When We Were Downwind
From a Trash Barge."

607
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,310
Yeah. Catchy title.
Hum a few bars.

608
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:27,857
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm a songwriter, not a singer.

609
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:30,276
When I get on stage,
I freeze.

610
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:34,030
What if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice?

611
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:37,701
Okay. If the fate of the free
world depended on me singing...

612
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,077
maybe.

613
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:42,789
All I ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark...

614
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,625
and hear someone great
singing my songs.

615
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:49,337
I wanna be the one
who writes the music.

616
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:54,509
I remember the first time
my mother played me
"Bridge Over Troubled Water"...

617
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:56,594
by Simon and Garfunkel.

618
00:43:57,887 --> 00:44:00,515
I remember exactly
what she was wearing.

619
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:04,811
I remember exactly how her hair smelled.
And I remember exactly how I felt.

620
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,481
And every time
I hear that song...

621
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,444
I remember exactly
what she was wearing...

622
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:15,071
and exactly
how her hair smelled...

623
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:17,198
and exactly how I felt.

624
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:20,744
'Cause the great songs last forever.

625
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:24,622
- So, what's the problem?
- Well...

626
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:28,209
now they're telling me
the only way to get my songs heard...

627
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:30,670
is to go out there
and sing 'em myself.

628
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,090
So we're gonna have to try and fix
this little problem straight away.

629
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:39,179
- And how do you propose we do that?
- Well, is there any place
you feel comfortable singing?

630
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,265
- The shower.
- We'll start there.

631
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,144
I mean, I don't care how long
it takes, how many hours
we have to spend in that shower.

632
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,606
- Let's get to it.
- Okay. Before we hit the showers...

633
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,400
maybe you could tell me
a little something about yourself.

634
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,694
Oh, really?
What do you wanna know?

635
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,821
What part of Australia
are you from?

636
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:59,783
I'm from all over.
My family moved around a lot.

637
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:03,328
- So the rest of your family
doesn't live in New York?
- Do you always ask this many questions?

638
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,663
Do you always dodge
this many questions?

639
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,958
You can at least tell me
where you got all the moves
you pulled on the bar tonight.

640
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:12,170
Well, if I told you,
I'd... I'd have to kill you.

641
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,924
- That's original.
- Oh.

642
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,843
The sun's coming up.
We're gonna be late.

643
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:20,804
Late? Late for what?

644
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,558
This is incredible.

645
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,855
- Look at that fish!
- All right. Put this on.
You're gonna need it.

646
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:35,610
- Why? What are you talking about?
- You're gonna help me unload
the next bin.

647
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:38,571
- You're joking, right?
- No. It's not that bad, Vi.

648
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:41,700
- I do it all the time.
- Exactly how many jobs do you have?

649
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,494
Tuesday through Saturday,
I'm at the club.

650
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:47,372
Sunday and Monday
I park cars at the Plaza.

651
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,333
I've been a telemarketer.
Would you like to switch to AT&T?

652
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:54,129
And for six terrifying hours
I delivered phone books in Queens.

653
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,882
Don't forget your
extensive work in fish.

654
00:45:57,882 --> 00:46:00,135
This is an expensive city,
and these guys pay cash.

655
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:03,805
I don't care if they pay in lobster. I'm
not sticking my hands in that fishy bin.

656
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:06,474
I was gonna split the money with you.

657
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,768
- A hundred bucks apiece.
- A hundred bucks?

658
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:12,063
- Wait, wait. Why-Why didn't you say so?
- Thanks, Dan.
- Wait.

659
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:14,357
- You're not ready, are you?
- No.
- Fifty bucks. Twenty-five.

660
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:17,068
- Ten.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Ready? Huh?

661
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:18,987
That is disgusting!

662
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:23,533
Hey, you'll hurt their feelings. Okay.
Just on top of the other fish. Yeah.

663
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:30,540
So, I know
I just met you a few days ago.
There's something I have to tell you.

664
00:46:33,626 --> 00:46:35,628
You smell really bad.

665
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:42,594
Well, so do you. I mean,
I was gonna kiss you goodbye,
but, um, I thought I might gag.

666
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,013
You're a real charmer.

667
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,435
- Okay. Good night.
- Good morning.

668
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:12,665
Don't look at me like that.

669
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:19,297
Spend it.

670
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,766
- What are you doing here?
- I changed my mind about this kiss.

671
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:33,770
I think we should give it a shot.

672
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,363
Well, have a nice day.

673
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,536
"Have a nice day"?

674
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,331
Yeah. I panicked.
I didn't know what else to say.

675
00:47:57,168 --> 00:47:58,962
Have a nice day.

676
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,843
I wanna get in.
I wanna dance with my friend.

677
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:07,679
All right. Back of the line over here.
Back of the line.

678
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,264
Yeah! Whoa!

679
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:27,866
Whoo!

680
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:33,788
- Yeah, I like it!
- Yeah!

681
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:38,126
- Hey, baby!
- Make a hole. Make a hole!
Lou, nobody...

682
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:41,546
- Shit, the cops are here.
- Nobody else gets in here.
Look at this place.

683
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:45,383
Hey, Lil. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do here.
You're 50 people over max.

684
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:47,969
Try to shut us down,
they'll tear the place apart. Come on.

685
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,139
Let's go outside and talk.
I'll take care of it.

686
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:52,640
Hey! Hey!

687
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:56,686
This is not a gas pump, son!

688
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,939
Wait your turn!

689
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,488
- Hey, no pictures, man!
- Hey, I'm a reporter from The Voice.

690
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:07,822
Yeah!

691
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,657
Whoo!

692
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:13,453
What are you doing? Hey!

693
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,497
- Put me down!
- Hey!

694
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:16,831
- Put me down!
- Cammie!

695
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:19,250
- Help!
- Come on! Let her go!

696
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,919
Rachel, help!

697
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:24,089
Come on, boys!
Come on! Break it up!

698
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:29,386
- Lou, where's Rachel and Cammie?
- I don't know!

699
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:34,974
Let me go!

700
00:49:50,615 --> 00:49:53,493
Jersey, they're tearing
this place apart!

701
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:04,546
- Rachel! Rachel!
- One way or another I'm gonna find ya

702
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:08,967
- I'm gonna get ya, get ya
ge tya, get ya
- Let me go!

703
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,594
One way or another
I'm gonna get ya

704
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:14,472
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
get ya, get ya

705
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:17,100
One way or another
I'm gonna see ya

706
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:21,229
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya, one day

707
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:23,773
Maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya

708
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:26,818
I'll meet ya, I'll meet ya

709
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,194
I will

710
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:31,197
Drive past your house

711
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,452
And if the lights are all out

712
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,498
- I'lI see who's around
- Ooh!

713
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,087
One way or another

714
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:48,131
I'm gonna find ya

715
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:51,134
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
get ya, get ya, one way

716
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:54,512
- I'm talking about that!
- Or another I'm gonna win ya

717
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:56,514
I'm gonna get ya, I'll get ya

718
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:59,142
One way or another
I'm gonna see ya

719
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:02,645
- Yeah!
- I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya

720
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:04,773
One day, maybe next week

721
00:51:04,856 --> 00:51:07,359
- I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya
- Yeah!

722
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,861
- Great. Yeah.
- Last call, Lil.

723
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:13,448
- Start clearin' 'em out.
- You got it.

724
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:15,367
Let's go.

725
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,454
One way or another
I'm gonna lose ya

726
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:24,668
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip

727
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:27,337
Or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya

728
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,756
- Ya-hoo!
- One way or another

729
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:35,428
I'm gonna lose ya, I'm gonna trick ya
trick ya, trick ya, trick ya

730
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:41,935
Did you see their faces?
I mean, wow.

731
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:45,897
They alI wanted you, honey.
Even the girls.

732
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,817
Not a dry seat in the house.

733
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:52,278
You guys, that was, like,
a one-time performance...

734
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:55,073
- Hmm?
- That I have to repeat,
like, every night.

735
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,491
Ya-hoo!

736
00:51:57,325 --> 00:52:01,162
She sang along with a jukebox.
Let's not start polishing a Grammy.

737
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:04,374
Oh, come on, Rach.
She saved your butt. Admit it.

738
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:08,586
No. She saved me from kicking the shit
out of a couple of drunks.

739
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:11,673
- That's it.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that was good.

740
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:14,843
- Where you goin' ?
- I don't know.

741
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:17,262
I gotta walk or celebrate or...

742
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:20,640
Ugh, pass out or something.

743
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,768
Hey, ladies and gent...

744
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:27,814
how about a big round of applause
for the singing Coyote from Jersey!

745
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:31,234
- So I'm a Coyote?
- Five nights a week.

746
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,539
Hey, what is it?
What's wrong?

747
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,167
Why would anything
be wrong?

748
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:51,546
Um, you called me in the middle of the
night and said there was an emergency.

749
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:56,259
What was that for?

750
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:59,512
I had a good night.
I wanted a good-night kiss.

751
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:02,223
Well, wait a second.
Where are you going?

752
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:04,642
Have a nice day,
Mr O'Donnell.

753
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:07,103
"Have a nice day"?

754
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,820
Right kind of wrong

755
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,076
Right kind of wrong

756
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:24,329
We likes to party
La-la-di-da-di

757
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,709
On the East Coast
is the place to be

758
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,302
We likes to party
La-la-di-da-di

759
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:41,096
Lovin' you

760
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:45,517
- We likes to party
- Isn't really something I should do

761
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:50,021
I should try to be strong

762
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:55,193
Isn't really something
I should do

763
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:00,782
Shouldn't want to spend
my time with you

764
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:04,786
I should try to be strong

765
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:09,749
But, baby,
you're the right kind of wrong

766
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:14,713
Baby, you're the right kind
of wrong

767
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,135
What's going on?
Why do we need my guitar?

768
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:23,054
You'll find out soon enough.
No. This way.

769
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:25,515
Okay, now there's a seat.

770
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:30,145
Just there. Uh-huh?
Okay?

771
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,231
Take a look.

772
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:36,109
Your fans wanna hear you sing.

773
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:41,197
I told you. I-I can't sing my own songs.
I never could.

774
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,702
Well, that's too bad, because they've
requested to hear your songs.

775
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,873
Be gentle on the keyboard.
I borrowed it from the club.

776
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,918
You did all this
just to help me sing?

777
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:58,006
I thought maybe we could cure that
stage fright I've heard so much about.

778
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,133
Kevin, I wish you could.

779
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,969
Come on. Let me try.

780
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:05,805
Tell me what it feels like.

781
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,479
You really wanna know?

782
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:14,898
Yeah.

783
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,277
You asked for it.

784
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:21,738
What are you doing?

785
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:25,492
The only way I can show you...

786
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,164
is to make you...

787
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,249
really nervous.

788
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:41,007
The first thing that happens...

789
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,052
is my heart starts to race.

790
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,018
Good.

791
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:54,020
Racing heart. Yep.

792
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:57,107
- Got it.
- And then...

793
00:55:57,315 --> 00:55:59,693
my entire body starts shaking.

794
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:07,659
Shaking body.
I'm... I'm getting that. Yeah.

795
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,036
And...

796
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,666
then everything gets a bit...

797
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:19,546
cloudy.

798
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,675
Clouds are definitely
rolling in.

799
00:56:27,178 --> 00:56:28,930
Then I start...

800
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:31,516
losing control.

801
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:35,854
Well, how long
does this usually last?

802
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:38,815
Oh, it's been known
to last all night.

803
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:43,737
- That must be horrible.
- It's excruciating.

804
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:34,120
I think that audience got more
than they paid for, really.

805
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:40,627
What's "L.M.S." stand for?

806
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,671
Lynn Marie Sanford.

807
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:45,340
It was my mom's guitar.

808
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,218
She died five years ago.

809
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,262
She moved to New York to be
a singer when she was my age.

810
00:57:51,262 --> 00:57:53,848
She came pretty close
to the big time.

811
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:55,809
Well, what happened?

812
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:58,853
She hated the stage.

813
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,273
She said it was
the scariest place in the world.

814
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:04,442
Sounds familiar.

815
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,532
You really want me to sing?

816
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,910
Just tell me
what I have to do.

817
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:23,378
Disappear.

818
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,132
All right. No problem.

819
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:55,076
I don't like to

820
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:58,288
Be alone in the night

821
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,124
I don't like to

822
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,461
Hear I'm wrong
when I'm right

823
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:07,172
And I don't like to

824
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,342
Have the rain on my shoes

825
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,177
But I do love you

826
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:17,515
But I do love

827
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:20,477
You

828
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:25,065
I don't like to

829
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:28,276
See a sky painted grey

830
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:31,279
And I don't like when

831
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:34,532
Nothing's going my way

832
00:59:35,116 --> 00:59:38,661
And I don't like to be
the one with the blues but I do...

833
00:59:40,872 --> 00:59:43,708
If you wanna write a song, if you want
to be like a serious songwriter...

834
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45,669
you simply gotta go
with the Mac.

835
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:49,172
Laptop. You can lay your tracks down
on a blank CD, and you're done.

836
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:51,883
Do you...
Do you have a payment plan?

837
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,844
The way you lay your head upon

838
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:58,139
- Play ball! Let's go!
- My shoulder when you sleep

839
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:00,809
Come on, Cammie!

840
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,480
Oh, I do

841
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:10,777
And I don't like to

842
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:13,363
Hear I'm wrong when I'm right

843
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:15,407
And I don't like to

844
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,202
Have the rain on my shoes

845
01:00:19,202 --> 01:00:21,037
But I do love you

846
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:32,090
Jeez! What are you doing?

847
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:37,095
What are you,
brain damaged?

848
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:40,849
You know what kind of maniacs
we got driving through here?
They don't stop for nothin'.

849
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:43,601
- Whose boat?
- I borrowed it from a friend.

850
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,729
Yeah?
Looks like a guy's car to me.

851
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:50,275
- How can you tell?
- I've been staring at cars
every day for the last 16 years.

852
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:53,361
- Who is he?
- He's a friend.

853
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:56,239
Look, I brought you a turkey sandwich,
no mayo, extra sprouts.

854
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:58,074
Thank you. Great.

855
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:01,036
I'm starving'.
Now tell me about this bar.

856
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,497
Is it a bunch of bankers
havin' martinis after work?

857
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:06,833
I gotta go. Look.
I love you.

858
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,085
I love you too. Be careful.

859
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:12,464
Hey, do I come to your office
and honk? Come on!

860
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:21,431
I got you a gig. There's this
club where a lot of music people
hang out called The Elbow Room.

861
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:26,603
My friend's the manager.
He owes me a favour,
and you're it, next Thursday night.

862
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,522
Are you forgetting
about the stage fright?

863
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,608
Uh, what about the bar?

864
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:35,653
Come on, Kevin. All I do
is sing along with the jukebox.

865
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:40,200
See? You're making progress.
A few more nights at my place,
and you'll be cured.

866
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:44,454
I hate to burst your bubble,
but I'll never be cured. It's genetic.

867
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:48,416
Stage fright DNA.
Yes, I saw that on ER last week.

868
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,921
Okay. Laugh all you want, but my mom
couldn't do it, and neither can I.

869
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:55,465
So was your mother afraid
to try?

870
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:59,302
Look, I just wanna be a songwriter.
Why won't you give up on this?

871
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:02,847
Because I've been giving up
on people my entire life,
and it's a nasty little habit.

872
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:05,684
So, you're gonna sing
at the club, or I'll...

873
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:07,435
Or you'll what?

874
01:02:08,311 --> 01:02:10,522
I'll never kiss you again.

875
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:13,316
That sounds like a threat,
Mr O'Donnell.

876
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:15,402
Well, let's just say...

877
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:18,488
it's gonna be quite a long,
cold winter.

878
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,032
That's supposed to convince me?

879
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:24,369
It's working, isn't it?
Your knees are getting weak.

880
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:27,205
- I'lI think about it.
- Try again.

881
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:30,000
Uh, I'lI see
if I can get off work.

882
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,043
You're gettin' warmer.

883
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,629
All right. You win. I'll do it.

884
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:37,590
Oh, I love winning.

885
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,969
Pour some sugar on me

886
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:46,808
- Pour your sugar on me
- Hey, we have a special treat...

887
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,060
for you tonight,
boys and girls.

888
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,646
- Look who dropped by for a visit.
- Pour some sugar on me

889
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:53,898
- Get up there, Zoe!
- No!

890
01:02:54,315 --> 01:02:58,486
I'm a paying customer tonight.
I have class in the morning.
What are you doing?

891
01:02:58,486 --> 01:03:00,530
- Come on, Zoe!
- No!

892
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,616
Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!

893
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:11,458
- Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!
- Time to get wet, girls. Whoo!

894
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:17,255
Well, I'm packin' up my game
and I'm gonna head out West

895
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:20,091
Where real women come equipped
with scripts and fake breasts

896
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:22,969
Find a nest in the hills
Chill like Flynt

897
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:26,222
Buy an old drop top
Find a spot to pimp

898
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:29,017
- Well, I'm Kid Rock
and I'm the real McCoy
- Who wants some of this?

899
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:32,896
And I'm headed out West, sucker
because I wanna be a cowboy, baby

900
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:37,734
With the top let back
and the sunshine shinin'

901
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,361
Cowboy, baby

902
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,448
Ride at night
'cause I sleep all day

903
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:47,285
- Excuse me.
Does Violet Sanford work here?
- Yeah, she's on the bar.

904
01:03:47,285 --> 01:03:49,287
- She's on what?
- She's on the bar.

905
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:51,748
- What do you guys say?
- Yeah!

906
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:57,796
Yeah, Kid Rock
You can call me Tex

907
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:00,799
Rollin' sunset women
with a bottle of Beck's

908
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:03,009
Seen a slimmy in a 'vette
Rolled down my glass

909
01:04:03,009 --> 01:04:06,471
And said, "Yeah, this dick's
fittin' right in your ass"

910
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:09,557
I'm flickin' my Bic
up and down that coast and

911
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:12,227
- Keep on truckin'
till it falls into motion
- Dad! Wait!

912
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,230
- Cowboy
- Dad, it's not as bad as it looks.

913
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:20,235
- And the sunshine shinin'
- Daddy, it's not as bad as it looks.

914
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:21,778
I just sing here every night.

915
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:24,572
- People come here to see me.
- Cowboy!

916
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:29,160
- Say something!
- The guys are putting
your picture up in their booths!

917
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:32,789
- I gotta go, get up early.
- Dad, it's just a bar.

918
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:36,501
- You can trust me.
- But you're my daughter.

919
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:40,755
I can smell a pig
from a mile away

920
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:42,632
Cowboy

921
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:46,845
With the top let back
and the sunshine shinin'

922
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:48,221
Cowboy

923
01:04:50,181 --> 01:04:51,558
Cowboy

924
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,646
Hi, you've reached Bill Sanford.

925
01:04:56,855 --> 01:04:59,941
Please leave a message
when you hear the beep.

926
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,279
Dad, you can't avoid me
for the rest of your life.

927
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:08,616
I have to come over and do your laundry.
We both know you're
running out of clean shirts.

928
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:11,745
I bet the one you're wearing
stinks pretty bad.

929
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,665
I'm not gonna apologize
because...

930
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:17,751
that would mean
I'm doing something wrong.

931
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:20,045
And I'm not sure I am, so...

932
01:05:20,795 --> 01:05:23,173
I'm playing at a club tonight.

933
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:24,758
A real club.

934
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,843
Someone important
could hear my song...

935
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:28,887
and next month somebody
might be singing it on the radio.

936
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,556
- So wish me good luck.
- Good luck.

937
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:33,308
Anyway, um...

938
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:36,102
I'll call you
and tell you how it goes.

939
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:39,481
Take care of yourself, old man.

940
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:44,235
Old man.

941
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:48,281
All right. You should be dancing
on the floor! I wanna see your bras!

942
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:49,866
Ow!

943
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:57,665
- Well, my baby and me
went out late Saturday night
- All right.

944
01:05:57,832 --> 01:06:01,336
I had my hair piled high and
my baby she looked so right

945
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:05,590
Well, pick you up at 10:00
Got to have you home by 2:00

946
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,009
Mama, don't know
what I catched off of you

947
01:06:08,009 --> 01:06:11,638
But that's all right 'cause
we're looking as cool as can be

948
01:06:11,846 --> 01:06:15,475
Is this the greatest party
we've ever been to or what, man?

949
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:21,272
Lil, I can only stay two hours.

950
01:06:21,272 --> 01:06:24,734
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta leave early tonight, remember?

951
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,611
- Bourbon.
- Why?

952
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,657
Maybe you haven't noticed all
the bodies you had to crawl over
to get in here tonight.

953
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:33,284
- Lil, I told you I gotta leave
by 1 0:30 no matter what.
- Four!

954
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:35,578
- Here.
- Got it. I got it.

955
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,455
Seven.

956
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:39,666
That I love you, yeah

957
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:43,378
Hit me

958
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:49,384
- Here you go.
- What are you doing?

959
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:53,013
I gotta go. It's haIf past.
Can you have Lou call me a cab?

960
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:56,433
Listen, Jersey. You're not
going anywhere. Not tonight.
This place is out of control.

961
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,601
But, Lil, I told you.
I'm only working two hours...

962
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:01,021
You wanna sing?
Sing for them.

963
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:04,399
These people dragged
their asses out here to see us.

964
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:08,111
This is New York, and there's a line
halfway around the block.

965
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:10,321
That's something, Jersey,
whether you believe it or not.

966
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:13,491
- Last night a little dancer
came dancing to my door
- And if I go?

967
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:17,537
- If you were going,
you would have left by now.
- Last night a little angel

968
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:19,122
And tonight

969
01:07:19,914 --> 01:07:22,709
- Where are you?
- Lil won't let me go.

970
01:07:23,209 --> 01:07:27,130
Violet, just walk out. She doesn't
own you. You can still make it here.

971
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,965
I'm... I'm sorry.

972
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:33,053
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

973
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:34,721
Violet.

974
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,019
- What's the story?
- She's not coming.

975
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:43,605
So what am I supposed to do, Kevin?
I got a whole spot to fill.

976
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,274
I'm sorry, Richie.
I made a mistake.

977
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:49,986
Whoa, this doesn't change
anything with us, Kevin.

978
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,447
A deal's a deal.
Am I right?

979
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:02,248
All she wants to do
is dance, dance, dance

980
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:06,753
Wild-eyed pistol wavers
who ain't afraid to die

981
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:09,339
And all she wants to do is

982
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:12,717
All she wants to do
is dance and make romance

983
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:18,223
She can't feel the heat
Comin' off the street

984
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:21,643
- She wants to party
- Ooh

985
01:08:21,726 --> 01:08:24,062
- She wants to get down
- Ooh

986
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:26,106
All she wants to do is

987
01:08:26,147 --> 01:08:28,441
All she wants to do is dance

988
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:31,820
And make romance

989
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,613
I'm the guy! Me!

990
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:37,283
All she wants to do is dance

991
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:41,454
Zach, who said
you could be up here?

992
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,253
You're not supposed
to be up here.

993
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:51,047
All right.
Take it easy, Zach.

994
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:53,133
Zach, take it easy.

995
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:56,970
- We barely made the airport
for the last plane out
- Hey! Hey!

996
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,682
- Hey, hey, knock it off!
- Kevin!

997
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:02,392
- Lil!
- Hey!

998
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:06,730
Break it up!

999
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,816
- Kevin, that's enough!
- 'Cause all she wants to do is dance

1000
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:11,109
Lou!

1001
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,659
Kevin, that's enough!
Kevin, that's enough!

1002
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:21,661
- Get off me!
- Stop it!

1003
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:25,331
- Kevin, Zach's a regular,
and he was just having fun.
- Having fun with my girlfriend!

1004
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:29,461
- Lou, get him out of here!
- You're gonna chill outside,
or I'm calling the cops.

1005
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:32,088
- Out of my way! Move!
- Let me go!

1006
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:38,261
- Get the hell out of here!
- Hey, everybody,
free drinks on the house.

1007
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,388
I'm paying. Get up here.

1008
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,308
Kevin. Kevin.
What is your problem?

1009
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:47,937
Look, I'm sorry about tonight,
but look at this. There was
no way Lil was gonna let me out.

1010
01:09:47,937 --> 01:09:50,190
This is not about Lil.
This is about you and this place.

1011
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,777
- This is my job.
- It's a goddam sandbox
for you to stick your head in.

1012
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:56,488
- What is that supposed to mean?
- The place is a joke.

1013
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:58,156
All right?
They don't come to watch you sing.

1014
01:09:58,156 --> 01:10:01,701
- They come to watch girls
shaking it on a bar!
- And what would you have me do?

1015
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,953
- Sing for quarters in the park?
- Well, at least you'd be
singing your own songs.

1016
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:06,956
I told you I can't do that,
so stop pushing!

1017
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:11,586
I'm just asking you to try, but I guess
that's asking a bit too much.

1018
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:15,131
Right. It's so easy to be you,
isn't it?

1019
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:18,635
You have no dreams, no hopes,
no chance of getting hurt.

1020
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:21,930
When was the last time
you took a chance on something?

1021
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,225
- Some of us don't have that luxury.
- Why is that?

1022
01:10:28,853 --> 01:10:32,565
Oh, right. We don't talk about you,
right? It's a big secret.

1023
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,985
Come on, Kevin.
Let's play a game.

1024
01:10:36,194 --> 01:10:38,613
I'm gonna guess why
you left Australia.

1025
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:41,324
- Doesn't matter.
- You were in jail.

1026
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:45,537
No, that's not it.
You have a wife and four kids in Sydney.

1027
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:48,456
Come on. Am I getting warm? Come on,
Kevin. I don't have a lot of time.

1028
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:50,792
Why'd you run away from home?

1029
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:54,879
I didn't have a home.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1030
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:57,340
I don't have a family.

1031
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:01,177
I mean, that's the big secret.
Are you happy?

1032
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:04,431
Huh? Are you gonna
feel sorry for me now?

1033
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:09,019
You gonna hold me close while I tell you
I had to change homes every two years?

1034
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:11,980
I had a bad childhood.
Big deal.

1035
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,858
I don't need your sympathy,
'cause I'm here...

1036
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,943
and I'm living on my two feet
like I wanted to.

1037
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,820
That was my dream.

1038
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:22,866
And at least I did it
with a little bit of dignity.

1039
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:26,786
And I didn't.
That's it?

1040
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,581
Well, just unbutton the blouse
a little and unzip the pants.

1041
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:33,168
Show a little bit of flesh.
I think you can figure it out.

1042
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,550
Go on in. Your fans are waitin'
for ya to crawl on a bar.

1043
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,906
I told you
not to break the rules.

1044
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:06,451
What are you talking about?

1045
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,329
I'm talking about you and your boyfriend
making a scene in my bar.

1046
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:12,207
I'm talking about a friend of mine
inside with a broken nose.

1047
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:16,002
The rules were simple, Jersey.
I've fired girls for a lot less.

1048
01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:19,172
What, so I can't have a boyfriend now?
What kind of stupid shit is that?

1049
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:21,508
Hey! This place is my home...

1050
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:24,928
and I'm not willing to risk
everything I have on your personal life.

1051
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:27,639
- It's business, plain and simple.
- This is not business.

1052
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:30,684
I worked my ass off for you,
and you're supposed to be my friend.

1053
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:33,061
I never said I was your friend.

1054
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,397
I'm your boss, and you knew
the rules like everybody else.

1055
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:39,150
Will you stop with "the rules"?
It's a bar, for Christ's sake!

1056
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:47,325
Then what are you
so upset about?

1057
01:13:11,224 --> 01:13:12,976
Please remember

1058
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:24,612
How we laughed
How we cried

1059
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:29,117
How this world
was yours and mine

1060
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:33,580
And how no dream
was out of reach

1061
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:37,250
I stood by you
You stood by me

1062
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:41,880
We took each day
and made it shine

1063
01:13:43,673 --> 01:13:46,217
We wrote our names
across the sky

1064
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:50,138
We ran so fast
We ran so free

1065
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:53,808
I had you

1066
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:55,935
You had me

1067
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,278
Please remember

1068
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:17,832
- I'm just a love machine
- Oh, my God. Give me a bite.
I'm starving.

1069
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:21,586
Mmm.

1070
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:25,715
- Mmm, thank you.
- How does it feel to be Mrs Molinaro?

1071
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,763
You know, I think he was
a perfect choice for my first marriage.

1072
01:14:33,848 --> 01:14:35,892
- Mmm.
- Hey, Gloria.

1073
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:38,978
- Oh!
- Thanks for inviting me, uh...

1074
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:42,357
I gotta go to work.
I'm on graveyard tonight.

1075
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:46,194
- Thank you, Mr Sanford.
- Yeah, well, it's not worth a hug, dear.

1076
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:48,488
- It's only 50 bucks.
- Aw.

1077
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:52,659
- Your old man's a ten, Vi.
- Eleven, some days a twelve.

1078
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,664
- Well, it's a beautiful wedding.
- No, you can't go.

1079
01:14:57,664 --> 01:15:01,418
I just want one picture of you
and Violet dancing together. Come on.

1080
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:03,044
Wise men say

1081
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,800
- Okay. Come on. Smile.
- Only fools

1082
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:10,885
Rush in

1083
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:16,391
But I can't help

1084
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,353
Are you really working,
or are you leaving because of me?

1085
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:23,857
- Falling in love
- You know I don't like to wear a tie.

1086
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,442
With you

1087
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,364
- Ha-ha.
- Shall I...

1088
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:35,410
So this is how it's gonna be?
You're not gonna return my phone calls?

1089
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,580
If you needed money,
you should have come to me.

1090
01:15:38,913 --> 01:15:41,291
I would have found a way
to take care of you.

1091
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:44,085
Dad, you can't even
take care of yourself.

1092
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:47,547
Hey, I am doing just fine
on my own, thank you very much.

1093
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:50,258
Oh, really? So how come
you're not wearing any socks?

1094
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:52,010
Falling in love

1095
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:57,265
- With you
- I had a minor disagreement
with the clothes dryer.

1096
01:15:58,224 --> 01:16:00,101
Like a river flows

1097
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:04,647
- Just face it, Dad. You need me.
- Surely to the sea

1098
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:08,735
- And I moved out,
and that's what bothers you.
- Darling, so it goes

1099
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:10,320
Some things

1100
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:13,740
- No. No.
- Are meant to be

1101
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,617
What bothers me...

1102
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:19,871
- Take my hand
- is, for the first time in my life...

1103
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:22,123
I was ashamed of you.

1104
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:24,668
- Take my whole
- I would have never thought that
would ever have been possible.

1105
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:26,127
Life too

1106
01:16:29,547 --> 01:16:31,132
For I can't

1107
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:34,135
Help

1108
01:16:35,428 --> 01:16:37,180
Falling in love

1109
01:16:38,848 --> 01:16:41,685
Hey, it's me.
Leave a message after the beep.

1110
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:45,522
Violet? I've just finished work,
and in a few hours I'm going...

1111
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,817
to unload
three disgusting fish trucks.

1112
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:51,653
I thought maybe you'd like
to come and give me a hand.

1113
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:54,280
- But you're not in, or...
- Okay, okay, okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1114
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,574
you're not picking up, so...

1115
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:58,451
I'll call back...

1116
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,995
because I'm hoping
one day you...

1117
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,290
will wanna talk.

1118
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:06,543
Kevin? Hello?

1119
01:17:21,349 --> 01:17:23,393
Kevin? Hello? It's me.

1120
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:27,814
- I'm here.
- Is this Violet Sanford?

1121
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:32,193
- Yes.
- I'm calling from
Riverview Medical Centre.

1122
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:36,865
We have a patient here by the
name of William James Sanford.
Is that your father?

1123
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:41,661
Dr Lee to Paediatrics, please.
Dr Lee to Paediatrics, please.

1124
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:45,040
Violet Sanford?

1125
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:48,710
- Yeah?
- Your dad's in recovery right now.

1126
01:17:49,502 --> 01:17:52,172
The car struck him on his right side
when he was walking to the booth.

1127
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:55,842
His right leg is broken,
and there was some arterial damage
we had to go in and repair.

1128
01:17:55,842 --> 01:17:58,428
But other than that,
it's just a lot of bumps and bruises.

1129
01:17:58,428 --> 01:18:00,889
I'd say he's a pretty lucky guy.

1130
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,308
Violet?

1131
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:07,771
I told you, don't come down here.
It's your wedding night.

1132
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:11,733
Oh, are you kidding? Danny's been
in my family for five minutes.

1133
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:16,738
You've been in my family
my whole life.

1134
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:51,898
I'm sorry.

1135
01:18:54,734 --> 01:18:56,653
I love you so much.

1136
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:04,703
I never did thank you
for the dance.

1137
01:19:06,871 --> 01:19:08,498
That's okay.

1138
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:10,709
That's all right.

1139
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:37,986
My tapes.

1140
01:19:49,664 --> 01:19:53,335
Come on. Just call him.
Just pick up the phone and call him.

1141
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,761
Don't call him.

1142
01:20:05,096 --> 01:20:07,640
Told you.
This place is a palace.

1143
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:10,643
It's pretty late.
Are you sure you wanna do this now?

1144
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:14,064
Well, here's my door.
No turning back now. Come on in.

1145
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:18,693
Oh, you're so right.
This place is a palace.

1146
01:20:18,902 --> 01:20:22,572
- Would I lie to you?
- This is a great idea. I'm so glad...

1147
01:20:25,116 --> 01:20:27,410
- Nice strong pulse.
- Mmm.

1148
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:30,747
Don't look at me like that.
I'm a sick man.

1149
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:33,583
You can eat whatever you want now,
but when we go back home...

1150
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,086
it's egg whites
and Lean Cuisines.

1151
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:39,172
- I'lI see you later, Bill.
- W-Wait a minute.

1152
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:42,217
What do you mean,
"until we go home"?

1153
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:46,304
I'm moving back.

1154
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:51,351
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't sing my songs.

1155
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:54,312
I was afraid.

1156
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:01,319
Do you know why Mommy quit?

1157
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,533
Yeah, she told me.
'Cause she couldn't do it.

1158
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:08,493
No, that's not it.

1159
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:13,039
She wasn't afraid, Vi.

1160
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,836
Your mother on stage...
Oh, she was amazing.

1161
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:22,549
Then why did she quit?

1162
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:26,177
Because of me.

1163
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:30,890
Right after you were born,
she told me she wanted to quit...

1164
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:33,268
and I let her.

1165
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,775
See, I knew how good she was,
but I never told her.

1166
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:45,905
I loved her...

1167
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,659
more than anything.

1168
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:53,872
And I just went on and pretended
that there was no other choice.

1169
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:58,335
- Dad, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1170
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:02,380
I'm not gonna make the same
mistake twice. You're not
goin' back to work for Pete.

1171
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:06,718
I don't care what it takes. I don't care
how many bars you have to stand on.

1172
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:10,680
You are not comin' home.
I'm not letting you back in the house.

1173
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:12,599
Forget it.

1174
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:25,612
- Are you wearing cologne?
- Hmm? No!

1175
01:22:26,404 --> 01:22:29,324
Oh, well, it's just
a splash of Old Spice.

1176
01:22:31,576 --> 01:22:33,661
Where did you get Old Spice?

1177
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:36,915
That nice redheaded nurse
gave it to me as a gift.

1178
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:40,293
Then she asked me out
for coffee.

1179
01:22:40,293 --> 01:22:41,878
I'm scared.

1180
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,506
Are you gonna go on a date?

1181
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:46,132
God, a date.

1182
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:50,178
I better buy a pair of socks.

1183
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,902
Okay. Come on in here.
Watch out for the... Okay. Okay.

1184
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:15,745
Try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss

1185
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,544
Can't fight the moonlight

1186
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,429
Can't fight the moonlight

1187
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:36,683
You'll surrender your heart

1188
01:23:37,475 --> 01:23:40,061
But you know
But you know that you

1189
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:49,529
Okay if I eat here at the bar?

1190
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:53,700
- Do you have a reservation?
- Uh, yeah.

1191
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:58,538
It's under, um,
"cast-iron heartless bitch."

1192
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:02,292
Could it be under
"stubborn and pigheaded"?

1193
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:04,252
Yes. That's the one.

1194
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:09,424
I'lI have a double water
on the rocks, please.

1195
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:12,844
- How'd you find me?
- Cammie.

1196
01:24:13,386 --> 01:24:16,931
She told me about your pop.
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1197
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:18,641
He's okay.

1198
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,435
Good.

1199
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,898
- So am I.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

1200
01:24:26,816 --> 01:24:28,943
What's good to eat here?

1201
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:32,906
Lil, you didn't come here to eat.
What do you want?

1202
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:38,703
'Kay.

1203
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:45,919
I just wanted to let you know you can
come back to the bar whenever you want.

1204
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:51,341
- I appreciate the offer,
but I'm okay here.
- I figured that.

1205
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:54,803
You were never a lifer.

1206
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:58,348
I'm married to that bar.
Hell, I'd, uh...

1207
01:24:58,598 --> 01:25:02,185
I'd sleep there if I had the guts
to walk around barefoot.

1208
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,232
But that's me, you know?
I'm the original Coyote.

1209
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:12,195
Just a small-town gal trying
to make it in the big bad city.

1210
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:15,490
"Small-town gal"?

1211
01:25:18,284 --> 01:25:20,370
Piedmont, North Dakota.

1212
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:25,458
You ever tell anyone that,
I'll kill ya.

1213
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:29,796
Take care, Jersey.

1214
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:34,718
You have one new message.

1215
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:39,514
I have one message in eight hours.
How pathetic am I?

1216
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:42,225
Violet, this is Lindsay Morgan
from the Bowery Ballroom.

1217
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:44,477
Listen, we loved your CD...

1218
01:25:44,936 --> 01:25:48,273
and we want you to play in our
songwriter's showcase next Sunday night.

1219
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:51,860
You're on at 10:00 sharp.
So drop your music by the club...

1220
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,404
and the house band
can learn your song.

1221
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:58,908
Now if you have any questions,
don't be afraid to give me a shout.
See ya Sunday.

1222
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:01,870
- Here are the keys to the apartment.
It's all yours.
- Thank you.

1223
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:05,373
I can't thank you enough
for subleasing me this place.
You don't know how long I looked.

1224
01:26:05,373 --> 01:26:07,208
And when is your boyfriend
moving in?

1225
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:10,253
He's actually coming in
tomorrow from Boston.

1226
01:26:10,795 --> 01:26:15,216
It's historic, guys.
This is the first night
I've closed early in three years.

1227
01:26:15,216 --> 01:26:17,969
Ta-da. Will you hang that
outside for me?

1228
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:19,971
- Hey, Lou, you got that number
I asked you about?
- Yep.

1229
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:22,515
So why are you moving
to Chicago?

1230
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:25,268
I'll figure that out
when I get there.

1231
01:26:25,518 --> 01:26:26,936
Um, oh.

1232
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:33,651
- Hello.
- Hey, do yourseIf a favour
and look at page 137 of The Voice.

1233
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:37,864
I can't believe your name is in
the paper. I'm gettin' this framed.

1234
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:41,326
Dad, if you're not ready in five
minutes, I'm gonna leave without you.

1235
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:44,788
Keep your pants on, will ya?
I'm physically challenged.

1236
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:49,668
I only got three rolls of film.
I hope that's enough.

1237
01:26:49,668 --> 01:26:52,003
Dad, I'm only singing
one song.

1238
01:26:52,003 --> 01:26:54,547
Right. Better go get
another one.

1239
01:26:56,883 --> 01:27:00,553
- Hey, Bill.
- My kid's singing tonight
at some club in the city.

1240
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:04,933
She's a little nervous.
Hey, maybe you can give us
a one, two, three for luck.

1241
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:07,727
You got it. All right, let's give it up
for Bill Sanford's daughter.

1242
01:27:07,727 --> 01:27:10,105
Light 'em up. One, two, three.

1243
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:16,319
Oh, look, Vi.

1244
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:20,073
I can't do this.

1245
01:27:20,865 --> 01:27:22,242
Jesus!

1246
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:27,580
Did I mention to you
that I was recently
in a horrific car accident?

1247
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:29,791
I... I can't do this.
I gotta go back.

1248
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,460
- Violet, listen to me.
Are you listening?
- Yes.

1249
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:35,547
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You're already a star.

1250
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:38,967
- Dad, what are you talking about?
I'm a nobody.
- If you're such a nobody...

1251
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:42,053
then why did I buy this off Pete
for 20 bucks?

1252
01:27:44,055 --> 01:27:48,810
- Why do you have that?
- I saw it on the wall, decided
I wanted the first autograph.

1253
01:27:48,893 --> 01:27:52,188
I figured it'd be
a damn good investment.
Now what are you waiting for?

1254
01:27:52,188 --> 01:27:54,107
I didn't spend three months
in physical therapy...

1255
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:57,318
just to take a ride
to the state line, you got me?

1256
01:27:57,318 --> 01:28:01,322
- Yeah, I got ya.
- So what do you say, Vi?
How about another U-ey?

1257
01:28:06,327 --> 01:28:09,497
You guys call that a one, two, three?
Now, let's do it again!

1258
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:11,708
This time I wanna feel chills!

1259
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,293
There goes Bill again.
He's back for seconds.

1260
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:16,129
Come on, now!
Let's give him all we got!

1261
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,049
Whoo! Let's go!

1262
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:22,260
The only reason
why I came down here tonight
is to see her fall on her face.

1263
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,929
Oh, take it easy, Rachel.
It's supposed to be a fun night out.

1264
01:28:24,929 --> 01:28:27,098
- Excuse me.
- I'm cool. Don't worry about me.

1265
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:30,352
- Hi. Good evening, ladies.
Can I help you?
- No.

1266
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:33,104
It's packed, Lindsay. The house band
has been on for 1 5 minutes.

1267
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:35,940
If she's not here in five,
she's bumped.

1268
01:28:36,232 --> 01:28:38,234
- Look out!
- Jesus!

1269
01:28:38,401 --> 01:28:41,279
Uh, now that we're here,
I'm feeling a little nervous.

1270
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:43,323
Thank you, Mr Sanford.

1271
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,118
Oh, oh, probably just carsick.

1272
01:28:47,118 --> 01:28:50,413
Forget I mentioned it.
I'm fine. Have a great show.

1273
01:28:52,832 --> 01:28:54,084
Vi.

1274
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:58,421
Get your butt in there.
Come on. We're right behind you.

1275
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:00,840
Break a leg, sweetie.

1276
01:29:03,259 --> 01:29:07,639
Ladies and gentlemen,
making her Bowery Ballroom debut,
Miss Violet Sanford!

1277
01:29:33,915 --> 01:29:35,458
I'm sorry.

1278
01:29:39,546 --> 01:29:41,756
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Come on.

1279
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:53,935
Under a lovers' sky

1280
01:29:54,477 --> 01:29:56,312
Gonna be with you

1281
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:59,858
And no one's gonna be around

1282
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:04,195
If you think
that you won't fall

1283
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:06,698
We'll just wait until

1284
01:30:07,032 --> 01:30:09,075
Till the sun goes down

1285
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:13,038
Underneath the starlight, starlight

1286
01:30:15,665 --> 01:30:18,209
There's a magical feelin' so right

1287
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:22,839
It will take you in tonight

1288
01:30:24,132 --> 01:30:26,926
- You can try to resist
- Whoo! Violet!

1289
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:30,472
Try to hide from my kiss
but you know

1290
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:33,600
But you know that you
can't fight the moonlight

1291
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:37,645
Deep in the dark
you'll surrender your heart

1292
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:40,899
But you know, but you know

1293
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,818
That you can't fight
the moonlight, no

1294
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:47,906
You can't fight it

1295
01:30:49,366 --> 01:30:51,659
It's gonna get to your heart

1296
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,413
There's no escape from love

1297
01:30:55,997 --> 01:30:58,041
Once the gentle breeze

1298
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:01,670
Weaves its spell
upon your heart

1299
01:31:03,171 --> 01:31:05,298
No matter what you think

1300
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:09,302
It won't be too long
till you're in my arms

1301
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:13,682
- Come on, baby. Shake it!
- Underneath
- Hey, pinhead!

1302
01:31:13,682 --> 01:31:15,684
- The starlight, starlight
- That's what I'm talking about, baby!
Now shake it!

1303
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:19,187
Don't do it, Rach. He's a big guy,
and you're still on probation.

1304
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:22,190
Don't worry. Those classes
are really paying off.

1305
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:24,567
It'll steal your heart tonight

1306
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,529
You can try to resist

1307
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:29,989
Try to hide from my kiss

1308
01:31:30,365 --> 01:31:32,575
But you know, but you know

1309
01:31:32,617 --> 01:31:35,161
That you can't fight the moonlight

1310
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:39,040
Deep in the dark
you'll surrender your heart

1311
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,210
But you know, but you know

1312
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,754
That you can't fight the moonlight

1313
01:31:59,352 --> 01:32:02,731
Okay. Let's give a big Coyote welcome
to LeAnn Rimes.

1314
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:06,234
You can try to resist

1315
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:09,029
Try to hide from my kiss

1316
01:32:09,654 --> 01:32:12,657
But you know, but you know
that you can't...

1317
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:18,038
So tell me, what do you do
when you realize that all
your dreams have come true?

1318
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:19,748
Pay off old debts.

1319
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:22,375
But you know,
but you know that you

1320
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:25,086
- Can't fight the moonlight
- Volume 129.

1321
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:28,840
The original appearance
of the Punisher... the one I cost you.

1322
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:33,219
- Thank you.
- It'll steal your heart tonight

1323
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:36,264
- You can try
- You can try to resist

1324
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:38,391
Try to hide from my kiss

1325
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:41,644
But you know, but you know

1326
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:44,939
Lil, don't think
your new girl's gonna hack it.

1327
01:32:44,939 --> 01:32:47,942
Deep in the dark
you'll surrender your heart

1328
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,112
- But you know, but you know
- Jersey! Jersey! Jersey!

1329
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:55,200
- That you can't fight the moonlight
- Jersey! Jersey! Jersey! Jersey!

1330
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,161
Jersey! Jersey!
Jersey! Jersey!

1331
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:02,123
You can try to resist my kiss

1332
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:06,419
- But you know, but you know
- Don't you know

1333
01:33:06,628 --> 01:33:09,005
That you can't fight the moonlight

1334
01:33:09,005 --> 01:33:11,216
Oh, no
You can't fight it

1335
01:33:13,677 --> 01:33:15,970
It's gonna get to your heart

1336
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:25,689
Okay. In true Coyote tradition,
I'm gonna make every woman's night...

1337
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:29,484
and auction off the most
handsome little hottie in the place.

1338
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:31,945
Violet, come on.
You can't do this to me again.

1339
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,822
Here he is, girls.

1340
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:39,077
- Come on, Dad!
- All you got is this moment

1341
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:42,080
Okay, ladies.
The bidding will start at $25.

1342
01:33:42,872 --> 01:33:47,544
- 21st century's yesterday
- See, nobody wants to do this.
What are getting me into, Violet?

1343
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:49,504
Twenty-five dollars!

1344
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:53,508
You said you wanted a more active
social life. Come on, girls.

1345
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:55,802
There's a lot of miles
left on these tyres.

1346
01:33:55,802 --> 01:33:59,055
- Fifty dollars!
- Come on, Dad. Strut your stuff.

1347
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:01,558
- And give me a moment
- Seventy-five!

1348
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:03,560
Your moves are so raw

1349
01:34:03,852 --> 01:34:05,937
I've got to let you know

1350
01:34:05,937 --> 01:34:09,190
- I've got to let you know
- Whoo!
- Honey, yeah!

1351
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:14,279

- Now, go! Come to me!
- Take... Take some of it off!

1352
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:19,367
- 'Cause I'm not sleepin'
- Okay, put... put some of it on.

1353
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:23,913
- There's something about you, girl
- Yeah, baby!

1354
01:34:25,248 --> 01:34:28,376
- That makes me sweat
- Ninety!
- Ninety-five!

1355
01:34:30,045 --> 01:34:31,796
How do you feel

1356
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:35,467
- I'm lonely
- Take it off!
- All right, Jersey!

1357
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:37,635

1358
01:34:37,635 --> 01:34:40,930

01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:43,350
So slide over here

- And give me a moment
- $150!

1361
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:49,814
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know

1362
01:34:49,814 --> 01:34:52,442
- Whoo!
- I've got to let you know
- Hey, I'm a Coyote!

1363
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:55,362
- So slide over here
- Well, your father has no problem
with stage fright.

1364
01:34:55,362 --> 01:34:58,281
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw

1365
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:01,910
- I've got to let you know
- So tell me...

1366
01:35:01,993 --> 01:35:06,915
- what do you do when you realize
all your dreams have come true?
- You're one of my kind

1367
01:35:13,505 --> 01:35:14,798
Time

1368
01:35:15,965 --> 01:35:18,551
Sometimes the time
just slips away

1369
01:35:20,887 --> 01:35:23,306
And you're left
with yesterday

1370
01:35:24,474 --> 01:35:26,518
Left with the memories

1371
01:35:29,187 --> 01:35:30,355
l

1372
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:34,192
I'll always think of you
and smile

1373
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,697
And be happy for the time

1374
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:41,908
I had you with me

1375
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:48,164
Though we go
our separate ways

1376
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:54,587
I won't forget
so don't forget

1377
01:35:56,339 --> 01:35:58,425
The memories we've made

1378
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:01,386
Please remember

1379
01:36:03,513 --> 01:36:05,265
Please remember

1380
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:09,310
I was there for you

1381
01:36:10,061 --> 01:36:12,230
And you were there for me

1382
01:36:15,066 --> 01:36:16,693
And remember

1383
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:20,739
Please remember

1384
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:24,951
Me

1385
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,792
Please remember

1386
01:36:34,753 --> 01:36:36,504
Please remember

1387
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:40,508
I was there for you

1388
01:36:41,259 --> 01:36:43,428
And you were there for me

1389
01:36:46,389 --> 01:36:48,016
And remember

1390
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,187
Please remember me

1391
01:36:55,857 --> 01:36:57,609
And how we laughed

1392
01:36:57,609 --> 01:36:59,444
And how we smiled

1393
01:36:59,819 --> 01:37:02,530
And how this world
was yours and mine

1394
01:37:03,698 --> 01:37:06,242
And how no dream
was out of reach

1395
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:09,788
I stood by you
You stood by me

1396
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:14,042
We took each day
and made it shine

1397
01:37:15,418 --> 01:37:17,962
We wrote our names
across the sky

1398
01:37:19,214 --> 01:37:21,591
We ran so fast
We ran so free

1399
01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:25,512
I had you and you had me

1400
01:37:35,355 --> 01:37:37,065
Knew all about

1401
01:37:37,565 --> 01:37:39,484
Your bad reputation

1402
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:43,405
And now it's bound to be
a heartbreak situation

1403
01:37:45,156 --> 01:37:48,243
But I can't help it
if I'm helpless every time

1404
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,204
That I'm where you are

1405
01:37:54,165 --> 01:37:57,252
You walk in and my strength
walks out the door

1406
01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:02,048
Say my name
and I can't fight it any more

1407
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:06,428
Oh, I know I should go

1408
01:38:07,512 --> 01:38:10,348
But I need your touch
just too damn much

1409
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:12,142
Yeah, yeah

1410
01:38:12,517 --> 01:38:14,310
Lovin' you, yeah

1411
01:38:15,645 --> 01:38:19,482
- Isn't really something I should do
- Not something I should do

1412
01:38:20,859 --> 01:38:24,029
I shouldn't want to spend
my time with you, yeah

1413
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:28,199
Well, I should try
to be strong

1414
01:38:28,533 --> 01:38:32,704
- I should try to be strong
- But, baby, you're the right
kind of wrong

1415
01:38:33,496 --> 01:38:35,415
Right kind of wrong

1416
01:38:35,498 --> 01:38:37,876
Baby, you're the right kind
of wrong

1417
01:38:37,876 --> 01:38:40,545
Baby, you're the right kind
of wrong

1418
01:38:42,672 --> 01:38:45,550
Now, baby, you're the right
kind of wrong

1419
01:38:47,677 --> 01:38:49,429
I don't like to

1420
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:52,557
Be alone at night

1421
01:38:53,516 --> 01:38:55,435
And I don't like to

1422
01:38:56,561 --> 01:38:58,938
Hear I'm wrong
when I'm right

1423
01:38:59,606 --> 01:39:02,650
And I don't like to
have the rain on my shoes

1424
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:06,237
But I do love you

1425
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:13,244
I don't like to

1426
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:16,623
See the sky painted grey

1427
01:39:17,582 --> 01:39:20,627
And I don't like to
be the one with the blues

1428
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,255
But I do love you

1429
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:31,388
Love everything about

1430
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:33,723
The way you're loving me

1431
01:39:34,599 --> 01:39:37,519
The way you lay your head
upon my shoulder

1432
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,230
When you sleep

1433
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:43,358
And I love to kiss you
in the rain

1434
01:39:44,651 --> 01:39:46,778
I love everything you do

1435
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,740
Oh, I do

1436
01:39:53,326 --> 01:39:55,245
And I don't like to

1437
01:39:56,579 --> 01:39:58,581
Be alone in the night

1438
01:39:59,457 --> 01:40:01,376
And I don't like to

1439
01:40:02,627 --> 01:40:05,005
Hear I'm wrong
when I'm right

1440
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:07,340
And I don't like to

1441
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:10,635
Have the rain on my shoes

1442
01:40:10,635 --> 01:40:12,470
But I do love you

1443
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:18,226
But I do love you
