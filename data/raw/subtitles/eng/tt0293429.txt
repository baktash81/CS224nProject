Fighting requires both attacking and
defending, not just throwing punches.

[dramatic music playing]

129
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:16,764
[Tsung] The prophecy
is upon us,

130
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:19,335
which means we could lose
the tenth tournament.

131
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:23,371
[deep voice] There is
no prophecy.

132
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,745
Hanzo is a ghost.
I killed him centuries ago.

133
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:32,715
Winning Mortal Kombat
cannot be left to chance.

134
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,417
There will be no tournament

135
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,254
because there'll be
no opposition left to fight.

136
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:42,625
We will already
be victorious.

137
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:48,663
Go now and kill Earth Realm's
champions, Bi-Han.

138
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:53,668
I am no longer Bi-Han.
I am Sub-Zero.

You're a hell of a fighter, man.

144
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:38,780
- Thank you.
- Respect.

145
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,182
All right.

146
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:43,885
- Ready to go?
- In a sec.

147
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,422
What do you got there?

148
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:47,789
It's a string bracelet.

150
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,667
You just made this?

00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,303
Yeah.

152
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:02,471
That's pretty cool.

153
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:03,505
Want me to put it on?

154
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,375
[groans] My hand.

155
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,213
Now, we got one each.

156
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,249
You're sure you're okay?

157
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:15,851
Yeah.

158
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,353
Guess I should have thrown
the uppercut, huh?

159
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,021
Cole Young.

160
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,391
The man that took the belt
from Eddie Tobias.

161
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:24,326
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

162
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,394
Have me met?

163
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:26,694
No.

164
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,863
Name's Jax.

165
00:18:27,895 --> 00:18:29,330
[Cole] Nice to meet you, Jax.

166
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:30,833
You could've won today,

167
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:32,600
had you controlled the cage.

168
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:33,902
Told you so.

169
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,938
[laughs] She's smart.

170
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,008
All right, well,
time to go eat, yeah.

171
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:44,947
One more thing, champ.

172
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:49,451
That dragon logo you got...
I, I dig that, man.

173
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:51,452
It's unique.

174
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:52,488
Where'd you get it from?

175
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,821
He was born with it.

176
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,758
- What do you mean?
- It's a birthmark.

177
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,025
You serious?

178
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,394
Pretty cool. Show him.

179
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,604
Well, ain't that something.

180
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:09,672
Nice chatting with you.

181
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,307
See you around, champ.

182
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:16,846
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

183
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,548
Still in one piece.

184
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:21,616
How'd it go?

185
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,686
He was this close
to beating him.

186
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,054
- This close.
- Yes.

187
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:29,525
You sure you're okay?

188
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,294
Standing.

189
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:33,863
- Let's go order.
- Yeah.

190
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,108
[Jax] Got my eyes
on him right now.

191
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,611
He's got the mark, I saw it.

192
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:51,514
He's with his family.

193
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:15,871
Ally.

194
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,105
Come take a look at this.

195
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,106
It's snowing.

196
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:24,980
[Allison] But it's July.

197
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:28,584
[crackling]

198
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,859
[dramatic music playing]

199
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:58,847
- Emily!
- [Allison] Emily!

200
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,918
[car honking]

201
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,787
[tires screeching]

202
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,554
Get in the truck, Cole!

203
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,056
Now!

204
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:10,759
- [Allison] Come on, come on.
- Move, move, move, move.

205
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,826
[ice crashing]

206
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,669
[tires screeching]

207
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,581
Blade, I got him.

208
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,886
I'll see you at base at 2300.

209
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,456
What the fuck is that thing?

210
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,092
Funny. It didn't sound much
like thanks for saving my ass.

211
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,094
Whatever that was back there,

212
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:47,829
it's after both of us. Look.

213
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,798
That's, that's impossible.

214
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:54,135
It's not a birthmark, Cole.

215
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,071
[tires screeching]

216
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:59,208
- It means you've been chosen.
- Chosen, for what?

217
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,710
- To fight.
- You got the wrong person, all right?

218
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:03,244
I'm not the fighter
that I used to be, okay.

219
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,814
No, shit.
But they don't have the marking.

220
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,816
So, like it or not Cole,
you're the guy.

221
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,884
As long as you got that marking
they're coming for you,

222
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,652
and they will kill
whoever they have to,

223
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:12,587
to get to you.

224
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:19,861
[crackling]

225
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:30,739
Take the truck.

226
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:31,973
Get your family to safety.

227
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:34,910
[Allison] Cole?

228
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,279
[Jax] You need to get
to Gary, Indiana.

229
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,817
Find Sonya Blade,
806 West Washington Boulevard.

230
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:44,019
Are you sure?
We can take him out together.

231
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:47,021
[Jax] You want your family on
a fucking slab in the morgue?

232
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,257
Now get out of here.

233
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,191
[gun cocking]

234
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:53,996
Hold on tight, guys.

235
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:54,997
[engine revving]

236
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:03,638
So you wanna play
hide and seek.

237
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:28,596
[icicles crackling]

238
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:31,066
[exhales]

239
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:34,636
[breathing heavily]

240
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:38,106
[icicles crackling]

241
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:43,545
[Jax groans]

242
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:45,814
[grunts]

243
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:51,220
[Jax grunts]

244
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:52,788
[groans]

245
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,592
[Jax grunting]

246
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,105
Done six tours, motherfucker.

247
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:16,778
[Jax grunts]

248
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,980
[groans]

249
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:31,360
[groans]

250
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:33,596
[grunting]

251
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,732
[groans]

252
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,101
[screams]

253
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:44,907
[groans]

254
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:49,177
[screams]

255
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:52,747
[panting]

256
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:00,956
[breathing heavily]

257
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:10,298
[thuds]

258
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:45,733
She's finally asleep.

259
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:50,706
[sighs]

260
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:52,374
I should go.

261
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,844
You'll be safe here, Ally.

262
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,179
You heard what Jax said.

263
00:25:58,212 --> 00:26:01,048
That thing is hunting
people with the marking.

264
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,018
It's after me.

265
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,186
And if I stay here
and it shows up,

266
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,422
it could kill us all.

267
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,790
I'm not gonna let that happen.

268
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:12,394
Jax could have killed it. I...

269
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:15,431
We have to be sure.

270
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:17,966
<i>The name he gave me,</i>

271
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,401
<i>Sonya Blade,</i>

272
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,769
<i>hopefully,
she'll have some answers.</i>

273
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,134
[Mileena] Master.

274
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:56,070
Sub-Zero tracked and killed

275
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:58,140
another one
of Earth's champions.

276
00:26:58,173 --> 00:26:59,875
But another has escaped.

277
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:02,409
Have our assassins
double the efforts.

278
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:03,912
What of Lord Raiden?

279
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:05,480
If he discovers
we're breaking rules

280
00:27:05,512 --> 00:27:07,048
set in stone
by the Elder Gods...

281
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,083
Leave the Elder Gods to me.

282
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:11,219
We didn't win
nine straight tournaments

283
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,020
by following the rules.

284
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:16,024
Mileena, let's finish this.

285
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:18,059
Send in the reptilian, Syzoth.

286
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:50,792
[effort grunt]

287
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:07,476
[dog barks distantly]

288
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:10,945
[Cole groans]

289
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,447
[both grunting]

290
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,414
[Cole groans]

291
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:18,019
- What you doing here?
- Wait.

292
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:19,453
I'm looking for Sonya Blade.

293
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,156
Jax sent me.

294
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:23,024
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

295
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:23,925
The marking.

296
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:29,530
[breathing heavily]

297
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm Sonya.

298
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,303
[Blade] Jax hasn't checked in.
Where is he?

299
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:38,105
[Cole] He stayed behind
to fight.

300
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:42,411
Close the door.

301
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,918
Jax, where are you?

302
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:54,623
[whispers] Come on.

303
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:56,457
[Cole] You guys in military?

304
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,425
Special forces.

305
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,428
[door creaking]

306
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,000
[Cole] Holy... What is this?

307
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:07,468
[Blade] We needed a safe place
to run our operation.

308
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,537
[Cole] Well, this looks,
uh, pretty safe.

309
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:11,272
Looks like you're ready
for anything.

310
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:12,641
[Blade] This is where we keep

311
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,242
all we've learned
about the dragon markings.

312
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:18,046
First learned about this
seven years ago.

313
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:19,681
Jax and I were on a mission
in Brazil

314
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:21,615
to capture a wanted fugitive.

315
00:29:21,648 --> 00:29:23,083
When we got there,

316
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:25,986
the target
had superhuman abilities.

317
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,023
Tore through our unit
in seconds.

318
00:29:29,057 --> 00:29:32,192
The target had the same
marking you do, Cole.

319
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:34,262
When Jax finally took it down

320
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:38,133
the dragon marking transferred
directly onto his skin.

321
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:41,336
I spent years trying to
figure out what it all means.

322
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:42,971
It seems
that throughout history,

323
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:44,538
different cultures
all over the world,

324
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:47,174
they reference
a great tournament.

325
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:50,644
My research shows
that there's realms and species

326
00:29:50,678 --> 00:29:52,480
that we didn't
even know existed.

327
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,182
That dragon marking,

328
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:55,449
it signifies
that you've been chosen

329
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:56,984
to fight for Earth.

330
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:58,353
It's an invitation...

331
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,922
to fight for something known

332
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:02,391
as Mortal Kombat.

333
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:07,329
Did you make that last part up?

334
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:08,630
[chuckles] It just kind
of sounds like you made it up.

335
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:10,298
I mean, and look,
they spelled it wrong.

336
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,699
Hey, you listen to me.

337
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,667
I think there's another
tournament coming.

338
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:15,303
That's why you're here.

339
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:17,238
That is why Jax
and I have been tracking you

340
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,973
because we need to find
every last champion

341
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,275
before it's too late.

342
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:22,376
And FYI, most of them
are dead already.

343
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,715
There's more to this, Cole.

344
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:30,117
I know it.

345
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:33,621
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

346
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:36,090
- [Kano] I hate to interrupt your bullshit, blondie.
- [gasps]

347
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:38,159
But I gotta piss again.

348
00:30:38,192 --> 00:30:39,995
What is this?
You have a visitor.

349
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:41,028
[Blade] Careful, he bites.

350
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:47,469
Oh, hello, sunshine.

351
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:49,537
Who are you?

352
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:51,405
- He's Kano.
- Kano?

353
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:53,540
Kano, what?

354
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:55,509
Kano, none of your
fucking business.

355
00:30:56,676 --> 00:30:58,278
Was that Russian?

356
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:00,481
Do I sound Russian to you,
you fucking idiot?

357
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:02,684
He's a mercenary
with The Black Dragon clan.

358
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:04,753
Arms dealer, drug runner,

359
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:06,287
murder for hire,

360
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,621
scum of the Earth.

361
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:09,656
I also give
really good foot massages.

362
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,157
You have a marking.

363
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,694
Actually, that's kind of
a funny story.

364
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:14,429
You want to tell him?

365
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,096
I was tracking
another champion.

366
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,800
I was lucky enough
to find Kano here instead.

367
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,634
Right after he slit
the guy's throat.

368
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,703
You know, next time
be more punctual.

369
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,240
You were never chosen.

370
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:27,741
Fate has better standards
than you.

371
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:30,311
Lucky for you
I don't have any standards.

372
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,447
We'll see if you're a natural blonde.
[laughs]

373
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:34,583
[Kano groans]

374
00:31:35,383 --> 00:31:36,351
[coughs]

375
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:38,052
Not bad.

376
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:40,521
Almost felt that one.

377
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:41,722
[groans]

378
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:43,291
[Cole] What about you?

379
00:31:43,324 --> 00:31:44,192
- Where's your marking?
- I don't have one.

380
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,063
[crashing]

381
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:52,233
[Kano] Come on.

382
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:54,069
Hey, hey, new guy, new guy.

383
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:55,303
Get me out of here.
I could help you.

384
00:31:55,336 --> 00:31:57,172
Just sit tight.

385
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,673
I was about to go for a stroll,

386
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:00,307
but maybe I'll stick around,
you fucking idiots.

387
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:03,444
[lights flickering]

388
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,182
[metal clanking]

389
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:13,520
[objects clattering]

390
00:32:13,554 --> 00:32:14,556
[creature squeals]

391
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:19,124
[Kano groans]

392
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:24,466
- [creature squeals]
- [groans]

393
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:29,704
[growls]

394
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:34,509
What the fuck was that?

395
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:37,212
That was my knife, too!

396
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:39,280
Fucking poetry.

397
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:40,382
Where is it?

398
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:42,517
- Where?
- Shh.

399
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,493
[grunts]

400
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:03,138
Did you shoot it?

401
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:04,239
I thought I clipped it.

402
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,374
[Blade groans]

403
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:10,377
[grunts]

404
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:12,513
[groans]

405
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,887
Sonya, are you okay?

406
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:24,759
All right. I'm out of here.

407
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:25,693
[groans]

408
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:30,365
[Cole] Kano, use the flare!

409
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:37,871
[creature squeals]

410
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:38,906
[Kano] There you are.

411
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,775
[grunts]

412
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:54,756
[growls]

413
00:33:58,726 --> 00:33:59,628
[all grunting]

414
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:01,363
[growls]

415
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,467
[grunting]

416
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:10,938
Knife.

417
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,716
[both scream]

418
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:31,525
Kano wins.

419
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,427
[laughs]

420
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:36,498
You fucking beauty.

421
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:39,733
[fire blazing]

422
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:48,843
[Blade] Fucking A,

423
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,412
years of research
just destroyed.

424
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:52,847
So do you believe me now?

425
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,515
[Cole] Yeah. What's the plan?

426
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:55,549
[Blade sighs] There is none.

427
00:34:58,052 --> 00:34:59,586
Oh, gee.

428
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:00,922
Make yourself at home.

429
00:35:00,954 --> 00:35:02,289
Yeah, I have.

430
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:03,590
Oh, by the way,
you beer's shit,

431
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:04,625
and you're almost out of it.

432
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,362
[sniffles]

433
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:11,965
What are you doing?

434
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,601
Just working on
a Kano graphic novel.

435
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,371
I fancy myself
a bit of an artist.

436
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:19,574
He's a psychopath.

437
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:21,543
All the best artists
are a little twisted, mate.

438
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,748
[sighs]

439
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:28,682
Well,

440
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:30,984
I'm off.

441
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,420
You're trying to get
to Raiden's temple, aren't you?

442
00:35:32,452 --> 00:35:33,387
That should be fun.

443
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:35,623
You know where that is?

444
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:36,891
What's Raiden's temple?

445
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:38,425
Yeah, used to run
guns through there.

446
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:40,594
The locals
wouldn't shut the fuck up...

447
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,764
[Blade] Legends says champions used
to train there for Mortal Kombat.

448
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:44,331
Ah, for fuck sake.

449
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:45,732
No one knows where it is.

450
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:46,934
Well, they do now.

451
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,603
- Excuse me.
- Where is it?

452
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:50,404
Uh, you got a pen?
You want to write this down?

453
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:51,472
Get fucked.

454
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:52,673
'Cause I'm not gonna help you.

455
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:54,342
You kidnapped me.
You tied me up.

456
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,809
You threw a knife
through my fucking leg,

457
00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:57,511
on purpose.

458
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:59,747
And then that lizard thing
took off half my face.

459
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,850
Lucky for me,
you can hardly notice it.

460
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:04,751
So yeah,
it's a hard pass for me

461
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:05,886
on the helping you thing.

462
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:08,590
And get out of me fucking way.

463
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:11,960
Okay.

464
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:13,894
[Kano] There you go.

465
00:36:18,898 --> 00:36:20,335
Everyone's got a price.

466
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,735
- Name yours.
- You can't afford me.

467
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:22,703
Two million.

468
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:23,605
[laughs]

469
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:25,672
That's good.

470
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:26,941
You living in this shit hole

471
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:28,476
and you got
two million dollars.

472
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:29,644
Pig's ass.

473
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,012
I have lived here
my whole life.

474
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:33,347
You piece of shit.
You watch your mouth.

475
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,481
Two million dollars.

476
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,353
Yeah. No, fuck you.

477
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:41,690
Fuck it. Three million.

478
00:36:43,056 --> 00:36:44,725
That's my final offer.

479
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,827
And anything,
I find inside that temple

480
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,029
I keep, no fucking splitsies.

481
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:50,865
Plus,
if you're bullshitting me,

482
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:52,367
I'll fucking kill you.

483
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,434
No skin off my sack.

484
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,704
Great.

485
00:36:56,737 --> 00:36:58,905
- Sounds like we got a deal.
- [clicks tongue]

486
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,440
I was gonna head there anyway.

487
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:01,742
Yeah, fucking idiot.

488
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:03,978
[Kano laughs]

489
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,947
How you planning
on getting us there?

490
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,815
Oh, I got a friend
with a plane.

491
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,884
- You got friends?
- Eh, fuck you, pretty boy.

492
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:11,853
I'm a popular guy.

493
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,855
Everyone loves me.

494
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:15,657
[snorts]

495
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,528
[spits]

496
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:21,763
Ooh. [clicks tongue]

497
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,567
Oh, bloody garden gnomes,

498
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:27,735
they give me the creeps.

499
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:31,872
You're gonna give that guy
three million dollars?

500
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:33,907
Fuck, no.

501
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,175
I live in this shit hole.

502
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,143
You think
I got three million dollars?

503
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:38,779
[dramatic music playing]

504
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:58,967
[imperceptible]

505
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:03,871
[gasps]

506
00:38:03,903 --> 00:38:05,106
[Kano] There I was
trying to shove

507
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,074
this guy's nuts
down his throat.

508
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:08,675
And all I kept thinking about

509
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,477
is what should I get
for me mum for Christmas?

510
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,614
Your mom's been dead
for 30 fucking years, mate.

511
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:14,849
Kid can dream. Can't he?

512
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:17,217
Hey, you're out of it.

513
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,086
You okay?

514
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,689
- Yeah.
- All right.

515
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:23,157
Thank you for flying Air Kano,

516
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,525
I know you had
fuck all choices.

517
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,727
Afraid time's up.

518
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,863
Time to jump out
of this shit box.

519
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:29,964
Come on, let's go.

520
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:37,103
First time?

521
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:38,806
Yeah. What gave it away?

522
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:39,974
You'll be okay.

523
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:41,909
Just gotta jump,
count to three,

524
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,710
pull this side.

525
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:45,512
All right. Simple. But how...

526
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:47,614
- Well, do or die, princess.
- [screams]

527
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:49,784
- What?
- You're fucking kidding me.

528
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,095
So how close are we?

529
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,864
[Kano] Twenty-seven,
twenty-eight K's.

530
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:04,030
[Blade] What?

531
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:05,532
Maybe thirty to be safe.

532
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:07,534
Straight up, thirty-two, eh?

533
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:09,604
We say thirty-five
there'll be no surprises.

534
00:39:11,572 --> 00:39:12,539
Oh, shit.

535
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,544
Fuck this. I need a break.

536
00:39:17,577 --> 00:39:19,581
- [groans]
- [Cole] You just took a break.

537
00:39:20,947 --> 00:39:22,750
Too many beers, huh?

538
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:24,518
Give me that GPS.
I'm taking point.

539
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,053
Ah, let's look
at the score board, shall we?

540
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:27,587
I got us the plane.

541
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:29,222
I know how to find

542
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:31,525
your precious little mountain
retreat or whatever it is.

543
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,927
I killed the lizard man.

544
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,864
Huh? Any of you rip
anyone's heart out? Hey.

545
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,932
[laughs] I think I know
what's going on here.

546
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:40,902
You're jealous, girlie,

547
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:42,168
of me little marking.

548
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:43,838
Hey, I'm talking to you.

549
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,307
If you want it so much,

550
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,875
all you got to do is kill me.

551
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:48,876
Take it.

552
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,280
Now, come on. What do you say?

553
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:53,515
You want to dance?

554
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,288
- It's your blood.
- Attagirl.

555
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:02,023
Hmm.

556
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:03,858
[both grunting]

557
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:16,771
Go on then, take it.

558
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:19,541
[panting]

559
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,708
You're so close.

560
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:23,711
Just take it. Take it!

561
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,215
Nah.

562
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,319
Yeah, that's why
you don't have one of these.

563
00:40:32,353 --> 00:40:34,688
You don't have
the mongrel in you.

564
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:35,623
[Kano laughs]

565
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:38,125
You good?

566
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:39,226
[Kano sighs]

567
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:09,123
[Kang] At last.

568
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:18,832
Okay, that's far enough,
MC Hammer.

569
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:20,835
[screams]

570
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:23,671
[coughs]

571
00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:24,672
I'm not your enemy.

572
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:30,311
I'm Liu Kang from
the Shaolin Order of Light.

573
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:32,012
You're one of
the champions.

574
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:33,980
Yes, from Earthrealm.

575
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:36,751
Finally, you have come
to seek out Raiden's...

576
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,818
[stuttering] Fuck the temple.

577
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:41,955
Wait... You just shot
a fireball out of your hand.

578
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:42,990
How'd you do that?

579
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:47,862
Hang on. Hang the fuck on.

580
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:50,398
Does that mean I'm gonna get
superpowers at any point?

581
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:51,398
It does, doesn't it?

582
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,302
- There's much to learn.
- The fuck.

583
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:56,204
But not here.

584
00:41:57,271 --> 00:41:58,139
Follow me.

585
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,043
[Blade scoffs]

586
00:42:08,414 --> 00:42:10,384
[Kano] Hey, David Copperfield.
Hang on.

587
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:12,987
Just teach me
how you do it.

588
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:19,124
[dramatic music playing]

589
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:30,371
There it is...

590
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:31,905
what you've been
searching for.

591
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:38,112
It wasn't always
like this.

592
00:42:38,144 --> 00:42:39,780
For thousands of years,

593
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:43,217
this temple was a holy place
of worship.

594
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,454
It is essential that we begin your
training for the next tournament.

595
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:49,456
[Cole] This doesn't feel like
a tournament.

596
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:51,725
So far it feels like an ambush.

597
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,728
[Kang] We don't have much time.

598
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,762
We will not see
another full moon

599
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:57,130
before the tournament begins.

600
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,139
Come, come. Through here.

601
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:16,349
[Kano] Now what?

602
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:17,384
You're gonna make a door appear
out of nowhere?

603
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:20,855
[rumbling]

604
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,425
[Kano] Oh.

605
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,128
[chuckles]

606
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:28,995
[Kano] I'll give you that.
It's pretty good.

607
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,067
[Blade] Wow.

608
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,438
[faint crowd screams]

609
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:41,275
I knew it.

610
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,778
It's all real.

611
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:47,947
These murals are the living
history of Mortal Kombat.

612
00:43:47,981 --> 00:43:49,483
[scoffs]

613
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:51,284
[Kano sarcastically] Now
this one really speaks to me.

614
00:43:55,188 --> 00:43:57,223
- [roaring in distance]
- [Blade] This is Outworld.

615
00:43:57,257 --> 00:43:59,894
Yes, the most brutal...

616
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:02,028
and murderous
of all the realms.

617
00:44:03,896 --> 00:44:05,132
Our greatest enemy.

618
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:10,538
- [sword slicing]
- [man screaming]

619
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,505
[man speaks indistinctly]

620
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:13,940
[faint indistinct whispering]

621
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:23,450
[Kang] We must
start training now.

622
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:27,121
Before our mortal enemies from
the Outworld come for us.

623
00:44:27,153 --> 00:44:31,025
The fate of Earthrealm
is in our hands.

624
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:33,460
There are not many of us
with the marking left.

625
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:36,329
So you must train harder,

626
00:44:36,362 --> 00:44:38,364
and faster.

627
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:41,501
Because if you fail
to discover your inner power,

628
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:44,938
you will never defeat
your opponent.

629
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:49,410
They will ravage everything
you hold dear.

630
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:52,880
There will be no mercy.

631
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:57,483
You must fight
without question.

632
00:44:57,516 --> 00:45:00,554
The Dragon has swallowed
many before us.

633
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:03,324
Now put that back.

634
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:06,492
Put what back?

635
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:07,594
[bell chiming]

636
00:45:19,472 --> 00:45:21,576
Jax! Hey, Jax.

637
00:45:23,943 --> 00:45:27,614
[breathing shakily]
Oh, God.

638
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:30,416
[Kang] It has been
my charge to gather

639
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:32,352
all the champions of Earth.

640
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:34,989
By the time I found Jax,
I was too late.

641
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:38,659
Well, is he gonna live?

642
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:40,561
The ice...

643
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:43,063
It cauterized his wounds.

644
00:45:43,096 --> 00:45:45,365
We've sourced every realm

645
00:45:45,398 --> 00:45:46,467
to find a way to heal him.

646
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:49,903
- What can I do?
- Be patient.

647
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:52,472
[speaking foreign language]

648
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:58,079
Give them time
to do their work.

649
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,987
We must go.
He awaits.

650
00:46:07,653 --> 00:46:09,623
[rumbling]

651
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:18,565
The great protector,
Lord Raiden.

652
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:29,143
My lord, I've gathered the
remaining champions of Earth.

653
00:46:35,983 --> 00:46:38,185
[Raiden] This is what
I have to work with?

654
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:44,158
You are in no physical
or mental shape to fight.

655
00:46:45,992 --> 00:46:47,394
You don't even have a marking.

656
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:53,133
[Kano] All right, hang on.

657
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,169
What about me, Gandalf,
where's my fortune cookie jar...

658
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:56,170
[lightning crackling]

659
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:00,173
- Powerless, arrogant.
- [groans]

660
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,143
The time has long passed.

661
00:47:03,175 --> 00:47:05,679
Our enemies have claimed
nine straight victories.

662
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:11,117
One more victory and Outworld will
gain control over Earth forever,

663
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,587
and Shang Tsung will enslave
the entire human race.

664
00:47:14,621 --> 00:47:15,489
[coughs]

665
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:18,025
Sorry, what did I miss?

666
00:47:21,695 --> 00:47:23,397
[Cole] They tried
to kill my family.

667
00:47:24,664 --> 00:47:25,533
Help us.

668
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,235
There's nothing for you here,

669
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:30,703
only death.

670
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:32,373
Well, I'm willing to die
for my family.

671
00:47:35,342 --> 00:47:37,244
[Raiden] Let's see if you have
what it takes.

672
00:47:51,057 --> 00:47:52,393
[whooshes]

673
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:57,330
[rumbling]

674
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:17,150
[grunts]

675
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:20,687
[Kang groaning]

676
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:22,722
[crunching]

677
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,326
- [slicing]
- [yelping]

678
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,360
[swooshing]

679
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:36,737
[panting]

680
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:39,206
[speaking foreign language]

681
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:59,793
The time has come
to end this.

682
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:05,599
Take whatever trophies
you desire...

683
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,703
- but their souls are mine.
- [Raiden] Silence!

684
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:11,771
[lightning crackling]

685
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:17,543
I've come to claim your world.

686
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:19,580
You're too late, Raiden.

687
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:23,182
It is forbidden to claim victory
until the tournament begins.

688
00:49:23,215 --> 00:49:25,551
You are correct, Thunder God.

689
00:49:25,585 --> 00:49:28,722
The conflict outside of Mortal
Kombat is not forbidden.

690
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:32,392
- [munching] -Besides the other
guards are too lazy to stop me.

691
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:35,229
I have come for your souls.

692
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:37,765
You will leave this place
at once, sorcerer.

693
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:43,269
These are your champions?

694
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,209
Kill them.

695
00:49:49,242 --> 00:49:50,477
[blades swishing]

696
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,512
- [Raiden grunts]
- [thudding]

697
00:49:51,545 --> 00:49:52,480
[roaring]

698
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:55,315
[lightning crackling]

699
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:04,324
You think these tricks
will protect you forever?

700
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,760
Only a matter of time.

701
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:08,828
[electrical buzzing]

702
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:32,619
[metallic thud]

703
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:42,461
[mumbles] This totally make up
my superpowers.

704
00:50:42,494 --> 00:50:44,463
Think I get it now.
It's kind of like a box of chocolates.

705
00:50:44,496 --> 00:50:46,632
You never know what you're gonna get.
Is it gonna be fireballs?

706
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:49,469
Is it gonna be
lightning, huh?

707
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:51,771
Could be shit. Could be, uh...
Could be a frisbee hat.

708
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,373
No offense, whoever you are.

709
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:58,277
The name is Kung Lao.

710
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,547
Descendant of
the Great Kung Lao.

711
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:03,217
[Lao] The grand champion
of the Order of Light.

712
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:05,251
Never heard of him.

713
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:07,421
[Kang] Listen carefully.

714
00:51:07,454 --> 00:51:09,490
Your training has begun.
Come.

715
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:11,824
[electrical buzzing]

716
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:13,961
[Kang] Your inner power
comes from your arcana,

717
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:16,496
a gift from the marking
of the Dragon.

718
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:19,632
The point of your training is
for you to unlock that power.

719
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:23,737
Without it, defeating Outworld
will be impossible.

720
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:27,840
Kung Lao and I have discovered
our arcana.

721
00:51:27,873 --> 00:51:30,443
In the fight pit,
you'll discover yours.

722
00:51:36,016 --> 00:51:37,416
You may enter.

723
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:38,718
[Kano chuckling]
Let's do the damn thing.

724
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:40,920
[applauds]
I want your fireballs.

725
00:51:40,954 --> 00:51:43,557
- There is no guarantee...
- So, Liu, instead of fireballs,

726
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,358
what else is gonna shoot out of my hands?
Like, knives or guns...

727
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:47,727
Hey, do you
ever shut up?

728
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,795
You're welcome to
stay with us, Miss Blade.

729
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:52,532
But the training area
is for the chosen ones only.

730
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:54,333
[scoffing] Fucking whoops.

731
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:55,569
Well, hang on.

732
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:56,670
We wouldn't be here
without her.

733
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:58,639
She's one of us.

734
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:00,840
A fighter without a marking
can never achieve their arcana.

735
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:04,777
And a fighter without an arcana
is a liability to the others.

736
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:06,780
Yeah, liability.

737
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:10,718
All right. Bye, bye, blondie.

738
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:14,054
All right, guys.
Little less of this.

739
00:52:14,086 --> 00:52:15,588
Little more of this.
Come on.

740
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:16,889
[Lao] Be still and listen.

741
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:17,857
[whispering] Fuckin' hell.

742
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:33,507
[gasping]

743
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:36,576
[Blade] Jax.

744
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:37,943
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

745
00:52:37,976 --> 00:52:38,846
I'm here.

746
00:52:39,913 --> 00:52:40,813
Hi, buddy.

747
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:43,416
[breathing heavily]

748
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:48,922
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

749
00:52:48,954 --> 00:52:49,822
You just lay down.

750
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:55,596
What happened?

751
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:04,637
[Kang] All you can do now
is test your might.

752
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,072
We have no time to lose.

753
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:07,975
You must unlock your arcana.

754
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:12,645
[both grunting]

755
00:53:38,771 --> 00:53:39,739
[swishing]

756
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:44,978
[metallic clang]

757
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:49,682
[Cole yelping]

758
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:52,086
[impact grunt]

759
00:53:55,155 --> 00:53:57,691
[Cole groaning]

760
00:53:57,724 --> 00:54:00,827
[Lao] In Mortal Kombat,
talent will only get you so far.

761
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:04,063
[Kano applauding]

762
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:06,466
[mockingly]
No, that was great. Really.

763
00:54:06,498 --> 00:54:08,501
Good stuff.

764
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:11,704
You know, maybe your arcana is
getting your ass kicked by a hat.

765
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:13,106
[chuckles]

766
00:54:15,074 --> 00:54:16,476
[inhales]

767
00:54:17,643 --> 00:54:18,745
[exhales]

768
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:26,820
Fight!

769
00:54:28,153 --> 00:54:29,623
No Harry Potter shit,
all right?

770
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:32,759
[yelps and groans]

771
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:35,863
[Kano] Cute.

772
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:37,898
Real cute.

773
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:39,699
[laughs] Let's see.
Throwing down again?

774
00:54:39,731 --> 00:54:41,067
[grunting]

775
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:43,970
Is that the only move
you know, mate?

776
00:54:44,003 --> 00:54:45,172
- [Kang grunts]
- [screams] Fuck.

777
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:46,907
[groans]

778
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:53,980
Yeah, yeah.
Put a fucking shirt on, Magic Mike.

779
00:54:54,012 --> 00:54:56,715
It seems as though we have
our work cut out for us.

780
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:57,784
[Kano] I was just warming up.

781
00:54:58,885 --> 00:54:59,920
[Kang] Let me see your wound.

782
00:55:02,521 --> 00:55:03,523
[Cole groaning]

783
00:55:04,523 --> 00:55:05,458
Liu...

784
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:08,528
How do I find my arcana?

785
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:11,632
It must come
from your soul.

786
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:14,867
Whatever it is that drives you.

787
00:55:16,668 --> 00:55:17,971
So how did you find
your arcana?

788
00:55:19,905 --> 00:55:23,610
Unlike Kung Lao,
I was just a worthless stray.

789
00:55:25,143 --> 00:55:27,680
For reasons beyond my ken,

790
00:55:27,713 --> 00:55:31,918
Master Bo' Rai Cho found me
half dead in the gutter

791
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:37,057
- and brought me to the Wu Shi Academy.
- [groans]

792
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,960
There, I was given a purpose.

793
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:41,728
A brother...

794
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:43,197
Kung Lao.

795
00:55:44,597 --> 00:55:46,533
And I met Lord Raiden.

796
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:49,869
Kung Lao and I
have served together.

797
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:54,673
Upon graduation,
I was given a name of a man.

798
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:57,577
He was a purveyor
of rare things.

799
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:00,880
Children.

800
00:56:03,682 --> 00:56:06,219
Orphans like me.

801
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,623
He had a marking,

802
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:11,224
so I chose to
take it from him.

803
00:56:13,025 --> 00:56:15,995
And in that moment,
my arcana came forth.

804
00:56:16,028 --> 00:56:17,563
- [fire blazing]
- [groans]

805
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:21,935
[men grunting]

806
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:29,041
[swishing]

807
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,211
[coughing]

808
00:56:35,914 --> 00:56:39,818
[smacking]

809
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:41,521
[Blade] Come on, Major.
I've seen better than that.

810
00:56:42,288 --> 00:56:45,291
Again. Again. Again!

811
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:47,159
- [effort grunt]
- Come on, you got this.

812
00:56:47,193 --> 00:56:48,295
[grunting]

813
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:50,630
These don't work.

814
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:54,867
These are not me.

815
00:57:03,775 --> 00:57:04,710
I'm useless.

816
00:57:06,144 --> 00:57:07,179
Why even bring me here?

817
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:10,784
I can't help.

818
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:18,724
My first day of training...

819
00:57:18,757 --> 00:57:20,826
We had to run 20 miles.

820
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,728
[chuckles]

821
00:57:22,695 --> 00:57:24,164
Thought I was gonna die.

822
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:25,932
I wanted to quit,

823
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:28,969
but all I ever wanted
was to be accepted by you...

824
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,804
as an elite fighter.

825
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:31,938
You remember what you told me?

826
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:34,641
How do we keep going?

827
00:57:34,673 --> 00:57:37,143
And you proved to yourself
that you can do this or...

828
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:38,679
regret it for the rest
of your life.

829
00:57:42,215 --> 00:57:43,750
Are you trying to tell me
something, soldier?

830
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:46,752
Get off your fucking ass,
Major.

831
00:57:47,753 --> 00:57:48,621
[laughs]

832
00:57:53,826 --> 00:57:55,862
Miss Sonya, sit, please.

833
00:57:57,929 --> 00:57:59,265
- Ah, thank you.
- [Kang] Eat.

834
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:02,802
Cole, how's your arm?

835
00:58:02,835 --> 00:58:04,737
[groans] It's healing up.

836
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:05,972
[Kang] Eat more, heal fast.

837
00:58:06,005 --> 00:58:07,807
More training tomorrow.

838
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,643
You're fucking
kidding me, aren't you?

839
00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:11,677
[laughing] Fucking hell.

840
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,178
Is he on our side?

841
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:14,880
[sarcastically]
Those are great, mate.

842
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:16,249
They make those
in men's sizes?

843
00:58:17,382 --> 00:58:19,251
[laughing]

844
00:58:19,284 --> 00:58:21,153
[snaps fingers]
Top knot, at the end.

845
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:22,721
What's his name?
Kung Pao.

846
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:23,690
Pass us some fucking egg roll,
would you?

847
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:26,192
[speaking foreign language]

848
00:58:26,224 --> 00:58:28,827
Your ear is painted on, mate?
Egg roll.

849
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,096
There you go.
Good boy.

850
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:35,300
- [chuckling]
- [Blade chuckling]

851
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:38,003
Maybe you should lay off
the egg rolls,

852
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:39,405
seeing how you wouldn't be
ready to fight

853
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:41,074
if you had 100 days to train.

854
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,143
[Lao] I'll dumb it down
for you.

855
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,346
Fat, lazy pig.

856
00:58:46,378 --> 00:58:47,913
What did you say?

857
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:48,882
Terrible fighter.

858
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,286
Zero skill.

859
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:55,188
You got a death wish, mate?

860
00:58:55,221 --> 00:58:57,423
Combat takes intelligence.

861
00:58:58,990 --> 00:58:59,893
But you...

862
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:03,028
You're like a dog.

863
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,297
A dog who fails
his training classes.

864
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:08,367
Well, how about I take that stupid
fucking sombrero you're wearing,

865
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,936
shove it so far up your ass,
you start speaking Spanish.

866
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:11,971
How does that sound?

867
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:14,440
You can try.

868
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:15,942
I just fucking might.

869
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:18,178
Let me ask you this.

870
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,878
Why would you
jeopardize the goodwill

871
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:22,848
of the only chance
of your survival?

872
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:25,318
Princess, why don't you try
being one of them silent monks?

873
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:27,019
No, no, you misunderstand.

874
00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:28,353
He is here to save you

875
00:59:28,387 --> 00:59:30,323
because you cannot
save yourself.

876
00:59:30,356 --> 00:59:33,093
- Oh, fuck, here we go.
- You're like...

877
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:35,328
an aggressive little bunny.

878
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,730
- Soft and useless.
- [all chuckling]

879
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:40,066
Angry mentally, physically.

880
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:41,901
You should be on your knees
before this man.

881
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:43,236
[Blade and Jax chuckling]

882
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:46,039
I've a better idea.

883
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:47,774
How about you two
get on your knees

884
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:49,308
and take turns
sucking my sack?

885
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:51,478
[chopsticks clang]

886
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:54,514
Do you have any fucking
idea who you're talking to?

887
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:56,849
I'm wanted in over
35 countries for shit,

888
00:59:56,882 --> 00:59:59,118
you fucking ballerinas
couldn't even imagine.

889
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:00,920
- [thuds]
- You're angry.

890
01:00:00,952 --> 01:00:02,989
Oh! Fucking nothing
gets by you, does it?

891
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,192
Good.

892
01:00:07,092 --> 01:00:08,260
You should be.

893
01:00:08,293 --> 01:00:09,261
You failure.

894
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:12,798
[softly] Failure?

895
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,503
Fucking failure?

896
01:00:16,536 --> 01:00:19,304
Let me educate you,
motherfucker. I'm Kano.

897
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:21,474
I'm the black fucking dragon.

898
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:23,143
And who are you two, huh?

899
01:00:23,175 --> 01:00:25,010
You're some fucking
cave-dwelling hippy,

900
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:26,311
twirling his anal beads,

901
01:00:26,344 --> 01:00:28,981
taking orders
from this Wu Shu wanker,

902
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:31,116
who wears
a hubcap as a helmet.

903
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,485
Now, sit down!

904
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:36,056
Shut up and pass me
a fucking egg roll.

905
01:00:36,922 --> 01:00:38,357
[buzzing]

906
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:39,860
[objects clattering]

907
01:00:41,393 --> 01:00:42,461
[breathing heavily]

908
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,472
That was it, wasn't it?

909
01:00:52,505 --> 01:00:55,842
You all saw that? [laughing]

910
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,876
[excitedly]
Laser beam!

911
01:00:57,909 --> 01:01:00,312
It's better than fireballs,
you pussy.

912
01:01:00,346 --> 01:01:02,349
[laughing hysterically]

913
01:01:03,148 --> 01:01:04,917
Come on, Kano.

914
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:06,485
I knew I'd get mine first.

915
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:07,953
[laughing]

916
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:10,156
[exhales]

917
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:12,057
[electrical buzzing]

918
01:01:14,893 --> 01:01:17,396
[Kang] We are running
out of time, Cole.

919
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:19,532
Focus on what you can't deny.

920
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:22,034
Find the truth in you.

921
01:01:23,568 --> 01:01:25,271
The pain.

922
01:01:25,304 --> 01:01:26,506
It's the ultimate catalyst.

923
01:01:29,242 --> 01:01:31,177
[groans]

924
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,945
- Again.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... Hold on.

925
01:01:32,978 --> 01:01:34,279
Does it have to be him? I...

926
01:01:34,313 --> 01:01:35,282
[both grunting]

927
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:43,489
You know, I see a little bit
of arcana there.

928
01:01:43,521 --> 01:01:44,891
Give me one more crack at it.

929
01:01:44,923 --> 01:01:47,059
[Kang] Focus on the pain, Cole.

930
01:01:47,092 --> 01:01:49,161
- I'm focusing, nothing's happening. It hurts...
- [Kano] Stick with it.

931
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:50,197
Again.

932
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,432
[groans]

933
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:55,101
Yeah, you're right.
Nothing's happening.

934
01:01:56,268 --> 01:01:57,402
You're as lazy, ya?

935
01:01:57,436 --> 01:01:58,872
[panting]

936
01:02:01,907 --> 01:02:03,175
[electrical buzzing]

937
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:05,545
[exhales]

938
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:13,252
What are you looking at?

939
01:02:17,523 --> 01:02:18,625
They're beautiful.

940
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:19,592
You're a lucky man.

941
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:22,461
Thanks.

942
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,333
You have failed
to find your arcana.

943
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:30,302
Without it, you are a liability
to the others.

944
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:33,939
So where did this come from?

945
01:02:33,972 --> 01:02:36,909
And why am I the only champion that
had the marking since I was born?

946
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:40,246
Your marking comes
from your lineage, Cole.

947
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:41,914
Lineage?

948
01:02:41,947 --> 01:02:44,150
I'm an orphan
from the south side of Chicago.

949
01:02:44,182 --> 01:02:48,188
You're a descendant of one of the
greatest ninjas to ever walk the Earth.

950
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:50,990
Hanzo Hasashi.

951
01:02:51,623 --> 01:02:53,692
[sword swishing]

952
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:57,297
He was murdered along
with his wife and eldest son

953
01:02:57,329 --> 01:02:59,431
by the same assassin
that hunts you now.

954
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:01,001
Sub-Zero.

955
01:03:03,501 --> 01:03:07,507
[Raiden] <i>The moment he died,
Hanzo descended into the Netherrealm,</i>

956
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:09,308
<i>the furthest reaches of hell,</i>

957
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:11,644
<i>endlessly searching
for revenge.</i>

958
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:14,646
<i>But his bloodline lived on.</i>

959
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:17,951
<i>I rescued Hanzo's
only surviving child...</i>

960
01:03:17,983 --> 01:03:20,052
<i>and hid her in the one place</i>

961
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:21,520
<i>he wouldn't think to find her.</i>

962
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:26,425
For centuries,
the Hasashi marking

963
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,294
has passed down
through your ancestors.

964
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:32,699
I had a hope the power in your
bloodline was still strong in you.

965
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:36,135
Now I know that's not the case.

966
01:03:38,103 --> 01:03:39,438
[lightning crackling]

967
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:43,308
[lightning buzzing]

968
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:45,512
Go, be with your family.

969
01:03:46,746 --> 01:03:49,215
Cole, do not give up on this.

970
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:51,951
I'm sorry.

971
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:02,262
[thunder rumbling]

972
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:20,512
[Nitara screeching]

973
01:04:27,286 --> 01:04:28,521
[Tsung] Welcome.

974
01:04:33,425 --> 01:04:36,429
The great hunter, Nitara.

975
01:04:36,461 --> 01:04:40,233
She is beautiful, isn't she?

976
01:04:40,266 --> 01:04:42,601
Yeah. That screech
is a real turn on.

977
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:53,780
My loyal warriors, Kabal,
General Reiko,

978
01:04:53,813 --> 01:04:57,583
I have seen the so-called
champions of Earth realm,

979
01:04:57,615 --> 01:05:01,086
and they're no match
for all of you.

980
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,188
We are on
the precipice of victory

981
01:05:03,222 --> 01:05:05,691
and taking Earth realm forever.

982
01:05:05,724 --> 01:05:08,227
But we must strike now.

983
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:11,397
Raiden has prevented entry
into his temple.

984
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:13,732
I must find a way
to bring his shield down

985
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:16,635
in order to obliterate
our opposition.

986
01:05:16,668 --> 01:05:18,070
I think I can help.

987
01:05:18,103 --> 01:05:19,638
Did you see a guy down there?

988
01:05:19,672 --> 01:05:21,706
A complete fucking asshole.

989
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:23,508
Answers to Kano.

990
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:25,177
- Kano.
- Yeah.

991
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,446
He's the reason I live
in an iron lung.

992
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,483
He's a low life,
piece of shit scumbag.

993
01:05:30,516 --> 01:05:32,085
You're going to love him.

994
01:05:32,117 --> 01:05:33,385
[gate opening]

995
01:05:37,856 --> 01:05:39,759
Prince Goro.

996
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:43,328
It is an honor to have
Shokan blood on our side.

997
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:46,532
Now we shall end this prophecy
once and for all.

998
01:06:09,188 --> 01:06:10,623
Well, well, well.

999
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:14,393
You backstabbing, two-faced
ugly motherfucker.

1000
01:06:16,594 --> 01:06:19,131
- Kabal.
- Hey, Kano.

1001
01:06:19,164 --> 01:06:20,599
It's been a while.

1002
01:06:20,632 --> 01:06:22,167
You getting enough sleep, mate?

1003
01:06:22,201 --> 01:06:24,704
Your eyes are a little
redder than usual.

1004
01:06:24,737 --> 01:06:26,739
You've got a big mouth
for someone who's standing

1005
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:29,641
on the wrong side of
the electric fence, tough guy.

1006
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:31,310
You working
for the other fella?

1007
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:33,678
- That wizard?
- Working with him, not for him.

1008
01:06:33,711 --> 01:06:36,248
And trust me, it has its perks.

1009
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:37,416
Like what?

1010
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:39,318
This is fucking tragic.

1011
01:06:39,351 --> 01:06:40,586
Look at yourself.

1012
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,655
You used to be someone to fear.

1013
01:06:42,688 --> 01:06:45,825
You've fallen down a long way
since you led the Black Dragon.

1014
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:47,326
Don't tell me about
the Black Dragon.

1015
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:48,760
I am the Black Dragon.

1016
01:06:48,793 --> 01:06:51,530
Which one's your boss?
Let me guess. The blonde?

1017
01:06:51,563 --> 01:06:53,699
That mask cutting off your
air supply, you dumb prick?

1018
01:06:53,731 --> 01:06:56,235
I don't take orders
from anyone, Kabal.

1019
01:06:56,268 --> 01:06:57,670
Then you're on the wrong side.

1020
01:06:57,702 --> 01:07:00,206
Fight with us and you could
have more money

1021
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:01,807
than you know what to do with.

1022
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,376
Hell, you could turn this
old temple into your own casino

1023
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:06,344
if you wanted to.

1024
01:07:06,378 --> 01:07:08,748
Just name your price,
then double it and double it again.

1025
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,349
What are you
waiting for, asshole?

1026
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:13,452
[clears throat] So what would
I need to do?

1027
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:18,758
[thuds]

1028
01:07:31,503 --> 01:07:32,639

[ominous music playing]

1032

What is that?

1033
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:28,293
[Kano] You know, the problem
with these new lightning sticks,

1034
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:33,832
they just don't make them
like they used to.

1035
01:08:37,368 --> 01:08:38,970
[chuckles]

1036
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:41,306
What? You didn't think you'd
actually change me, did you?

1037
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:45,511
The undoing of the prophecy
has begun.

1038

[grunts]

1039
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:01,793
Back inside.

Dad!

1041
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:06,032

I'm the one you want.

You see that!

01:09:18,911 --> 01:09:19,979
Okay.

This is not the blood
of the Chosen One.

Your death has no worth.

No, Mom!

1094
01:14:12,037 --> 01:14:13,072
Aah!

1095
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,908
[Allison] Cole!

1096
01:14:16,942 --> 01:14:17,842

You okay?

1113
01:16:30,509 --> 01:16:32,377
We're fine. Are you okay?

1114
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:33,412
Yeah.

1115
01:16:34,445 --> 01:16:35,881

- It's okay.

1124
01:17:57,429 --> 01:17:58,864
It's a doorway back...

1125
01:18:00,164 --> 01:18:01,266
It's not over.

1126
01:18:08,206 --> 01:18:10,108
Impossible.

1127
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,178
Thank you for helping
my fighter find his arcana.

1128
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:18,818
After 4000 years, the Hasashi
bloodline still lives on.

1129
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:21,086

No!

1144
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:28,619
[Blade] Where are we?

1145
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:30,689
[Raiden] We are in the void.

1146
01:19:30,721 --> 01:19:34,025
It is the realm
between your world and mine.

1147
01:19:34,059 --> 01:19:35,961
Shang Tsung
cannot follow us here.

1148
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,177
If we're to die...

1149
01:19:53,478 --> 01:19:55,480
it was supposed
to be together.

1150
01:19:57,414 --> 01:19:59,518
I'm sorry, Liu Kang.

1151
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,289
Without Kung Lao,

1152
01:20:06,757 --> 01:20:08,193
Earthrealm is lost.

1153
01:20:10,028 --> 01:20:11,530
[Jax] Lord Raiden.

1154
01:20:11,563 --> 01:20:13,332
Why couldn't you save him?

1155
01:20:13,364 --> 01:20:15,032
All the Gods are forbidden

1156
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:18,403
from engaging in one realm's
war against another.

1157
01:20:18,435 --> 01:20:20,404
It is my job
to protect Earthrealm

1158
01:20:20,438 --> 01:20:23,042
but I cannot save
every soul within it.

1159
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:26,043
No.

1160
01:20:26,077 --> 01:20:29,114
It's not over,
we still need to fight.

1161
01:20:33,551 --> 01:20:35,587
Cole.

1162
01:20:35,619 --> 01:20:38,356
The blood on this blade
is your ancestors.

1163
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,659
Hanzo Hasashi's.

1164
01:20:40,692 --> 01:20:43,694
I took it from him
the day he died.

1165
01:20:43,728 --> 01:20:47,198
Use it and the spirit of Hanzo
fights with you.

1166
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:52,671
So what's the plan?

1167
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:56,240
We need to fight smarter.

1168
01:20:56,274 --> 01:20:57,509
We need to control the fight.

1169
01:20:58,208 --> 01:20:59,711
How?

1170
01:20:59,743 --> 01:21:01,278
I mean, they're better trained
and better prepared.

1171
01:21:01,311 --> 01:21:03,015
Plus they don't mind
breaking the rules.

1172
01:21:05,682 --> 01:21:07,386
We need to split them up.

1173
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:10,122
Lord Raiden,
can you send anyone anywhere?

1174
01:21:11,422 --> 01:21:12,724
Well, they don't want
a tournament.

1175
01:21:12,756 --> 01:21:14,091
Let's give them one.

1176
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,260
But let's do it our way.

1177
01:21:16,661 --> 01:21:18,163
Give me Reiko.

1178
01:21:18,195 --> 01:21:19,398
I got a score to settle.

1179
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:30,341
Hey, big boy!

1180
01:21:32,444 --> 01:21:34,213

01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:36,348
Sonya...

1182
01:21:36,381 --> 01:21:38,050
Please tell me I get
the bitch with the teeth.

1183
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:39,684
You get to take out
your old buddy, Kano.

1184
01:21:41,786 --> 01:21:43,387
I know I've seen you
kick his ass before,

1185
01:21:43,421 --> 01:21:45,524
but he's got a laser now.
Watch out for that.

1186
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:46,692
Oh, I got an idea.

1187
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,262
Honey, I'm home.

1188
01:21:50,295 --> 01:21:52,329
You and I will take
Mileena and Kabal.

1189
01:21:52,363 --> 01:21:54,332
I know this is
personal for you.

1190
01:21:54,364 --> 01:21:55,367
Are you ready?

1191
01:22:04,641 --> 01:22:05,711
[Kabal] You again.

1192
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:08,712
What about Sub-Zero?

1193
01:22:08,746 --> 01:22:10,681
Nobody's taking him
out one on one.

1194
01:22:10,715 --> 01:22:11,716
Yeah.

1195
01:22:11,748 --> 01:22:13,717
We save Sub-Zero for last.

1196
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:16,355
We take him out together
as a team.

Sit. I will warm you.

[Raiden] The prophecy
has been fulfilled.

1322
01:36:52,529 --> 01:36:56,400
Has the blood on your hands
taught you nothing?

1323
01:36:56,432 --> 01:37:00,971
[Tsung] No matter how many of
my people you put in the ground,

1324
01:37:01,005 --> 01:37:04,042
there will always be another
to take their place.

Today you have killed
my warriors

1326
01:37:09,412 --> 01:37:11,548
and you think you have won.

1327
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:14,652

is only another portal.

I will not bring fighters.

01:37:29,065 --> 01:37:31,568
I will bring armies.

1331
01:37:31,601 --> 01:37:34,404

Today we are victorious.

1337
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:55,158
But there are other enemies
to fight.

1338
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:58,763
We cannot let our guard down.

1339
01:38:00,296 --> 01:38:02,733
I'll assemble a new list
of champions.

1340
01:38:04,234 --> 01:38:05,670
You must find them.

1341
01:38:07,304 --> 01:38:08,239
Who's first?

1342
01:38:19,716 --> 01:38:23,387
My man,
I was just about to call you.

1343
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,756
I need you tomorrow night.

1344
01:38:25,788 --> 01:38:29,426
Sorry. My days fighting
for 200 bucks are done.

1345
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,529
Oh, you're finally quitting,
huh?

1346
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:34,798
Yeah, uh, something like that.

1347
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:36,367
Where're you gonna go?

1348
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:37,734
Hollywood.

1349
01:38:37,768 --> 01:38:41,471
Hollywood? What the hell's
in Hollywood?

1350
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:43,207
Not what, who.

1351
01:38:44,307 --> 01:38:45,275
It's been fun.
