and pushing him to the ground

356
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,871
he would take advantage
of such polite exit?

357
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:08,407
I-I was trying to avoid
bigger problems for Vojtech.

358
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:15,013
An NYPD cop just got killed
in New York.

359
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,349
Do you know
what that means, Piotr?

360
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:20,720
'Bad business.'

361
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:23,055
'They will shut down
all illegal activities'

362
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:25,725
'until they find
their cop killer.'

363
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:29,494
'Now, Stazek
doesn't have documents'

364
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,963
because Stazek doesn't exist

365
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,900
but you? NYPD will come for you.

366
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:38,904
'The best drug runner
in Vojtech.'

367
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:42,909
Oh, Piotr..

368
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:46,512
This is bad business for me.

369
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:47,881
I'm sorry, Mr. Klimek.

370
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,981
(Klimek)
Oh, no. Don't be sorry.

371
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:52,818
That feeling
doesn't take us anywhere.

372
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:54,921
We were talking
about business here.

373
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:56,823
Please, sit down.

374
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,025
[intense music]

375
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:04,297
Stazek tells me that

376
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:09,068
the cop was pointing the gun
i-in your face. Correct?

377
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,472
So, Stazek saved your life.

378
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:18,911
You now owe the price
of your life to Vojtech.

379
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:21,147
How much is your life worth?

380
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,385
I don't know.

381
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,554
Two words.

382
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,123
Closed market.

383
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,826
Bale Hill is a holding unit.

384
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:37,462
It sends prisoners
all over the state.

385
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:39,131
Hub.

386
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:41,601
We control the product
inside the Hill.

387
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,337
We control the supply
to prisons all over New York.

388
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,044
You did four years
at Bale Hill, right?

389
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:53,878
[Klimek sighs]

390
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:56,281
So if anyone
can get drugs inside

391
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,317
that's, that's you?

392
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,456
You, you want me
to control the supply inside..

393
00:23:04,523 --> 00:23:05,824
I mean, how would I do that?

394
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:08,059
Oh, you're a resourceful man.

395
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,729
With fentanyl, we can have

396
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:13,865
tens of thousands hooked
on our product.

397
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:16,134
They will work off their
debts to Vojtech.

398
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:20,006
Not only in prison,
but afterwards on the street.

399
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:24,644
I will own a fucking army.

400
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:27,247
[intense music]

401
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:36,556
[slurps]

402
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,691
[gulps]

403
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:39,992
[sighs]

404
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:43,996
You'll break your parole.

405
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:45,898
My lawyers will convince
the judge

406
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:48,433
to send you back to Bale Hill.

407
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,204
With good behavior, you'll
be released in five years max

408
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,708
and our debt
will be extinguished.

409
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,912
[music continues]

410
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:04,817
My life ain't worth that much.

411
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:06,685
[sighs]

412
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:08,887
How much are the lives

413
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:12,090
of your wife
and daughter worth to you?

414
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,063
'We found them'

415
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,365
'driving around your house.'

416
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:22,000
So frightened.

417
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,436
Suitcase filled with clothes.

418
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,438
[music continues]

419
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:34,814
You informed them
what happened at Techniska.

420
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:37,150
I-I just, I told them
to get out of the house.

421
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:38,883
Where-where are they?

422
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:40,553
(Klimek)
'Outside.'

423
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,254
'Waiting for you.'

424
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:45,089
Oh, don't worry.

425
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:48,793
Sofia and Anna will be okay..

426
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,497
...while you're inside.

427
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,601
[music continues]

428
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,538
Now..

429
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,276
...fuck off.

430
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:05,076

438
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:24,188
(Wilcox)
'You safe?'

439
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:25,725
You guys left me
in the fuckin' lurch.

440
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,259
You were supposed to take us
directly to The General.

441
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:29,894
(Pete)
'I can't call those shots.'

442
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,797
I'm only a soldier. I do
what I'm told. You understand?

443
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:34,400
Only a soldier? You just
brought in six Ki's for them.

444
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,168
It would've raised suspicion.

445
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:37,836
They would've stripped me naked.

446
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:39,570
(Wilcox) 'Look,
meet me tonight and hope we can'

447
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:41,273
salvage something,
otherwise four years

448
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,907
of hard work just
went down the fuckin' drain.

449
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:44,876
What the fuck you talkin'
about..

450
00:26:44,943 --> 00:26:46,412
Are you fuck..

451
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:49,382
(Nina) 'Anna,
do you wanna come and play?'

[exhales]

453
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:51,850
Do you wanna go play with Nina?

454
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:54,319
- Listen, sweetie...
- She's fine. Don't, now.

455
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:56,154
(Nina)
'I can see you.'

456
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:59,357
[sighs]

457
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,259
- 'Hi.'
- 'Hi, Nina, You wanna play?'

458
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:02,528
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

459
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,962
- Come on.
- Go the the backyard.

[door closes]

461
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:08,699
Why didn't you do
what I fuckin' told you to?

462
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:10,635
Just one sec.

463
00:27:10,702 --> 00:27:11,971
Why didn't you fuckin' leave?

464
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:13,673
Pete, you've got blood
all over you.

465
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:16,107
Answer my question.
Why didn't you protect Anna?

466
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:17,875
I wanna know what's going on.

467
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:19,345
Why didn't you protect Anna?

468
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,880
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- I don't wanna hear sorry.

469
00:27:20,945 --> 00:27:22,314
I don't wanna hear
fuckin' sorry.

470
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:24,650
You were supposed to take Anna
away from there, 1 p.m.

471
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,218
You think these people
would have a fuckin' problem

472
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,319
in killing the both of you?

473
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:29,087
[yells]
We tried.

474
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,090
[crying]
We fuckin' tried!

475
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,591
We kept driving around the block

476
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:34,159
hoping you'd be back.

477
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,728
Fuck you!

Driver's license says
it's Carlos Harrera.

494
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,001
His real name was Daniel Gomez.

495
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,202
Who the fuck are you?

496
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,337
Detective Edward Grens,
organized crime.

497
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:30,241
- He was one of mine.
- 'What happened here?'

498
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:31,743
He was supposed to be
a low-level buy

499
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:32,778
off the street tip.

500
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:35,279
They cut his throat,
pulled out his tongue.

501
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,182
They knew he was a cop.

502
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:39,152
'What'd you say his name was?'

00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:40,920

- Hey.
- Hey.

509
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:51,256
Thanks for takin' me here.
It's so romantic of you.

510
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:52,658
Yeah, dig in.

Shut up and eat, girl.

513
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:58,230
Homicide talk about anything?

514
00:30:58,297 --> 00:30:59,832
Like what?

515
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:03,167
I think Daniel's connection
was Polish.

516
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,836
Entire NYPD force
in this manhunt.

517
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:07,272
You don't see to sharing
this little fuckin' detail?

518
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:09,642
I gotta check my sources
before they get spooked

519
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:11,509
by the stampede.

520
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:14,078
You heard of Ryszard Klimek,
aka "The General."

521
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:15,681
Hmm. Polish crime boss, right?

522
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,850
Came over from Poland
after serving 20 years

523
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,485
in some shithole
Eastern European dungeon.

524
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:22,688
Now he's moving pieces
all over the board.

525
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,323
You think he has something to do
with Daniel?

[bike revving in distance]

527
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:29,928
Gomez was killed in this bar
in Little Poland.

528
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,496
'It's impossible
to trace its owners'

529
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:33,666

to The General.'

530
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:35,800
'Security cameras across
the street record Gomez'

531
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:39,770
entering at 11:09,
then at 11:27 this guy pops up.

532
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:43,674
Look at his body language. This
is a man who's just done bad.

533
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:46,412
- What do you need?
- Your badge.

534
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:47,947
IAS comin' after me.

535
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:49,313
Christ, Eddie.

536
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:51,717
I sent a man
when he wasn't ready.

537
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,019
This is on me.

538
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:57,522
[train brakes screeching]

539
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:00,893
Hold on a second. Watch my six.

540
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,395
That girl over there
was Daniel's source.

541
00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:08,667
Shit.

542
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:13,372
Shit. Help, help,
help, help, help!

543
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,807
'I'll give anyone $20
who stops the <i>puto</i> behind me!'

544
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,308
- Whoa!
- Help me out! Help me out!

545
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:18,844
- 'Move! Nigga, move!'
- Hold on.

546
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:20,446
NYPD! Get the fuck back!

547
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:23,316
(Grens) Tell me what happened to Daniel?
Tell me what happened to Daniel?

548
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:25,551
- Daniel...
- I don't know nothin'! Okay?

549
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:27,219
You got Gomez killed.

550
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:29,388
[indistinct chatter]

551
00:32:30,622 --> 00:32:32,057
Hey, Grens, you wanna talk to me
for a second?

552
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,526
Hey, Ed. Hey, Eddie,
you wanna talk to me outside?

553
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:36,461
Ed, outside, please?
Right now. Ed?

554
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:38,431
You're gonna be down.

555
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:44,236
What are you doing? You wanna
get these motherfuckers?

556
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:45,370
Oh, this bitch better talk.

557
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,805
You are scaring
the shit out of her.

558
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:49,641
You wanna calm down,
you wanna be professional

559
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,644
and let me do this, alright?

560
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:54,980
- Do what you gotta do.
- You stay here.

561
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:03,421
Hey, honey, you wanna
scooch over for a second please?

562
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:25,377
Stazek carved him up like that?

563
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:28,913
You think I'd fuckin' do that?

564
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,316
I'm just trying to find
a professional way to say this.

565
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:34,119
- Say what?
- You're fucked, Koslow.

566
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,454
- Wait, who the fuck is he?
- 'He's my boss.'

567
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:38,323
We tried to close the case
on The General

568
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,591
and bury this whole mess.

569
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:42,326
But Washington labelled
the case as weak

570
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,162
and took the embassy
off the table.

571
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:46,664
W-w-with all due respect, sir,
what the fuck you talkin'

572
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,000
about taking the embassy
off the table?

573
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,701
You just watched me
smuggle a dozen Ki's

574
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:52,703
through Polish diplomatic
pouches.

575
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,440
Deal was to give you enough
evidence so you could

576
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:56,208
indict The General,
which I have fuckin'

577
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,076
over-delivered at this point.

578
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,446
'Look, I've done my part.'

579
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:04,616
I-I want out.

580
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:08,353
Agent Wilcox here has a plan
to keep your status alive.

581
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,454
You should listen to her
and hope I like it

582
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:15,226
'cause in my book,
you're old news, my friend.

583
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:17,862
(Wilcox) 'Pete,
I think there's a way out of this.'

584
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,164
We go along with
The General's plan.

585
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:22,800
Evidence of fentanyl being
methodically distributed

586
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:25,871
inside a state prison
buries Ryszard Klimek for good.

587
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,974
And if that happens,
you're a free man.

588
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,577
[intense music]

589
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,081
The fuck you talking about?

590
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,753
Go back to prison?

591
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,623
That was never part of the plan.

592
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,358
And where is the part
of the plan where you become

593
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:49,094
an accessory to the murder
of an undercover policeman?

594
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:50,894
How am I an accessory
when I try to help him?

595
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,264
I mean, it's all on the tape.
And you guys put me there.

596
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,934
If I inform the NYPD
that I'm working with a witness

597
00:34:57,001 --> 00:35:00,204
to Officer Daniel Gomez's murder
you will be exposed.

598
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:04,477
If you're exposed,
General's case falls apart.

599
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:07,980
If I say no?

600
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:09,882
Prosecutor will have
you serve the remaining

601
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:11,849
twelve years of your sentence
and then tack on

602
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,052
whatever the NYPD pins on you.

603
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,387
[music continues]

604
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,224
[scoffs]

605
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:22,126
Some fuckin' bullshit.

606
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:24,730
I tried to help him.

607
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:28,000
You're a convicted felon who was
present when one of their own

608
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:29,701
was nearly beheaded.

609
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:33,639
You should think
of your family, Pete.

610
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:37,141
Look, once you're in charge
like The General wants

611
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,277
you just build a list
of all the inmates

612
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:41,046
and COs distributing for him.

613
00:35:41,112 --> 00:35:43,382
'Everyone's a potential nail
to crucify'

614
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:45,250
'that son of a bitch.'

615
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,686
I need to know you're in.

616
00:35:48,753 --> 00:35:51,289
[music continues]

617
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:04,536
And let me guess,
if I fuck up and bail

618
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,271
then I'm alone, right?

619
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:09,208
Don't fuck up.

620
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,244
[scoffs]

621
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:15,980
[dramatic music]

622
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,719
[car engine cranking]

623
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:32,097
[music continues]

624
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,023
(Wilcox on tape) 'Look, once you're
in charge, like The General wants'

625
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,925
'you just build a list
of all the inmates'

626
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:02,893
'and COs distributing for him.'

627
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,631
'Everyone's a potential nail to
crucify that son of a bitch.'

628
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,069
'I need to know you're in.'

629
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:15,440
(Peter on tape) 'And let me
guess, if I fuck up and bail'

630
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:18,344
'then I'm alone, right?'

631
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,944
(Wilcox on tape)
'Don't fuck up.'

632
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:26,184
[music continues]

633
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,393
(Kat)
'Yeah. Thank you.'

634
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,694
'Alright. Thank you.'

635
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:40,432
Yeah. Thank you.
Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

636
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:43,034
Okay. Got a couple
hits on the names.

637
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:45,570
First's a Pole,
street name's Stazek.

638
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:47,939
Real name unknown,
whereabouts unknown.

639
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:49,239
Unfortunately, that's it on him.

640
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:50,942
He was probably
recently imported.

641
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:52,677
Well, what about the American?

642
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,046
This is where
it gets interesting.

643
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:56,780
- Peter Koslow, he's a..
- What?

644
00:37:56,847 --> 00:38:00,184
"Complex. Born here,
parents immigrated from Poland.

645
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:01,552
"Gulf War vet, sniper.

646
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,288
"Served an additional
four tours in Iraq.

647
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:06,057
"Medals, medical history,
post-traumatic stress disorder..

648
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,625
"Crashed and burned
a few years ago.

649
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:10,528
"Manslaughter, got 20 years for
killing a guy in a bar fight.

650
00:38:10,596 --> 00:38:13,030
- Then it's weird.
- Weird, how?

651
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:15,534
Well, the file looks like
it's been redacted.

652
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,169
"Paroled from Bale Hill
after four

653
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:19,403
pending the full investigation
of new evidence."

654
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,871
Doesn't add up though.

655
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:23,408
Well, who could fuck with
his jacket like that.

656
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:26,577
Feds is my guess.

657
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,278
Can you dig into this Fed angle?

658
00:38:28,346 --> 00:38:30,081
You can't just fuckin'
poke around the Feds

659
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:31,850
like they're one of your
junkie hookers, Grens.

660
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,585
Look, I-I think this is the guy
who shot Daniel.

661
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:36,287
You said Bale Hill, right?

662
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:38,121
Bale Hill was part
of Daniel's cover story.

663
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:40,357
He liked it because
his old man served time there

664
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:42,861
but that was years ago,
if this guy was fresh out

665
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:45,096
he could've tripped
the kid up on something.

666
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:46,865
[indistinct chatter in distance]

667
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:48,766
Let me see what I can do.

668
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,039
Oh, shit. Got a breakfast date
with my sweetheart.

669
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:56,808
Wait, this guy you're runnin'
to, is this somebody special?

670
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:58,275
[chuckles]
You jealous?

671
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:00,578
I'm just hoping his name
ain't fucking Logan

672
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:03,282
or-or Chad or Brett.

673
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:08,119
Laila. Her name is Laila.

674
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,925
Laila?

675
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:15,560
Kat, why didn't you
tell me that?

676
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:16,960
[Kat laughs]

677
00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:19,529
La.. Yo, I-I should come with
you and Laila!

678
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:21,500
Y'all want a chaperone?

679
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:26,271
[knocking on door]

680
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:35,246
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk.

681
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:36,681
Important stuff.

682
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:38,015
Don't ever come knocking
on my fuckin' door.

683
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,952
Go to the garage.

684
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:47,358
[speaking in foreign language]

685
00:39:57,402 --> 00:39:59,737
[sighs]

686
00:39:59,804 --> 00:40:01,807
All night awake, fuck!

687
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:03,840
What happened?

688
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:05,943
I had to do some sweeping.

689
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,179
They guy you did time with.

690
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:09,847
- Whitey?
- Yeah, Whitey.

691
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:12,217
We found him 30 minutes ago.

692
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:15,920
Why don't you fuckin'
listen to me?

693
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:17,422
I told you, the cop
just used his name.

694
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:18,556
He's a straight guy.

695
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:21,025
[chuckles]
You can complain to my uncle.

696
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,660
He wants to see you.

697
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:25,128
- Your wife good cook?
- Why?

698
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:29,134
It's an old tradition to invite
boss home before prison.

699
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:33,504
You sell two of this
to break your parole.

700
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,972
Rest until Bale Hill.

701
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,541
Yeah, I still gotta figure out
a way outta here.

702
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,143
Figure it out fast, Piotr.

703
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,746
Detective sniffing around
Little Poland.

704
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:43,949
Monday you need to be inside.

705
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:48,452
Kalash told me you went out
last night, motherfucker.

706
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,521
Where did you go?

707
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:50,955
It's none
of your fuckin' business.

708
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:53,525
Come on, I want to know.
Where did you go?

709
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:57,229
My wife's next door.

710
00:40:58,096 --> 00:40:59,798
You have <i>kurba?</i>

711
00:40:59,864 --> 00:41:01,399
[chuckles]

712
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,534
She good fun?

713
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:06,137
Huh? Who is she?

714
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:09,508
Come on, tell me,
you mind if I bonk her a while

715
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:12,010
when you're inside?

716
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:13,912
You touch any of my things
when I'm inside

717
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:16,614
and I'll carve
your fuckin' eyes out.

718
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:23,121
[dramatic music]

719
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:29,061
[door opens and shuts]

720
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:35,834
When?

721
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,269
Tomorrow? In a month?

722
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:40,237
When?

723
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:41,906
Two days.

724
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:48,480
[sniffles] If you go back
inside, you'll never get out.

725
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:53,952
You know that, do you?

726
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:56,554
[intense music]

727
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:01,559
[birds squawking]

728
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:06,931
Are you happy
to spend the day with daddy?

729
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:08,266
Uh-hmm.

730
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:11,436
What are you doing?

731
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:13,304
You see that down there?

732
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:15,673
That's where I'll be going
on my business trip.

733
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,275
But I don't want you to go.

734
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,977
I know, sweetie, but what if I
told you this was the last time.

735
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:21,413
[phone beeps]

736
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:25,082
Okay. Gotta go.

737
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,287
[dramatic music]

738
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:39,063
[exhales]

739
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:47,538
(Wilcox) <i>New warden's
name is James Leonard.</i>

740
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,941
He's been briefed.

741
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:51,142
You give him the list,
he'll put you in solitary

742
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,310
and then in 24 hours
the appellate court judge will

743
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:54,612
put you back on the streets.

744
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,914
Daddy, you're too loud.
I can't hear my movie.

745
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:58,682
Uh, I know.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

746
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,552
Yeah, j-just watch your movie.

747
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:07,425
Sofia and Anna will be
in a FBI safe house

748
00:43:07,492 --> 00:43:10,061
before Klimek evens knows
what happened.

749
00:43:10,128 --> 00:43:12,896
You have my absolute word
on that.

750
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:16,434
Uh, look, um,
I'm gonna need three favors.

751
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,739
First, I'll need a major drug
sweep day after I get there

752
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:23,641
to dry up the competition.

753
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:28,113
And second,
have, uh, Warden Leonard..

754
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:31,548
...put me on program
post detail.

755
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:35,554
And third, in six days..

756
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,221
...courier these beautiful
yellow wonders

757
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,557
to a Deputy Superintendent

758
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:41,591
Reseda Johnson
compliments of the bureau

759
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:43,260
so the prison receives
them on Founders' Day.

760
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:45,163
And, there's got to be a
government seal on the package...

761
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,266
I can't do this, Pete.

762
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,401
You know, if the prosecutor
finds out that I helped

763
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:53,771
people get high, he'll destroy
me, you, and the case.

764
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,206
You..

765
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,909
You gotta fuckin'
help me out here.

766
00:43:58,976 --> 00:44:00,612
I can't do it.

767
00:44:00,677 --> 00:44:03,581
It won't come through, if
it don't come from you guys.

768
00:44:18,496 --> 00:44:19,664
Hmm.

769
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,469
Have Leonard assign me
to roof and yard maintenance.

770
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:28,472
That I'll do,
the drug sweep I'll also do

771
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,173
but the rest you're on your own.

772
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,378
[siren wailing in a distance]

773
00:44:34,811 --> 00:44:36,212
How's Sofia holdin' up?

774
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,149
Just fuckin' great.

775
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:40,551
[phone vibrating]

776
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:44,856
- I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

777
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:46,791
One second, boss.

778
00:44:48,193 --> 00:44:49,828
I gotta go.

779
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:54,466
You'll be fine.

780
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:00,771
[car engine starting]

781
00:45:02,606 --> 00:45:05,744

[speaking in foreign language]

786
00:45:26,998 --> 00:45:30,434
Pete, you should have told me
we have friends coming tonight.

787
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,668
They brought me so many presents

788
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,237
to keep me comfortable
when you're away.

789
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:35,407
You have such an adorable
wife, Piotr.

790
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:38,076
- Beata. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

791
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:39,943
(Klimek) 'We should get
this little creature in bed'

792
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:44,382
then we can celebrate.
Let's go. I will help.

793
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:47,184
- It's okay, I got it.
- No, no, no, no. Please.

794
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:49,320
Piotr, I insist.

795
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:52,290
'After you.'

796
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,875
I don't have kids, Pete.
I regret it.

797
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,744
Must be wonderful.

798
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:15,212
It is.

799
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:19,284
Beata wants them,
but I'm afraid..

800
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,621
I would suffer too much
if something happened to them.

801
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:26,625
Imagine someone hurts them.

802
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:33,731
In the honor of bravery of
Pete's, his courageous wife

803
00:46:33,797 --> 00:46:38,535
here is a Polish song entitled
"I Used To Be A Rose"

804
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:43,273
which talks about the love
we give to our partners.

805
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,942
- <i>Na Zdrowie.</i>
- <i>Na Zdrowie.</i>

806

813
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:45,970
Yeah.
You need more reason to dig?

814
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:48,972
The General just left
the Koslow residence.

815
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,375
(Sofia) Honey,
you want to go to the zoo or not?

816
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:53,244
Let's go to the zoo, come on.

817
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:54,546
'We'll be back
in a couple of hours.'

818
00:47:54,612 --> 00:47:57,447
- Okay.
- Be a good girl, okay?

819
00:47:57,514 --> 00:47:58,815
(Pete) You know daddy
loves you very much.

820
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:01,651
(Anna)
I know. Can I go now?

821
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:04,155
- 'Anna, come on!'
- Pete?

822
00:48:04,222 --> 00:48:06,290
Pete, come on.

823
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:07,659
Give me a kiss, eh?

824
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:09,527
- Mwah!
- See you later, guys.

825
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:12,395
- Bye! Have fun.
- Bye! Love you!

826
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:15,166

831
00:48:37,954 --> 00:48:39,590
Those kids with a drone.

832
00:48:39,657 --> 00:48:40,990
Better call them today.

833
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:44,028
Pete, don't worry.
I don't want you to worry.

834
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:46,864
- I'll take care of it.
- You still got the key?

835
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:49,733
It's right here.

836
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,771

Please, I need help.
My husband's going crazy!

840
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:19,396
He wants to kill me.
Please send someone fast!

841
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:21,399
(woman on phone)
'Just hold it right now, ma'am.'

842

'Ma'am, is he armed?'

843
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:25,068
'Do you have any children
in the house?'

844
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:27,371
Please send someone fast.

Second time around, huh?

853
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:34,438
I want you to stand
right there for me.

854
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:42,813
Oh, what language is that?

855
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,416
I don't know.
I was drunk when I did it.

856
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,317
Maybe Chinese or something.

857
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:49,487
You're not gonna tell me, huh?

858
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,557
'Okay, now show me your arms.'

859

- Are you affiliated?
- He is.

Last term you become a courier
on behalf of the Poles.

861

Look at you. They gave you
the white shirts, Slewitt.

862
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:05,869
- His bed been assigned?
- Not yet.

863
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:07,371
I got this.

864
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:08,838
Welcome back, Koslow.

865
00:51:08,905 --> 00:51:11,576

- What up, Slewitt?
- Smiley, this is Koslow.

882
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:28,117
Your new celley.
Try to make him feel at home.

883
00:52:28,184 --> 00:52:30,121
[indistinct chatter]

884
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:35,159
Hey, don't be scared.
They'll be gentle.

885
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:36,861
Won't you, boys?

886
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:44,334
The Prodigal Son returns.

887
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,136
I need two extra mats.

888
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:49,307
You and you, roll it up.

889
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:52,009
It's your lucky day, dickheads..

890
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:54,811
[speaking in foreign language]

891
00:53:01,184 --> 00:53:03,420
Each and every business that
takes places under the roof

892
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,889
of this facility
runs through me.

893
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:09,326
Comply or I crucify you.

894
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:14,164
- Get back to your block.
- Yes, sir.

895
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:17,168
[indistinct chatter]

896
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,275
[speaking in foreign language]

897
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:28,880
[dog panting]

898
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:31,182
(male #4)
'Rise and shine, ladies!'

899
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:34,184
[clamoring]

900
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:45,496
It's time to get the fuck off.

901
00:53:45,563 --> 00:53:47,231
Name?

902
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:49,032
Koslow, Pete.

903
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:54,938
Previous term
you kept yourself busy, huh?

904
00:53:55,005 --> 00:53:57,708
Roofing, HVAC maintenance?

905
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:59,675
We should get you
on the program, Mr. Koslow.

906
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:01,846
I appreciate that, warden.

907
00:54:03,047 --> 00:54:04,115
Name?

908
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:07,550
That guy.

909
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:10,853
- This guy.
- Hands up. Legs spread.

910
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,755
- 'Next. Hey.'
- 'You.'

911
00:54:12,822 --> 00:54:15,025
[indistinct chatter]

912
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:16,794
(male #5)
'This dumb fuck.'

913
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,898
[indistinct chatter]

914
00:54:27,237 --> 00:54:30,740
They swept the whole place..
Bone-dry.

915
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:32,541
That's a lucky break for us.

916
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:34,378
Product will be here soon.

917
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:39,050
[speaking in foreign language]

918
00:54:49,226 --> 00:54:51,028
Under the table.

919
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,066
[dramatic music]

920
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:03,007
[indistinct chatter]

921
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:15,885
[phone beeps]

922
00:55:15,952 --> 00:55:18,690
[indistinct chatter]

923
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:31,568
- Who?
- K-O-S-L-O-W.

924
00:55:31,635 --> 00:55:33,237
Comma Peter.

925
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:35,905
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Uh, don't apologize.

926
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:37,808
Me, I'm old-school,
I knock on doors

927
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,844
get-right-there-in-your-face
type of cop.

928
00:55:39,909 --> 00:55:42,278
Wilcox, we gotta go.

929
00:55:42,346 --> 00:55:43,780
Sorry. You are?

930
00:55:43,847 --> 00:55:47,016
Detective Edward Grens
from the NYPD.

931
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:49,152
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

932
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:50,687
We're just having a conversation

933
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:53,858
about somebody named
Peter Koslow.

934
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:55,492
'Decorated vet.'

935
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:58,528
Driver slash security
for the Polish Consulate.

936
00:55:58,594 --> 00:56:01,831
Fast-tracked almost smells
like a bogus parole violation.

937
00:56:01,898 --> 00:56:03,367
Back into Bale Hill.

938
00:56:03,432 --> 00:56:05,534
Same prison he was serving
20 years for murder

939
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:08,204
before somebody pulled him out
pending the investigation

940
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:10,007
of new evidence.

941
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:12,576
Anyway, I want to know
why your subordinate's name

942
00:56:12,643 --> 00:56:15,411
keeps popping up around
this admittedly suspicious

943
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:17,380
motherfuckin' file.

944
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:22,820
I'm sure that, uh,
Agent Wilcox's name pops up

945
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,688
on a number of case files,
detective.

946
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:26,023
You should check with the DEA.

947
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,225
They just sent me here.

948
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:31,394
(Wilcox) 'Look, if I was involved
in the kind of pro-active operation'

949
00:56:31,461 --> 00:56:34,030
that you are suggesting,
I would be intimately acquainted

950
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:37,835
with, uh, Peter,
what was his name again?

951
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,536
Koslow.

952
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,106
- Koslow.
- Hmm.

953
00:56:42,172 --> 00:56:45,976
Our organizations may not
see eye-to-eye, detective

954
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:50,448
but we've extended you every
professional courtesy we can.

955
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:04,027
There's Koslow
right after Gomez was killed.

956
00:57:06,096 --> 00:57:08,931
That Prius screamin',
"We're the FBI!"

957
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:11,634
'That's y'all leaving
the scene.'

958
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:15,072
And here, even though this
picture may be hard to read

959
00:57:15,137 --> 00:57:19,442
that person looks very much
like you, Agent Wilcox..

960
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,246
...drivin' away
from the crime scene.

961
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:25,682
You want to pitch
your field office

962
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:29,085
against the biggest police
department in the world?

963
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:31,254
Let's do it.

964
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,224
We love us a good fight.

965
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:36,226
[intense music]

966
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:40,097
Have a good day.

967
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,047
[music continues]

968
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:07,091
[thunder rumbling]

969
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,336
[music continues]

970
00:58:21,038 --> 00:58:24,175
[rain pattering]

971
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:29,880
[sniffles]

972
00:58:32,048 --> 00:58:37,320
What perfume you wear?
Smells expensive.

973
00:58:37,387 --> 00:58:39,923
[chuckles]

974
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:42,360
[sighs]

975
00:58:47,097 --> 00:58:50,233
[drone whirring]

976
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:53,503
[seagulls squawking]

977
00:58:55,237 --> 00:58:57,974
Alright. Now, get
this shit cleaned up.

978
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:01,177
[dramatic music]

979
00:59:13,222 --> 00:59:15,692
[indistinct chatter]

980
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:38,982
(male #6)
'Okay, that's enough.'

981
00:59:53,597 --> 00:59:55,833
(Grens)
'It must be tough on you.'

982
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,170
- We'll get through it.
- 'Like you did the last time?'

983
01:00:00,237 --> 01:00:02,405
I checked the old visitor logs
at Bale Hill.

984
01:00:02,472 --> 01:00:05,409
You and Anna never missed
a visitors' day.

985
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,945
That's how
you kept him strong, huh?

986
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:10,047
You let him see
how much he had to lose.

987
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:12,983
[sighs]
What do you want?

988
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:16,086
Someone killed a friend of mine.

989
01:00:16,152 --> 01:00:18,053
I used to think
your husband did it

990
01:00:18,121 --> 01:00:19,389
but now I'm not so sure.

991
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:21,992
This FBI thing has gotten me
thinkin' otherwise.

992
01:00:22,057 --> 01:00:24,226
[chuckles]

993
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:27,129
Look, I'm here
to help your husband.

994
01:00:27,197 --> 01:00:30,166
But you got to give me
something to work with.

995
01:00:30,233 --> 01:00:32,335
You know, five years ago
we walked into a bar

996
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:35,505
looking for a jump start
for our car.

997
01:00:35,572 --> 01:00:38,274
Some bikers inside started
making comments about me

998
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,277
so Pete asked them to stop

999
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:43,481
and then he was fighting
three of them.

1000
01:00:45,014 --> 01:00:46,382
That night

1001
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:49,118
I went from being the wife
of a great father

1002
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:53,090
and a loving husband
to the wife of a convict killer.

1003
01:00:53,157 --> 01:00:56,494
And since then,
every time someone tells us

1004
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,161
they wanna help

1005
01:00:58,228 --> 01:01:00,697
they end up doing
the exact opposite.

1006
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,369
So unless you wanna
buy something..

1007
01:01:05,436 --> 01:01:09,139
With all due respect
to you and the NYPD

1008
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:11,642
get the fuck out of my store.

1009
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:17,581
I'm not like all the others,
Mrs. Koslow.

1010
01:01:19,282 --> 01:01:22,119
I hope you don't learn that
the hard way.

1011
01:01:28,324 --> 01:01:30,493
Stay safe out here.

1012
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,367
[indistinct chatter]

1013
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:40,237
[intense music]

1014
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,742
And here we go.

1015
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:51,014
[indistinct chatter]

1016
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:54,218
[music continues]

1017
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:03,227
[indistinct chatter]

1018
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:30,753
[cheering]

1019
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:49,572
Let him through.

1020
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:57,079
(Grens on phone) 'The Knicks
hardly get that exciting, huh?'

1021
01:02:57,146 --> 01:02:58,614
Who's this?

1022
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:01,618
Motherfucker, I'm the hangman.

1023
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:04,355
And I just put a tight noose
around your neck.

1024
01:03:05,688 --> 01:03:09,559
In a few hours, you're gonna be
alone on this yard

1025
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:13,396
it'll be the scariest moment
of your life.

1026
01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:16,432
'Your only way out
is that man in front of you.'

1027
01:03:16,498 --> 01:03:19,101
'His name is Vermin.'

1028
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:22,271
'When you're ready to talk
about Officer Gomez's murder'

1029
01:03:22,338 --> 01:03:24,641
'tell Vermin
to call the hangman.'

1030
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:27,644
[intense music]

1031
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,737
[indistinct chatter]

1032
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,556
[ominous music]

1033
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:17,660
Here I am, dead man.

1034
01:04:17,726 --> 01:04:19,829
Present and fucking
accounted for.

1035
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:22,032
We need to talk.

1036
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,567
I got a fuckin' present for you.

1037
01:04:23,632 --> 01:04:25,768
Why're you selling fuckin'
product on my patch.

1038
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,706
To get your attention.

1039
01:04:30,139 --> 01:04:33,542
You have it. I don't think
it's on you want.

1040
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,345
Slewitt.

1041
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:37,547
That's for not respecting
the system.

1042
01:04:38,648 --> 01:04:41,085
That's for not following
our rules.

1043
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,288
[grunting]

1044
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:49,492
Smiley, listen,
listen, listen.

1045
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:50,726
Please, listen!
You gotta listen to me.

1046
01:04:50,793 --> 01:04:52,161
I'm here to take out
The General.

1047
01:04:52,228 --> 01:04:53,663
I'm here
to take out The General.

1048
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,865
I need, I need his Bale Hill
distribution chain.

1049
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:57,667
I need all the names.
I need all the names.

1050
01:04:57,735 --> 01:05:00,704
I'll take him down.
I'll fucking help you..

1051
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:06,309
Make it look like a suicide.

1052
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:08,178
Clean up after you're done.

1053
01:05:08,244 --> 01:05:11,382
[choking]

1054
01:05:19,155 --> 01:05:21,458
You think Mick is important?

1055
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:25,128
Six Ki's of fentanyl per week.

1056
01:05:25,195 --> 01:05:28,030

1057
01:05:28,097 --> 01:05:30,034
What are those names for?

1058
01:05:33,336 --> 01:05:35,972
[Peter gagging]

1059
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:37,975
What are those names for?

1060
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:53,923
I'm a... snitch.

1061
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:56,860
I'm a snitch.

1062
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,668
Let him down.

1063
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:09,672
[gasps]

1064
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:11,675
[coughs]

1065
01:06:13,576 --> 01:06:15,378
It's their fault, Ben.

1066

1069
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:29,291
Are you alright, dead man?

1070
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,061
You're a snitch?

1071
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:35,531
I made a deal with the Feds
to take down The General.

1072
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:40,871
Look, you're on top now.

1073
01:06:40,938 --> 01:06:43,673
But The General's coming for you
harder than ever.

1074
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,278
If you gimme that list

1075
01:06:48,344 --> 01:06:50,646
I'll bury
that Polish cocksucker.

1076
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:55,552
That's all, huh?

1077
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:05,762
So, what's it gonna be?

1078
01:07:09,432 --> 01:07:11,735
If you're alive in three hours..

1079
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,838
...you fuckin' own my ass.

1082
01:07:41,998 --> 01:07:43,933
You can wait here.

1083
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:01,751
Grens went to Bale Hill.

1084
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:03,552
Shit.

1085
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:05,121
- I'm sure Leonard blocked him.
- He did.

1086
01:08:05,188 --> 01:08:07,990
But it's only a matter of time
before he gets to Koslow.

1087
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:10,693
He's already got Washington
on the fucking phone

1088
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,663
asking me why an NYPD cop
is trying to subpoena a file

1089
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,199
on an FBI informant
who shouldn't exist.

1090
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,801
Look, we just need
to stall a few days.

1091
01:08:19,868 --> 01:08:22,872
Koslow is so close to delivering
and then it won't matter.

1092
01:08:25,207 --> 01:08:27,543
What? What are you thinking?

1093
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:31,181
- Burn him.
- No.

1094
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:33,782
He has a family, I mean,
we, you can't make this call.

1095
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,752
The Bureau can't afford
the luxury

1096
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:38,254
of your precious feelings
right now.

1097
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,756
We looked him in the eyes.
We made him guarantees.

1098
01:08:40,823 --> 01:08:43,092
You took a convicted killer
out of prison

1099
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:45,061
you run him off the books
and you stuck him in a room

1100
01:08:45,127 --> 01:08:46,362
where a cop was murdered.

1101
01:08:46,429 --> 01:08:47,564
If you don't see how this is

1102
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,132
about to blow the fuck up

1103
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,933
and tear you apart with it..

1104
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,470
...you're not the agent
I thought you were.

1105
01:08:53,536 --> 01:08:56,239
How fucking dare you?

1106
01:08:56,305 --> 01:08:58,674
I was operating
under your authority.

1107
01:08:58,742 --> 01:09:00,644
You will not throw me
under the fucking bus

1108
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:02,011
if I don't burn an innocent man.

1109
01:09:02,078 --> 01:09:05,015
I don't have to throw you
under the bus.

1110
01:09:05,082 --> 01:09:08,018
I didn't know anything
about this operation.

1111
01:09:10,485 --> 01:09:12,255
You were trying
to impress a superior

1112
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:13,957
and you went too far.

1113
01:09:15,457 --> 01:09:17,094
We'll make an example of you.

1114
01:09:18,895 --> 01:09:21,965
You will serve jail-time.
I guarantee it.

1115
01:09:32,007 --> 01:09:34,810
You know, I started
on this floor 23 years ago.

1116
01:09:34,877 --> 01:09:37,179
My desk was right there.

1117
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,286
Burn him.

1118
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:45,154
It's an order.

1119
01:09:54,663 --> 01:09:57,800

I had you, white boy.

1123
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:31,667
Smiley Phelps
was right behind you.

1124
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:34,071
Like a nigger angel.

1126
01:10:41,143 --> 01:10:42,244

Hey, warden?
I just wanna shake your hand.

1131
01:11:25,956 --> 01:11:27,222
Come on, leave the warden alone.

1132
01:11:27,289 --> 01:11:28,692
Oh, no, it's okay.

1133
01:11:30,092 --> 01:11:31,927
I just wanna thank you
and congratulate you

1134
01:11:31,994 --> 01:11:34,329
for running this place
the right way.

1135
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:36,033
I now request a solitary.

1136
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,670
I can't do that, Pete.

1137
01:11:41,203 --> 01:11:43,005
If you leave me out here,
I'm a fuckin' dead man.

1138
01:11:43,073 --> 01:11:45,742
I'm sorry, Pete,
they were very clear.

1139
01:11:45,809 --> 01:11:47,711
Who was clear?
Look, this wasn't the deal.

1140
01:11:47,777 --> 01:11:49,311
Just get Wilcox here right now.

1141
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:50,913
Escort the inmate back
to his block.

1142
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,817
- Yes, sir.
- Lenon, Lenon? Come back here.

1143

Come on, guys.
Get off the phones.

1148
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,804
Next in line. Six minutes.

1150
01:12:24,847 --> 01:12:27,317
- Wilcox.
- It's me.

1151

Hey, it's me.

1152
01:12:32,087 --> 01:12:35,157
I did it.
I drew you the picture.

1153
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:38,495
(Pete) 'Why aren't
you sayin' anything?'

1154
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:42,831
I did what you told me,
and I drew the picture

1155
01:12:42,899 --> 01:12:44,735
and now I need
to show it to you.

1156
01:12:46,036 --> 01:12:48,171
'I need to show it
to you right now.'

1157
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:56,345
You promised you'd come see it.
You fuckin' promised.

Pete?

1169
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:57,974
Are you okay?

1170
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,512
The key, you gotta use it
right now.

1171
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:08,150
Why?

1172
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:11,822
They fucked me.

1173
01:14:13,655 --> 01:14:16,591
- I'm not gettin' out of this.
- 'No, no. You shut up.'

1174
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:18,027
'You listen to me.'

1175
01:14:18,094 --> 01:14:21,230
There is a detective.
He, he asked about the dead cop.

1176
01:14:21,296 --> 01:14:24,067
He knows about the FBI, okay?

1177
01:14:24,134 --> 01:14:27,302
'You don't fucking give up now.'

1178
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:30,172
Okay. Alright.
Give him the tapes.

1179
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,274
Tell him there's information
about Daniel Gomez.

1180
01:14:32,341 --> 01:14:33,710
He'll know what to do,
but you gotta

1181
01:14:33,775 --> 01:14:36,445
you gotta make him promise
to protect you too.

1182
01:14:36,512 --> 01:14:38,314
'You gotta do it right now.
You and Anna you ain't safe.'

the house right now.'

'Okay, baby. You gotta get
out of the house right now.'

1185
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:44,887
Promise me.
Promise me right now, okay?

1186

We tracked you here.

1198

Now, you and Anna
need to get off the grid.

1199

You need to go somewhere
the Pols won't find you.

1200
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:08,396
