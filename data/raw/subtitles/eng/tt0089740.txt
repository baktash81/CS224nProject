1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:22,199
ORION'S BELT

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,035
-Hey, look at that!
-It's a polar bear, all right.

3
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,639
-Look, it's yellow!
-Looks kind of shabby to me.

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,395
I thought polar bears were white.

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,315
Christ, Sverre!
Not you, too!

6
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,270
-This light's incredible!
-It is the Land of the Midnight Sun.

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,995
Shit!

8
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,754
There it is!

9
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,633
What are you doing?
Give me back my gun!

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,675
Herr Jansen,
we were told to carry guns!

11
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,197
To protect yourself,
but not to hunt!

12
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,634
I am sick of this.

13
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,112
With twice as many,
it might have paid off.

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,558
Twice as many?
Could you stand 20 of those?

15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,393
You got a better idea?

16
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,229
Damn Lars! "I have business ashore."
Doesn't even bother joining us!

17
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,597
Relax, Tom.
Lars can't help it if...

18
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,788
There's something wrong with
the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

19
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,511
I'll fix it!
"I'm rushing off to flush you..."

20
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,918
-Aren't these Russian letters?
-Yes. This is a Russian souvenir.

21
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,472
How come?

22
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,636
Look over there. Barentsburg.
Russian capital of the Arctic.

23
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,352
-You mean there are Russians here?
-More than 3000.

24
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,308
With twice as many men, they produce
the same amount of coal as us.

25
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,836
They're not exactly famous
for their efficiency.

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,117
Most of those miners
have hands as white as yours.

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,713
Spies?

28
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,556
Five helicopters, a heliport,
armored snow trucks...

29
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,511
-I thought Spitsbergen was Norwegian.
-Why does your government allow it?

30
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,037
A mouse
doesn't pick a fight with a bear.

31
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,395
Where's my gun?

32
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,588
-What are you doing?
-Saving bears from people like you.

33
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,949
-I refuse to pay for this trip!
-Then this is where you get off!

34
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,795
It was only a joke!
Put me down!

35
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,311
"It will be so romantic," he says!
Well, I don't need romance, George.

36
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,836
I could have found more comfort
in Alcatraz!

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,678
You wanna go to Alcatraz, I'll
take you to Alcatraz. Believe you me!

38
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,153
-How much did we make this time?
-Not even enough for fuel.

39
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,359
Chicken feed!

40
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,869
Don't you have
anything worthwhile for us?

41
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,115
Or do we have to keep up these
"guided tours with polar experts"?

42
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,230
Remember those guys who were
test drilling by Sarstangen?

43
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,473
They didn't find any oil,
and gave up.

44
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,509
Now the supply company
wants its bulldozer returned.

45
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,591
A freight job?

46
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,389
No.
Not quite.

47
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,952
They want the bulldozer picked up,
but they don't want it back.

48
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,073
They want us to "lose" it on the
way back to the mainland. Insurance!

49
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,470
Dumping a bulldozer...
Isn't that illegal?

50
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,793
-Unless the pay's good...
-The money is OK.

51
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,476
But how about getting paid twice
for the same job?

52
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,276
Sit down.
I'll get you a beer.

53
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,632
The northern cap is full
of American and Russian bases.

54
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,273
There are subs up here with rockets
that can reach Moscow and New York.

55
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,470
Obviously everyone would love
to have control over Svalbard!

56
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,555
We're here to make sure
the Treaty is complied with.

57
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,435
Mind if I take a sip?

58
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,149
That no one violates
any rules or regulations...

59
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,589
That Treaty is over 60 years old.
Times change. We're NATO members now!

60
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,118
-Norway is no threat to anyone.
-NATO is, and we're a part of that.

61
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,193
So what do we do?
Tell the Russians to go to hell?

62
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,275
You can't belong to NATO
and let the Russians stay.

63
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,709
You can't play on both teams,
or you'll end up being the ball.

64
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,077
What's your opinion, Tom?

65
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,110
Pump too much air into the ball,
and it will burst.

66
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,314
Did I say something wrong?

67
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,634
-It's all a joke to you, isn't it?
-The discussion? Yes.

68
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,872
The two of us?
No.

69
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,355
"Someone has to say: I want
your child, to make life bearable."

70
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,277
-A poem I once read.
-Shit...

71
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,753
You really are handsome.

72
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,351
We acquire
sophisticated habits up here.

73
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,839
-Stop running all the time, Tommy.
-We're OK together, aren't we?

74
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,753
You're like a frog in a well.

75
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,789
You see a spot of blue
and think that's the whole sky.

76
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,829
-Was that Ibsen or Chairman Mao?
-Chairman Mao, I think.

77
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,231
Have you seen the pictures
of my kids? Let me show you.

78
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,276
There. Look at this.
They're the cutest kids you'll...

79
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,352
Come on, Lars.
Now's not the time!

80
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,270
There's room for more here.

81
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,632
Governor Backe sends his greetings!

82
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,158
Backe wants to see us.

83
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,196
-All three of us?
-Nope.

84
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,229
I'm going to the airport,
Sverre's shopping. You have to go.

85
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,757
-Why always me?
-He likes you.

86
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,630
-Care to tell me what's going on?
-Remember what we talked about?

87
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,159
About getting paid twice?

88
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,359
-Get to the point!
-Dammit, Tommy!

89
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,159
I found a buyer for the bulldozer.

90
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,789
The company gets rid of it,
this guy gets it. Everyone's happy.

91
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,430
Until they meet.
It's a small island.

92
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,230
Not a chance, Tommy.
We'll sell it in Greenland.

93
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,829
Look!

94
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,828
We pick it up here.
Then we head south for Tromsø.

95
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,028
But from Bellsund we head west
toward Greenland instead!

96
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,114
Consul Ivanov.
Our Minister of Justice.

97
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,068
Hello.
Welcome.

98
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,670
The Minister's secretary.

99
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,915
Not official.

100
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,792
Get them something to drink.
I'll be there in five minutes.

101
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,790
Hang on.

102
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,993
Would you mind telling me
what you're up to?

103
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,280
Not at all.
Sorry the others couldn't make it.

104
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,310
-We have so much to do.
-You think you're smart, don't you?

105
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,508
Undercutting honest operators.
Stealing whatever you can.

106
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,232
Ignoring laws and regulations.
Think you're above it all.

107
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,474
That ends now. From now on
I want to know every move you make.

108
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,839
And one more thing:
Stop playing pirates!

109
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,871
Actually,
we consider ourselves junk dealers.

110
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,548
Anyway, this is just a little
freight job to the mainland.

111
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,029
"Upernarissuaq".

112
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,118
Eskimo. It means
"a good place to live in the spring".

113
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,719
Three and a half tons?!

114
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,112
Three and a half tons
is all that crane can hold.

115
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,115
-Then how do we get it ashore?
-That's your problem.

116
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,239
Delivery means delivery, right?

117
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,079
Yeah, yeah...

118
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,152
It will never work!

119
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,313
Hoist it up, boys!

120
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,710
Hold it there!

121
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,595
Come on!

122
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,877
Dammit!

123
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,072
-A battery.
-Six volt.

124
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,432
Go back to Norway!

125
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,716
Bravo!
Bravo!

126
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,274
I give you one bulldozer,
cash on delivery!

127
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,308
Five out of six!
Not bad, huh?

128
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,879
No!
Do you have to do that?

129
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,998
-I fixed it, Tom!
-You guys are nuts.

130
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,990
<i>...Tromsøflaket to South Cape,</i>
<i>increasing to near or strong gale.</i>

131
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,550
Damn!
We have to radio in!

132
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,750
<i>...20-23 meters per second.</i>
<i>Some rain, moderate to...</i>

133
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:55,159
Sandy Hook calling Isfjord Radio!
Come in!

134
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,676
<i>Sandy Hook, Isfjord Radio.</i>
<i>Come in, Sandy Hook!</i>

135
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,515
We are southwest of Bear Island.

136
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,638
<i>Can't hear you.</i>
<i>Please repeat.</i>

137
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,915
We were carrying a bulldozer.
Almost capsized. Had to dump it.

138
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,991
Please inform governor's office!

139
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,358
<i>-Sandy Hook, please repeat.</i>
-Roger!

140
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,156
<i>-Sandy Hook, try again later.</i>
-Over and out!

141
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,111
Now what do we do?

142
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,230
We can't sail in to Longyearbyen
tomorrow. I suggest a detour.

143
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,157
Look at that bastard!
30 miles, at least!

144
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,315
It's the Coast Guard!

145
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,755
Damn!

146
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,553
So much for our bulldozer scam.

147
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,953
Have you seen that trawler
coming up to port?

148
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,714
Quite a trawler.

149
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,438
Hey, Ivan! Did they forget to tell
you this is a demilitarized zone?

150
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,716
Arrogant bastards!
They don't give a damn.

151
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,995
-What's wrong with the steering?
-That's what I'm trying to find out!

152
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,549
Damn rust bucket!

153
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,669
-We need to get to shore.
-Find a place, then!

154
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,475
Here!
Behind Kippert Island.

155
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,995
-Have you lost your mind?
-It's either there, or nowhere.

156
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,280
Shit! How do you propose
we get her in without steering?

157
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,749
We take her in by hand.

158
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,758
Starboard!
Ten degrees to starboard!

159
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,515
Ten degrees to starboard!

160
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,349
Port!

161
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,193
Ten degrees to port!

162
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,237
Straighten her out!
Steady there!

163
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,077
Port! Over to port!
Ten degrees!

164
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,832
-Haul in!
-Haul in!

165
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,238
-I fixed it with an old rubber boot.
-One of mine? If you...

166
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,599
Fine! Fix it yourself,
and Tom and I can go ashore!

167
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,475
We should teach him to hunt reindeer.

168
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,708
-Paddle, Mr. Fix-it-all!
-Yeah, yeah...

169
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,149
Did you hear about these guys who
found the first arctic sea gull eggs?

170
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,236
They were starving, and so
they made a huge omelet out of them.

171
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:32,598
Then, back in Tromsø, they heard that
British Museum paid 100 per egg.

172
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,431
Imagine that!
Thousands of pounds up in omelet!

173
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,436
-Did they give the cook a beating?
-Have I told that story before?

174
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,195
Hold it right there!

175
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,155
<i>Perfetto!</i>

176
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,949
Where did our photographer go?

177
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,190
Damn!

178
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,830
Is that copper?

179
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,830
Six to seven kilos per meter!

180
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,436
Ten to twelve kroner per kilo!

181
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,790
Look at this!

182
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,429
-What is that?
-I have no idea.

183
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,435
Maybe some kind of listening station.

184
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,511
American?
Russian?

185
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,038
Nothing is labeled.

186
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,635
Oh shit... !

187
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,198
A Norwegian!

188
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,272
Armed Norwegians!

189
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,273
Stop, or I'll shoot!

190
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,599
Get me down, dammit!

191
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,556
Holy shit!

192
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,078
Take his machine gun!

193
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,919
-I don't want to!
-Take it, dammit!

194
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,153
No, no, no, boys!
Take it easy! Don't shoot!

195
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,630
Shoot!
Shoot!

196
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,476
It's all a big misunderstanding!

197
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,879
Igor is wounded!
He needs help!

198
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,319
I sure messed things up for us.

199
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,789
It wasn't your fault.

200
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,840
That was insane.

201
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,871
-Are you OK?
-Swell.

202
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,672
The Eskimos have 40 words for kayak
and maybe 20 for snow.

203
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,997
But not one for war.

204
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,030
If there's a life after death,
maybe we should live like Eskimos.

205
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,308
Listen, Sverre.
You're the expert.

206
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,235
The helicopter base is what,
300-350 miles away?

207
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,599
-And their cruising speed is...?
-200.

208
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,791
So in a couple of hours
we'll know if we can expect company.

209
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,916
It's no use.
They've blocked the frequency.

210
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,989
Dammit, Tommy!

211
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,239
We saw something we shouldn't have,
and killed a Soviet citizen!

212
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,870
They expect us to take
the shortest route to Longyearbyen.

213
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,354
If we go east of Barents Island,
we can hide among the trawlers.

214
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,555
I'll go make some coffee.

215
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,078
The weather report called for fog.
Let's hope they're right.

216
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,117
Either we've lost them,
or they're not coming.

217
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,398
I hope you're right.
Help me up. I can steer.

218
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,156
-No, you take it easy.
-I can do it.

219
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,150
Everything OK?

220
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,671
Where's that goddamn fog?

221
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,275
It sure isn't here!

222
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,155
<i>...but since we're on</i>
<i>the subject of summer, -</i>

223
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,555
<i>- we'd like to send out a greeting</i>
<i>to Bjørn in Hareid, -</i>

224
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,749
<i>- and everyone else</i>
<i>who may be "on the road".</i>

225
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,830
-Isn't that sweet!
-Quiet!

226
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,556
Switch off the lights!

227
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,997
Maybe they'll drop a sack of rubles -

228
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,993
- and a postcard
asking us to forget everything.

229
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,917
Your stupid jokes have gotten us
into enough trouble! Shut up!

230
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,710
The fog is lifting.

231
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,873
Keep as close to shore as possible.
Don't make it any easier for them.

232
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,795
Get her in to shore!

233
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,596
Like a frog in a well...

234
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,679
-We're finished, Tommy!
-Like hell!

235
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,114
You're insane!

236
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,310
You're utterly insane.

237
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,430
Sverre!

238
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,157
Mayday, Mayday...

239
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,278
Mayday, Mayday!
Sandy Hook calling all ships!

240
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,313
Sandy Hook calling all ships.

241
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,989
One man hurt. In serious condition.
In need of immediate assistance.

242
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,916
Position:
78 degrees, 22 minutes north.

243
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,914
20 degrees, 40 minutes east.

244
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,517
Repeat: We are in need
of immediate assistance!

245
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,195
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!

246
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,278
-It's no use!
-We need fresh water for Sverre.

247
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,396
I'll fix the engine.

248
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,520
Where are we now?

249
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,868
By Cape Dufferin.

250
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,474
The boat...

251
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,112
-The boat went to hell.
-Yes, I know.

252
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,590
We should have insured her.

253
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,876
Shit!

254
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,030
Skipper...

255
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,435
No!

256
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,675
Skipper...

257
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,036
Skipper!

258
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,069
Skipper!
Skipper!

259
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,273
Who is that?

260
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,116
The man you transported that
bulldozer for, the one you "dumped".

261
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:34,196
But that now, strangely enough,
is at Morken Bros. in Greenland.

262
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,837
Sandy Hook was sunk by Russians.
Lars and Sverre are dead.

263
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,357
No more wild stories now, Jansen.
I want facts.

264
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:51,595
Then listen! I'm telling you the
Russians have killed Lars and Sverre.

265
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,116
Our boat was sunk off Cape Dufferin.

266
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,748
Why would the Russians do that?

267
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,597
We came across a transmitter on
Kippert Island. There was shooting.

268
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,471
Can you prove any of this?

269
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,514
The gun!
I had the Russian gun!

270
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,118
You had nothing
but dust in your pockets, Jansen.

271
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,996
Fine.
That man hired us -

272
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,950
- to dump the bulldozer
so he could collect insurance...

273
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,635
That's a lie!
We never made such an agreement.

274
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,031
The bulldozer
was to be delivered in Tromsø.

275
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,239
This Lars
must have scammed his partners.

276
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,231
Enough!

277
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,075
Tom!
Tommy!

278
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,429
-What's happened?
-Tom's being taken to Oslo.

279
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,912
-Why?
-Insurance fraud. Stole a bulldozer.

280
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,797
We have studied Backe's report.
It was quite interesting.

281
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,758
Yes, it's all there.

282
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:00,119
The bulldozer doesn't interest us.
That's a police matter.

283
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:06,276
Our job is to find out
whether your other story is true.

284
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,559
Have you told this story
to anyone but Backe?

285
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,438
No.

286
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,750
Are you sure?

287
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,189
Of course.

288
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:06,795
-Have you found anything out?
-No. It's just a routine question.

289
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,518
He must have said something?

290
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,150
Nothing coherent.
He seemed drunk.

291
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,480
You know those guys,
what they're capable of.

292
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,555
-What happened to him?
-I don't believe insurance fraud.

293
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,077
-Where are the other two?
-Who knows? Backe questioned him.

294
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,951
-Maybe they fought over the profits.
-You don't believe that!

295
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,038
We want you to look at
a number of photos and drawings -

296
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,398
- of various types
of Russian listening stations.

297
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,554
Take your time, and if you see one
that looks like the one you saw, -

298
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,951
- you tell us, OK?
-Ok.

299
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:04,070
That's it! It wasn't completely
assembled, but that's the one.

300
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,796
-Are you 100 % certain?
-Yes, sir.

301
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,030
Good.

302
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,475
Thank you very much.

303
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,551
Eva!

304
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,914
It's Russian, Eva.

305
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:49,914
I want you to tell me where Tom is,
what's happening to him, and why!

306
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,595
And what happened to Lars,
Sverre and Sandy Hook?

307
01:12:53,760 --> 01:13:00,996
Answer me, or I'll make sure people
start asking uncomfortable questions!

308
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,711
I can't say a word.
It's a matter of security.

309
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,474
His or yours?

310
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,918
-Let me in on it.
-We can't tell you everything.

311
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:17,119
This part
of the polar region is vital.

312
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,593
Hinlopen, between West Spitsbergen
and Nordaustlandet, -

313
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:29,029
- and the waters between
Nordaustlandet and Kvitøya -

314
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:35,355
- have been code-named Orion's Belt.
We like our mythology here.

315
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,308
-You've OK'd the surveillance?
-As long as we know about it.

316
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:45,555
-Two of my friends were killed!
-Those were your words.

317
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,789
A Russian citizen was also killed.

318
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,074
By whom?

319
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,393
-The Russians fired first!
-Can you prove that?

320
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,032
-Good evening, Mr. Ambassador.
-Minister.

321
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:48,589
On the one hand, we have the word
of a man with a bad reputation.

322
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,395
On the other hand,
a very delicate balance -

323
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,189
- neither of us
would like to see disturbed.

324
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,156
Put this one rotten apple
on the scales, -

325
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:06,519
- and that balance
would be completely disturbed.

326
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,954
We have to ask ourselves: Are we
prepared to see the consequences?

327
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,996
Would you jump off a thing like that?

328
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,874
Perhaps I could be persuaded.
I doubt if I could be pushed.

329
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:32,194
-What will happen to the man?
-He'll be looked after.

330
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:38,394
I've seen too much.
I know too much.

331
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,319
Something like that.

332
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:49,312
You're signed on to a vessel
heading to the West Indies tomorrow.

333
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,597
I don't have any papers.
I'm blacklisted.

334
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,958
You're not going as Tom Jansen.
He ceases to exist.

335
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,717
You aren't getting off that easy!
I'll go to the papers and...

336
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,351
That would be stupid.
No one will print your story.

337
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,354
There is something
called national security.

338
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,993
If your story leaks out, we may have
to kick the Russians off Svalbard.

339
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,153
The balance would be upset.
No one wants that.

340
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,676
The danger of war would be imminent.

341
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:32,279
This is a game of chess, and you
aren't even on the board. Sorry.

342
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:43,999
Talk to anyone about this, and
you put their lives in danger, too.

343
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,718
We'll take you to the boat tonight.

344
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,476
Have a light?

345
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,669
No, listen to me.

346
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:35,509
Get on a plane tonight.
We'll meet in Oslo tomorrow.

347
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:42,679
That's all I can say now. Meet me
at the Theater Café tomorrow at 7 pm.

348
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,190
OK?

349
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,036
Great!

350
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,953
Eva?
I love you.

351
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:10,435
I see.
On her way to Oslo.

352
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,351
Fine, we'll take over from here.

353
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,475
What?

354
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,633
Thought you'd be
more comfortable with this.

355
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,791
Guess I was dreaming.

356
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,157
No discussion.
Get out!

357
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,749
May I speak to the maitre d'?

358
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,035
I have a message for a guest
at your restaurant. Eva Gjelseth.

359
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:20,795
She's alone, under the balcony.
She has long, blond hair.

360
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:27,308
You can't miss her.
Tell her to meet Tom at Waterfront.

361
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,636
Thank you.

362
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,717
I'm expecting a girl
called Eva Gjelseth.

363
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,558
She has a pink sweater and blond
hair. Tell her to meet Tom in Shed 3.

364
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,795
Eva?

365
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,669
-He's waiting for you in Shed 3.
-Where?

366
