00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:09,348
That's what
they say?

524
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:11,350
The trouble is
they talkin'
about me.

525
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:12,434
Oh, girl.

526
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:14,228
Oh, it's true, Ruby,
and you know it.

527
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:17,231
I just let
everybody push
me around!

528
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,857
Oh, come on,
Gladys.

529
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,235
What's
Mr. Brooks
done now?

530
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:23,153
Oh, the way
that man courted me

531
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:25,155
before we
got married.

532
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:28,409
Sugar-sweet names
he called me.

533
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,327
And the day after
we got married,

534
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:33,539
he started
callin' me
Mrs. Brooks!

535
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:34,748
And now he's
got me keepin'

536
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:35,833
that ol'
appointment book,

537
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,167
so he'll know
what I'm doin'

538
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,712
every minute
of the day.

539
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,255
One of these days,
I'm gonna throw

540
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,257
that appointment
book out the window!

541
00:26:43,465 --> 00:26:45,134
That's what
I'm gonna do!

542
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:46,885
The only thing
I don't have
to put in it

543
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,763
is when I cough
or go to the bathroom.

544
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,223
Ah, child.

545
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:52,599
And don't let
me even look

546
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:54,435
like I'm gonna
disagree with him.

547
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:57,146
Then he rants
and raves up a storm,

548
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:59,273
act like he's gonna
thunder and lightnin'

549
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:02,067
for 40 days
and 40 nights!

550
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:03,319
If there
ever was a man

551
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:04,737
who knows
how to get mad,

552
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:06,697
it's Mr. Brooks.

553
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:10,034
Last week,
I overspent on
buyin' groceries.

554
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:12,786
Talk about a man
carryin' on!

555
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:14,913
You would
have thought
that 17 cents

556
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:18,625
was gonna
cause a panic
down on wall street!

557
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,252
I'm on your
side, girl.

558
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,087
But I will say this
for Mr. Brooks:

559
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:23,797
He does have
good intentions.

560
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:25,215
My granny
always said,

561
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,760
"the road to hell
is paved with good
intentions."

562
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:29,178
My granny always
used to say

563
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:31,138
there's some good
in everybody.

564
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:33,140
Well, if there is
some good in Mr. Brooks,

565
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:34,516
he done done
a Houdini with it

566
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:36,060
and made it
disappear,

567
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:38,062
'cause you sure
can't see it.

568
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,397
All in all,
child...

569
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:41,690
I don't know.

570
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,276
And don't let me
even think about

571
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:46,612
askin' him
to take me
somewhere.

572
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,198
Then he tells me
about his mother,

573
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:51,450
what a good
woman she was,

574
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:54,661
and how easy we
modern women have it...

575
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,456
And how she worked
from sunup to sundown.

576
00:27:57,664 --> 00:27:59,458
To hear him talk
about that woman,

577
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:02,419
you'd think she
was Joan of arc,

578
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:05,172
virgin Mary,
and Aretha Franklin

579
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:08,300
all rolled
into one!

580
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:10,010
Aw, Gladys, don't be
so hard on yourself.

581
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,846
No, no, no, Ruby,
I made up my mind
this mornin'.

582
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:15,265
I'm keepin'
a longtime
promise.

583
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:18,936
I am leavin'
Mr. Brooks!

584
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:20,813
Girl, you know
it ain't all that easy--

585
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:22,773
tellin' me that
I can't buy
a new dress

586
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:25,067
for my own
daughter's
weddin'!

587
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:25,984
Well, if there's
such a thing

588
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:27,736
as a last straw,

589
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:29,863
that was it!

590
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,949
Now, Gladys, we all
know Mr. Brooks

591
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:33,242
has his problems,

592
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,993
but that don't mean
you gotta leave him.

593
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,328
After all,
there is such
a thing

594
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:37,871
as jumpin' from
the refrigerator

595
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,039
into the
fryin' pan.

596
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:41,625
Oh, now, Ruby,
be serious.

597
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,336
I am!
Just as serious
as cancer!

598
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:46,755
At least he
is dependable.

599
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:48,298
Hmm.

600
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:49,675
He ain't never been
known to mess up

601
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:50,884
with a piece
of money.

602
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:52,761
Well, a lot of good
that does me!

603
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,973
Everything
in the house
is in his name!

604
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,558
My name don't
appear on nothin'

605
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:00,310
except
the income tax
deduction form.

606
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,020
But you still
gotta admit--

607
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:04,773
no, Ruby, I made up
my mind this mornin'.

608
00:29:04,982 --> 00:29:06,984
I'm leavin'!

609
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:10,362
[Sweetmeat]
Deep in the heart
of the kingdom sticks,

610
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:12,573
the animals
had a poolroom,

611
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:15,033
but the baboon
was slick.

612
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:16,326
Till up jumped
the monkey

613
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,704
from
coconut grove.

614
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,289
He said, "let me get
some of this money

615
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:23,125
"'fore this
place close."

616
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,169
Baboon said,
"man,

617
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,629
"you wanna shoot
some pool?"

618
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:31,675
Monkey said,
"I can't shoot
no pool,

619
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:33,594
"but if you'll
pull up a stump

620
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:35,721
"to fit
your rump,

621
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,098
"I'll play you
some cooncan

622
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:40,017
"till your
rear end jump."

623
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,643
[All laughing]

624
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:43,145
Hey,
John Henry.

625
00:29:43,353 --> 00:29:44,688
Gideon still
up on the roof?

626
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:46,023
I've asked
you not to mention

627
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,065
that name
to me.

628
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:48,734
Boy, that Gideon
is sure one

629
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:50,319
outta sight
youngster.

630
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,906
You're entitled
to your opinion.

631
00:29:54,114 --> 00:29:55,866
And everyone is,
I suppose.

632
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:58,577
We'll just
wait and see.

633
00:29:58,785 --> 00:29:59,703
Eh, sweetmeat?

634
00:29:59,912 --> 00:30:00,829
Hmm?

635
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,499
I fixed his wagon
this mornin'.

636
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:06,502
Really
laid it on him,
huh, John Henry?

637
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,628
Thanks,
homer.

638
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:09,171
Put my
foot down.

639
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:10,506
Still on strike,
ain't he?

640
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,841
He'll be
a man soon.

641
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,594
And then there'll just
be me and Mrs. Brooks.

642
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:17,387
Still don't know
how come you're
so lucky

643
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,264
to get a good woman
like Mrs. Brooks.

644
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:22,309
What do you
mean, luck?

645
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:25,854
Mrs. Brooks
is no accident!

646
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:29,149
Why, I created her
with these very hands.

647
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:32,110
Oh, talk that talk,
John Henry.

648
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,987
Trouble with you,
Preston,

649
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:37,157
is that you don't
understand women.

650
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,993
Controlling women
is an art.

651
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,287
You have to have
a certain knack.

652
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:43,413
[Laughing]

653
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:45,165
[Preston]
Man, you're really
on a trip.

654
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:47,292
One of these days,
Mrs. Brooks is gonna
wake up

655
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,670
and turn you
completely around.

656
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:51,421
Preston,

657
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,423
the possibility
of Mrs. Brooks being

658
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:55,300
able to,
as you say,

659
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:57,886
turn me completely
around is about

660
00:30:58,095 --> 00:31:00,847
as likely as
your going skiing
in purgatory.

661
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:08,814
[All laughing]

662
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:14,987
Don't be
so mean,
John Henry.

663
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:17,281
This is the time,
brothers!

664
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:18,532
Can I help you,
brother?

665
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,409
Yes!

666
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:22,369
I'd like to speak
to the barber
who's in charge here.

667
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:24,997
You're looking
at him.

668
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:27,082
Do you, uh, own
this place, brother?

669
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,418
Lock, stock
and barrel.

670
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,837
Eh, right on!

671
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:35,173
Uh...I'd like to put
this in your window.

672
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:36,091
It's for
the legal defense

673
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,469
of brother
Ali gamma.

674
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:41,221
This is
the time,
brothers!

675
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,472
This is
the time!

676
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,559
The honky dog is
gonna have to pay.

677
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:46,727
See, we must
begin to unite

678
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:48,395
on the basis
of our color,

679
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:49,688
'cause the pig
power structure

680
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:52,232
is daily becoming
more fascist.

681
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:54,818
I'll see
what we can do.

682
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,361
Right on.

683
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,156
Now all power
to the people,

684
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:00,949
blood to
the horse's brow,

685
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:04,286
and woe to those
that cannot
swim, Jim!

686
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,379
Filthy-mouth
rascal!

687
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:16,214
Calling people
animals.

688
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:18,342
Aw, John Henry,
where you coming
from?

689
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,761
The brother was right.
We gotta stick together.

690
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,179
Don't deal with
how he said it.

691
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,348
Deal with what
the man said.

692
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:26,099
They're
crazy.

693
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:27,684
Going around
talking about,

694
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:28,769
"say it loud!

695
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:30,145
"I'm black,
and I'm proud!"

You still should've
given the brother
a play, John Henry.

717
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:14,022
And you're supposed
to be a man of
principles, too.

718
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:15,982
I am a man
of principles,

719
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:18,193
but sometimes
you have to forget
about principles

720

And as
the rooster
crowed,

723
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,914
those who stood
before the bar said,

Groove with
the grape,

734
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:55,981
for it is wiser
to fly with the
fruitful grape

735
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:58,108
than it is
to be high

736
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:00,777

Preston,
oh, Preston.

748
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:35,020
When I was young
I did eagerly visit

749
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:36,855
philosophers
and saints

750
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:38,231
and heard
great arguments

00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,150
about this
and that.

752
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:43,278

I came out

753
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:45,280
the same door
I went in.

We are nothing

but a wandering
row of shadows

the Halloween lantern

762
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:21,775
Right on,

Mr. Porter fat,
Ace, deuce, Trey.

00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:25,362
On time
she came.

765
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,740
Mr. John Henry Brooks,
3-3-3, right?

766
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:33,119
Right.

767
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:37,707

And lately through
the open door,

771
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:50,929
came shining
through the dusk

772
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:54,140
an angel bearing a huge
vessel on her shoulder,

773
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:57,644
and she offered me
a taste from it,

774
00:35:57,853 --> 00:35:59,771
and I took it,
too.

775
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,898
Yes, I did.

776
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,859

the grape.

00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,866
Whooee!
How a man
can remember

00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:13,118
all those numbers
without writing them down

780
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:16,621
is a real deep,
dark mystery to me.

781
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,291
[Mr. Brooks]
It's simple
enough, sweetmeat.

782
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,126
Rolls Royce has
what they call

783
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,420
a photogenic memory.

784
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:25,589
Mmhhh!
A mind like that,

785
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:27,173
and he's only
a numbers runner.

786
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:28,341

rolls ought to be

787
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,427
down there somewhere
on wall street.

[Sweetmeat]
What's wrong
with you guys?

789
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,265
You know
as well as I do

790
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,726
that rolls Royce

791
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:43,732

on wall street
for years...

gonna be easy
to leave, but...

I--I just can't
take it anymore.

treats me like
I'm an old couch.

Oh, lord,
I don't want
anybody

to catch me
crying.

Well, well,
just in time.

how you
doing?

I'm doing it
to death.

804
00:37:25,273 --> 00:37:27,651
Well, look
who's here.
How are you, Ruby?

805
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:28,985
Fine.

806
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:30,987
And how is
Breck and Gillette

807
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:32,614
and, um,
Jean-Nate

808
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:35,408
and wild root
and Ajax?

809
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:37,953
Fine,
just fine.

810
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:40,038
All the children
is just fine.

811
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:41,164
I just came
from your door.

812
00:37:41,373 --> 00:37:42,207
Do you have
any baking powder?

813
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:47,420
Sure.
Come on.

814
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,798
Hey, Ruby, I finished
making your dress,

815
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:51,257
but the way you're
gaining weight,

816
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:52,759
I don't know
if it still fits.

817
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:54,177
Heh! Say,
have you

818
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:56,304
ever heard of
the weight watchers?

819
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,847
You ever heard
of S.I.J.?

820
00:37:58,056 --> 00:37:59,099
No. What's
S.I.J.?

821
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:01,226
"Sock in the jaw."
It's good for people

822
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:02,060
with diarrhea
of the mouth.

823
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:03,311
Mess with me
this morning,

824
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,771
I'll let you
try it.

825
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:08,024
Oh, really?
Hey, Gladys,
did you hear?

826
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,318
The welfare people
was by Ruby's house
last night

827
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:12,529
and almost
caught Wilbur.

828
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:14,489
Now, talk about
a man with heart.

829
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:17,492
Hanging from the
window 15 stories up.

830
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,661
Ruby, you should have
poured lye on his hands.

831
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:20,954
Oh, stormy,
be nice.

832
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,455
You shouldn't be
so hard on men.

833
00:38:22,664 --> 00:38:23,665
Yeah.

834
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,542
Shoot, now after what
you 2 been through,

835
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,377
I don't see
how you can even
fix your mouth

836
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,170
to say one good word
about any man?

837
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:30,338
Now, stormy,
just because

838
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:31,631
you've been burned
a few times,

839
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,924
you act like
you've got a patent

840
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,093
on being evil.

841
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:36,261
Gladys you're
always saying
that,

842
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:37,679
and you know
it's not true.

843
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:38,763
Yes, it is.

844
00:38:38,972 --> 00:38:40,015
Well,
the fact is,
Gladys,

845
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:41,766
you the one who's
always complaining

846
00:38:41,975 --> 00:38:43,351
and crying
and talking

847
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,311
about you gonna
leave Mr. Brooks,

848
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,980
and you know you
ain't going nowhere.

849
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:48,773
Yes, I am, too.

850
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:50,400
I made up my mind
this morning.

851
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:51,943
I'm leaving.

852
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:54,112
Ruby, you think
Gladys is going
anywhere?

853
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,156
My name is Hess.
I ain't in this mess.

854
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:57,407
The only reason
I stayed this long

855
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:58,992
was because
of the children,

856
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,243
but it's
different now.

857
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:01,453
Gail is
getting married

858
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:02,829
and the boys
are old enough

859
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:04,581
to take care
of themselves.

860
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:05,749
When that
preacher say,

861
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:08,293
"I now pronounce you
man and wife,"

862
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,253
I'm starting me
a new life.

863
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:13,089
Well,
I'll say.

864
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:15,425
Sit down.

865
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,093
I'll bet
you don't have

866
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:19,262
any money saved,
right, Ruby?

867
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:21,139
I told you I wasn't
in this mess.

868
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:22,807
I do too
have money.

869
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:24,934
I just haven't had
a chance to save much.

870
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:29,189
I got $27.31.

871
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:33,568
Ohh! $27.31?

872
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:35,487
Where you
planning
on going?

873
00:39:35,695 --> 00:39:39,157
To the zoo?
Ha ha ha!

874
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:40,075
Oh, come on,
Gladys...

875
00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:41,326
Oh, stormy.

876
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:43,828
Come on, I'm not
trying to hurt you.

877
00:39:44,037 --> 00:39:46,289
I am just trying
to make a point.

878
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:47,415
All right,
now after you get

879
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:49,125
the money end
straightened out,

880
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:50,168
what is the next
thing you do?

881
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:51,628
Oh,
I don't know.

882
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,880
How about
you, Ruby?

883
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:55,298
I don't know.

884
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:56,508
That ought to be
easy for you.

885
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:59,260
Wilbur is always
threatening to do it.

886
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:00,345
Pack his bags?

887
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:01,930
That's what
I'm talking about.

888
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,015
Have you got
your clothes together yet?

889
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:06,059
Well, I was gonna
take my walk first.

890
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:11,981
What kind of
a walk?

891
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,650
Well,
truthfully,

892
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:15,735
I don't think
you are ready

893
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:17,320
to leave
Mr. Brooks.

894
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:19,155
You know,
stormy Monday,

895
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:21,449
I had you wrong
for years, girl.

896
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:23,284
You do have
some sense after all.

897
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:24,452
Yeah, it was
a lousy idea

898
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:26,454
for you to leave
Mr. Brooks,

899
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:31,167
but you should
do something.

900
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:34,796
Let me think
a minute.

901
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:36,548
Hey, I'm dry
as a potato chip.

902
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:38,716
Ahem. Do you have
anything to drink?

903
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:40,802
Down in
the cabinet,
stormy.

904
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,220
Speaking of
potato chips,

905
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:43,555
you got something else
to nibble on, Gladys?

906
00:40:43,763 --> 00:40:46,891
Ruby, there's cookies
up in the cookie jar.

907
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,143
Stormy,
stormy,

908
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:49,435
what did you say
I ought to do?

909
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:51,437
This ought
to do it.

910
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,481
Oh, how about
you 2 young ladies?

911
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,984
You gonna join me,
Ruby, Gladys?

912
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,735
I do not mind
if I do

913
00:40:57,944 --> 00:40:58,903
have a
little taste

914
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,697
just for medicinal
purposes.

915
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:01,990
Now, that's
my girl.

916
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,199
You 2 go
right ahead.

917
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:04,200
You know Mr. Brooks
don't like--

918
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,493
see?
You see?

919
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:07,287
Do you see what
I am talking about?

920
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:10,248
Yeah, all right,
but not too much.

921
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:13,001
Not so much,
stormy!

922
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,252
Okay?

923
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,588
Ahem!
Cheers!

924
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:18,339
Cheers.
Now, what did you say

925
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:19,966
I ought to do,
stormy?

926
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:21,134
Yeah, stormy,
quit stalling.

927
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:22,385
Run down
your commercial.

928
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:25,138
All right, well,
the thing is

929
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:27,765
Gladys has got
to change herself.

930
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:29,017
Change herself?

931
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:31,561
Change myself?

932
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:34,772
That's right.

933
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,150
Wait, wait,
Gladys, sit.

934
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:38,151
Let me run it
down to you.

935
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:47,327
Good god!

936
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,329
Mmm-mmm!

937
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:51,581
I sure hope
I hit today.

938
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:53,875
I got to do me some
mean chippie chasing,

939
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,293
and for me
to do that,

940
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:57,879
I need some very heavy
Greens in my pocket.

941
00:41:58,087 --> 00:41:58,796
[Porter fat]
Hey, sweetmeat.

942
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:00,381
Yeah?

943
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,259
You sure talk bad
for a married man.

944
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:05,720
Hey, man,
my wife's the one

945
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:07,430
that's married,
not me.

946
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,748
Hey, there's
my man!

947
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:35,333
My main man.

948
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:36,501
What's happening,
fun loving?

949
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:37,961
What you want
to happen, baby?

950
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:39,087
You got it.

951
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:40,213
Oh, yeah?
Well,

952
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:42,215
there's green lights
all the way, baby.

953
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:44,300
Nothing but green
lights all the way.

954
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:46,344
Say, John Henry,
you about ready for me?

955
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:49,222
Sure thing, fun loving.
Right this way.

956
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,557
That's my man.
Okay, let's get it on.

957
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:53,643
I got a lot of business
to take care of today

958
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:55,812
all up and down
these mean streets.

959
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,438
Not that it worries
me none, though,

960
00:42:57,647 --> 00:43:00,108
heh! 'Cause I ain't
givin' up nothing.

961
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:02,110
I wouldn't give
a crippled crab
a crutch

962
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,779
if I owned
a lumberyard.

963
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:07,532
[Sweetmeat]
Fun loving,
don't be so mean.

964
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,075
Hey, sweetmeat,
your post.

965
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:10,868
Man
your post!

966
00:43:11,077 --> 00:43:12,078
Hey, lady,
you can't come
in here.

967
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:13,663
No ladies
allowed.

968
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,207
The kingdom
of god is not
a matter of talk,

969
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,375
but of power.

970
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,377
[Mr. Brooks]
Don't let her in!

971
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:20,712
Choose,
then!

972
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,046
Am I to come
to you

973
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:23,923
with a rod
in my hand,

974
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:26,676
or in a sweet
and gentle spirit?

975
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:28,428
Shoot your
best shot,
lady.

976
00:43:28,594 --> 00:43:30,888
[Laughing]

977
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:32,974
"Oh, be proud
of yourselves,

978
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:34,225
"for his heart,

979
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:36,060
"though he is
absent in body,

980
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:38,354
"he is present
in spirit,

981
00:43:38,563 --> 00:43:40,189
"and his judgment
upon the sinner

982
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:41,482
"is already
given."

983
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:43,318
Yes, Jesus, yes!
Hallelujah!

984
00:43:43,526 --> 00:43:46,738
Given as if he were
indeed present.

985
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:48,489
Hold on there,
sweetmeat.

986
00:43:48,698 --> 00:43:50,325
Come on, sweetmeat!
Come on, baby!

987
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:52,744
[Mr. Brooks]
Hold on to her!

988
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:54,245
Sorry, lady,

989
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:55,580
we love
the good
lord, too,

990
00:43:55,788 --> 00:43:56,789
but you're
gonna have to

991
00:43:56,956 --> 00:43:59,167
work your show
from the outside.

992
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,544
I ain't never let
a lady past me,

993
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:03,796
not one,
not one,
lord,

994
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:05,340
and there ain't
no sense in a boy

995
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:06,716
breaking a good
record like that,

996
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:08,426
nooo, lord!

997
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:11,179
Hey, preach, sweetmeat!
Preach, baby! Ha ha!

998
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:13,639
"The man
who sins

999
00:44:13,848 --> 00:44:15,808
"is to be
consigned
to Satan

"for the
destruction

"in the name
of the lord
Jesus Jehovah!"

1004
00:44:25,651 --> 00:44:27,862
[Mr. Brooks]
Come on, sister,
save us!

1005
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,114
Amen!

1006
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:32,367
[All laughing]

1007
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,083
[Mr. Brooks]
Stop right
there, sir.

1008
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,959
Stop dead
in your
tracks.

1009
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:43,086
Don't you take

1010
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,672
another step
further.

1011
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:47,757
The treatment.

1012
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:50,885
Oh, John Henry.

1013
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:53,012
[Stifled laughter]

1014
00:45:00,978 --> 00:45:08,236
Come on, get with it,
baby! Clean it up.

1015
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:10,405
Boy, them little old
ladies sure tickle me.

1016
00:45:10,613 --> 00:45:11,739
They ought to be
in the suburbs

1017
00:45:11,948 --> 00:45:12,990
spreading
the word.

1018
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,951
It's whitey
who needs
to be reminded

1019
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,160
that the
Bible says,

1020
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:17,578
"you got to reap
what you sow."

1021
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:24,085
Yeah.
Hey, Preston.

1022
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:26,379
"And in
his judgment

1023
00:45:26,587 --> 00:45:28,131
"upon the sinner

1024
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:32,427
"is already given."

1025
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:33,803
You better
watch it,
sweetmeat.

1026
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:36,305
I heard that god
was a black woman.

1027
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:39,392
Mmn-mmn-mmn!

1028
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,979
And you know
what that means.

1029
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:44,981
We all gonna
have to pay

1030
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:47,692
some mighty
heavy dues.

1031
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,445
With god
a black woman,

1032
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:56,492
we'd be
in troubllllle!

1033
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:58,161
Oh, why don't
you cats wise up?

1034
00:45:58,369 --> 00:45:59,412
Anybody
can talk about

1035
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,038
what's wrong
with black women.

1036
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:02,206
I want to hear
somebody talk

1037
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:03,624
about what's
right with them.

1038
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,169
Black women

1039
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:09,255
are evvvvvil!

1040
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:11,466
[All laughing]

1041
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,477
[Stormy]
Now just a little
bit on the top here.

1042
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:23,853
Oh, not too much
off the top.

1043
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:25,188
She could look
like a man.

1044
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:26,981
I don't want to look
like no man, stormy.

1045
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,316
Are y'all
so backward?

1046
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:31,569
I mean, really, do I
look like a man?

1047
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:32,737
Why don't
you touch it up

1048
00:46:32,945 --> 00:46:33,863
a bit more
over there?

1049
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:36,699
Who is doing
this chick, huh?

1050
00:46:36,908 --> 00:46:40,536
Move! Ruby!

1051
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:42,330
Hold your
head up.

1052
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:45,583
I think
we almost
got it.

1053
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,877
Well...

1054
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,795
I think
that's it.

1055
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:52,757
Okay. Look.

1056
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:54,217
Give me
your drink.

1057
00:47:02,892 --> 00:47:05,728
Is this me?

1058
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:08,064
You do look
sort of different.

1059
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:40,763
Whoop!
Ha ha ha!

1060
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:43,015
Hey!

1061
00:47:43,224 --> 00:47:44,809
Hey, I see
you're still

1062
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:46,352
in the CP time,
sport.

1063
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:47,520
What you talking
about, man?

1064
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:48,479
I'm right
on time.

1065
00:47:48,688 --> 00:47:49,689
Shoot.

1066
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:51,023
Yeah.

1067
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:52,316
So, what you
been up to, huh?

1068
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:53,943
Well, I'm just
there, you know,

1069
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:55,194
but being careful.

1070
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:56,487
Yeah, I dig.

1071
00:47:56,696 --> 00:48:01,617
Just skippin'
on by.

1072
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:03,369
Man,

1073
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:04,453
it's been
a long time

1074
00:48:04,662 --> 00:48:07,164
since I've
been up here.

1075
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:08,332
Remember I
used to have

1076
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:09,959
that pigeon Coop
right over there?

1077
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:11,294
Yeah.

1078
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:16,549
All the hours I used
to spend up here.

1079
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:18,676
You wouldn't even
allow me up here,
dude.

1080
00:48:18,884 --> 00:48:21,053
Heh heh! Man,
it sure seems

1081
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:23,889
like a long
time ago.

1082
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:27,226
It's funny how time
just dances by.

1083
00:48:27,435 --> 00:48:28,477
Heh heh heh!

1084
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:30,021
Hey, hey,
remember
that chick

1085
00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:31,689
across the
street, huh?

1086
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:32,857
That big-legged
chick

1087
00:48:33,065 --> 00:48:34,025
you brought up
here that time?

1088
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:34,900
What was her name?

1089
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:36,277
What you
talking about?

1090
00:48:36,485 --> 00:48:37,778
Come on now, man.
You remember,

1091
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:38,988
now what was
her name?

1092
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:40,323
Remember you
got upset

1093
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,824
because during
the whole Johnson,

1094
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,576
she couldn't stop
popping her gum.

1095
00:48:43,784 --> 00:48:45,328
Oh!
You remember?

1096
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:46,454
What's
her name?

1097
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:47,622
Aw, man!

1098
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,582
Gloria!
Right. That's
her name!

1099
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,668
Gloria.
Gloria...

1100
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:53,669
Cook, cook!

1101
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:57,214
Yeah, yeah!

1102
00:48:57,423 --> 00:48:58,716
See, you
remember, man.

1103
00:48:58,924 --> 00:49:00,843
Yeah,
I remember, man.

1104
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:02,261
I thought you wanted
to talk to me

1105
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,930
about something,
anyway.

1106
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:07,808
Yeah, well, uh,

1107
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:10,478
it's about dad.

1108
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:11,937
Tsk! That all
you want to talk
about?

1109
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:14,857
Hey, wait, wait.

1110
00:49:15,066 --> 00:49:17,818
Now, I talked
to him a long time
last night.

1111
00:49:18,027 --> 00:49:19,487
He's really
getting upset.

1112
00:49:19,695 --> 00:49:22,239
Man, that dude
is always upset
about something.

1113
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:24,241
You could listen
to what I have to say.

1114
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,118
All right,
go ahead.
Go ahead.

1115
00:49:26,327 --> 00:49:27,495
You know how
the old man likes

1116
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:29,914
to keep his
business to
himself.

1117
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:31,082
Well, neighbors
are talking,

1118
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,792
and it's
getting to him.

1119
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,919
That's what this
whole thing is about,
big brother.

1120
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:36,712
Hey, dad's
really a nice guy

1121
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:38,714
when you get
to know him.

1122
00:49:38,923 --> 00:49:41,676
You want to know what's
really happening with him?

1123
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:43,886
He's lonely.

1124
00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:45,638
Now, I didn't
understand that
before,

1125
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:48,015
but when you move out
on your own,

1126
00:49:48,224 --> 00:49:53,896
you begin to
see things.

1127
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:56,273
Yeah, I hear you
humming, but I
ain't coming.

1128
00:49:56,482 --> 00:49:57,942
Look, Gideon,

1129
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,402
all I'm asking
you to do is

1130
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,153
to just meet
the old man

1131
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:02,488
halfway,
that's all.

1132
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:06,534
Man, now, dad is
living in the 1930s.

1133
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,619
And you asking me
to meet him halfway?

1134
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:11,163
Ain't this some
incredible stuff?

1135
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:13,040
Now, instead of
giving out advice
like that,

1136
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:15,376
you ought to get
your own house
in order.

1137
00:50:15,584 --> 00:50:18,462
Now, what do
you mean by that?

1138
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:20,131
I've done said
what I had to say.

1139
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:21,465
People who live
in glass houses

1140
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:24,969
just ought
to be cool,
that's all.

1141
00:50:25,177 --> 00:50:26,595
If you've got
something to say,

1142
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:28,222
why don't you just
come out and say it?

1143
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,066
All right,
I will.

1144
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:42,153
Tell me, man,
you got anything
against sisters?

1145
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:43,571
Heh heh heh!

1146
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:45,865
Oh, wow.
I haven't got

1147
00:50:46,073 --> 00:50:47,616
anything
against
sisters.

1148
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:50,578
Why?

1149
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:52,329
How come I ain't
never seen you uptown

1150
00:50:52,538 --> 00:50:53,748
with no
chicks,
then?

1151
00:50:53,956 --> 00:50:55,332
Yeah, so?

1152
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,043
So?

1153
00:50:58,252 --> 00:50:59,628
So there's
a whole lot

1154
00:50:59,837 --> 00:51:01,297
of boss sisters
out there, man.

1155
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:03,215
Can't you
find one?

1156
00:51:03,424 --> 00:51:04,800
Hey, Gideon,
look, I don't know

1157
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:09,221
what you're
talking about.

1158
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,308
You want to know
what I think?

1159
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:13,601
I think you're
afraid of sisters

1160
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,936
because you can't
deal with them.

1161
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:17,855
Yeah, that's
right.

1162
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:19,398
You the kind
of dude who
winds up

1163
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:22,401
marrying white.

1164
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,944
You probably got
some gray chick

1165
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:27,490
on the side right
now. What you think
about that?

1166
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:28,866
I just think you're
one crazy nigger,

1167
00:51:29,074 --> 00:51:30,409
that's what
I think.

1168
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:31,827
You run into some
dynamite smoke

1169
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:33,454
or something?
'Cause if you did,

1170
00:51:33,662 --> 00:51:34,914
give me some

1171
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:36,332
so I can be
crazy like you.

1172
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,918
Well, do you?

1173
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:40,336
Do I what?

1174
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:41,629
Do you have
a white girlfriend?

1175
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:43,130
Look,
I don't know

1176
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:44,673
what you're
talking about.

1177
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:47,635
Booker, why don't you
stop playing games, man?

1178
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,720
You were seen going down
to Terry's with a blonde.

1179
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:51,764
You were seen
at the boondocks
with a blonde.

1180
00:51:51,972 --> 00:51:52,890
So I go out
with a white girl

1181
00:51:53,098 --> 00:51:54,433
every now
and then.

1182
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:56,060
What are you getting
so excited about?

1183
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:58,062
It's not
your business.

1184
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:00,898
It's highly
personal.

1185
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:02,024
I happen to dig

1186
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,234
a certain quality
in a chick,

1187
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:05,569
and I haven't
met a sister

1188
00:52:05,778 --> 00:52:09,365
that I can groove
with, that's all.

1189
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:12,827
Man...

1190
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:17,665
Heh heh heh!

1191
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:19,583
Oh, hey...

1192
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:21,627
Hey, Booker,

1193
00:52:21,836 --> 00:52:25,297
sisters are some
very beautiful people,
man.

1194
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:26,674
We can't
afford to be
getting into

1195
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:28,759
no negative
things with
them.

1196
00:52:28,968 --> 00:52:31,136
How can we
build a nation
of strong families

1197
00:52:31,345 --> 00:52:32,346
without them?

1198
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,056
Mm-hmm,
tell me
anything.

1199
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:35,558
Spit on
my back.

1200
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:37,142
Tell me
it's raining!

1201
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:38,769
Next thing I know,
you'd be telling me

1202
00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:39,812
you came
up here

1203
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,814
just to build
a strong family.

1204
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:43,440
Well, yeah!
Yeah, otherwise,

1205
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:45,276
I'd have moved out
like you did.

1206
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:46,402
Man, who I
sleep with

1207
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,736
is my own
personal
business.

1208
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:49,989
Oh, no, man, no!
Who you sleep with,

1209
00:52:50,197 --> 00:52:51,490
the first face
you see in the
morning,

1210
00:52:51,699 --> 00:52:53,200
is very
significant,
man.

1211
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:54,743
That's where
you get your
energy from.

1212
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:57,037
It's your mirror,
Booker. Can you dig it?

1213
00:52:57,246 --> 00:52:59,081
You ought to be
getting your black
thing together

1214
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,457
instead of
going around

1215
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,251
sleeping with
the enemy, huh?

1216
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:03,961
People are people!

1217
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:05,671
That white chick
ain't nobody's enemy.

1218
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:08,299
She's an individual,
an individual,

1219
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:09,800
and a beautiful
one at that,

1220
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:11,427
but that's
not the point.

1221
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:14,430
The thing is,
it's me. Me!

1222
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:15,681
And if you don't
understand that,

1223
00:53:15,848 --> 00:53:17,892
then shame
on your black hide.

1224
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,560
No, man, you've got
to get out of that

1225
00:53:19,768 --> 00:53:22,229
"me, me" thing.
Why don't you wake up?

1226
00:53:22,438 --> 00:53:24,440
It ain't about
yourself, man.

1227
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:25,566
What are you
getting so excited

1228
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:30,905
about a girl that
you don't even know?

1229
00:53:31,113 --> 00:53:32,281
I don't want
to see my brother

1230
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:37,328
running around
being a hypocrite.

1231
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:40,289
Now, I mean if you're
into a white thing, then--

1232
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:43,125
then stop
talking black.

1233
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,794
You confusing
people, Booker,

1234
00:53:46,003 --> 00:53:48,088
sneaking around.

1235
00:53:48,297 --> 00:53:51,759
Be a man!

1236
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:53,886
Oh, later
for you,

1237
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:54,970
'cause I ain't
got time

1238
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:56,138
to be
standing around

1239
00:53:56,347 --> 00:53:58,891
listening to a whole
bunch of nonsense.

1240
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,770
Well, how about it,
super spade?

1241
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:04,396
You gonna take
the white girl
to the wedding?

1242
00:54:04,605 --> 00:54:05,481
I'm sure mama
and daddy'll be

1243
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:07,274
highly
impressed, huh?

1244
00:54:07,483 --> 00:54:09,234
All right,
Einstein!
All right!

1245
00:54:09,443 --> 00:54:10,945
I know what you need.
I haven't given you

1246
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:12,237
a dusting off
in a long time.

1247
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:13,322
Booker, I don't
want to get into

1248
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,032
no physical thing
with you.

1249
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,076
I'm just asking you
to be a black man,
that's all.

1250
00:54:17,284 --> 00:54:18,243
Stop trifling,
that's all.

1251
00:54:18,452 --> 00:54:22,414
No, man, I know
exactly what you mean!

1252
00:54:22,581 --> 00:54:23,499
Come on,
get up,
chump!

1253
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:26,043
I'm gonna rock
your sky!

1254
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:27,920
Hey, man, put down
that warrior, huh?

1255
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:29,213
You can rock
all the skies
you want,

1256
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:30,714
I just want my cut,
that's all.

1257
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:33,217
Turkey!

1258
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,552
Talking about
being a man, huh?

1259
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:36,887
Where's
your heart?

1260
00:54:37,096 --> 00:54:40,057
In my head where
it's supposed to be.

1261
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:43,227
All right,
chump.

1262
00:54:43,435 --> 00:54:45,771
Henhouse!

1263
00:54:45,938 --> 00:54:48,357
You put down
that spear. You
afraid of a fair one?

1264
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:49,692
What's the matter?
Can't you do

1265
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,235
anything besides
talk, hypocrite?

1266
00:55:03,497 --> 00:55:05,749
What's the matter,
John Wayne?

1267
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,210
You put down
that spear, and I'll
teach you a lesson.

1268
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:10,337
I'm already teaching
you one, man.

1269
00:55:10,546 --> 00:55:12,923
It ain't about
a whole lot of talk.

1270
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:14,675
It's about action,
can you dig it?

1271
00:55:14,883 --> 00:55:16,927
Action!

1272
00:55:17,136 --> 00:55:18,470
Oh,
later for you.

1273
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:21,223
I ain't got time
to be bothered.

1274
00:55:21,432 --> 00:55:24,810
What's the matter, man?
Where's your heart at?

1275
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:26,770
You put down that spear,
and I'll show you.

1276
00:55:26,979 --> 00:55:28,063
Talk's cheap,
chump.

1277
00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:31,859
Yeah?

1278
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:33,110
You gonna put down
that spear?

1279
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:37,823
Can a
buffalo skate?

1280
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:39,324
Later for you.

1281
00:55:50,502 --> 00:55:54,048
[Ruby]
It do look
different.

1282
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:56,425
Sort of like...

1283
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:58,260
Sort of African.

1284
00:55:58,469 --> 00:55:59,595
Yeah,
Gladys,

1285
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:01,638
that's exactly
what you look like.

1286
00:56:01,847 --> 00:56:04,016
You like one of them
African queens.

1287
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:05,601
Ohh!

1288
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:09,313
An African queen!

1289
00:56:09,521 --> 00:56:11,565
Ruby, go upstairs
and see if Gideon's

1290
00:56:11,774 --> 00:56:13,150
up on the roof
for me, please?

1291
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:14,443
We don't have
much time,

1292
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:16,653
and he can be
our consultant.

1293
00:56:16,862 --> 00:56:18,447
Ok, now,
let me see

1294
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:19,323
if I can get
these on you.

1295
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:23,285
Ohh!

1296
00:56:23,494 --> 00:56:24,620
Now, if you're
going to be

1297
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:25,913
an African queen,

1298
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:27,956
you've got to carry
yourself like one.

1299
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:33,003
Ok.

1300
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:35,964
Now walk.

1301
00:56:36,173 --> 00:56:38,509
Hold your
chin up,
Gladys.

1302
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:41,678
Right. D-don't slump
your shoulders.

1303
00:56:41,887 --> 00:56:44,932
That's it.
Now walk proud,

1304
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,768
proud and
beautiful.

1305
00:56:47,976 --> 00:56:48,852
Ohh!

1306
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:52,815
Oh, yeah!

1307
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:54,483
That's it.
Ok, let's go.

1308
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:56,568
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1309
00:56:56,777 --> 00:56:59,530
I got just one
last thing to do.

1310
00:57:16,463 --> 00:57:17,589
[Shouting
and laughing]

1311
00:57:31,937 --> 00:57:33,814
That's boss,
my man.

1312
00:57:34,022 --> 00:57:35,149
Real boss.

1313
00:57:35,357 --> 00:57:38,610
Hey, let
me dust you
off there.

1314
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,946
Then you'll be
cleaner than the
board of health.

1315
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:42,156
Why not?

1316
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:43,365
I'm as free
as the breeze,

1317
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:45,117
and I do
as I please.

1318
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:46,535
Besides,
don't take nothin'

1319
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:47,703
but a little
money.

1320
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:49,663
Here you go,
brother.

1321
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:50,998
Fun loving?

1322
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,249
You're a scholar
and a gentleman.

1323
00:57:52,457 --> 00:57:53,417
Thank you.

1324
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:54,543
Say, sweetmeat?

1325
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,211
Mm-hmm?

1326
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,629
Well, now,
I don't mean

1327
00:57:57,796 --> 00:58:00,591
to be dippin' into
y'all's business,

1328
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,885
but I've been
listening to
you dudes

1329
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:05,554
talk about womens,
and I want to
run down

1330
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:07,973
a little
somethin' to ya.

1331
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:12,769
Now, all you need
to get a woman
is a strong rep.

1332
00:58:12,978 --> 00:58:16,231
Hey, what'd
I say?

1333
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,901
Every woman
in the streets

1334
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:20,319
wants a piece
of me.

1335
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:24,156
They call me sweet...
Ahhh

1336
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:27,618
Peter Jeter,
the womb beater,

1337
00:58:27,826 --> 00:58:30,454
the baby maker,
and the cradle shaker,

1338
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,748
the deer slayer,
the buck binder,

1339
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:34,791
and the
womens finder.

1340
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,086
I am known
from the gold coast

1341
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:39,671
to the rocky shores
of Maine.

1342
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,298
Fun loving
is my name,

1343
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:44,343
unh, and love
is my game.

1344
00:58:44,509 --> 00:58:46,386
He said, "love
is my game."

1345
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:47,930
I'm the bed
Tucker,

1346
00:58:48,138 --> 00:58:50,390
the milk shaker,
the record breaker,

1347
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,517
and the
population maker,

1348
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:54,603
the humdinger,
the gunslinger,

1349
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:56,188
and the
baby bringer.

1350
00:58:56,396 --> 00:58:57,898
I am
fun loving,

1351
00:58:58,106 --> 00:58:59,483
fun loving
the hard hitter,

1352
00:58:59,691 --> 00:59:01,693
and the
poly-nuci
gitter.

1353
00:59:01,902 --> 00:59:03,487
The fudge,
the sludge,

1354
00:59:03,695 --> 00:59:05,781
the women's pet,
the men's fret,

1355
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:08,450
and the family's
pinup boy.

1356
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:10,369
Fun loving,
the trickster.

1357
00:59:10,577 --> 00:59:12,746
I said, fun loving,
the Berry picker.

1358
00:59:12,955 --> 00:59:15,457
The city slicker,
and the candy licker.

1359
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,001
I ain't
giving up
nothing

1360
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,170
but bubblegum
and hard times,

1361
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:23,757
and I'm fresh out
of bubblegum.

1362
00:59:23,966 --> 00:59:26,802
I'm the man
who walked
the water

1363
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,263
and tied the whale's
tail in a knot.

1364
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:31,473
I taught the fish
how to swim,

1365
00:59:31,682 --> 00:59:34,017
crossed the burning
sand, and shook
the devil's hand.

1366
00:59:34,226 --> 00:59:37,062
I rolled
around the world

1367
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:41,066
on a snail carryin'
a sack that said
"air mail."

1368
00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:43,527
I walked 49 miles
of barbed wire,

1369
00:59:43,735 --> 00:59:46,196
and I use
a cobra snake
for a necktie.

1370
00:59:46,405 --> 00:59:47,906
Yes, I am hemp
the demp,

1371
00:59:48,115 --> 00:59:49,157
the women's champ.

1372
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:51,159
Women fight
for my delight.

1373
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:54,705
I am a
baaad dude.

1374
00:59:54,913 --> 00:59:57,416
Johnny ripsaw,
the devil's
son-in-law.

1375
00:59:57,624 --> 01:00:00,752
I gave a highway
patrolman a
speeding ticket

1376
01:00:00,961 --> 01:00:03,505
and sold
a blind man
a flashlight.

1377
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:06,466
I am the only man
in the world

1378
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:09,594
that knows why
white milk
make yellow butter.

1379
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:11,930
I even know
where the lights go

1380
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:14,308
when you cut
the switch off.

1381
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:18,770
Now, I might not be
the baaaaddest man
in the world

1382
01:00:18,979 --> 01:00:20,605
but I'm
in the top 2,

1383
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:24,693
and my father
is gettin' old.

1384
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:27,029
"My father
is gettin' old."

1385
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:41,710
The queen
visits the king!

1386
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:42,794
The door,
sweetmeat.

1387
01:00:43,003 --> 01:00:43,920
Oh, lordy.

1388
01:00:44,129 --> 01:00:44,963
You can't
come in here.

1389
01:00:45,172 --> 01:00:46,340
No women
allowed.

1390

require my wife

1564
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:43,024
"to save the trays
from TV dinners."

1565
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:44,818
The trays from--

1566
01:08:45,026 --> 01:08:47,111
"from now on,
I will give my wife
a weekly allowance.

1567
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,198
"I will call her Gladys,
and not Mrs. Brooks.

1568
01:08:50,406 --> 01:08:51,741
"I will allow
her to work

1569
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,535
"as a manicurist
in my barbershop."

1570
01:08:53,743 --> 01:08:54,828
Over my
dead body!

1571
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:55,912
"I will no longer--',

1572
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,288
enough!

1573
01:08:57,497 --> 01:09:00,041
I said
that's
enough!

1574
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,126
I absolutely
refuse

1575
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,920
to listen
to any more.

1576
01:09:04,128 --> 01:09:05,296
Now, John Henry--

1577
01:09:05,505 --> 01:09:06,589
but daddy,
I'm not even
half through!

1578
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:13,012
Gail, I said
that's enough!

1579
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:14,973
What's the phone
doing off the hook?

1580
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:17,392
Oh, my god!
Marvin!

1581
01:09:23,064 --> 01:09:25,608
Oh, no.

1582
01:09:25,817 --> 01:09:26,860
He hung up!

1583
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:28,236
I give up!

1584
01:09:28,444 --> 01:09:29,863
I'm going
to my room!

1585
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:31,906
Good!

1586
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:33,533
Hyah!
Cha cha!

1587
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:34,784
Hyah!

1588
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:37,078
Hyah! Hyah!

1589
01:09:37,287 --> 01:09:38,454
All right.

1590
01:09:38,663 --> 01:09:40,164
All right.

1591
01:09:40,373 --> 01:09:41,749
Gideon, will you
please report on

1592
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,710
what's happened
so we can get
phase 3 started?

1593
01:09:43,918 --> 01:09:45,503
Okay.

1594
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:47,130
Phase 1: Took over
the barbershop.

1595
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:49,090
Right.
Check.

1596
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:51,676
Phase 2: Set up pickets
all around the building.

1597
01:09:51,843 --> 01:09:53,219
Check.

1598
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:54,721
Phase 3 is where
you come in,
stormy Monday.

1599
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:56,180
Gotcha.
Hyah!

1600
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:57,056
We're
ready!

1601
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:58,349
And if he still
doesn't sign,

1602
01:09:58,558 --> 01:10:04,188
then we go into
phase 4 and phase 5.

1603
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:06,566
Sometimes I wish
we didn't have to
do it like this, mama.

1604
01:10:06,774 --> 01:10:09,402
Me, too. But you know,
they say a hard head

1605
01:10:09,611 --> 01:10:12,322
makes a
soft behind.

1606
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:13,531
The way your father's
carrying on,

1607
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,283
you'd think
I was asking him

1608
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:18,119
to jump off
the London bridge.

1609
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:22,373
All I want him to do is to
relax and let me love him.

1610
01:10:22,582 --> 01:10:28,796
Ahem.
Good morning,
everybody.

1611
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:31,758
Sure is
a pretty day,
ain't it?

1612
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:32,967
Hmm.

1613
01:10:33,176 --> 01:10:35,053
Look who's
sliding in.

1614
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:36,512
Well,
how is
everybody?

1615
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,431
Look, man.
If it ain't
about dad

1616
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,432
signing that list
of demands,

1617
01:10:39,641 --> 01:10:41,267
we don't want
to hear it.

1618
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:42,435
Mama, dad's been
going through

1619
01:10:42,644 --> 01:10:43,686
a lot of
changes lately,

1620
01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:45,313
been doing
a lot of
deep thinking,

1621
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:48,691
and, uh, he's ready
to start discussing
discussing your demands.

1622
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,901
I'll bet.

1623
01:10:50,109 --> 01:10:52,904
Hey, man.
I'm trying
to talk to mama.

1624
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:54,489
See, mama,
it's like this.

1625
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:57,492
Uh, after all, we can't
forget about Gail
downstairs

1626
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,160
with a wedding
on her mind.

1627
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:01,037
What's wrong
with Gail?
Is she all right?

1628
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:03,623
Mama, now don't you
listen to this dude.

1629
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:05,208
My man, is dad ready
to sign that list?

1630
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,876
Well, see,
the thing is--

1631
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:08,878
is he ready to sign
the list or not, man?

1632
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:10,254
You see,
it's like this--

1633
01:11:10,463 --> 01:11:13,091
can you believe
that, mama? Huh?

1634
01:11:13,299 --> 01:11:15,051
Until dad's ready
to sign that
list of demands,

1635
01:11:15,259 --> 01:11:16,970
we've got nothin'
to discuss.

1636
01:11:17,178 --> 01:11:20,181
Come on, mama.
We got our staff
meeting to get to.

1637
01:11:34,112 --> 01:11:36,030
Relax,
sweetmeat.

1638
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:37,448
Relax.

1639
01:11:37,657 --> 01:11:39,492
You keep
saying that.

1640
01:11:39,701 --> 01:11:41,327
But I'm wondering
about our customers.

1641
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:44,288
Relax, sweetmeat,
and cool it.

1642
01:11:44,497 --> 01:11:46,332
Booker T. Is
negotiating
my interest.

1643
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:47,583
[Doorbell ringing]

1644
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:49,711
That's probably
him now.

1645
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:57,593
What's going on?
Gail all right?

1646
01:11:57,802 --> 01:11:59,220
Of course
she's all
right.

1647
01:11:59,429 --> 01:12:01,514
We're having a little
misunderstanding,
that's all.

1648
01:12:01,723 --> 01:12:05,977
Oh, Marvin,
am I ever glad
to see you!

1649
01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:07,145
Ugh.

1650
01:12:12,608 --> 01:12:14,110
Oh, I wanted
to call you back.

1651
01:12:14,318 --> 01:12:15,278
You're not mad,
are you?

1652
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:17,321
I'm not mad, baby.
I was just worried.

1653
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,448
What's
going on,
anyway?

1654
01:12:18,656 --> 01:12:21,451
Why the
pickets?

1655
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:23,953
I can’t
understand you,
Booker T.

1656
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:25,872
Instead of
you trying to
convince me

1657
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,248
to give in
to your father,

1658
01:12:27,457 --> 01:12:28,624
you should be
trying to
encourage me

1659
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:29,959
to stand up
to him.

1660
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:31,544
But mama,
the 2 of you

1661
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:33,337
been together
all these years.

1662
01:12:33,546 --> 01:12:36,466
Only because
I kept my mouth shut
all these years.

1663
01:12:36,674 --> 01:12:38,259
Oh, mama,
I know the
old man

1664
01:12:38,468 --> 01:12:39,761
could be a little
rough at times,

1665
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:43,514
but I thought
you loved him.

1666
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:45,183
I do.

1667
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:47,727
I love
your father.

1668
01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:49,896
In fact,
we all love
your father.

1669
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:53,066
But nobody can
live with him.

1670
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:54,692
And all the time,
I thought that
the 2 of you

1671
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,360
were really
a beautiful couple.

1672
01:12:56,569 --> 01:13:00,823
You got a lot
to learn about
women, son.

1673
01:13:01,032 --> 01:13:02,658
Never make
a woman do
anything

1674
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:05,953
to make her
lose respect
for herself.

1675
01:13:06,162 --> 01:13:07,246
Look, man.

1676
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:08,915
I think you
better go on
back downstairs.

1677
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:11,084
Yeah, the pickets
and takeover
are just light action.

1678
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:12,960
If dad don't come
through, we gonna
sock it to him.

1679
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:14,670
Right on!

1680
01:13:14,879 --> 01:13:16,589
You tell him
he got 5 minutes
to sign that list,

1681
01:13:16,798 --> 01:13:17,507
or we're comin'
out smokin'.

1682
01:13:17,715 --> 01:13:19,342
Hey, man,
I'm trying
to talk to mama.

1683
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,551
Why don't you
lighten up?

1684
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,970
You ain't talkin'
to no white girl!

1685
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:24,806
Man, you
better watch
yourself, or I'll--

1686
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:26,390
or what?

1687
01:13:26,599 --> 01:13:27,850
All right,
just keep
on, man.

1688
01:13:28,059 --> 01:13:28,893
Keep on
pushing me.

1689
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:29,852
What?

1690
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:30,895
Just keep
right on.

1691
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:32,188
You keep on!

1692
01:13:32,396 --> 01:13:35,691
[All yelling]

1693
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,402
Hey, hey, man.
Hey, calm down.

1694
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:39,904
Oh, Marvin,
I'm so glad
you're here.

1695
01:13:40,113 --> 01:13:43,366
Gideon, what has
come over you?

1696
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:45,034
Look, man,
it was bad enough

1697
01:13:45,243 --> 01:13:46,744
when you were
up here by yourself,

1698
01:13:46,953 --> 01:13:49,372
but now you got your
mother involved, too.
No good.

1699
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:51,582
I've been trying
to tell him--

1700
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:54,168
wait. You're no better,
supporting your father
trying to jive your mother.

1701
01:13:54,377 --> 01:13:55,378
Hey,
now wait
a minute, man--

1702
01:13:55,586 --> 01:13:56,546
don't deny it,
Sharrief.

1703
01:13:56,754 --> 01:13:57,713
Gail heard you
and Mr. Brooks.

1704
01:13:57,922 --> 01:13:59,632
You're just
stalling for time.

1705
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:01,134
You see that?
I told you
you was wrong--

1706
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:02,260
hey, hey!

1707
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:05,221
I say you're
both wrong.

1708
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:06,931
Fightin'
in the streets,

1709
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,349
tellin' lies.

1710
01:14:08,558 --> 01:14:11,018
Always quoting
Chairman Mao.

1711
01:14:11,227 --> 01:14:13,813
But you should
remember what
Malcolm said.

1712
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:18,943
You do not solve
a family squabble
in public.

1713
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:20,570
Gideon, look, man.
You can use those

1714
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:23,322
calculating tactics
against outsiders,

1715
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:24,407
but with
your family,

1716
01:14:24,615 --> 01:14:26,951
you use another
value system,

1717
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:30,997
one based
on love

1718
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:33,624
and respect.

1719
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,751
Sharrief,
I expected
more from you.

1720
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,545
You're supposed
to be a new black man,

1721
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:38,921
and you're
coming up shaky.

1722
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,548
But I was
doing it for
the family,

1723
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:42,049
for father, for--

1724
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:43,968
I don't see how you can
preach black liberation

1725
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:45,887
and still refuse
to support
your own mother

1726
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:48,014
in her struggle
for self-respect.

1727
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:50,808
Now, come on, man.
We gotta stop
this bickering.

1728
01:14:51,017 --> 01:14:54,854
The only valid "ism"
is "we-ism."

1729
01:14:55,062 --> 01:15:02,028
We cannot allow
differences to
separate the family.

1730
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:05,740
Sharrief, man, your mother
is fighting for her dignity.

1731
01:15:05,948 --> 01:15:07,742
You should
