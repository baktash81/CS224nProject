24
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:15,849
<i>No, no, no.</i>

25
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:19,015
- Okay. Where are you then?
<i>- It's dark, and I can't breathe.</i>

26

- I need to know where you are.
<i>- Fuck, no.</i>

27

- What did you take, Dru?
<i>- What?</i>

29
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,349
Did you take drugs, Dru?

30
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:31,849
<i>- Yeah, I did.</i>
- You shouldn't do that. What did you take?

31
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,890
<i>- Speed.</i>
- Shoot it up or snort it?

32
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:43,640
- Take a deep breath and answer me.
<i>- I can't breathe. I'm fucking scared.</i>

33
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:46,266
I understand,
but it's your own fault, isn't it?

34
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:52,141
- Dru?
<i>- Yes. Just send the fucking ambulance.</i>

35
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:55,099
Give me your address.
I'll send an ambulance and the police.

43
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:16,224

44
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:18,224
Are you a journalist?

45
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:21,015
<i>I thought I said I was.</i>
<i>I'm with the</i> Los Angeles Times.

46
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,141
<i>Is this a bad time? I can call back.</i>

47
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:26,391
Shouldn't you introduce yourself properly
before you ask questions?

48
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,473
<i>- I wanna get your side of the story.</i>
- How'd you get this number?

49
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,598
<i>- I'm writing about your case...</i>
- How'd you get this number?

50
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,266
As I said, no comment.

51
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,640
<i>- You have my number…</i>
- Baylor. No calls. I already told you.

52
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,391
Thought that was a fucking job.

53
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,349

- What is the address of your emergency?
<i>- Is this the fire department?</i>

56
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,515
No, ma'am, you've reached 911.
I can connect you to fire. Hold the line.

57
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,141
<i>- I can see the flames up the hillside.</i>
- I understand.

58
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,307

65
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,515

66
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:31,099

<i>- I'm in my car, man. Come quick!</i>

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,974
Are you in downtown Los Angeles?

68
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:34,807
<i>I… I… I think so. I'm here on business.</i>

69
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,473
- I understand, sir. Where are you?
<i>- Bro, doesn't your computer show that?</i>

70
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:42,765
- No, unfortunately it's not exact.
<i>- I need the fucking police!</i>

71
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,557
I need an address. Get out of your car.
Read a street sign or give me a landmark.

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,057
<i>I just told you I just got robbed!</i>
<i>I'm not leaving my fucking car!</i>

73
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,515
{\an8}- What happened, sir?
<i>- What…</i>

74
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,849
{\an8}<i>A woman pulled a knife</i>
<i>and took my wallet and computer. Okay?</i>

75
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,057
<i>It has all my work.</i>

76
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:58,932
- And did this just happen?
<i>- Yes.</i>

77
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:03,099
- On the street?
<i>- </i><i>Yeah, no.</i>

78
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:06,307
<i>- In my fucking car, man. I just told you.</i>
- How'd she get in your car?

79
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:09,807
<i>I… Does it matter?</i>

80
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,390
Um… Excuse me? I…

81
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:13,849
<i>She just jumped in, okay?</i>

82
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,807
Mm. "Jumped in."

83
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,473
<i>Get the fuck outta here!</i>
<i>Give me back my fucking computer.</i>

84
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:21,807
- Uh, do you see the Wells Fargo building?
<i>- I'm on the phone with the police.</i>

85
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,598
- Sir?
<i>- Yes, I'm right below it.</i>

86
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,390
You are on Bunker Hill
in the Financial District.

87
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:30,431
- I need your license plate number.
<i>- I don't know it. It's a rental.</i>

88
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:32,807
- Is there a door?
<i>- This is fucking crazy.</i>

89
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,765
<i>On the car? Yes, there's a door.</i>

90
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,974
Okay. Open it, get out,
and give me your plate number.

91
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:41,306
<i>I told you,
I'm not getting out of the car.</i>

92
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,515
Then it should be on the registration.
That should be in your glove compartment.

93
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:48,057
<i>Can you tell me how long it's gonna take?</i>

94
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,640
<i>Aren't you supposed
to fucking protect me, man?</i>

95
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,765
<i>- </i>Hmm.
<i>- Jesus Christ. Where on the registration?</i>

96
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,473
<i>Okay, I've got it.</i>

97
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,765
<i>"2DTN35S."</i>

98
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,723
- Make and model of the car, sir?
<i>- It's a blue 7 Series BMW.</i>

99
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,224
What does she look like?

100
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:12,141
{\an8}<i>She was young, tall,</i>
<i>dark skin, pink hair, in heels.</i>

101
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,015
Um…

102
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,723
- Race?
<i>- Mexican. Uh, Hispanic.</i>

103
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,932
Other details you can remember?

104
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,974
<i>She was, uh, voluptuous.</i>

105
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,015
<i>I mean, you know, she was...</i>

106
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,723
Hold the line.
I'm gonna get you a dispatcher.

107
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,182
A physical address.
That's perfect, thank you.

108
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,723
<i>LAPD Communications.
This is Sergeant Miller.</i>

109
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:41,557
This is Officer Baylor.
I have a robbery on Bunker Hill.

110
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
- Suspect is armed, and...
<i>- Oh, Officer Baylor!</i>

111
00:06:43,723 --> 00:06:46,849
<i>- Are you kidding me? It's Bill.</i>
- Wait, Sarge?

112
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,515
<i>Management rotation thing every week.</i>

113
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,390
- What? Sarge?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

114
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,723
What in the fuck
are you doing at dispatch?

115
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:57,849
<i>Equal latitude initiative. Every sergeant
mans the phones twice a month.</i>

116
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:00,099
Oh. That's a good use of resources.

117
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:05,682
<i>Yeah, political geniuses with ideas
about how to do our fucking job.</i>

118
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,306
<i>This phone duty is shit.</i>

119
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,099
You think so? I… I think it's fantastic.

120
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:13,141
<i>Tomorrow,
you're going to be back on the street.</i>

121
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,390
Can't wait.

122
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,431
<i>We better get on with this.
What do you got?</i>

123
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:25,057
I got a, um, Matthew Fontenot
robbed by a prostitute on Bunker Hill.

124
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,765
- Some Hispanic broad, pink hair.
<i>- </i><i>Lovely.</i>

125
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:32,640
Uh, plate number is California

126
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,849
<i>All right, roger.
We'll get somebody out there.</i>

127
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,057
Uh, you can let him sit
and stew in it for a bit.

128
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:39,598
<i>Lovely.</i>

129
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,974
Hey, Sarge. I heard about
that pinch at Harbor Division last week.

130
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,515
<i>Yeah, it was wild. Like 13 kilos.</i>

131
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,515
- AK's stash?
<i>- Yeah, we got him.</i>

132
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,807
- You bring Major Narcotics?
<i>- Yeah, of course.</i>

133
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,640
<i>Yeah, it was, uh, Chayney and Hunt.
They brought SWAT.</i>

134
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,682
Nice.

135
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,640
Everything okay with Rick?

136
00:07:58,265 --> 00:07:59,099
<i>Yeah.</i>

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,181
<i>Why wouldn't it be?</i>

138
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,431
- No reason.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

139
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,765
<i>- Yeah. He's good.</i>
- Right.

140
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,348
<i>I'll get the unit en route.
Talk to you later.</i>

141
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:15,890
- Later, Sarge.
<i>- Bye.</i>

142
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,849
911 Emergency Operator 125.
What is the address of your emergency?

143
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:24,265
- See what he looked like?
- Hello?

144
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:27,140
- I'm back, sir.
<i>- </i><i>Jesus, finally!</i>

145
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,807
<i>Hey, I've got a wife, man.</i>

146
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,515
<i>She's an angry woman.
She's very strong physically.</i>

147
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,557
<i>She doesn't know. I'm just on business.</i>

148
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
- Officers are on their way, sir.
<i>- And…</i>

149
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,473
Try and settle down
until the officer arrives.

150
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,807
No. A steak knife duct-taped
to a broom handle is not…

151
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,348
Yes. In five minutes. Yes.

152
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,557
Sir, you still there?

153
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,348
Where are you right now?

154
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:57,890
And what is the address
of your emergency?

155
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:00,140
Can you read the street sign?

156
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:03,598
Okay, good. Is there a cross street?

157
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:04,890
Cross street.

158
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,181
{\an8}Okay. Did you get a look at the car, sir?

159
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:11,974
What color was the vehicle?

160
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:15,390
Sir, did you see the direction
the car was moving?

161
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:17,974
Okay, down Slauson. Okay, sir.

162
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,181
Please hold. Please… Please hold.

163
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:23,181
911 Emergency, Officer 136.
What is your emergency?

164
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:34,223
Can you have her try
and lie down and wait for help to arrive.

165
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,348
- Hey, can I take a quickie?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:18,932
<i>Hey, it's Jess.</i>
<i>You know what to do. Leave a message.</i>

167
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:24,098
I know that I'm not supposed to, um…

168
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,598
But if Paige is awake,
uh, could I say good night?

169
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,390
It would mean a lot.

170
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:35,056
Bye.

171
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,348
It's ringing! Jesus, man.

172
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,181
911. Emergency Operator 625.
What is the address of your emergency?

173
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,014
911. What is the address
of your emergency?

174
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,765
{\an8}Hello? Is this Emily?

175
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:39,306
<i>- </i><i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:50,931
Are you at 5800 Regis Street, Apartment 6?

179
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:55,098
<i>- Don't be afraid.</i>
- Have you been drinking?

180
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,515
<i>- </i><i>No, I haven't.</i>
- Why did you call us?

181
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,014
<i>- I just wanna talk to you.</i>
- Okay, I'm hanging up.

182
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:08,348
<i>I'm just out for a drive, sweetie, okay?</i>

183
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,807
<i>- </i><i>Come on. Come on now.</i>
- Who is that?

184
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,348
<i>- </i><i>Yes, I understand.</i>
- Is there someone with you?

185
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,473
<i>- </i><i>Okay, that's enough.</i>
- Emily?

186
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:21,140
Does the person you're with
know you called us?

187
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,098
<i>- </i><i>No.</i>
- Who do they think you called?

188
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,473
<i>Yes. Yes, sweetie.</i>

189
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,265
- Your child?
<i>- Yes.</i>

190
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,098
Okay, Emily, I'm gonna ask you
yes-or-no questions, okay?

191
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,056
You know the person you're with?

192
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,014
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

193
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,515
And do they have a weapon?

194
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:43,765
Emily, does the person
you're with have a weapon?

195
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,140
<i>I don't know.</i>

196
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:49,931
Have you been abducted?

197
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,181
<i>Yes.</i>

198
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,931
Okay.

199
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,098
Emily, try and keep calm.
We need to figure out where you are.

200
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,431
Right, I show that
you're outside city limits.

201
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:05,723
Try and stay calm. Keep pretending
like you're talking to your child.

202
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,390
Talk to me like I'm your child.

203
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,306
<i>Um, Mommy's gonna be
home soon, okay, sweetie?</i>

204
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,223
Good. Are you on the freeway?

205
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,306
<i>- Yes.</i>
- The I-10?

206
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,598
<i>- Yes.</i>
- West?

207
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,265
<i>Come. Come on now.</i>

208
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:22,807
- Toward the beach?
<i>- </i><i>No.</i>

209
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:23,973
Do you see fire?

210
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:25,973
<i>Yes.</i>

211
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,807
When you look out your window,
is it on your left or right?

212
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:30,640
<i>- </i><i>Yes.</i>
- Your left?

213
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:33,515
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay, you're going east.

214
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,056
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay.

215
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
<i>Hey, give me the phone.</i>

216
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:42,056
Stay on the phone with me, Emily.
Say your child's upset.

217
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,390
<i>- She's upset. She's upset.</i>
- I have to put you on hold.

218
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:48,723
<i>No. No!</i>

219
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:52,056
I have to. Hold the line.
Act like you're comforting your child.

220
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,056
Come on, Emily.

221
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:59,473
<i>Don't be upset. I'll be home soon.</i>

222
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:01,140
Good. I'll be right back.

223
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,223
Fucking pick up.

224
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,098
<i>California Highway Patrol.</i>

225
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:13,223
This is Officer Joe Baylor.
LAPD Communications.

226
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,848
I have a woman who's been abducted.

227
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:19,598
She's traveling in a vehicle somewhere
eastbound on the I-10, east to downtown.

228
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:22,056
- You have any units available?
<i>- I'll check.</i>

229
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,557
Find one? Hello?

230
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,723
<i>- I have some nearby.</i>
- Then send them east.

231
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:34,515
<i>You have a plate number?</i>

232
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:38,223
No, but the woman will tell me when
she sees the officers pass. Hold the line.

233
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:42,181
- <i>Okay, sweetie.</i>
- Emily, I'm back.

234
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,557
CHP is looking for you.
When they pass you, you tell me.

235
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,056
- I'll have them pull you over, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

236
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,431
- Okay, let's wait, Emily. Okay?
<i>- Yes.</i>

237
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:53,306
They'll be there soon.

238
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:56,056
<i>Yes, yes, sweetie.</i>

239
00:14:58,848 --> 00:14:59,723
Shit.

240
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,056
<i>What?</i>

241
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:04,431
- Emily.
<i>- What?</i>

242
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:08,014
Emily. Emily, act like
you're comforting your child, okay?

243
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:11,181
<i>Mommy's gonna be home soon,</i>
<i>okay, sweetie?</i>

244
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,265
Tell her to go to… Tell her to go to bed.

245
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,598
<i>It's bedtime, sweetie.</i>

246
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:17,515
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

247
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:23,598
<i>- It's bedtime, sweetie.</i>
- There you go. Come on. Yeah. Good.

248
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:26,348
Just keep it up.
Keep it up. We're on our way.

249
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,473
<i>You just leave the light on, okay?</i>

250
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,140
<i>Come on. That's enough.</i>

251
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:35,722
<i>Give me the phone. Let me talk to her.</i>

252
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,848
She only wants to talk to you.
Tell him that.

253
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:40,140
- She only wants to talk to you.
<i>- Give me the phone.</i>

254
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:42,306
<i>She only wants to talk to me.</i>

255
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,098
<i>She doesn't want to talk to you.
I'm sorry.</i>

256
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:48,557
I need the color of the car.
When I say the right one, say it's fine.

257
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,473
Red, blue, black, white...

258
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:54,931
<i>- It's fine.</i>
- White?

259
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,806
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Is it a car?

260
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:02,140
{\an8}<i>- No.</i>

261
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,306
<i>- Van.</i>
<i>- </i><i>What?</i>

262
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,348
No, just yes-or-no answers, Emily.

263
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,390
<i>- What was that?</i>
<i>- </i><i>Sorry, I have to hang up.</i>

264
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:11,056
- Emily. Don't hang up.
<i>- I have to hang up.</i>

265
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,265
- Put the phone on the floor, in a pock...
<i>- Who're you talking to?</i>

266
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,848
{\an8}Anywhere he can't see it.
Keep it on so we can track you.

267
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:18,515
{\an8}If you can't, call me back.

268
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:20,681
- Joe. I'll be waiting.
<i>- </i><i>I have to hang up.</i>

269
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:22,431
Do you hear me?
I'll be waiting. My name is…

270
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,931
Fuck!

271
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,931
It's Joe. I lost her.
She exited city limits.

272
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:31,931
You have air support available?

273
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:34,348
<i>Air support</i>
<i>is grounded due to fire weather.</i>

274
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:36,348
<i>High winds, heavy smoke, no visibility.</i>

275
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,681
Have the officer
call me on the inside line.

276
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,390
<i>- What are you trying to do...</i>
- Just have him call me!

277
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:44,722
God damn it.

278
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,223
<i>Stand by.</i>

279
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:03,014
This is Officer Joe Baylor,
LAPD Communications.

280
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:05,806
<i>This is Officer Rodriguez with CHP.
I was told to call you.</i>

281
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:09,223
- What is your location?
<i>- We're I-10 eastbound in the Fontana area.</i>

282
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:10,973

283
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,056
<i>- What are we looking for?</i>
- A white van.

284
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:16,515
<i>- Sorry, say again?</i>
- A white van.

285
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,597
<i>- They're looking for a white van.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

286
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,098
- <i>There's a van just ahead.</i>
- What color?

287
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:25,848
<i>Can't see yet.
There's wind and smoke everywhere.</i>

288
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:28,764
- Pull up next to them.
<i>- Don't tell me what to fucking do.</i>

289
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,431
<i>- Okay, that must be him, right?</i>
<i>- </i><i>Man, so much smoke.</i>

290
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,390
<i>He's turning off.</i>
<i>He must've seen us.</i>

291
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,306
- Pull up next to him.
<i>- Can't. He took the exit.</i>

292
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,639
- Pull up next to him.
<i>- Can't.</i>

293
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:40,848
Fucking follow him!

294
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,889
<i>- </i><i>There he is.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Okay.</i>

295
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:50,722
<i>- Okay, he's pulling over.</i>
- Is it white?

296
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:53,181
<i>Can't see through all the dust.</i>

297
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,056
<i>- Is he armed?</i>
- I don't know. It's possible.

298
00:17:57,806 --> 00:17:58,639
<i>10-4.</i>

299
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,431
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

300
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,473
Highway Patrol!
Let me see your hands!

301
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,931
- I didn't do anything.
- Where I can see 'em!

302
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:13,848
- Keep 'em on the wheel!
<i>- What'd I do?</i>

303
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,140
<i>Step out</i>
<i>of the vehicle. Step out!</i>

304
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,931
<i>Stop. Let me see your hands.
Let me see 'em!</i>

305
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:23,681
<i>I am. I put them up. They're up!</i>

306
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:25,473
<i>- </i><i>Any weapons?</i>
<i>- </i><i>No, man.</i>

307
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:32,556
- What are you carrying?
<i>- Officer, what's the matter?</i>

308
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:36,681
<i>Watch him.</i>
<i>Watch him, I got it.</i>

309
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:44,764
<i>Wrong van, LAPD. No woman.</i>

310
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,056
What?

311
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,223
Are you sure?

312
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:49,390
<i>Yes.</i>

313
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:51,848
Is it white?

314
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,639
<i>It's white or silver.
It's hard to see. The sky's on fire.</i>

315
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,514
<i>- </i><i>California Highway Patrol.</i>
- This is Joe. They stopped the wrong van.

316
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,556
<i>I'll advise all units.
What are we looking for?</i>

317
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:10,140
- A white van.
<i>- That's not enough.</i>

318
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:13,597
<i>- I have six patrol cars up here.</i>
- I know, I know. License plate.

319
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:16,806
All I have is a driver's license
and address, but I keep looking.

320
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,597
<i>Look for a plate number,
then I'll inform the officers.</i>

321
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:23,806
All right, I'll keep looking.
What about closing the freeway?

322
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:25,140
<i>Hold.</i>

323
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,098
<i>Watch commander says negative.
We don't have enough...</i>

324
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:49,306
Just fucking find a car
and block the freeway.

325
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:50,889
Come on!

326
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,390
<i>- We don't know where they're headed.</i>
- Quiet, Baylor!

327
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,973
<i>We've got officers dealing with
multiple fire-related incidents.</i>

328
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,265
Fucking fire.

329
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,597
<i>Look for a plate number
and I'll inform the...</i>

330
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:05,639
It's not me.

331
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,098
<i>Mommy?</i>

332
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:41,014
<i>- Mommy?</i>
- Uh, this is officer Joe Baylor, LAPD.

333
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,597
Is your mommy or daddy home?

334
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,472
<i>- No.</i>
- What's your name?

335
00:20:46,556 --> 00:20:48,848
- <i>Abby.</i>
- How old are you?

336
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,806
<i>- Six years and nine months.</i>
- Six years and nine months.

337
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:56,514
<i>- My brother's home too.</i>
- Good. Can I talk to him?

338
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,181
<i>He's a baby.</i>

339
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:04,597
Abby, what is your mommy's name?

340
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,764
{\an8}Is it Emily?

341
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,514
<i>- They're not here.</i>
- Who is not here?

342
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:12,514
<i>- Mommy and Daddy.</i>
- Where'd they go?

343
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:14,806
<i>They just left me.</i>

344
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,722
Does your daddy have a white van?

345
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,681
Does he have a big white car?

346
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:23,639
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

347
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:25,140
What's your daddy's name?

348
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:29,806
What's your mommy call your daddy?

349
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,014
<i>Henry. I call him Daddy.</i>

350
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:34,556
<i>He says I can call him anytime I want.</i>

351
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:39,389
Abby? Abby?

352
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,556
- Abby...
<i>- I call Daddy.</i>

353
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,056
What were the numbers you just pressed?

354
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:52,806
<i>213-100-72…</i>

355
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:58,472
Wait, 72-what?
Abby, can you say those numbers again?

356
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:06,639
<i>213-100-7200. </i>

357
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,347
That's good. That's good.

358
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:14,181
Oh…

359
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,764
Henry Fisher. Perfect.

360
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:21,639
<i>Daddy helped me remember.
He showed me the numbers.</i>

361
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:24,472
{\an8}That's good. You're very smart.
Do you know that?

362
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:26,931
{\an8}<i>Uh-huh.</i>

363
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,098
{\an8}Plate number.

364
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
Does your daddy live with you, Abby?

365
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,181
<i>I go there.</i>

366
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:40,764
<i>- I… I want Mommy.</i>
- Abby.

367
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:44,140
<i>I want my mommy.</i>

368
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,347
Abby. Abby, don't cry.

369
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:50,347
Abby?

370
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,098
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

371
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:56,639
<i>The knife scared Oliver.</i>

372
00:22:58,514 --> 00:22:59,514
What?

373
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:04,264
<i>Daddy yelled at Mommy. She was crying.</i>

374
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,514
- Is Oliver your little brother's name?
<i>- Yes.</i>

375
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,056
And your daddy had a knife?

376
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,347
<i>I want Mommy.</i>

377
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,681
I know. I just talked to your mommy.
She's gonna be okay.

378
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,389
<i>- Do you promise?</i>
- I pro… I promise.

379
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:23,597
I promise. Okay?

380
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:26,597
Abby, we're the police.

381
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,098
- Do you know who the police are?
<i>- Yes.</i>

382
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:30,264
We're protectors.

383
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
<i>No.</i>

384
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,639
We protect people that need help.

385
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:42,430
<i>You hurt people. You took my daddy away.</i>

386
00:23:48,556 --> 00:23:49,931
<i>Where's my mommy?</i>

387
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,973
I'm gonna find your mommy.

388
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,305
I'm gonna bring her back
to you and your little brother.

389
00:23:58,098 --> 00:23:59,264
You want me to do that?

390
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,722
<i>- I want Mommy.</i>
- I know.

391
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,722
I get scared of being alone too.

392
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,389
You know what I do when I'm lonely?
I turn on the TV, and I have company.

393
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:14,931
Why don't you go do that?

394
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:19,140
<i>It's broken.</i>

395
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,806
Why don't you go sit
with your little brother?

396
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:29,222
<i>- He's sleeping.</i>
- It's okay. Just go in there.

397
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,347
<i>Dad said don't wake him up.</i>

398
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,931
You won't wake him up
if you're very, very quiet.

399
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,264
In the meantime,

400
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:40,056
I'm gonna send some officers over there
to look after you and Oliver, okay?

401
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:43,597
<i>I don't wanna talk anymore. I want Mommy.</i>

402
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:48,514
Someone's going to be with you soon.
If you need help, then call 911.

403
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:50,514
Can you say that for me?

404
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:55,180
<i>911.</i>

405
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:58,139
You press those numbers,
just like you call your daddy.

406
00:24:58,222 --> 00:24:59,597
<i>- 911.</i>
- That's right.

407
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,806
And my name is Joe. Can you say that?

408
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:06,597
<i>911. Joe.</i>

409
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,556
Good. Good girl, Abby.

410
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,014
<i>Okay, bye-bye.</i>

411
00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:21,514
What's going on?

412
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:25,430
What the… Mind your own fucking business.

413
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:34,222
Has anyone gotten a call
from Emily Lighton?

414
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:36,139
What's going on, Baylor? What do you need?

415
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:38,722
Just… have you gotten
a call from an Emily Lighton?

416
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,097
- Well, how about you, Manny?
- No.

417
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:53,848
<i>- </i><i>California Highway Patrol.</i>
- It's Joe.

418
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:58,305
{\an8}Plate number is California
two-Frank-Tom-David-twelve-King.

419
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:03,639
<i>Two-Frank-Tom-David-twelve-King.
I'll pass it on.</i>

420
00:26:03,722 --> 00:26:06,180
She's with her ex.
Henry Fisher. He took her.

421
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:09,889
<i>- 10-4.</i>
<i>- </i>The suspect has a knife.

422
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:13,222
<i>- I'll pass it on.</i>
- And a history of assault.

423
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:15,305
<i>I'll relay the plate number.</i>

424
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:17,556
Is there a unit you can send to her house?

425
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:21,973
<i>- I have to relay the plate now.</i>
- Right, but what's your plan?

426
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,055
<i>- To wait until they find the van?</i>
- Yeah, but you need a plan.

427
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:27,389
<i>- Joe.</i>
- There's a little girl...

428
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:30,973
<i>The quicker they get the plate number,
the faster we'll find them, right?</i>

429
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,430
No, no, no. Listen.

430
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:35,014
- You have to make sure...
<i>- Thanks for the plate number.</i>

431
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:37,806
Listen, I was thinking
that if you could send a car...

432
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,222
<i>No, you listen.</i>

433
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:42,639
<i>Listen!</i>
<i>I am up to my ass in calls.</i>

434
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:46,014
<i>Wait for her to call back.
Do your job, and I'll do mine. Okay?</i>

435
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:50,472
<i>Okay?</i>

436
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:54,472
Yeah.

437
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:58,681
<i>Good.</i>

438
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,722
By the way, I...

439
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,889
16-Adam-71. 16-Adam-71.

440

<i>16-Adam-71, roger.</i>

444
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:28,013
<i>You can show us en route

445
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,180
16...

446
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,180
Shit.

447
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,264
Jess?

448
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:42,681
<i>Joe, I want you to be able</i>
<i>to tell your side. It runs tomorrow.</i>

449
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,764
- Who is this?
<i>- I just have a few questions.</i>

450
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:45,681
Who is this?

451
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,556
<i>Katherine Harbor</i>
<i>from the</i> Los Angeles Times.

452
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:50,097
- Katherine Harbor, stop calling me.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

453
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,264
Hey, Manny. Oh, it's…

454
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,514
Hey, is it cold in here?

455
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,681
Feels all right to me.

456
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:15,556
- Manny?
- Yeah?

457
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:19,139
I've been an asshole.

458
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,930
- Not just today, but in general.
- Yes, you have.

459
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,681
We should get a beer sometime.

460
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,347
That sounds good, man.

461
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:41,389
Hey, I got a technical question.

462
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:42,305
Sure.

463
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,556
Uh, if I log out of my computer
and I log into another one,

464
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:47,347
will I still get the same calls?

465
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,472
Yes, they follow your login,
not your computer.

466
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,556
So your system can go anywhere you go.

467
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:57,055
Where you going? We're off in 15.

468
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:58,639
What about the beer?

469
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:34,180
<i>LAPD Communications.
This is Sergeant Miller.</i>

470
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:35,472
Hey, Sarge. It's Joe.

471
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:39,097
<i>Hey. Christ!</i>
<i>Do you ever go home?</i>

472
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,472
Am I interrupting something?

473
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:44,139
<i>No, God, no.
This is more boring than taking a shit.</i>

474
00:29:44,222 --> 00:29:45,556
Not if you're constipated.

475
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:47,888
<i>Well, yeah, that's true.</i>

476
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:49,389
You got a sec?

477
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:53,013
<i>Sure, man, it's calm down here. What's up?</i>

478
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:55,472
I need you to do me a favor.

479
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:58,055
<i>Sure thing. What do you need?</i>

480
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:01,556
{\an8}Could you send a car over
to 5800 Regis Street, Apartment 6?

481
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:04,347
{\an8}- It's urgent.
<i>- All right. Yeah, you got it. Why?</i>

482
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,013
I'm working a convicted felon,
kidnapped his ex-wife,

483
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,930
left two kids at the mother's house.

484
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:10,847
I need someone to send a unit over there.

485
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,639
<i>Okay, uh, how do you know
the kids are in there?</i>

486
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,180
I spoke to a girl, Abby.

487
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,264
<i>All right, and are the parents home?</i>

488
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:22,556
No. He took her and they're mobile
somewhere east of the city.

489
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,930
<i>- And did you talk to CHP?</i>
- Yes. But CHP is looking for the vehicle.

490
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:29,013
Sarge, look…

491
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,222
…they don't live together

492
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,472
and both of their residences
are in our jurisdiction,

493
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:36,222
so I need you to send
a unit over to the mother's house.

494
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:38,347
And I need you
to send another unit…

495
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,097
over to his house.

496
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,430
<i>Well, is there anyone at his house?</i>

497
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:47,013
I think he lives alone, but there might be
clues to where they're going over at his.

498
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,180
<i>- Mm-hmm. I don't know, Joe.</i>
- We need to hurry.

499
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:53,556
Get a unit to the mother's house
and one to his.

500
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:55,556
Kick his fucking door in if you have to.

501
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:00,264
<i>- Hmm. What… What was that?</i>
- Kick his fucking door in.

502
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:04,097
<i>Joe, excuse me?</i>

503
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,139
I talked to a terrified six-year-old girl,

504
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:08,639
and I promised her
that her mother would come home.

505
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:12,055
<i>I'm assuming that
there's no warrant for his residence.</i>

506
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:16,347
<i>So I'm gonna send someone
to the mother's house to check on the kid.</i>

507
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,805
No. I need you
to send a unit over to his house,

508
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:22,389
and I need you
to send a unit over to her house.

509
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,847
<i>- Joe, it's too much...</i>
- No, God damn it, Bill!

510
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,347
There is a scared little girl
whose mother has been abducted.

511
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,805
<i>That's enough! It's enough!
What are you trying to do?</i>

512
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:34,888
<i>You are in enough trouble already.</i>

513
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:37,222
<i>I will send a car to the mother's house,</i>

514
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:40,264
<i>but I'm not gonna have
anyone kicking in any fucking doors.</i>

515
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:43,139
<i>It's not your job.</i>

516
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:47,763
- I know that.
<i>- Yeah, well, apparently you don't.</i>

517
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,514
<i>Does this have
anything to do with tomorrow?</i>

518
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:55,805
What? No. I'm just trying to…

519
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:59,347
<i>- You want to talk to a new psychologist?</i>
- I'm just trying to help.

520
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,055
<i>- Do you need to do that?</i>
- No.

521
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:04,013
<i>I mean, I know
you didn't get along with the last one.</i>

522
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:05,013
No. I'm fine.

523
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:06,472
<i>- What's that?</i>
- No, I'm fine.

524
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,681
<i>Okay. All right.
So then, when are you off?</i>

525
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:13,430
I don't know. Uh, ten minutes.

526
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,847
<i>Okay, good.
You're gonna go to court tomorrow.</i>

527
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:22,847
<i>Afterwards, you'll be back on the street,
and you'll be off the phone.</i>

528
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,639
<i>- That's what you want, isn't it?</i>
- Yeah.

529
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:33,264
<i>- Isn't it, Joe?</i>
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

530
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:38,305
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

531
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:42,972
<i>- Send my love to Jess.</i>
- She's not here.

532
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,597
<i>When you get home.</i>

533
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,305
<i>- I'll talk to you later.</i>
- Yeah.

534
00:33:06,597 --> 00:33:09,888
<i>This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…</i>

535
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:12,430
<i>Stop it.</i>

536
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:15,680
<i>Leave me a message,
call later, or send a text.</i>

537
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:32,930
<i>- </i><i>California Highway...</i>
- It's Joe. Find the van?

538
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,638
<i>No, not yet.</i>

539
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,013
<i>Why are you calling? You have an update?</i>

540
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,763
No.

541
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Jess?

542
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,055
Hello? Hello? Are you…

543
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:31,847
I… I wake you up?

544
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:36,013
<i>You gotta stop doing this, Joe.</i>

545
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,805
- You're up late.
<i>- Come on.</i>

546
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:46,472
<i>We've been separated for six months now.
I'm not gonna keep doing this with you.</i>

547
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:48,389
I just wanted to say good night to Paige.

548
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,305
<i>Okay. Well, she's asleep, Joe.</i>

549
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,055
Well, I was thinking about her.

550
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:57,680
<i>It's two o'clock in the morning.</i>

551
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:02,721
<i>Listen to me, Joe.</i>

552
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:05,721
<i>You can't keep doing this.</i>

553
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,222
<i>Okay? It's confusing to her.
Don't you get that?</i>

554
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:11,555
<i>- We agreed on times...</i>
- I want to talk to my daughter.

555
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:13,180
<i>- Paige needs rules.</i>
<i>- </i>I don't und...

556
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:15,264
<i>- Do you get that, Joe?</i>
- Come on, Jess.

557
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,055
<i>Because it's like, you keep doing
whatever you want time after time.</i>

558
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:22,097
<i>You don't even give a shit
about what's best for anyone else.</i>

559
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,139
All right. Jesus Christ.

560
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:29,472
<i>Jesus Christ. Okay.</i>
<i>Know what? I'm not doing this with you.</i>

561
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:33,264
No, Jess, just hold on. Hold on.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Just wait.

562
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:41,180
How was, uh, um… that job interview?

563
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:45,055
The, uh… the…
the one at the, uh, that art place?

564
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,555
<i>It's next week.</i>

565
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,013
Oh.

566
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:54,638
<i>Oh.</i>

567
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:01,097
Look, I'm just… I'm, like…

568
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,555
I'm, like, losing, uh, track of time.

569
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,930
I just, like…
I just can't sleep in that Airbnb.

570
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,638
And I just keep… Watch too much TV.

571
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:17,305
<i>Yeah.</i>

572
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,972
<i>Okay, Joe, uh…</i>

573
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:26,555
<i>Look, I'm gonna</i>
<i>go back to sleep, okay?</i>

574
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:27,471
Wait.

575
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:28,888
<i>- Just try to…</i>
- Wait. Have<i>…</i>

576
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,139
Have you, uh…
Did you talk to Vikki about<i>…</i> about Rick?

577
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:35,264
<i>- Jesus, please. Please, Joe.</i>
- Come on.

578
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:37,180
<i>You said you wouldn't do this to me.</i>

579
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,139
<i>God.</i>

580
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,596
<i>Uh, yeah, Vikki said that there were…</i>

581
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,429
<i>federal officers over there the other day,
offering him something…</i>

582
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:55,638
<i>Maybe. I mean, I don't know. Joe, please.</i>

583
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:00,638
Were they over at our house?

584
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:04,305
<i>Stop. I'm not… I'm not doing this, Joe.</i>

585
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,763
Why did you just call me? Tell me that.

586
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:17,264
- They weren't over at our house?
<i>- No. Nobody came to our house, all right?</i>

587
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:19,596
<i>Okay?</i>

588
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,347
Are you coming tomorrow?

589
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:27,888
<i>I don't really think
that's such a good idea.</i>

590
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:32,139
'Cause you know it would look really good
to have the wife there, you know?

591
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:35,264
<i>Right. Yeah. Okay.</i>

592
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,180
<i>- I'm gonna go, Joe.</i>
- What did I… What did I say?

593
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:41,471
<i>- I'm hanging up.</i>
- Why you got to be… What...

594
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:43,347
<i>- Good luck tomorrow.</i>
- Jess.

595
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,638
- Yes?
<i>- </i><i>Barrakuda now!</i>

596
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:22,305
<i>- </i><i>Let's just go.</i>
<i>- </i><i>The doorman just attacked us.</i>

597
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:24,638
<i>- Get the police down here now!</i>
- Where are you?

598
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:27,139
<i>At the fucking Barrakuda! I told you!</i>

599
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,805
- I need an address.
<i>- Hey! Get away from him.</i>

600
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Sir, are you in the Valley?

601
00:38:31,763 --> 00:38:32,972
<i>Get away from him!</i>

602
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:35,222
<i>- Fuck this. I'll figure it out.</i>
- No.

603
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:38,388
- You need to let the police come there...
<i>- Fuck you! Forget it.</i>

604
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:39,805
What, fuck me?

605
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,763
- Fuck me?
<i>- Yeah, fuck you! Go to hell!</i>

606
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,388
- Yeah, fuck you!
<i>- Go to hell!</i>

607
00:39:33,346 --> 00:39:34,346
Henry.

608
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,180
<i>Who is this?</i>

609
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:43,180
This is officer Joe Baylor, LAPD.
Sorry to call so late.

610
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:45,429
You know your daughter
and son are home alone?

611
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,763
<i>My wife and I are separated.
We're separated.</i>

612
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,471
Do you know where your wife is?

613
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,513
<i>No.</i>

614
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,805
When was the last time
you saw or talked to her?

615
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:58,555
<i>I don't know.</i>

616
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:01,721
Well, don't you think you should
go check in on your children?

617
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:05,888
<i>I can't do that right now.</i>

618
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:08,847
What? Well, are you busy with something?

619
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:11,180
<i>Yeah.</i>

620
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,180
I know Emily is with you.

621
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:21,972
<i>You don't know shit.</i>

622
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:24,388
Where are you going?

623
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:29,388
<i>- What?</i>
- Where are you going?

624
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,471
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

625
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,680
Well, I know you've been to LAC, huh?

626
00:40:36,555 --> 00:40:38,388
I know you've done time at LAC, huh?

627
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:40,221
<i>- What?</i>
- You want to fucking do more?

628
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,263
- Huh? You wanna do more?
<i>- Uh…</i>

629
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:52,304
<i>- This is Henry.</i>
- Fuck. Fuck!

630
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,972
<i>- What's up, partner?</i>
- Everything all right?

631
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:20,972
<i>- Yeah. Something wrong?</i>
- Where are you?

632
00:41:22,388 --> 00:41:24,388
<i>At the station. I just got off duty.</i>

633
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:26,805
<i>Bueno.</i> Do me a favor.

634
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:28,429
<i>Sure. What is it?</i>

635
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:30,847
- Is your car there?
<i>- At the station?</i>

636
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,097
I need you to go to Foothill.
I'll explain to you when you get there.

637
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:35,972
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Rick?

638
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,596
You're not at the station, are you?

639
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

640
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:52,263
You don't sound like you.
You sound strange.

641
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,263
Have you been drinking?

642
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,179
<i>I'm not strange.</i>

643
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,972
- You haven't been drinking, have you?
<i>- Nope.</i>

644
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:07,471
<i>Joe…</i>

645
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:09,429
You don't drink, Rick.

646
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,263
- You don't drink.
<i>- I know.</i>

647
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:15,263
<i>How many times are you gonna say that?</i>

648
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:19,888
- You're my witness tomorrow.
<i>- I know. I know.</i>

649
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:22,388
I can't have
you coming to courthouse hungover.

650
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:23,596
<i>No, of course not.</i>

651
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:32,471
<i>- It's just that…</i>
- What?

652
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,930
<i>Just… I'm fucking afraid.</i>

653
00:42:41,555 --> 00:42:46,221
<i>This isn't gonna go our way.
I had the feds at my house this morning.</i>

654
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:47,304
<i>You understand?</i>

655
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:50,429
<i>I'm afraid I might say the wrong thing.</i>

656
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,930
- Hey, hey, I know, you...
<i>- Joe, I'm afraid it...</i>

657
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:57,013
You're not gonna say the wrong thing.

658
00:42:57,805 --> 00:43:01,138
- After tomorrow, we'll be back at it.
<i>- Joe?</i>

659
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:05,930
<i>I'm tired of this. It's been eight months.</i>

660
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:09,179
I know. Me too, homie. I know.

661
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:13,930
- I know.
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

662
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:28,888
How much have you had to drink?

663
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:32,888
<i>I'm sorry. Just one or two.</i>

664
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:35,680
All right, so you can still drive.
I need you to go…

665
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:42,721
{\an8}to 1605 North Tujunga
in Foothill, all right?

666
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:45,596
A Henry Fisher lives there, all right?

667
00:43:48,096 --> 00:43:49,096
Baylor.

668
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,221
- You got it?
<i>- Got it.</i>

669
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:54,680
Okay. All right, just drive safe.
All right, and hurry.

670
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,346
What, am I not
supposed to talk in here either?

671
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,930
No, in here's fine. You could do something
about your attitude, though.

672
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:08,388
What?

673
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:11,138
You got a phone call, a little girl.

674
00:44:11,221 --> 00:44:12,930
- Abby?
- She didn't tell me her name.

675
00:44:13,012 --> 00:44:16,221
- Do you want me to put her through?
- Yeah, put her through. Yes!

676
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:18,346
You want to try that again?

677
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:20,805
- Sorry.
- Okay.

678
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:30,596
Abby?

679
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,888
{\an8}<i>I'm not supposed to open the door.</i>

680
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,346
It's okay. All right? They're my friends.

681
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:38,429
- It's the police. You can let them in.
<i>- Mommy said not to.</i>

682
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:39,805
It's okay.

683
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:42,138
They're gonna stay with you
until your mommy comes home.

684
00:44:43,596 --> 00:44:46,471
<i>- Hi, my name is Tim. This is Nadia.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Hi.</i>

685
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:48,680
<i>We're police officers.</i>

686
00:44:48,763 --> 00:44:50,596
<i>- Is that for me?</i>
<i>- </i><i>Yes.</i>

687
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:54,304
<i>Hello, Officer Tim Geraci.</i>

688
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:57,012
This is officer Joe Baylor,
LAPD Communications.

689
00:44:57,513 --> 00:44:59,680
<i>Hi. We're checking in on two kids?</i>

690
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,596
Yes. Abby and her little brother.

691
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,138
I have to keep the line open
'cause her mother might call.

692
00:45:04,221 --> 00:45:07,054
- I think probably you can find...
<i>- </i><i>Did you hurt yourself, Abby?</i>

693
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:08,847
<i>It's not mine.</i>

694
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:11,638
<i>She has blood</i>
<i>on her hands and shirt.</i>

695
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:13,888
What's going on?

696
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:18,471
Check on Oliver.

697
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:21,638
<i>Abby, do you know
where your little brother is?</i>

698
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:22,596
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

699
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,221
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>just wait here with Nadia, all right?</i>

700
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:26,555
<i>Wait here with me.</i>

701
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:29,138
<i>Oh, this place is a wreck.</i>

702
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:30,847
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Just find Oliver.

703
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:35,971
<i>- </i><i>Do you know where he is?</i>
- I don't know. Just look around.

704
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:38,388
<i>I'm in the kitchen right now, it's…</i>

705
00:45:41,763 --> 00:45:43,596
<i>- There's the bedroom.</i>
- You find him?

706
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,847
<i>This must be it.</i>

707
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:50,012
- Tim, are you there?
<i>- Hold on. Hold on.</i>

708
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:52,763
<i>There's bloodstains on the floor.</i>

709
00:45:53,388 --> 00:45:56,638
<i>Oh my God!
LAPD, we need medical immediately.</i>

710
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,721
What's going on?

711
00:45:57,805 --> 00:46:00,179
<i>Oh. Oh!</i>

712
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:02,429
- Tim, what's going on?
<i>- </i><i>Oh my God!</i>

713
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:04,471
<i>Nadia, get in here! </i>

714
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,513
- Tim?
<i>- </i><i>All right, I'm coming!</i>

715
00:46:07,054 --> 00:46:08,179
Are you there?

716
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:10,346
<i>Just check</i>
<i>if he's breathing, all right?</i>

717
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:12,887
<i>- </i><i>All right, I'm on it.</i>
- What the fuck is going on?

718
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,596
- What's wrong with you?
<i>- </i><i>Don't let her in!</i>

719
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,721
<i>- </i><i>I don't think he's breathing.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Stay outside!</i>

720
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:19,304
<i>- </i><i>Dad said don't wake him up.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Nadia, close the door.</i>

721
00:46:19,388 --> 00:46:20,887
<i>- </i><i>Get back.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Is he okay?</i>

722
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:23,304
- Tim?
<i>- </i><i>What's wrong with Oliver?</i>

723
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:24,929
<i>- </i><i>Stay with him.</i>
<i>- </i><i>On it.</i>

724
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:26,929
<i>Abby, just come with...</i>

725
00:46:27,012 --> 00:46:28,096
Yo, Tim? Tim?

726
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,929
Joe, shift is over.

727
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:35,471
Day watch is here. We're off.

728
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,304
Uh…

729
00:46:40,846 --> 00:46:42,971
I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.

730
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:53,346
Joe, is everything okay?

731
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:54,429
Yeah.

732
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:57,846
Well, look, um, good luck tomorrow, huh?

733
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:21,804
<i>Don't call me.</i>

734
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:23,513
I know what you did to the baby.

735
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:25,012
<i>Shh. Don't call me.</i>

736
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:28,388
Abby saw what you did to Oliver.
Are you gonna kill her now too?

737
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:29,887
<i>I told her not to go in there.</i>

738
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:32,680
<i>- She shouldn't have gone in there.</i>
- She's six years old!

739
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:35,012
What do you think she was gonna do?

740
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:37,887
She is covered in his blood.

741
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:41,804
Henry, this stops here, right now.

742
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:45,179
You stop the car, and you tell me
where you are. I will send help.

743
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:48,346
<i>- </i><i>I can't do that.</i>
- You have to.

744
00:47:49,846 --> 00:47:50,971
<i>What if I do…</i>

745
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,513
Yes?

746
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:57,721
<i>- What will happen?</i>
- To you? You go back to prison.

747
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:00,304
<i>Yeah, no, that can't happen.</i>

748
00:48:00,388 --> 00:48:02,680
That can't happen? That can't happen?

749
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:04,846
What do you want me to say?
That you're a victim?

750
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:09,012
Huh? You think you're a victim?
You're not a victim. Emily is a victim.

751
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:12,804
Oliver is a victim. Abby's a victim.
You're not a victim. You're a…

752
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:15,804
You should be fucking executed!

753
00:48:21,762 --> 00:48:23,388
<i>This is Henry, leave a message.</i>

754
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:26,929
<i>This is Henry, leave a...</i>

755
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,304
{\an8}- Rick.
<i>- </i><i>I'm at the address.</i>

756
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:34,221
{\an8}<i>Some courtyard apartments. Looks like</i>
<i>nobody's home. The lights are out.</i>

757
00:48:34,304 --> 00:48:35,221
{\an8}Kick the door in.

758
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:36,513
<i>- What?</i>
- Just trust me.

759
00:48:38,388 --> 00:48:40,263
<i>Stop fucking around. Tell me why I'm here.</i>

760
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:43,054
The man who lived there
killed one of his kids, a baby.

761
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,513
He abducted his ex-wife.
We need to know where they're going.

762
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:49,971
<i>How'd you get this?</i>

763
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:54,971
Answering a 911 call.

764
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:57,762
<i>Of course you did. Fucking shit magnet.</i>

765
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:02,555
<i>Hello. Hello? Police.</i>

766
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:05,138
<i>Hello, this is the police.</i>

767
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:08,304
- What's going on? Rick?
<i>- Shit!</i>

768
00:49:08,388 --> 00:49:11,138
Rick, what's up? Rick?

769
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:13,263
<i>Big fucking dog on a chain in the house.</i>

770
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:16,304
Fuck.

771
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,887
All right, you get in?

772
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:22,388
- You get in?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

773
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:23,804
- All right.
<i>- Door was open.</i>

774
00:49:23,887 --> 00:49:26,346
<i>- Yeah. He must have been in a hurry.</i>
- Look around.

775
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:32,804
<i>There's not much.</i>

776
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,513
<i>Place is practically empty.
There's a mattress, some toys, unopened.</i>

777
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:40,971
<i>There's something's else.</i>

778
00:49:41,054 --> 00:49:43,471
<i>A stack of letters on the floor,
an address book.</i>

779
00:49:44,638 --> 00:49:48,346
<i>Damn. A lot of bills.
DWP, parking ticket, parking ticket…</i>

780
00:49:49,346 --> 00:49:52,138
<i>- There's five parking violations.</i>
- What else?

781
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:57,096
<i>Come on. I can't, Joe.
There's so much shit here.</i>

782
00:49:57,179 --> 00:49:58,596
Rick, Rick, please.

783
00:50:00,555 --> 00:50:04,471
<i>It'll take me hours. Do you realize
how many letters and papers there are?</i>

784
00:50:04,555 --> 00:50:07,762
<i>- She'll be dead by the time I'm done.</i>
- What is that supposed to mean?

785
00:50:10,471 --> 00:50:12,679
<i>Nothing. Time is against us.</i>

786
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,012
Right. So get going.
All right? You got it?

787
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:16,388
<i>Yeah.</i>

788
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:24,971
Emily?

789
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:30,555
Emily, you listening? Do you hear me?

790
00:50:34,513 --> 00:50:36,179
- <i>Abby.</i>
- Okay.

791
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:37,929
<i>Hey, give me the phone.</i>

792
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:40,679
- Emily…
<i>- </i><i>Give me the phone.</i>

793
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:41,971
Is your seat belt on?

794
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:44,471
<i>No.</i>

795
00:50:44,555 --> 00:50:46,012
- Does Henry?
<i>- </i><i>Come on.</i>

796
00:50:47,346 --> 00:50:49,221
<i>- </i><i>No.</i>
- Put yours on.

797
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,471
<i>Come on. Give me the phone.</i>
<i>I need to talk to her. Now.</i>

798
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:53,595
Is it on?

799
00:50:55,304 --> 00:50:56,179
<i>Yes.</i>

800
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,762
Okay.

801
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,429
Now listen,

802
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:03,096
I need you to pull the handbrake hard.

803
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:06,346
Pull.

804
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:08,221
<i>No, no, no!</i>

805
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:22,012
- Emily?
<i>- This is Emily Lighton.</i>

806
00:51:22,096 --> 00:51:24,054
<i>I can't come to the phone right now, so…</i>

807
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,762
- Emily? What?
<i>- </i><i>I crashed my bike and hurt my knee.</i>

808
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:35,138
<i>- Uh, hello? I crashed...</i>
- I can't talk now. Call back later.

809
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,929
- Emily?
<i>- I crashed my bike and hurt my knee.</i>

810
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:43,554
Sir, I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.

811
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:45,429
<i>What was that? Are you kidding me?</i>

812
00:51:45,513 --> 00:51:47,720
When you call, you get the same operator.

813
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,221
- Just please call back later.
<i>- Excuse me? Just send an ambulance.</i>

814
00:51:51,304 --> 00:51:53,138
- What? For your knee?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

815
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:55,595
Call an Uber,
and don't bike drunk, asshole.

816
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:01,846
Emily?

817
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:04,471
<i>I did the thing</i>
<i>that you said, but it didn't work.</i>

818
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,887
<i>- I can't get out.</i>
- Okay. I know. You're headed toward…

819
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:08,637
You're headed towards San Bernardino.

820
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,054
- Do you know where?
<i>- I can't see anything.</i>

821
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:14,179
{\an8}<i>I don't want to get locked up.</i>

822
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:16,720
No, but where are you going?
I'll get you out of the car.

823
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:18,971
<i>I don't want to get locked up.</i>

824
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,637
- Emily.
<i>- I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.</i>

825
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,512
No, nobody's gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.

826
00:52:23,595 --> 00:52:26,595
- I have to put you on hold. Okay, Emily?
<i>- Please, help me.</i>

827
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,429
Emily, if I'm gonna help you…

828
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,929
- Just hold the line. I'll be right back.
<i>- Please.</i>

829
00:52:35,346 --> 00:52:37,429
<i>LAPD Communications,</i>
<i>Sergeant Miller.</i>

830
00:52:37,512 --> 00:52:38,388
It's Joe.

831
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,679
<i>- Joe, what? You're still at work?</i>
<i>- </i>Oh shit. Bill?

832
00:52:41,762 --> 00:52:44,470
- I meant to call CHP.
<i>- Didn't I tell you to go home?</i>

833
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:46,971
- No. I can't right now.
<i>- What the fuck, Joe?</i>

834
00:52:50,346 --> 00:52:52,012
<i>- California Highway Patrol.</i>
- It's Joe.

835
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:55,388
I have Emily on the other line.
She's in the back of the van.

836
00:52:56,012 --> 00:53:00,595
It looks like they're headed
somewhere near the 10 and the 210

837
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:01,929
towards San Bernardino.

838
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,012
<i>- No, I need a better location.</i>
<i>- </i>Shit!

839
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:06,929
Fuck, shit! They just…
It switched cell towers.

840
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:10,304
- I have her on the other line.
<i>- I told you, I need a better location.</i>

841
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:14,054
I'll get it. Just… Just…
Just send units up the 210 from the 10.

842
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:16,470
<i>- How will you get it?</i>
- I'll get her out of the car.

843
00:53:18,304 --> 00:53:20,054
- Emily?
<i>- Oh God. Please don't hang up.</i>

844
00:53:20,138 --> 00:53:23,346
- Emily, I'm back.
<i>- Please don't hang up.</i>

845
00:53:23,428 --> 00:53:24,887
I won't. All right.

846
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:27,971
<i>I just want to go home to my kids.</i>

847
00:53:28,054 --> 00:53:30,554
<i>- They shouldn't be alone.</i>
- All right, now just listen.

848
00:53:30,637 --> 00:53:33,846
<i>He put me in the back of the van
and I can't see anything.</i>

849
00:53:33,929 --> 00:53:37,263
- No. Emily, listen to me.
<i>- I don't know why he's doing this.</i>

850
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:40,221
Listen to my voice, Emily.
All right? I'm with you.

851
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,428
<i>- He's gonna lock me up.</i>
- You're not alone.

852
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,138
All right? Do you understand?

853
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,679
<i>I don't want to die. </i>

854
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:48,637
Okay…

855
00:53:51,221 --> 00:53:54,138
What does Henry do?
Why does Henry have a van?

856
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:58,012
<i>- I'm gonna die.</i>
- No, you're not. Emily. Emily...

857
00:53:58,096 --> 00:54:00,595
<i>- I'm gonna die.</i>
- Emily, take a deep breath.

858
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:04,929
Now, I'm gonna get you back to Abby,
but I need your help. All right?

859
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:09,221
I need you to find something in the van
to defend yourself with.

860
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,304
- Is there anything back there?
<i>- I can't see anything.</i>

861
00:54:12,387 --> 00:54:15,428
Just feel around you.
Use the flashlight on your phone.

862
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:21,595
<i>There's a cardboard box. A heavy box.</i>

863
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:25,138
<i>- Bricks.</i>
- Okay. Okay, good.

864
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,138
Good. Okay. Can you pick one up?

865
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:31,804
<i>I have one. I have one.</i>

866
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:33,804
Good. Okay, good. Okay.

867
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,387
Now, listen, Emily.

868
00:54:37,263 --> 00:54:40,720
When he stops the van
and he opens those doors,

869
00:54:40,804 --> 00:54:44,720
I want you to hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

870
00:54:44,804 --> 00:54:47,179
<i>- </i><i>I can't do that.</i>
- You understand?

871
00:54:47,263 --> 00:54:48,637
- You can.
<i>- I can't do that.</i>

872
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,138
- Emily?
<i>- Oh no.</i>

873
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,679
- Emily, you can.
<i>- I can't.</i>

874
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:55,804
Then you take his knife
and then you tell me where you are,

875
00:54:55,887 --> 00:54:57,179
and I will send help.

876
00:54:57,263 --> 00:54:58,179
<i>I can't.</i>

877
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,179
Yes, you can, Emily. Emily.

878
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:07,887
<i>- I don't know why he's doing this.</i>
- Emily. Emily, breathe. Emily, breathe.

879
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,470
Come on. Come on now.

880
00:55:09,554 --> 00:55:12,179
- Come on. Come on.
<i>- I'm gonna die.</i>

881
00:55:12,263 --> 00:55:15,054
Just like this. Just like this.

882
00:55:15,138 --> 00:55:17,304
Come on. Just like… Come on, Emily.

883
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,762
- Emily.
<i>- </i><i>I'm gonna die.</i>

884
00:55:20,846 --> 00:55:24,179
You're not. Emily, breathe with me.

885
00:55:34,303 --> 00:55:37,138
Breathe. Breathe, Emily. Breathe with me.

886
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:49,595
Emily, what's your favorite…
what's your favorite food?

887
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:55,096
Emily, what's your favorite food?

888
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,720
<i>Cherry…</i>

889
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,345
<i>cherry Slurpees.</i>

890
00:56:01,345 --> 00:56:04,846
Cherry Slurpees.
I don't know if that's a… a food.

891
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:09,096
What… What do you like
to do with your kids? Huh?

892
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:10,345
What's a nice thing…

893
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:13,554
Keep breathing with me, all right?

894
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,387
<i>- I like...</i>
- What do you like to do in your free time?

895
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:24,387
<i>I like to be with Abby</i>
<i>and with Oliver, but Henry… </i>

896
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,512
<i>Henry…</i>

897
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:29,303
What do you do with your kids, Emily?
What's a nice thing you do? Come on.

898
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:33,720
Come on.

899
00:56:37,846 --> 00:56:39,303
<i>We like the aquarium.</i>

900
00:56:41,096 --> 00:56:42,012
Where?

901
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:47,012
<i>San Pedro.</i>

902
00:56:48,512 --> 00:56:49,679
<i>Have you been there?</i>

903
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:55,138
No, I've always meant to,
uh, take my daughter there,

904
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,637
but we never had a chance to.

905
00:56:58,971 --> 00:57:02,470
Tell me about…
Tell me about the aquarium. Is it nice?

906
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:09,179
<i>Abby… Abby likes the turtles.</i>

907
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,887
<i>She doesn't even look</i>
<i>at the sharks. </i>

908
00:57:13,971 --> 00:57:16,345
What do…
What do you like? You like the sharks?

909
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,554
<i>I like all of them.</i>

910
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:27,971
<i>I usually walk behind Abby
with Oliver in the baby carriage,</i>

911
00:57:30,138 --> 00:57:32,054
<i>and then I just look</i>

912
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:34,512
<i>and feel.</i>

913
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:37,846
Feel what?

914
00:57:41,303 --> 00:57:43,470
<i>Seems so peaceful.</i>

915
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,303
What does?

916
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:53,637
<i>Under the water. Like…</i>

917
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,178
<i>Like quiet.</i>

918
00:57:58,012 --> 00:57:59,679
<i>Like being held.</i>

919
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:07,595
<i>No distractions.
Just water flowing around you.</i>

920
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:10,470
<i>Very quiet,</i>

921
00:58:11,345 --> 00:58:12,595
<i>like a big,</i>

922
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:16,262
<i>blue silence.</i>

923
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:19,929
Yeah.

924
00:58:26,387 --> 00:58:27,804
<i>I forgot your name.</i>

925
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:32,220
My name is Joe.

926
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:37,595
<i>I like you, Joe.</i>

927
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,971
I like you too, Emily.

928
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:48,345
<i>Would you like to come with us?</i>

929
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,178
I'd love to.

930
00:58:58,428 --> 00:58:59,470
<i>He's stopping.</i>

931
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:05,512
<i>- </i><i>I'm scared.</i>
- Okay. All right.

932
00:59:05,595 --> 00:59:08,762
- Take it easy, Emily. Just…
<i>- I'm scared!</i>

933
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:11,262
- Put your phone in your pocket.
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

934
00:59:11,345 --> 00:59:12,887
And when he opens those doors,

935
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:16,012
you take that brick and you hit him
in the head as hard as you can.

936
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,846
- He deserves it.
<i>- Oh God.</i>

937
00:59:19,262 --> 00:59:21,428
<i>- He deserves it.</i>
- That's right.

938
00:59:23,428 --> 00:59:24,887
Now put your phone away.

939
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,012
- Put in your pocket.
<i>- He was so angry.</i>

940
00:59:29,095 --> 00:59:31,053
- I know.
<i>- He was so angry.</i>

941
00:59:31,137 --> 00:59:34,012
I know. I know. Emily, put the phone away.

942
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:38,012
<i>- Oliver's fine. Oliver's fine.</i>
- Just put the phone away when he opens...

943
00:59:38,554 --> 00:59:41,095
<i>Oliver's fine. He isn't even crying now.</i>

944
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:42,929
What was that?

945
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:48,554
<i>The snakes.</i>

946
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,720
Snakes? What snakes?

947
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:55,220
<i>He was in so much pain.</i>

948
00:59:55,303 --> 00:59:58,846
<i>They were… in his stomach.</i>

949
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:02,178
<i>He kept crying
because he had snakes in his stomach.</i>

950
01:00:04,762 --> 01:00:06,345
<i>And I just took them out.</i>

951
01:00:11,512 --> 01:00:13,303
<i>I just took them out.</i>

952
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,512
Was it… you?

953
01:00:23,262 --> 01:00:28,220
<i>He's… He's not crying anymore.
He's much, so much better.</i>

954
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:34,512
<i>He's fine, isn't he? Joe? </i>

955
01:00:34,595 --> 01:00:38,011
<i>Joe? Please tell me he's fine.</i>

956
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:41,178
<i>Please just tell me, Joe.</i>

957
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,637
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

958
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,303
<i>He's gonna lock me up.</i>

959
01:00:45,053 --> 01:00:47,929
<i>Get away from me! Stop it!</i>

960
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,804
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

961
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,679
<i>Stop it!</i>

962
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:12,262
<i>Hello?</i>

963
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:14,679
<i>Hello? Are you there, Joe?</i>

964
01:01:16,178 --> 01:01:18,512
<i>I think there's something wrong
with my phone. Hang on.</i>

965
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,804
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah.

966
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:25,262
<i>I think I found something.</i>

967
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,595
<i>They went to court over custody.</i>

968
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:31,345
<i>Henry has letters from a lawyer.
Looks like he lost visitation rights.</i>

969
01:01:31,428 --> 01:01:34,428
<i>It's about his criminal record
and his sentences for assault.</i>

970
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:35,512
<i>No fucking wonder.</i>

971
01:01:38,053 --> 01:01:40,887
<i>Joe?</i>

972
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:43,387
<i>Joe?</i>

973
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:46,762
Yeah? Yeah?

974
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,220
<i>Sorry, I'll get to the point.</i>

975
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:54,720
<i>The only thing from San Bernardino are
unpaid bills from Patton State Hospital.</i>

976
01:01:54,804 --> 01:01:56,387
<i>Uh, she was a patient there.</i>

977
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:03,178
<i>Joe?</i>

978
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,720
<i>Patton State Psychiatric Treatment Center.
Does that help any?</i>

979
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,637
She doesn't want to be locked up.

980
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:13,345
<i>What was that?</i>

981
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:16,095
She doesn't want to be locked up.

982
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:20,011
- God. Shit.
<i>- You lost me there, brother.</i>

983
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:22,804
<i>Joe?</i>

984
01:02:50,262 --> 01:02:51,970
- Henry?
<i>- Hello?</i>

985
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:55,928
{\an8}Joe from LAPD.
Are you at… Are you at Patton?

986
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:57,804
- The State Hospital?
<i>- Oh. Yeah.</i>

987
01:02:58,512 --> 01:02:59,679
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

988
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,762
- Okay, uh, where is Emily?
<i>- God.</i>

989
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:10,762
<i>Uh, I don't know. I think she hit me.</i>

990
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,512
Okay, I'll send help.

991
01:03:12,595 --> 01:03:15,554
- Do you need an ambulance?
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

992
01:03:15,637 --> 01:03:17,595
<i>- No police.</i>
- Henry, I have to.

993
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:20,178
- I have to.
<i>- God, I haven't done anything, man.</i>

994
01:03:20,262 --> 01:03:21,178
<i>No.</i>

995
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,095
I know. I know.

996
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:27,679
Why didn't you tell me?

997
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:31,804
You should have just called the police
and let us take care of Emily.

998
01:03:33,428 --> 01:03:35,095
<i>- Why?</i>
- I wanna help her.

999
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:36,011
<i>Huh?</i>

1000
01:03:36,554 --> 01:03:39,303
<i>- You wanna help her? Fuck.</i>
- Yes, that is my job.

1001
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,512
<i>Let me tell you something. Nobody helps.</i>

1002
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:44,845
<i>We get doctors, lawyers, social workers.</i>

1003
01:03:44,928 --> 01:03:47,803
<i>Nobody helps, just fucking nobody.</i>

1004
01:03:47,886 --> 01:03:50,637
<i>You trying to tell me</i>
<i>a cop's gonna help me? </i>

1005
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,970
I'm trying to help.

1006
01:03:53,428 --> 01:03:57,679
<i>Oh yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you!</i>

1007
01:03:58,679 --> 01:03:59,886
<i>She killed my son.</i>

1008
01:04:00,886 --> 01:04:03,095
<i>Killed my son. My son.</i>

1009
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:06,178
<i>My son is dead.</i>

1010
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:27,262
<i>Last November</i>…

1011
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:29,303
<i>we, uh…</i>

1012
01:04:30,761 --> 01:04:32,512
<i>Discount ran out, man.</i>

1013
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:37,554
<i>We said we'd try,
that we'd try to do it without her meds.</i>

1014
01:04:37,637 --> 01:04:39,178
<i>Oh my God! Oh my God!</i>

1015
01:04:41,053 --> 01:04:45,761
<i>I couldn't pay for them,
you know, like, because I…</i>

1016
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:47,011
<i>Oh my God.</i>

1017
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,761
Henry? What are you doing?

1018
01:04:55,303 --> 01:04:58,679
<i>Oh my God, Abby.
I should never have left her.</i>

1019
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,637
No, no. Henry,
the police are with her. Hen… Hen…

1020
01:05:02,262 --> 01:05:07,719
Henry. Henry, I'm gonna
need you to try and calm down.

1021
01:05:09,428 --> 01:05:12,053
<i>She's just a little baby…
just a little baby girl.</i>

1022
01:05:12,137 --> 01:05:16,095
<i>I told her not to go in there.
Oh my God. I need to get Abby.</i>

1023
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,345
No, Henry. Henry, listen to me.

1024
01:05:19,428 --> 01:05:23,220
Henry, the police have her.
The police. She is safe. She is safe.

1025
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:25,679
She is fine. She is fine.

1026
01:05:25,761 --> 01:05:29,719
- Where is Emily? We have to find Emily.
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1027
01:05:29,803 --> 01:05:31,970
- Henry?
<i>- I don't know where she is.</i>

1028
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:35,637
Henry, do you think
that she could harm herself?

1029
01:05:36,137 --> 01:05:39,220
<i>I don't know.
I don't know. Listen. Just listen.</i>

1030
01:05:40,178 --> 01:05:42,262
<i>Listen to me. Okay? Listen.</i>

1031
01:05:42,928 --> 01:05:46,678
<i>She has no idea what she's done.</i>

1032
01:05:46,761 --> 01:05:50,428
<i>She… she thinks… Oh my God.</i>

1033
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:53,345
<i>She thinks that she helped Oliver.</i>

1034
01:05:54,345 --> 01:05:56,845
<i>I didn't have
the heart to tell her that she…</i>

1035
01:05:56,928 --> 01:05:59,761
<i>Oh God, she wasn't always like this.</i>

1036
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,345
<i>She's just sick.</i>

1037
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:07,719
<i>And I just…
I needed to help her. She's just…</i>

1038
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:10,470
Henry?

1039
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:27,512
<i>This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…</i>

1040
01:06:27,595 --> 01:06:28,845
No.

1041
01:06:46,512 --> 01:06:49,470
Joe? Joe?

1042
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:54,303
We have a caller who wants to talk to you.

1043
01:06:54,387 --> 01:06:55,470
What?

1044
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:58,428
A caller wants to talk to you.
She says you talked before.

1045
01:06:58,512 --> 01:07:00,803
- Her name is Emily...
- No. What? Where is she?

1046
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:03,137
Yes, now! Now, man!

1047
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,303
- Now!
- What happened here?

1048
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:07,719
- Just put her through!
- I'll patch her through.

1049
01:07:13,428 --> 01:07:15,262
Emily?

1050
01:07:15,345 --> 01:07:16,845
<i>Is that you, Joe?</i>

1051
01:07:16,928 --> 01:07:18,303
Yes, Emily, I'm here.

1052
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:23,970
Where are you?

1053
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:27,303
<i>I'm gonna go find Oliver and Abby.</i>

1054
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,387
<i>I'm gonna take them to the aquarium.</i>

1055
01:07:30,886 --> 01:07:34,262
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1056
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:35,970
<i>We'll show you the turtles.</i>

1057
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:39,554
<i>Oliver loves the turtles.</i>

1058
01:07:39,636 --> 01:07:40,845
No, you're not…

1059
01:07:42,303 --> 01:07:43,761
You're not gonna find Oliver.

1060
01:07:45,345 --> 01:07:46,554
Oliver's not there.

1061
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,678
Emily. Emily, I need you…

1062
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:52,470
<i>- He's better now.</i>
- Emily, I need you to look around you.

1063
01:07:52,553 --> 01:07:55,470
Okay? Where are you?
Where are you? I hear cars.

1064
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:58,137
Uh… Uh… Can you see what's around you?

1065
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:01,803

<i>Cars.</i>

1070
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:12,553
<i>What is this?</i>

1071
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:14,761
<i>I…</i>

1072

<i>- I have blood on my hands and my shirt.</i>
- Emily.

1073
01:08:21,428 --> 01:08:24,845
<i>- Where? I have blood on my hands.</i>
- Emily, Emily, okay.

1074
01:08:24,928 --> 01:08:26,345

<i>- I have blood on me.</i>

1076
01:08:28,387 --> 01:08:30,345
- It's okay.
<i>- Where is this from?</i>

1077
01:08:30,428 --> 01:08:32,387
It's not yours. Okay. Just look up.

1078
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:36,678
Okay? Look up and tell me where you are.
What can you see? I hear cars.

1079
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:38,845
Is that<i>…</i> Is that right?

1080
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:40,845
Are there cars nearby?

1081
01:08:42,678 --> 01:08:45,303
<i>Way down below.</i>

1082
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:47,719
What, the cars are?

1083
01:08:51,886 --> 01:08:56,262
Emily, are you on the freeway?
Are you… Are you on the overpass?

1084
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,845
<i>- Joe.</i>
- Emily.

1085
01:09:01,928 --> 01:09:03,886
<i>Joe, is it Henry's blood?</i>

1086
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:07,053
<i>Joe, is it Henry's blood?</i>

1087
01:09:12,095 --> 01:09:13,594
No, Henry's okay.

1088
01:09:15,928 --> 01:09:20,303
<i>If this isn't my blood then,
Joe, whose blood is this?</i>

1089
01:09:20,387 --> 01:09:21,886
No, Emily…

1090
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:25,719
<i>- Whose blood is this? Whose blood is this?</i>
- Emily. Emily.

1091

Tell me where you are

01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:42,178
<i>Is this Henry's?</i>

1097
01:09:46,636 --> 01:09:49,053
Hey, call CHP dispatch now!

<i>- You have to tell them I didn't mean it.</i>

1105
01:10:07,345 --> 01:10:10,719
No, Henry knows. Henry knows.
He was just trying to help you.

1106
01:10:10,803 --> 01:10:15,053
We were all just trying to help you.
We're all just trying to help you. Just…

1107
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,387
<i>You said that he deserved it, Joe.</i>

1108
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:26,303
I was wrong.

1109
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:29,636
It's my… It's my fault.

1110
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:33,553
It's my fault, Emily.
It's my fault that you're on the overpass.

1111
01:10:33,636 --> 01:10:37,553
Okay? Just please,
please don't do anything stupid.

1112
01:10:37,636 --> 01:10:40,053
Do you understand? Please.

1113
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:42,886
There are people who love you.

Okay? Abby… Abby loves you.

1115
01:10:49,803 --> 01:10:50,970
Abby needs you.

1116
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:55,970
Okay? Abby is waiting
for you to come home.

1117
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:59,427
Just please, Emily,
please just talk to me.

1118
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,886
- Talk to me.
<i>- I'm gonna go now.</i>

1119
01:11:03,386 --> 01:11:05,803
<i>- I'm gonna go be with Oliver.</i>
- No.

1120
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:09,053
<i>Joe, I'm gonna go be with Oliver.</i>

1121
01:11:09,137 --> 01:11:10,262
I killed a man.

1122
01:11:11,636 --> 01:11:13,511
Do you hear me? I… I killed a man.

1123
01:11:21,553 --> 01:11:22,511
Do you hear me?

1124
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:26,678
I killed a man. A boy actually.

1125
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:32,011
Nineteen years old.
Joseph. Still… still a boy.

1126
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:34,719
<i> Why? Why?</i>

1127
01:11:34,803 --> 01:11:37,262
<i>- Why?</i>
- I don't… I… I don't know.

1128
01:11:37,344 --> 01:11:40,386
I don't know.
I don't know because I… I could.

1129
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:42,344
I just wanted to punish him.

1130
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:45,095
I wanted to punish him
because I was angry.

1131
01:11:45,178 --> 01:11:50,511
I'm just so, I'm so angry,
and I… I… I just…

1132
01:11:50,594 --> 01:11:53,344
He… he… he did something
and he hurt someone.

1133
01:11:57,053 --> 01:11:59,469
He didn't… Did he hurt someone?

1134
01:11:59,553 --> 01:12:02,553
Uh, he… I don't know.

1135
01:12:02,636 --> 01:12:04,719
He hurt someone. Just please.

1136
01:12:05,636 --> 01:12:08,302
Uh, my… My… My…

1137
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:09,344
My dad…

1138
01:12:10,845 --> 01:12:11,970
Uh…

1139
01:12:13,886 --> 01:12:17,344
Just please. I can't kill you, too, Emily.

1140
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:22,427
I can't kill you too.

1141
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:25,803
<i>Joe?</i>

1142
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:28,594
<i>Why?</i>

1143
01:12:30,344 --> 01:12:31,678
<i>Was it snakes?</i>

1144
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,011
Yeah.

1145
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:44,344
Yes, it was snakes.

1146
01:12:51,261 --> 01:12:54,053
Just, I…

1147
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:58,845
I promised Abby
that you would come home.

1148
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:03,970
I promised her that you would come home.

1149
01:13:04,053 --> 01:13:06,886
- She needs you.
<i>- Abby.</i>

1150
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:12,053
<i>- Abby.</i>
- Yes.

1151
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:16,928
Please, I promised her. And so does Henry.

1152
01:13:17,928 --> 01:13:20,302
You have people who love you.

1153
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:28,511
Please. Please.

1154
01:13:30,761 --> 01:13:32,053
Please, Emily.

1155
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:40,095
<i>Joe. Joe.</i>

1156
01:13:41,594 --> 01:13:42,469
Yes?

1157
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:49,511
<i>I see the lights.</i>

1158
01:13:49,594 --> 01:13:52,302
Okay, Emily, just…

1159
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:55,344
go over to the officers.

1160
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,178
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

1161
01:13:58,928 --> 01:14:01,053
Just go over to the officers.

1162
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,261
<i>I'm gonna go be with Oliver, Joe.</i>

1163
01:14:06,302 --> 01:14:07,137
Emily?

1164
01:14:11,928 --> 01:14:15,469
<i>This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…</i>

1165
01:14:15,553 --> 01:14:17,261
<i>Stop it.</i>

1166
01:14:17,845 --> 01:14:21,511
<i>Leave me a message,
call later, or send a text. Bye.</i>

1167
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:22,970
No.

1168
01:14:25,219 --> 01:14:28,553
<i>This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…</i>

1169
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:30,594
<i>Stop it.</i>

1170
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:32,137
<i>Leave me a message…</i>

1171
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:39,594
<i>- California Highway Patrol.</i>
- It's Joe.

1172
01:14:41,928 --> 01:14:44,261
<i>We have her. She came down.</i>

1173
01:14:45,845 --> 01:14:48,095
Wait. What? You… you…

1174
01:14:48,177 --> 01:14:49,594
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1175
01:14:49,678 --> 01:14:52,219
<i>We have her. I'm on with the officers now.</i>

1176
01:14:52,803 --> 01:14:55,970
<i>She came down off the overpass.
We got her.</i>

1177
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:00,136
<i>Good job, Baylor.</i>

1178
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:27,761
Oh, uh…

1179
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:29,886
You got a message from Tim Geraci.

1180
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:33,803
- Who?
- The officer who went to the Lighton home.

1181
01:15:33,886 --> 01:15:36,845
He wanted you to know the baby
is in the ICU at St. Helen's.

1182
01:15:39,053 --> 01:15:39,970
Sorry, what?

1183
01:15:41,344 --> 01:15:44,219
The baby is in the ICU at St. Helen's.

1184
01:15:44,302 --> 01:15:46,803
- Oliver?
- Yeah, I guess.

1185
01:15:48,302 --> 01:15:50,594
- He's alive?
- Yeah.

1186
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:56,427
Broken people save broken people.

1187
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,803
<i>Hello.</i>

1188
01:18:46,511 --> 01:18:47,511
Hey, partner.

1189
01:18:49,511 --> 01:18:51,969
<i>- You find her?</i>
- Yeah.

1190
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:58,386
<i>That's good. </i>

1191
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:02,803
Are you home?

1192
01:19:05,386 --> 01:19:09,177
<i>No. I'm in my car.
Thought you might need me.</i>

1193
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:13,761
Go home.

1194
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:21,136
<i>I think I'm gonna shower at the station.
Go straight to the courthouse from there.</i>

1195
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:25,344
<i>You okay?</i>

1196
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:29,969
<i>Hey, what's up, man?</i>

1197
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:35,010
<i>Joe, you good?</i>

1198
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:45,803
<i>You there?</i>

1199
01:19:57,094 --> 01:19:59,219
Just tell… tell them what you saw, Rick.

1200
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:06,636
Today in court.

1201
01:20:11,511 --> 01:20:14,761
<i>Joe, we… we have a plan.</i>

1202
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:21,094
Just tell them the truth.

1203
01:20:22,802 --> 01:20:25,094
Just tell them the truth. Tell them…

1204
01:20:25,678 --> 01:20:28,261
<i>What, Joe?
What the fuck are you talking about?</i>

1205
01:20:29,177 --> 01:20:30,719
<i>I can't change my statement.</i>

1206
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:34,511
You can.

1207
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:39,177
<i>No, I can't. I can't. They'll burn you.</i>

1208
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,761
<i>We stick to our story.</i>
<i>I can't</i>… <i>I can't fucking change it, man.</i>

1209
01:20:50,969 --> 01:20:51,802
Rick.

1210
01:20:56,469 --> 01:20:58,177
I need you to give me your word.

1211
01:20:59,678 --> 01:21:00,594
<i>Joe.</i>

1212
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,885
Give me your word.

1213
01:21:17,302 --> 01:21:18,344
<i>Joe, brother.</i>

1214
01:21:24,177 --> 01:21:25,219
It's okay, Rick.

1215
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:31,678
<i>You won't see your daughter
for years, man.</i>

1216
01:21:52,678 --> 01:21:54,678
I'll talk to you… I'll talk to you soon.

1217
01:21:56,927 --> 01:21:57,844
All right?

1218
01:22:22,219 --> 01:22:25,094
<i>This is the</i> Los Angeles Times.
<i>How can I direct your call?</i>

1219
01:22:25,594 --> 01:22:27,594
Can you connect me to Katherine Harbor?

1220
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:29,344
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1221
01:22:30,136 --> 01:22:33,802
<i>Katherine Harbor. Yes.
I'll connect you now.</i>

1222
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,302
<i>Good morning. It's Katherine.</i>

1223
01:22:46,177 --> 01:22:47,219
This is Joe.

1224
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:58,760
<i>Breaking news.</i>
