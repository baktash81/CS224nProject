00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,981
One foot and then the other.

3
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:11,280
<i>Rise and shine, Pittsburgh!
This is Chuey Martinez on WQQC.</i>

4
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,324
<i>If you're up this early,
you're either out chasing a dream</i>

5
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>or out all night chasing something else.</i>

6
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:21,707
<i>Either way, don't let one L get you down,
you can always bounce back, baby. Let's go.</i>

7
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,436
Hi, Miss Murdoch.

8
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,649
Oh, shit! Bye, Miss Murdoch!

9
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,536
Let's see.

10
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,631
Thirty seconds slower than yesterday.

11
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,884
I'm sorry. I was... I was...

12
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,010
distracted.

13
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,518
- Again?
- Again. Come on.

14
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,935
If I could rap or something like you,
I would get all 10's.

15
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,480
But, like, any girl under an eight
is right out, you know.

16
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,025
I can't go below that. I'm better than that.

17
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,027
- That's interesting...
- Right?

18
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,445
Guys. Guess what.

19
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,863
- Is that a smoothie, man?
- Yeah.

20
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,115
It's better than soda. Nothing but empty calories.

21
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,659
I liked you so much better fat. It's not even funny.

22
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,745
Yeah. Well, your mom doesn't.

23
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,665
- That's gross.
- You still got fat-boy standards. Because you're fat.

24
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,167
- Okay. Shut up.
- You're still fat.

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,753
- Shut up!
- What's up, bro?

26
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,589
Big Sean tweeted that he's doing a free show
in Pittsburgh tonight!

27
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,759
- I wish I could believe that.
- Okay.

28
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,763
- Are you serious? Why didn't you say that?
- Yeah. Well, I told you...

29
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,723
I told you. We're going, right?

30
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,185
- Of course. What are you talking about?
- That's tight.

31
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,603
- It's not tight.
- Don't say it.

32
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,480
No, no, no.

33
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,858
I told my parents
I would finish my college application.

34
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,569
Look, I need this, okay?

35
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,987
I really need this.

36
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:43,825
I have one year left to lose my Scarlet V
and I've struck out with every acceptable girl in this school.

37
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,244
- Even Sarah?
- Even Sarah.

38
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,411
Yeah.

39
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,163
Get onboard. I need this.

40
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,290
- I have to finish my essay.
- Are you kidding me?

41
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,544
- It's the last day of school, Daryn.
- They're not due until September!

42
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,755
Be like Sammy. Don't go to college.
Aim for the lower middle.

43
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,102
- Darling.
- Thank you, my dear.

44
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,732
Well, it's a good start.

45
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,235
But I do have some notes.

46
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,613
Do we have to go through them right now?

47
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,158
Unless there's somewhere more important
you have to be.

48
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,120
No. I...

49
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,206
There's just this concert
that Sammy and Kiran invited me to.

50
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,416
That sounds fun.

51
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,751
What kind of concert?

52
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,839
It's just like a rap show. Rap concert.

53
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,010
I think he deserves a night off.

54
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,433
Be home by 11, son.

55
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,269
- Absolutely. Love you, Mom.
- I love you.

56
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,857
- I'll leave the notes on your desk.
- Cool.

57
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,067
"Cool."

58
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,237
All right, I see what you did there.

59
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,324
- Look at all these people.
- They should be lining up to see you, Daryn.

60
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,993
They would be lining up to see you if you record something.

61
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,663
- You could totally be the next Big Sean.
- Good God, look at these girls.

62
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,209
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi, how are you? I'm Kiran.

63
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,085
Kiran. Kiran.

64
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,047
- She did not pay attention to me.
- That's it, no one else in.

65
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,382
God, we should've come two hours ago.

66
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,427
- We'll never get in.
- If I don't get in, I don't get groupies.

67
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,513
You won't anyway, what's the difference?

68
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,555
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

69
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,891
- It's gonna happen.
- Yo, yo.

70
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,936
- Follow me. I got a plan. I got an idea.
- Follow you where?

71
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,979
Daryn. Daryn! Where...?

72
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,192
- Sorry. What are you doing?
- Get in here. Come. on.

73
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,319
- This is how horror movies start.
- Be cool.

74
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,114
- Just keep your cool.
- Daryn, let's just go back.

75
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,200
- Daryn.
- Chill. Chill. Chill.

76
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,625
- It's all right. Okay.
- Okay.

77
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,877
Daryn, I don't think...

78
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,254
- No.
- This is fate.

79
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,090
This is fate. Let's go. You ready?
You wanna see Big Sean.

80
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,592
Who's trying to talk me into it?
You not gonna go?

81
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,886
- Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.
- Make it bigger for Sammy.

82
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,973
- Let's go.
- I'm not fat anymore. Asshole.

83
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,559
- Oh, thanks for the help.
- Oh, man. Sorry.

84
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,520
Okay. All right.

85
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,149
- All right.
- Oh, I got it. I got it.

86
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,653
Ready?

87
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,075
- You've done this before, huh?
- Shut up.

88
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,913
Yo!

89
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,877
- Who are you?
- Daryn.

90
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,964
I'm Daryn.
Are you, like, with the tour or something?

91
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,592
Duh. Now piss off, square.

92
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,846
Well, just a second
because my friend here has a head injury!

93
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,763
Wait. What?

94
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,309
His mom dropped him when he was very young,
and ever since he has as a condition

95
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,313
to where he can't see things
unless he's on top of other things.

96
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,024
Perfect example, this thing that you're on top of,

97
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:06,987
we'd love to watch the show with you up there
for medical reasons.

98
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,238
Right.

99
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:14,703
- Oh, yeah. I can't see a damn thing!
- You know what I'm saying?

100
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,165
- I am freaking out right now, man!
- You know what I mean?

101
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,876
- I don't know where I am, Daryn.
- Calm down. Do you see this?

102
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,794
- I need to get inside!
- Come on.

103
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:27,132
- The darkness scares me, Daryn.
- Over here. Over here. Can you help us?

104
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,342
Fifty bucks. Each.

105
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,763
Each? We're paying for his medication and all,
we don't have that money.

106
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,390
Nice try, square. You're wearing loafers.

107
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,809
So either you have money
or you jacked someone who did.

108
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,729
I'm pretty sure it's the first.

109
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,773
Damn it, Daryn.

110
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:48,570
- All right. How about this, 60 for all of us?
- All right. Show me the paper.

111
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,364
- Deal. Now, you can see...
- Hey!

112
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,490
What...?

113
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,536
- You kids can't be back here.
- Okay. Cool. She said it was fine.

114
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,954
And who is she?

115
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,831
Yeah. What is...? Yeah.
What is your name?

116
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,335
Wait. Is somebody up there?
You can't be up there!

117
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:07,673
Yeah? Well, I'd like to see you Spider-Man
your Hulk ass up here and do something about it, all right?

118
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,466
- What?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,176
- Oh, shit!
- Come back here.

120
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,845
You're in for it now!

121
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,390
- Hey. Hey, man. Leave her alone.
- Hands off, kid!

122
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,474
Hey. Hey!

123
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,268
Okay.

124
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,149
Hey, it's cool, man. I used to be fat too.
So we're basically like brothers.

125
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,150
Hey!

126
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,445
Oh, my God. You just punched him!

127
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,699
- Oh, you suck at punching, Daryn!
- My turn.

128
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,950
Up here, big head!

129
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,495
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, shit.

130
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,873
Did she just kill him? We're going to jail.

131
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,250
- I don't like blood.
- Yo, hey!

132
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,586
Hey! Hey! Wait!

133
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,839
What's your name?

134
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,425
Isabelle!

135
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,303
- Isabelle.
- Daryn? Oh, shit.

136
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,599
- Daryn.
- You're all dead!

137
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,851
- Shit.
- We're going to hell!

138
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,644
- Daryn!
- Oh, shit!

139
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,980
- Hey! Isabelle!
- Daryn, where are we going?

140
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,109
- Isabelle! Isabelle!
- Come here!

141
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,945
- Go away!
- You're a track star, run faster!

142
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,906
Holy shit!

143
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,183
Yo!

144
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,143
Bro, what's so clutch we had to rush here?

145
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,895
Yeah, Daryn, I shouldn't be here.

146
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,938
Me and this place got some bad memories, so...

147
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,190
Yeah. I get that.

148
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,318
But I need you guys to just take a look inside
because I need some help.

149
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,070
I know what's inside
because I came here every day after school.

150
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,656
I didn't bring you here
to see what flavor ice cream I want.

151
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,659
There's something in here
that I really need you to see.

152
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,748
- Shit!
- You see?

153
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,375
- You see? Yes.
- The scary girl from the concert. So what?

154
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,586
Yes.

155
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,421
- You like her.
- I mean, No, no, no.

156
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,174
- You like her.
- No, no. It's not like that. It's not like that.

157
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,302
- Even if I did, do you think she likes me?
- No. She doesn't like you.

158
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,221
- Can we go, please?
- Yo, look.

159
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,682
In my 17 years of living, no girl has ever liked me.
Doesn't stop me from trying.

160
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,934
- Right now?
- Yeah, now.

161
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,729
- I'm still in my clothes...
- It doesn't matter. You look good.

162
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,898
It's all good. You're good, baby.

163
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,317
Hey, maybe it's okay
if I just get like a small cone.

164
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,612
But no hot fudge.
Maybe some hot fudge, but no jimmies.

165
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,614
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

166
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,576
Welcome to The Big Chill.
What frozen moo juice do you guys want?

167
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,205
- You know...
- Wait a minute.

168
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:13,168
I know you. You're that square that owes me 60 bucks.

169
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,549
Yes. I remember, from the concert.

170
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:22,135
That's crazy that we're running into each other.
I'm Daryn.

171
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,971
Great to see you. Great to see you...

172
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,850
You know what, how's it going?
I think we'll take three small vanilla cones.

173
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,561
One with jimmies and hot fudge, please.

174
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,355
- Do you want any whipped cream with that?
- Yes.

175
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,983
Seven dollars and twenty-three cents.

176
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:36,900
Thank you.

177
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,486
And $2.77 makes 10.

178
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,614
- Alrighty.
- Don't!

179
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,660
Just don't tip me, okay? If you tip me I have to sing.
So don't.

180
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,913
Well, I gotta hear that.

181
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,334
We got a tip, everybody!

182
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,631
Five, six, seven...

183
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,287
- Wow, that was amazing.
- So good.

184
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,290
Okay. Have a good day, sir. Goodbye!

185
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,170
- Really?
- Sorry.

186
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,006
- I just... It was too good.
- From the top, people!

187
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,883
I'm going on a break.

188
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,513
Wait, wait, wait.

189
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,015
<i>It seems like I made you mad
That's not what I wanna do</i>

190
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,768
<i>'Cause, baby, me and you
Could go together like a double scoop</i>

191
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,520
<i>Your green eyes
I'm hypnotized</i>

192
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,356
<i>I need a lemon lime ice cream
I emphasize</i>

193
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,398
<i>I need you in my life</i>

194
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,109
<i>I think that we could chill
And get a bite together</i>

195
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,779
<i>Please don't walk away
'Cause I'll be tipping you forever</i>

196
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:07,658
Now that is ice cream. Yeah.

197
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,333
- So...
- Hell no.

198
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,672
All right. But you know what
makes me feel better after rejection?

199
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,382
- More music.
- Okay, wait.

200
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,095
Hold on. Okay, fine. Fine. You can...
You can walk me home after work.

201
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,306
Okay. Great. That's fantastic.
Okay. I'll be here.

202
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,933
What time do you get off?

203
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,268
- Ten.
- Ten it is.

204
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,477
It's perfect. It's a date.

205
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,479
- It's not a date.
- It sounds like a date.

206
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:40,190
That's my man right there.
I'll see you then, good times.

207
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,484
- Dude, that was so sick.
- Double scoop.

208
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,486
You're like James Bond.
Can you teach me that?

209
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,620
- I live in Wilkinsburg.
- Yeah?

210
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,707
- So...
- If you drive that in, you're limping out.

211
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,710
So I guess I'm walking you home?

212
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,005
Sure. Whatever.

213
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,889
I like your hair.

214
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,686
So, what school do you go to?

215
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,646
I don't go to school.

216
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,565
Isn't that, like, illegal?

217
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,610
I don't know. Probably.

218
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,448
- Are you...?
- Yeah. Hands off, square, all right?

219
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,783
Hey, come back here. That's my pop.

220
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,952
Well, I stole it! So it's mine now.

221
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,205
Get back here, that's my pop. Hey!

222
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,415
Izzy, hey, I got a free soda.

223
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,334
- That's my pop!
- Well, it's mine now.

224
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,922
- I stole it. Because you're being a discriminating dick!
- Don't you come back, you freak.

225
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,632
- Hey, Izzy, baby.
- What's up, Phil?

226
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,300
Who's Mr. New Sugar?

227
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:53,222
- His name is Square.
- Hello, ma'am. Good to meet you. I'm Daryn.

228
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,306
Very polite.

229
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,393
And he's got all his teeth. That's an upgrade for you, Izzy.

230
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,563
Okay, you two lovebirds, I'm gonna go to work.
Leftovers in the fridge.

231
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,358
- Thanks.
- Oh, and don't be too scared.

232
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:09,780
I know how she gets but even the toughest
kitty cats purr if you know just where to pet them.

233
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,281
- What was that?
- Bye-bye.

234
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,492
- Phil, come on. All right. See you later.
- Bye, Izzy.

235
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:18,413
- So... So is that your mom?
- No.

236
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,500
- Okay, so dad? That's confusing.
- No?

237
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,295
This is a nice place.

238
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,548
It's a shit-box. I'm poor, not blind.

239
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:36,515
So I think that, you know,
I think me and you should, like, go on a proper date.

240
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,559
I don't date squares.

241
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:42,688
Well, I think you should
because you know, we're smart, we're punctual,

242
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:46,066
we can pay for stuff.
You can use us to draw straight lines.

243
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:50,445
Okay, fine. But just once, and mostly out of pity.

244
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,241
Okay. Great. Saturday, here. I'll pick you up at 7.
It's a date. It will be fun.

245
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:58,370
- It's not a date.
- Okay. Okay. Have a good night.

246
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,792
In your holy and precious name we pray. Amen.

247
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,003
- Amen.
- Amen.

248
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,882
I have some good news.

249
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,635
The Maxwells have invited us over
to a reception on Saturday.

250
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,639
David Maxwell's brother
is on the board of trustees for Harvard.

251
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:21,393
- Nice.
- I... I actually had plans for Saturday.

252
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,442
Are these plans more important
than your future, son?

253
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,029
Nine o'clock sharp, Daryn.

254
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,366
Nine o'clock sharp.

255
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,836
What's that with the clock, twitchy? Got a hot date?

256
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:52,382
No. It's just this thing
that my dad is making me go to later.

257
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:56,011
But I got an early reservation at Creme Petite. So...

258
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,971
Nice. Who you going there with?

259
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,224
Well, you.

260
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:05,395
Hi, I'm Isabelle, the girl that you think
is impressed by fancy clothes, a nice car,

261
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,189
and a restaurant full of old people.

262
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:10,943
I'm sorry. I just... I don't know... I just...

263
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,779
I've never been out with anyone like you before.

264
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,614
Meaning?

265
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:19,326
Meaning someone that I really like.

266
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:26,959
Oh, shit. Okay. Fine.

267
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,879
Take a left at the lights. I know a good place.

268
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,299
Okay.

269
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,425
Order up!

270
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,637
- Is this even food?
- It's the best kind of food.

271
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,055
This...

272
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,141
looks like Freddy Kruger's ball sack.

273
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:47,271
- Wow, delicious ball sack.
- You kind of catch my drift?

274
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,606
Yeah.

275
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,317
- Just try it, Square.
- Well, how about this? How about this?

276
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,362
I'll try it if you tell me
why you don't go to school.

277
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,738
Who cares?

278
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,449
Don't you feel it's important for your life?
For the future?

279
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,118
- What future?
- What do you mean?

280
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,745
Like, scholarship, Harvard.

281
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,832
Law school. Clerking.

282
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,001
- You got it all planned out.
- Yeah.

283
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,628
I mean, me and my dad,
we try to formulate a plan and just...

284
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,173
Wait a minute. Papa Square.
That would be your rap name.

285
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,385
- No. I'm not... I'm not gonna be...
- Makes you sound old.

286
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:22,639
- Square. Son of Square.
- I'm not gonna be a rapper. It's just... It's not practical.

287
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,682
Square-Squared.

288
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,270
Look, you're good. I've seen you do it.

289
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:33,775
It doesn't matter. Just between Honor Society,
Student Council, track...

290
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,445
Can you hear yourself? You're just listing off bullshit.

291
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,071
It's like:

292
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:43,076
That's not bullshit. That's my life.
I hold the state record in the 5,000 meter.

293
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,748
- Is that what you really want though? Out of life?
- It's not about what I want.

294
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:53,420
It's about identifying a goal and making and reaching
that goal, making it happen, making it a reality.

295
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,755
You sound like a robot.

296
00:20:55,964 --> 00:21:01,345
Do you know how hard it is to get into Harvard?
They take less than 6 percent.

297
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,681
Less than 6 percent.
That's six out of a hundred.

298
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:08,810
Do you realize how little that is? Six percent...
Greatness requires sacrifice.

299
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,979
You can't do what you want. Do you know that?

300
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,649
- Why not?
- Prison.

301
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,110
Look, just because I know what I want
doesn't mean I always get it, okay?

302
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,571
But at least I'm honest with myself about what I want.

303
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:24,493
That's why I don't go to school, because I don't want to.

304
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,371
Now dig in. It's gonna get cold.

305
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,956
Come on.

306
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,459
- This is just disgusting.
- In your mouth.

307
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,961
Yeah?

308
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,007
There you go.

309
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:43,804
- That's good.
- Yeah.

310
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:47,850
- That's good.
- Look, everyone! Square has joined the human race.

311
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,601
Welcome to the human race, Square.

312
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,187
Welcome. Welcome to the human race.

313
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:55,941
I've been in the crew... In the human race crew...

314
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,317
What do you actually want?

315
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,112
You? Not your dad, not your mom.

316
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,114
What do you want?

317
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,829
I wanna take you out again.

318
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:23,927
Well, I can assure you, Mr. Maxwell,
that it's not like Daryn to be late.

319
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,221
No, not at all.

320
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,099
Here he is.

321
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,770
- Oh, poor dear.
- I'm so sorry.

322
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,774
- I'm sorry. Car troubles.
- Daryn, this is James Maxwell.

323
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:41,528
- How are you, sir?
- Your father told me your quite an athlete.

324
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:46,283
- Captain of the track team and his not quite yet a senior.
- Sir?

325
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:52,247
You humiliated me, son. Don't let it happen again.

326
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:55,584
- I'm sorry. You were saying?
- Harvard.

327
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:59,338
- Of course.
- Yes.

328
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,689
So one more?

329
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,318
One more.

330
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,205
It does?

331
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:36,083
Yes. Thank you.

332
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,879
- One more?
- One more.

333
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,618
One more?

334
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:12,911
One more.

335
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,503
- Hey.
- Hey, hold on a second.

336
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,590
- Who is she?
- Who is who?

337
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,930
She's just a girl.

338
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,809
- Does this girl have a name?
- Isabelle.

339
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:39,438
Here's the thing, son.

340
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,025
School has started, which means summer is over.

341
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:46,403
This little fling of yours
is starting to become a real distraction.

342
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,239
What does greatness require?

343
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,536
- Sacrifice.
- Sacrifice, son.

344
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,371
Sacrifice.

345
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,343
Do you really think that was necessary?

346
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:13,805
You didn't see her.
Believe me, a girl like this has no future.

347
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,350
It's better it ended now.

348
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,896
I wish my dad was a drag queen.

349
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,814
Phil's cool but he's not my dad.

350
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:26,902
- I never really knew my father.
- What about your mom?

351
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,946
Well, she left when I was 6.

352
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,782
Classic Wilkinsburg junkie.

353
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,659
Where is she now?

354
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,160
Who cares?

355
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,580
Phil was babysitting and just,
you know, kept on babysitting.

356
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:45,045
- So are you thirsty at all?
- What?

357
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,966
Just because... I could just use some water
because I get thirsty.

358
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:56,306
Okay. You can come up, but you're not,
you know, getting up in me or whatever.

359
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,017
I just wanted some water.

360
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,907
Don't touch anything.

361
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,410
I wasn't going to.

362
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,220
Here's your water.

363
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,933
Yeah. It's supposed to be that color.

364
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,727
Okay.

365
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:48,442
- Wow, you really were thirsty.
- Yeah.

366
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,819
So...

367
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:52,279
you like the beach?

368
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,658
{\an8}Yeah, I do.

369
00:26:56,742 --> 00:27:00,495
I like to imagine that I'm floating on the waves.

370
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,210
Just laying back and letting the whole ocean lift you up.

371
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,131
It's probably the closest I'll ever get though.

372
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,051
A bunch of crappy postcards.

373
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:21,558
- I mean, we could just go to the beach though.
- Yeah, sure.

374
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,894
I'll get my bikini.

375
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,812
Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:31,193
- Yeah. No, but we could really go. Yeah.
- You're serious?

377
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,875
- We shouldn't have done that.
- What's wrong?

378
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,585
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

379
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,671
You were just kissing me, now you're not.

380
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,715
- Your gonna have to leave.
- But people do things when they're dating.

381
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,842
We're not dating, Daryn.

382
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,135
- Then what are we doing?
- We're hanging out.

383
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,722
- That's what dating is. Is there another guy?
- No.

384
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,350
- You have some hidden boyfriend?
- There's not another guy.

385
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,268
Do you like me?

386
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,312
- We've been hanging out for two months. Do you like me?
- I don't know.

387
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:09,106
What do you mean you don't know?

388
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,149
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is, Izzy.

389
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,276
Do you like me or not?

390
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,570
- I don't like you, okay? Just leave it.
- What?

391
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,406
Okay. Well, I don't care because I love you.

392
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,367
- Oh, my God. Please.
- What do you mean?

393
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,910
- Okay. Please.
- I can't.

394
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,245
Everywhere I look, I see you.

395
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:27,499
Even when it's not you, I'm just chasing after somebody.
I seen green hair, I thought it was you.

396
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:30,002
- You got to leave. Get out.
- You're telling me to leave?

397
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,338
- No, I'm not gonna leave because I love you!
- Stop! Just stop!

398
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,215
- Stop what? I can't what?
- You can't!

399
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:39,094
- Daryn, stop! Please!
- I love you! I love you.

400
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,937
I have a year to live, if that.

401
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,441
Still love me now, Daryn?

402
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:53,859
Still love me now?

403
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,486
- We can figure something...
- There is no "we"!

404
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,281
Get out of my house. Get out! Get out!

405
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,790
Shit.

406
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,755
You know what?

407
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:16,924
Get up.

408
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,967
Get up! Both of you. Up. Come on.

409
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,428
Just do it. Trust me. Up. Come on.

410
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,306
Get up.

411
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,183
Scream.

412
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,768
What?

413
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,978
The universe is an asshole.

414
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:33,607
They gave your girl cancer. Don't just take it.
Yell in its face. Do it right now.

415
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,318
- Do it.
- Why?

416
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,321
Sometimes that's all you can do, right?

417
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,407
- Trust me.
- I can't. I...

418
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,459
Suck this, big universe!

419
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,003
- That's it. Do it.
- Come on. Try it.

420
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,171
Do it.

421
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,884
- I hate you, universe!
- Yeah. There it is.

422
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,303
- You punk-ass-bully-bitch, universe!
- Yeah!

423
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,973
- Up yours, universe!
- Why did you do that?

424
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,935
- Terrible universe!
- You suck! You suck so much!

425
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,062
Seventeen years! Still a virgin!

426
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,482
I'm still humping a pumpkin!
And you give him everything that he wants!

427
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:19,486
Goddamn white Kevin-Hart-looking piece of shit.
And I can't get anything?

428
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,031
I'm shaving all this shit trying to be pretty for y'all
and it's still...

429
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,533
- Kiran!
- It's not...

430
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,035
What are you doing?

431
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:33,709
- No. Yeah, I know. I just felt like...
- "Shaving my shit." What was that?

432
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,836
You really shave that shit?

433
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,046
- Yeah. Every other week.
- Why?

434
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,215
- Because my mom says that it adds...
- Your mom?

435
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,800
- Did you just say your...? Dude.
- No.

436
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:44,845
- You have this weird relationship with your mom.
- We're not that close.

437
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,774
Nothing from Harvard yet.

438
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:01,069
It's still too early but you never know.

439
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:03,739
You're gonna get in, son.

440
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,700
You're gonna get in. It's just a formality.

441
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,165
I know it's not always easy,

442
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,627
but nothing worthwhile ever is.

443
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,923
Life can be hard, son.

444
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:26,178
That's why we make plans. Hear me?

445
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,807
That's why we make plans.

446
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,230
I gotta go, Dad. Thank you.

447
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,615
I love you and... Izzy!

448
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,952
Izzy, I know it sounds crazy but I love you. I'm serious.

449
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:55,499
And I don't care if you only have a year to leave,
if it's the rest of your life then it's everything to me!

450
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,919
Izzy, I have a plan. I have a plan, Izzy.

451
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,631
We're gonna live our whole life, all the milestones.
Everything that we can think off.

452
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:06,760
A full, a whole, a complete life.
All in this year. Me and you.

453
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:10,264
Go away, Daryn, okay? I don't believe in happy endings.

454
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:14,351
Well, believe in me, Iz.

455
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:21,108
I'm serious about this, Izzy.
I think this is a really, really good idea.

456
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,194
It's gonna be like freaking Disneyland.

457
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:27,656
I don't even know what that means. And I'm...

458
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:32,077
Izzy, I know it's hard to believe but I love you.
I'm dead serious and...

459
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:35,247
One condition.

460
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,748
Anything.

461
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,376
You have to stop saying I love you.

462
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,088
Everybody thinks they're in love until they're not.
It's not real.

463
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,300
There's just people that aren't the worst right now.

464
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,219
Do we have a deal?

465
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,431
Deal.

466
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:02,566
- What was that?
- First milestone.

467
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,001
All right, guys.

468
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,129
- Come on, Nacho.
- Milestones are complete.

469
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:27,299
MILESTONES

470
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,884
Very OCD of you, Daryn.

471
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:33,096
{\an8}I still say running the old A-train is a milestone.

472
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,641
Why is the ass hairy?

473
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:39,061
Look, this is my attic, okay?
I'll draw the ass how I want to.

474
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,647
- You want the ass to be hairy?
- It's not hairy. It's like...

475
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,274
- Then what is that?
- Guys, guys! Cool? Yeah?

476
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,026
- Sorry.
- This is the whole plan.

477
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:49,821
So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna plot
these milestones throughout the whole year.

478
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,990
All right. All right. What's first?

479
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,622
Lovebirds needs a nest.

480
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:02,084
- Yeah. That feels like a just-Daryn thing.
- Yeah.

481
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,127
Have fun, buddy.

482
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:10,676
{\an8}The neo-brutalist foundation is accentuated
by finishes in maple, marble, granite, glass,

483
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:13,053
and, of course, brushed aluminum.

484
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:17,391
Does anyone have any questions at this point?
What is it now?

485
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:22,396
Darling, do you know how many Indian
burial grounds this house is built upon?

486
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,982
None. There's no burial grounds here.

487
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,860
- Bullocks! Blasphemy!
- Big bullocks!

488
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,945
Okay. Stop it. Stop. You're not British.

489
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,822
- I'm so British.
- Slander!

490
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,949
I have half a mind to report you
to the bumbershoots!

491
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,077
A bumbershoot is an umbrella.

492
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,415
Okay. Look, you've had your fun.
Now it's time to run along, okay? Go home to your parents.

493
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,751
Maybe you're right
Maybe we are just kids playing make-believe.

494
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:45,668
Maybe?

495
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:49,715
Or maybe this kid here
just sold 2 million albums

496
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:53,177
and finished a world tour opening for Big Sean.

497
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,929
Maybe <i>Rolling Stone</i>
called him the voice of a generation

498
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,600
and Kanye is about to drop on his next single.

499
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,562
And maybe when he gets on that mic,

500
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:06,732
minds are blown and panties are thrown.

501
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:12,279
Ladies and gentleman, D-Square.
Come on. Give them a taste.

502
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:17,034
- Taste of what?
- Your skills.

503
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:26,168
Or maybe...

504
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,544
Run!

505
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,966
- To the bumbershoots!
- Bumbershoots!

506
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,052
Every open house, huh?

507
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,599
Oh, that was good.

508
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,728
Major flaw.

509
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,108
- This was you. You messed up.
- This was you.

510
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:59,284
I'm almost positive November comes before December.
Who put this shit up here?

511
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,537
All right.

512
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,583
So watch this one. Boom, there it is.

513
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,670
Start the engine. Turn. Turn.

514
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:13,006
- Okay. I'm taking my hands off the wheel.
- No!

515
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,300
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

516
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,512
- Excuse me. Oh, sorry, sir.
- This is a hospital.

517
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,642
- Thank you.
- I'll be back in a bit.

518
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,231
Does that hurt?

519
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,068
I'm getting used to it.

520
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:38,949
So this joker over here, that's Sleepy Simon.

521
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:43,287
He thinks prostate cancer is worse than ovarian cancer.

522
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,290
We've got a pretty hefty bet
who's gonna kick it first.

523
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:49,710
He thinks he's got it in the bag
but I'm feeling pretty lucky.

524
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:53,672
Stop saying stuff like that, Izzy. You're fine.

525
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,634
- Are you still gonna like me when I look like that?
- No.

526
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,804
- No?
- No.

527
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:02,806
You're never gonna look like that.

528
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,935
- You're a 10, baby. But that's a 12 over there.
- Lucky bastard.

529
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:17,029
Tina Tuna.

530
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,948
- Salmon L. Jackson.
- Good Gill Hunting.

531
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:23,202
- For Cod sake. It doesn't matter what you call him.
- Okay. That was good.

532
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,495
It's a Wilkinsburg fish.
He'll be dead in an hour.

533
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:29,041
No. No. Not true. Just need some vitamins.
Maybe some fish oils.

534
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:33,003
- Your place is this way.
- Come on. We're making a stop.

535
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:36,006
- To where?
- Just come with me.

536
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:37,883
Open up!

537
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:41,678
- Are those bullet holes?
- Probably.

538
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,439
Don't be knocking on my door like the police.

539
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:58,862
- What's up, Ron? Ron, this is Daryn.
- What up, Iz?

540
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:00,948
- Daryn, this is Ron.
- How are you, sir?

541
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,700
- Great to meet you.
- Your fish is dead, kid.

542
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:09,414
- What did I tell you? Come on.
- Izzy. Izzy, what are we even doing here?

543
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,208
Buying crack.

544
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:15,671
Okay, Daryn, welcome home.

545
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:17,798
Cool, right?

546
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:21,593
This is insane. I was not expecting this to be down here.

547
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:22,719
That's the idea.

548
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:26,390
Dopeheads find out about all this,
they'd be here like roaches in a cereal box.

549
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,809
- Shit.
- Ron used to be a big deal.

550
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,436
A long, long, long time ago.

551
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,064
- That's cold, Iz.
- I'm joking.

552
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,109
- It's a really nice spot you've got here, Ron.
- Thank you, yo.

553
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,987
That's called my booth of proof.
So let me see what you got.

554
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,616
- Me?
- No, no, that goofy kid behind you.

555
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,661
No.

556
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:56,962
No, like, I don't, like... I don't make music.
Like, I never been in one of this...

557
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,131
In a recording space before.

558
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,009
- Don't look so nervous. Get in.
- I don't rap.

559
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,387
- He's kidding. Let's go. Come on.
- I don't... Seriously. No, no. I don't...

560
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,890
- Come on, let's go. Hurry up.
- Izzy, I just... All right.

561
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,518
Dude, you're wasting time.
Stop talking. Start rapping. Go.

562
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,188
Just don't choke, okay?

563
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:15,856
I'm kidding.

564
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:21,069
- <i>Shark Tank</i> starts in 20. Let's get it.
- Okay.

565
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,240
Yeah. Okay.

566
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:47,804
Hey, yo, when the beat drops, you start spitting, all right?

567
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:52,267
Okay, cool. What is the drop that you're referring to?
What does that mean?

568
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,273
- I'll count you in right here.
- Okay.

569
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:02,444
- Spit.
- This is the beat dropping? It just happened?

570
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,196
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah, yo.

571
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,991
- That's where I'm supposed to be rapping, right?
- Just do you.

572
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,785
- Okay?
- Don't touch my button.

573
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,371
- I know. You get sensitive...
- Let me...

574
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:16,166
You're right. Just do me. Just do me. All right.

575
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,751
Here it comes again.

576
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:22,005
<i>Yo, titties in my face
Drop a hundred million on a chain</i>

577
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,550
<i>Strippers in the back
Of the whip like that</i>

578
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:28,720
<i>Grab 100K in my Winnie the Pooh blanket
Had a sad time, then I'm drinking</i>

579
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,223
<i>I got cash
Hella cash</i>

580
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,141
<i>I'm in a Rolls-Royce</i>

581
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,894
I thought you said he was good.

582
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:39,481
<i>Now I got a hundred dollar...
Had to do it like a kind of sin</i>

583
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,358
<i>I turned 10
It's a young boys school...</i>

584
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,776
What are you doing?

585
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,320
You're embarrassing me
with weird wannabe-ass titty rap.

586
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:48,115
I don't even know where I am.
I don't even wanna be in here.

587
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,576
- This is where you wanna be.
- You're embarrassing me.

588
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:54,663
- I'll let y'all figure it out while I get a beer.
- Dude, sit down!

589
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:59,251
And you, say something! You're wasting my time!
Or is this not part of your perfectly created plan?

590
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:02,004
No, this is not part of the plan, come on.

591
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,091
Ron, did you know that Daryn has a plan?
Him and his daddy have it all figured out.

592
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:09,595
He's gonna go to Harvard
because that's what his daddy wants.

593
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,097
You know what? They only take 6 percent.

594
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,391
- Six percent, seems crazy.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

595
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:18,270
Couldn't believe it's that easy.
I wish my odds were that good.

596
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:22,608
But they're not. I don't have a future. My odds suck!

597
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,277
But I get it. This is hard, right?

598
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,073
But running, that's easy for you. You're good at that.
You got the state record and everything.

599
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:34,745
So you know what? Run home, Daddy's boy,
because I haven't got time for this shit.

600
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,414
See you later, Ron. I'm sorry.

601
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,711
- Iz.
- What you know about my life, huh?

602
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,254
- Nothing!
- Iz.

603
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:48,967
What you know about the 5 a.m. running
before the sun up? Nothing!

604
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:50,761
<i>How you dare disrespect me?</i>

605
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,555
<i>5k record holder
Captain of the track</i>

606
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,516
<i>City on my shoulder
Thought I told you</i>

607
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,935
<i>I'm the illest and the fastest
These jokers trash</i>

608
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,938
<i>And they moving slower than molasses
I'm about to pass them</i>

609
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,231
<i>I'm taking off like a rocket</i>

610
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,650
<i>But please, don't worry, baby girl
'Cause I got this</i>

611
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,236
<i>Yo
Man, I got this</i>

612
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,321
<i>You should worry about your life
Man, I got this</i>

613
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:12,115
<i>How you expected to survive?
Man, I got this</i>

614
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,201
<i>I'm your guy
And you know that I got this</i>

615
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,079
Oh, my God.

616
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:21,708
<i>I can't believe
What I finally achieved</i>

617
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,044
<i>Man, you got me in a stu
I don't think I'll ever leave</i>

618
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,880
<i>Man, my heart is racing
You can see my pulse through my sleeve</i>

619
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,924
<i>The flow is biblical
Now I'm parting the sea</i>

620
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,009
<i>Jeez
Now I think I'm starting to see</i>

621
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:33,720
<i>Man, I need to shake off Harvard
Get my heart in the street</i>

622
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:35,848
<i>But that isn't the man
I was brought up to be</i>

623
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:38,308
<i>I'm thinking about my father
It gets harder to breathe</i>

624
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:41,144
<i>Like, wait
Do I got this?</i>

625
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,480
<i>Man, I'm worried about my life
Do I got this?</i>

626
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,649
<i>How am I expected to survive?
Do I got this?</i>

627
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,818
<i>Now I'm tripping
Because I don't think I got this</i>

628
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,736
<i>If being a son is a job
You should fire me</i>

629
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,698
<i>I'm sick of buying ties and competing with
Ivy-League Honor roll kids</i>

630
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,200
<i>Trying to make it high society
My life is a marathon</i>

631
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,828
<i>It don't have no privacy
From the ghost of my father's shadow</i>

632
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,538
<i>I hope in my life
I could take it far</i>

633
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:02,082
<i>I know I care
My baby girl got me drawn in</i>

634
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,293
<i>The boy is sick
You got a towel, then throw it in</i>

635
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:06,545
<i>Ron looking at my face
Like, "We need more of this"</i>

636
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:09,256
<i>Damn, why can't you let me be
Who I wanna be?</i>

637
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,216
<i>Life is love
My love is right in front of me</i>

638
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,302
<i>You made me so passive
And this is my reaction</i>

639
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:17,347
<i>When you only pay attention to goals
That's what happens, yo</i>

640
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:18,265
<i>Man, I got this</i>

641
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:20,684
<i>You should worry about your life
Man, I got this</i>

642
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,353
<i>How you expected to survive?
Man, I got this</i>

643
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:26,398
<i>Are you gonna buy a ride?
Man, I got this, yo</i>

644
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:27,941
<i>Isabelle, I got this</i>

645
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,943
<i>We got our whole life
No watches</i>

646
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:32,529
<i>Now we about to fly a plane
In a cockpit</i>

647
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:35,574
<i>I'm your guy
And you know that I got this, yo</i>

648
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:38,452
Oh, my God.

649
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,913
I got this. Oh, man.

650
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,206
I got this!

651
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,375
- I got this!
- Here it is, here it is, here it is.

652
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,921
- I'm proud of you, Square.
- Congratulations.

653
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:50,130
Oh, my goodness.

654
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:56,553
Do you have, like, an iCloud account
or, like, a thumb drive or something?

655
00:43:56,637 --> 00:44:00,933
- Dude, clouds are for cupids, man.
- What's that mean?

656
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:04,019
Look, if you want folks to feel your music,
you gotta feel it first.

657
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:08,065
You know what I mean?
You gotta touch it, feel it, smell it. Okay?

658
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,400
Yeah, I like it.

659
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:12,152
Thank you. Thank you.

660
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:15,697
- I'm gonna get back to my shark tank.
- I really appreciate this, bro. I really...

661
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:19,660
Whoa, industry rule 489.
Hip-hoppers, we don't hug. We just hit it right here.

662
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,245
- Okay. Bump. There it is.
- Bump.

663
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,580
Ron doesn't like touching, okay?

664
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,624
- See you later.
- See you next time, bro.

665
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,431
Oh, shit.

666
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:54,444
How many people do you think drowned here?

667
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,282
I say, around 3,000.

668
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,075
Mostly witches though.

669
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:03,203
Yeah, it's definitely creepy.

670
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:08,000
- What's up, Square? What's wrong?
- Okay.

671
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:12,171
- Okay. Sit down. What's going on?
- Okay. Okay.

672
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,217
- Isabelle...
- Oh, shit.

673
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,053
Will you marry me?

674
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:27,811
Are you really asking me to marry you
or is this just another milestone?

675
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,396
Well, this is...

676
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:33,692
- Yes. I'm asking you...
- How's Friday?

677
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:37,821
- Wow, yeah, this is beautiful.
- This Friday?

678
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:43,660
Yeah, you're right. That's too far away. We should do it
tomorrow, right? That's a great idea.

679
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:46,246
- Okay, yeah, that's...
- Yeah, I can see it now.

680
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,000
Everyone in black tie, except me, of course.
I'll be in white.

681
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:54,588
Bright, bright white, just like our cake,
which will be shaped like our love.

682
00:45:54,671 --> 00:46:00,052
We'll have a perfect fairy-tale wedding.
And we'll go on our honeymoon, to Niagara Falls.

683
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:03,013
We'll get a suite and a heart-shaped bed.

684
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:06,308
And then, we'll get to work making babies, am I right?

685
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:10,312
We need a shit-ton of babies
if I'm gonna have a happily ever after.

686
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,902
Except I can't have a happily ever after.

687
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:21,323
Don't you get it?

688
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:32,668
What...? What is going on?

689
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,754
What have you done now?

690
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:45,264
Oh, guys. Oh, my God.

691
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,062
I'm sorry. I just thought you would like it.

692
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:56,775
- Why don't we just stick to make-believe, okay?
- Yeah.

693
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,528
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it's okay. I'm sorry.

694
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:03,073
I'm sticking to make-believe.

695
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:06,618
- Are you cold?
- Yeah, let's go back home. Sorry.

696
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:09,121
- I'm cold. I'm just...
- Let's go back home.

697
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, see, I'm freezing.

698
00:47:55,959 --> 00:48:01,381
If I get pumped full of radiation, I should at least
have superpowers or something, you know?

699
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,967
I mean, come on.

700
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,891
Where's...? Where's Sleepy Simon?

701
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,021
Sleepy Simon won the bet.

702
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:24,488
What about the ability to control ants?

703
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:32,120
I thought about that quite a lot, like...
There's 10 trillion ants in the world. Did you know that?

704
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,601
Thank you, baby.

705
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:58,188
No problem, let's get you in bed.

706
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,362
Do you wanna stay?

707
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,616
I can't. I have to... I have homework.

708
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:14,246
I get it. I'm just gonna buzz out of your way.

709
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:29,469
They're from my mom.

710
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:36,185
Every birthday, Christmas, and Thanksgiving
for the last 12 years.

711
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,232
Speaking of parents...

712
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,819
mine wanna meet you.

713
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,241
Izzy?

714
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,828
- Izzy.
- I'm awake.

715
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:59,708
I'm just picturing what an epic disaster that's gonna be.

716
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,670
So count me in.

717
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:20,562
I think you're really gonna like Isabelle, Dad.
She's really awesome. And Phil...

718
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:23,065
Phil is...

719
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:24,316
Right just on time.

720
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:27,110
- Yeah, Dad, let me get this.
- Son, I got it.

721
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,822
I made a casserole.

722
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,326
Which one of you is Isabelle?

723
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:38,997
- Please, come on in.
- It's so nice to meet you, sir.

724
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:42,084
- Please, come in.
- I got you something.

725
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,378
It's small and stupid, but...

726
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:50,300
Thank you. It's Christmas Eve.
I should've gotten something for you, and I didn't.

727
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,636
- And I feel terrible.
- You messed up.

728
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,472
- Yes, I did.
- I must be rubbing off on you.

729
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,685
Thank you.

730
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,979
Let me get this for you.

731
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:05,023
Xavier and I, we went to Wilkinsburg High School,

732
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:08,569
and then we moved
into this tiny, shabby studio apartment

733
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:11,196
about two blocks away from the tap house.

734
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,323
That place is now the Club Mirella,

735
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:16,952
and shield your eyes
for you are gazing upon their headliner.

736
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,830
Oh, no applause, please. Hey, stop that.

737
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:22,916
Nasty girl. I told you, no applause.

738
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:28,255
- Isabelle, you must be very proud of your father.
- I don't have a father.

739
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:33,260
- I'm more of a super-fun au pair.
- Yeah.

740
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,763
Well, you'll have to get us tickets.

741
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,975
- I can't believe you guys are from Wilkinsburg.
- Yes.

742
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:46,273
- Xavier was a janitor, and then he bought the company.
- I believe the proper term is custodial attendant.

743
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:49,151
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- From Wilkinsburg to all this.

744
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:52,529
- That is very inspirational.
- Well, we're very blessed.

745
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:56,992
What we did is we worked hard.
Wilkinsburg is no place to raise a child.

746
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:00,495
Oh, I don't know. You turned out just fine, diva.

747
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:03,498
You're just saying that
because you see the house we live in now.

748
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:07,961
You didn't see the toilets I had to clean,
or the days we went hungry.

749
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,588
It wasn't that bad.

750
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:13,300
Nights sitting in a chair with a broom,
keeping the rats out of Daryn's crib.

751
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:17,387
- I don't remember any of that.
- Good. It's because we made a plan.

752
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,932
But sometimes, bad shit just happens.

753
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:24,520
I mean, some stuff you can't keep away with a broom, right?

754
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:25,521
Apparently not.

755
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,609
You know, I just love these candlesticks.
Are they silver?

756
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,529
Actually, I believe those are pewter.

757
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:38,700
- So, Isabelle, where do you go to school?
- She's homeschooled, actually.

758
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:44,331
- What about college?
- I hadn't given it much thought yet.

759
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:49,211
- Not everybody is destined for higher education.
- I actually couldn't agree more.

760
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:52,965
I think the world could do with a few
less fancy degrees and a few more artists.

761
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:56,218
- Who live in their parents' basements.
- Like half of all college grads?

762
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,806
- Dessert?
- Daryn is destined to do great things.

763
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:06,854
- Maybe he's already doing great things.
- The first steps to any plan is identifying a proper goal.

764
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,814
Harvard undergraduate first.

765
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,692
- Then, Yale Law.
- I just got exhausted even listening to that shit.

766
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,986
Not everybody can be a super-fun au pair.

767
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:17,072
- Maybe that's enough, Xavier.
- Because I'm his father, and he is my son.

768
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:19,199
- Dad.
- We have a responsibility to each other.

769
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:22,578
- He puts his faith in me, and I protect him.
- From what, zombies?

770
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:24,121
- No, from you.
- Excuse you!

771
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,956
- Girls like you, girls your type.
- Dad.

772
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:26,999
- I am so sorry.
- Dad!

773
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:30,127
- ...distraction that you've become in his life.
- Dad, I got waitlisted!

774
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:32,921
Excuse me?

775
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:36,592
- Well, that's not a no, so let's remain positive.
- When did you find this out?

776
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:40,345
- A week or two ago.
- And you're just telling me this now?

777
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:42,431
- I'm sure he had a reason.
- Stop coddling him!

778
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:48,228
Don't you see he's throwing his life away for you?
How can you be this selfish?

779
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:52,524
- I mean, there's no future here.
- Okay, enough. Let's go. We're going.

780
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,527
- I am really sorry.
- Stand up. Here we go, sweetheart.

781
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:56,445
Daryn.

782
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,200
Come here, sweetheart. Easy.

783
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:03,911
- Thank you for the wonderful dinner, Catherine.
- I'm sorry.

784
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,455
And this is mine now, bitch.

785
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,378
I hope you're happy, son.

786
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:58,066
I managed to get us a meeting with James Maxwell.
We have to be perfect in there, son.

787
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:03,197
Don't focus so much on athletic accomplishments,
and make sure to mention Honors Society.

788
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,118
All right, hey, just stick to the script, okay?
Just stick to the script.

789
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:11,788
One foot and then the other.

790
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:16,043
- I see you've been waitlisted.
- Yes, sir.

791
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,087
At least it's not a no.

792
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:23,967
Yeah, yeah, your grades have slipped a little lately.

793
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:28,096
A temporary situation that has been rectified.

794
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:35,812
Honestly, this is just a paper
that tells me what you've done.

795
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:40,400
What I'm really interested in is who you are.

796
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:44,780
Well, I'm captain of the varsity track team.
I'm a member of National Honors Society.

797
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:51,078
And I have the state record in the 5000-meter...

798
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,790
And I have a...

799
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:58,919
...GPA of...

800
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:06,718
Blah, blah, blah.
I'm listing a bunch of bullshit right now.

801
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:07,845
Here's who I am.

802
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:11,515
I might suck at punching people,
but I can get an entire ice cream shop going.

803
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:14,726
I can eat like a person, but I can also be an asshole.

804
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:20,607
I know that greatness requires sacrifice, hard work,
and dedication, but I also know that clouds are for cupids.

805
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,735
And some things you just can't keep away with a broom.

806
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:27,614
And I know that I have to be true to myself
before I can be true to her, but...

807
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,913
she's not here right now.

808
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:39,168
I'm sorry. I've wasted your time, sir. So I'm gonna go.

809
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:44,089
- And nice to see you again, Daryn.
- It's good to see you as well, Mr. Maxwell.

810
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,384
- I gotta go.
- Excuse me for a moment.

811
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,788
How did it go?

812
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,377
Wait!

813
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,131
You're a stupid, selfish child.

814
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:30,093
All this hard work, all this sacrifice, you're just gonna
throw it away for a damn girl?

815
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:34,139
- Her name is Isabelle! She's not just some damn girl!
- Xavier!

816
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,642
- We had a plan!
- You know what I think of that plan?

817
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:38,310
Let me show you what I think!

818
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:40,437
- Hey! Come here!
- Xavier!

819
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,982
- Let me show you what I think about your plan!
- Hey!

820
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:48,195
- I hate your plan!
- What are you doing? Stop it! Stop!

821
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,740
- I've always hated it!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

822
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:54,660
- Stop!
- Hey! Don't you dare!

823
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:00,332
We had a plan, son.

824
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:03,710
- This is what we worked for. This is your dream.
- This is your dream!

825
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:06,338
This is your dream!

826
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,551
You don't even know my dreams!

827
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:16,807
I have always supported you,
but I will not lose my son over this.

828
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:20,143
Daryn?

829
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:28,694
<i>Isabelle.</i>

830
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:32,239
Isabelle!

831
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:37,452
Isabelle.

832
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:39,663
Isabelle!

833
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:43,041
Izzy. Izzy, please, no!

834
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:47,337
I'm done with this! I'm over with it! It's not like before!

835
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,674
I'm so sorry, Izzy. I should have never
let my father treat you like that.

836
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:55,971
I was just so nervous about Harvard, about our future,
about so many things, Izzy,

837
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:59,016
but that was so stupid, and I should have stood up for you.

838
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:02,060
I know that it's too late, but I tore down the plan.

839
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,896
- I'm done with it.
- Hey, shut up!

840
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:05,647
Yo, you shut up!

841
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:07,566
Izzy, don't go! I just...

842
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:12,112
No more milestones, no more pretending,
no more fairy tales and make-believe!

843
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:16,408
None of that! I just... I don't want the life
that we should have had...

844
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:22,748
I just want our life.

845
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:34,593
Get up. Drama queen.

846
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:49,775
One more?

847
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,652
One more.

848
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:52,694
Let's go.

849
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,625
Where are we going, Square?

850
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:12,214
What? Where are you taking me?

851
01:01:14,424 --> 01:01:15,801
We'll see.

852
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:18,262
Oh, mysterious Square.

853
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:20,472
If I tickle you, will you tell me?

854
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:31,275
- See, there's just police. There's police.
- Square!

855
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:35,028
Look, baby.

856
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:39,324
- You can't see anything! We're gonna crash!
- Baby.

857
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:09,980
All right.

858
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:13,692
I think this is all we have.

859
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:16,320
Don't worry. I got this.

860
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:27,623
How you doing?

861
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:43,972
Isabelle! Izzy! Izzy, start the car!

862
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,516
You are insane!

863
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:49,061
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

864
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:52,022
- All right.
- Get back here, you are done!

865
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,857
- Balls, balls, balls!
- You piece of shit!

866
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:55,192
I'm gonna kill you!

867
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:59,071
Oh, my God!

868
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:05,869
Holy shit! Oh, my God, he had a baseball bat!

869
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:10,916
- That was amazing. I am so proud of you, you weirdo.
- All right. That's great.

870
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:14,837
- Okay.
- I can't believe it.

871
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,547
You robbed your first shop.

872
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,840
Oh, my gosh.

873
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:27,201
This is pretty cool, Square.

874
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:57,356
Thank you.

875
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,234
Fire, yo.

876
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:01,902
Oh, my God.

877
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:05,489
- What is that?
- Come on, just take one good guess.

878
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:23,131
- Look.
- Oh, my God... Iz!

879
01:05:23,215 --> 01:05:26,134
- Izzy, what is that?
- It's a baby hedgehog.

880
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:29,304
- You should put it back.
- What are you talking about?

881
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:31,640
His mom's roadkill. He's an orphan.

882
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:33,100
- Okay.
- Poor little guy.

883
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,602
I'm gonna name him Square, after you.

884
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:38,438
Kind of like George Foreman,
when he names all his kids George.

885
01:05:38,522 --> 01:05:41,775
- Yeah.
- Square Jr., meet Papa Square.

886
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:48,115
Whoa, whoa, baby, baby, are you okay?

887
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:50,200
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

888
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:52,536
This is why you shouldn't do drugs.

889
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:55,622
- Oh, I don't feel good.
- Poor Papa Square.

890
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:58,083
What did you do? Eat it?

891
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:14,683
- What was that?
- Nothing. Some idiot just broke a lamp.

892
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,896
Oh, my God, this is insane.

893
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:28,530
- So I think Big Sean's performing here tomorrow.
- We should go.

894
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:33,535
- Maybe this time, we'll actually get to see the show.
- Yeah, that would be a lot of fun.

895
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:49,885
Oh, is it too much? Do I look stupid?

896
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:54,056
No. Not at all. You look absolutely amazing.

897
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:18,580
Hey, wait.

898
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:21,625
It's okay.

899
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:25,045
It's okay, baby.

900
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:32,594
You're so beautiful.

901
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:23,937
This is amazing!

902
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,106
This is so awesome!

903
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:30,068
He's so good.

904
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:35,198
Hey! Look. I made you something.

905
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:39,953
- What's this?
- It's the demo you recorded. I made it all fancy for you.

906
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:42,663
Iz, are you serious?

907
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:46,210
- Listen, you have to give it to Big Sean.
- This is awesome. D... Wait, what?

908
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,921
- All right? Come on, Daryn.
- I can't give this to Big Sean

909
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:52,299
- I'm not joking, all right? You have to do this!
- How?

910
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:55,219
You'll figure it out. Just promise me.

911
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:57,429
- Promise?
- Okay, yeah, I promise.

912
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,640
Okay. Here.

913
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:02,768
- Hey.
- Take Junior. I've got to run, all right?

914
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,853
- Good luck.
- Run where? What are you going?

915
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,648
- Izzy, whatever you're...
- Hey, Hulk Ass!

916
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:09,233
Yeah, you! Remember me?

917
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,359
- How's that shnoz of yours?
- You!

918
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,278
Hey! Come here!

919
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:17,407
- I'll meet you at the car!
- Hey! Stop her!

920
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,667
One foot then the other.

921
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:36,844
Hey, thank you, Philly!

922
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,901
What is that thing?

923
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:56,405
- This is a...
- Yo, is that a hedgehog?

924
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:01,076
Yeah. Yeah, this is Square Jr.

925
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:05,664
Man, he's your biggest fan. I swear
he's got all your albums in chronological order.

926
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,916
- Yo, I gotta get a photo.
- Oh, yeah.

927
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,834
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

928
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:12,421
- You, take the photo of me and the hedgehog.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

929
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:15,257
- That's so cool.
- Totally, right?

930
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,968
- Okay, one, two, three.
- One more.

931
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,094
I love animals.

932
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:21,346
- Put the hedgehog up a little more.
- Yeah, yeah.

933
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:25,225
- No, just... It's all right.
- I do love animals. There you go.

934
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:27,227
- Here you go.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

935
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:28,520
Hi, little guy.

936
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:32,608
- Brian, what happened to your nose, man?
- What?

937
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:35,527
Some big dude jumped me.

938
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:37,779
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

939
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:39,865
You gotta be more careful, man.

940
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,325
Yeah, whatever.

941
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:45,871
- My bodyguard needs a bodyguard.
- I'll protect you!

942
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,999
Yo, yo, is there...?

943
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,640
And then, he's like, "Is that a hedgehog?"
I'm like, "Yeah, this is Square Jr."

944
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,225
He's like, "We have to get a pic."

945
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:07,809
Then the security guard comes back,

946
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:11,104
so I have to hide behind that person
that was taking the picture,

947
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:14,024
And then... And then, he goes.
The security guard leaves again.

948
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:17,694
I gave him the CD.
I was like, "Hey, will you listen to this?"

949
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:20,864
And he was like, "Yeah, sure."
And I was like, "Wow."

950
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:25,452
The fact that he would even take that from a fan,
I was like, "Okay, cool."

951
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:29,831
That was really, really awesome for me,
but maybe he'll actually listen to the CD.

952
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:35,003
You know, maybe in the car on the way home, whatever.
But, you know, that would be really, really cool.

953
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:39,174
Just to hear feedback. I don't know.
I just hope I can meet him again, one day, too.

954
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:42,344
See if he likes it. Regardless...

955
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:52,729
Izzy.

956
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:54,565
Cutie-pie.

957
01:11:55,816 --> 01:11:59,653
- We're here.
- Where?

958
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:02,030
Look.

959
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:07,077
Shit.

960
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:07,995
- Izzy...
- Shit.

961
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:09,913
- Izzy.
- You're an asshole.

962
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:11,707
- Izzy.
- That's my mom.

963
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,542
- That's your mom.
- What is wrong with you?

964
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,502
You're so stupid.

965
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:17,212
Why? Why did you do this?

966
01:12:17,296 --> 01:12:20,299
- I thought...
- I could kill you right now. How did you even find her?

967
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:23,302
The postcards were a start.
But Sammy and Kiran helped a lot.

968
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:27,514
Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill them,
and then, I'm gonna kill you.

969
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:36,273
- She looks old.
- Maybe I'm crazy,

970
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:38,483
- but I think you should go talk to her.
- What?

971
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:42,779
- What am I gonna say?
- I mean, you're Isabelle,

972
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:44,114
you can do anything.

973
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,618
And I'm gonna be right here.

974
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:50,204
Okay?

975
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:59,546
- Balls, balls, balls...
- Balls, balls, balls...

976
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,024
Hi.

977
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:22,945
Isabelle?

978
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:29,785
What are you doing here?

979
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:32,079
Mommy?

980
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:37,417
Go inside. Mommy will be right in
in a minute.

981
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:40,254
Go inside, baby.

982
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,047
Is that you, Amanda?

983
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,215
You have to go.

984
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,134
Please.

985
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:48,679
Mommy, who is that?

986
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:50,681
Come on, baby.

987
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,058
I'll make you a snack, okay? Good girl.

988
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:54,935
Inside.

989
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,281
Let's go.

990
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,246
I didn't...

991
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:16,081
Daryn, please don't, just...

992
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:19,209
- I didn't...
- Stop talking.

993
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:24,381
Izzy...

994
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:29,511
In an interview, Sean says that sometimes
it's not the destination, it's the journey that...

995
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:33,599
Really, Daryn? You are throwing Big Sean
at my face right now?

996
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:34,683
Are you joking?

997
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:37,477
- Are you really doing that, Daryn?
- What's wrong? What did I do?

998
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:39,479
You don't even... I'm so stupid.

999
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:44,109
- I'm so stupid! Why did I do that?
- Izzy!

1000
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:46,570
Calm down! You're gonna hurt yourself.

1001
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:49,656
Don't touch me! Don't ever touch me again!

1002
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,033
You are disgusting.

1003
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:53,285
- You're just like everybody else.
- What did I do?

1004
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:57,039
You promised! You promised and you lied to me!
You're a liar.

1005
01:14:57,122 --> 01:14:59,750
- I lied to you?
- I saw you, Daryn.

1006
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,252
I saw you with Big Sean.

1007
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,299
Why did I trust you? Get me out of the car.
Let me out of the car!

1008
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:09,134
Stop the car, I'm getting out!

1009
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,261
- Get off me.
- What are you doing?

1010
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,430
Let me out of the goddamn car!

1011
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:15,766
- Get me out of this car!
- We're in the middle of a...

1012
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,936
Izzy, watch out!

1013
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,105
Are you okay...?

1014
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:24,525
Isabelle, wait.

1015
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:25,526
Izzy!

1016
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:26,693
Isabelle, wait.

1017
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:27,611
I'm sorry!

1018
01:15:29,196 --> 01:15:30,531
Isabelle.

1019
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:34,159
Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't give it to him.
I lied. All right?

1020
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:39,498
What if he didn't like it? What if he laughed at me?
I chickened out. I'm sorry, Isabelle.

1021
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:47,130
She wanted to be a mom,
but she didn't wanna be my mom.

1022
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:52,469
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

1023
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:54,930
You gotta go. You gotta get away from me...

1024
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:58,308
- Please go.
- There's nothing wrong with you.

1025
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,227
There's nothing wrong with you.

1026
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,230
Izzy! Izzy! Izzy!

1027
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:07,609
What's going on? Izzy!
Somebody help us! Please!

1028
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:10,654
Look, we're at the beach.
Izzy, we're at the beach.

1029
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:14,783
We're here. Look.
We got the sand all around us and everything.

1030
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:18,161
It's just like your dream. It's just like your dream.

1031
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:59,203
The ovarian tumor has metastasized.

1032
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:02,414
It's in her blood. In her organs.

1033
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:06,793
Here's the schedule for her meds.
She's gotta keep to it.

1034
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:08,253
What about chemo?

1035
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:10,422
That's done.

1036
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:13,926
It isn't about treatment anymore.
It's about management.

1037
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:15,636
Managing her pain.

1038
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:17,346
Managing your expectations.

1039
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:19,806
But she wasn't in any pain.

1040
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:23,936
I imagine she was hiding
just how much pain she was in.

1041
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:44,540
So you're leaving?

1042
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:48,669
Call me if you have any questions. I'm sorry.

1043
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,966
Sammy, if you do a grocery run on Wednesday

1044
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,844
that will give me time to clean
while the hospice worker is here.

1045
01:17:56,927 --> 01:18:00,013
Kiran, you're on pharmacy duty.
I'll call in the orders, you pick them up.

1046
01:18:00,097 --> 01:18:00,931
Sure.

1047
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:04,142
- Thank you, guys. I really appreciate it.
- No problem.

1048
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,519
It's mine.

1049
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,022
Why are you still here?

1050
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:22,327
Hey, baby.

1051
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:27,958
The instructions say that you can't take
your medication on an empty stomach.

1052
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,919
So I made some pancakes for you.

1053
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,674
I thought it would be the best...

1054
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:38,051
All right.

1055
01:18:38,135 --> 01:18:39,970
Good thing I made more.

1056
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:41,972
They'll end up on the floor too.

1057
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:47,561
You know what, baby? I love making pancakes.
I almost went to culinary school, okay?

1058
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:51,565
So I'm just gonna do my training in here right now,
just all the blades:

1059
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:54,234
Like I'm a freaking ninja...

1060
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:30,854
So there was this douchebag security guard
and Daryn punched him in the face.

1061
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:34,816
I don't believe you. My baby did not do that.
He is not a fighter.

1062
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,569
I promise you he did.
He was just really bad at it.

1063
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,821
- Mom?
- Good morning.

1064
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,323
What are you doing here?

1065
01:19:41,406 --> 01:19:45,160
Well, a friend gave me VIP tickets to Club Mirella,
and I couldn't resist.

1066
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:46,537
So here I am.

1067
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:50,832
So the three of us have decided
that you really need to take a day off.

1068
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,585
Hang with Sammy and Kiran, do something.

1069
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:56,755
Your mother will take care of Izzy
when I go to work.

1070
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:58,298
I promise I'll be fine.

1071
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:01,385
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1072
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:04,555
- Will you do me one favor though?
- Anything.

1073
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:07,808
You really need to shower. You smell so bad.

1074
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:10,686
- I thought that was me.
- That's enough. Come on.

1075
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:18,443
- Thank you so much for allowing me to come back.
- All good. All good.

1076
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:23,824
- What you got for me?
- Something. But it's rough.

1077
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:25,909
That's more than most people got.

1078
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:09,912
Oh, my God! Isabelle!

1079
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,706
- Oh, my God.
- Mom?

1080
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,792
- She's bleeding from her mouth! Oh, God.
- Izzy!

1081
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:18,170
- Call 911. Call 911 right now!
- Where's my phone?

1082
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:20,756
Let's get you on your side.

1083
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:23,550
Yes, spit it out. Good girl.

1084
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:26,011
- Is she breathing?
- Yes, she's breathing.

1085
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:28,472
Everything's gonna be okay.

1086
01:21:28,555 --> 01:21:32,017
We have an emergency. Yes. 440 Holland...

1087
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,354
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1088
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:38,899
Everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1089
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:51,119
- How is she?
- She's stable. She's resting now.

1090
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:54,665
Isabelle's teratoma has caused fluid to build up
in her abdominal cavity.

1091
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:57,209
Vomiting is a common symptom.

1092
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,794
- Okay.
- Okay.

1093
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:00,212
So, what's next?

1094
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:03,257
- We're gonna adjust her medication.
- And then what?

1095
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,051
- Pardon?
- After you adjust her medication, then what?

1096
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:10,764
- That's all we can do for such a young...
- What do you mean that's all you can do?

1097
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:14,768
This is all we can do for a patient
as advanced as Isabelle.

1098
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:19,273
The cancer has spread through her entire body.
Her organs are shutting down.

1099
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:21,483
It's just a matter of weeks now. Sorry.

1100
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:25,320
Makes no sense at all. That makes no sense.

1101
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:28,824
We need new doctors. We need new everything!
Where is she?

1102
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:30,576
Isabelle! We're going!

1103
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:34,288
We're leaving now because they don't know
what the fuck they're doing in this place!

1104
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:36,874
Izzy! Izzy! Baby!

1105
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:38,208
- Isabelle!
- Daryn.

1106
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:42,546
Isabelle! You'd still be okay right now
if I didn't go anywhere!

1107
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,006
- No!
- Mom! Not right now!

1108
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,549
- Listen to me!
- Not right now!

1109
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,259
Stop it!

1110
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:51,471
She is going to die.

1111
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:54,558
- Why would you say that?
- Because that is the truth!

1112
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:57,644
- Why would you say that?
- Because that is the truth!

1113
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:01,106
That is the truth!

1114
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:04,818
You have done everything that you can do
for her, Daryn.

1115
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:09,531
She's not gonna die! She's not gonna die!
She's not gonna die!

1116
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:11,408
Stop it.

1117
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:15,954
- I can't breathe.
- Stop it.

1118
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:08,090
Hey, baby.

1119
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,009
I have somebody here to see you.

1120
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:13,470
Is it Make A Wish?

1121
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:17,099
Because there's some weird shit I still want.

1122
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:20,102
Iz?

1123
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,971
Iz, please.

1124
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:18,076
Mom.

1125
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:39,765
I'm sorry.

1126
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,977
I'm so, so sorry.

1127
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:51,568
She was ashamed...

1128
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:55,572
and afraid that she would lose her new family.

1129
01:25:55,656 --> 01:26:00,452
That's why she didn't come back
after she got clean.

1130
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:04,289
Why did you make her go?

1131
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:10,128
Because there's some shit
you just don't get to come back from.

1132
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,551
Come on, baby.

1133
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:22,391
But I got to say goodbye.

1134
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:27,354
Thank you.

1135
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:30,816
Close your eyes.

1136
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:45,247
I'll never forget you, Square.

1137
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:22,659
- What's wrong?
- It's okay.

1138
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:24,453
Go back to sleep.

1139
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:01,717
Hey, pretty girl.

1140
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:05,179
I need your help with something.

1141
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,977
Phil told me to drop this off.
Should I just leave it with you?

1142
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,271
I look like a mailbox?

1143
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:15,606
My guy.

1144
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:24,740
What's...? What's going on?

1145
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:26,867
- A wedding is what's going on.
- Really?

1146
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,660
Who's getting married?

1147
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:30,412
You are, brother.

1148
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,999
You guys are hilarious.

1149
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:34,917
Yeah.

1150
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,877
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

1151
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,046
No. Who's actually getting married?

1152
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:41,006
This is your moment.

1153
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,758
Strut.

1154
01:29:46,637 --> 01:29:48,680
Our little boy is all grown up.

1155
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,816
Hi.

1156
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,278
Mom.

1157
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:06,240
- Ron.
- What's up, playa?

1158
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:07,574
What's up?

1159
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:09,076
Look, look.

1160
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:13,705
- Look at that.
- He's so cute.

1161
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,416
- Oh, my God.
- Square Jr., he's adorable.

1162
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:18,919
Where did you guys...?

1163
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:21,129
Isabelle made us look for it.

1164
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:25,801
We found it in the sewer.
Don't worry. We cleaned it.

1165
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:28,220
- Did you clean it?
- Yeah, I cleaned it.

1166
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:31,014
Thank you.

1167
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:03,714
Did you do all of this for me?

1168
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:05,174
I did.

1169
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:07,968
But I thought you said...

1170
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:11,221
Can't a classy bitch change her mind?

1171
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,392
Do you wanna marry me or not, Square?

1172
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:17,477
I do.

1173
01:31:18,687 --> 01:31:20,272
I do.

1174
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:21,481
You better.

1175
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:26,028
Because I'm about to marry the shit out of you.

1176
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:30,490
<i>They say a day to God is a thousand years</i>

1177
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:33,911
<i>And people walk around with a thousand fears</i>

1178
01:31:33,994 --> 01:31:38,123
<i>But the true joy of love
That's why we all are here</i>

1179
01:31:38,207 --> 01:31:41,668
<i>And with a pure heart
You can live life in a year</i>

1180
01:32:06,527 --> 01:32:10,822
From the power vested in me
by the online Internet reverend service,

1181
01:32:10,906 --> 01:32:14,409
I pronounce you man and wife.

1182
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,651
Isabelle?

1183
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:30,777
Isabelle...

1184
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:32,487
Izzy...

1185
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:33,739
Izzy.

1186
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:35,866
Izzy? Isabelle?

1187
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:37,075
Baby.

1188
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:39,536
Baby, are you okay?

1189
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:42,247
- No.
- What do you mean...?

1190
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:44,458
- This...
- What do you need?

1191
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:48,545
This is the last milestone.

1192
01:33:50,881 --> 01:33:54,134
- No. No, baby.
- It's okay.

1193
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:57,846
Your plan worked.

1194
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:05,103
- Izzy...
- You gave me happily ever after.

1195
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:08,857
I know I shouldn't say this...

1196
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:14,071
I love you too, Square.

1197
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:36,593
Isabelle?

1198
01:34:36,677 --> 01:34:38,136
Izzy...

1199
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,141
Izzy.

1200
01:34:43,225 --> 01:34:44,643
Izzy.

1201
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:46,353
Baby. Izzy.

1202
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:47,813
Izzy.

1203
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:53,026
Baby.

1204
01:36:17,736 --> 01:36:19,988
I'm sorry, son.

1205
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:27,287
I'm sorry.

1206
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,228
I'm sorry, man. Funerals suck.

1207
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:56,608
By the way...

1208
01:36:58,777 --> 01:36:59,987
you graduated today.

1209
01:37:02,865 --> 01:37:05,742
I mean, your GPA is kind of in the shitter.

1210
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:07,536
But don't worry. You and Sammy can...

1211
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:10,372
not go to college together. Or something.

1212
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:14,293
Or you could apply to Pitt.
I mean they took me, so...

1213
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:20,841
- Wait, you got into college?
- Yeah.

1214
01:37:20,924 --> 01:37:22,968
- What?
- Yeah.

1215
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:25,095
I brought my grades up and...

1216
01:37:25,179 --> 01:37:28,515
- Don't make it weird, man.
- No. You...

1217
01:37:28,599 --> 01:37:31,185
- You did good, fat boy. You did good.
- Thank you.

1218
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:33,312
You deserve it.

1219
01:37:34,313 --> 01:37:36,773
So, what are you gonna do?

1220
01:37:43,113 --> 01:37:48,869
- Where did you get this rust-bucket?
- Sammy gave me a real good price on it.

1221
01:37:48,952 --> 01:37:52,623
- What are you gonna do when you get to New York?
- Make music.

1222
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:53,790
See what happens.

1223
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:57,085
Well, I got you this.

1224
01:37:59,463 --> 01:38:01,590
Help you to stay organized.

1225
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:04,676
I put a couple of things on your calendar.

1226
01:38:07,137 --> 01:38:08,889
There it is.

1227
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:13,977
- I love you.
- I love you.

1228
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:17,940
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

1229
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:25,697
Are you ready for this?

1230
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:28,909
I thought so.

1231
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:02,526
<i>...never gotten a request quite like this one before,
it comes from a dying girl named Isabelle.</i>

1232
01:39:02,609 --> 01:39:07,197
<i>I'm gonna have to clean some of the language up
because my girl can curse.</i>

1233
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:08,949
<i>So Isabelle writes:</i>

1234
01:39:09,032 --> 01:39:13,579
<i>"Everybody thinks that dying
teaches you something about life,</i>

1235
01:39:13,662 --> 01:39:15,289
<i>but they're wrong.</i>

1236
01:39:16,707 --> 01:39:20,502
<i>The only way to learn about life is by living.</i>

1237
01:39:20,586 --> 01:39:25,382
<i>And I've learned that every moment
is your moment.</i>

1238
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:28,635
<i>Sometimes the moments are messy,</i>

1239
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:30,971
<i>sometimes they're beautiful,</i>

1240
01:39:31,054 --> 01:39:34,808
<i>or scary, or just plain weird.</i>

1241
01:39:34,892 --> 01:39:37,019
<i>But they're all yours.</i>

1242
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:38,896
<i>Cherish them.</i>

1243
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:40,522
<i>Living isn't easy.</i>

1244
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:46,862
<i>But if you can manage to look past your own fears
and everyone else's expectations,</i>

1245
01:39:47,946 --> 01:39:51,450
<i>the reward is your life.</i>

1246
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:52,910
<i>And in my life?</i>

1247
01:39:57,206 --> 01:39:59,208
<i>I was loved.</i>

1248
01:40:01,293 --> 01:40:04,880
<i>So, Daryn, one more?</i>

1249
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:11,595
<i>She also sent me this track and told me
I had to play it or else she would haunt me.</i>

1250
01:40:11,678 --> 01:40:17,267
<i>So here is the world premiere
from local rapper, D Square, "A Life In A Year."</i>

1251
01:40:17,351 --> 01:40:20,437
<i>Yo, Pittsburgh, turn your radios up.</i>

1252
01:40:36,954 --> 01:40:37,788
One more?

1253
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:42,960
One more.

1254
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,960
