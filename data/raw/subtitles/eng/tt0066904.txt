00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:17,131
Wedding in Germany
Fallingbostel, May 1969

2
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:17,584
Dear children, even though your stomachs
are full, you can stand a little speech.

3
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:21,996
Thirty years ago,
when your mother and I married,

4
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:27,882
the sky was blue, but dark clouds
were already looming on the horizon:

5
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,331
the clouds of World War Two.

6
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,997
All of us gathered here today

7
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:48,037
hope with all our hearts
that you be spared such suffering.

8
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:16,666
<i>Clermont-Ferrand: 134,000 residents
in the Puy-de-Dôme region.</i>

9
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:22,632
<i>The capital of Auvergne is 240 miles
from Paris and 37 miles from Vichy,</i>

10
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,922
<i>which was the capital of France
from 1940 to 1944.</i>

11
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:29,916
<i>Gergovie, a nearby Gallic town,
used to be</i>

12
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:33,502
<i>the fortified town of Vercingétorix,
conquered by Julius Caesar.</i>

13
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:37,921
<i>A father tells his children
about a more recent defeat.</i>

14
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,881
In 1939, I was 27 years old.

15
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:49,501
I was the father of a large family,
so I hadn't been sent to the front.

16
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,667
The front was the Maginot Line.

17
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:54,917
I'd been sent to Montferrand,
near Clermont,

18
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,539
and my wife's dairywoman, Mrs Michel,

19
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:02,381
had criticised me
for not going to the front.

20
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,326
So, after the débâcle,

21
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:09,671
I told her that there was no point
in me going to the front,

22
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,747
since the front came to me.

23
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,752
Was there anything other than courage
in the Resistance?

24
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:21,747
Of course. But the two emotions
I experienced the most frequently

25
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,751
were sorrow and pity.

26
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:29,294
<i>The Colonel</i> was <i>from Action Française</i>

27
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,419
The Major was a moderate,

28
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,627
The Captain was all for the diocese,

29
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:39,206
The Lieutenant
couldn't stand the church.

30
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,169
THE SORROW
The adjutant was a fervent extremist

31
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,334
AND THE PITY
The sergeant, a convinced socialist

32
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,501
CHRONICLE OF A FRENCH CITY
The corporal, inscribed on all the lists

33
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:53,377
UNDER THE OCCUPATION
And the private at the bookie's!

34
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:57,134
All these men made
excellent Frenchmen.

35
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,544
Excellent soldiers who march in time.

36
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,129
Thinking that the Republic

37
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:07,754
is still the best thing going.

38
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,379
Now most of these strapping lads

39
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,632
A FILM BY MARCEL OPHULS
don't share the same political views.

40
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,002
But they all agree,
no matter what their view

41
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,667
Part 1: THE COLLAPSE
is just to be left in bloody peace!

42
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:35,036
<i>Two brothers, both local farmers,
live a few miles from Clermont.</i>

43
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:38,581
<i>They have many memories
of German occupation.</i>

44
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,002
<i>Is that your village?</i>

45
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,996
That's where I was born.

46
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,999
I was born near that church there,

47
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:51,746
and later I lived
on the farm facing the school.

48
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,419
You can't help but love your country.

49
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,457
<i>Did you think about it in Buchenwald?</i>

50
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:00,536
Not much.

51
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,382
<i>- You didn't?
- No.</i>

52
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:06,167
- <i>What did you think about?</i>
- <i>Surviving.</i> That's <i>it.</i>

53
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,754
That's mainly what I thought about.

54
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,126
But I'm talking about me,
about how I saw things.

55
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:14,674
I'm not talking about those who...

56
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,787
There were some people who cried.

57
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:24,004
When I saw them cry,
I knew that they would never make it.

58
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:28,211
No way.
You had to think about yourself first,

59
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:30,289
and think about others after.

60
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:35,496
<i>This politician also has
reasons to remember.</i>

61
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:42,786
For me, it was an experience
that I will never forget.

62
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:48,002
This experience may have had
a few secondary effects,

63
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:53,041
but I don't believe it has
affected my attitude or behaviour.

64
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:59,289
<i>Has it not made you feel bitter
towards certain French people?</i>

65
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,879
No, I wouldn't say that.

66
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:07,631
It showed me that there are
certain tendencies and habits,

67
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:11,922
which, when they are fired,
fed, or stimulated,

68
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:17,706
crop up like weeds, and so
we must always be on the defence.

69
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:22,206
We have to protect our youth
from this type of propaganda.

70
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,456
We have to talk to them about it

71
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:29,416
more than we talked about it
a generation or two ago.

72
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:33,627
<i>The manager of the Philips company
also has reasons to remember.</i>

73
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:40,044
As I was saying, his friends would
ask me why I joined the Resistance.

74
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:44,881
Why? Because going into a restaurant
and seeing Germans at a table,

75
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:51,381
and being told there's only four steaks
left for the Germans and none for us

76
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,672
was a little frustrating,

77
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,634
seeing as that steak
came from our cows in Auvergne.

78
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,924
So it was our right to eat it
before giving it away.

79
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,997
That's my first reason.

80
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:10,291
My second reason was that the Germans
were forever imposing curfews.

81
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,789
It was, after all, a Nazi regime,
a totalitarian regime,

82
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,419
no matter how you look at it.

83
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,674
It was worth fighting for,

84
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:23,714
it was even worth dying for,
rather than to live as slaves.

85
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,626
Hence, the Resistance.

86
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,377
Lasting peace is what we need.

87
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,174
There's nothing more senseless
than fighting.

88
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,289
That's what I think.

89
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:42,826
<i>- Depends on what you're fighting for.</i>
- <i>Do you think</i> they really knew?

90
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,536
- <i>They didn't know?</i>
- I doubt <i>it.</i>

91
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,249
There are a few fanatics who know why.

92
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,749
- <i>Did you know why?</i>
- <i>Yes,</i> I <i>did.</i>

93
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,917
- <i>But you weren't</i> a <i>fanatic?</i>
- <i>No, but...</i>

94
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:57,834
But when I went off to war in 1940...

95
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:04,461
I left in 1939, on September 2,
and I was sent to Modane.

96
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,042
What could I have clone?

97
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:14,877
I knew nothing. I was going
to kill guys I'd never seen before,

98
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,916
who had never harmed me.

99
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:22,167
Later, they did harm us when they
arrived in France. They messed us up.

100
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,541
<i>Even in moments of calm,
the soldiers are ready to fight.</i>

101
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:40,379
<i>Faced with the enemy,
they have the winning qualities of</i>

102
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,627
<i>patience, courage,</i>

103
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,961
<i>vigilance, determination,</i>

104
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,166
<i>and confidence.</i>

105
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:54,291
In right-thinking circles,
in high society in Paris,

106
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,419
they sympathised with our soldiers,

107
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:02,794
whose troubles were unfortunately
nothing compared to what came later.

108
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,826
And consequently, during this period,

109
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:12,171
people sought to distract them,
to entertain them,

110
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:17,377
to relieve them from the boredom
of the Maginot Line,

111
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:22,292
where time passed at a snail's pace.
It must've been painfully boring.

112
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:26,754
So the right-thinking women
of the Parisian bourgeoisie

113
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:32,376
decided to form a committee
to entertain our valiant soldiers,

114
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:37,171
to provide them
with a more pleasant view.

115
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:42,214
The idea was to plant rosebushes
on the Maginot Line,

116
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:45,496
to make it look prettier,
to create a nicer atmosphere.

117
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:50,711
And there were people who donated
money towards these rosebushes,

118
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:55,919
so that our soldiers didn't have
to look at the horrid, concrete walls,

119
00:09:56,084 --> 00:10:03,214
and to give them a flowery
environment in which to live.

120
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:10,501
It's pathetic when you think
about the awful things that came later.

121
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,287
<i>The infantry is advancing
at great intervals.</i>

122
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:36,544
<i>In Oisemont, the enemy has set fire
to the tanks of an oil factory.</i>

123
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,081
It took two weeks in Poland.

124
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:53,214
We felt it would be
just as quick in France,

125
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,289
as we were anxious to go home.

126
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:59,462
And,indeed,
we took France in just one month.

127
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,789
<i>...and onwards it goes.
Next stop: Paris.</i>

128
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,379
Naturally,
we attacked on several occasions,

129
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:27,576
but the hardest time was in Oing,
on the Belgian border.

130
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:33,834
The Belgian blockhaus weren't ready,
but we had to take position in them.

131
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:39,036
The Germans arrived equipped with tanks.

132
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,209
All that we had were machine guns.

133
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:48,381
They proceeded to kill everyone inside,

134
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:54,254
because it made such an easy target.
There were no battlements.

135
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,457
They hadn't even
put up reinforced doors.

136
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:00,922
I'm telling you, we walked...
We withdrew,

137
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:05,077
and we must have walked
at least 20 miles,

138
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:09,254
without running across any troops.
Not one single troop.

139
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,829
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

140
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:22,634
First of all, I'd like to emphasise
the fact that the German staff

141
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:29,042
was not expecting to achieve
such a quick, resounding success.

142
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,959
We soldiers, unlike Hitler,

143
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:38,376
were convinced that we were facing
the same adversary as in 1914-1918,

144
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:44,134
a determined, brave adversary,
prepared to fight to the bitter end.

145
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,922
Unfortunately, I must admit
that Hitler was right in this case.

146
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,246
He was always saying
how the French were incapable

147
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:07,576
of repeating their performance
in World War I,

148
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:12,794
and he never missed an opportunity
to add to this statement

149
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:18,002
a few disagreeable and derisory
remarks or comments

150
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:22,171
on the general emotional
and moral state of France.

151
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,579
<i>GERMAN NEW S</i>

152
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,959
<i>Near Noyon, General Stummel,
taking the vanguard with his troops,</i>

153
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,036
<i>with his adjutant,
took several prisoners.</i>

154
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,289
<i>It began with two.</i>

155
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,876
<i>Later, many others surrendered.</i>

156
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:13,882
<i>The prisoners come from every nation
and every walk of life.</i>

157
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,921
<i>So-called defenders of the great nation.</i>

158
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:18,924
<i>In fact, a shame for the white race.</i>

159
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,496
<i>These are the black brothers
of the French.</i>

160
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,879
<i>In the words of Chamberlain,</i>

161
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:05,132
<i>"We, together with our allies,
are the guardians of civilisation."</i>

162
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,922
<i>"Together we fight medieval barbarism."</i>

163
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:11,536
<i>These are the guardians of civilisation.</i>

164
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,004
<i>These are the barbarians.</i>

165
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,127
<i>This is the war
of the Franco-English plutocrats.</i>

166
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:37,292
<i>They began this war rashly without
taking any heed of the consequences,</i>

167
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,539
<i>to fight for the English lords,</i>

168
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,879
<i>not only until the last Frenchman,
but until the last French house.</i>

169
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:56,169
<i>Mrs Tausend, you stayed in Germany.</i>

170
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:00,504
<i>Did you read the papers?
Did you watch the German news?</i>

171
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,674
Yes, we followed the events closely.

172
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,079
Naturally, we were a bit frightened.

173
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,249
But the news of victory made us happy.

174
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,326
<i>These cars are stopped
for a lack of petrol.</i>

175
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:29,041
<i>The Jewish warmongers
and Parisian plutocrats,</i>

176
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:34,247
<i>with their suitcases full of gold
and precious stones, have fled.</i>

177
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:38,746
<i>This shortage of petrol
put a crimp in their plans.</i>

178
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,542
<i>The streets were hopelessly blocked.</i>

179
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,167
<i>Yet these English-loving
traitors and deserters</i>

180
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:49,464
<i>continued their journey on foot.</i>

181
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:02,834
<i>These are the French people
who have been mercilessly evacuated</i>

182
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,001
<i>and dragged along in the flood
of the routed French army.</i>

183
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:11,167
<i>Soon, these people
will be able to go home.</i>

184
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,884
<i>The German people were spared
such a trial,</i>

185
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,501
<i>thanks to the Fuhrer
and his German soldiers.</i>

186
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:34,077
During that time,
there was an enormous upsurge

187
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:38,381
of the people,
who were completely panicked, terrified.

188
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,419
Fate willed that I should be given leave

189
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:45,544
in the last few days
of the month of April.

190
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:50,919
Consequently, I was in Paris in
early May when the Germans invaded.

191
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:58,039
On the roads, people were going mad,
terrified by the bombings.

192
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:01,169
With them, they brought what they could:

193
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:05,504
children, pets, precious objects...

194
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:10,544
Some rode on wagons, others on bicycles.

195
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:15,749
It was a mish-mash of everything
and everyone. It was awful to see.

196
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:18,877
It was all the more awful in that

197
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:23,212
the Germans, in an effort to block
and ruin the roads for the soldiers,

198
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:29,291
didn't hesitate in bombing
these columns of refugees.

199
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,419
As a result,
and I can attest to this fact,

200
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:38,834
there were bodies strewn
all over the place: men, women, horses.

201
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:43,171
Car wrecks sprinkled the roads.
It was a scene from hell.

202
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:49,502
And yet this wave, this flood of people,
continued to move south.

203
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,501
Our impressions? We saw
destroyed villages, burned lands...

204
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,497
It did have a certain effect on us.

205
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:06,962
<i>- And the people on the roads?</i>
- <i>They were fleeing the bad</i> guys.

206
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:13,214
<i>What do you mean?
Weren't you the bad guys?</i>

207
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:25,537
At first, we were seen as the enemy
who was set to destroy the country.

208
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:28,829
Then they began to see
that we just wanted to help,

209
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,956
and that reassured them.

210
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:49,496
The officers or the staff
were clearly out of their depth.

211
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:54,707
Having the trains, the roads,
and all telecommunications cut off

212
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:57,416
led to a situation in which

213
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:03,211
any plans the soldiers had made
were suddenly completely ruined.

214
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:09,461
In addition, certain military circles

215
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,629
shared the attitude of many civilians,

216
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,787
and tackled the war unenthusiastically.

217
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:24,042
After all, they were living in...
I'm not saying they were traitors.

218
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,999
In any case,
there were very few traitors.

219
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:31,327
But this attitude
of preferring Hitler to Léon Blum

220
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:37,584
was an attitude that had become
very popular in bourgeois circles.

221
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:43,834
And this was a circle
to which many of the soldiers belonged.

222
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,252
THE GREAT BATTLE OF FRANCE

223
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,537
<i>On June 14, 1940,
the Germans occupied Paris.</i>

224
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,674
<i>In Clermont, the papers went mad.</i>

225
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,879
Le <i>Moniteur took</i> a <i>stand,</i>

226
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:18,042
<i>asking the people to stand up and fight,
to resist,</i>

227
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,039
<i>to remain free.</i>

228
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:24,132
<i>The owner of this anti-defeatist paper,
Pierre Laval,</i>

229
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:28,629
<i>a deputy for Auvergne, was, at the
same time, preparing for surrender.</i>

230
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,377
<i>The last government
of the Third Republic</i>

231
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,712
<i>slowly moved southwards.</i>

232
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,286
<i>Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting,</i>

233
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,959
<i>but Philippe Pétain was already
taking charge.</i>

234
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:44,076
<i>In Briare,
Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden</i>

235
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:47,211
<i>met with their allies
for the last time.</i>

236
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:52,576
I've always felt
that Reynaud wanted to continue,

237
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,674
that he remained calm and firm.

238
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:58,827
Everyone was
in a very difficult position then.

239
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:04,044
I also believe, and this is something
he told both Churchill and me,

240
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:10,292
that he wasn't very happy having
Pétain as a part of his government.

241
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:15,334
<i>- He 'd foreseen the difficulties?
- Yes, already in Briare.</i>

242
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:21,751
Now, I was a young soldier
in World War I,

243
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:26,667
and for me, Pétain
was the hero of Verdun.

244
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:32,169
But his character had changed.
That's to be expected with age.

245
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:37,206
I'm sure he was opposed to the idea
of your cities being destroyed,

246
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:39,996
because he spoke of it at dinner,

247
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,627
saying, "It's awful seeing
our lovely cities destroyed."

248
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,582
and I had to answer,
“Yes, I understand.

249
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:53,001
"It's hard for an Englishman to say
this, but there are worse things

250
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,081
"than the destruction of cities."

251
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:57,581
But I don't think he was convinced.

252
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,746
We flew over France
at a very low altitude.

253
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,667
<i>- Hedgehopping?
- Yes.</i>

254
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:18,834
In June, there's nothing quite like
the Norman and Breton countryside.

255
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:24,002
And I remember,
as if it only happened yesterday,

256
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:29,461
I remember thinking it was lovely,
but would I ever see it again?

257
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:32,826
And it seemed rather unlikely
that I would.

258
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:38,829
Then the political climate changed
and became unbearable in Bordeaux.

259
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,996
Suddenly, treason was everywhere.

260
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,131
There was a will to surrender,

261
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:51,326
and a desire to get along
with the victors at any price.

262
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:58,461
Anglophobia, ever-present in France,
resurfaced with new vigour,

263
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:03,536
and all this went hand in hand
with a horrible kind of cynicism.

264
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:09,917
The military leaders, the ones who had
messed up, weren't even mentioned.

265
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:15,294
Instead, people blamed
absolutely everything on Léon Blum,

266
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:18,422
the Front Populaire and so forth.

267
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:25,334
And so we consoled ourselves
for the downfall of our nation

268
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:30,751
by getting petty revenge
in matters of internal affairs,

269
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:35,077
a trend which, as you know,
continued long afterwards.

270
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:40,127
<i>On June 16,
the government met in Bordeaux.</i>

271
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:46,082
<i>Paul Reynaud was defeated by
the deputies who refused to leave France</i>

272
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:50,001
<i>and Marshal Pétain became
the head of government.</i>

273
00:24:56,959 --> 00:25:02,169
<i>Adolf Hitler's elite SS troops
have invaded Vichy.</i>

274
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,794
I felt terribly humiliated,

275
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:26,129
as I had been sent on a mission
on an English motorcycle

276
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:32,377
and was heading to Paris, when I saw
the Germans going the other way.

277
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,292
Now, being rather absent-minded,

278
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:39,671
I saw there were some people
following these German troops,

279
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,787
and assumed it was the English.

280
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:47,829
So they were going one way,
and I was going the other.

281
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:50,081
I saw the swastikas on their helmets,

282
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:53,214
and I thought I should go no further.

283
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:07,214
But no one asked me to stop.

284
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:10,916
Everyone was too busy
going their own way.

285
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,254
If I didn't like it, tough.

286
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:19,246
<i>The Resistance in Clermont
was quickly crushed.</i>

287
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:24,249
<i>But the struggle,
albeit subdued, continued.</i>

288
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:28,459
<i>Hitler's SS division
conquered Clermont-Ferrand.</i>

289
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:31,746
<i>German troops occupied
the city for three days.</i>

290
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:37,632
<i>Zepp Dietrich, division commander,
declared victory on the Place de Jaude,</i>

291
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:41,422
<i>as his troops polished their boots
in front of the locals,</i>

292
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:44,084
<i>before heading off to new victories.</i>

293
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:49,291
<i>The Germans didn't return
to Clermont until November 1942.</i>

294
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:53,459
<i>Our aim now is to take
the arms depot in Etienne.</i>

295
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:58,667
<i>An entire infantry regiment has
simply surrendered.</i>

296
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:02,834
At first, I did the same as everyone.
I hadn't understood.

297
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,959
On the morning of June 24,

298
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:12,376
the lieutenant declared that Marshal
Pétain had requested an armistice.

299
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:18,172
I knew what he meant by armistice,
but I wasn't sure about "Marshal."

300
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:23,456
I was never particularly
in favour of Pétain's regime.

301
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:28,674
Nonetheless,
like the other 40 million Frenchmen

302
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:31,134
who experienced that same moment,

303
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:37,377
when I saw the rout, when I saw
that the Germans were in Biarritz,

304
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:41,536
and that France had been
completely invaded,

305
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,632
I thought, like everyone else,

306
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:47,786
"Will anyone be able
to end this massacre?"

307
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:53,539
<i>People of France, as requested
by the President of the Republic,</i>

308
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:59,917
<i>I shall henceforth be the leader
of the French government.</i>

309
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:04,212
<i>Convinced of the affection
of our admirable army,</i>

310
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:09,499
<i>whose heroism stands as testimony
to our long military tradition</i>

311
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,627
<i>as they fight an enemy
which outnumbers them,</i>

312
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,754
<i>convinced that our army's resistance</i>

313
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:20,789
<i>has fulfilled our duty
towards our allies,</i>

314
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:26,166
<i>convinced of the support
pledged by the former soldiers I led,</i>

315
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:29,754
<i>convinced of the French people's
faith in me,</i>

316
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,457
<i>I give France the gift of myself,</i>

317
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,876
<i>to ease its troubles.</i>

318
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:41,421
<i>In these difficult times,
I think of the poor refugees,</i>

319
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:44,924
<i>who, in the depths of despair,
trudge across our roads.</i>

320
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:49,714
<i>I extend my compassion
and concern for them.</i>

321
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:55,922
<i>My heart is heavy as I tell you today
that the fight must end.</i>

322
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:59,496
<i>Last night, I spoke with our adversary</i>

323
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:04,707
<i>and asked if they were prepared
to help me, between soldiers,</i>

324
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,826
<i>after the fight, with honour intact,</i>

325
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:11,131
<i>to find a way to end the hostilities.</i>

326
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:17,207
<i>From the Fuhrer headquarters
a historical piece of news:</i>

327
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:22,286
<i>The prime minister of the new
French government, Marshal Pétain,</i>

328
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,539
<i>has declared,
in a broadcast to the French people,</i>

329
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:28,829
<i>that France should lay down its arms.</i>

330
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,884
Of course, I was happy to hear we'd won.

331
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:29,129
The defeat gave me the same feeling
I would get when I played rugby.

332
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:34,462
I don't like losing,
especially when it's 60 to O.

333
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,539
I hate drawn-out defeats.

334
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,459
<i>This stone is a reminder</i>

335
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:43,376
<i>of the humiliation of Germany
on November 11, 1918.</i>

336
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,877
<i>Is it true</i>

337
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:56,172
<i>that France had given England
its word of honour</i>

338
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:59,634
<i>that it wouldn't agree
to a separate truce?</i>

339
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:05,712
I think we... That was before
I was a member of government.

340
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:08,829
I think we had reached an agreement

341
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:12,996
whereby neither party
would cease fighting.

342
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,957
<i>- Without the other party's consent.
- Right.</i>

343
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,246
But we didn't discuss that at all

344
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:22,381
when Churchill and I were there,

345
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:26,536
because we accepted
the position France had taken.

346
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:31,579
<i>- In Briare, he said...
- That he'd accept an armistice?</i>

347
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:36,671
No, he said we accepted the fact
that you may not be able to go on.

348
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:39,884
Nothing was said about an armistice.

349
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:45,134
<i>It's clear that between a ceasefire and
an armistice, there's a big difference.</i>

350
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:46,332
Exactly.

351
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:52,584
He simply said, "We understand
that you cannot go on any longer."

352
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:55,706
That was clear.

353
00:31:55,876 --> 00:32:00,326
The question was quite simply,
"What are you going to do?"

354
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,921
I even sent Churchill a short letter
after we returned from Briare,

355
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,174
which has since been published,

356
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:11,174
saying that we must make
a clear distinction.

357
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:14,464
If the French can no longer fight,
that's one thing.

358
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:18,629
But if they make it easy for the enemy,
that's another.

359
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:25,754
<i>La Madeleine. Early today in Paris,
the Fuhrer made an unexpected visit.</i>

360
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:30,827
<i>During his tour of Paris,
he also visited this building.</i>

361
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:00,001
<i>Place de Ia Concorde.</i>

362
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:07,172
<i>The Arc de Triomphe.</i>

363
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:28,709
<i>Trocadéro.</i>

364
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:39,579
<i>A look at the Eiffel Tower.</i>

365
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,957
<i>On the Fuhrer's left, Professor Speer.</i>

366
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:54,286
One thing we should remember

367
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:57,419
is that when France
agreed to an armistice,

368
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,924
even though we didn't want to lose,

369
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:02,634
how many Frenchmen said,

370
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:06,962
"It's well that ends well.
So much the better."

371
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:12,001
As for Marshal Pétain,
he knew what he was doing in Vichy.

372
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:16,327
In every canton and every town,

373
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:19,464
he formed what was called
the French Legion.

374
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:23,456
- <i>The Legion of Companions.</i>
- <i>It</i> was <i>meant for</i> us <i>veterans</i>

375
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,706
who'd fought in World War I.

376
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:29,456
Everyone, except me, went on Sundays.

377
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:32,996
I'm the only one
who never set foot in there.

378
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:34,924
It's true.

379
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:40,134
They would attend the raising
of the colours on the market place

380
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:44,462
every Sunday, wearing their hammer
and francisc. No, not hammer.

381
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:48,629
I don't mean the hammer and sickle.
What was it called again?

382
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,577
- <i>The sword.</i>
- Whatever.

383
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:54,882
They'd all been given a beret.
Can you imagine?

384
00:34:55,917 --> 00:35:00,827
Of course, I never set foot there.
Not on your life.

385
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:04,416
But when I saw what happened,
I understood.

386
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:06,754
<i>So suddenly, this old marshal</i>

387
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:12,084
<i>suggests an armistice
with French honour intact and so forth.</i>

388
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:17,334
<i>As a young Frenchman,
do you feel the defeat was justified?</i>

389
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:19,331
<i>Does it not disgust you?</i>

390
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:24,921
No, defeat was the inevitable
consequence of French politics.

391
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:30,294
In fact, this was the theme
propagated by the Vichy government.

392
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:36,382
If we were defeated, they claimed,

393
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:41,752
it was because for so many years,
we had to put up with party politics,

394
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:44,881
which is the reason
France is in this situation today.

395
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,996
<i>How did that phrase go?</i>

396
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:52,171
<i>"The parties which have
harmed us so much..."</i>

397
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:55,134
It was... No, that's not it.

398
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:59,172
- <i>Something</i> about lies.
<i>- The lies that harmed us.</i>

399
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:03,334
Right. "I hate the lies
that have harmed us so much."

400
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:09,706
<i>At the same time, there was
another appeal launched by de Gaulle,</i>

401
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:14,916
<i>an appeal which apparently
very few people in France heard.</i>

402
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:18,004
I certainly didn't hear it.

403
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,169
<i>But as a pilot,
weren't you slightly tempted to...</i>

404
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:27,334
<i>I imagine that a certain number of
people in the same unit as you</i>

405
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:30,541
<i>chose to "continue the struggle,"
as they said.</i>

406
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,789
There weren't many who did.

407
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,882
Let's get it straight.

408
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:41,126
It's true that some people
attempted to flee to North Africa.

409
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:45,462
Later, the situation stabilised.
Not so many fled.

410
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,787
<i>Did it ever cross your mind to flee?</i>

411
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:52,629
Of course.
But I didn't think about it for long.

412
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:58,884
My father quickly made me understand

413
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:06,626
that Marshal Pétain guaranteed
a new order, renewed honour, etc.

414
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:34,084
<i>The victor of Verdun guaranteed
France's honour</i>

415
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,001
<i>and the establishment of a new order.</i>

416
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:42,376
<i>This seemed not only desirable,
but necessary, to many Frenchmen.</i>

417
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,537
<i>They respected
and had faith in the Marshal.</i>

418
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:50,709
<i>In Clermont, the spirit of renewal
filled Pierre Laval's Le Moniteur.</i>

419
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:55,917
<i>Editorials sought those responsible
for defeat and found them.</i>

420
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:57,834
<i>"Let's be French.</i>

421
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:01,131
<i>"Too much foreign influence
has led to many problems."</i>

422
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:04,294
<i>On June 26, 1940,
in the magistrate's court,</i>

423
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:08,709
<i>René Mons was sentenced
to three months in jail for defeatism.</i>

424
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:10,126
<i>Editorial.</i>

425
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:15,752
<i>We demand those responsible be tried
and an analysis of our problems ensue.</i>

426
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:21,327
<i>This quickly led to xenophobia,
Anglophobia and anti-Semitism.</i>

427
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,077
<i>Gaining French nationality
became harder.</i>

428
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:27,212
<i>Vichy came out with the decree:</i>

429
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:30,286
<i>"The French elite must be restored."</i>

430
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,579
<i>On that day, July 29, 1940,</i>

431
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:35,541
<i>Clermont butcher Antoine Labronne
was tried</i>

432
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:39,879
<i>and given a large fine
for having sold rotting ham.</i>

433
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:47,957
<i>Did you ever speak about
what the papers said back then?</i>

434
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,996
<i>- Never.
- Never?</i>

435
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,667
We were totally cut off from the world,

436
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:57,884
because there was one value
that we all shared,

437
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,422
and that was caution.

438
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:03,504
We didn't know what the butcher thought,
or the milkman,

439
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,787
or the engineer or the intellectual.
We had no idea.

440
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:10,669
Like everyone else,
we stayed on our guard.

441
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:14,714
<i>What do you think
people's main concern was back then?</i>

442
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:16,376
Food.

443
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,037
<i>That took up most of your time?</i>

444
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:24,169
Definitely.
Animals were illicitly butchered.

445
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:27,384
One needed a bit of meat to survive.

446
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:31,577
As you know,
the French are very good at cheating.

447
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:35,832
One had to have a bit more bread
than the usual ration,

448
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:40,464
or a bit more tobacco
by smiling nicely at the tobacconist.

449
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,416
A bit more of everything.

450
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:48,504
So every weekend, a regular parade
of cyclists would go for supplies.

451
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:54,044
They had devised a system
based on tickets, on ration cards.

452
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,132
Personally, I was a smoker,

453
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:59,246
and it was awful not having cigarettes.

454
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:01,331
It was a horrible situation.

455
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:04,464
People would do anything, even steal.

456
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:10,709
I got so desperate that I even rolled
artichoke leaves and smoked them.

457
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:14,879
The children who were born
during that time,

458
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:16,956
between 1942 and 1944,

459
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:22,169
should have suffered from rickets,
and I say this as a doctor.

460
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:25,287
In our family, it was ironic.

461
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,422
These young ladies have a brother,

462
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:32,424
who is 27 years old,
and was born in 1942.

463
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:35,504
He's six foot one!

464
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:40,329
We fed him so much to avoid rickets
that he turned into a giant.

465
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:45,077
He's a great tennis player,
an architect, and a giant to boot.

466
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:51,881
<i>Are you what they call "a bourgeois"
in a large provincial town?</i>

467
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:56,536
If being bourgeois means
eating properly, hunting in the Sologne,

468
00:40:56,709 --> 00:41:00,419
having a hunting ground
in Sanscoin and in Sérye,

469
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:04,419
and a son-in-law
who owns Lake Mont-Cinére,

470
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,384
then I'm a bourgeois.

471
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:10,964
<i>When did you first begin to experience</i>

472
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:16,956
<i>the consequences of the times,
in other words, persecution?</i>

473
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:20,496
<i>How did you feel about that?
Did anything happen?</i>

474
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:23,132
Not before 1942.

475
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:26,746
The only extraordinary event
that occurred

476
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,747
is that before the children were born,

477
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,997
once again,

478
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:40,292
in September 1942,
the hunting season was re-opened.

479
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,084
<i>What an event.</i>

480
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,497
It was important to the hunters.

481
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:51,752
Game had been untouched for two years
so there was an abundance of it.

482
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:56,877
It was a very satisfying experience
for those who owned a gun.

483
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:10,331
<i>In their little nests in the backyard,
my little rabbits are so sweet.</i>

484
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:12,421
<i>Until recently, I hated hutches,</i>

485
00:42:12,584 --> 00:42:16,754
<i>and I despised and insulted
our gentle little friends,</i>

486
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:19,707
<i>now the centre of our attention.</i>

487
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:21,786
<i>Just think, a rabbit!</i>

488
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,039
<i>Firstly, it will delight the cook.</i>

489
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:29,039
<i>and as its skin dries in the wind,
the whole family rejoices.</i>

490
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:33,131
<i>Follow my example
and give rabbit breeding a try.</i>

491
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:39,287
<i>As you can see, I love, you love,
we all love rabbits in every form!</i>

492
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:42,039
In reality, the French

493
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,752
aren't normally
very involved in politics.

494
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:51,127
Once in a blue moon, they decide
to take action and storm the Bastille,

495
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:54,246
or to fight religious wars for 50 years,

496
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:59,461
or to initiate the French Revolution,
or to set off to conquer Europe.

497
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:04,496
But, normally speaking, they're
just as peaceable as anyone else.

498
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,787
One thing is for sure:
the French, in general,

499
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:14,079
like a peaceful regime,
a regime which has authority,

500
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:15,961
but is preferably humane.

501
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:20,286
In any case,
they feel the need to be protected.

502
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,382
They're quite paternalistic.

503
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:25,332
<i>Does this explains Pétain's popularity?</i>

504
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:30,711
Definitely. I might add that,
as a sergeant in the French army,

505
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:35,576
I've seen a routed army.
and it's not a pretty sight.

506
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:42,167
There's no denying that, for some time,
Pétain was extremely popular.

507
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:47,377
He was viewed as one of
the good old guys, perhaps a bit senile,

508
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,042
but after all,
he had given himself to France.

509
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:55,539
That was a clever way of putting it.
He gave the gift of himself.

510
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:59,879
So everyone thought that an old guy
like him couldn't do any harm.

511
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:03,882
He could only help France.
At his age, what harm could he do?

512
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:11,332
These arguments, albeit feeble,
were how people justified Pétain.

513
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:15,084
THE MARSHAL'S VISIT

514
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:49,542
<i>When we went
all over the world,</i>

515
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:52,539
<i>we were dying to get
back on the train.</i>

516
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:55,754
<i>Our nose on the window,
we open the door</i>

517
00:44:55,917 --> 00:45:00,577
<i>and embrace everything
like good bread.</i>

518
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:04,377
<i>The old bell tower
in the setting sun.</i>

519
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:07,672
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

520
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:10,674
<i>Those big meadows
with their wild flowers.</i>

521
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,964
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

522
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:16,786
<i>This little garden sign,
"Beware of clogs".</i>

523
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:20,209
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

524
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:26,376
<i>At each station stop
you catch the words:</i>

525
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:29,712
<i>"All aboard
for the Paris Express"</i>

526
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:32,666
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

527
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:36,212
<i>And oh so gently,
life starts again,</i>

528
00:45:36,376 --> 00:45:39,496
<i>You'd promised yourself
to swallow it all.</i>

529
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:42,287
<i>But these blue dreams,
these gigantic projects,</i>

530
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:47,456
<i>for a few days
we let them slide.</i>

531
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:51,166
<i>This pretty brunette
with heavenly eyes.</i>

532
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:54,674
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

533
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:58,214
<i>The betting office
which shuts at noon.</i>

534
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,246
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

535
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:04,417
<i>Running a tab at the little bar.</i>

536
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:07,424
<i>Oh, France smells so good!</i>

537
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:14,004
<i>It's Saturday, lie back,
no worries till Monday,</i>

538
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:17,127
<i>A game of Belote or Dix de Der.</i>

539
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:20,582
<i>Oh, the country smells good!
Which country?</i>

540
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:24,291
<i>Our country smells so good,
of course!</i>

541
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,919
I missed Mers-el-Kébir.

542
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,214
I only heard about what happened
two weeks later.

543
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:41,172
I never understood Mers-el-Kébir.

544
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:46,544
Even now, having read many books
on the subject of Mers-el-Kébir,

545
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,632
I still don't understand.

546
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:52,789
It was always a mystery to me.

547
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:55,922
Mers-el-Kébir was a mystery indeed.

548
00:46:56,084 --> 00:47:02,004
<i>Do you mean you don't understand
why the English did what they did?</i>

549
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:05,287
No, I never really
understood the English.

550
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:11,004
After leaving Churchill,
I was a member in the House of Commons,

551
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:15,212
I went to the House of Commons,
got my car,

552
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:19,879
and drove myself through Hyde Park.

553
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:25,167
In the middle of the park,
I saw a group of French sailors,

554
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:29,294
with their little red pompoms
on their képis.

555
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:36,544
They were running and playing
with an equal number of girls,

556
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:40,714
or "young ladies" rather.

557
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:44,881
They were running
and playing and screaming.

558
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:50,076
They couldn't understand a word
of what the other was saying.

559
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:53,541
Then a horrible feeling swept over me.

560
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:58,251
It was sheer luck
that I didn't crash the car,

561
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:04,667
because suddenly I remembered
Churchill's ultimatum I'd just read,

562
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:08,827
and I thought of those French boats
in Mers-el-Kébir,

563
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,924
where there were other sailors,

564
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:15,924
also wearing képis
with little red pompoms,

565
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:19,666
and I wondered what was going
to happen to them tomorrow.

566
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:38,169
<i>These are the victims of the most base
and loathsome attack ever.</i>

567
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:54,667
<i>Clearly, France's former ally only
attacks those who cannot fight back.</i>

568
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,789
<i>On the morning of the attack,</i>

569
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,922
<i>Admiral Gensoul received
the English ultimatum.</i>

570
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:05,077
<i>Admiral Somerville proceeded
to send several delegations,</i>

571
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:10,831
<i>in order to explain to Gensoul
the options proposed by Churchill:</i>

572
00:49:11,334 --> 00:49:15,504
<i>they could join the Free French,
allow themselves to be disarmed,</i>

573
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:20,497
<i>or head to a neutral port
which was out of German reach.</i>

574
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,669
<i>Admiral Gensoul refused
all three options,</i>

575
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:28,004
<i>as he considered them
dishonourable solutions.</i>

576
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:36,329
What we didn't dare to risk happening

577
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:40,504
was letting the boats
fall into enemy hands.

578
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:42,581
We simply couldn't take the risk.

579
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,792
<i>But wasn't there also
a psychological risk?</i>

580
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:00,289
Yes, a considerable risk.

581
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:04,464
<i>It allowed the Germans
to spread propaganda.</i>

582
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:09,504
And Vichy, too.
Lord knows they used the opportunity.

583
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:12,787
I think we understood that,
but at the time,

584
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,922
we had very little choice in the matter.

585
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,922
There were 1,600 sailors

586
00:50:21,126 --> 00:50:24,246
killed by the British Navy.

587
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:28,247
The British Navy attempted
to take over the French Navy.

588
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:31,327
That was clear to us at the time.

589
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,582
We thought that...

590
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:39,461
We believed the armistice
would be respected by the Germans.

591
00:50:39,626 --> 00:50:44,036
In France, we thought,
as the Vichy government had told us,

592
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:49,674
that the French Navy would
never be given over to the Germans.

593
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:51,174
For us, that was a fact.

594
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:55,504
I was brought up to believe
that promises were kept,

595
00:50:55,667 --> 00:51:00,537
and I just couldn't imagine
that there could be political dealings

596
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:05,209
that would eventually lead
to the French Navy being given away.

597
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,789
There was no way.

598
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:10,381
So we viewed it as a brutal attack.

599
00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:14,076
<i>There was also
an additional moral problem,</i>

600
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:17,381
<i>in that, according to many testimonies,</i>

601
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:23,462
<i>the sailors whose boats were shelled
by the British</i>

602
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:27,786
<i>believed at that moment
they were going to cast off</i>

603
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,789
<i>in order to join the British fleet.</i>

604
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:35,502
That's terrible.

605
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:41,326
Had we felt there was any hope of that,
we would never have attacked.

606
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:43,881
But there was no hope.

607
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:48,462
Everything we said about the Germans

608
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:52,416
was proved in Bizerta,

609
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:58,792
where the Germans proceeded to give
the French admiral

610
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:00,829
twenty minutes to surrender,

611
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:05,286
to surrender boats and all,

612
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:09,462
on pain of an immediate bombing attack,

613
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,706
or of being taken prisoner.

614
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:18,669
Our predictions all came true.

615
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,964
We knew who we were dealing with.

616
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:36,174
It was then, shortly after these events,

617
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:42,214
that the French, whose faith in
the English had been greatly shaken,

618
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:47,706
made contact with us for the first time,
through General Huntziger

619
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,916
at the Armistice Commission
in Wiesbaden,

620
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:55,214
to discuss the possibility
of changing the armistice clauses

621
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:58,326
to allow military collaboration.

622
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:15,922
And it was the discussion
of such options,

623
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:21,127
for which each side undoubtedly
had its own personal motivations,

624
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:25,287
that initiated the negotiations,

625
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:28,422
which are now known as "collaboration."

626
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:40,922
While the talks were beginning,

627
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:46,127
Hitler and Pétain agreed
to meet in Montoire.

628
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:13,212
In our first meeting,
Laval told me he was a Germanophile.

629
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,289
And as he had known me for years,

630
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:20,499
he asked me to put in a good word
for him with Hitler, and I did.

631
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:27,632
I think Hitler felt Laval was sincere,

632
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:30,922
at least in one aspect:
when he spoke of collaboration.

633
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:37,174
And that was the main issue
at the second meeting.

634
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:46,496
In such cases, the defeated want to know
what will become of them.

635
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,714
What will the peace treaty be like?

636
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:53,829
Whereas the victors I've often seen

637
00:54:54,334 --> 00:55:00,334
generally don't know what's next
and cannot answer such questions.

638
00:55:06,334 --> 00:55:08,424
That's how it went in Montoire.

639
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:12,044
Hitler didn't know
how to answer Pétain's questions

640
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:16,289
about boundaries
or the fate of prisoners.

641
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:19,879
So it ended with
everything up in the air.

642
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:24,037
Ah, Montoire...
Now that was quite a story.

643
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:27,174
Where was this Montoire, anyhow?

644
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:32,379
Everyone was looking it up in the atlas
to see where it was.

645
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:36,536
When we heard what had transpired,
it was depressing.

646
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,632
Some even cried the next day.

647
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:40,542
<i>- People were crying?
- Yes.</i>

648
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:44,499
Soon afterwards,
a new slogan became popular,

649
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:46,956
"Collaboration is..."

650
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:51,131
"Give me your watch,
I'll give you the time."

651
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:52,499
That was the slogan.

652
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,332
That was collaboration.

653
00:55:57,376 --> 00:56:01,536
He often said, also in my presence,

654
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:04,674
that he hadn't yet decided

655
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:08,827
whether England or France
should pay for the war.

656
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:13,004
On the basis of his "race ideology,"

657
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:18,211
or whatever you can
call this point of view,

658
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:23,419
many felt much more related
to the English than to the French.

659
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:29,667
I am convinced that France,
as Hitler saw it,

660
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:32,787
could only play a minor role

661
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:36,962
in a National Socialist Europe.

662
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:44,249
He had never been in France
or anywhere else in Europe.

663
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:49,461
Whatever knowledge he had
was derived from books,

664
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:54,669
which had first been adapted
to his point of view.

665
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:59,877
In his mind, he felt that
a decline of the French people

666
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:10,292
was unavoidable, and this idea
was confirmed by the French defeat.

667
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:24,287
<i>During his travels, Hitler sometimes
shared his thoughts with others.</i>

668
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:27,626
<i>April 5, 1942. Suppertime.</i>

669
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:32,002
<i>The Fuhrer says that if one plans on
ignoring the terms of a contract,</i>

670
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:34,707
<i>no use quibbling over details.</i>

671
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:39,286
<i>Hence, we must assure ourselves
that the French are sincere.</i>

672
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:44,669
<i>No point in trying to pickpocket
an experienced pickpocket</i>

673
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:46,584
<i>like the Fuhrer himself.</i>

674
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:50,921
<i>In any case,
France's main task for the next 50 years</i>

675
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:55,077
<i>is to repair the damage
done at Versailles.</i>

676
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:58,214
<i>April 24, 1942. Suppertime.</i>

677
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:02,379
<i>The Fuhrer says he is against
marriages between</i>

678
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:05,496
<i>the Wehrmacht and foreigners
in occupied lands.</i>

679
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:09,671
<i>Such demands are generally based on
sexual frustration,</i>

680
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,747
<i>which is common in troops abroad.</i>

681
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:17,667
<i>He is struck by the contrast
between the photos of the German men,</i>

682
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:21,134
<i>and those of the women,
who are very shabby looking.</i>

683
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:26,172
<i>The Fuhrer feels that such marriages
are doomed from the start,</i>

684
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:30,504
<i>both in terms of individual happiness
and racial purity.</i>

685
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:34,497
<i>He is more in favour
of harmless passing fancies,</i>

686
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:37,787
<i>which are inevitable
in this type of situation.</i>

687
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:53,421
The conditions created by
National Socialism

688
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:56,537
within German structures at that time

689
00:58:56,542 --> 00:59:02,792
made it impossible for us to respect
the clauses of the armistice.

690
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:08,832
We couldn't help what happened,

691
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:13,212
any more than we could have helped
all the other horrible things

692
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:17,379
which continue to haunt
any rational human being.

693
00:59:17,376 --> 00:59:23,626
We couldn't stop Hitler and company
from invading Alsace and Lorraine,

694
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,706
making them a part of the Third Reich,

695
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:32,376
and eventually incorporating their youth
into the Wehrmacht.

696
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:36,996
This was all out of our hands.

697
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:40,917
We can reproach ourselves
until kingdom come,

698
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:43,424
but there was nothing we could do.

699
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:27,167
<i>You say that after Russia, you were
sent to Alsace, and then France.</i>

700
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,709
<i>Why? Was Alsace not France?</i>

701
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:42,252
No. For us, it wasn't French territory.
The people were pro-German.

702
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,457
I even brought my whole family.

703
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:54,004
There were some people
with bad intentions,

704
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:57,207
some patriots who were ready
to do anything.

705
01:00:57,376 --> 01:00:59,076
But there weren't many.

706
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:03,381
So I felt like
I was in a country of German origin.

707
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:11,794
<i>And now?</i>

708
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,039
I've never gone back.

709
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:18,044
<i>No, but what do you think of it now?</i>

710
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:22,379
I think it's true.
I think it belongs to Germany.

711
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:26,542
<i>Here a show is being put on for the SS.</i>

712
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:29,666
<i>Bruno Fritz's amusing ice hockey report.</i>

713
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:43,924
The German player is taken by surprise
and falls down on...

714
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,957
...on the ice!

715
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:57,791
He stands up again. It feels too cold.

716
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:17,421
<i>Thanks to Franco-German
economic collaboration,</i>

717
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:20,714
<i>100,000 French workers now work
in Germany.</i>

718
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:23,829
<i>Four trains leave the capital weekly</i>

719
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:25,924
<i>and head for German industrial regions.</i>

720
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:29,924
<i>Today, at the Gare du Nord,
the war councillor Michel</i>

721
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:35,294
<i>has come to shake the hand of worker
number 110,000: Edouard Lefebvre.</i>

722
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:40,334
<i>Tell us, Mr Lefebvre,
were you unemployed?</i>

723
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,581
- That's right.
- <i>For how long?</i>

724
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,706
It's been two years now.

725
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,829
<i>- Are you married?</i>
- With <i>children.</i>

726
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:59,632
<i>This vast organisation has already had
good results:</i>

727
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:04,462
<i>Lower unemployment rates,
and understanding between workers.</i>

728
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:17,827
I'd worked for the Finance Minister
and the State Secretary since 1923.

729
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:23,211
In 1940, Mr Lansfried requested
that I go to Paris,

730
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:28,419
as head of the military-controlled
finance division in occupied France.

731
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:33,627
He didn't want a National Socialist
party member in this position.

732
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:39,881
<i>Were you not a member of the party?</i>

733
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:50,666
Yes, shortly before,
I had joined the party,

734
01:03:50,834 --> 01:03:53,424
again at the request of Mr Lansfried.

735
01:03:54,459 --> 01:04:00,709
We tried to be as reasonable as
possible, and as fair as possible,

736
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:04,879
not only in our own interests,
but in those of France as well.

737
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:16,172
<i>This famous democracy,
in the past 20 years,</i>

738
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:20,504
<i>has proved itself incapable
of eliminating such poverty.</i>

739
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:34,036
<i>The Third Reich, however,
aims to provide its workers</i>

740
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:38,212
<i>everywhere in Germany
with healthy and beautiful hometowns.</i>

741
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:42,379
<i>This is a new settlement
in a small industrial town,</i>

742
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:46,381
<i>which naturally has a daycare centre,</i>

743
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:51,582
<i>a clinic, a centre for mothers
and children and an X-Ray lab.</i>

744
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:55,921
One gets the impression
from such reports

745
01:04:55,917 --> 01:05:02,167
that German propaganda was
quite open in its racial prejudice,

746
01:05:02,334 --> 01:05:05,754
and often implied
that German discipline and structure

747
01:05:05,917 --> 01:05:10,327
were necessary qualities to clean up
what was considered

748
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:12,251
to be "the French mess“.

749
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:25,079
Yes, there is some truth
in what you say.

750
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:31,334
In our offices in Paris,
we also had a propaganda department.

751
01:05:31,334 --> 01:05:34,464
But it received orders
directly from Berlin.

752
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:45,749
And I would like to point out that,
from the outset of my job...

753
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:52,167
It was the first ministerial-level
visit from the French government,

754
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:55,287
the Minister of Transport
visited in September 1940.

755
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:59,462
He was accompanied
by the owner of a racing stable,

756
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:03,629
who wanted permission
to begin horse racing again,

757
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:08,826
as it was a very popular
national pastime.

758
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:20,289
<i>The races are ever-popular.</i>

759
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:24,462
<i>One thing is clear,
Paris has become Paris once again.</i>

760
01:06:33,834 --> 01:06:38,004
I listened to my collaborators
and said, "Why not?"

761
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:43,207
And so the races started up again,
and continued until 1944.

762
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:24,707
Thanks to us, the theatres were able
to open their doors again.

763
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:27,826
We often went to the theatre,
alone or with friends.

764
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:31,131
The Germans also attended the races,

765
01:07:31,126 --> 01:07:36,326
which is how the different parties
made contact quite spontaneously.

766
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:41,544
Personal relationships developed
between the different sides,

767
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,632
probably for various reasons.

768
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:53,424
<i>I'm sure you're aware there has been
a tendency in France since the war</i>

769
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:57,002
<i>to deny that such contact ever existed.</i>

770
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,247
Yes, but it did exist.

771
01:08:01,334 --> 01:08:06,544
Germany was triumphant,
and there wasn't a single front

772
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:09,672
from which it failed
to come home victorious.

773
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:14,877
There's no denying that the German army
made quite an impression

774
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:19,082
on the youth in France.
Seeing that army of young men,

775
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:20,922
stripped to the waist...

776
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:27,376
After all, I'm the son of a soldier
and I was a soldier myself.

777
01:08:27,376 --> 01:08:32,576
Sense of responsibility,
hierarchy and discipline mean a lot.

778
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:38,826
A well-disciplined army was important
to people like us.

779
01:08:39,751 --> 01:08:43,881
This was the first time
we had seen such an ideal army.

780
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:47,172
The French army was nothing compared to

781
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:53,419
this army who could put
the fear of God into an entire people.

782
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:58,626
It sounds awful to say,
but it's the truth of the matter.

783
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:02,789
We solemnly swear

784
01:09:04,626 --> 01:09:05,916
to unite

785
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:09,787
and to place our forces,

786
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:14,004
our faith,

787
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:16,166
our ardour,

788
01:09:17,376 --> 01:09:19,456
at the service of the Marshal,

789
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,174
at the service of France.

790
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:30,751
<i>This campfire draws
a three-day meeting to an end,</i>

791
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:34,917
<i>during which the discipline
and dedication of these young men</i>

792
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:38,214
<i>were proved once again.</i>

793
01:09:54,876 --> 01:10:00,076
The French believe servicemen
should be tough as nails,

794
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:05,292
and at the end of the day,
they always turn to servicemen,

795
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:11,384
whether it be to restore order,
to prevent a coup-d'état,

796
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,632
or to organise a coup-d'état.

797
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,581
But the serviceman is omnipresent,

798
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:19,881
with his cap, his pompom, his sabre,

799
01:10:20,292 --> 01:10:24,042
no matter what his rank may be.

800
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:27,174
The French love their army.

801
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:35,964
VICHY, <i>APRIL</i> 1969
<i>Poem by Officer C. Languillon,</i>

802
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:41,286
<i>published on the front page of
Le Moniteur on November 24, 1940.</i>

803
01:10:41,459 --> 01:10:43,669
<i>"His name rings as a gun shot.</i>

804
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:48,134
<i>"Pétain ready for the challenge?
The soul is willing.</i>

805
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:50,962
<i>"But goodness is ever aloof.</i>

806
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:54,076
<i>"The great victor,
even greater in defeat.</i>

807
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:57,381
<i>"Schemers, foreigners,
buffoons and fools,</i>

808
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:01,542
<i>"have brought you
to your knees, O France.</i>

809
01:11:01,709 --> 01:11:04,499
<i>"The hero of Verdun,
cleaning the slate,</i>

810
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:07,627
<i>"Is setting our house in order
from top to bottom.</i>

811
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:11,792
<i>"A Herculean labour,
a difficult recovery.</i>

812
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:14,919
<i>"From the ruins come muffled groans.</i>

813
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:18,214
<i>"Former profiteers
writhe in the rubble."</i>

814
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:31,752
Pétain, in a series of speeches,
drew conclusions from this defeat,

815
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:36,542
and he did so with skill.
He could woo his audience.

816
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:41,129
If one was to read the texts now,
I haven't read them in years,

817
01:11:43,209 --> 01:11:47,379
but I bet if you read them now,
you would be quite surprised.

818
01:11:47,876 --> 01:11:53,626
<i>Yes, the texts relied heavily
on the people's collective unconscious.</i>

819
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,542
Absolutely right.

820
01:11:55,709 --> 01:12:01,959
- <i>He blamed the parliament.</i>
- <i>Yes, the parliamentary system...</i>

821
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:09,081
Certain employers were
suspect... foreign...

822
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:13,171
<i>- Cosmopolitan...
- ...not to mention dark-skinned.</i>

823
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:16,377
And, of course,
he blamed the Communist Party.

824
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:20,212
The Communist Party was the cause
of all evils.

825
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:22,497
All hotels were requisitioned,

826
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:29,791
and the Hôtel du Parc was occupied
by Marshal Pétain and his staff.

827
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:36,924
This is where I met my friend, Colonel
de Gorostarzu, who lived with Pétain.

828
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:42,294
He was the chief of staff
for his aviation department.

829
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:48,537
Consequently,
I was often at the Hôtel du Parc.

830
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:55,827
It was always busy,
with lots of people milling around.

831
01:12:56,001 --> 01:13:01,921
Everyone kept their voices down
and spied on their neighbours.

832
01:13:02,084 --> 01:13:05,214
Personally, I wasn't
used to their system,

833
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:09,214
but when I spoke,
I followed everyone's example.

834
01:13:09,376 --> 01:13:12,706
They were forever shushing one another.

835
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:20,829
- <i>Everyone</i> was very <i>suspicious.</i>
- <i>Of the enemy or of one another?</i>

836
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:25,004
A bit of both.

837
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:28,752
<i>Are you a Republican?</i>

838
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:33,332
Not really.

839
01:13:35,126 --> 01:13:36,286
- <i>Not really?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

840
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,379
<i>You're more of a Monarchist?</i>

841
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:40,462
Yes, that's right.

842
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:42,536
<i>French news, late 1940.</i>

843
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:47,379
<i>Pilot-sergeant Gontier de Vasse,
veteran of WWI,</i>

844
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:49,832
<i>volunteer in '39, hurt in Dunkirk,</i>

845
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:54,001
<i>has, of his own free will, agreed
to make the following declaration:</i>

846
01:13:54,167 --> 01:14:00,247
Ever since my return from England
aboard <i>The Sphinx</i> on October 5,

847
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:05,167
I've been surprised by the number
of my compatriots who still believe

848
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:10,834
the wounded in Narvik and Dunkirk
were all well-treated by our ex-ally.

849
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:16,044
And this is why I've decided
to share my memories with you.

850
01:14:17,084 --> 01:14:19,174
When we arrived in England,

851
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:23,334
we harboured no grudge
against our English comrades.

852
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:26,456
But after the tragedy in June,

853
01:14:26,626 --> 01:14:29,576
when we were invited
to come and serve under a new flag,

854
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:34,632
when they offered
to pay us our dues in pounds sterling,

855
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:38,962
we could only reply
with disdain and indignation.

856
01:14:38,959 --> 01:14:43,129
We French soldiers can only serve
under our own colours.

857
01:14:43,126 --> 01:14:45,206
Anything else would be treason.

858
01:14:45,209 --> 01:14:48,329
Fellow Frenchmen, comrades,

859
01:14:48,334 --> 01:14:53,544
our duty is to stand side by side
behind our leader, Marshal Pétain,

860
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:57,707
to guarantee France a place of honour
in a new Europe,

861
01:14:58,292 --> 01:15:01,882
and to allow the prisoners
to return home immediately.

862
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:03,791
It is a difficult task.

863
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:07,079
Those who try to divide us are enemies.

864
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:10,214
United we stand, divided we fall.

865
01:15:11,251 --> 01:15:15,541
The idea was to get out of the war,
come what may,

866
01:15:15,876 --> 01:15:18,376
as quickly as possible.

867
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:23,752
There were 15,000 French sailors
in Liverpool.

868
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,882
I went and spoke to them.

869
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:30,884
I tried to persuade them
to continue the war.

870
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:33,132
But there was no way.

871
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:40,246
We were so low on people
that we needed them to dig the trenches,

872
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:43,537
and we offered them wages to do so.

873
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:44,999
They said no.

874
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,829
They said,
"France is no longer in the war.

875
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:57,079
"We no longer have the right
to dig trenches."

876
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:03,331
You see...
the kind of attitude they had.

877
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:10,627
Their desire to get out
was almost spiteful.

878
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:20,002
As for what would become of England,
they didn't give a care.

879
01:16:26,251 --> 01:16:29,381
That's the kind of attitude they had.

880
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:32,497
They felt that it was inconceivable

881
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:38,747
that the English succeed
where the French army had been beaten.

882
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:43,786
<i>On June 17, 1940,
the steam liner Le</i> Massilia,

883
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:46,579
<i>headed from Bordeaux to Morocco.</i>

884
01:16:46,751 --> 01:16:49,671
<i>Several parliamentarians were aboard.</i>

885
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:52,127
<i>This event caused much ink to flow.</i>

886
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:58,002
I boarded <i>Le</i> Massilia without
suspecting that it was a big trap.

887
01:16:59,584 --> 01:17:03,754
Those who stayed behind in Bordeaux
quickly understood

888
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:10,002
that they could exploit
the circumstances,

889
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:16,252
and influence the public
to think that the departure of the boat

890
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:20,421
and the fact that
a number of politicians were aboard,

891
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:25,627
was a sign we were panicking,
running away, abandoning them.

892
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:28,746
In other words, deserting.

893
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:34,787
The people aboard <i>Le</i> Massilia
who actually wanted to fight

894
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:40,211
were quickly judged to be cowards
who were fleeing the fight.

895
01:17:41,251 --> 01:17:44,631
It was paradoxical that some of us,

896
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,542
including [Pierre] Viénot,
Jean Zay, [Alex] Wiltzer and I,

897
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:51,419
were tried for desertion,

898
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:57,167
when in fact their original plan
had been to go and fight.

899
01:17:57,334 --> 01:18:01,794
And as far as I was concerned,
I was almost obliged to go,

900
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:06,382
seeing as my unit had gone,
and it was my duty to follow them.

901
01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:11,206
Everyone wound up in Rabat.
There were tons of people.

902
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:18,294
Once there, I went to lunch

903
01:18:18,751 --> 01:18:23,291
at "Balima", Rabat's best restaurant,
where everyone met.

904
01:18:23,459 --> 01:18:28,789
One of my cousins,
Du Jonchay, a pilot, was there,

905
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:32,287
and naturally we discussed
what had happened.

906
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:35,249
He showed me Pierre Mendés-France,

907
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:41,667
who was sitting at a table
with a lovely woman, who was his wife.

908
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:45,831
My cousin turned to me and said,

909
01:18:46,876 --> 01:18:51,036
"Our State Secretary there
is responsible for our defeat."

910
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:57,499
There he sat, our little lieutenant,
drinking champagne.

911
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:01,077
That champagne completely infuriated me.

912
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:02,326
I walked up to him,

913
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:08,751
and told him this was no attitude
to have, after being defeated,

914
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:11,879
drinking champagne in public
as if he was delighted

915
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:16,039
about what had happened.

916
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:18,424
<i>Then what?</i>

917
01:19:18,834 --> 01:19:21,254
I told him

918
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:25,422
if I saw him again,
I would kick him out.

919
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:29,329
And I gave him my card.

920
01:19:30,626 --> 01:19:35,626
- <i>It</i> caused quite a stir.
- <i>You were picking</i> a <i>fight.</i>

921
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:39,882
No, I simply gave him my card
to let him know who I was.

922
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:42,082
Not to hide my identity.

923
01:19:42,251 --> 01:19:44,001
<i>How did he react?</i>

924
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:49,997
He got up, stood to attention,
and said nothing.

925
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:53,127
I was a captain, he was a lieutenant.

926
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:55,002
<i>I SEE.</i>

927
01:19:55,626 --> 01:19:57,706
There was surrender and treason.

928
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:02,746
But anti-Semitism had also begun
to rear its ugly head.

929
01:20:02,917 --> 01:20:07,957
Many who used to hide their feelings
openly declared their anti-Semitism

930
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:13,326
to the point that France began adopting
certain German values,

931
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:17,504
and sought to get closer to Hitler,

932
01:20:17,501 --> 01:20:22,711
in the hope of creating a Europe where
France and Germany would collaborate

933
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:26,879
and obviously anti-Semitism
became a common element

934
01:20:26,876 --> 01:20:29,996
between many Germans and Frenchmen.

935
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:35,211
And, of course, Jean Zay and I
had the misfortune of being Jewish.

936
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:40,419
Actually, I was Jewish.
Jean Zay was only partly Jewish.

937
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:45,627
He had converted, as had his father,
but he was of Jewish origin.

938
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:50,827
This didn't detract from
the atrocious campaign against him,

939
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:55,004
which, as you know,
ended in his being killed.

940
01:20:57,084 --> 01:21:01,254
Jean Zay was arrested.
His pregnant wife was in Casablanca.

941
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:05,422
She had a very tough time
to find a hospital bed,

942
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:09,577
or even someone
willing to help her give birth.

943
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:11,674
There was such hatred.

944
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:16,877
When clinics or hospitals heard
that she was Jean Zay's wife,

945
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:20,882
they didn't have
the courage to admit her.

946
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:25,212
You can't imagine how rampant
sectarianism had become.

947
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:32,331
In any case, Mrs Zay's pregnancy
was certainly a very trying time.

948
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:37,791
She lived with my wife
and they spent many long hours together

949
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,669
during which they were
abused and insulted.

950
01:21:40,834 --> 01:21:46,044
My wife also had
a very rough time of it.

951
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:47,082
Anyhow,

952
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:54,377
Madeleine Zay eventually gave birth
to this baby,

953
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,456
whom I had the opportunity to meet,

954
01:21:56,626 --> 01:22:00,376
as I was arrested
shortly after the baby's birth,

955
01:22:00,626 --> 01:22:04,626
and when I was transferred
to Clermont-Ferrand,

956
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:08,962
where I met up with Jean Zay,
I'd seen his daughter and he hadn't.

957
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:13,497
JEAN ZAY
To Appear in Court Tomorrow

958
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:26,501
The committing magistrate was
Colonel Leprêtre.

959
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:32,457
I don't want to name names, but
this man's reputation lives on today.

960
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:38,956
The man was very intelligent,
very bright, clever and cunning,

961
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:43,327
but he had a very perverse side to him,

962
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:46,291
in that he harboured great hate
for the accused,

963
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:50,079
especially if the accused was left-wing.

964
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:56,206
He got a certain morbid pleasure
from seeing an important man accused.

965
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:04,959
Even outside of cross-examination,
he would sometimes visit the prison,

966
01:23:05,209 --> 01:23:09,379
just to sit and chat with the prisoners.

967
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:13,252
He would go in their cells,
and sit on their beds,

968
01:23:13,459 --> 01:23:15,459
pretending to speak with them simply.

969
01:23:15,626 --> 01:23:20,576
He clearly got a great deal of pleasure
out of holding the fates

970
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:23,791
of such formerly important men
in his hands.

971
01:23:23,959 --> 01:23:28,129
There was something very sick,
very odd about it.

972
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,542
A strange man.

973
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:35,749
<i>So he would confess to certain things
in moments of relaxation?</i>

974
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:39,537
One day, he said to me,
"I know what you think of me."

975
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:43,579
The man was bright enough to understand.
Very intelligent.

976
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:46,881
He said to me,
"I know what you think of me,

977
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:52,077
"but in an organised society,
there are certain tasks,

978
01:23:52,084 --> 01:23:57,294
"tasks which must be done,
and which require people to do them."

979
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:02,714
"Every society needs bin men."
He chose that word.

980
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:04,416
<i>Were you able to emphasise</i>

981
01:24:04,584 --> 01:24:10,834
<i>the racial and political background
and motives to the trial?</i>

982
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:16,921
No, our main concern was
to obtain satisfying results,

983
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:23,004
and we knew that these judges
wouldn't appreciate such arguments.

984
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:26,287
Even if we had said that
his being Jewish

985
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:28,539
should have nothing to do
with the trial,

986
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:34,039
we knew perfectly well
that it would be a major issue.

987
01:24:34,209 --> 01:24:36,709
The hearing was extremely tense.

988
01:24:36,876 --> 01:24:40,876
It began at 9am with an introduction
by Pierre Mendés-France,

989
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:45,252
which the Colonel received
with obvious contempt.

990
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:49,212
He had been given a table
and a jug of water.

991
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:53,876
He began with the following
introductory statement:

992
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:58,082
"Colonel and gentlemen,
I am Jewish, I am a Freemason,

993
01:24:58,251 --> 01:25:01,081
"but I am not a deserter.
May the trial begin."

994
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:07,081
The court was presided over
by a rather frenzied man,

995
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:09,831
called Colonel Perret,

996
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:13,999
a colonel in charge of tanks,

997
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:18,456
who harboured a particular hatred
for General de Gaulle,

998
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:25,834
because they had served in Saint Cyr
together and were both competitive.

999
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:32,076
He hated anything to do with de Gaulle,
Gaullism or Gaullists.

1000
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:36,081
Furthermore,
he was a very frenzied character,

1001
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:40,421
who ran the hearings
in an atrocious manner.

1002
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:47,289
My sentence was nothing compared to
the death sentences he gave out.

1003
01:25:47,459 --> 01:25:52,749
He was responsible for executions,
which is considerably worse

1004
01:25:52,917 --> 01:25:56,327
than the sentence he gave me.

1005
01:25:56,584 --> 01:26:02,964
I must say that those present
at the hearing were extremely hostile.

1006
01:26:03,126 --> 01:26:06,826
The audience had been rigged,
no two ways about it.

1007
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:10,037
Women whose faces were filled with hate.

1008
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:12,132
I won't name any names,

1009
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:15,079
but they were hateful people,

1010
01:26:15,251 --> 01:26:20,291
people who were hoping
for the cruellest of sentences,

1011
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:23,579
who were hoping
I'd be killed immediately,

1012
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:27,751
who didn't think I should even
be allowed to defend myself.

1013
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:33,001
Some 300 or 400 entry cards
had been delivered,

1014
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,377
but only six were for the defence.

1015
01:26:35,626 --> 01:26:38,206
The cards were quite a story.

1016
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:43,416
As only a limited number existed,
and they were in high demand,

1017
01:26:43,584 --> 01:26:45,504
a new black market developed.

1018
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:50,537
There were bistros in Clermont
that hawked the cards.

1019
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:55,036
Flatteringly enough,
they were very expensive,

1020
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:58,499
twenty francs for the show.
It cost more than the cinema.

1021
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:03,207
There's no denying that
public opinion was strongly influenced

1022
01:27:03,376 --> 01:27:05,456
by the papers at that time,

1023
01:27:05,459 --> 01:27:09,629
which felt that the politicians
who were accused

1024
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,582
should automatically be declared guilty.

1025
01:27:12,751 --> 01:27:16,921
My colonel, my lieutenant-colonel
and my general

1026
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:21,077
all took the stand
and said, "He didn't desert."

1027
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:26,131
When the commissioner,
whose name I won't give either,

1028
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:29,422
stood up and announced in a choked voice

1029
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:33,577
that he was sentenced
to six years for desertion,

1030
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:37,581
Mendés told him,
"Sir, I'm sure you'll be rewarded.

1031
01:27:37,751 --> 01:27:40,211
"You've served the master well."

1032
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:45,996
Former State Secretary Sentenced
to Six Years in Jail for Desertion

1033
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:52,327
I don't know if Rochat told you
that a man came to see him the next day.

1034
01:27:53,376 --> 01:27:57,536
And this man told him,
"I'm a Pétain supporter,

1035
01:27:57,542 --> 01:28:01,712
"and I am appalled by what happened
yesterday. It's scandalous.

1036
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:06,919
"The Marshal must not be aware
that such things are happening.

1037
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:11,077
"The Marshal must be informed
of such goings-on.

1038
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:18,377
"I saw you stenograph the hearing."
Which indeed he had.

1039
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:24,037
"Could you get a copy for me
to bring to the Marshal himself?"

1040
01:28:24,626 --> 01:28:29,826
Rochat gave him a copy
which he took to the Marshal.

1041
01:28:29,834 --> 01:28:31,924
Naturally, nothing ever came of it.

1042
01:28:32,084 --> 01:28:37,294
But the man who took the copy
was a certain Mr Giscard d'Estaing.

1043
01:28:40,251 --> 01:28:44,421
<i>It is these children,
the pupils of French schools,</i>

1044
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:48,417
<i>in whom the Marshal sees hope
for our country.</i>

1045
01:28:48,584 --> 01:28:51,544
<i>He has come to speak simply,
as only he can,</i>

1046
01:28:51,709 --> 01:28:54,829
<i>in a modest school
in the town of Périgny.</i>

1047
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:56,916
You may sit down now.

1048
01:28:57,251 --> 01:28:59,791
You don't have to stand to listen.

1049
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:07,334
Young pupils of our French schools,

1050
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,786
the reason I wanted
to speak to you today

1051
01:29:11,959 --> 01:29:15,669
on this day
as you begin a new school year,

1052
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:20,877
is that it's important for you
to know that I am counting on you

1053
01:29:21,084 --> 01:29:24,884
to help me rebuild our country, France.

1054
01:29:25,042 --> 01:29:28,172
So work hard, stand firm,
and do your best.

1055
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:30,539
All rise.

1056
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:36,286
To arms, citizens!

1057
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:40,037
Form your batallions!

1058
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:44,669
We march, we march!

1059
01:29:44,834 --> 01:29:52,884
Let impure blood water our furrows!

1060
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:56,132
I had to pass through Vichy
to reach my posting in Billancourt

1061
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:59,422
in the first two weeks of August 1940.

1062
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:02,537
Many people told me
that Marshal Pétain was very tired,

1063
01:30:03,584 --> 01:30:05,674
and was only lucid
for two hours a day.

1064
01:30:07,251 --> 01:30:09,831
Imagine my surprise when I met this man,

1065
01:30:10,334 --> 01:30:13,834
who, although elderly,
stood bolt upright,

1066
01:30:14,001 --> 01:30:19,791
with his look of steel,
which many people have commented on,

1067
01:30:19,959 --> 01:30:23,209
and with the greatest of ease,

1068
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:28,576
politely asked me to sit down
and make myself comfortable,

1069
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:33,581
then said, "Mr Lamirand,
there's been much talk about you here."

1070
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:38,577
<i>The secretary general of youth,
Mr Georges Lamirand</i>

1071
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:43,001
<i>recently visited Lavalette camp,
the main goal of which</i>

1072
01:30:43,167 --> 01:30:47,167
<i>is to train the men of tomorrow.
He visited these young men</i>

1073
01:30:47,334 --> 01:30:50,464
<i>who are united by a common ideal,
and live life</i>

1074
01:30:50,959 --> 01:30:54,629
<i>in continual contact with nature,
work and simplicity,</i>

1075
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:58,417
<i>these values upon which
we must rebuild our country.</i>

1076
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:01,924
We talked and I thought to myself,

1077
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:03,997
"What bad luck.

1078
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:09,037
"They say he's only lucid two hours
a clay, and I chance upon those."

1079
01:31:09,209 --> 01:31:12,329
The problems of youth are fascinating,

1080
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:15,292
but I had absolutely no idea that,

1081
01:31:15,459 --> 01:31:21,169
in the position
Marshal Pétain wanted to grant me,

1082
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:25,674
there were so many fascinating
subjects and problems to solve.

1083
01:31:25,876 --> 01:31:28,996
Repeat after me: Long live France!

1084
01:31:30,042 --> 01:31:32,132
Long live the Marshal!

1085
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:40,464
Louis Renault finally agreed
to give me leave,

1086
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:46,711
saying to Pétain,
"I'll lend him to you for a month."

1087
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:50,879
and Marshal Pétain,
in his infinite cleverness,

1088
01:31:50,876 --> 01:31:52,956
"Fine, one month.

1089
01:31:52,959 --> 01:31:57,129
"But if you don't mind,
let's make the job renewable."

1090
01:31:57,126 --> 01:31:59,206
and he renewed it 30 months.

1091
01:31:59,376 --> 01:32:01,666
<i>Mr Lamirand is inaugurating</i>

1092
01:32:01,834 --> 01:32:06,504
<i>an exhibition of drawings
sent to Pétain by French schoolchildren.</i>

1093
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:11,542
<i>The little ones wanted
to answer the Marshal's call,</i>

1094
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:16,749
<i>they wanted to show the Marshal
their towns, villages and homes,</i>

1095
01:32:16,917 --> 01:32:20,877
<i>hence sharing a piece
of their daily lives with him.</i>

1096
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:25,082
<i>A school girl, perhaps the youngest
in France, had the luck</i>

1097
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:30,291
<i>of being allowed to give Pétain
her lovingly written letter in person.</i>

1098
01:32:30,459 --> 01:32:33,579
It was about adding a new element

1099
01:32:33,584 --> 01:32:40,884
to the famous triptych of the time:
Work, Family, Nation.

1100
01:32:41,042 --> 01:32:44,632
Honour your work, your family,
and your nation.

1101
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:47,132
<i>A national revolution?</i>

1102
01:32:47,626 --> 01:32:48,876
You said it.

1103
01:32:49,209 --> 01:32:53,379
Marshal Pétain has already told you
several times

1104
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:56,496
what he meant by social revolution.

1105
01:32:56,501 --> 01:33:01,711
He feels that our
social system is unfair.

1106
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:04,829
There is too much poverty,
too much injustice.

1107
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:07,791
And that is what he wants to change.

1108
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:13,169
He is bound and determined
to bring happiness to France,

1109
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:17,327
and asks us all
to join in a communal effort.

1110
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:21,081
Dear friends, this is
his social revolution.

1111
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:24,631
That was when he started
planning his escape.

1112
01:33:25,126 --> 01:33:28,626
He grew his beard, shaved it off,
grew it out again,

1113
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:30,832
and one fine clay, he left.

1114
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:47,541
I must admit I'm not very athletic,

1115
01:33:48,209 --> 01:33:52,749
but I prepared myself by working out
for several months beforehand.

1116
01:33:53,209 --> 01:33:56,749
I was high up,
so I had to jump off a high wall.

1117
01:33:56,917 --> 01:33:58,997
But I had to run the risk.

1118
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:03,167
And once I had jumped,
I would be a free man again.

1119
01:34:03,584 --> 01:34:06,134
Just as I was about to jump...

1120
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:09,422
There were trees planted
along the avenue.

1121
01:34:10,459 --> 01:34:14,629
I heard the unexpected sound of voices.

1122
01:34:14,626 --> 01:34:17,746
I tried to see in the semi-darkness.

1123
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:21,922
There was a couple sitting under a tree.

1124
01:34:22,959 --> 01:34:25,039
You can imagine
what they were discussing.

1125
01:34:26,084 --> 01:34:31,294
He knew what he wanted,
but she hadn't decided yet.

1126
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:35,464
It seemed to last an eternity to me.

1127
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:38,581
She ended up saying yes,

1128
01:34:38,584 --> 01:34:43,794
but I had the impression she had
put up a great deal of resistance.

1129
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:48,996
Finally, they left, and so I jumped.

1130
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:55,252
And let me assure you
that I was even happier than he was.

1131
01:34:56,292 --> 01:35:00,462
I'd really like to meet him some clay
and let him know

1132
01:35:01,126 --> 01:35:05,496
how much I experienced
with the two of them that night.

1133
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:08,627
<i>How you admired his audacity.</i>

1134
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:14,002
Yes, and how her lack of audacity
struck me as being so untimely.

1135
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:16,081
Anyway,

1136
01:35:16,251 --> 01:35:20,251
love, fate and escape
eventually won the day.

1137
01:35:22,334 --> 01:35:24,424
<i>Did you disguise yourself?</i>

1138
01:35:25,459 --> 01:35:28,579
I was disguised, but not very well.

1139
01:35:29,626 --> 01:35:31,706
You see, many people back then

1140
01:35:31,709 --> 01:35:36,919
who wanted to disguise themselves
would let their beards grow.

1141
01:35:37,084 --> 01:35:40,884
So, bearded men
automatically aroused suspicion!

1142
01:35:41,084 --> 01:35:43,174
I let my moustache grow,

1143
01:35:43,167 --> 01:35:50,457
I gave myself a new hairstyle,
parted straight down the middle.

1144
01:35:50,459 --> 01:35:52,539
I got a pair of glasses.

1145
01:35:53,584 --> 01:35:56,544
And of course, I changed
the way I dressed and so forth.

1146
01:35:56,959 --> 01:36:01,749
The next day,
I went for my daily visit with him,

1147
01:36:01,917 --> 01:36:03,997
to see if he had escaped or not.

1148
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:09,037
I arrived and saw all these people
with decametres in hand,

1149
01:36:09,209 --> 01:36:13,379
taking all sorts of measurements.
They were hysterical.

1150
01:36:13,376 --> 01:36:16,496
They asked me what I wanted.
I said I was there to see my client.

1151
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:21,537
They asked if I knew Pierre
Mendés-France had left. I said no.

1152
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:24,829
I burst out laughing,
which made them angry.

1153
01:36:24,834 --> 01:36:30,044
They carried out a huge security check
of all the roads and trains.

1154
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:36,131
But my plan was to not contact anyone,
to not count on anyone,

1155
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:40,462
to be cut off from
everything and everyone.

1156
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:45,502
I must say that life
in France at that time

1157
01:36:45,667 --> 01:36:50,207
is very difficult to imagine,
and even more so to describe.

1158
01:36:50,376 --> 01:36:53,826
You had an old pair of shoes
you hoped would last.

1159
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:57,131
If they got a hole,
there was no leather to fix them.

1160
01:36:57,792 --> 01:37:01,582
There were no plates, there were
no matches, there was nothing.

1161
01:37:03,876 --> 01:37:09,456
It is very difficult,
in hindsight, to describe

1162
01:37:09,626 --> 01:37:12,746
what it was like living in a country

1163
01:37:12,917 --> 01:37:16,327
where everyone was always
searching for everything.

1164
01:37:17,959 --> 01:37:21,959
<i>The new rage in Paris
is silk stockings without the silk.</i>

1165
01:37:22,126 --> 01:37:26,126
<i>All you have to do, ladies,
is dye your legs.</i>

1166
01:37:26,292 --> 01:37:29,212
<i>It's easy and practical, a great idea.</i>

1167
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:33,247
<i>The ladies are trading in
their garters for paintbrushes.</i>

1168
01:37:34,626 --> 01:37:37,576
<i>Worried about what will happen
when you bathe?</i>

1169
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:41,751
<i>No problem.
Paint-on stockings are waterproof.</i>

1170
01:37:41,917 --> 01:37:46,707
<i>On top of that, Elizabeth Arden
guarantees they won't run!</i>

1171
01:37:56,501 --> 01:38:00,001
<i>That's a Parisian habit
which will disappear.</i>

1172
01:38:03,834 --> 01:38:06,924
<i>Where is France headed?
Where is Europe headed?</i>

1173
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:10,419
<i>Some 3,000 people in Chaillot will hear</i>

1174
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:15,377
<i>Mr Alphonse de Chateaubriant
discuss The French Drama.</i>

1175
01:38:16,209 --> 01:38:20,459
At this very moment,
a huge continental unit

1176
01:38:20,917 --> 01:38:23,577
is slowly taking shape.

1177
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:28,786
It will be one gigantic
geographical piece in the puzzle,

1178
01:38:28,792 --> 01:38:32,962
with one single political
and economical doctrine,

1179
01:38:32,959 --> 01:38:36,079
stretching to the very tip of Europe,

1180
01:38:36,084 --> 01:38:40,254
the very tip of which is France.

1181
01:38:41,292 --> 01:38:46,502
Therein the importance of France
becomes clear,

1182
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:52,752
as France becomes,
in this new division, the outer edge,

1183
01:38:53,209 --> 01:38:59,879
the last bastion on the Atlantic
of this immense continent,

1184
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:05,252
faced with another large continent,
America,

1185
01:39:06,292 --> 01:39:10,462
which is ready to take over
the ancient order of things,

1186
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:14,461
the ancient riches
and capitalist creeds,

1187
01:39:14,626 --> 01:39:18,786
the ancient gold and the ancient man,

1188
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:21,922
in order to make it their last refuge,

1189
01:39:21,917 --> 01:39:25,037
their last fortress,

1190
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,132
and their last army.

1191
01:39:28,167 --> 01:39:32,327
I sincerely hope
that everything I have said tonight

1192
01:39:33,126 --> 01:39:39,076
will give the word "collaboration"
new meaning in your eyes.

1193
01:39:39,626 --> 01:39:42,746
It's not surprising that, at first,

1194
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:46,921
such poison won over many new converts.

1195
01:39:47,959 --> 01:39:52,129
Little by little, people began
to realise it was propaganda,

1196
01:39:52,126 --> 01:39:58,376
and to see that
the government was practicing a policy,

1197
01:39:58,376 --> 01:40:01,496
which they themselves called
collaboration with the enemy.

1198
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:05,671
Slowly but surely,
people began to open their eyes,

1199
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:07,747
and change their minds.

1200
01:40:09,834 --> 01:40:14,884
But this propaganda
still won over many new converts.

1201
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:19,212
You know as well as I do
that anti-Semitism and Anglophobia

1202
01:40:19,376 --> 01:40:22,706
are never hard to stir up in France.

1203
01:40:23,376 --> 01:40:30,416
Even if reactions to such things
are dormant or stifled,

1204
01:40:30,667 --> 01:40:33,787
all it takes is one event, one incident,

1205
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:37,962
one international crisis
or one Dreyfus affair,

1206
01:40:37,959 --> 01:40:43,169
for feelings we thought long gone
to suddenly re-emerge in full force,

1207
01:40:43,334 --> 01:40:48,214
for beliefs we thought dead
to be simply dormant.

1208
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:53,416
<i>Edouard Drumont was the first in France
to examine the Jewish question.</i>

1209
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:58,634
<i>The Institute of Jewish Questions
celebrates his memory today.</i>

1210
01:40:58,792 --> 01:41:02,792
<i>Mr Laville has agreed
to say a few words.</i>

1211
01:41:02,959 --> 01:41:06,079
Out of 100 Frenchmen of old stock,

1212
01:41:06,251 --> 01:41:10,671
at least 90 are pure white,
free of any other racial mixture.

1213
01:41:10,834 --> 01:41:12,174
This isn't true of the Jews.

1214
01:41:12,334 --> 01:41:17,544
The Jews are born of a mixture
which dates back thousands of years,

1215
01:41:18,001 --> 01:41:20,921
between Aryans, Mongols and Negroes.

1216
01:41:21,292 --> 01:41:26,922
Therefore, Jews have unique faces,
bodies, attitudes and gestures.

1217
01:41:27,542 --> 01:41:31,962
It is reassuring to see
that the public is interested

1218
01:41:32,126 --> 01:41:34,206
in studying the
characteristics presented

1219
01:41:34,376 --> 01:41:38,916
in the morphological section
of "Jews and France".

1220
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:42,537
In October '40,
when I came home on leave,

1221
01:41:42,542 --> 01:41:45,672
I heard that a good friend of mine,
a teacher,

1222
01:41:45,834 --> 01:41:48,634
wasn't allowed to
keep teaching that autumn,

1223
01:41:48,792 --> 01:41:52,962
because his mother was Jewish,
making him half-Jewish.

1224
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:55,041
I'd met Jews before,

1225
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:59,212
but I treated them
the same as Catholics, Protestants,

1226
01:41:59,209 --> 01:42:02,329
or people with
no religion in particular.

1227
01:42:03,376 --> 01:42:08,576
It wasn't a revolution yet,
but it did give me food for thought.

1228
01:42:09,126 --> 01:42:13,786
<i>- Did you have any Jewish teachers?
- Let me see...</i>

1229
01:42:14,834 --> 01:42:16,924
We did have one.

1230
01:42:17,959 --> 01:42:20,039
Yes, he was fired.

1231
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:28,077
The same old story.
No one ever told us anything.

1232
01:42:28,376 --> 01:42:32,536
Listen, I think we should
make a little nuance here.

1233
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:38,792
I think that when you take cases
like this teacher we mentioned,

1234
01:42:38,792 --> 01:42:44,002
I think that we tried,
to the best of our ability,

1235
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:49,632
to get these people some work
tutoring and so forth.

1236
01:42:49,834 --> 01:42:52,174
We did that for another colleague, too.

1237
01:42:52,334 --> 01:42:57,544
Like you say, it wasn't much,
but we did have sympathy for them.

1238
01:42:58,959 --> 01:43:01,539
<i>Did you really try?</i>

1239
01:43:01,709 --> 01:43:05,709
<i>Did every single teacher in Clermont
hand in their resignation?</i>

1240
01:43:05,876 --> 01:43:10,036
No way. You've no idea
what the mentality was like back then.

1241
01:43:10,209 --> 01:43:13,169
Collective resignation? Come on!

1242
01:43:14,792 --> 01:43:18,172
<i>In 1940, Vichy came out
with the Jewish decrees.</i>

1243
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:22,379
<i>In the small ads of</i> Le Moniteur,
<i>a local merchant announced</i>

1244
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:24,632
<i>that he was 100% pure French.</i>

1245
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:28,207
<i>Sir, are you Marius?</i>

1246
01:43:28,376 --> 01:43:30,246
Yes, I'm Marius.

1247
01:43:30,417 --> 01:43:32,787
<i>You're weighed down with medals.</i>

1248
01:43:32,959 --> 01:43:36,079
I fought in World War I.

1249
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:39,461
- <i>They're all medals from WWI?</i>
- That's right.

1250
01:43:39,959 --> 01:43:41,789
<i>You must be a very brave man.</i>

1251
01:43:41,959 --> 01:43:45,789
I followed the others. I did my duty.

1252
01:43:45,959 --> 01:43:49,629
<i>When France was demobilised,</i>

1253
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:55,417
<i>when France was defeated in the 2nd war,
how did you react?</i>

1254
01:43:55,876 --> 01:43:58,496
We certainly weren't very happy.

1255
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:04,207
As veterans of World War I,
the defeat affected us deeply.

1256
01:44:05,251 --> 01:44:09,251
<i>Were there many Jewish stores?</i>

1257
01:44:09,417 --> 01:44:11,167
Yes, there were.

1258
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:13,329
<i>So you must have seen a lot?</i>

1259
01:44:13,501 --> 01:44:18,831
You could say that.
They all packed up their bags and left.

1260
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:20,711
They went into exile.

1261
01:44:20,876 --> 01:44:23,786
<i>And there weren't any arrests?</i>

1262
01:44:23,959 --> 01:44:25,919
There were arrests everywhere.

1263
01:44:26,084 --> 01:44:27,674
<i>And you saw them?</i>

1264
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:29,214
Yes, unfortunately.

1265
01:44:29,959 --> 01:44:36,329
<i>Tell me, when what were called
"the Jewish decrees" came out,</i>

1266
01:44:38,584 --> 01:44:41,544
<i>apparently you took out an ad.</i>

1267
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:42,749
That's correct.

1268
01:44:43,792 --> 01:44:45,712
<i>It was an ad in Le Moniteur.</i>

1269
01:44:45,876 --> 01:44:47,956
You're certainly well-informed.

1270
01:44:49,001 --> 01:44:52,131
You see, sir, we were four brothers.

1271
01:44:52,126 --> 01:44:56,286
It was the solution I found,
as people thought we were Jews.

1272
01:44:56,292 --> 01:45:00,462
My name, Klein, sounds quite Jewish.

1273
01:45:01,501 --> 01:45:03,581
But I'm a Catholic.

1274
01:45:04,626 --> 01:45:09,666
And this was a real source of concern.
I had some problems because of that.

1275
01:45:09,834 --> 01:45:15,044
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
It was important that I tell people

1276
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:17,132
that I am really French.

1277
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:24,247
<i>In other words, you wanted
your clients to know you weren't Jewish.</i>

1278
01:45:24,417 --> 01:45:26,167
That is correct.

1279
01:45:26,501 --> 01:45:28,331
<i>Why?</i>

1280
01:45:28,584 --> 01:45:30,794
Because some said I was Jewish.

1281
01:45:30,959 --> 01:45:33,789
Jews were being arrested,
and they said we were Jewish.

1282
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:37,964
Do you see?
I couldn't very well allow myself

1283
01:45:38,126 --> 01:45:41,076
to be labelled as a Jew
since I'm a Catholic.

1284
01:45:42,126 --> 01:45:46,286
So that's why, as you said,
I took out an ad.

1285
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:50,462
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
One was killed.

1286
01:45:50,626 --> 01:45:56,536
- The other three were imprisoned.
- <i>But Jews fought in World</i> War I, too.

1287
01:45:56,709 --> 01:45:58,789
That's true. I realise that.

1288
01:45:58,792 --> 01:46:01,922
I've never been a racist.

1289
01:46:02,959 --> 01:46:06,079
Jewish or Mahometan,
all that mattered to me

1290
01:46:06,084 --> 01:46:09,214
was that the man did his duty,

1291
01:46:09,209 --> 01:46:12,329
in which case,
he was as French as the rest of us.

1292
01:46:12,334 --> 01:46:14,424
You understand?

1293
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:20,502
<i>You weren't high on the priority list</i>

1294
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:24,827
<i>of those persecuted by Hitler's regime.</i>

1295
01:46:25,001 --> 01:46:30,041
<i>But did you know any Jews,
Communists, or Freemasons who were?</i>

1296
01:46:30,209 --> 01:46:34,289
I met more Jews
than I'll ever meet again.

1297
01:46:34,459 --> 01:46:37,169
I had two girls working at the pharmacy,

1298
01:46:37,334 --> 01:46:42,544
who were considered to be evil
just because they were Jewish.

1299
01:46:42,709 --> 01:46:48,499
One was the daughter of an amazing man,
a Parisian polytechnician.

1300
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:51,917
She was a pretty amazing girl herself.

1301
01:46:52,459 --> 01:46:56,829
The other was the daughter of Hirsch,
a colleague in Strasbourg.

1302
01:46:57,001 --> 01:47:00,081
Nobody wanted anything
to do with these girls.

1303
01:47:00,251 --> 01:47:06,421
He had warned every pharmacy
in Clermont not to hire these girls.

1304
01:47:06,876 --> 01:47:11,286
- Who <i>is "he?"</i>
- The pharmacy inspector.

1305
01:47:12,001 --> 01:47:16,751
<i>The film industry gave them a chance
to steal billions of francs.</i>

1306
01:47:16,917 --> 01:47:21,957
<i>Tannenzaft, better known as Nathan,
who in the eyes of the world,</i>

1307
01:47:22,126 --> 01:47:25,076
<i>was the ultimate symbol
of French cinema,</i>

1308
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:30,001
<i>has cost the public
nearly 700,000,000 francs.</i>

1309
01:47:32,126 --> 01:47:38,166
<i>Mr Pierre Mendés-France, did you enjoy
going to the cinema back then?</i>

1310
01:47:38,334 --> 01:47:40,714
I went to the cinema
because I enjoyed it,

1311
01:47:40,876 --> 01:47:46,076
but I had yet another reason,
as I had quickly discovered

1312
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:53,131
that cinemas provided a refuge
which was both fun and comfortable,

1313
01:47:53,376 --> 01:47:58,576
you could sit down in a cinema
at 3:00 in the afternoon,

1314
01:47:58,584 --> 01:48:02,754
and stay there in the darkness
for hours on end,

1315
01:48:02,751 --> 01:48:05,881
without anyone ever seeing you.

1316
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:11,829
It was a great hiding place.
In many pre-war French films,

1317
01:48:12,001 --> 01:48:15,041
there were Jewish actors
or Jewish directors.

1318
01:48:15,251 --> 01:48:21,331
And in the credits of these films,
the Jewish names had been erased.

1319
01:48:21,501 --> 01:48:25,671
<i>Today World News was able to film
a part of the trial</i>

1320
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:28,634
<i>of the Jew Tannenzaft, Bernard Nathan.</i>

1321
01:48:28,792 --> 01:48:35,042
<i>Our presence clearly disturbed the
accused who wanted his privacy.</i>

1322
01:48:35,209 --> 01:48:38,749
<i>He raises an objection,
but is overruled by the court.</i>

1323
01:48:57,209 --> 01:48:59,959
Go away. Leave me alone.

1324
01:49:00,126 --> 01:49:02,126
This is a tragedy, not a comedy!

1325
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:13,997
The Germans were discreet about it,
but they wanted to see their films.

1326
01:49:14,209 --> 01:49:18,249
There were operettas.
There were the first films in colour.

1327
01:49:18,417 --> 01:49:24,457
Some, like La <i>Ville</i> Dorée,
weren't propaganda, others were.

1328
01:49:24,626 --> 01:49:28,786
Films like <i>Le Juif Suss</i>
were pure propaganda.

1329
01:49:29,042 --> 01:49:32,922
And the thing that
I found most revolting

1330
01:49:33,084 --> 01:49:36,214
was that they weren't
only German productions,

1331
01:49:36,376 --> 01:49:39,496
which would have been understandable

1332
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:41,377
since they had occupied us,

1333
01:49:41,709 --> 01:49:47,959
but that they were made with the
blessing of the French authorities,

1334
01:49:48,126 --> 01:49:54,246
on behalf of French organisations,
dubbed by French actors.

1335
01:50:38,876 --> 01:50:44,956
The events in this film
are based on historical fact.

1336
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:50,291
At first, audiences probably thought
these films were

1337
01:50:50,459 --> 01:50:53,129
just like any other German film.

1338
01:50:53,459 --> 01:50:56,539
But people very quickly began to realise

1339
01:50:56,709 --> 01:51:01,459
that it was just typical propaganda,

1340
01:51:01,626 --> 01:51:04,996
in the worst sense of the word.

1341
01:51:05,167 --> 01:51:09,827
This led to a kind of
strike among viewers.

1342
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:14,041
Even those who weren't especially
interested in the Free French,

1343
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:19,669
who had got into the habit
of seeing normal German films,

1344
01:51:20,667 --> 01:51:25,997
were extremely revolted
and refused to have any part in it.

1345
01:51:26,167 --> 01:51:29,877
Gentlemen,
this Jew's criminal record shows nothing

1346
01:51:30,042 --> 01:51:34,212
of the suffering of our people
during his tyranny.

1347
01:51:34,209 --> 01:51:40,459
This is why I give the floor to
the person who has suffered most.

1348
01:51:40,626 --> 01:51:45,326
I ask for nothing.
You are the judges, not me.

1349
01:51:45,542 --> 01:51:49,832
Please, Sturm, you are the one
with the most right to judge him.

1350
01:51:50,876 --> 01:51:52,956
It is not my decision to take.

1351
01:51:54,001 --> 01:51:57,131
Suffering is too subjective.

1352
01:51:58,167 --> 01:52:00,037
It would be unfair.

1353
01:52:00,251 --> 01:52:05,881
However, I see an ancient article
of criminal law which applies:

1354
01:52:06,501 --> 01:52:09,631
"If ever a Jew commits a sin...

1355
01:52:10,126 --> 01:52:14,456
"If ever a Jew commits a sin of
the flesh with a Christian woman,

1356
01:52:14,626 --> 01:52:17,746
"he shall be publicly hung
without further ado."

1357
01:52:18,042 --> 01:52:21,962
"If ever a Jew commits a sin of
the flesh with a Christian,

1358
01:52:22,126 --> 01:52:25,246
"he shall be publicly hung
without further ado,

1359
01:52:25,251 --> 01:52:30,461
"as punishment,
and as an example for all others."

1360
01:52:39,834 --> 01:52:43,004
Have mercy! I've done nothing wrong!

1361
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:46,497
I've always acted in
the name of my saviour!

1362
01:52:49,209 --> 01:52:54,419
It's not my fault
that your duke wanted to betray you!

1363
01:52:58,376 --> 01:53:01,786
I can fix everything, I swear.
Everything!

1364
01:53:01,959 --> 01:53:06,629
Take all that I own. Take all my money.
But don't take my life!

1365
01:53:06,917 --> 01:53:09,667
I am innocent!

1366
01:53:09,834 --> 01:53:13,464
I'm just a poor Jew. Let me live.

1367
01:53:14,209 --> 01:53:15,579
I want to live!

1368
01:53:15,751 --> 01:53:18,961
I want to live! Live!

1369
01:53:34,001 --> 01:53:39,041
The State Council and I speak
for all Wurttembergers in decreeing

1370
01:53:39,209 --> 01:53:43,209
that all Jews must leave Wurttemberg
in the next three days.

1371
01:53:43,376 --> 01:53:47,036
This is valid across the entire country.

1372
01:53:47,209 --> 01:53:52,459
This decree has been taken in Stuttgart
on February 4, 1738.

1373
01:53:52,751 --> 01:53:56,671
May our descendants remember this,

1374
01:53:56,834 --> 01:54:01,674
for in doing so, they will spare
themselves much pain and suffering,

1375
01:54:01,917 --> 01:54:07,577
and will keep their blood pure
of the influence of this accursed race.

1376
01:54:10,126 --> 01:54:13,246
THE END

1377
01:54:18,459 --> 01:54:24,539
There were only certain people
who actually enjoyed Le <i>Juif Suss,</i>

1378
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:29,919
the anti-Semites who saw
their beliefs confirmed in the film.

1379
01:54:30,959 --> 01:54:33,039
The collaborators would also see it.

1380
01:54:33,042 --> 01:54:37,212
Then there were those
who were taken by surprise.

1381
01:54:37,376 --> 01:54:44,326
I'd say that 80% of the people
who came to see <i>Le Juif Suss</i>

1382
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:49,711
assumed it would be just like
any other light-hearted film.

1383
01:54:49,709 --> 01:54:52,829
The German films weren't
particularly good.

1384
01:54:54,917 --> 01:55:01,167
However,
they featured many French film stars,

1385
01:55:01,167 --> 01:55:07,417
as Continental had made
many French films before the war.

1386
01:55:07,417 --> 01:55:10,537
Tino Rossi and the like
filmed at Continental.

1387
01:55:11,584 --> 01:55:16,134
<i>As an artistic endeavour,
several actors are off to Germany.</i>

1388
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:18,882
<i>At the Gare de l'Est,
we've spotted Albert Préjean,</i>

1389
01:55:20,959 --> 01:55:21,999
<i>Danielle Darrieux,</i>

1390
01:55:25,834 --> 01:55:27,044
<i>Suzy Delair,</i>

1391
01:55:27,376 --> 01:55:29,286
<i>Junie Astor,</i>

1392
01:55:35,542 --> 01:55:37,042
<i>Viviane Romance.</i>

1393
01:55:37,209 --> 01:55:42,579
<i>Dr Karl Frohlich, president
of the German Cinema Corporation,</i>

1394
01:55:42,751 --> 01:55:48,791
<i>has invited them on a 12-day studio tour
of Vienna, Munich and Berlin.</i>

1395
01:55:54,584 --> 01:56:00,384
<i>Paris. The arrival of Mr Heydrich,
SS general, head of security,</i>

1396
01:56:00,542 --> 01:56:05,582
<i>the Reich's Prague representative, asked
by Mr Himmler, SS and police chief,</i>

1397
01:56:05,751 --> 01:56:12,001
<i>to officially install Mr Oberg
in his new post in occupied territory.</i>

1398
01:56:13,042 --> 01:56:17,042
<i>Mr Heydrich is president
of the International Criminal Police,</i>

1399
01:56:17,209 --> 01:56:21,379
<i>a commission to which
France has always belonged.</i>

1400
01:56:24,501 --> 01:56:30,581
<i>Mr Heydrich visited Mr Bousquet,
secretary general of the police,</i>

1401
01:56:30,751 --> 01:56:33,881
<i>and Mr Hiller,
secretary general of administration.</i>

1402
01:56:37,001 --> 01:56:41,001
<i>He also had a chance
to see Mr Dartier de Pellepoix,</i>

1403
01:56:41,167 --> 01:56:45,327
<i>in charge of Jewish Questions,
as well as Mr de Brinon.</i>

1404
01:56:52,626 --> 01:56:54,706
<i>What was Paris like back then?</i>

1405
01:56:56,792 --> 01:56:58,882
There were two sides to Paris.

1406
01:56:58,876 --> 01:57:01,996
There were those struggling to survive,

1407
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:05,127
and there was high society.

1408
01:57:06,167 --> 01:57:09,287
All we were missing was Régine.

1409
01:57:10,334 --> 01:57:12,424
There's no doubt about it.

1410
01:57:12,417 --> 01:57:15,537
Everyone's ashamed to say it today,

1411
01:57:15,542 --> 01:57:18,672
but for some, life in Paris was great.

1412
01:57:43,667 --> 01:57:48,877
Maxim's and Le Boeuf sur le Toit
did a booming business.

1413
01:57:49,917 --> 01:57:54,077
The film industry was in full swing.

1414
01:57:54,084 --> 01:57:59,294
From what I've heard,
actually, or so they say,

1415
01:57:59,292 --> 01:58:02,422
French films were so good then

1416
01:58:02,417 --> 01:58:07,627
because a certain category
of producers had fled to the States.

1417
01:58:08,667 --> 01:58:12,827
Many directors have gone on
to do very well in their careers,

1418
01:58:13,876 --> 01:58:15,956
but they forget what they said then.

1419
01:58:15,959 --> 01:58:19,079
Paris was a fun and crazy place.

1420
01:58:19,251 --> 01:58:26,331
Let me assure you that there were
some wild and crazy times back then.

1421
01:58:31,584 --> 01:58:34,544
All right, boys. This way.

1422
01:58:34,709 --> 01:58:39,919
We'll go straight to the source
to wet our whistles.

1423
01:58:43,042 --> 01:58:45,132
What happened to you in 1937?

1424
01:58:46,167 --> 01:58:49,287
You can't even begin to imagine.

1425
01:58:50,334 --> 01:58:53,294
- It's a long story.
- Be careful...

1426
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:57,629
First give us a drink,
then we'll see what's up.

1427
01:58:57,626 --> 01:59:01,786
I think we're going
to earn our drink today.

1428
01:59:01,959 --> 01:59:06,999
- Is that red wine?
- Yes, it's as Red as I am.

1429
01:59:09,084 --> 01:59:11,004
<i>So what happened in here?</i>

1430
01:59:11,167 --> 01:59:13,247
This cellar has seen everything.

1431
01:59:14,292 --> 01:59:17,252
The Resistance in Auvergne began here.

1432
01:59:17,417 --> 01:59:22,627
The night the first weapons arrived,
we met in this very cellar,

1433
01:59:23,667 --> 01:59:27,667
and we sang the Internationale.
We weren't Communists,

1434
01:59:27,834 --> 01:59:33,044
but as <i>Pétain</i> sang <i>the Marseillaise,
we had to sing the Internationale.</i>

1435
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:41,376
You see, people attended
the raising of the colours reluctantly.

1436
01:59:41,542 --> 01:59:43,292
<i>- Yet they still came?
- They had no choke.</i>

1437
01:59:43,459 --> 01:59:48,669
It is in times like those
when you begin to realise

1438
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:53,882
what people are really like.

1439
01:59:54,917 --> 01:59:58,037
<i>- How</i> do you <i>mean?</i>
- They were scared stiff.

1440
01:59:59,084 --> 02:00:01,174
With only a few exceptions.

1441
02:00:01,334 --> 02:00:07,254
<i>- Was it really a risk not to come?</i>
- <i>Risk or no</i> risk, they still came.

1442
02:00:07,417 --> 02:00:11,577
- <i>So they thought there was</i> a <i>risk?</i>
- <i>They thought so.</i>

1443
02:00:15,751 --> 02:00:20,961
I was under the impression that
there were quite a few students here

1444
02:00:20,959 --> 02:00:25,129
who ardently supported
General de Gaulle.

1445
02:00:25,292 --> 02:00:29,922
For example,
there was the son of a colleague

1446
02:00:30,334 --> 02:00:33,464
whose name escapes me, among others.

1447
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,536
<i>What about among the teachers?</i>

1448
02:00:36,584 --> 02:00:40,754
I really can't say
how many teachers supported him.

1449
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:44,921
We were sympathetic
to the young people's cause,

1450
02:00:45,959 --> 02:00:51,169
but there wasn't the same enthusiasm...

1451
02:00:51,167 --> 02:00:55,327
the same enthusiasm
which was gaining momentum

1452
02:00:56,376 --> 02:00:58,456
among the young people.

1453
02:00:58,626 --> 02:01:02,626
<i>Why do you think that is?
It often seems to be the case in life.</i>

1454
02:01:03,667 --> 02:01:10,957
Young people are, in general,
more sincere and more dynamic.

1455
02:01:10,959 --> 02:01:13,039
They don't think things through.

1456
02:01:13,042 --> 02:01:17,212
I think it would be fair to say
that they are less cautious.

1457
02:01:18,251 --> 02:01:21,381
They are more open and friendly.
What do you think?

1458
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:23,292
- They're not as scared.
- True.

1459
02:01:23,459 --> 02:01:30,749
Some of my students got caught.

1460
02:01:31,792 --> 02:01:34,922
I can't really say who.
Not so many, just a few of them.

1461
02:01:35,959 --> 02:01:40,129
In fact, many of them now have
streets named after them here.

1462
02:01:40,126 --> 02:01:42,206
There was Bacaud.

1463
02:01:42,376 --> 02:01:46,206
The street going to Fontgieve
is named after him.

1464
02:01:46,376 --> 02:01:50,536
- I taught this <i>charming boy.</i>
<i>- He was in the Resistance?</i>

1465
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:53,674
These people,

1466
02:01:54,709 --> 02:01:57,829
as Dionnet was saying earlier,
had created a network.

1467
02:01:57,834 --> 02:02:00,964
We only found out about it later.

1468
02:02:00,959 --> 02:02:05,129
They continued to pretend
they were just your average students.

1469
02:02:06,167 --> 02:02:09,287
But we only found out about this later.

1470
02:02:09,459 --> 02:02:13,289
Perhaps Dionnet,
who was in the Resistance, knew.

1471
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:15,379
<i>What was it like for the others?</i>

1472
02:02:15,542 --> 02:02:20,582
<i>How did the others react
when someone's desk was empty?</i>

1473
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:24,921
I don't know. I can't remember.

1474
02:02:25,959 --> 02:02:28,919
<i>When a student's parents were arrested,</i>

1475
02:02:29,084 --> 02:02:35,174
<i>and the son showed up at school
the next day, how did they react?</i>

1476
02:02:35,334 --> 02:02:38,294
- I can't remember.
- How can you forget?

1477
02:02:38,459 --> 02:02:39,499
Can you remember?

1478
02:02:39,501 --> 02:02:41,581
No, I can't.

1479
02:02:41,584 --> 02:02:42,634
No specific examples.

1480
02:02:43,626 --> 02:02:46,626
<i>I see some examples on the wall.</i>

1481
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:49,922
Those are our former students...

1482
02:02:49,917 --> 02:02:54,077
Aren't those the students
who died in World War I?

1483
02:02:54,251 --> 02:02:56,171
<i>It says World War ll.</i>

1484
02:02:58,251 --> 02:03:01,381
I'm trying to remember, but I can't.

1485
02:03:02,417 --> 02:03:05,537
<i>Clermont-Ferrand is giving
Marshal Pétain a warm welcome.</i>

1486
02:03:06,584 --> 02:03:10,754
<i>He has come to approve
the constitution of the Peasants' Union,</i>

1487
02:03:10,917 --> 02:03:14,917
<i>and the end of the winter crusade
for National Aid.</i>

1488
02:03:21,167 --> 02:03:25,327
<i>The head of state will then receive
the donations to National Aid</i>

1489
02:03:26,376 --> 02:03:28,456
<i>brought by peasants
from all over the region.</i>

1490
02:03:29,501 --> 02:03:34,541
<i>It is a symbolic ceremony
for the French mutual aid campaign.</i>

1491
02:03:35,334 --> 02:03:41,634
<i>A great day for France as our hearts
beat together in collective hope.</i>

1492
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:53,497
END OF PART 1
