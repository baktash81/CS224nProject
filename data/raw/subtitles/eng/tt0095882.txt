1
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,894
- There's somebody down there.
- Shh, shh. Shh!

2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,487
Is he gone yet? Is he gone?

3
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,983
- Sir, he's gone.
- Okay, let's go.

4
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,956
Yo, anybody home?

5
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,661
Shh! Idiot.

6
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,053
Close the door.

7
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:45,353
- You know what to look for, right?
- Yeah. No. A light switch?

8
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,349
Please try not to be such an idiot.

9
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,575
Ow!

10
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,738
- I'm okay.
- Nobody asked.

11
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,257
He's not here.

12
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,425
Who?

13
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:29,018
- Commissioner Hurst.
- Of course he's not here.

14
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,152
It's 3:00 in the morning. That's the point.

15
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,526
- Maybe we should have called first.
- Proctor.

16
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,067
If I'd wanted the commissioner
to watch me while I looked at his files...

17
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,282
...I could have come in during the day
and made an appointment.

18
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:49,292
Wait a minute. You mean
we're breaking and entering illegally?

19
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,169
- We are breaking the law?
- No, no, no.

20
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,547
We are not breaking the law.

21
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,881
We are merely stretching it a little.

22
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,673
Oh!

23
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,635
It's okay to break the law
if you have a good reason...

24
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,395
...like a note from your doctor
or mom or something.

25
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,476
We are not breaking the law.

26
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,859
We are stretching it.

27
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,444
Do you get it?

28
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,781
- Uh, not really, sir.
- I got a note in my pocket, okay?

29
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,239
Okay. Why didn't you just say that?

30
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,494
Commissioner Hurst...

31
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,563
"Commandant Eric Lassard." Heh.

32
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,229
Well, there he is. Heh.

33
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,864
For years you have kept me
from my rightful place...

34
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,116
...as commandant of the police academy.

35
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,280
You always manage to come out on top
somehow, don't you, huh?

36
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,095
I know that there is something in this file...

37
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,008
...that is going to help me
get the upper hand for a change. Ah.

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,726
Who's in there?

39
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,279
Commissioner Hurst?

40
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,283
Uh-- Uh, yes. Who's out there?

41
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,778
Bob the janitor, sir.

42
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,168
Oh, I understand, sir.
And I didn't see you here tonight.

43
00:04:55,712 --> 00:05:00,958
- I really appreciate that, Bob.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Bob.

44
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,260
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

45
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,594
This is it! According to these records,
Commandant Eric Lassard...

46
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,977
...reached the state's
mandatory retirement age last year!

47
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,388
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Proctor!

48
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,434
- Don't you see what this means?
- No!

49
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,485
Proctor!

50
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,988
This means that Commandant Lassard...

51
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:29,403
...should have retired
from the police academy a year ago. Ah?

52
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,866
Somehow, this information
just slipped through.

53
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,498
Well. Well, well.

54
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,002
I find it my duty
as a conscientious police officer...

55
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,792
...to see to it
that this file reaches the Personnel Office.

56
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,799
Are we gonna have to
break in there too, sir?

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,273
Officer Katherine Page.

58
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,477
Thank you, sir.

59
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,398
Officer Carla Grant.

60
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,371
Thank you.

61
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,911
Officer Bill Baker.

62
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,049
Thank you, sir.

63
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,840
Officer Bambi Brandon.

64
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,526
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

65
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,787
Officer Kevin Wilson.

66
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,892
And last, but certainly not least,
not in any way...

67
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,519
...Officer Thomas Conklin.

68
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,193
Also known as House.

69
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,521
Congratulations!

70
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,068
I'll miss you, class of '88.

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,422
Nice.

72
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,138
I've seen a lot of graduating classes.

73
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,597
And let me say that
this is one of the very best of them.

74
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,810
Clearly, Commandant Lassard
has outdone himself this time.

75
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,523
It's my privilege to announce
that Commandant Eric Lassard...

76
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,064
...will be honored
as Police Officer of the Decade...

77
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,733
...at this year's
National Police Chiefs Convention...

78
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,653
...to be held in Miami Beach.

79
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,212
This academy owes a great debt...

80
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,045
...to the vision of Commandant Lassard...

81
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,713
...which makes what I have to say next
even more difficult.

82
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,757
It is with great sadness and regret...

83
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,302
...that I must announce
Eric Lassard's retirement...

84
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,222
- ...as commandant of this police academy.
- Retirement?

85
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,689
Commandant Lassard has reached
this state's mandatory retirement age.

86
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,651
A qualified successor will,
of course, be chosen.

87
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:58,912
But the new commandant
will have no easy task filling these shoes.

88
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,990
- What are we going to do?
- Kick some butt.

89
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,709
- It's just not right.
- This is so unfair.

90
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:13,547
- I've never seen him like this.
- He was always so strong.

91
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,213
- The academy was his strength.
- Now he's lost it.

92
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,723
It's just not right.

93
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,222
- Why don't we just shoot somebody?
- Ha-ha-ha.

94
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,512
Commandant.

95
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,480
Ah, ah, ah.

96
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,233
- No. He ain't worth it.
- Congratulations on your retirement!

97
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,397
I'm sorry, I mean on your award
in Miami Beach.

98
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,190
Concerning your retirement, sir...

99
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,781
...I want you to know how much I've enjoyed
working with you all these years...

100
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,321
...and how much I hope you enjoy...

101
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,038
...your long overdue rest.

102
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:51,881
Well, I guess I'll run along
and read my book.

103
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,634
Keep in touch, everyone.

104
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,653
They just keep staring at each other.
We've got to do something.

105
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,408
I know how you feel, sir.
I was ready to toss in the towel too.

106
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:24,868
But then I met a man who changed my life.
That man was you, sir.

107
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,375
He said, "Take what you have,
however little...

108
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,958
...and do your best with it."

109
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,842
"Never quit. Never lose hope."
That's the Lassard I knew.

110
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,673
And where is that Lassard now?

111
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,138
Right here.

112
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,635
By God, you're right.

113
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,932
I was feeling sorry for myself. No more.

114
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,353
I'm still being honored...

115
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,989
...at the National Police Chiefs Convention
in Miami Beach.

116
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,529
- Affirmative, sir!
- Go there with my head held high.

117
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,415
- Yes, sir!
- It will be my finest hour!

118
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,667
- Duck!
- Get down!

119
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,623
That's the spirit, sir.

120
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,671
Good shot.

121
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,549
It would make my crowning moment
only greater...

122
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,052
...if my loyal graduates could be there
to share it with me.

123
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,259
Miami Beach? All that surf, sun and fun?

124
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,928
Then you can meet Nick, my nephew.
He's a policeman in Miami Beach.

125
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,391
We'll do it, sir. But only for you.

126
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,769
You have all given me new hope.

127
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,153
- Way to go, sir.
- We're so proud of you.

128
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:43,910
If I cannot stay, then I'll go out in style.

129
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,622
Miami Beach, get ready.

130
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,577
Get ready for Eric Lassard!

131
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,091
The fish!

132
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,599
It's good to have you back, sir.

133
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,536
- And I can assure you, this academy...
- Whoa!

134
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,949
...under my administration, will no longer
be a source of any embarrassment to you.

135
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:36,120
- Yes, yes, so you keep telling me.
- Sir.

136
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,291
Clean office.
My office hasn't been cleaned in a week.

137
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,255
- Janitor quit on me.
- Aha.

138
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,590
- Excuse me, sir.
- Ahem, commissioner...

139
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,507
...I would like you to look at
this plan that I have formulated.

140
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,518
- It restructures the training...
- I don't mean to bother you, sir!

141
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,053
...here at the academy.

142
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,268
Harris, you may well be the best man
for this position.

143
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,525
You may even wind up
as commandant of this academy.

144
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:03,235
But you sure have a lot to learn
about acting like a commandant.

145
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:10,409
At least Lassard has the respect of his men.
Whose respect do you have?

146
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,789
- Commissioner shouldn't have said that.
- He's right, Proctor.

147
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,705
I know, sir, but-- Aah!

148
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,547
He still-- He still shouldn't say it.

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,588
Oh. No, he's right.

150
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,590
Being qualified just isn't enough.

151
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,386
Now, I know that I was born
to be commandant.

152
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:37,557
It is my destiny. Proctor...

153
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,771
...you and I are going to Miami Beach.

154
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,781
- We are?
- Don't you see?

155
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,784
We'll go to Miami Beach
and help honor Lassard.

156
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,492
That will show the commissioner
what a big man I can be.

157
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,497
Huh? Ha-ha-ha. Proctor!

158
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,284
- Yes, sir.
- Get on the phone. Call the airport.

159
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,795
Make a reservation to Miami Beach.

160
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,546
- First class.
- VIP.

161
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,208
VIP. I'll impress them from the start.

162
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,377
That's brilliant, sir. Ow!

163
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,471
Hey, Jones, pick up the phone.

164
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,049
Up.

165
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,646
When's Lassard coming back?

166
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,601
I didn't know he was gone.

167
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,439
<i>Municipal airport?
This is Lieutenant Proctor...</i>

168
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,905
...of the Metropolitan Police Academy.
Captain Harris will be attending...

169
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,991
...the National Police Chiefs Convention
in Miami Beach...

170
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:37,579
...and will require two first-class tickets
aboard your most prestigious flight.

171
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,744
<i>All lines are busy. Please hold.</i>

172
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,500
I got Proctor on the telephone trying to
book two first-class tickets to Miami...

173
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,134
...for him and Harris.
And he thinks I'm the airport.

174
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,796
Great. Just what we need in Miami. Harris.

175
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,839
No, no, wait.

176
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,426
Put him on hold for a minute.

177
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,314
Checking computers right now, sir.
Please stand by.

178
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,733
Ooh! Heh.

179
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,156
I'd like the number
for Budget Rent a Plane, please.

180
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,131
- Come on, pal. Let's go.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.

181
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,284
Go!

182
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,121
Go!

183
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,291
Go!

184
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,377
- Here, boss.
- Here.

185
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,716
Duck.

186
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,420
Quietly.

187
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,681
I said quietly.

188
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,176
That's all right.

189
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,608
Ooh. Would you look at this?

190
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,025
Hey, easy. Easy, easy.

191
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,460
Get down, nitwit.

192
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,667
- Hey.
- Aah.

193
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,927
- Nighty-night.
- Heh.

194
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,632
All right, let's go.

195
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,799
All right!

196
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,977
- You got the laser?
- Yeah.

197
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:08,150
- Give it to me. Come on.
- Okay, it's hot.

198
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,405
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

199
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,537
- Here you go.
- Sugar, here.

200
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,623
Come to papa.

201
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:31,040
- Beautiful, boss.
- Oh, look at that.

202
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,092
Yes.

203
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,224
Lieutenant Callahan.

204
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,261
Sergeant Hightower.

205
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,606
Sergeant Jones.

206
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,184
Sergeant Hooks.

207
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,904
Sergeant Tackleberry.

208
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,363
Officer Conklin.

209
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,455
- Thank you.
- All right. Let's go.

210
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,490
We've got some time, boys.
What say we find ourselves the bar?

211
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,375
- Sure thing, boss.
- Yeah. Good idea, boss.

212
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,956
Watch it, kid! Watch it!

213
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,621
Hey!

214
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,256
Yeah. Nice shot. Heh, heh.

215
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,800
- Ought to keep kids on a leash.
- Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

216
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,470
- Whoa! Unh!
- Oh, no.

217
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,180
- What an idiot.
- He's stupid.

218
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,437
Boss.

219
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,356
- Out of the way, buddy.
- Jeez!

220
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,445
- Boss, you all right?
- You all right?

221
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,157
- How's my hair?
- Beautiful, boss. Beautiful.

222
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,537
There he goes, boss.

223
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,414
Let him go.
We don't want to draw attention.

224
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,663
- Yeah, the diamonds. Heh.
- Shh!

225
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,544
- Are you sure my hair's all right?
- It looks the same.

226
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,626
- How's it look?
- Hasn't budged, boss.

227
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,541
All right. Let's go.

228
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,256
Ah, Commandant Lassard...

229
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,467
...I was very sorry to learn
that we wouldn't be traveling together.

230
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,224
- Now, that is a disappointment.
- Heh.

231
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,104
Lieutenant Proctor has booked us
on a very special flight.

232
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,389
- VIP. Excuse me.
- Heh.

233
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:57,937
VIP. I understand that you're taking
an economy flight.

234
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,733
We'll just have to meet in Miami.
I'll see you there.

235
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,319
- Shame.
- Morning, sir.

236
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,787
Please be careful with the bag.

237
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,622
Flying makes him nervous.

238
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,829
Ah, ah, ah.

239
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,132
Metal, please.

240
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,341
Come through again, please.

241
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,181
Hmm?

242
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,230
Ahh.

243
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,358
Hmm?

244
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,780
It's probably the buckle, sir.
Here, I'll get it.

245
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,698
Get away from me, Proctor.

246
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,044
Thank you.

247
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,797
- Ha, ha!
- Whoo-whee.

248
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,262
Come through, please.

249
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,309
Very funny, Jones.

250
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,601
Proctor!

251
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,692
<i>Will passenger Helen Avive
please report to the ticket counter?</i>

252
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,952
Hold on. Miss? Miss.

253
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,411
Could you please tell me at what gate
Flight 1545 is boarding?

254
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,043
- Gate 24, sir.
- Aha. Could you also check and make sure...

255
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:42,299
...that I am in the special VIP section?
The name is Harris.

256
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,670
There is no VIP section, sir.
It's a private plane.

257
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,215
- Sir.
- Oh. Ah! A private plane.

258
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,430
And you and Mr. Proctor
are the only listed passengers.

259
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,893
Ah, I see. Our own plane.

260
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,855
Well, well, Harris.
You travel first-class, I must say.

261
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,487
Well, it's the only way. Come, Proctor.

262
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,692
- Bon voyage!
- Ciao!

263
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,406
Oh, my God!

264
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,881
This is great! Our own airplane.
Animals to play with.

265
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,669
I'll tell you, this VIP treatment
is worth every penny.

266
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,302
A-okay! Ha-ha-ha!

267
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,758
Aah! Proctor!

268
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:38,021
Proctor, why do I put up with you?

269
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,643
Uh, well, sir, I think that's because
my sister married your nephew...

270
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,483
- ...and that makes us--
- Shut up, Proctor!

271
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,112
Sir, they like you!

272
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,915
- Sir, what would you like to drink today?
- Nothing right now, thank you.

273
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,176
Trichloroethane just doesn't have
the appeal for me that it used to have.

274
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,587
I still depend on the old PR-24.

275
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,178
This old baby, it doesn't even break.
It pulverizes.

276
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,843
I can smash anybody.
I can hold them in a chokehold.

277
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,264
I have complete control over a perpetrator
or a group of perpetrators.

278
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:24,606
One time, when I saw these three guys
coming on from the left...

279
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,570
Eyes left!

280
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,538
Hightower, check this out.

281
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,415
- What you got there, House?
- There's an article here on Malone.

282
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,084
- I don't even like him.
- Give me five points.

283
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,423
- You got it.
- Excuse me, sir...

284
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,090
...would you mind returning
to your own seat?

285
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,681
- We're about to serve the meal.
- The meal?

286
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,316
Ooh, ay-yay-yay.

287
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,320
- Out of order.
- Let me in here. Let me in.

288
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,151
Jeez.

289
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,532
You've been waiting long?
Great. She's been...

290
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,409
Come on! Other people in need here,
you know.

291
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,036
Sorry.

292
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,420
I'm sorry. There seems to be
something wrong with the sink.

293
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:31,256
Aah. I don't believe it.
We're on the same plane.

294
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:35,138
- Boss, you know, we should, uh...?
- What, are you crazy?

295
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,095
- We can't make a scene while we got...
- Wait for your turn.

296
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,807
Come on. Let me in. Ooh, ha-ha-ha.

297
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,561
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

298
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,818
Let me out! Let me out!

299
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,985
- I'll kill him!
- No, boss!

300
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,743
- What? What? What?
- Boss. Boss.

301
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,246
- The diamonds, boss.
- Right. Right.

302
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,998
Jeez!

303
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,957
Here. Fix this.

304
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,036
Sir!

305
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,797
Please, sir. Your cigar.

306
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,174
You got a problem, lady?

307
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:14,279
- Excuse me.
- Now what?

308
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,372
Okay, nice touch, Hooks. Yeah!

309
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,414
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for flying with us.

310
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,550
We hope you enjoy your stay
in the Miami area.

311
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,053
The temperature is a balmy 82 degrees.

312
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,966
I don't know what's the matter.
It must be stuck.

313
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,601
- I'll get some help.
- Okay.

314
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,852
- It'll just be a minute or so, folks.
- Shall we help her?

315
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,563
- Let's do it.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

316
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,022
Thank you.

317
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,746
Why, thank you, gentlemen.

318
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,624
You may all deplane now.

319
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,129
<i>Attention, please.
Passengers on Flight 183...</i>

320
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,460
<i>...continuing from Miami to Caracas...</i>

321
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,674
<i>...there will be a slight delay
due to a small malfunction.</i>

322
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,512
After we deliver the diamonds,
a night on the town. Your treat.

323
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,597
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

324
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,394
Stay the hell away from that old man.

325
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,683
- He's bad luck. Keep your distance.
- Okay, boss.

326
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:38,151
He's a bucket of bad news.
All right, now we can relax.

327
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,155
Whoa!

328
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:52,039
- You okay, boss? You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,087
- The bag. The bag!
- I'll get it.

330
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,969
- I got it.
- I'm all right.

331
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,882
- Give me the damn bag.
- You got it.

332
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,677
Let's get the hell out of here.
I got people to meet.

333
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,268
- What is this?
- Looks like a moron convention.

334
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,983
- That's a nice set of papayas.
- Va-Va-Va-voom.

335
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,239
- There he is. There he is.
- Who? Ugh.

336
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,116
Gah! Jesus.

337
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,620
I've read of your accomplishments,
and I must say that our city...

338
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,953
...is proud to welcome
the Police Officer of the Decade.

339
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:35,746
- You're very, very kind, Mr. Mayor.
- Our police commissioner, Dave Murdock.

340
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,165
He's in charge of
the Police Chiefs Convention.

341
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:42,757
- Very, very pleased to meet you, Dave.
- Pleasure's all mine, Commandant Lassard.

342
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,887
Mayor Thompson, I'd like you to meet...

343
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,720
...Commandant Lassard's police commissioner,
Henry Hurst.

344
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,929
How do you do?

345
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:53,597
And these, Dave, are my finest.

346
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,481
Good to have you here, officers.

347
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,644
Stop! Halt!

348
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,608
- Good to see you, Nick.
- Hi, Uncle Eric.

349
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:08,578
That's my nephew Nick I was talking about.
I'm very, very proud of him.

350
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,535
Agh! What's the matter?
What are you doing?

351
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,087
- Here's your wallet, sir.
- Thank you, officer.

352
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,964
You're very welcome.

353
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,593
- Nick!
- Good to see you, Uncle Eric.

354
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,639
- Ah, I've looked forward to this so much.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

355
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,770
Nick, I want you to meet my finest,
my best friends.

356
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,098
Bill?

357
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,986
- Oh, excuse me. Bill? Bill?
- Oh, Eileen. Ha-ha-ha.

358
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,646
Commandant Lassard,
this is my wife, Eileen...

359
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,656
...the chairwoman
of our welcoming committee.

360
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,285
- Very pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

361
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,367
We've greeted everyone
except Captain Harris.

362
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:57,206
- We can't find him anywhere.
- Oh, he'll be along shortly.

363
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,416
He's traveling by private plane.

364
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,253
Whoa! Isn't this fun, sir? Ha, ha!

365
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,052
Wow!

366
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,273
They look impressed, sir.
I wish we had an elephant.

367
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,225
Hi!

368
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,620
Would you like something?

369
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,710
Mr. Dempsey.

370
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,291
- Your merchandise, sir.
- Ha, ha.

371
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,051
- You got the diamonds?
- Ah, yes, sir. We did like you told us.

372
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,308
We tore out the stones
and threw that gold junk away.

373
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:58,893
- Good. Good. Ha-ha-ha.
- We hid them in the camera.

374
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,898
Uh-huh.

375
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,062
- It's gift-wrapped.
- Ha-ha-ha.

376
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,701
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Sir?

377
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,131
I got no excuse, sir.
Somebody pulled a bag switch on me.

378
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,224
My boat leaves the country in 24 hours.

379
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,015
- You got till then.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,981
- Don't disappoint me again.
- Thank you, Mr. Dempsey.

381
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,270
Shit!

382
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,657
That crazy old man has our bag! All right.

383
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,537
All right, all right, all right.
We search every hotel until we find him.

384
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,164
If we don't get those diamonds back
this time tomorrow, we're dead.

385
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:03,203
We're dead! We're dead.
Oh, ho, we're dead. We're dead.

386
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,171
- You give a fine tour, David.
- Thank you.

387
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,216
Commissioner Murdock,
what have you got planned...

388
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,976
...as police procedure demonstration
this year?

389
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,106
Last year, they arrested everyone
above the rank of captain, put us all in jail.

390
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,358
Ha-ha-ha. It was all rather fun, really.

391
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:30,022
Now, Commandant Lassard, if I told you,
it would, uh, spoil the surprise.

392
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,690
Let me show you the pool area
and the rest of the hotel...

393
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,656
...where most of our convention
will take place.

394
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,788
It's a good picture.

395
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,035
I guess the uniform
brings out the best in me.

396
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,004
Uncle Eric, are you all right?

397
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,671
I'm really gonna miss all this.

398
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,388
Testing, one, two, three, four.

399
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,345
Testing, can you hear me? Testing.

400
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,477
One, two, three, four.

401
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,387
Is that okay?

402
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,773
This is gonna be a great convention.

403
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,309
They got crowd-control demonstrations...

404
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,480
...new equipment, martial arts.

405
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,240
Ooh, and, look,
a bomb-disposal presentation.

406
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,618
- You guys put on a good show.
- Yes, sir, we do.

407
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,621
But it doesn't start until this afternoon.
So this morning...

408
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,033
...I would like you to see another show
on a beautiful stretch of beach.

409
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,759
Of course, the, uh, pool is nice too.

410
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,352
- Pardon me, won't you?
- Mm-hm.

411
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,307
Whoa.

412
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,431
<i>Attention, ladies...</i>

413
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,817
<i>...the water aerobics class
will begin in 15 minutes.</i>

414
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,818
Show us how.

415
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,702
Poolside masseur.

416
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,411
Mmm. I see.

417
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:09,833
- Enjoying yourself?
- Oh, very much so. Thank you. And you?

418
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,544
Oh, yeah.

419
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:17,212
I just love it when a strange man
puts his hands all over my body.

420
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,346
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

421
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:24,136
- It gives me a chance to do this.
- No, wait. Wait. No, wait!

422
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,232
<i>Attention, guests...</i>

423
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,241
<i>...the water aerobics class
will begin in 15 minutes.</i>

424
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,908
- So I, uh, guess I deserved that.
- Mm, but it was fun.

425
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,586
Hey, Hightower, okay, here we go. Come on.

426
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,977
I'll go out for a long one, okay?
Okay, here we go. Alrighty!

427
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,559
Okay, come on.

428
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,445
Hey! Okay, all right. All right.

429
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,026
Here we go, come on.

430
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,488
I'll buy one. Okay, here we go!
Come on! All right.

431
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,996
Hey! What's the matter, no arm? Okay!

432
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,871
Andrew, honey!

433
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,757
Come on. Come get your sunblock.

434
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,844
- Hey, catch.
- Hit me long!

435
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,732
- Aah!
- Help! Help!

436
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,777
Shark!

437
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:14,496
Desist and leave
the swimming area now, mister.

438
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:21,177
- What's that guy doing?
- Move it. Move it. Move it!

439
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,133
Now!

440
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,146
All right!

441
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,418
Way to go, House!

442
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,712
The secret to a great tan is control.

443
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,717
First, I use this Number 4 tanning lotion
to give myself a nice golden brown.

444
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:14,105
Then I use a complete sunblock
to keep those dangerous rays off my skin.

445
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,028
Throw it here, to me.

446
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,949
- Some dickhead is standing in my sun.
- Captain Harris, I didn't see you there.

447
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,579
I don't think we've been introduced--

448
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:35,039
I don't care who you are, buttwipe.
Just get out of my sun.

449
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,422
- Buttwipe?
- Scram, sleazeball!

450
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,927
Okay. Fine.

451
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,592
Buttwipe, huh?
Haven't heard that in a while.

452
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,852
- That was great, sir.
- Proctor.

453
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,435
- Yes, sir.
- Now you're in my sun.

454
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,815
Oh!

455
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,976
Woof! Woof!

456
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,365
Let me have your sunblock, Kate.

457
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,704
Where's he going?

458
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,711
Is this how your feet fit in these things?

459
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,584
Hey, I've never done this before.
This is my first time!

460
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,504
So, uh, don't do anything
until I wave my hand, okay?

461
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,721
- Whatever.
- Hey, you got that?

462
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,769
Hey. Hey! Hey!

463
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,150
Hey, stop!

464
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,318
Hey! Excuse me!

465
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,905
Hey! Excuse me!

466
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,788
Ah. Oh, well. Never mind!

467
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,479
Heh, thanks. I meant to do that too.

468
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,734
Thanks. Thank you.

469
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,769
Pretty good, huh?

470
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,780
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo! Yeah.

471
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,196
Huh? Oh!

472
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,636
Hello, dork.

473
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,938
Hey, what's happening, dork?
Ha-ha-ha!

474
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,060
- Hey, dork!
- Hey, dork!

475
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,476
- Hey, dork! Ha-ha-ha!
- Yeah, dork.

476
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,486
Check that guy out.

477
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,112
You do good work, Lisa.
No question about it.

478
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,702
Mr. Mayor, excuse me, sir.
I don't mean to insult your city...

479
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,492
...but the people on this beach
are very rude and hostile.

480
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,834
I'm sorry to hear that, Captain Dork.

481
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,055
He's an old guy about this tall,
with white hair, always carries a golf bag.

482
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,559
- You haven't seen him?
- He ain't at this hotel either, boss.

483
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,640
Come on, come on.

484
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,602
We are dead men. We are dead.

485
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,233
Three dead men, that's who we are.
We are dead.

486
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,319
- Where the hell have you guys been?
- We was at the track.

487
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,826
- Mr. Dempsey couldn't find us.
- He was very upset, you know.

488
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,956
- Any of you guys want a doughnut?
- We got to find this old guy!

489
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,243
It's gonna be dark soon.
We gotta look, find this guy.

490
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,075
<i>Limbo in the nighttime
Where the island breezes always blow</i>

491
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,954
<i>Maybe then we'll find out
Just how low you go</i>

492
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,833
<i>The music's getting faster
And the stick is getting lower</i>

493
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:30,337
<i>Before the night is through
We'll see how low you go</i>

494
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,173
<i>How low</i>

495
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,008
Uh, can we get
a couple of those potato coladas?

496
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,389
What?

497
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,347
Oh! And, uh, could I get a pink--?
No, make it a green umbrella.

498
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,520
<i>How low can you go?</i>

499
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,896
<i>Do you even know?</i>

500
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,532
<i>When it's all done
Will you be the one?</i>

501
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,363
<i>How low</i>

502
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,912
Drink up, sir. Bottoms up.

503
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:10,453
- May I have a grasshopper, please?
- Hi, how are you?

504
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,378
Mm-mm.

505
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,791
What a snob.

506
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:21,589
Snob? Take a look at yourself,
you first-class schmuck.

507
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,848
<i>How low can you go?</i>

508
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,734
<i>Do you even know?</i>

509
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:37,487
<i>When it's all done
Will you be the one?</i>

510
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,774
<i>How low can you go?</i>

511
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,909
<i>How low</i>

512
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,287
Change. Give me some change.

513
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,877
- Scorpio, right?
- No.

514
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,007
Sir, can I get a cigar?

515
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,167
- Hi.
- Proctor.

516
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,677
- Hi.
- Sir.

517
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,558
- Hi. Hello.
- Ugh.

518
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,727
- Libra?
- Heh. No.

519
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,189
- Well, you are a very pretty lady.
- Thanks.

520
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,854
Ooh, that's a nice suntan.

521
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,695
Ahem. Um...

522
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,828
I got a little suntan today too. Ha, ha.

523
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,788
That's nice.

524
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,172
Maybe you'd like to come up to my room later
and put a little lotion on it.

525
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,799
No? Oh, look at these cute freckles.

526
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,591
What is your name, little girl?

527
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,842
What are you doing, blowing in my ear?

528
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,427
- No, sir, I--
- Scram!

529
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,183
- Bu-- Bu--
- Ach!

530
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,349
- My name is, uh, Thaddeus Harris.
- Hey!

531
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,639
- Maybe you've heard of me.
- Not really.

532
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,020
- Put it out!
- Don't.

533
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,160
I guess coming up to my room
is out of the question.

534
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,745
Ugh!

535
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,791
Women. Go figure.

536
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,674
<i>How low</i>

537
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,567
I won't tell anyone.

538
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,817
Is it a mock bomb threat?
A robbery? Am I getting warm?

539
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,404
Eric, I'm not telling you anything
about the police procedure demonstration.

540
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,070
- You're just going to have to wait and see.
- Oh, well...

541
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,079
You have a fine operation, David.
Thank you for showing it to me.

542
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,495
My pleasure, Eric.
I'm just sorry that I made us run late.

543
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,668
All right.

544
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,044
All right, between us,
we've covered every hotel on hotel row.

545
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,510
You guys. I want you guys
to start South Beach.

546
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,300
We don't see him here,
we'll start Northside...

547
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,264
...and work our way to you. You got it?

548
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,020
You got it? Okay, get out of here.

549
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,940
You squirted me with your doughnut, moron!

550
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,903
- You're disgusting. You're such a pig!
- Boss, I'm sorry.

551
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,783
Pigs. You guys are such pigs.

552
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,070
- We better go right on in.
- Hey, boss.

553
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,995
That's him!

554
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,158
Come on, get out of here!
What are you waiting for?

555
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,546
Whoa! Oh, dear.

556
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,594
Excuse us, Gunga Din.

557
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,009
- Yeah, Gunga.
- Where's the boss?

558
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,140
- Hey, boss.
- Boss.

559
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,227
- He's right there, boss. See him?
- He's right over there, boss.

560
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,816
We grab him. We get out. Quiet if we can,
rough if we have to. You got it?

561
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,950
- Got it, boss.
- I'll take the big guy.

562
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,453
- Both are big.
- I got the guy with white hair.

563
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,658
Both got white hair.

564
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,243
- I'll take left.
- Your left?

565
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,124
- Would you shut up?
- Okay, boss.

566
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,956
- You got it?
- Got it boss.

567
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,093
Oh, come on in and register.

568
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,847
Uh, sorry, wrong room.

569
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,801
Best of luck.

570
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,309
The blue card is your lunch pass.

571
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:44,397
- Boss, he's a cop!
- We're dead men, boss.

572
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,109
- Boss!
- Shut up. I gotta think.

573
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:52,367
Would you two guys clean yourselves up?
You're disgusting!

574
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,280
He's a cop.

575
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:03,996
Come on, Birdie.
Let's get our little fish a little sunshine.

576
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,679
Where's my little fish?

577
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,765
Birdie, where are you?

578
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,854
Oh, they shouldn't have.

579
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,570
Splendid!

580
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,006
Come on out.

581
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,342
Hotel laundry service, sir.

582
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,129
You got anything you want
dry cleaned or laundried?

583
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,265
- Nothing today, thank you.
- Very good, sir.

584
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:11,946
Ah, this present has real possibilities.

585
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:19,454
There you are, you naughty, naughty fish.

586
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,833
I was thinking of having him
put a little more blue in it...

587
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:28,997
Come on.

588
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,167
- A piece of cake, boss.
- Hey! Huh?

589
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,586
What? What?

590
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,546
What have we got here?

591
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,423
Hey.

592
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,475
Hey.

593
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,681
Where is the camera?

594
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,679
And Bambi's not going to take any flak...

595
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:26,893
...when she wears this lovely
camouflage flak vest. Right, Bambi?

596
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,066
Would you care to try it on, sir?

597
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:34,276
Ooh, handcuffs. Laverne, look, restraints.

598
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:38,071
Uh, excuse me, miss. Pardon me, miss?

599
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,162
Excuse me. Uh-- Uh--

600
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:47,326
- Pardon me--
- Oh, Hooks. Hooks!

601
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,621
Why don't you try this?

602
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,386
This works even better!

603
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,306
Out of my way, dickhead.

604
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,473
Dick...

605
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:12,980
...weed.

606
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,270
So when you see him, go:

607
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,617
You know what I mean? Okay.

608
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,698
When you see the guy, all right?

609
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,407
Thank you.

610
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,582
Hey, dork. Hey, dork.

611
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,642
Don't miss the latest
in police holds and grips.

612
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:49,145
They will be demonstrated
on five different mats.

613
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,023
We have experts demonstrating
techniques in...

614
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:57,062
...judo, aikido, tae kwon do,
hapkido and karate.

615
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,822
- Hey, Callahan.
- Nick.

616
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,904
Excellent technique.

617
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,744
- Is that Kate?
- Yeah.

618
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,156
- Didn't know she could do that?
- Didn't even know she was a cop.

619
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,543
Where is he?

620
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,463
- Cut the strap!
- I'm trying.

621
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,377
Don't!

622
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,259
- Come on, just get the camera.
- Okay, okay.

623
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,341
Missed him again.
Go around the wall.

624
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:29,553
With our next volunteer,
we will demonstrate the chokehold.

625
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,183
We take him down with a sweep-down.

626
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,860
If he becomes aggressive...

627
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,699
...we take his arm, turn him around...

628
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,325
...into the stomach throw.

629
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,159
Next?

630
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,334
I accept your challenge.

631
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,836
Okay.

632
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,086
Let's see what you got, Jonesey.

633
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,048
All right, you're on.

634
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,857
Huh. Very good.

635
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,686
Thank you.

636
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,026
- Hey. Hey!
- Next.

637
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,691
Jones, look at that. It's a knife.

638
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,985
- Watch this!
- Did she say knife? Whoo!

639
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,581
- Didn't hurt. That hurt.
- Hiya!

640
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,244
Brother, let me help you up. Here.

641
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,007
Not bad for a beginner.

642
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,793
What a good sport. Next.

643
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,384
That's it for me, lady.

644
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,139
Come on, don't be afraid.

645
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,645
- Make way.
- Ah, here's a volunteer.

646
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,898
Commissioner, fabulous convention.

647
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,559
- Fabulous, sir.
- Good.

648
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,317
- Now... Unh!
- This is a great convention.

649
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,107
Next. I need a volunteer.

650
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,742
Whoa! Ha, ha.

651
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,072
- Thanks.
- Hi.

652
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,535
- Upsy-daisy.
- Whoa!

653
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:17,998
Agh!

654
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,038
That's okay, I'm all right.

655
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,335
Ow.

656
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,592
- Thank you. Thank you!
- Next.

657
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,298
Thank you.

658
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:33,010
An authoritative voice
is very important in crowd control.

659
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,646
Now, let's see how some of you people
do in this situation.

660
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,724
Officer, out here with me.

661
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,572
The crowd has just broken through
your police line, officer.

662
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:47,732
Move them back.

663
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:52,075
<i>Hell, no! We won't go! Hell, no! We won't go!</i>

664
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,159
<i>Hell, no! We won't go!</i>

665
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,996
Hey! Hey! Hey!

666
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:03,173
- What's the matter. You think I'll hurt you?
- Mm, yeah.

667
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:07,176
Just remember what I taught you, okay?

668
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,838
- Be gentle.
- Okay.

669
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,349
Jeez, I, uh, guess I did that wrong, huh?

670
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,734
I don't know.
This technique has its merits.

671
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:27,364
- Oh, well, shall we try it again?
- Practice makes perfect.

672
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,906
Officer, your turn. Out here with me.

673
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,995
<i>Hell, no! We won't go!</i>

674
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,332
Excuse me. We need to keep it clear.

675
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:46,424
It would really help us a lot
if you'll just back up.

676
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,673
Back off, you turkeys!

677
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:54,137
I'm a police officer,
and when I talk, you listen!

678
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:59,054
Now, get your butts the hell back there
before I really get mad!

679
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,224
And no back talk!

680
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,946
- We jump out of this. That's him?
- Yeah. Go out on the limb.

681
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,159
Let's get him.

682
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,876
- Where'd he go?
- Why haven't we hit the ground?

683
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,081
Physics.

684
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:30,010
- Way to zing there, officer.
- Very nice shooting, officer.

685
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,587
Agh!

686
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,684
Excellent shooting! Excellent!

687
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,948
Officer, you need to share those weapons
with the other officers.

688
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,576
No. I need these.

689
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,155
Let me talk to him.

690
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,283
Eugene. Eugene!

691
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,330
I'll get you some of your very own
just as soon as we get home.

692
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,624
- You promise?
- Cross my heart.

693
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,760
- Okay.
- Good.

694
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,553
Thank you very much. Thank you.

695
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,066
Uh, Eugene, this one too.

696
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,282
Let's go.

697
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:51,416
Thank you. Let's go, guys. Excuse me.
Excuse me!

698
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,835
May I have an interview, please?

699
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,926
On three, two, one, guys.
Hello, and you are?

700
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,309
Captain Thaddeus Harris
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

701
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,097
Only a captain? Cut. Out of here.

702
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,105
- A nobody.
- Looks like a waiter.

703
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,858
- Sir--
- Not a word, Proctor.

704
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,314
- But--
- Eh!

705
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,820
- Sir--
- Eh!

706
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,785
All right. Okay.

707
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,038
Our 24 hours are almost gone.

708
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,533
We gotta get that camera back now!

709
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:30,297
Eh! Why do we need five guys
to take a camera from one old man?

710
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,582
- Believe me, it ain't that easy.
- Yeah.

711
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:36,594
All right. Boys, I want you
to try this one on for size.

712
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,880
Let's just say
we happen to be passing by...

713
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,640
...and the poor old guy happens to faint.

714
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:47,143
Mouse, Sugar, they happen to catch him.
They set him down on the ground, huh?

715
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,978
Maybe they open his collar. Huh?

716
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:53,395
Maybe they slip that
nasty camera off his neck.

717
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:56,815
- Hey, that is a great plan, boss.
- Very good. Ha-ha-ha.

718
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,283
If the old man faints.

719
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:02,366
Hey! Hey! He'll faint.

720
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:06,287
Julio will make sure of that.
Go on, Julio, show them.

721
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,999
We'll give him a shot,
make him go night-night.

722
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,131
- That's a pretty good plan, boss.
- Boss, that's great.

723
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,006
All right, let's get out of here.
All right, come on.

724
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,546
Come on, come on.

725
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,639
Come on, Sugar.

726
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,689
We only have about 10 more minutes of this.

727
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,104
Lassard, congratulations!

728
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,395
- Thank you so much.
- Commissioner.

729
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,737
Let me just... Here you go.

730
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:45,030
Commissioner, could I get a picture...

731
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,540
...of you congratulating
Commandant Lassard?

732
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,871
- Of course, certainly. Yes.
- Thank you.

733
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,786
Photo opportunity.

734
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,173
- Stay.
- Yeah.

735
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,342
Thank you.

736
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,564
Commandant,
I just want to say hello and congratulations.

737
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:20,489
We'll get him next time, boss.
We'll see to it. We'll get it.

738
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,696
It wasn't our fault.

739
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:26,613
Excuse me.

740
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,158
Would you just give me my damn camera?

741
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:34,295
- My camera?
- Give me my damn camera!

742
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,342
- What are those?
- Diamonds!

743
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,677
- You broke my camera.
- Diamonds!

744
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,302
All right! All right!

745
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,937
Nobody move, or the old man is history.

746
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,894
- Uh, boss.
- What, what?

747
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,683
Ah. Uh...

748
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:59,650
All right. I want to see hands in the air.
Everybody's hands up.

749
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,693
Now. Hands up!

750
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,121
Pick him up.
I want everybody where I can see them.

751
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,576
- Get the diamonds. Get the diamonds!
- Oh, I see.

752
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,496
The police procedure demonstration.

753
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,006
A kidnapping. How original.

754
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,293
- Oh, I am honored.
- Shut up, old man.

755
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,835
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

756
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,255
Now, we make for the elevator.

757
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,721
Anybody gets stupid,
he gets filled full of holes.

758
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,851
Police, freeze!

759
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:34,105
- Cover me up top!
- Let's go!

760
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,141
All right, release your hostage...

761
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:40,653
...put your weapons on the ground,
and slowly put your hands in the air!

762
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,905
Well said! That's my nephew.

763
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,283
- Shut up, old man.
- Okay, mister, hands up!

764
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:50,200
Hi.

765
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,912
Nobody's gonna shoot.
Not while I got grandpa here.

766
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,543
- Now!
- Too late!

767
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,375
Mouse, Sugar, get in the elevator!

768
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:04,044
- Nobody move!
- No, no. He's bluffing, right? Right?

769
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:08,882
Right? Smart boy. He was bluffing.
He was bluffing.

770
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,846
- He was bluffing, boss.
- He was bluffing.

771
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,726
All right! What floor? What floor? Uh...

772
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,394
Ah, ah.

773
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,193
What's the matter?
You got a problem with this floor?

774
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,575
I don't mean to interfere,
but the commissioners are all downstairs.

775
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,328
I would use the penthouse.
It's very defensible.

776
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:35,121
You're all welcome to use my suite.
Allow me.

777
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,077
What? What?

778
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,921
Ah, here we are.

779
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,436
All right, I'm ready.

780
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,027
Snap it up with those blueprints.
We don't have all day.

781
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,694
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

782
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:58,453
Tackleberry, would you please
stop doing that?

783
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,169
Sorry, sir.

784
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,714
All right. Okay, all right.

785
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,921
Now, they're gonna
give us anything we want.

786
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:12,259
So all we gotta do is figure out
the fastest way to get to Dempsey's boat.

787
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,015
I'm thirsty, boss.
You got any booze around here?

788
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:18,804
- Certainly. The bar's very well-stocked.
- Thanks.

789
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,855
There might still be
some ice cream left in the freezer.

790
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,233
Thanks. You're really a good host.

791
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,564
- You're very welcome.
- Ah.

792
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,446
Hey. Hey. Hey!

793
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,778
Do you mind?

794
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,944
Some of us are trying
to plan our escape here.

795
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,956
- Sorry, boss.
- So we are definitely gonna need...

796
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,742
- ...a boat at the harbor.
- And?

797
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,128
And we're definitely gonna need
a fast car...

798
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,380
- ...at the hotel back entrance.
- Uh-uh.

799
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,960
What, what?

800
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:53,175
With the roof so accessible,
you'd be a fool not to ask for a helicopter.

801
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,932
Pssh, ha! Helicopter? What a stupid idea!

802
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:02,472
No. He's right.

803
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:07,690
We'd be a sitting duck in that car.
The chopper is a great idea.

804
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,489
- So we take the chopper to the harbor--
- Then?

805
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:15,447
- Then we switch to the boat!
- Uh-uh.

806
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,452
What? You don't like the boat? What?

807
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,238
- What?
- What?

808
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,075
I have to go to the little boys' room.

809
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,371
No, this is a kidnapping!
It's not a kindergarten!

810
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:29,165
Boss, he did think of the helicopter.

811
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:33,215
Yeah. Come on, boss. Huh?

812
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,923
All right, fine.

813
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,267
But make it quick.
Got a phone call to make here.

814
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,803
All right.

815
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,065
Come on. All right! All right. Ah.

816
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,322
All we can do now
is wait until we hear their demands.

817
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:59,029
I'm afraid you're right.
All we can do now is wait.

818
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,664
Would someone please wake Harris up?

819
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,665
He's thinking.

820
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:27,936
Here we go, come on. Open up.
Big "aah." Big "aah."

821
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,934
Tackleberry!

822
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,405
Would you please stop doing that?

823
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,744
Sorry, sir.

824
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,574
Incoming call for you, sir.

825
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,663
- Hello.
- All right. Listen up. Listen up!

826
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,547
I want a helicopter with pilot
on the roof of this hotel.

827
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,798
And?

828
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,132
And I want a fast boat
waiting for me in the harbor.

829
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:00,924
- Aha!
- If all goes well, I see no cops...

830
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,888
...I hand the old man back to you
at the 12-mile mark off Key West...

831
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:07,351
...as soon as we're safe
in international waters.

832
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,105
We want some proof
that Lassard is still alive.

833
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,022
- Ah. Your buddies want to talk to you.
- Oh! Heh.

834
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,191
- Hello?
<i>- Commandant Lassard?</i>

835
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,361
Oh, Commissioner Hurst,
how nice of you to call.

836
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,497
I do hope that you do your best
to rescue me.

837
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,625
Heh, it'll only make the whole thing
all the more exciting.

838
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:31,045
Don't worry, Uncle Eric,
we'll get you out of this.

839
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:35,128
All right. He's alive.
How long depends on you.

840
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,887
I think, in his own way,
Lassard is telling us...

841
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,644
...that he'd rather risk his own life
than let those animals get away.

842
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,271
Brave man.

843
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,730
Sir. I realize that
this is your jurisdiction...

844
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,897
...but if there's gonna be a rescue attempt,
we'd like to volunteer.

845
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,485
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

846
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,151
Commissioner Murdock,
I couldn't agree more.

847
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:06,698
I think it is vital that the rescue team
know Commandant Lassard intimately.

848
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,833
I can vouch for the skill
of these police officers.

849
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,290
After all, I trained them myself.

850
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,125
Must be the drugs.

851
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:18,418
All right, now this is the floor
where Lassard is being held hostage.

852
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,461
- Captain Harris?
- Yes.

853
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,506
All right, gentlemen.
This is what I want you to do.

854
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,642
And you will do it
exactly as I tell you to do it.

855
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,530
You've tuned to Larvell Jones
on the KWURST radio. And now:

856
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:50,495
The love doctor.
I want you to come here, baby.

857
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,204
Aah!

858
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:55,291
You and me, yeah. All the way.

859
01:08:55,465 --> 01:09:00,210
Come on down. Let's get down, baby,
because I need you. I love you.

860
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,262
That concludes our broadcast day.

861
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,772
Aha.

862
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,737
Whoa.

863
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,584
Why come I got the part with the steps?

864
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,996
I offered you the vent.

865
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,833
- Uh-uh.
- No.

866
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,424
Let's go.

867
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,966
- Hey! Unh!
- Ooh!

868
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,634
Ooh, nice, Kate. Watch this.

869
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,857
Okay.

870
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,741
- A woman's work is never done.
- Come on.

871
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,863
Well, that went off without a hitch.

872
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:47,444
Where is everybody?

873
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,655
I don't get it.

874
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,988
The chopper's here already.

875
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,998
It wasn't supposed to be here for an hour.

876
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:59,082
- Someone must've changed the plans.
- Yeah, Harris.

877
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:06,677
Your plan was brilliant, sir!

878
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,925
Thank you, Proctor.

879
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,092
By giving those incompetents
the diversionary part of this mission...

880
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:17,013
...I've left the real rescue
to the experienced officers...

881
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,056
...namely, <i>moi.</i>

882
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:23,694
I will rescue Lassard,
and I'll get a promotion and a medal.

883
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,783
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

884
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:37,370
- We've got you covered. This is the police.
- Well done, Harris!

885
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:41,958
It was my pleasure, sir.
Now, everyone, drop your guns! Now!

886
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,169
- Proctor, get down there and pick them up.
- Yes, sir.

887
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:50,509
No, no, Proctor, no. Use the ladder.
The ladder!

888
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:58,930
All right! All right, all right, all right!
Come on, give him to me. Give him to me.

889
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,850
That's right.
Hands up, or you've got one dead dork.

890
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:08,572
Nice twist. They're really going all out
this year, aren't they?

891
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,735
Get these guys to the chopper.
All right, I'm going to my boat.

892
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,575
Tell your people,
I see one plane, one chopper, one boat...

893
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,913
...before we reach our rendezvous,
these guys are shark bait. You got it? Huh?

894
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:36,972
- Where's Harris?
- They kidnapped him too.

895
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:42,765
From now on, we do it our way.

896
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,030
We're gonna need some more information.

897
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,238
Well?

898
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,823
I don't know nothing.

899
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:59,490
Oh, I see. Well, I'll tell you, partner...

900
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:03,411
...don't tell me. Tell him.

901
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,546
The boss said to wait here
while he checked on the chopper.

902
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,052
Then you guys showed up,
and that's all I know!

903
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,463
I swear, I swear, I swear it.

904
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:16,844
I'll tell the others.

905
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,681
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- No! No.

906
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,351
- I'm going down now.
- Okay, boss.

907
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,771
You concentrate.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

908
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,189
No problem, boss.

909
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,323
All right, all right. I'm coming down.

910
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,699
That ended my first career.

911
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,037
Then, when I was 12 years old...

912
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:45,668
...I got a job as a boxboy at the A&P.

913
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,626
That was a very, very exciting time for me.

914
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,839
I had many, many, many
interesting experiences.

915
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:57,598
One day, as I was
stacking canned vegetables--

916
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,932
I think it was petit pois.
No, no, creamed corn.

917
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,312
Or was it maybe succotash?

918
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,690
I can't quite remember. No.

919
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,945
Excuse me. Oh, excuse me.
Is there any possibility...

920
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,606
...that I could be held hostage by myself?

921
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,993
Outside would be fine.
I don't mind the breeze.

922
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,529
What's the matter?
You're not enjoying yourself here?

923
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,163
Mm-mm.

924
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:26,077
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
You'll be out of misery in no time.

925
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,961
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

926
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,667
My boss's boat is waiting for me.

927
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,675
As soon as we meet up with him,
I'm gonna sink this baby...

928
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,301
...with you in it.

929
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,010
You'll never get away with this,
you two-bit, filthy scum!

930
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,924
What did he call me?

931
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,809
- Scum.
- Ah.

932
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,438
Well, perhaps you'd like to leave now.
Mouse.

933
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:50,817
Ha-ha-ha.
About that "filthy scum" comment...

934
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,570
Shut up, shark bait.

935
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,903
- Shark bait?
- Hey. Shut up.

936
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,658
What strategy.

937
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,662
Are you quite sure we didn't meet
at the Toronto Convention in '76?

938
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,573
You are one nutty old man.

939
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,374
Hey, Sug, how's it going?

940
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,289
We're getting pretty close, boss.

941
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:16,085
Boss? Mr. Dempsey should be
plenty proud of you, boss.

942
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:19,551
You got the diamonds back. You did it.

943
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:21,507
Yeah.

944
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,263
I did it.

945
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:28,104
I did it. Ha-ha-ha! I did it!

946
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:59,970
- Drop the line.
- Got it.

947
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:05,722
Mr. Dempsey, your merchandise, sir.

948
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,186
You're a good man, Tony.

949
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,723
Finish your business first. Then bring
the diamonds and let's get out of here.

950
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,689
I-- Mr. Dempsey, uh...

951
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:19,489
...the dork, I don't mind,
but, uh, the old man...

952
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,526
No witnesses.

953
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,867
- Don't disappoint me again.
- Yes, sir.

954
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,415
Shit.

955
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,593
Sorry, Mouse, he wouldn't go for it.

956
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,471
Excuse me. Could I say something?

957
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:47,976
- Sure.
- Don't kill me. Mm.

958
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:52,059
I won't tell on your gang.
I won't say a word. You can trust me.

959
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,815
Mm.

960
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,146
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

961
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,940
I'll shoot you second.

962
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,905
Thanks.

963
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:06,321
I just want to say that
this has been a splendid kidnapping.

964
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:10,832
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
I really appreciate that.

965
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:15,541
And I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
You have been one outstanding hostage.

966
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,421
Ah, my pleasure.

967
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:20,254
No, I mean it. Now I gotta kill you.

968
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:21,713
I understand.

969
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,220
Nothing personal. Just business.

970
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,099
What the hell is that?

971
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,142
Take care of them.

972
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,857
Out of my way, dirtbag!

973
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,358
Shit!

974
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,991
All right, all right, you and Sugar
take the weenie for a hostage.

975
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,871
I got the old man. Come on, old man!

976
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:57,542
This way, this way! Come on, come on!
Hurry up, hurry up!

977
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:01,333
Get him! Take him out!

978
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,773
Now, which one of you guys
was resisting arrest?

979
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,059
- Not me.
- Me, either.

980
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,229
- Unh!
- Uncle Eric!

981
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,402
Come on, Tackleberry,
we need some help!

982
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,987
Up ahead, Hightower!

983
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:32,488
Hey!

984
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:41,794
- Keep it steady!
- Get ready to jump!

985
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,254
Okay, go!

986
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:46,010
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

987
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,388
Where the hell have you been?
What took you so long?

988
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,469
I had to change clothes!

989
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,761
Where'd you get those
funny-looking clothes?

990
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,480
Wonderful! Wonderful!

991
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,330
Yeah?

992
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:34,260
<i>Maintain your positions until told otherwise.</i>

993
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:41,066
Over that way. Steady. You got it.

994
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,568
Bombs away!

995
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,984
Here I come! Geronimo!

996
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,533
Uh-oh! Unh!

997
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,744
- Faster! Faster!
- I'm going as fast as I can!

998
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,830
- You're in trouble now. It's a dead end.
- Oh, God.

999
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:48,045
Look out, old man! Aah!

1000
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:53,630
Well done!

1001
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:58,010
- Look out!
- Aah!

1002
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,556
- All right! Ha-ha-ha!
- Ha-ha-ha!

1003
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,282
Yo!

1004
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,345
They probably think they got us!

1005
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,889
- I think we got them!
- There's no way out.

1006
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,897
- They think there's no way out!
- Look out, here he comes.

1007
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,146
- Well done!
- It's nothing.

1008
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,319
Let's get him!

1009
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,998
- Captain Harris.
- Sergeant. Uh...

1010
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,705
I, uh-- I was locked in here
during the fighting.

1011
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,870
- Uh, carry on.
- Yes, sir!

1012
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:11,963
Move it, move it, move it. Let's get these
felons tied up and into police custody.

1013
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:15,595
Proctor! Where is Proctor?

1014
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,632
I'm coming, sir! Aah!

1015
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,391
- Here I come!
- Proctor.

1016
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,723
Proctor! Aah!

1017
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:30,277
I did that.
I'm sorry, sir, my fault! My fault.

1018
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,155
It didn't hurt. Didn't hurt.

1019
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:40,029
Don't just stand there. Get me out of here!

1020
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,992
Move it! Move it! Move it!

1021
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,792
Look out! Gator!

1022
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,586
That gator better watch out.

1023
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,804
- Roll him over, Hightower!
- Aah!

1024
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,654
No!

1025
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,162
- All right!
- Aah!

1026
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,662
Thank God.

1027
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,439
Hey, hey!
Stay where you are. I still got the old man.

1028
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:56,571
- Uncle Eric, are you all right?
- This is awesome!

1029
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,733
It's the best procedure demonstration
in history!

1030
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,902
Uncle Eric, those are real crooks.

1031
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:03,991
Oh!

1032
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,622
Well, in that case...

1033
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:13,625
Nothing personal. Just business.

1034
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:23,390
After capturing
the Mal-Ankh-Ee diamond thieves...

1035
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,767
...and bringing them to justice...

1036
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:29,520
...these officers have been cited
for medals of honor...

1037
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,307
...by the city of Miami.

1038
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:43,492
In addition, one officer selflessly...

1039
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,654
...and at the risk of his life...

1040
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:48,949
...saved Captain Harris from certain death.

1041
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:53,245
He is Sergeant Moses Hightower.

1042
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:02,046
Let them have their little moment.
We know who will have the last laugh.

1043
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:05,681
Uh, yes, we do, Commandant Harris.

1044
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,764
For his remarkable record...

1045
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,681
...this department is proud
to promote Sergeant Hightower...

1046
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:15,601
...to Lieutenant Hightower!

1047
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:21,614
I think it is fitting
that Lieutenant Hightower...

1048
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:27,029
...receive his bars from the very officer
whose life he saved:

1049
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,241
Captain Harris.

1050
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,662
You dork.

1051
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:55,223
Congratulations, Lieutenant Hightower!

1052
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:04,490
It has been a great, great pleasure...

1053
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,199
...serving you as commandant
of this academy.

1054
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,614
I'll miss you all. Farewell.

1055
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:15,707
Godspeed and thank you.

1056
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:27,260
Nothing could please me more
than what I am about to say.

1057
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,970
The governor and I
wish that Eric Lassard...

1058
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,977
...continue as commandant
of this academy...

1059
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:36,856
...until such time as he sees fit
to retire himself.

1060
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,658
Oh, no!

1061
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:52,868
Unh!
