next,

you gentlemen have two choices.

148
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,875
One: Once I'm gone, you could
lift that beast off the
remaining Speck,

149
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,708
then carry him
to the nearest town.

150
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,583
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

151
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:34,458
Or two: You could unshackle
yourselves, take that rifle,

152
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,083
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

153

and then make your way to
a more enlightened area
of this country.

00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,458
Good morning, innkeeper!

178
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,250
Two beers for
two weary travelers.

179
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,083
It's still a bit early.

180
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,583
We won't be open
for another hour.

181
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,750
By then, we'll be
servin' breakfast.

182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,166
[gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa... what the hell you think
you're doing, boy?

183
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,666
Get that nigger outta here!

184
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,958
- [panting] Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

185
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,458
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

186
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,583
[man] Sheriff! Help!

187
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,291
Alas.

188
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,291
Now we must act
as our own bartender.

189
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Sit down, my boy.

190
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,416
- What kind of dentist are you?
- [chortles]

191
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:28,416
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five
years.

192
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,333
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

193
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,916
bounty hunter.

194
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,333
Do you know what
a bounty hunter is?

195
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,125
No.

196
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,541
Well...

197
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:57,041
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

198
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,750
a bounty hunter
deals in corpses.

199
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,125
[tsking] Hat.

200
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,416
Prost.

201
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,083
The state places
a bounty on a man's head.

202
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,958
I track that man, I find
that man, I kill that man.

203
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,083
After I've killed him,
I transport that man's corpse
back to the authorities.

204
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,750
Sometimes that's
easier said than done.

205
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,000
I show that corpse to the
authorities, proving yes,
indeed,

206
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,875
I truly have killed him,

207
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,083
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

208
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,583
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

209
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,208
What's a bounty?

210
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,416
It's like a reward.

211
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:51,041
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

212
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,083
Certain people, yeah.

213
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,416
Bad people?

214
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:58,500
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

215
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,708
Which brings me to you.

216
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:05,000
And I must admit, I'm at a bit
of a quandary when it comes to
you.

217
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,833
On one hand, I despise slavery.

218
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,208
On the other hand,
I need your help.

219
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:15,541
If you're not in a position
to refuse, all the better.

220
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,416
So, for the time being, I'm
gonna make this slavery malarkey

221
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,750
work to my benefit.

222
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,625
Still, having said that,
I feel guilty.

223
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:32,541
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

224
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,416
I'm looking for
the Brittle Brothers.

225
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,458
However, at this endeavor,
I'm at a slight disadvantage

226
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,666
insofar as I don't know
what they look like.

227
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,875
But you do. Don't ya?

228
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,083
I know what they
look like all right.

229
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,666
Good. So here's my agreement.

230
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,458
- You travel with me
until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

231
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,250
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

232
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,250
but I don't know where.

233
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,166
That means we visit every
plantation in Gatlinburg
till we find 'em.

234
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:20,666
And when we find them, you point
them out, and I kill them.

235
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,916
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

236
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:30,083
$25 per Brittle Brother.
That's $75.

237
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:34,083
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

238
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,083
[scoffs]

239
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:47,291
OK, boys. Fun's over.
Come on out.

240
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,500
- [overlapping chatter]
- All right, folks, calm down.

241
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,916
Go about your business.

242
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,541
These jokers will be gone soon.

243
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,916
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

244
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,250
And scare all these nice people.

245
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,916
You ain't got
nothing better to do

246
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,541
than to come into
Bill Sharp's town

247
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,750
and show your ass?

248
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,625
- [metal springing noise]
- [sheriff screaming]

249
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,916
- [crowd gasping]
- [groaning]

250
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,541
[woman screams]

251
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:34,458
- What'd you just do
to our sheriff?
- [groaning]

252
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,458
- [yelling]
- [shot echoing]

253
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,791
[woman gasps]

254
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,958
[crowd screaming]

255
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,750
Now you can get the marshal.

256
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,666
[man] Marshal! Marshal!

257
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,083
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

258
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,375
After you.

259
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:01,000
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the
saloon.

260
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,041
I want six men,
six rifles behind it.

261
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,416
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

262
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,000
Two men, two rifles
on that roof.

263
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,916
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

264
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,291
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

265
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,583
You in the saloon!

266
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,500
We got a hundred rifles aimed at
every way out of that buildin'.

267
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,000
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,291
You and your nigger come out
right now with your hands over
your head,

269
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,083
and I mean right now.

270
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,041
[Schultz] Is this the marshal I
have the pleasure of addressing?

271
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
Yes, it is.

272
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,250
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

273
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,541
[Schultz]
Na wunderbar, marshal.

274
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,833
I have relieved myself
of all weapons,

275
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,833
and just as you have instructed,

276
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,625
I am ready to step outside

277
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,916
with my hands
raised above my head.

278
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,416
I trust as a representative

279
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,750
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America,

280
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:10,083
I shan't be shot down in the
street by either you or your
deputies

281
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,875
before I've had my day in court.

282
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,291
You mean like
you did our sheriff.

283
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,500
Shot him down
like a dog in the street.

284
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,958
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

285
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:25,875
Do I have your word as a lawman
not to shoot me down like a dog
in the street?

286
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,458
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

287
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,583
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

288
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,583
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

289
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,541
They're a little tense
out there.

290
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,416
So don't make any quick
movements, and let me do
the talking.

291
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,208
- [doors squeaking open]
- Come ahead.

292
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,500
You unarmed?

293
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,083
[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

294
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,291
Marshall Tatum, may I address
you and your deputies,

295
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,500
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

296
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,083
as to the incident
that just occurred?

297
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,916
- Go on.
- Thank you.

298
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,125
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

299
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,625
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

300
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,916
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

301
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,416
saw fit to elect as their
sheriff, who went by the
name of Bill Sharp,

302
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:31,250
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

303
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,041
with a price
on his head of $200.

304
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,041
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

305
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,416
The hell, you say!

306
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:42,833
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

307
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,125
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

308
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,833
sometime in the past two years?

309
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,666
Yeah.

310
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,083
[Schultz] I know this
because three years ago,

311
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:57,791
he was rustling cattle from the
B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock, Texas.

312
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:02,000
Now, this is a
warrant made out by.

313
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,875
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

314
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,583
You're encouraged to wire him.

315
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:14,875
He'll back up who I am and who
your dear departed sheriff was.

316
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:18,958
[guns uncocking]

317
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:26,916
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

318
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,000
[medium-tempo song plays]

319
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll be damned.

After this Brittle

you'll be a free man,
with a horse, $75 in
your back pocket...

329
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,625
What's your plan after that?

330
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,750
Find my wife,
and buy her freedom.

331
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:32,250
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

332
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,666
Do most slaves
believe in marriage?

333
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,458
Oh, me and my wife do.

334
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:42,750
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

335
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,666
[man] Django.

336
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,875
Django, Django.

337
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,666
You got sand, Django.

338
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,250
Boy's got sand.

339
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:59,250
I got no use for
a nigger with sand.

340
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,416
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

341
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,583
And the girl, too.

342
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,583
[groaning]

343
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:12,583
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell
'em.

344
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,291
Both of 'em.

345
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,208
Separately.

You'd better give me that arm!
- [screaming]

512
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
You'd better give me that arm!

513
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,000
OK, she's ready!

514
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,291
[whimpering]

515
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,125
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

516
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,416
John Brittle!

517
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,666
- You remember me?
- [metal springing noise]

518
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,958
I like the way you die, boy.

519
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,250
Goddamn son of a bitch!

520
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,083
[grunting]

521
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,208
[whip cracking]

522
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,000
[groaning]

523
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,791
- Keep it funny!
- [grunting]

524
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,416
[yelling]

525
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,000
[man groaning]

526
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,458
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

527
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,041
[cocking pistol]

528
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,041
No! [Groans]

529
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,916
[clicking]

530
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,125
Who were they?

531
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,416
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

532
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,041
Where's Ellis?

533
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,541
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

534
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,916
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

535
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,958
- Positive?
- I don't know.

536
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,166
You don't know
if you're positive?

537
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,166
I don't know what
"positive" mean.

538
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,666
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

539
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,250
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's
Ellis Brittle.

540
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,083
I'm positive he dead.

541
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,083
Django!

542
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,291
Everybody calm down.

543
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,791
We mean no one else any harm.

544
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,500
Who are you two jokers?

545
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,708
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

546
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,500
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America.

547
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,291
The man to my left is Django
Freeman. He's my deputy.

548
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,291
In my pocket is a warrant,

549
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:45,583
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of
Austin, Texas,

550
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:49,708
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

551
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:54,791
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

552
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,333
They were goin'
by the name Shaffer.

553
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:02,750
You know them by the name of
Shaffer, but the butchers' real
name was Brittle.

554
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,541
These are wanted men.

555
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,041
The law wants 'em for murder.

556
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:10,333
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

557
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,750
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

558
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,416
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

559
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:22,916
I realize passions are high,

560
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:27,166
but I must warn you, the penalty
for taking deadly force

561
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,750
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

562
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,750
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

563
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:41,583
Now, may I please remove the
warrant from my pocket so you
may examine it?

564
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,750
Gimme.

565
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,666
Satisfied?

566
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,500
May I have that back, please?

567
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:20,083
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

568
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:25,291
Load up the bodies as quickly
as you can and let's get outta
here.

569
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,791
[Schultz whistling indistinctly]

570
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:54,625
Yeah, that's them
sons-a-bitches.

571
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:05,833
[galloping hoofbeats]

572
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:12,083
- [dramatic choral music]
- [horses snorting, whinnying]

573
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,875
[men yelling, whooping]

574
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,958
Come on, men!

575
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:41,666
- [man 1] We're coming for you,
nigger!
- [man 2] Hee-haw!

576
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:55,291
Now, unless they start shootin'
first, nobody shoot 'em.

577
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,208
That's way too simple
for these jokers.

578
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:01,000
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

579
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,291
And I'm gonna personally strip
and clip that garboon myself.

580
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,291
Damn.

581
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,291
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

582
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,541
We ready or what?

583
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,916
[Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

584
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,625
- [fabric ripping]
- Oh... Oh, shit.

585
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,833
I just made it worse.

586
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,125
Who made this goddamn shit?

587
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,333
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own
goddamn masks!

588
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:34,125
Look, nobody's sayin' they don't
appreciate what Jenny did.

589
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,750
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

590
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,333
I coulda cut it
better than this!

591
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:42,958
- What about you, Robert?
Can you see?
- Not too good.

592
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:47,166
I mean, if I don't move my head
I can see you pretty good, more
or less.

593
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:51,166
But when I start ridin',
the bag's movin' all over,
and I'm ridin' blind.

594
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,375
- Shit.
- [man] Yeah.

595
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:55,666
I just made mine worse.

596
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,583
Oh, God.

597
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,375
Anybody bring any extra bags?

598
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,458
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

599
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,208
I'm just askin'.

600
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:07,458
- Do we have to wear 'em
when we ride?
- Oh, well, shitfire!

601
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,750
If you don't wear 'em as
you ride up, that just defeats
the purpose!

602
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,875
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

603
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,750
I can't breathe in this fuckin'
thing and I can't ride in this
fuckin' thing!

604
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,250
Well, fuck all y'all!
I'm goin' home!

605
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,958
Now, I watched my wife work all
day gettin' 30 bags together

606
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,500
for you ungrateful
sons-a-bitches,

607
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,416
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

608
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:32,000
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

609
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:36,000
Now, look, let's not
forget why we're here.

610
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,208
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

611
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,625
And we gotta make
a lesson out of him.

612
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:44,791
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

613
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:49,708
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

614
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,041
- Yeah.
- [mumbling agreements]

615
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:53,083
But, not pointin' any fingers,

616
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,000
they coulda been done better.

617
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:59,750
So how 'bout no bags this time,

618
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,750
but next time we do the bags
right and then we go full
regalia.

619
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,041
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

620
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:10,541
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

621
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:14,041
- But nobody can see.
- So?

622
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,041
So it'd be nice to see.

623
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:20,750
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

624
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:26,541
So what? All that matters is
can the fuckin' horse see!
That's a raid!

625
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:29,416
- [overlapping shouts]
- [man] Sons of bitches!

626
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,958
I can't see shit!

627
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:36,250
[Big Daddy] There he is!
Get that nigger out
from under that wagon!

628
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,500
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

629
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,250
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

630
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,083
- What?
- They tricked us!

631
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,250
Well, where are they?

632
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,875
Auf Wiedersehen.

633
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:48,583
- [all shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

634
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,250
Oh! [Chuckles]

635
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,375
Bull's-eye.

636
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,250
- [men yelling]
- [horses whinnying]

637
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,750
- [Django] Look at 'em run.
- [all shouting]

638
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

639
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,083
Goddamn it!

640
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,500
[Big Daddy] Goddamn it!

641
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,916
Would you care to?

642
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,791
Can't see shit outta this!

643
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,291
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

644
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,750
[Schultz]
Big Daddy's getting away.

645
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,250
I got him.

646
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,125
- [slow-motion impact sound]
- [Big Daddy grunting]

647
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,541
Got him.

648
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,333
[chuckles] The kid's a natural.

649
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,750
[animal yipping nearby]

650
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,875
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

651
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,250
Broomhilda is a German name.

652
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,958
If they named her, it stands
to reason they'd be German.

653
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,375
Lots of gals where
you're from named Broomhilda?

654
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,375
Broomhilda is the name
of a character

655
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:31,208
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

656
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,583
There's a story
about Broomhilda?

657
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,375
Oh, yes, there is.

658
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,000
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows
that story.

659
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,708
Would you like me to tell you?

660
00:46:54,083 --> 00:47:00,208
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

661
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:07,000
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

662
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,416
Anyway, her father
is really mad at her.

663
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,583
What she do?

664
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,208
I can't exactly remember.

665
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:17,041
She disobeys him in some way.

666
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,416
So he puts her
on top of the mountain.

667
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:22,125
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

668
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:23,625
It's a German legend,

669
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,541
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

670
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:30,833
And he puts a fire-breathing
dragon there to guard the
mountain.

671
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,541
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

672
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:43,333
And there,
Broomhilda shall remain.

673
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:47,750
Unless a hero arises

674
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,916
brave enough to save her.

675
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:52,458
Does a fella arise?

676
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:55,750
Yes, Django,
as a matter of fact, he does.

677
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,583
A fella named Siegfried.

678
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,666
Does Siegfried save her?

679
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:04,583
Quite spectacularly so.

He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

681
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,583
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

682
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,166
And he walks through hellfire...

683
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,875
because Broomhilda's
worth it.

Greenville in a good conscience.

killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

698
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,583
but normally,
that's a good thing.

partner up for the winter?

You work with me through the
winter till the snow melts...

702
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:46,583
I give you
a third of my bounties.

703
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,750
So we make some money this
winter, and when the snow melts,

704
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,791
I'll take you
to Greenville myself

705
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:57,166

where they sent your wife.

706
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,166

707

Why you care if I find my wife?

708
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,500
Frankly...

709
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,625
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

710
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:17,708
And now that I have, I feel
vaguely responsible for you.

00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:21,583

01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,416
Not for top dollar.

1020
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:07,416
Well, then, we got nothin'
more to talk about.

1021
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:09,833
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

1022
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,291
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

1023
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:14,166
He don't wanna buy
the niggers you wanna sell.

1024
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:18,583
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

1025
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:23,083
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

1026
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:28,875
Well, you won't sell your best.

1027
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,458
You won't even
sell your second best.

1028
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:35,291
But your third best...? You
don't want to sell him either.

1029
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:40,083
But if I made you an offer
so ridiculous you'd be forced
to consider it...

1030
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,250
[chortles]
...who knows what could happen?

1031
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:46,916
And what do you
consider ridiculous?

1032
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:52,000
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

1033
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,791
How much would you say, Django?

1034
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:00,916
Twelve thousand dollars.

1035
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,291
[straw slurping]

1036
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:09,416
Well, gentlemen,
you had my curiosity,

1037
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:11,500
but now you have my attention.

1038
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:30,291
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

1039
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:33,000
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

1040
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a
better one.

1041
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,208
Please, won't you take a ride
with us here in the Victoria.

1042
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:41,708
[Schultz]
Oh, thank you very much.

1043
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:44,208
You can tie your horse up
back there.

1044
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:53,750
[Calvin] Django.

1045
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:02,041
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

1046
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:07,416
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

1047
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:11,750
above loyal that
a nigger can aspire to.

1048
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:16,625
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

1049
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,250
The exceptional nigger.

1050
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,333
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

1051
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,625
Sun is up.

1052
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:26,666
Shining on all of us.

1053
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:34,375
- [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.
- [Schultz] Thank you.

1054
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,875
Quite an honor.

1055
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,666
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

1056
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:41,250
[Calvin] But I do believe that,
given time,

1057
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,375
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

1058
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,166
become if not frequent...

1059
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,083
more frequent.

1060
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:56,375
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

1061
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:59,916
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

1062
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:02,083
[men laughing]

1063
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,916
- Whoa!
- [whinnying]

1064
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:18,416
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

1065
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:20,583
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

1066
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:23,916
- Are you kidding me?
This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

1067
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,791
Now take your hand
off your pistol!

1068
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:30,708
Butch, that means you too.

1069
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,916
Everybody stop
antagonizing my guest.

1070
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,250
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

1071
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,916
He broke my collarbone!

1072
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:45,250
For God's sake, somebody please
help Hoot here back up on his
goddamn horse.

1073
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,541
- [man] Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are
one lucky nigger.

1074
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,333
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

1075
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:53,958
Oh, I'm gonna go walking
in the moonlight with you.

1076
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:55,916
You wanna hold my hand?

1077
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,333

1105
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,416
Indeed.

1106
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:38,333
May we stop for a moment so I
may put a word in my man's ear?

1107
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:42,250
You know, I'm expecting to fall
in love once I see the specimens
at Candyland,

1108
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:45,458
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1109
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:50,083
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1110
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,666
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1111
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:57,083
I confirmed that
Broomhilda's at Candyland.

1112
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:03,500
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1113
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,166
but she's a young lady,
whip marks on her back
and speaks German.

1114
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:09,083
Now, while it's
not wise to assume,

1115
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,583
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1116
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:16,500
Point being, don't get
so carried away with your
retribution.

1117
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,500
You lose sight
of why we're here.

sight of that?

Stop antagonizing Candie.

1120

charade, or more than likely get
us both killed.

to die in Chickasaw County,
Mississippi, USA.

I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1124
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:45,708
I recall the man who had me kill
another man in front of his son

1125
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,708
and he didn't bat a eye.

1126

You remember that?

1127
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:53,833
Yeah, of course I remember.

1128
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:58,333
What you said was that
this is my world...

1129
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:01,250
and in my world
you gotta get dirty.

1130
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,333
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1131
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,125
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad,
but...

1132
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,041
that was the general gist.

please shut these goddamn dogs
up?

[D'Artagnan weeping] Please,
Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it
in me no more.

When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a

- 'fore he roll over
and play dead.
- Sir.

You have to understand that
I'm runnin' a business here.

- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

Still, the fact remains:

01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:41,125
I pay $500,
I want five goddamn fights!

1178

what "reimburse" means?

1182
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:01,375
- [laughing]
- [Calvin] Huh?

1183
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:05,666
[laughter continues]

1184
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:09,375
I'll reimburse you!

1185
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,375
You will?

1186
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:17,083
Yep.

1187
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:22,500
You'll pay $500

1188
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,208
for practically a one-eyed old
Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

1189
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:27,500
No, he won't.

1190
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:31,791
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1191
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,583
Matter of fact, so am I.

1192
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:37,083
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1193
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:39,291
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1194
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,208
You heard him.

1195
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:55,041
You're gonna have to excuse Mr.
Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1196
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:59,416
He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life.

1197
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,833
Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?

1198
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:05,416
That right.

1199
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,833
[Calvin] For that matter...

1200
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,625
nor have I.

1201
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,916
Now...

1202
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:22,250
seein' as you won't pay
a penny for this pickaninny
here...

1203
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:28,083
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1204
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:30,750
He's your nigger.

1205
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:37,250
Mr. Stonesipher?

1206
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:41,250
Let Marsha and her bitches send
D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1207
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:46,250
- Marsha!
Marsha, hey, get him!
- [barks echoing]

1208
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,958
Get 'im, get 'im!

1209
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:53,583
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1210
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,083
Whoo-ee!

1211
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
- [dogs snarling]
- [screaming]

1212
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,500
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1213
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,500
for a blood sport
like nigger fighting.

1214
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:32,750
Nah, he just ain't used to
seein' a man ripped apart
by dogs is all.

1215
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:34,541
Hm.

1216
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,916
You are used to it?

1217
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:41,333
- I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.
- Hm.

1218
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:44,916
Now, Monsieur Candie...

1219
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:46,625
whenever you're ready.

1220
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:51,250
We rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's get
to it.

1221
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:57,750
'Cause as of now, if he's
an example, I ain't impressed.

1222
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,333
Follow me.

1223
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:15,666
[snarling]

1224
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,958
[clucking]

1225
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,250
[nickering]

1226
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:01,375
Line 'em up to
the left here now, boy.

1227
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,375
Stand up straight, now!

1228
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:06,750
Get up there.

1229
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,458
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1230
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:11,250
Give me a line!
Give me a line!

1231
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,583
Get in line there!
Straighten up!

1232
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:13,125
[indistinct chatter]

1233
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:14,750
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1234
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:17,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1235
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,750
Who this nigger
up on that nag?

1236
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:24,250
Stephen, you have nails for
breakfast? What's-a matter?
Why you so ornery?

1237
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,958
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir. [Laughs]

1238
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:30,250
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1239
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:34,666
- Like a baby miss mammy's
titty.
- [all chuckling]

1240
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:38,583
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1241
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:40,791
[laughing]

1242
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:45,583
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1243
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,458
Hey, Snowball?

1244
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:52,166
Wanna know my name or the name
of my horse, you ask me.

1245
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:54,875
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1246
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:57,583
I'll snatch your black ass
off that nag there and in
the mud so fast,

1247
01:28:57,583 --> 01:29:00,833
- make your head spin.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stephen,
Stephen, Stephen.

1248
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:05,208
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a Freeman.

1249
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,625
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1250
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:10,083
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1251
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:14,208
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself,
Stephen.

1252
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:17,500
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1253
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:21,583
Calvin, just who the hell is
this nigger you feels the need
to entertain?

1254
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:25,583
Django and his friend
in gray here, Dr. Schultz,
are customers.

1255
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:29,583
And they are our guests,
Stephen. And you, you old
decrepit bastard,

1256
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:31,083
oughta show them
every hospitality.

1257
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,625
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1258
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:35,416
But I don't know why I got to
take lip off this nigger.

1259
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:38,333
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1260
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:40,750
Yessir. I understand.

1261
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,333
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1262
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:45,750
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1263
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:48,458
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1264
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,625
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1265
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:53,666
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem
with that?

1266
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:56,125
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1267
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:58,333
if you ain't got no problem with
burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1268
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:00,750
the pillowcases, everything else
when this black-ass
motherfucker's gone!

1269
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:03,250
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1270
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,625
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1271
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,666
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1272
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:09,583
and get them
goddamn rooms ready!

1273
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,583
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1274
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,375
Go on, now.

1275
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:19,583
Can't believe you brought a
nigger to stay in The Big House.

1276
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:21,083
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1277
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:24,750
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1278
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,083
Now...

1279
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:30,708
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1280
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:33,958
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1281
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:39,416
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed
sister.

1282
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:43,583
Darlin', you are
a tonic for tired eyes.

1283
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:48,125
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1284
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:51,750
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that
pen.

1285
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,083
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1286
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:55,208
You know where it is.

1287
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:57,083
Like you on a rope!

1288
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:01,500
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1289
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,791
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1290
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:08,750
Yeah. About that matter about
the nigger girl you were talking
about?

1291
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:13,333
- Nigger gal?
- Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1292
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:15,750
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1293
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:20,041
Do you think before the
demonstration, you could
send her around to my room?

1294
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:24,416
[laughs] You little dickens,
you. I don't see why not.

1295
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:28,041
Stephen, when you get through
showin' them to their rooms,
go fetch Hildi,

1296
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:30,125
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1297
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:31,750
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1298
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,541
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1299
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,250
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1300
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:40,125
- What?
- [stammers] Uh, Hildi
in the Hot Box.

1301
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:42,833
[Calvin] What's she doin' there?

1302
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:45,750
[Stephen] What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1303
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,375
She bein' punished.

1304
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:49,791
- [Calvin] What she do?
- [Stephen] She run off again.

1305
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:52,666
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many
people ran away while I was
gone?

1306
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:55,458
- Two.
- When did she go?

1307
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:58,083
Last night. They brung her back
this morning.

1308
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:01,583
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1309
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:05,375
[Stephen] Lucky for her, they
was out chasin' D'Artagnan's
ass.

1310
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:09,875
Bill and Cody went lookin' for
her, found her, brung her back.

1311
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:12,958
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own
damn self

1312
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,208
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1313
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,083
[Calvin]
How long she been in the box?

1314
01:32:16,083 --> 01:32:19,083
[Stephen] How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1315
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,833
And the little bitch got
ten more days to be in there.

1316
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:25,208
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1317
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:29,250
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1318
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:33,583
Hildi is my nigger.
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1319
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:36,833
- But, Monsieur Candie,
she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1320
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,500
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1321
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,291
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1322
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:46,583
Now, I realize it is
inconvenient, but still,
you take her ass out.

1323
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:47,791
Yessir.

1324
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:51,791
[Calvin] Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1325
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:55,416
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz
here.

1326
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:57,041
[Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.

1327
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:58,416
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize,

1328
01:32:58,416 --> 01:33:01,833
but I am weary from
our travels beyond words.

1329
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:05,041
It is time for me
to rest my tired eyes.

1330
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,541
[clucking]

1331
01:33:09,541 --> 01:33:12,625
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1332
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:15,041
Cora! Come here!

1333
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:18,250
Get over there and get her
cleaned up, bring her back
over here to Dr...

1334
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:21,041
- What he say your name is?
Shoots?
- Schultz.

1335
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:23,541
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1336
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:27,250
- Yessir.
- [soft guitar music plays]

1337
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
[Hildi screams]

1338
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:13,500
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1339
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:16,083
[Hildi yelling]

1340
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:19,791
[gasping, screaming]

1341
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:23,500
[sobbing]

1342
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:47,125
Is you comin' with me or is you
gonna sleep in that little box
over yonder?

1343
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:52,541
[slow-tempo song plays]

1344
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,625
[woman sings
in foreign language]

1345
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,541
[exhales]

1346
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:23,750
Hello, ladies.

1347
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:27,250
Dr. Schultz. May I introduce
to you Broomhilda?

1348
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,916
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1349
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:38,333
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Broomhilda.

1350
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:40,666
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1351
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:43,625
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1352
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:45,916
- [chuckles]
- [forced chuckle]

1353
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:48,750
As I look at you now,
Broomhilda,

1354
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:54,250
I can see all the passions
you inspire are completely
justified.

1355
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:59,875
The doctor here speaks German.

1356
01:37:01,666 --> 01:37:03,875
And I've been informed
you do as well?

1357
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,583
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1358
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:13,250
[speaking German]

1359
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,666
Ha! [Laughs]

1360
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:17,875
Astonishing.

1361
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,666
[speaking German]

1362
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:27,083
- And I shall bring you...
- [Schultz] Much obliged.

1363
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:37,708
Ja.

1364
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,916
[speaks German]

1365
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:02,541
Don't be afraid.

1366
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:43,166
Hm. Pardon.

1367
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:52,083
Danke.

1368
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,541
[chuckling]

1369
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,083
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1370
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,291
[gasping]

1371
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:44,916
[moaning]

1372
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:52,083
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1373
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:53,791
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1374
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:55,500
No, no, no,
they drinkin' tonight.

1375
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,208
Go downstairs, get the big jug
with the red stuff Monsieur
Candie like, hear?

1376
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:01,291
- Get your big pretty ass
out the way.
- You know you like it.

1377
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:04,500
- [laughs] That's 'cause
you knows what I like.
- Ooh!

1378
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,541
Come on with these biscuits,
girl.

1379
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:12,291
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt
about it.

1380
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:17,125
But the best three by far
were Samson...

1381
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,958
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1382
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:23,250
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1383
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:26,333
By the way, why is
he called Eskimo Joe?

1384
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:29,416
[chuckles] You never know how
these nigger nicknames get
started.

1385
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:32,166
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1386
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:34,333
[all laugh]

1387
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:41,166
Well, regardless, Samson's
your best. We all know that.

1388
01:41:41,166 --> 01:41:45,916
- You will never sell him, and
I can see why. He's a champion.
- Hm-hm.

1389
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:49,458
All three are champions.

1390
01:41:49,458 --> 01:41:51,750
Samson's the champion.

1391
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,750
Them other two pretty good.

1392
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:56,583
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1393
01:41:56,583 --> 01:41:57,791
It's all right, it's all right.

1394
01:41:57,791 --> 01:42:00,083
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1395
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:03,458
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1396
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:07,958
I do have a little bit of a
background in the European
traveling circus.

1397
01:42:07,958 --> 01:42:13,583
- Is that right?
- Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1398
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:17,375
- Hm.
- I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1399
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:21,083
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1400
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:24,416
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1401
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:27,416
- A sense of showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1402
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:30,916
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1403
01:42:30,916 --> 01:42:32,583
[all chuckling]

1404
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:35,416
- The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?
- More like Nigger-les.

1405
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:37,583
[laughing]

1406
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:43,583
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1407
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:46,500
'the right nigger.'".

1408
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:51,000
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo
Joe is the wrong nigger, per se.

1409
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,833
But is he right as rain?

1410
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:56,541
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1411
01:42:56,541 --> 01:43:00,458
I will have you know there is
no one in the nigger fight game

1412
01:43:00,458 --> 01:43:02,416
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1413
01:43:02,416 --> 01:43:05,625
- more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.
- Nobody.

1414
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:07,541
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1415
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:09,041
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1416
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:12,625
- And that is a nigger
that can win fights.
- Hm-mm.

1417
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:17,041
Now that should be your first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth
concern.

1418
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:19,250
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1419
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:23,416
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1420
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:26,250
In other words,
first thing is first.

1421
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,875
First thing's first.

1422
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,250
[whispers in German]

1423
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,875
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1424
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:41,458
Famously.

1425
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:44,166
Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't
imagine what it's like

1426
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:47,666
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1427
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:49,750
Well, hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.

1428
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:51,875
[laughing]

1429
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:57,250
- Two weeks in Boston!
Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- [coughing]

1430
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,083
[Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!

1431
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:04,500
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1432
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:08,750
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1433
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,708
[Calvin] Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1434
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:13,708
- You might-a caught yourself
a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1435
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:16,291
- [Calvin] Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.
- [Stephen] Hm!

1436
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:19,916
It's like a pool of black tar.
Once it catches your ass,
you're caught.

1437
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:23,083
Yessir, you stuck. [Laughs]

1438
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:24,750
[Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.

1439
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:27,125
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1440
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:32,083
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1441
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:34,125
[Lara Lee giggles]

1442
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:36,750
Well, naturally.

1443
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:40,333
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1444
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:43,416
- not the plucked chicken.
- [all chuckle]

1445
01:44:43,416 --> 01:44:46,125
[Calvin] Dr. Schultz,
don't be so down on yourself.

1446
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:48,166
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1447
01:44:48,166 --> 01:44:49,625
[Cora]
You got to clean these dishes,

1448
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:51,750
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1449
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,125
You know that nigger, don't you?

1450
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,166
- Who?
- "Who?"

1451
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:59,416
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1452
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,125
At the table?

1453
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:04,541
I don't know him.

1454
01:45:04,541 --> 01:45:07,750
- You don't know him.
- No.

1455
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:10,875
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1456
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:13,958
[chuckles]

1457
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,958
You wouldn't lie to me, now,
would you?

1458
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,375
OK.

1459
01:45:24,458 --> 01:45:27,750
Yeah. If you say so.

1460
01:45:33,583 --> 01:45:38,791
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1461
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:44,083
But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1462
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:46,583
What would your price be?

1463
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:48,791
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1464
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:52,416
and I don't know why I would
be inclined to be generous...

1465
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,583
9,000. Maybe.

1466
01:45:57,708 --> 01:46:00,791
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify

1467
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:03,583
how this whole
negotiation came about.

1468
01:46:03,583 --> 01:46:05,708
You see, it wasn't me who
came to you to sell a nigger.

1469
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:08,791
- Sure wasn't.
- It was you who
approached me to buy one.

1470
01:46:08,791 --> 01:46:11,208
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure.

1471
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:13,916
Bright Boy's been bandyin'
about, that ain't too far off
from right.

1472
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:15,750
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1473
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:18,541
- I could do so any day
of the week.
- Any day.

1474
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:23,666
But, like you said in
Greenville, doctor...
I don't want to sell him.

1475
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:27,916
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1476
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:30,916
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1477
01:46:35,416 --> 01:46:38,666
[deep inhale]

1478
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:43,125
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of
persuasion.

1479
01:46:43,125 --> 01:46:44,625
[chuckles]

1480
01:46:46,625 --> 01:46:49,250
[slamming table] Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have
a deal.

1481
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:53,666
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- [banging table] Hooray,
doctor. Hooray.

1482
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:55,375
And a wise decision that is.

1483
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:59,083
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1484
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:02,458
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1485
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:04,291
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1486
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:07,583
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1487
01:47:07,583 --> 01:47:10,750
before I'd feel comfortable
exchanging that amount of money
for flesh.

1488
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:13,750
- Hm-mm.
- Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1489
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:16,708
- by a physician of my choosing.
- [Calvin] Naturally.

1490
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:21,500
So, say I return in about...

1491
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:25,916
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1492
01:47:25,916 --> 01:47:27,291
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1493
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:29,500
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1494
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,333
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1495
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:36,583
I say splendid, doctor.
Splendid.

1496
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,500
Gentlemen...

1497
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:41,500
may I propose a toast.

1498
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:48,750
To Eskimo Joe. Or shall
we call him The Black Hercules?

1499
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:51,583
- [all chuckling]
- To The Black Hercules.

1500
01:47:51,583 --> 01:47:53,083
[Stephen] The Black Hercules.

1501
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:54,750
[speaks low]
To The Black Hercules.

1502
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:58,750
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass.
[chuckles]

1503
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:00,333
Hm.

1504
01:48:00,333 --> 01:48:03,750
Hildi, top my drink off.

1505
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:11,833
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big
House, huh?

1506
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:14,916
When Monsieur Candie
talk to you, you answers.

1507
01:48:14,916 --> 01:48:18,125
- I like it a lot,
Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1508
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:22,541
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your
ass through a bramble bush.

1509
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:25,541
But maybe it's not quite as much
fun as gettin' to pleasure all
them Mandingos,

1510
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:27,458
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them
niggers.

1511
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:28,958
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1512
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:32,166
- [Hildi] No, sir.
- You know, Monsieur Candie,

1513
01:48:32,166 --> 01:48:35,958
the doctor here might
be interested in seein'
Hildi's peeled back,

1514
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:39,000
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1515
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,750
Dr. Schultz, when you
was alone with Hildi, here,

1516
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:44,666
did you just speak German or did
you get to take her clothes off?

1517
01:48:44,666 --> 01:48:49,166
- No, we just talked and...
- [Calvin] Oh, so you haven't
seen her back?

1518
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:51,250
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1519
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:53,458
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1520
01:48:53,458 --> 01:48:56,666
Hildi, go on, take off your
dress. Show Dr. Schultz your
back here.

1521
01:48:56,666 --> 01:48:58,791
- Go on.
- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.

1522
01:48:58,791 --> 01:49:01,416
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1523
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:04,416
[Calvin] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1524
01:49:04,416 --> 01:49:07,708
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1525
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:10,416
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1526
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:14,208
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1527
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:16,500
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1528
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,583
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1529
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:19,916
- [Stephen] Sure would.
- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.

1530
01:49:19,916 --> 01:49:22,916
- It's like a paintin'.
Look at that.
- Calvin!

1531
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:26,208
We are eating. Ain't no one
wanna look at her whipped up
back.

1532
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:30,041
- [exhales]
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1533
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:33,000
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1534
01:49:33,916 --> 01:49:36,041
During the brandies,
gentlemen, hm?

1535
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:44,041
[Lara Lee]
Cora, come get this girl!

1536
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:47,041
[approaching footsteps]

1537
01:49:47,041 --> 01:49:50,541
- [Lara Lee] She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. [Gasps] Oh!

1538
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:53,250
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1539
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:54,750
Come on in here.

1540
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:05,083
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind
side.

1541
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:07,166
You say you ain't know him.

1542
01:50:08,166 --> 01:50:09,458
Huh?

1543
01:50:09,458 --> 01:50:15,166
I said, you said
you ain't know him.

1544
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:19,666
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1545
01:50:21,666 --> 01:50:23,458
Mr. Stephen...

1546
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,500
I don't.

1547
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,166
Why is you lying to me?

1548
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,916
I ain't.

1549
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:34,583
Then why is you crying?

1550
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:36,666
You scarin' me.

1551
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:42,291
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1552
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:45,708
[Schultz] To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1553
01:50:45,708 --> 01:50:48,916
was positively soul-enriching.

1554
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:52,083
[Calvin] Doctor, that warms
my heart to hear that.

1555
01:50:52,083 --> 01:50:55,083
You stay right here.

1556
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:04,791
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with
Hildi.

1557
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:07,916
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1558
01:51:09,916 --> 01:51:15,916
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1559
01:51:15,916 --> 01:51:17,416
I'm all ears.

1560
01:51:17,416 --> 01:51:19,333
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1561
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:21,416
- Monsieur Candie...
- [Calvin] Stephen!

1562
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:25,041
You just interrupted
Dr. Schultz here.

1563
01:51:25,958 --> 01:51:28,250
[Stephen]
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1564
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:31,125
My ears ain't
worth a damn these days.

1565
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:32,541
Excuse him.

1566
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:36,541
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1567
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:38,416
You mean get up out of my chair?

1568
01:51:38,416 --> 01:51:42,041
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1569
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:45,916
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1570
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:48,958
I'd rather discuss that
in private.

1571
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:50,666
We're having white cake!

1572
01:51:50,666 --> 01:51:53,375
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1573
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:57,958
You right, Monsieur Candie. You
right. I'll handle it myself.

1574
01:51:57,958 --> 01:51:59,666
[whispers]
Meet me in the library.

1575
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:03,000
I just can't understand why
you won't come talk to these
niggers.

1576
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,958
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1577
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:10,250
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1578
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,375
Yessir.

1579
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:15,958
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1580
01:52:15,958 --> 01:52:17,958
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1581
01:52:17,958 --> 01:52:21,916
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1582
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:23,416
[all chuckle]

1583
01:52:24,708 --> 01:52:26,708
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1584
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:35,791
[Calvin] You may clear
the dinner service.

1585
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:39,291
[Cora] You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1586
01:52:39,291 --> 01:52:45,041
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the
circus.

1587
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:47,916
[chuckles] The circus?

1588
01:52:47,916 --> 01:52:49,583
[fire crackling]

1589
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:56,125
What is the matter?

1590
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:06,458
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1591
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:10,041
- They wants that girl.
- [chuckling]

1592
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:13,125
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1593
01:53:13,125 --> 01:53:16,333
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1594
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:20,333
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1595
01:53:20,333 --> 01:53:22,625
They here for that girl.

1596
01:53:22,625 --> 01:53:25,250
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1597
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:29,250
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1598
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:32,375
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1599
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:34,958
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1600
01:53:34,958 --> 01:53:37,666
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1601
01:53:37,666 --> 01:53:40,083
But he's just about to buy

1602
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:43,458
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1603
01:53:43,458 --> 01:53:46,666
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1604
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:54,958
Where you gettin' all this?

1605
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:56,916
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1606
01:53:56,916 --> 01:53:59,666
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1607
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:04,125
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1608
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:06,000
She probably his wife.

1609
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,083
Now, why that German
gives a fuck who that
uppity son of a bitch

1610
01:54:09,083 --> 01:54:12,291
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1611
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:17,291
If she's who they want...

1612
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:21,791
why this whole snake oil
pitch about Mandingos, then?

1613
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:25,416
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1614
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:31,083
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1615
01:54:33,708 --> 01:54:35,541
Yes, it did.

1616
01:54:38,625 --> 01:54:40,416
His wife, huh?

1617
01:54:44,041 --> 01:54:47,958
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1618
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:49,541
[chuckles]

1619
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:53,916
Those lying...

1620
01:54:53,916 --> 01:55:00,125
goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1621
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,416
Sons of bitches!

1622
01:55:03,416 --> 01:55:05,125
[Lara Lee]
...out of New Orleans,

1623
01:55:05,125 --> 01:55:09,958
so I have quite a bit of
practice with theater types.

1624
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:11,583
Oh, there you are.

1625
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:14,666
I was beginning to think that
you and that old crow run off
together.

1626
01:55:14,666 --> 01:55:16,166
[all chuckling]

1627
01:55:16,166 --> 01:55:18,458
That'd be a hell of a note,
wouldn't it?

1628
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:21,750
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1629
01:55:21,750 --> 01:55:25,000
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1630
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,250
trying to sell
a passel of ponies.

1631
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:27,583
Would you be a dear,
go out there

1632
01:55:27,583 --> 01:55:30,375
and give them gals
an eyeball? Hm?

1633
01:55:30,375 --> 01:55:32,958
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1634
01:55:45,791 --> 01:55:49,791
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1635
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:54,708
Apropos, before your exit,

1636
01:55:54,708 --> 01:55:58,916
we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing
Broomhilda.

1637
01:55:58,916 --> 01:56:02,000
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1638
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,208
And we will again. In a moment.

1639
01:56:20,625 --> 01:56:22,833
Who's your little friend?

1640
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:26,250
[clearing throat]

1641
01:56:27,541 --> 01:56:30,250
This is Ben.

1642
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:35,625
He's a old Joe that lived
around here for a long time.

1643
01:56:35,625 --> 01:56:37,625
And I do mean a long damn time.

1644
01:56:39,083 --> 01:56:43,041
Old Ben here
took care of my daddy...

1645
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,833
and my daddy's daddy.

1646
01:56:45,833 --> 01:56:48,666
Till he up and
keeled over one day...

1647
01:56:51,291 --> 01:56:53,166
Old Ben took care of me.

1648
01:56:55,666 --> 01:56:59,583
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1649
01:56:59,583 --> 01:57:05,666
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1650
01:57:06,916 --> 01:57:12,458
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1651
01:57:13,666 --> 01:57:17,583
surrounded by black faces.

1652
01:57:19,458 --> 01:57:22,000
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1653
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,291
I only had one question:

1654
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:31,500
- Why don't they kill us?
- [laughs]

1655
01:57:34,083 --> 01:57:39,500
Now, right out there on that
porch, three times a week
for 50 years,

1656
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:44,708
Old Ben here would shave my
daddy with a straight razor.

1657
01:57:44,708 --> 01:57:49,916
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1658
01:57:49,916 --> 01:57:53,583
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1659
01:57:55,916 --> 01:57:57,750
But he never did.

1660
01:57:59,416 --> 01:58:00,833
Why not?

1661
01:58:01,916 --> 01:58:07,041
You see, the science
of phrenology

1662
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:12,250
is crucial to understanding the
separation of our two species.

1663
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:17,625
In the skull
of the African here,

1664
01:58:17,625 --> 01:58:20,041
the area associated
with submissiveness

1665
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:25,750
is larger than any human or any
other subhuman species on planet
Earth.

1666
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,583
[sawing]

1667
01:58:41,083 --> 01:58:43,250
If you examine...

1668
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:46,750
this piece of skull here...

1669
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:56,666
you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1670
01:59:00,083 --> 01:59:03,916
Here, here and here.

1671
01:59:03,916 --> 01:59:05,416
Now...

1672
01:59:05,416 --> 01:59:10,500
if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1673
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:13,208
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1674
01:59:13,208 --> 01:59:17,208
most associated with...
creativity.

1675
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:19,625
But this is the skull
of Old Ben.

1676
01:59:19,625 --> 01:59:22,000
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1677
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,083
unburdened by genius,

1678
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:28,791
these three dimples exist
in the area of the skull
most associated with...

1679
01:59:29,791 --> 01:59:31,208
servility.

1680
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,666
Now, Bright Boy...

1681
01:59:34,666 --> 01:59:37,125
I will admit
you are pretty clever.

1682
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:41,625
But if I took
this hammer here...

1683
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:46,916
and I bashed in
your skull with it...

1684
01:59:46,916 --> 01:59:52,416
you would have the same three
dimples in the same place...

1685
01:59:53,541 --> 01:59:56,125
as Old Ben.

1686
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:59,833
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1687
01:59:59,833 --> 02:00:02,750
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1688
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:05,541
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that
sawed-off.

1689
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:10,583
There have been a lot of lies
said around this dinner table
here tonight,

1690
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:13,166
but that you can believe!

1691
02:00:13,166 --> 02:00:15,875
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1692
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:18,666
hanging off these
boys' hips here?

1693
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:25,750
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1694
02:00:30,166 --> 02:00:31,666
Where were we?

1695
02:00:36,083 --> 02:00:37,583
Jackass.

1696
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,000
Ah, yes.

1697
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1698
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,583
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1699
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:50,208
Am I right?

1700
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,500
Right.

1701
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:59,416
Bring out Hildi!

1702
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,708
Get over there yonder.

1703
02:01:04,708 --> 02:01:07,416
- [screams]
- Sit your ass in
that goddamn...

1704
02:01:07,416 --> 02:01:10,500
- [Stephen] Lay your hand flat
on that tabletop.
- [Calvin] Now shut your mouth!

1705
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:17,333
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1706
02:01:17,333 --> 02:01:20,250
"you yourself said that
for the right nigger"

1707
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:24,833
you'd be willin' to pay
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount.

1708
02:01:24,833 --> 02:01:28,125
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition
of ridiculous?"

1709
02:01:28,125 --> 02:01:32,750
To which you said, "$12,000."

1710
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:36,750
- [yells]
- Now, considering y'all have
ridden a whole lot of miles,

1711
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:40,916
went through a whole lot of
trouble, and done spread a
whole lot of bull

1712
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:43,375
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1713
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:49,583
it would appear that
Broomhilda is, in fact...
the right nigger.

1714
02:01:49,583 --> 02:01:53,666
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1715
02:01:53,666 --> 02:01:59,208
the price is $12,000.

1716
02:01:59,208 --> 02:02:03,375
And I take it you prefer the
"take it or leave it" style
of negotiation?

1717
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:07,750
Yes, I do, doctor.

1718
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:11,000
You see, under the laws
of Chickasaw County,

1719
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,583
Broomhilda here is my property.

1720
02:02:14,583 --> 02:02:19,958
And I can choose to do with my
property whatever I so desire!

1721
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,583
And if y'all think my price...

1722
02:02:23,583 --> 02:02:27,583
- ...for this nigger here
is too steep...
- [grunts]

1723
02:02:27,583 --> 02:02:30,416
what I'm gonna
desire to do is...

1724
02:02:34,208 --> 02:02:37,500
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with
it!

1725
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:39,625
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1726
02:02:39,625 --> 02:02:44,416
Then we can examine the three
dimples inside Broomhilda's
skull!

1727
02:02:44,416 --> 02:02:48,708
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1728
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:50,208
- [Hildi whimpering]
- What's it gonna be?

1729
02:02:50,208 --> 02:02:51,916
May I lift the hands
off the tabletop

1730
02:02:51,916 --> 02:02:54,583
in order to remove
my billfold?

1731
02:02:55,416 --> 02:02:56,833
Yes, you may.

1732
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:11,833
That 12.

1733
02:03:15,625 --> 02:03:17,666
- Sold!
- [screaming]

1734
02:03:17,666 --> 02:03:20,416
To the man with
the exceptional beard

1735
02:03:20,416 --> 02:03:24,041
and his unexceptional nigger.

1736
02:03:29,583 --> 02:03:32,083
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1737
02:03:32,083 --> 02:03:35,958
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1738
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:37,875
$12,000.

1739
02:03:40,875 --> 02:03:43,166
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1740
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:45,750
Now, gentlemen...

1741
02:03:46,875 --> 02:03:49,666
if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1742
02:03:49,666 --> 02:03:52,958
we will be
serving white cake.

1743
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:56,083
[Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
played on harp]

1744
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:52,750
- [screaming]
- [dogs snarling]

1745
02:05:07,916 --> 02:05:09,666
[screaming]

1746
02:05:20,416 --> 02:05:21,958
Well done, Calvin.

1747
02:05:24,166 --> 02:05:27,375
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1748
02:05:28,666 --> 02:05:30,750
Could you please
stop playing Beethoven?

1749
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:32,458
Take your hands off
the harp!

1750
02:05:36,458 --> 02:05:37,791
[Stephen] Doctor!

1751
02:05:37,791 --> 02:05:40,583
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1752
02:05:40,583 --> 02:05:42,000
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1753
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,500
Let it be.

1754
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:45,583
He's just a little upset,
that's all.

1755
02:05:45,583 --> 02:05:47,208
I'll handle this.

1756
02:06:12,791 --> 02:06:14,000
White cake?

1757
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,541
I don't go in for sweets,
thank you.

1758
02:06:18,416 --> 02:06:19,833
Hm.

1759
02:06:24,416 --> 02:06:25,541
[Calvin chuckles softly]

1760
02:06:27,125 --> 02:06:30,750
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1761
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:35,625
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs
today.

1762
02:06:35,625 --> 02:06:38,250
D'Artagnan.

1763
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:42,250
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1764
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:43,833
Come again?

1765
02:06:46,666 --> 02:06:51,083
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The Three Musketeers.

1766
02:06:51,083 --> 02:06:52,750
Yes, of course, doctor.

1767
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:54,458
I figured you
must be an admirer.

1768
02:06:54,458 --> 02:06:59,166
You named your slave after
his novel's lead character.

1769
02:06:59,166 --> 02:07:02,875
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1770
02:07:02,875 --> 02:07:05,166
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1771
02:07:07,083 --> 02:07:09,083
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1772
02:07:11,083 --> 02:07:16,458
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1773
02:07:18,583 --> 02:07:20,458
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1774
02:07:22,208 --> 02:07:24,583
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1775
02:07:28,291 --> 02:07:31,083
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1776
02:07:31,083 --> 02:07:33,000
- May I?
- Of course.

1777
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,583
Thank you.

1778
02:07:36,416 --> 02:07:39,541
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1779
02:07:39,541 --> 02:07:41,916
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1780
02:07:41,916 --> 02:07:44,416
Would you have
ink and pen for me?

1781
02:07:45,416 --> 02:07:47,500
Right over there
on that little table.

1782
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:48,916
Thank you.

1783
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:11,125
Thank you.

1784
02:08:14,541 --> 02:08:16,916
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1785
02:08:18,916 --> 02:08:21,541
consider yourself
a free woman.

1786
02:08:33,375 --> 02:08:35,583
Mr. Candie...

1787
02:08:37,166 --> 02:08:41,166
normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1788
02:08:41,166 --> 02:08:45,791
But since what auf Wiedersehen
actually means is "till I see
you again"

1789
02:08:45,791 --> 02:08:48,166
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1790
02:08:48,166 --> 02:08:53,166
to you, sir...
I say, "goodbye."

1791
02:08:56,958 --> 02:08:58,375
Let's go.

1792
02:08:59,208 --> 02:09:00,875
Come on.

1793
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:04,708
One more moment, doctor!

1794
02:09:06,416 --> 02:09:07,583
What?

1795
02:09:12,208 --> 02:09:14,791
It's a custom here
in the South...

1796
02:09:14,791 --> 02:09:20,291
once a business deal is
concluded that the two parties
shake hands.

1797
02:09:21,041 --> 02:09:23,000
It implies good faith.

1798
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,416
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1799
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:29,500
in my house, doctor.

1800
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,583
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1801
02:09:32,583 --> 02:09:34,583
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1802
02:09:34,583 --> 02:09:38,250
Oh, then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite
direction.

1803
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:42,041
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1804
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,916
No, I don't.

1805
02:09:45,416 --> 02:09:50,833
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal
winner.

1806
02:09:50,833 --> 02:09:55,916
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1807
02:09:55,916 --> 02:09:58,625
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1808
02:09:58,625 --> 02:10:02,416
Even after all that paper
signin', don't mean shit...

1809
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:07,625
you don't shake my hand.

1810
02:10:07,625 --> 02:10:13,583
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1811
02:10:13,583 --> 02:10:15,458
I don't think so.

1812
02:10:16,250 --> 02:10:17,666
Mr. Pooch?

1813
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:24,166
If she tries to leave here
before this nigger-loving German
shakes my hand,

1814
02:10:24,166 --> 02:10:26,083
you cut her ass down.

1815
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:29,958
[cocking shotgun]

1816
02:10:47,791 --> 02:10:51,416
You really want me
to shake your hand?

1817
02:10:52,916 --> 02:10:54,708
I insist.

1818
02:10:55,583 --> 02:10:58,416
If you insist.

1819
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:02,000
[metal springing noise]

1820
02:11:14,791 --> 02:11:18,041
No! Calvin!

1821
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:20,750
Calvin!

1822
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:23,250
[slow heartbeat rhythm]

1823
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:29,541
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1824
02:11:32,125 --> 02:11:34,125
[sobbing]

1825
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:43,916
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1826
02:11:43,916 --> 02:11:45,833
- [screaming]
- Help, he's killing everyone!

1827
02:11:45,833 --> 02:11:47,750
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

1828
02:11:51,666 --> 02:11:52,875
Ah! [Screams]

1829
02:11:52,875 --> 02:11:54,250
[grunting]

1830
02:11:57,583 --> 02:11:59,250
[screaming]

1831
02:12:02,875 --> 02:12:04,166

fortune,

1998
02:23:44,875 --> 02:23:47,666
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1999
02:23:47,666 --> 02:23:50,500
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

2000
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:54,916
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't
illegal.

2001
02:23:54,916 --> 02:23:56,500
You can't steal it.

2002
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:59,083
You got to earn it, white boy.

2003
02:23:59,083 --> 02:24:01,291
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

2004
02:24:01,291 --> 02:24:04,708
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

2005
02:24:04,708 --> 02:24:07,000
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

2006
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,500
on Smitty Bacall
and the Bacall Gang.

2007
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:11,083
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

2008
02:24:11,083 --> 02:24:14,708
Smitty Bacall is the leader
of this murderous gang
of stagecoach robbers,

2009
02:24:14,708 --> 02:24:16,291
the Bacall Gang.

2010
02:24:16,291 --> 02:24:19,791
There's a $7,000 "Wanted Dead
or Alive" bounty on him,

2011
02:24:19,791 --> 02:24:23,291
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

2012
02:24:23,291 --> 02:24:26,708
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

2013
02:24:26,708 --> 02:24:29,583
and Crazy Craig Koons.

2014
02:24:29,583 --> 02:24:31,125
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

2015
02:24:31,125 --> 02:24:33,500
they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

2016
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:37,333
You know why? 'Cause they
just got away with murder.

2017
02:24:37,333 --> 02:24:39,041
But it ain't got to be that way.

2018
02:24:39,041 --> 02:24:40,958
You and your mates,
y'all can ride back there

2019
02:24:40,958 --> 02:24:42,416
and y'all can
go get that money.

2020
02:24:42,416 --> 02:24:43,750
What'd these jokers do again?

2021
02:24:43,750 --> 02:24:47,125
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

2022
02:24:47,125 --> 02:24:51,750
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

2023
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:54,916
I got the handbill right here in
my pocket, if you let me get it.

2024
02:24:54,916 --> 02:24:56,250
Get it out.

2025

Smitty Bacall and the Smitty
Bacall Gang."

2029

2030
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:10,458
- [man 1]
"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

2031
02:25:10,458 --> 02:25:13,583
- [man 2] That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

2032
02:25:14,750 --> 02:25:17,583
Yesterday, as a free man,

2033
02:25:17,583 --> 02:25:22,166
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

2034
02:25:22,166 --> 02:25:23,958
Dr. King Schultz.

2035
02:25:23,958 --> 02:25:28,666
We tracked the Bacall Gang all
the way from Texas to Chickasaw
County.

2036
02:25:28,666 --> 02:25:31,958
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

2037
02:25:31,958 --> 02:25:35,583
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

2038
02:25:35,583 --> 02:25:38,958
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

2039
02:25:38,958 --> 02:25:43,500
then everybody there decided
to blame me, so here I am.

2040
02:25:45,291 --> 02:25:47,416
But y'all know I ain't
on that manifest.

2041
02:25:47,416 --> 02:25:50,416
And all y'all know I ain't
supposed to be on this trip.

2042
02:25:50,416 --> 02:25:53,916
But them four men is still back
there, they're still wanted,

2043
02:25:53,916 --> 02:25:57,250
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

2044
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:59,791
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

2045
02:25:59,791 --> 02:26:01,708
[man 1] What's the deal?

2046
02:26:01,708 --> 02:26:05,208
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

2047
02:26:05,208 --> 02:26:08,208
No, no, no, no. I ain't gonna
tell you who they are.

2048
02:26:08,208 --> 02:26:12,000
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

2049
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,750
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

2050
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:18,750
This is a real handbill.

2051
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:19,916
Now just 'cause
it's a real handbill

2052
02:26:19,916 --> 02:26:22,083
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

2053
02:26:22,083 --> 02:26:28,250
Now why would a slave have a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill
in his pocket?

2054
02:26:32,625 --> 02:26:35,750
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

2055
02:26:41,916 --> 02:26:46,041
All right,
I'm gonna ask you again.

2056
02:26:47,083 --> 02:26:50,458
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

2057
02:26:50,458 --> 02:26:52,375
Is he a Candyland slave,

2058
02:26:52,375 --> 02:26:56,250
or did he ride in with a white
man on a horse yesterday?

2059
02:26:56,250 --> 02:27:00,083
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

2060
02:27:00,083 --> 02:27:02,875
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

2061
02:27:02,875 --> 02:27:07,750
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

2062
