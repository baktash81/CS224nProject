00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:53,901
Warrior (2011)

2
00:00:53,902 --> 00:01:00,908
sub.resync. for FTW's release,
by npdv

3
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Hey, Jenny.
That was a wonderful share, tonight.

4
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,548
"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,300
"Enter Ahab. Then, all.

6
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,804
"It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe..."

7
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,557
"...that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his wont..."

8
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,355
"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck."

9
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,125
"'It's a white whale, I say 'resumed Ahab,
as he threw down the top-maul."

10
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,208
"A white whale-
Skin your eyes for him, men,"

11
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,841
"look sharp for white water;
if ye see but a bubble, sing out."

12
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,622
Tommy?

13
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,996
Jesus!

14
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,384
What are you doing here?

15
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,795
Well, I was just passing through

16
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,724
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

17
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,551
Yeah.

18
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,393
She looks good.

19
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,359
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

20
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,405
Well, you always did take good care of her.

21
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
Paddy Conlon.

22
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,074
Man of priorities.

23
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,588
I got a little something for you.

24
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,755
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

25
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,086
She did.

26
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,926
That's not for me anymore, Tommy.

27
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,637
What? You changed brands?

28
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,021
Let's go inside, huh?

29
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,611
Tommy!

30
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,273
Come on, let's go inside.

31
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,131
I like what you've done with the place.

32
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,683
Yeah, I appreciate that.

33
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,805
There's not much of a woman's touch
around here.

34
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,641
Yeah, well...

35
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,402
And no more women for me, Tommy.

36
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,113
Yeah.

37
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,410
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

38
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,576
Here you go.

39
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,254
Coffee?

40
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,168
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

41
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,379
-Come on.
-I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

42
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,339
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

43
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,350
-Come on, it's just a drink.
-No.

44
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,968
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

45
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,221
Remember Tess?

46
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,015
They had two beautiful little girls.

47
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,499
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

48
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,341
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

49
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,806
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

50
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,592
Who knew?

51
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,684
So, you gonna ask about her,

52
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,445
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

53
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,653
-I know.
-You know? What do you know? Huh?

54
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,609
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

55
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,366
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

56
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

57
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:53,849
And is that one of the 12 steps?

58
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,162
Or does a guy like you get 24?

59
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,879
Just 12.

60
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,312
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

61
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,025
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

62
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,316
But you were in the Marines.

63
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,114
That was all.

64
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,911
That was enough.

65
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,285
Well, that's too bad,

66
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,541
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

67
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,206
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

68
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,171
in a shit box with no heat.

69
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,884
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

70
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,639
All the time waiting for your pal,
Jesus, to save her.

71
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,442
Did your man tell you that?

72
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm sorry, Tommy.

73
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,374
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

74
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,496
It goes a long way.

75
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,971
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

76
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,146
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

77
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,856
You say I can, but you say I can't.

78
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,159
-What about if we all get a unicorn?
-No.

79
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,781
-Don't you want a unicorn?
-No.

80
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,412
What's going on up here?

81
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,164
-Oh, my goodness.
-Well, I'm not sure,

82
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,873
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

83
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,754
-Daddy, you look so handsome.
-Do I?

84
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,585
-He's a very pretty princess.
-We're painting Daddy's face.

85
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,754
Yeah, you are.

86
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,768
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

87
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,015
-Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
-Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

88
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,691
-All right! It's time for presents!
-I have to put this down.

89
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,735
-Here. You wanna put it down?
-Presents time!

90
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,733
-Everybody, come bring your presents!
-What is it? What is it?

91
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,613
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

92
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,948
-All right.
-Happy birthday, Emily.

93
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,655
-What did you get? What did you get?
-Babe?

94
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,449
It's an awfully big box.

95
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,326
It's her birthday. Come on.

96
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,161
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

97
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,838
You set it and you don't budge.

98
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,837
-This one's mine.
-Hey, open the big box!

99
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,376
It's okay.

100
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,006
-I love you. Be good, okay?
-Bye, Mommy.

101
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,343
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

102
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,846
-Hey, babe. I'm late.
-Hey.

103
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,352
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

104
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,810
-They've been fed, they just need a bath.
-I'm on it.

105
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,233
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

106
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,564
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

107
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,945
Where's the rest of that skirt?

108
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,360
Babe.

109
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,736
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

110
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,197
you give me a call, okay?

111
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,156
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

112
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,992
decided to smash up your face.

113
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,248
I told you, most nights,
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

114
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,422
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

115
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,428
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

116
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,171
Promises, promises.

117
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,724
And we return here on MMA Live,

118
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,149
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

119
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,272
the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

120
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,270
Now, J.J., what led to this project

121
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,822
That is really redefining
mixed martial arts here in the States?

122
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,363
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

123
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,116
and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,

124
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,995
I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,
so I tracked these guys down.

125
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,244
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

126
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,873
the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

127
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,040
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

128
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,090
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J.J. Riley,

129
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,718
going from the lions' den of Wall Street
to the cage,

130
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,472
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta...

131
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,598
Doing good. One more time.

132
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,725
Fitzy still own this?

133
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,058
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

134
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,811
Can I help you with something?

135
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,402
How does it work?

136
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,400
Thirty-five a month with locker.

137
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,653
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11:00.

138
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,164
So you want to join?

139
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,741
Sure.

140
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,538
Put your name and contact info on the card.

141
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,673
Thank you.

142
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,684
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

143
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,021
Hold on, Tito.

144
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,314
So, we have a body at rest,

145
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,893
and you have the bat which needs...

146
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,853
-Acceleration.
-Acceleration, okay.

147
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,273
If you have enough acceleration,

148
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,949
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

149
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,654
-Okay. All right. You ready?
-Piece of cake.

150
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,328
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

151
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,867
Come on, man!

152
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,707
Come on, son!

153
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,623
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

154
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,633
Remind me not to mess with you.

155
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,675
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

156
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,048
So, have we got it?

157
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,764
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

158
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,310
All right. Has everybody else got it?

159
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,476
-Yeah.
-Yes? Okay, good. All right.

160
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,306
The third law...

161
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,483
How many laws this dude got?

162
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,398
-The dude?
-Yes, the dude.

163
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,354
The dude has three, all right?

164
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,321
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

165
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,324
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

166
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,748
For example,

167
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,999
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

168
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,788
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

169
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,626
then my reaction might be
to send her down to Principal Zito's office.

170
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,009
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

171
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,346
Mr. C, I put it away.

172
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,850
All right, before you go,
I have your tests from last week.

173
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
Just work it out.

174
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
Stop downing.

175
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,731
Pick up the hands.

176
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,527
Tighten it up!

177
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,576
Use your right.

178
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,195
Seal his hands, come on.

179
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,952
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

180
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,996
Go light!

181
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,045
I said, go light!

182
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,126
God damn it!

183
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,170
Where do you find these girls?

184
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,175
We got a tournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

185
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,264
Oh, jeez.

186
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,353
Fenroy, get me some ice.

187
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,140
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

188
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,147
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

189
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,853
Yo, I'll fight him.

190
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

191
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,899
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

192
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,405
Let's go. Watch his neck.

193
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,699
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

194
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,497
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

195
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
His phone's disconnected.

196
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,756
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

197
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,301
All I'm saying is
that if you need somebody to help you,

198
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,093
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

199
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,685
You ever fought before?

200
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,769
Yeah.

201
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,608
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

202
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,739
All good.

203
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,074
-What's your name?
-Tommy.

204
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,753
-You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
-Sure, no problem. No problem.

205
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,290
Come on in.

206
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,262
Let's go. All right, let's go.

207
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,306
Hey. Watch that teeth.

208
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,514
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

209
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,813
Come on. Check that kick.

210
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,272
Easy.

211
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,987
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

212
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,828
-Good jab. Good jab!
-There we go!

213
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,163
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

214
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,247
-Dog, get up.
-Get up!

215
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,258
Cover up, cover up!

216
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,841
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

217
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,182
-Cover up!
-Come on, Dog!

218
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,136
Cover up, damn it!

219
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,743
You owe me 200 bucks.

220
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,097
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

221
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,268
-that came in.
-Yeah.

222
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,517
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

223
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,475
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

224
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,809
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

225
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,519
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

226
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,775
It's the county that did the assessment,
not the bank.

227
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,232
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

228
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,409
-Brendan.
-The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

229
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,494
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

230
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,288
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

231
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,909
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

232
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,666
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

233
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,418
-you understand?
-God, you said that like three times.

234
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm sorry, but I get that.

235
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,841
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

236
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,431
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

237
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,008
You refinanced twice already.

238
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,764
'Cause you advised us to do that.

239
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,228
-You told me.
-Well, I presented you with that option,

240
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,600
but that was your choice.

241
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,481
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

242
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
We had that conversation.

243
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,316
I was paying medical bills.

244
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,369
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

245
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,285
-Heart.
-Heart. Right, sorry.

246
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,746
A lot of stories.

247
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,871
All right, so, if that's my option,
I have no options.

248
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,207
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

249
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,089
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
I can get you 90 days to get even.

250
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,215
Ninety days is not enough.

251
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,969
My wife and I,
we have three jobs between us.

252
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,677
And that doesn't cut it.

253
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,313
So, what do you suggest?

254
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,976
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

255
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,152
It's a viable option.

256
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,152
There's no shame in this these days.

257
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,616
That's not how I do things.

258
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,834
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

259
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,676
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

260
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,305
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.

261
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,602
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of Eve.

262
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,521
-Talking about Paddy Conlon?
-The controversial Paddy Conlon.

263
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,229
Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,

264
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,027
but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles

265
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,855
and now just moments away
from a High School State Championship.

266
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,111
And there it is! Wow!

267
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,118
There 's just no limit
to what the future holds for this kid.

268
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,788
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

269
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,618
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

270
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,793
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

271
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,504
-Who?
-Tommy Riordan.

272
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,465
My name is Colt Boyd.

273
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,388
What business you got with Tommy?

274
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,593
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

275
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,601
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

276
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,563
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

277
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,987
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

278
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,988
Maybe help him out.

279
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,535
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

280
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,118
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

281
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,830
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

282
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,627
you gotta ask him yourself.

283
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

284
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,299
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

285
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,921
you gotta ask him yourself.

286
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,677
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

287
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,096
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

288
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,094
He doesn't live here.

289
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,428
-All right, then.
-Okay. Good night.

290
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:53,023
***repeated scene***

291
00:20:57,028 --> 00:21:00,999
All right, listen, kiddo.
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

292
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,208
I love you.

293
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:06,371
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

294
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:13,003
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

295
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,552
All right, sleep well.

296
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,099
You, too. All right, bye.

297
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:26,224
It's about time for your next contest.

298
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:31,654
Introducing first, in the red corner;
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

299
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:36,530
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

300
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:37,693
Say, "Uncle!"

301
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,286
Go, Mike. Go!

302
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:48,459
And his opponent in the blue corner;
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

303
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:52,922
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

304
00:21:57,046 --> 00:22:00,516
This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,

305
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:04,479
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr Rick Fike.

306
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,102
Fighters to the center

307
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:10,859
Come on, gentlemen.

308
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:13,029
I want you to obey my commands
at all times.

309
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,232
I want you to protect yourselves at all times.

310
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,658
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

311
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:20,236
And on my signal, let's come out fighting

312
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,203
Fighter, are you ready?

313
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:29,624
Are you ready?

314
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:30,879
Do it!

315
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,303
Come on, Mike, let's go!

316
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,941
You gotta move with that one.

317
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,164
Come on, Mike!

318
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,677
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

319
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:31,390
Get up, Mike, get up!

320
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:51,161
-First five minutes, out.
-Another 15? Great.

321
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,206
Hey! Hey, kid!

322
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:58,877
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

323
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,260
Hey, good job...

324
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,152
Hey, babe.

325
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:17,485
Hey.

326
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:48,430
How was work?

327
00:24:52,972 --> 00:24:54,519
Oh, my God!

328
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:59,270
What happened?

329
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,398
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

330
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,328
I'm not bouncing at a club.

331
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:12,458
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

332
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,641
You've been lying to me?

333
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:38,480
I went in to apply

334
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:44,815
and they were paying nine bucks an hour.

335
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:53,245
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

336
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:02,257
They're putting us out of the house
in three months.

337
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,425
We're running out of options.

338
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,173
Then they put us out of the house
in three months.

339
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:07,008
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

340
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:10,182
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

341
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:13,348
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

342
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:17,022
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

343
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,525
We're not giving up the house.

344
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,439
It's our home.

345
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,408
We're not going backwards.

346
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,249
We'll figure it Out.

347
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,337
This is what we're not going back to.

348
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:48,105
You wanted to talk?

349
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:50,990
Yeah.

350
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:55,529
I'm gonna start fighting.

351
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:57,410
Is that right?

352
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:58,536
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

353
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,959
I know that guy from the gym
came to see you.

354
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,537
Colt Boyd.

355
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,752
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

356
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:09,252
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

357
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,632
-Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
-No. Thank you. I'm fine.

358
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:14,719
-Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
-Sure. Thank you.

359
00:28:17,092 --> 00:28:18,844
All right.

360
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:21,021
There's this tournament,

361
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,682
it's a big tournament.

362
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:27,065
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

363
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,943
Winner takes all. It's a lot of money.

364
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,408
-Okay.
-I'm gonna do that.

365
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:37,370
But if I'm doing it,

366
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:43,502
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

367
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:46,331
Now, that much, you were good at.

368
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:49,879
What?

369
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:53,012
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

370
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:55,180
I'm serious.

371
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:57,307
We train. That's it.

372
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,931
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

373
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,557
You understand?

374
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:05,562
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

375
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:09,027
Or you can take it to a meeting, or to church,

376
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:11,526
or whatever the hell it is
that you do nowadays.

377
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:13,323
What about Colt Boyd?

378
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,901
What about him? I told him
I don't train with people that I don't know.

379
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,407
-The devil you know.
-Excuse me?

380
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:22,537
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don’t.

381
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,208
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

382
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:29,502
There's your coffee, hon.

383
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,424
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

384
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:36,055
Chasing Theogenes
It'll be kind of like the old times.

385
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:39,800
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

386
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:43,687
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

387
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,605
All right. All right.

388
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:48,312
But you get something
through your skull, too.

389
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:52,568
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

390
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:56,742
And since this is about training,

391
00:29:57,067 --> 00:30:00,697
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

392
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,702
I don't wanna see them.

393
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:05,917
In fact, hand them over right now.

394
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:09,830
I know they're on you, Tommy.

395
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,668
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

396
00:30:25,596 --> 00:30:27,348
That's not gonna do.

397
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:33,108
When you came through that door, it was...

398
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:37,070
Three.

399
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:45,158
That'a boy.

400
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:49,541
And another thing.
You don't eat crap like this.

401
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,793
This is for losers and old men.

402
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,543
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

403
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:57,879
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

404
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:01,633
I watch your diet.
We follow the old regimen.

405
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,510
You copy?

406
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:08,138
All right.

407
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,983
COPY-

408
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,323
Your brother's a liar.

409
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:27,908
-...went in the middle of the night...
-Yeah.

410
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:30,494
...and he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

411
00:31:30,577 --> 00:31:31,794
-No way.
-Front and center.

412
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,168
-Like MMA type stuff.
-You weren't there, so you don't know.

413
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:35,249
What’s MMA?

414
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:36,299
-Mixed martial arts.
-Like, fighting.

415
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,752
Like, different styles of fighting.

416
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,178
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

417
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,556
It's true?

418
00:31:46,635 --> 00:31:48,558
Take your seats.

419
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:49,980
Now, please.

420
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,243
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

421
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:05,737
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar
last night,

422
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:09,371
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

423
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,535
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

424
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:13,461
Did you really work on some fools
or something?

425
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:15,460
-You have to tell us.
-Yeah.

426
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,804
All right.
I want examples of forms of energy.

427
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:51,996
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

428
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:57,172
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

429
00:32:57,247 --> 00:33:00,717
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

430
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:03,007
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

431
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:06,965
Oh, man.

432
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:10,265
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

433
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,765
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

434
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:21,105
I need the money, Joe.

435
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:23,865
Yeah, but this is...

436
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:25,655
We can't have this.

437
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:29,079
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

438
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:32,040
Shit, Brendan.

439
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:35,039
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

440
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:36,961
are you out of your mind?

441
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,214
You're gonna get yourself killed.

442
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:40,882
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

443
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:43,460
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

444
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:48,053
Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

445
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:53,095
I fought for a living.

446
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:57,687
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

447
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:01,482
Yeah, I guess you did.

448
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:03,947
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

449
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:06,866
Look, look,
the school district is not gonna tolerate

450
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:09,036
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

451
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:11,746
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

452
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:14,200
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

453
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:19,213
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

454
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,665
This is a serious problem.

455
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:29,223
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

456
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:33,844
What are we gonna do?

457
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:37,935
You say, "Yes, sir," and you say, "No, sir,"

458
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:40,984
and you say,
"It will never happen again, sir."

459
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:45,406
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

460
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:52,742
UFC?

461
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:56,533
Yeah.

462
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,248
Son of a bitch.

463
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,882
-Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
-Principal Zito.

464
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:23,985
What are you doing?

465
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:27,944
Well,

466
00:35:28,023 --> 00:35:31,402
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

467
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:35,288
And we have an equipment malfunction.

468
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:41,044
How'd it go?

469
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,000
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

470
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:50,588
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

471
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:59,930
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

472
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,642
How the hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

473
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:06,899
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

474
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:09,197
That's nice.

475
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,945
He said there's no precedent for this.

476
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,194
You'll be back by next semester.

477
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,279
The next semester?

478
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,045
Tess,

479
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:32,300
they have these smoker fights all over.

480
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:38,268
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

481
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:41,472
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

482
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,319
That could keep us afloat.

483
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:53,613
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

484
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,864
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

485
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:05,754
I would have to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

486
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:08,673
Yeah.

487
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,800
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

488
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,430
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

489
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:27,977
Now, if you have a better solution,

490
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:30,357
I'm all ears, but...

491
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:35,818
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

492
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:38,954
It'll be fine.

493
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:41,623
I'll just leave the house as usual,

494
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:44,747
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

495
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,384
The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack

496
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:05,272
And the cow goes
moo, moo, moo!

497
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:10,519
But that rooster
That rooster; he knew everything

498
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:16,154
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

499
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:19,031
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

500
00:38:20,904 --> 00:38:22,577
Look what I found

501
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:25,284
in that disaster of a...

502
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:28,665
...basement

503
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:33,125
What do you say we sit down

504
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,344
and update this?

505
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:41,884
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

506
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:49,729
Did you continue wrestling
after you left with your mother?

507
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:56,527
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

508
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,614
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

509
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:05,324
You can take that back
to where you found it,

510
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:07,876
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

511
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:10,750
I can pour that myself.

512
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:13,298
And I can wake myself up, too.

513
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,349
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

514
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:28,897
Yeah?

515
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:33,523
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

516
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:43,616
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

517
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:47,411
You can square your gear away.

518
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,209
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them know we're back.

519
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:51,707
Roger, sir.

520
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,915
Detail, a-ten-hut!

521
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:57,880
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

522
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:02,097
What's up, Mark?

523
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,766
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

524
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,889
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

525
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:08,641
-Did you see that? Oh, my God.
-What?

526
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,812
What's that?

527
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:13,609
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

528
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:15,151
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

529
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:17,695
Shit, Bradford,
the stuff you don't know amazes me.

530
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:20,524
-Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
-Wow. Oh, my God.

531
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,985
-Wait. Rewind that.
-Okay.

532
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:27,993
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

533
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,581
What's up, man?

534
00:40:35,538 --> 00:40:36,790
Dude, what's his deal?

535
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,714
You're not gonna get your 11.

536
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,891
-AV, I need to see the tape.
-What tape?

537
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,893
-what tape?
-The tape!

538
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:54,224
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

539
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:55,642
Get the camera.

540
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:32,849
That's him.

541
00:41:35,265 --> 00:41:37,108
That's him.

542
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,981
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

543
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:45,567
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

544
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,654
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

545
00:41:53,074 --> 00:41:56,374
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

546
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:02,625
Good.

547
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,132
Good, good, good. Yos.

548
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:09,883
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

549
00:42:15,972 --> 00:42:17,269
Do I know you?

550
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:20,981
-Oh, man!
-Wow.

551
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,904
-Long time, brother. Too long.
-How you doing?

552
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,277
-Too long.
-Look at your place.

553
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:26,357
-You like?
-Yeah.

554
00:42:26,941 --> 00:42:30,286
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

555
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,238
-He's training for Sparta.
-Yeah, right.

556
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:33,699
Not bad, right?

557
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:35,499
It's amazing, man.

558
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:39,375
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

559
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:43,170
-You look good, brother.
-Thanks.

560
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,593
How are the girls?

561
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:52,516
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

562
00:42:52,592 --> 00:42:56,597
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

563
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,976
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

564
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,142
You know,

565
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,110
I was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

566
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:08,032
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you.
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:09,108
-No. Come on.
-No.

568
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:12,779
Brendan, I'm sorry.

569
00:43:13,488 --> 00:43:15,741
It's all good. She's good now.

570
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:17,791
-She's okay?
-So beautiful.

571
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:26,635
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

572
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,131
Yeah.

573
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:32,591
Well, I've got a little problem.

574
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:37,637
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

575
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,472
-What?
-Yeah.

576
00:43:40,223 --> 00:43:43,067
That's kind of why
I came to see you, actually.

577
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:50,908
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

578
00:43:50,984 --> 00:43:52,156
but how much do you need?

579
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,074
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

580
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:56,914
I mean, I was hoping that

581
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:01,377
you would train me.

582
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:03,162
Train you for what?

583
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:05,582
I wanna get back in the cage.

584
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:07,917
Are you serious?

585
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:12,676
Come on, Brendan.

586
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,591
I won an event the other night.

587
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:18,724
You won an event. That's what this is.

588
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:22,478
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

589
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:26,061
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

590
00:44:27,937 --> 00:44:29,655
-Ish.
-Ish.

591
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,113
Brendan. I love you.

592
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,612
Why am I gonna train you?

593
00:44:36,863 --> 00:44:39,286
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a .500 fighter.

594
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:42,369
You never listened to me.

595
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:45,831
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

596
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:51,010
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

597
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:54,635
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days a week after detention?

598
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:58,309
You're gonna skip out
of the girls' volleyball game early?

599
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,309
I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue.

600
00:45:02,263 --> 00:45:05,563
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

601
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:15,117
I need to keep working the smokers.

602
00:45:18,946 --> 00:45:20,573
Tess know about this?

603
00:45:20,656 --> 00:45:22,078
Yeah?

604
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:24,377
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

605
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,331
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

606
00:45:27,413 --> 00:45:29,541
I was unconscious.

607
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:33,549
-You were more than unconscious.
-I was.

608
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:37,974
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

609
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:41,724
It's not gonna happen.

610
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:42,850
What do you say, Frank?

611
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:46,724
What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

612
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,898
I mean, all my time
is wrapped up with Marco.

613
00:45:49,977 --> 00:45:53,026
You know, you come down, I throw you
in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

614
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:57,703
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

615
00:45:57,777 --> 00:45:59,154
That's all I need.

616
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:01,489
Great. All right.

617
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:03,040
Yeah.

618
00:46:03,116 --> 00:46:05,164
-I appreciate it.
-What, are you kidding me?

619
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:07,537
-You need anything, you call me.
-I will.

620
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,963
Let me know when you're coming down.

621
00:46:09,038 --> 00:46:11,587
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

622
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,001
Now?

623
00:46:40,403 --> 00:46:42,155
Hey, Brendan.

624
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:45,537
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

625
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:52,373
What are you doing here?

626
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:54,591
I have some news for you.

627
00:46:58,087 --> 00:47:00,510
Something wrong with your hands?

628
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,933
-No.
-If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

629
00:47:02,008 --> 00:47:03,385
there's no reason for you not to phone.

630
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:06,016
-That's the deal.
-Yeah. I forgot.

631
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:08,143
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

632
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:12,272
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

633
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:13,944
Ever seen that?

634
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:17,698
I'm going inside.

635
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:20,117
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

636
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,612
Thousand days sober, today.

637
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:26,370
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

638
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:27,575
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

639
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:29,744
Have a heart, Brendan.

640
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:32,209
You listen to me.

641
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:35,337
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

642
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:38,507
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

643
00:47:38,586 --> 00:47:42,932
All right, listen to me.
I thought maybe we could break bread.

644
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:46,227
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

645
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:51,563
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

646
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,063
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

647
00:47:53,142 --> 00:47:54,314
it doesn't make it one for me.

648
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,395
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

649
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:58,152
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

650
00:47:58,231 --> 00:48:02,031
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

651
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:03,907
I haven't seen in three years.

652
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:05,738
And another one I haven't even ever met.

653
00:48:05,905 --> 00:48:08,829
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

654
00:48:08,908 --> 00:48:10,831
Why is that?

655
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:14,960
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

656
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,962
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

657
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,344
That shit you pulled.

658
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:23,757
Never again.

659
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:26,308
And all that shit I saw growing up,

660
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:29,933
-that doesn't happen here.
-Look...

661
00:48:32,181 --> 00:48:33,353
Take care of yourself.

662
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:37,645
Tommy's back.

663
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,953
He's in the 'Burgh.

664
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:51,621
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

665
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,999
Yeah, he came to see me.

666
00:48:56,122 --> 00:48:57,465
He came to see you?

667
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:01,211
Yeah. He's over at the house.

668
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:06,265
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

669
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:08,055
You remember Fitzy's?

670
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:10,011
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

671
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,057
You and Tommy are training together?

672
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:15,808
Yeah.

673
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:18,819
-Tommy Conlon?
-Riordan.

674
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:21,905
-He's using your mother's maiden name.
-Yeah, I know what her name is.

675
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:26,703
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

676
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:28,829
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

677
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:32,158
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

678
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:34,039
That, too.

679
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:38,581
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

680
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:42,001
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

681
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,094
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

682
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:54,355
-Wow. Look at you.
-What?

683
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,602
Mr. Inside Man.

684
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:57,520
Inside? What?

685
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:01,654
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

686
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:03,447
-Look...
-Now I know what you're really doing here.

687
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:04,944
-What's that?
-You came to gloat.

688
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:07,777
I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

689
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,033
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

690
00:50:10,112 --> 00:50:13,116
-No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
-You got your son back.

691
00:50:18,245 --> 00:50:19,963
You know...

692
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:23,755
Forget it.

693
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:29,966
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

694
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:32,143
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

695
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:38,107
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

696
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:41,610
-You thought Tommy was the one.
-Brendan, I was a drunk.

697
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:44,734
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

698
00:50:44,814 --> 00:50:45,815
Forget it.

699
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:51,454
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

700
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,833
-But I was your son.
-You are my son, Brendan.

701
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:59,082
-Am I?
-Yeah, you are.

702
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:04,088
I'm just asking you if you can find...

703
00:51:06,001 --> 00:51:11,258
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

704
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:17,598
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

705
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:21,647
-Okay.
-But I do not trust you.

706
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:27,357
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

707
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:30,698
-Okay. But they're not different things.
-All right?

708
00:51:30,776 --> 00:51:32,699
You gotta trust to forgive.

709
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,780
Night, Pop.

710
00:51:34,864 --> 00:51:35,990
My God.

711
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:40,078
Is that Emily? Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

712
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:42,959
-Is that Rosie?
-Daddy, who is that?

713
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:45,382
It's just a nice, old man. Come on. Let's go.

714
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,381
How about a cup of coffee?

715
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:06,270
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

716
00:52:06,353 --> 00:52:10,449
that Koba is coming to America
and will fight at Sparta-

717
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:13,236
Universally considered
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

718
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:16,368
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

719
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:18,700
on US soil in his legendary career

720
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:22,003
Slow to half guard.
Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

721
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:27,299
Now start on the other side.
And slip back in, there you go.

722
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:29,718
Tommy,

723
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:32,171
I got some news for you.

724
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:33,301
I got you into Sparta.

725
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:35,219
It took some doing,

726
00:52:35,758 --> 00:52:37,351
but I made it happen.

727
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:44,392
You know thank you and 10% is customary?

728
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:04,666
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

729
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:06,956
Tommy?

730
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,839
Okay. Sorry.

731
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:19,302
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

732
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:23,564
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

733
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:26,062
I was getting really worried about you.

734
00:53:27,142 --> 00:53:30,487
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

735
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:31,815
Yeah, they're good.

736
00:53:32,314 --> 00:53:34,863
-Maria 's getting so big.
-Yeah?

737
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,658
She looks more and more like Manny
every day.

738
00:53:39,738 --> 00:53:44,164
-How's little man?
-He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

739
00:53:44,243 --> 00:53:48,043
He's a real good boy.
He takes care of his sister.

740
00:53:48,122 --> 00:53:50,420
-He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
-Good.

741
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:52,342
-We're good.
-Good.

742
00:53:54,587 --> 00:53:56,009
You know...

743
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,056
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

744
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:04,264
what I promised you.

745
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:09,731
What I promised Manny.
I got opportunities coming up, so...

746
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,278
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

747
00:54:11,353 --> 00:54:13,947
Help you guys out.
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

748
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:17,402
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

749
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,033
-I wanna help you.
-You know what? You worry too much.

750
00:54:20,112 --> 00:54:23,286
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

751
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:25,663
You know what? We're hanging in there.

752
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:29,623
”Captain Pollard once more sailed
for the Pacific in command of another ship,

753
00:54:29,705 --> 00:54:33,926
”but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers.

754
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:37,255
”For the second time,
his ship was utterly lost,

755
00:54:37,338 --> 00:54:40,683
”and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since. ”

756
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,645
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

757
00:54:46,013 --> 00:54:48,812
Could you do another thing?
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

758
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:52,441
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

759
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:54,567
And two, and three.

760
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,277
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

761
00:54:56,357 --> 00:54:58,155
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

762
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:01,157
take time out from their international
press tour to join us.

763
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:03,910
J. J., we've never seen
this kind of Grand Prix tournament

764
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:06,993
in this country before.
Tell us, why the unique format?

765
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:11,004
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as anyone
that in mixed martial arts,

766
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,299
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

767
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:15,126
But with this type of format,

768
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,844
it's gonna be tough
to deny who the champion is.

769
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,892
You got four fights in two nights,
16 fighters down to one,

770
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:24,684
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

771
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,728
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

772
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,399
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

773
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:33,189
You gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

774
00:55:33,268 --> 00:55:37,023
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

775
00:55:37,189 --> 00:55:39,692
You see? You feel it? Feel the music.

776
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,823
-Come on!
-Nice.

777
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:44,822
Come on, baby!

778
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:48,409
...with Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

779
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:52,497
as the hype continues for the war
on the shore this Fourth of July weekend

780
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,502
in Atlantic City. You know what that means.

781
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:57,334
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

782
00:55:57,418 --> 00:55:59,216
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

783
00:55:59,294 --> 00:56:02,264
What are they thinking,
entering a winner-take-all tournament

784
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:03,966
against a guy
that seemingly can't be beaten?

785
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:06,761
They're thinking $5 million
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

786
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:09,393
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

787
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,849
Mission impossible, game over; go home.

788
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:13,605
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

789
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:16,358
You can be sure
this will dominate the sports landscape

790
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:18,314
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

791
00:56:18,397 --> 00:56:22,447
The great Koba making his presence felt
in the United States.

792
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:23,994
Two... Come on, Tommy.

793
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:26,288
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

794
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,203
Get on your arm,
watch what's gonna happen.

795
00:56:29,074 --> 00:56:31,452
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

796
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:34,038
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

797
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:41,087
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one of the most watched videos

798
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,888
on YouTube this year

799
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:46,308
Now joining us, via satellite,
is the victim of the infamous incident,

800
00:56:46,383 --> 00:56:47,475
Mad Dog Grimes.

801
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:51,431
Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

802
00:56:51,513 --> 00:56:52,605
and Tommy Riordan?

803
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:55,230
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

804
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:57,812
It is what it is,
and he's gonna pay for it next month

805
00:56:57,895 --> 00:57:00,318
in Atlantic City.

806
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:02,658
Good. Always move. Always move.

807
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:06,158
I don't know, Marco. You're getting
a good game here from a physics teacher.

808
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,367
Good! Good.

809
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:11,208
You see? You see? Beautiful.

810
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:14,537
Top of the food chain.
He's the next champ, right here.

811
00:57:22,294 --> 00:57:24,717
So, with Sparta now
just two short weeks away,

812
00:57:24,797 --> 00:57:27,641
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew
return to the US

813
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:32,222
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

814
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:34,932
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer;

815
00:57:35,057 --> 00:57:36,149
Frank Campana,

816
00:57:36,225 --> 00:57:38,978
and top contender; Marco Santos.

817
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:41,484
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

818
00:57:41,563 --> 00:57:43,440
The cage is your home.

819
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:44,946
You set the pace.

820
00:57:45,025 --> 00:57:46,698
You set the rhythm.

821
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:48,787
Feel the Beethoven.

822
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:52,583
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

823
00:57:53,242 --> 00:57:55,495
And when he does, that's your moment.

824
00:57:55,577 --> 00:57:57,329
I see it. I see it. I see it.

825
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,754
No, he did not tap you!

826
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,595
Physics teacher!
That's the best in the business, son.

827
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:08,010
You can do this, Son!

828
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,843
Smoother There's more in you!
You got more in you!

829
00:58:10,926 --> 00:58:12,018
We're not done yet!

830
00:58:12,094 --> 00:58:14,938
He's beating you! He's beating you!

831
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,983
You better push harden Marco!
Brendan 's running away!

832
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:24,031
And the winner by tap out

833
00:58:24,106 --> 00:58:26,950
”Irish” Brendan Conlon.

834
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:36,540
"...to each and every man in turn
but mirrors back his own mysterious self

835
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:41,624
"Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them.

836
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:44,256
”It cannot solve itself "

837
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,653
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

838
00:59:03,729 --> 00:59:06,073
-You wanna grab a bite?
-No. I'm gonna head home.

839
00:59:06,148 --> 00:59:08,901
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

840
00:59:10,152 --> 00:59:12,655
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Okay.

841
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:22,915
Coach!

842
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:30,806
Hey, I know this is not a really great time,

843
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:34,055
and it's too bad about Marco.

844
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:38,480
But how about me?

845
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:41,099
Are you talking about Sparta?

846
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,773
Yeah.

847
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:45,445
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

848
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,521
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

849
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,413
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

850
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:03,247
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

851
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,832
Yeah.

852
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,676
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out of the cage.

853
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:11,588
That's what I'm afraid of.

854
01:00:11,672 --> 01:00:13,174
Frank, I need this.

855
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:17,227
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

856
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:21,144
You're the guy. They trust you.

857
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:27,146
Brendan.

858
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:29,197
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

859
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:30,774
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

860
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:33,994
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

861
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:35,867
How does that benefit either one of us?

862
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:39,166
-It's not gonna happen.
-Not gonna happen?

863
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:41,209
Wish I had a nickel
for every time somebody told me that.

864
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:43,500
It's not gonna happen.

865
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:00,429
I'll make a call.

866
01:01:07,728 --> 01:01:10,572
I love my coach!

867
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:22,410
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

868
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:24,585
Yeah, he should.

869
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:27,210
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

870
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:30,338
it's like you're part of the family
or something.

871
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:36,052
Yeah, he's right here. it's your boyfriend.

872
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:39,722
Frank. Hey, man.

873
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:49,061
That's unbelievable.

874
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:54,153
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what to say.

875
01:01:55,942 --> 01:01:58,912
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

876
01:02:04,493 --> 01:02:06,791
All right. Bye.

877
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:09,665
I'm in.

878
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:13,044
-I'm going.
-Really?

879
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:17,673
That's your decision? You decided?

880
01:02:19,758 --> 01:02:21,931
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

881
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:25,014
about making that decision together.

882
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:33,489
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

883
01:02:33,563 --> 01:02:35,782
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

884
01:02:35,857 --> 01:02:37,780
and he's the guy they're watching.

885
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:38,826
It's a lot of money, Tess.

886
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:41,405
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

887
01:02:42,656 --> 01:02:44,658
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

888
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:46,209
before we pick up that prize money.

889
01:02:47,035 --> 01:02:49,129
You don't think I can do it, right?

890
01:02:49,371 --> 01:02:51,214
I think you could get killed.

891
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:57,300
-I'm not gonna get killed.
-You're not gonna get killed,

892
01:02:57,379 --> 01:02:58,801
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

893
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,474
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

894
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:04,099
We have no prize money, we have no house.

895
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:07,226
-We have payments for hospital bills.
-Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

896
01:03:08,723 --> 01:03:11,818
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

897
01:03:13,353 --> 01:03:15,447
How's that for a promise?

898
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:22,328
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

899
01:03:22,404 --> 01:03:25,658
But I'd really love it
if you'd be with me on this.

900
01:03:32,706 --> 01:03:35,175
I'm not gonna watch you fight again,
I'm not.

901
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,673
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

902
01:04:07,532 --> 01:04:11,036
Fourth of July weekend
doesn't officially get started until tomorrow,

903
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,588
but fight fans are already descending
on Atlantic City

904
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:17,509
for the Super Bowl
of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

905
01:04:17,584 --> 01:04:20,383
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

906
01:04:20,462 --> 01:04:21,884
we've got the red carpet!

907
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:25,467
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

908
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:28,394
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

909
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:30,184
You turned your back on Wall Street

910
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:32,607
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

911
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:35,936
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

912
01:04:36,102 --> 01:04:37,149
Growing up, we all wanted to know

913
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:39,448
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

914
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:41,365
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

915
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:43,159
And that's why I put this thing together

916
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:46,034
That's what all these people are here to see,
come Saturday night.

917
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:48,456
-That's what we're gonna find out.
-Thank you, J.J.

918
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:53,253
And here 's something fans never thought
they'd see. Koba is here.

919
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:56,753
The legend arriving to fiight on US soil
for the very first time.

920
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,832
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

921
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,886
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,
world Sambo champion,

922
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:03,760
undefeated in his mixed martial arts career.

923
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:06,933
Nobody's survived a round
with the Russian in five years.

924
01:05:07,008 --> 01:05:09,511
He is the greatest fighter..."

925
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,320
I mean, you've seen our logos.

926
01:05:22,399 --> 01:05:24,652
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

927
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:26,286
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

928
01:05:26,361 --> 01:05:28,455
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

929
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,032
No, I'm not sure.

930
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:04,112
Hey, Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

931
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,909
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

932
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,111
-Frank Campana?
-Yeah.

933
01:06:08,194 --> 01:06:09,912
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

934
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:11,786
-Julia, how are you?
-Brendan Conlon?

935
01:06:11,865 --> 01:06:13,708
-Yeah, hi. Hey.
-Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

936
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:15,000
-Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

937
01:06:15,076 --> 01:06:16,293
A few things I want to let you guys know.

938
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:19,293
-Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
-Okay.

939
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:21,545
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

940
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:22,921
Tommy!

941
01:06:23,168 --> 01:06:25,136
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

942
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,130
Can we stand with J.J.?

943
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:29,800
”Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

944
01:06:29,883 --> 01:06:33,854
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

945
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:38,183
”But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

946
01:06:38,266 --> 01:06:42,021
"seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions,

947
01:06:42,103 --> 01:06:46,233
"bethinking it,
it may be a larger and nobler foe.

948
01:06:46,316 --> 01:06:49,946
”Of a sudden,
he bore down upon its advancing prow,

949
01:06:50,028 --> 01:06:53,953
"smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam.

950
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:57,501
”Ahab staggered,
his hand smote his forehead.

951
01:06:57,577 --> 01:06:59,329
"'l grow blind... "'

952
01:06:59,412 --> 01:07:01,164
Now, the only person missing
from the event

953
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,750
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan

954
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:07,758
Recent revelations that Riordan
was not only a United States Marine,

955
01:07:07,837 --> 01:07:11,717
but a hero in the Iraq Wan
has cast an even wider spotlight

956
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,394
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere.

957
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:17,564
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

958
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,108
who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,

959
01:07:20,183 --> 01:07:23,153
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

960
01:07:23,228 --> 01:07:24,354
Tommy!

961
01:07:24,437 --> 01:07:25,939
And the bridge just crumbled.

962
01:07:26,022 --> 01:07:28,775
Tommy, come here.
Come on. You got to see this.

963
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:33,614
The amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere.

964
01:07:34,948 --> 01:07:37,747
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

965
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:40,003
We were all drowning, man.

966
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:42,626
It was a death trap.

967
01:07:42,914 --> 01:07:44,461
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

968
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,507
Then suddenly,
the back ramp gets ripped off

969
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,260
There he was.

970
01:07:54,175 --> 01:07:56,223
And before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.

971
01:07:56,845 --> 01:07:59,189
-He just vanished like a ghost.
-Tom my?

972
01:07:59,264 --> 01:08:02,518
-Tommy, did you... Where you going?
-Taking a walk.

973
01:08:04,018 --> 01:08:05,065
Tommy!

974
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:08,365
I really just wanted to say thank you.

975
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:11,652
You saved my life, brother

976
01:08:12,986 --> 01:08:17,162
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

977
01:08:17,866 --> 01:08:21,120
you reach out to Tommy Riordan
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

978
01:08:21,202 --> 01:08:24,126
Footage taken from a helmet cam
on the ground in Iraq

979
01:08:24,205 --> 01:08:26,583
captured the heroic incident.

980
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:27,963
Hello?

981
01:08:28,418 --> 01:08:29,544
Brendan?

982
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:13,054
Been looking all over for you.

983
01:09:15,173 --> 01:09:17,642
How's it going?

984
01:09:17,717 --> 01:09:19,435
It's going.

985
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:24,690
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

986
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:29,105
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

987
01:09:31,523 --> 01:09:32,649
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

988
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,362
I'm good right here.

989
01:09:39,364 --> 01:09:40,581
Okay.

990
01:09:46,037 --> 01:09:50,133
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

991
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,585
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

992
01:09:53,461 --> 01:09:54,929
You had the information.

993
01:09:57,507 --> 01:10:00,135
You chose the old man and the girl.

994
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:02,266
She wasn't just some girl.

995
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:06,645
I married her.

996
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:11,480
She's my wife.

997
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:13,736
See?

998
01:10:13,815 --> 01:10:16,238
That's Tess.

999
01:10:16,317 --> 01:10:18,695
That's Emily and Rosie.

1000
01:10:18,778 --> 01:10:20,906
They're your nieces, Tommy.

1001
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:22,616
I don't know them.

1002
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:26,545
I know you don't know them.
Of course you don't know them.

1003
01:10:26,828 --> 01:10:30,173
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1004
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,259
'Cause that's my family.

1005
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:37,255
And who are you exactly?

1006
01:10:42,343 --> 01:10:43,686
I'm your brother, man.

1007
01:10:47,015 --> 01:10:48,392
You were in the Corps?

1008
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,352
What?

1009
01:10:50,435 --> 01:10:53,689
-I said I didn't Know you were in the Corps.
-I wasn't in the Corps.

1010
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:57,116
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1011
01:10:58,359 --> 01:10:59,702
My brother was in the Corps.

1012
01:11:00,361 --> 01:11:01,954
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1013
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:05,496
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1014
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:07,000
I don't know what you know.

1015
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:08,703
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?

1016
01:11:08,786 --> 01:11:10,379
She's my wife, Tommy.

1017
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:13,750
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,
I never get to see you guys again?

1018
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,211
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1019
01:11:17,837 --> 01:11:20,215
God, man, I don't understand this.

1020
01:11:20,965 --> 01:11:22,387
What? You...

1021
01:11:22,467 --> 01:11:26,142
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1022
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:32,477
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,
you know? He means nothing to me.

1023
01:11:34,062 --> 01:11:36,906
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1024
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,619
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1025
01:11:41,694 --> 01:11:43,446
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1026
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:46,328
I got children, man. I got a family to protect.

1027
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:48,409
Everything I do is for them.

1028
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,958
I forgave Pop.

1029
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:52,880
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1030
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:01,756
You forgave us?

1031
01:12:03,675 --> 01:12:04,972
Yeah.

1032
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:08,062
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1033
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:10,231
You got some stones, man.

1034
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:12,900
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1035
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:15,694
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1036
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:19,274
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1037
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:23,203
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1038
01:12:23,277 --> 01:12:24,324
God.

1039
01:12:24,404 --> 01:12:28,034
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1040
01:12:28,116 --> 01:12:30,790
You leave, you get to bury people.

1041
01:12:30,868 --> 01:12:33,792
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1042
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:38,009
I didn't even know she was sick.

1043
01:12:39,544 --> 01:12:43,139
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1044
01:12:46,134 --> 01:12:49,684
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1045
01:12:51,848 --> 01:12:54,146
You know what?

1046
01:12:54,225 --> 01:12:57,650
You walk around
with your pictures of your wife,

1047
01:12:57,729 --> 01:13:00,027
and you're all, "I forgive you.

1048
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:02,651
"l forgive Pop.

1049
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:04,907
"l forgive everyone."

1050
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:06,488
Brendan, you know,

1051
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:09,995
you're full of shit.

1052
01:13:16,164 --> 01:13:18,792
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1053
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:41,322
You realize you're supposed to seek
my wise counsel

1054
01:13:41,397 --> 01:13:43,525
while school's actually in session, right?

1055
01:13:43,608 --> 01:13:45,531
-Yes, Principal Z.
-Tell him.

1056
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,908
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1057
01:13:47,987 --> 01:13:49,955
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1058
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:51,704
What do you say?

1059
01:13:51,783 --> 01:13:53,456
So, you want to use the auditorium

1060
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:57,164
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1061
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:58,498
-Right.
-Am I hearing this correct?

1062
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,458
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1063
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:02,384
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1064
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,508
You know,
I think you need to talk to your parents,

1065
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:06,715
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1066
01:14:06,798 --> 01:14:08,220
-Everybody wants this.
-Come on, Mr. Zito.

1067
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:09,801
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1068
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:10,885
-Exactly.
-And the gym's the only place

1069
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:13,266
-that's big enough to fit everyone.
-Look, it's never gonna happen.

1070
01:14:13,346 --> 01:14:15,849
-What if we get a petition signed?
-We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1071
01:14:15,932 --> 01:14:17,809
-The power of democracy.
-What are they gonna do about that?

1072
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:18,859
Mr. Z, please?

1073
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:21,984
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1074
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:25,112
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1075
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:02,737
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1076
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:07,739
It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1077
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:12,038
This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,

1078
01:15:12,113 --> 01:15:15,037
and this is
what everyone's been waiting for

1079
01:15:15,116 --> 01:15:19,963
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1080
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:23,462
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.

1081
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:26,545
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1082
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:29,676
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair

1083
01:15:29,755 --> 01:15:35,057
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1084
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:38,265
Sparta is here!

1085
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:40,357
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1086
01:15:40,433 --> 01:15:43,186
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1087
01:15:43,311 --> 01:15:46,360
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1088
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,316
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1089
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,324
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1090
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:55,619
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1091
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:58,121
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1092
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,625
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1093
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:03,502
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1094
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:07,927
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1095
01:16:08,002 --> 01:16:10,425
who has become an overnight sensation

1096
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:12,506
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1097
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,354
...Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1098
01:16:18,429 --> 01:16:21,683
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career

1099
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:24,527
Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.

1100
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:30,240
-Five minutes, Paddy.
-Okay.

1101
01:16:32,276 --> 01:16:35,871
It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,

1102
01:16:35,947 --> 01:16:38,666
-because here comes Tommy Riordan.
-Wow!

1103
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:40,960
Tommy Riordan 's
captured the media 's attention,

1104
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:43,003
but the question still remains.

1105
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:44,456
Who is this guy?

1106
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:46,006
And more importantly,

1107
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:49,006
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1108
01:16:49,085 --> 01:16:50,837
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1109
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,641
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1110
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,888
In an Internet age
where there are no secrets,

1111
01:16:56,968 --> 01:16:58,845
this guy's a complete mystery.

1112
01:16:58,928 --> 01:17:00,896
I can't find out anything about him.

1113
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,059
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1114
01:17:06,852 --> 01:17:08,729
Get your hands off me.

1115
01:17:10,022 --> 01:17:11,069
Okay, let's go.

1116
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:12,445
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1117
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:15,404
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1118
01:17:15,528 --> 01:17:17,371
He skipped the press conference,

1119
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:19,824
wouldn't have his picture taken
for the program.

1120
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,659
He's breaking every rule.

1121
01:17:22,368 --> 01:17:24,996
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1122
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:29,585
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1123
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,386
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1124
01:17:32,461 --> 01:17:34,054
is because of another video.

1125
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,804
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1126
01:17:36,882 --> 01:17:38,634
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1127
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:41,012
for the few that haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1128
01:17:41,095 --> 01:17:44,645
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off a tank

1129
01:17:44,724 --> 01:17:47,694
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1130
01:17:47,768 --> 01:17:49,736
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1131
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,155
-Listen...
-He ripped the door off a tank.

1132
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,107
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1133
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:56,535
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's a very, very tough guy,

1134
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,284
-but the tank don't hit back, you know.
-Sam...

1135
01:17:59,363 --> 01:18:01,786
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1136
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:04,335
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1137
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,916
Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full

1138
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,502
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1139
01:18:12,585 --> 01:18:14,053
-Francisco Barbosa...
-He's nothing to scoff at.

1140
01:18:14,128 --> 01:18:15,846
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1141
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:20,093
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1142
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:21,849
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1143
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:24,305
and I 'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.

1144
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:25,389
It's a great story,

1145
01:18:25,473 --> 01:18:28,522
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1146
01:18:28,642 --> 01:18:30,064
-as a YouTube sensation.
-Well, well,

1147
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:33,273
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1148
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:35,532
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1149
01:18:35,608 --> 01:18:37,155
I expect a clean fight.

1150
01:18:37,234 --> 01:18:38,577
Obey my command at all times,

1151
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:39,949
defend yourselves at all times.

1152
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:41,826
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1153
01:18:44,408 --> 01:18:46,456
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1154
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,003
just like we know. Just like we know.

1155
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,958
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1156
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,259
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1157
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:55,553
-Gentlemen, you ready?
-They are both game fighters.

1158
01:18:55,628 --> 01:18:57,380
-And here we go.
-You ready?

1159
01:18:57,505 --> 01:18:58,597
Let's go to war!

1160
01:18:58,672 --> 01:19:00,265
Keep your focus, Tom.

1161
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,093
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1162
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:03,553
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1163
01:19:03,636 --> 01:19:05,684
He's definitely looking for a takedown here.

1164
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:13,529
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1165
01:19:13,604 --> 01:19:16,778
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1166
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:20,452
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1167
01:19:20,528 --> 01:19:22,075
Hey, Tommy!

1168
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:24,248
There goes another rule, out the window!

1169
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:26,375
Where you going?

1170
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:29,500
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1171
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:32,252
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1172
01:19:33,165 --> 01:19:35,167
-A huge left hook, launching...
-Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1173
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:38,130
-... Tommy Riordan into the second round.
-One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1174
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,761
Good. Two, three.

1175
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,513
Good. Good, good, good.

1176
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,470
-Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
-Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1177
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:49,648
-Showtime.
-All right. Come on, give me eight.

1178
01:19:52,143 --> 01:19:54,316
Yes! That's my boy.

1179
01:20:37,271 --> 01:20:38,944
Let's go, move your head around.

1180
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:46,909
You ready?

1181
01:20:50,743 --> 01:20:52,120
Look at me.

1182
01:20:56,415 --> 01:20:57,712
You can do this.

1183
01:21:04,298 --> 01:21:06,096
I wanna hear you say it.

1184
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:12,727
I can do this.

1185
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:15,226
Let's go do this.

1186
01:21:16,936 --> 01:21:18,188
Yeah.

1187
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,526
Yeah.

1188
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:36,172
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1189
01:21:36,247 --> 01:21:39,126
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1190
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,302
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1191
01:21:41,377 --> 01:21:43,129
which is really something
I don't understand.

1192
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:45,180
I just... I'm shocked.

1193
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,308
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1194
01:21:55,432 --> 01:21:56,684
Go. Good luck.

1195
01:21:57,768 --> 01:21:59,441
Let's go, Brendan.

1196
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:02,155
You go get him, Son!

1197
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:04,325
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1198
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,950
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1199
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:10,827
This is Beethoven.
This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1200
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:12,874
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1201
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:16,083
Go get him, Son.

1202
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:19,756
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1203
01:22:19,832 --> 01:22:22,881
Very unorthodox trainer,
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1204
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:27,215
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1205
01:22:27,298 --> 01:22:30,723
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1206
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:34,431
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1207
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:37,232
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1208
01:22:37,391 --> 01:22:38,734
-Come on.
-In fact, let me show you something.

1209
01:22:38,809 --> 01:22:39,810
Right here. Let me tell you...

1210
01:22:39,893 --> 01:22:41,315
-What?
-You see that, right there?

1211
01:22:41,395 --> 01:22:45,241
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1212
01:22:45,441 --> 01:22:49,196
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a shark tank.

1213
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:50,530
He's a feeder fish.

1214
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:52,114
Come on, give the guy a break.

1215
01:22:52,197 --> 01:22:54,541
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1216
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:57,085
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1217
01:22:57,161 --> 01:22:59,129
-We remember him from that.
-I remember him, too.

1218
01:22:59,204 --> 01:23:01,252
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1219
01:23:21,352 --> 01:23:24,572
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1220
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:25,693
When the brackets were announced,

1221
01:23:25,773 --> 01:23:27,616
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1222
01:23:27,691 --> 01:23:30,661
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1223
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:32,830
Hey! You asked for it.

1224
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:36,208
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1225
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:38,877
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1226
01:23:38,952 --> 01:23:41,876
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1227
01:23:41,955 --> 01:23:44,629
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1228
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:48,053
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation.

1229
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:51,803
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1230
01:23:51,882 --> 01:23:53,850
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1231
01:23:53,926 --> 01:23:57,556
-Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
-Gentlemen.

1232
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:01,559
Go get him.

1233
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:06,317
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1234
01:24:06,397 --> 01:24:07,819
I expect a clean fight.

1235
01:24:07,898 --> 01:24:11,402
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1236
01:24:11,485 --> 01:24:13,658
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1237
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:16,991
Go have some fun, baby.

1238
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:22,497
Gentlemen, you ready?

1239
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:26,175
You ready? Let's go to war!

1240
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:33,511
Work your kicks!

1241
01:24:36,427 --> 01:24:38,054
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1242
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:40,014
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1243
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:42,600
Let it out! Come on, move!

1244
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,488
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1245
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:49,982
In and out!

1246
01:24:56,363 --> 01:24:57,865
Get off the fence!

1247
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:01,373
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1248
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:04,921
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1249
01:25:06,373 --> 01:25:07,795
There he goes!

1250
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,218
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1251
01:25:09,835 --> 01:25:11,132
Come on!

1252
01:25:12,045 --> 01:25:13,092
Get up!

1253
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,718
-Come on! Come on!
-Watch the back of the head!

1254
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,973
-Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
-Midnight is all over Brendan.

1255
01:25:19,052 --> 01:25:21,555
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1256
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:24,061
The teacher just has no answers.

1257
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:26,143
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1258
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:29,942
-And now, he's got the hooks in.
-The hooks are in.

1259
01:25:30,022 --> 01:25:32,070
-Brendan in very big trouble.
-The end is close.

1260
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:34,068
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1261
01:25:34,943 --> 01:25:35,990
Well, he's got the choke.

1262
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:37,662
-He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
-Come on.

1263
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:40,833
...and Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1264
01:25:40,908 --> 01:25:43,206
Get up! Find his legs!

1265
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:45,162
Hips! Hip down!

1266
01:25:45,245 --> 01:25:47,623
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1267
01:25:47,706 --> 01:25:49,174
Get your weight down!

1268
01:25:49,249 --> 01:25:51,718
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got it very deep.

1269
01:25:51,793 --> 01:25:54,387
-Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
-Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1270
01:25:54,505 --> 01:25:56,633
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1271
01:25:57,174 --> 01:25:58,175
Hold on, Brendan.

1272
01:25:58,258 --> 01:25:59,760
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1273
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:01,811
'cause his whole world's about to go
from day to night.

1274
01:26:01,887 --> 01:26:04,140
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1275
01:26:07,267 --> 01:26:09,440
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1276
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,693
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1277
01:26:14,274 --> 01:26:16,322
Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.

1278
01:26:17,277 --> 01:26:18,824
Jesus.

1279
01:26:21,823 --> 01:26:24,246
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1280
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:28,206
You should've had him in the first round.

1281
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:32,460
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't know what hit him.

1282
01:26:32,543 --> 01:26:34,386
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1283
01:26:34,962 --> 01:26:36,134
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1284
01:26:36,421 --> 01:26:38,594
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1285
01:26:38,674 --> 01:26:41,018
Deep breath, deep breath.
I want you to do something.

1286
01:26:42,135 --> 01:26:43,808
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1287
01:26:43,887 --> 01:26:46,640
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1288
01:26:46,723 --> 01:26:49,818
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1289
01:26:49,893 --> 01:26:50,940
and hear what he's saying in there.

1290
01:26:51,019 --> 01:26:52,692
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1291
01:26:52,771 --> 01:26:55,775
And I want you to trade punches
with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1292
01:26:56,984 --> 01:26:58,736
Let's go, seconds out!

1293
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:00,036
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1294
01:27:00,112 --> 01:27:01,238
This round, knock him out.

1295
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:03,415
-Let's do it.
-He doesn't deserve to be here.

1296
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,458
Beautiful. Breathe.

1297
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:06,831
Let's go!

1298
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:12,549
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1299
01:27:12,624 --> 01:27:13,716
Nice and easy!

1300
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,753
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1301
01:27:16,837 --> 01:27:18,839
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1302
01:27:34,688 --> 01:27:37,441
Circle around! Circle around!

1303
01:27:38,108 --> 01:27:39,155
Nice and easy!

1304
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:41,696
Good, good!

1305
01:27:41,778 --> 01:27:43,780
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1306
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:50,459
Get Out Of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1307
01:27:51,913 --> 01:27:54,257
Get out of there!
Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!

1308
01:27:56,543 --> 01:27:57,715
Do something.

1309
01:28:00,547 --> 01:28:01,639
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1310
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:03,429
Shoot on him!

1311
01:28:06,178 --> 01:28:07,270
Yes!

1312
01:28:07,346 --> 01:28:09,440
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1313
01:28:09,514 --> 01:28:11,016
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1314
01:28:12,225 --> 01:28:14,068
-Scissors takedown.
-A beautiful scissors takedown.

1315
01:28:14,144 --> 01:28:16,021
-Really nice.
-Conlon showing signs of life

1316
01:28:16,104 --> 01:28:17,902
and not backing down.

1317
01:28:17,981 --> 01:28:19,198
Knees, knees!

1318
01:28:22,778 --> 01:28:23,825
Good!

1319
01:28:23,904 --> 01:28:26,032
Take his arm! Good!

1320
01:28:27,115 --> 01:28:29,994
-He's got a kimura lock!
-He's got a very good kimura.

1321
01:28:30,077 --> 01:28:33,422
Turn your hips in! In!

1322
01:28:33,497 --> 01:28:36,467
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1323
01:28:38,377 --> 01:28:40,345
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1324
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,717
Turn your hips in!

1325
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:44,433
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1326
01:28:44,549 --> 01:28:46,677
Turn your hips up and in!

1327
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:48,853
Hips up! Very good!

1328
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:50,521
He's in a lot of trouble.

1329
01:28:50,597 --> 01:28:52,440
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1330
01:28:52,516 --> 01:28:55,486
-Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
-Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1331
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,652
Midnight is in big trouble.

1332
01:28:56,728 --> 01:28:59,698
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1333
01:28:59,773 --> 01:29:01,400
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1334
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:03,326
Brendan Conlon has got
him in a very, very dangerous position

1335
01:29:03,402 --> 01:29:05,075
-and Midnight is in big trouble.
-Midnight...

1336
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:06,621
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1337
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,782
You got it! You got it!

1338
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:12,373
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1339
01:29:12,828 --> 01:29:16,002
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1340
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:17,958
-This can't happen.
-It just did, Bryan.

1341
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:19,209
He tapped!

1342
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:21,344
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1343
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,889
-I can't believe that.
-Oh, my goodness!

1344
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:26,683
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1345
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:33,015
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1346
01:29:33,306 --> 01:29:34,649
Honey, he tapped him out!

1347
01:29:34,766 --> 01:29:37,861
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1348
01:29:37,936 --> 01:29:40,564
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1349
01:29:41,022 --> 01:29:43,445
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1350
01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:45,277
There's so many ways to lose.

1351
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:49,706
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1352
01:29:49,781 --> 01:29:52,204
Which is probably why Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1353
01:29:52,284 --> 01:29:57,085
And I honestly don't think either
one of them can believe what just happened.

1354
01:29:57,164 --> 01:29:59,633
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1355
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:02,382
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1356
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:04,088
something all his fighters buy into,

1357
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,139
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1358
01:30:06,214 --> 01:30:07,932
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1359
01:30:08,008 --> 01:30:10,010
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1360
01:30:10,093 --> 01:30:11,390
but, instead, he's going home.

1361
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:15,691
Dominated the fight the entire way,
but he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1362
01:30:15,766 --> 01:30:17,814
A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.

1363
01:30:17,893 --> 01:30:19,861
-I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
-I don't know.

1364
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:22,780
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure

1365
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:24,699
and waiting for his opportunity.

1366
01:30:25,692 --> 01:30:28,946
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1367
01:30:30,697 --> 01:30:32,574
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1368
01:30:55,514 --> 01:30:56,686
Yes!

1369
01:30:58,558 --> 01:30:59,559
Okay.

1370
01:31:11,655 --> 01:31:13,657
We 're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1371
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:16,539
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1372
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,166
-Right hand.
-Huge right hand.

1373
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:24,627
-Huge right hand.
-Oh, my goodness.

1374
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,054
Oh, my God! This is over.

1375
01:31:27,128 --> 01:31:29,051
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1376
01:31:29,422 --> 01:31:32,016
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1377
01:31:32,092 --> 01:31:33,469
That's certainly possible.

1378
01:31:33,593 --> 01:31:36,016
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1379
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:38,098
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

1380
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:41,860
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1381
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:43,687
Like a man with something to prove,

1382
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:47,775
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest.

1383
01:31:47,983 --> 01:31:52,113
He wanted to send a message to
Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1384
01:31:52,696 --> 01:31:54,869
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1385
01:31:54,948 --> 01:31:57,371
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1386
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:58,952
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1387
01:31:59,035 --> 01:32:01,584
Brendan! You can do it.

1388
01:32:04,374 --> 01:32:07,173
Halfway through round three, now,
and the beating continues.

1389
01:32:07,252 --> 01:32:11,302
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1390
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:13,304
He has been battered without mercy

1391
01:32:13,383 --> 01:32:14,851
-in both of his fights today.
-Relax! You're okay!

1392
01:32:14,926 --> 01:32:16,599
He's still standing, Bryan.

1393
01:32:18,513 --> 01:32:19,765
Beethoven!

1394
01:32:19,848 --> 01:32:21,441
No! No, no, no!

1395
01:32:23,476 --> 01:32:24,728
Good, take him down!

1396
01:32:26,104 --> 01:32:27,731
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1397
01:32:27,814 --> 01:32:28,861
Hold on to him.

1398
01:32:29,232 --> 01:32:31,576
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the armbar.

1399
01:32:31,651 --> 01:32:33,494
-He's got an armbar.
-He's got that armbar.

1400
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,368
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1401
01:32:35,447 --> 01:32:36,994
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1402
01:32:37,908 --> 01:32:40,331
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1403
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:42,504
He's got that arm, Sam!

1404
01:32:42,662 --> 01:32:45,085
-Break, break, break, break!
-Yes!

1405
01:32:45,165 --> 01:32:46,212
Are you kidding me?

1406
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:48,089
Yes!

1407
01:32:48,168 --> 01:32:50,546
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1408
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:53,929
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1409
01:32:54,257 --> 01:32:55,600
I think I'm a believer.

1410
01:32:56,009 --> 01:32:58,512
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1411
01:32:58,678 --> 01:33:00,225
-I'm doing this!
-Okay.

1412
01:33:00,305 --> 01:33:01,522
-I'm doing it!
-Okay.

1413
01:33:01,598 --> 01:33:02,815
Okay, Son.

1414
01:33:03,475 --> 01:33:06,479
The crowd catching fire
for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1415
01:33:08,021 --> 01:33:09,773
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1416
01:33:09,856 --> 01:33:12,484
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1417
01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:14,285
He's just here to fight.

1418
01:33:14,361 --> 01:33:16,830
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1419
01:33:16,905 --> 01:33:18,373
Gentlemen, you ready?

1420
01:33:19,282 --> 01:33:20,454
Are you ready?

1421
01:33:20,533 --> 01:33:22,752
-Let's go to war!
-Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1422
01:33:23,787 --> 01:33:25,960
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1423
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,799
-Yeah.
-He is all over Diego Santana.

1424
01:33:34,172 --> 01:33:37,051
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1425
01:33:37,175 --> 01:33:38,176
Oh, my goodness!

1426
01:33:46,726 --> 01:33:49,855
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1427
01:33:49,938 --> 01:33:52,782
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1428
01:33:52,857 --> 01:33:56,532
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1429
01:33:56,611 --> 01:33:59,239
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1430
01:34:25,932 --> 01:34:28,151
-So where is he?
-Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1431
01:34:28,852 --> 01:34:30,479
Make a right at that white sign...

1432
01:34:39,988 --> 01:34:42,787
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1433
01:34:49,914 --> 01:34:53,293
I know that that other thing is

1434
01:34:55,754 --> 01:34:58,348
bothering the hell out of you.

1435
01:34:59,758 --> 01:35:01,931
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1436
01:35:02,844 --> 01:35:05,518
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1437
01:35:06,264 --> 01:35:08,312
that was really something.

1438
01:35:11,436 --> 01:35:13,564
How about deserting my unit?

1439
01:35:15,106 --> 01:35:17,325
Is that really something, too?

1440
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:21,697
Yeah.

1441
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:26,494
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1442
01:35:27,327 --> 01:35:29,125
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1443
01:35:29,204 --> 01:35:30,330
No.

1444
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:35,919
-What did you do?
-What did I do?

1445
01:35:38,671 --> 01:35:40,139
I took off.

1446
01:35:43,676 --> 01:35:45,895
That's why you go by Riorolan.

1447
01:35:47,222 --> 01:35:50,351
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1448
01:35:53,645 --> 01:35:56,444
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1449
01:35:57,649 --> 01:35:59,492
That is none of your business, man.

1450
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:02,411
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1451
01:36:02,487 --> 01:36:04,956
I've done it, I've seen it.

1452
01:36:05,031 --> 01:36:06,624
You can trust me. I understand.

1453
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:09,748
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1454
01:36:11,037 --> 01:36:12,880
The suit don't fit.

1455
01:36:13,706 --> 01:36:14,878
Tommy.

1456
01:36:15,792 --> 01:36:17,840
I'm really trying here.

1457
01:36:18,753 --> 01:36:21,427
-You're trying?
-Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1458
01:36:21,548 --> 01:36:22,674
Now?

1459
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:27,687
Where were you when it mattered?

1460
01:36:28,763 --> 01:36:32,734
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1461
01:36:33,476 --> 01:36:36,901
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1462
01:36:37,897 --> 01:36:40,992
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1463
01:36:41,693 --> 01:36:44,617
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1464
01:36:44,696 --> 01:36:47,996
The only thing that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1465
01:36:48,074 --> 01:36:49,951
is that the pair of us,

1466
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,838
we have absolutely no use for you.

1467
01:36:58,376 --> 01:36:59,753
Look at you.

1468
01:37:01,004 --> 01:37:03,553
Yeah, I was right.

1469
01:37:04,257 --> 01:37:06,351
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1470
01:37:06,426 --> 01:37:08,554
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1471
01:37:08,636 --> 01:37:12,812
tiptoeing around,
like some beggar with your cup out.

1472
01:37:15,602 --> 01:37:17,821
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1473
01:37:17,896 --> 01:37:18,943
Here's a cup.

1474
01:37:19,022 --> 01:37:22,401
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more of your shitty tapes...

1475
01:37:22,483 --> 01:37:24,360
-Don't do this, Tommy.
-...and you go back to the room

1476
01:37:24,444 --> 01:37:26,117
-and you listen to some more...
-Don't do this.

1477
01:37:26,196 --> 01:37:29,700
...fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1478
01:37:31,451 --> 01:37:33,795
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1479
01:38:13,076 --> 01:38:14,623
God pity them!

1480
01:38:15,203 --> 01:38:17,706
All shall perish except me!

1481
01:38:21,709 --> 01:38:25,259
Bastards. Bastards!

1482
01:38:26,506 --> 01:38:29,510
You bastards. You bastards!

1483
01:38:29,926 --> 01:38:33,100
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1484
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:35,523
Ishmael. God pity them.

1485
01:38:36,224 --> 01:38:39,649
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1486
01:38:41,854 --> 01:38:44,448
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1487
01:38:45,858 --> 01:38:47,201
Ahab.

1488
01:38:47,902 --> 01:38:50,371
You godless son of a bitch!

1489
01:38:50,446 --> 01:38:52,323
You stop the ship!

1490
01:38:52,407 --> 01:38:55,536
You godless son of a bitch!

1491
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:59,630
"'The whale! The ship! '
cried the cringing oarsmen.

1492
01:38:59,706 --> 01:39:01,708
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward...

1493
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:03,008
Stop it.

1494
01:39:03,209 --> 01:39:05,758
”'O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1495
01:39:05,837 --> 01:39:09,262
"Ahab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'

1496
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:12,472
Captain...

1497
01:39:13,678 --> 01:39:15,601
Stop the...

1498
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,978
Captain, stop...

1499
01:39:18,057 --> 01:39:20,401
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1500
01:39:21,894 --> 01:39:23,896
For the love of God.

1501
01:39:25,023 --> 01:39:26,616
They're lost.

1502
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:29,573
Stop it... The ship.

1503
01:39:33,573 --> 01:39:34,790
Ahab...

1504
01:39:37,952 --> 01:39:39,579
You stop the...

1505
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,547
Oh, no.

1506
01:39:50,006 --> 01:39:52,054
-Come on, give me the Walkman.
-No.

1507
01:39:52,133 --> 01:39:54,352
-No, no.
-Come on.

1508
01:39:54,427 --> 01:39:56,304
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1509
01:39:56,387 --> 01:39:58,355
Come here, come here, come here.

1510
01:39:58,431 --> 01:40:00,775
-Come on. Give me.
-No.

1511
01:40:11,069 --> 01:40:12,412
Tommy.

1512
01:40:13,404 --> 01:40:15,122
We're lost.

1513
01:40:16,866 --> 01:40:18,618
We're lost, Tommy.

1514
01:40:20,286 --> 01:40:23,415
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1515
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:28,010
-Stay down.
-We'll never make it back.

1516
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:40,182
I'm here.

1517
01:40:45,853 --> 01:40:47,651
I always loved you.

1518
01:40:49,816 --> 01:40:52,194
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1519
01:40:52,985 --> 01:40:54,783
I always loved you.

1520
01:40:56,322 --> 01:40:59,701
You and your brother. My two boys.

1521
01:41:15,216 --> 01:41:18,516
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1522
01:41:32,066 --> 01:41:35,661
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1523
01:41:40,658 --> 01:41:42,877
Once again, no walk-out music.

1524
01:41:46,038 --> 01:41:48,541
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1525
01:41:53,379 --> 01:41:56,599
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1526
01:41:56,674 --> 01:41:58,676
I've never seen anything like this.

1527
01:42:15,943 --> 01:42:18,662
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
for the first time

1528
01:42:18,738 --> 01:42:20,911
and climbing into the cage.

1529
01:42:25,578 --> 01:42:27,831
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1530
01:42:27,914 --> 01:42:30,633
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1531
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:32,551
and turned his life upside down.

1532
01:42:32,627 --> 01:42:36,348
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1533
01:42:37,882 --> 01:42:42,353
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1534
01:42:42,428 --> 01:42:45,728
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1535
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:50,778
All right, gentlemen.

1536
01:42:55,441 --> 01:42:56,988
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1537
01:42:57,068 --> 01:42:58,365
I expect a clean fight.

1538
01:42:58,444 --> 01:43:01,368
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1539
01:43:01,447 --> 01:43:03,324
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1540
01:43:03,407 --> 01:43:05,284
It's not gonna happen again.

1541
01:43:06,786 --> 01:43:10,416
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1542
01:43:10,498 --> 01:43:11,920
He predicted an early knockout.

1543
01:43:11,999 --> 01:43:14,718
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1544
01:43:14,794 --> 01:43:17,343
And by the way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1545
01:43:17,421 --> 01:43:20,300
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1546
01:43:21,801 --> 01:43:23,303
Gentlemen, you ready?

1547
01:43:23,928 --> 01:43:25,145
You ready?

1548
01:43:27,056 --> 01:43:29,275
-Let's go to war!
-Here they go and they are off!

1549
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:33,233
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1550
01:43:33,312 --> 01:43:34,985
He's raining bombs!

1551
01:43:35,314 --> 01:43:37,487
-Cover up!
-Come on, work it.

1552
01:43:38,568 --> 01:43:40,195
-Raining bombs.
-Mad Dog is out.

1553
01:43:40,278 --> 01:43:42,406
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1554
01:43:42,488 --> 01:43:43,990
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1555
01:43:45,992 --> 01:43:48,040
Break! Break! Break!

1556
01:43:50,788 --> 01:43:52,586
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1557
01:43:52,665 --> 01:43:56,135
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1558
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,641
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1559
01:44:01,716 --> 01:44:03,309
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1560
01:44:03,384 --> 01:44:06,137
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1561
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:09,394
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1562
01:44:15,146 --> 01:44:18,025
-Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
-Sparta!

1563
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,958
Yeah!

1564
01:44:32,955 --> 01:44:34,457
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1565
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:35,962
I'm on your side.

1566
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:46,553
Let's go.

1567
01:44:46,844 --> 01:44:49,688
-Principal Zito, there he is.
-Nice.

1568
01:44:53,726 --> 01:44:55,399
Let's go, Brendan.

1569
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:02,361
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1570
01:45:02,443 --> 01:45:04,662
and now here he is in the final four.

1571
01:45:04,737 --> 01:45:08,332
The crowd snowing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1572
01:45:08,407 --> 01:45:12,332
He's got a huge reception.
I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1573
01:45:13,579 --> 01:45:15,547
Come on, come on. You all right?

1574
01:45:17,958 --> 01:45:19,801
You've got a visitor.

1575
01:45:22,004 --> 01:45:23,972
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1576
01:45:32,431 --> 01:45:33,683
You all right with that?

1577
01:45:38,604 --> 01:45:39,651
I love you.

1578
01:45:43,109 --> 01:45:45,328
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1579
01:45:45,403 --> 01:45:49,124
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is larger than life.

1580
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:52,452
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

1581
01:45:57,748 --> 01:46:01,218
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1582
01:46:01,293 --> 01:46:04,012
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1583
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:33,538
I'm proud of you, brother.

1584
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,878
This is your cage.

1585
01:46:47,673 --> 01:46:49,095
Gentlemen.

1586
01:46:57,016 --> 01:46:58,563
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1587
01:46:58,642 --> 01:47:00,110
I expect a clean fight.

1588
01:47:00,186 --> 01:47:02,939
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1589
01:47:03,022 --> 01:47:05,571
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1590
01:47:09,445 --> 01:47:12,119
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1591
01:47:12,198 --> 01:47:14,371
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1592
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:17,545
-Well, here we go.
-He's like a machine. Look at him.

1593
01:47:20,206 --> 01:47:21,879
Gentlemen, you ready?

1594
01:47:22,374 --> 01:47:24,092
You ready? Let's go to war!

1595
01:47:24,168 --> 01:47:25,670
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1596
01:47:25,753 --> 01:47:29,678
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1597
01:47:29,882 --> 01:47:31,054
Angle out of it!

1598
01:47:33,052 --> 01:47:34,554
Keep moving!

1599
01:47:36,138 --> 01:47:38,641
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1600
01:47:42,895 --> 01:47:45,148
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1601
01:47:45,231 --> 01:47:46,949
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1602
01:47:49,026 --> 01:47:51,074
-Crushing body shots.
-Relax, you're okay.

1603
01:47:51,153 --> 01:47:53,076
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1604
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:54,532
Get up! Get up!

1605
01:47:54,615 --> 01:47:56,583
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1606
01:47:56,826 --> 01:47:58,203
Go, go, go. Get up!

1607
01:47:59,161 --> 01:48:00,208
He's getting his ass whooped.

1608
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,508
And now he's got him in the air!

1609
01:48:04,583 --> 01:48:06,256
Oh, God.

1610
01:48:06,335 --> 01:48:08,588
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1611
01:48:12,258 --> 01:48:14,602
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1612
01:48:14,677 --> 01:48:17,021
-How much abuse can one man take?
-...continuing another round of this.

1613
01:48:17,096 --> 01:48:18,222
Go to war!

1614
01:48:22,101 --> 01:48:25,776
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1615
01:48:26,981 --> 01:48:30,110
Brendan's going for a ride!

1616
01:48:30,192 --> 01:48:32,786
That one shook the entire building!

1617
01:48:34,446 --> 01:48:36,824
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1618
01:48:36,907 --> 01:48:40,707
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1619
01:48:40,786 --> 01:48:42,504
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1620
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:45,550
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1621
01:48:45,624 --> 01:48:47,547
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1622
01:48:47,626 --> 01:48:50,300
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1623
01:48:50,379 --> 01:48:53,474
-His forearms and his hands.
-Drop that neck!

1624
01:48:53,549 --> 01:48:55,051
How much can one man take?

1625
01:48:55,968 --> 01:48:57,436
Break! Break! Break!

1626
01:48:59,722 --> 01:49:01,941
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1627
01:49:02,016 --> 01:49:04,769
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1628
01:49:04,852 --> 01:49:06,820
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1629
01:49:06,896 --> 01:49:09,069
And by the way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1630
01:49:09,148 --> 01:49:10,946
-He's lasted two rounds with Koba
-That's true, that's true.

1631
01:49:11,025 --> 01:49:13,153
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1632
01:49:14,278 --> 01:49:16,201
Sit down. Sit down.

1633
01:49:17,323 --> 01:49:18,950
Breathe. Breathe!

1634
01:49:19,658 --> 01:49:21,786
Look at me. Look at me!

1635
01:49:21,869 --> 01:49:25,169
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1636
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:30,586
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1637
01:49:30,669 --> 01:49:32,137
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1638
01:49:32,212 --> 01:49:33,464
Are we here to win this fight?

1639
01:49:33,547 --> 01:49:36,221
You tell me.
'Cause if we're not, I will throw in the towel.

1640
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:38,268
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1641
01:49:38,344 --> 01:49:40,346
We'll go home, okay?

1642
01:49:41,096 --> 01:49:43,349
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1643
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,397
Do you understand me?

1644
01:49:46,185 --> 01:49:49,234
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1645
01:49:49,688 --> 01:49:51,690
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1646
01:50:10,876 --> 01:50:13,220
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1647
01:50:17,508 --> 01:50:20,933
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1648
01:50:21,011 --> 01:50:23,434
And Koba's all over him once again.

1649
01:50:26,517 --> 01:50:27,734
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1650
01:50:27,810 --> 01:50:29,653
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1651
01:50:30,270 --> 01:50:32,068
He's starting to mix it up.

1652
01:50:40,197 --> 01:50:41,574
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1653
01:50:44,368 --> 01:50:46,746
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1654
01:50:47,538 --> 01:50:49,336
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1655
01:50:49,415 --> 01:50:52,168
-Yes!
-Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1656
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:54,128
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1657
01:50:54,211 --> 01:50:56,179
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1658
01:50:56,255 --> 01:50:57,256
trying to choke the teacher out.

1659
01:50:57,339 --> 01:51:00,183
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1660
01:51:00,259 --> 01:51:02,261
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1661
01:51:03,178 --> 01:51:04,851
Conlon looking for a way out.

1662
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:07,774
-What is this?
-Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1663
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:10,524
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1664
01:51:10,602 --> 01:51:12,821
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking for that armbar,

1665
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,445
-and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
-Hips, hips, hips!

1666
01:51:15,524 --> 01:51:16,901
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1667
01:51:17,526 --> 01:51:19,324
Koba slips right out.

1668
01:51:19,862 --> 01:51:22,786
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1669
01:51:23,115 --> 01:51:26,585
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1670
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:28,788
The teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain,

1671
01:51:28,871 --> 01:51:29,872
-but Koba's on his feet.
-Get up, get up!

1672
01:51:29,955 --> 01:51:31,457
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1673
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:33,542
and his endless bag of submissions.

1674
01:51:33,625 --> 01:51:37,050
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1675
01:51:37,129 --> 01:51:40,053
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1676
01:51:40,132 --> 01:51:42,385
We have got ourselves a fight!

1677
01:51:46,138 --> 01:51:48,391
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1678
01:51:48,474 --> 01:51:50,727
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1679
01:51:50,809 --> 01:51:52,811
He's got it very, very deep!

1680
01:51:53,145 --> 01:51:54,237
He's deep on that.

1681
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,402
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1682
01:51:56,482 --> 01:51:58,280
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1683
01:51:58,358 --> 01:52:00,076
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1684
01:52:00,402 --> 01:52:02,951
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1685
01:52:03,655 --> 01:52:05,077
Not letting out!

1686
01:52:05,157 --> 01:52:07,251
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1687
01:52:07,326 --> 01:52:09,078
He's putting everything he has into it.

1688
01:52:10,579 --> 01:52:12,923
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1689
01:52:12,998 --> 01:52:13,999
Koba taps.

1690
01:52:14,083 --> 01:52:16,506
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1691
01:52:16,585 --> 01:52:20,385
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1692
01:52:20,464 --> 01:52:23,058
He's tapped Koba!

1693
01:52:23,133 --> 01:52:25,886
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1694
01:52:25,969 --> 01:52:28,518
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1695
01:52:28,597 --> 01:52:31,817
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1696
01:52:32,476 --> 01:52:36,026
-Tess!
-You got it! You did it!

1697
01:52:36,105 --> 01:52:39,405
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1698
01:52:39,483 --> 01:52:41,110
-Babe, you did it!
-Brendan Conlon!

1699
01:52:41,193 --> 01:52:43,946
-I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
-I don't know what I just saw.

1700
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:46,202
I just don't know
how to put this into context.

1701
01:52:46,281 --> 01:52:49,125
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1702
01:52:49,201 --> 01:52:51,295
I have never seen anything like this.

1703
01:52:51,370 --> 01:52:54,840
He tapped a world Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1704
01:52:56,667 --> 01:52:59,967
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1705
01:53:00,045 --> 01:53:03,891
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1706
01:53:04,091 --> 01:53:06,139
He's done the impossible.

1707
01:53:06,218 --> 01:53:09,688
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1708
01:53:10,055 --> 01:53:13,901
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1709
01:53:25,696 --> 01:53:28,199
This is CNN Breaking News.

1710
01:53:28,907 --> 01:53:32,662
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1711
01:53:33,245 --> 01:53:36,249
CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity

1712
01:53:36,331 --> 01:53:39,175
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant
Thomas Conlon,

1713
01:53:39,251 --> 01:53:42,130
who went AWOL from his unit
earlier this year;

1714
01:53:42,212 --> 01:53:45,091
following the friendly fire death
of his brother-in-arms,

1715
01:53:45,174 --> 01:53:46,551
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1716
01:53:46,884 --> 01:53:49,763
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,
spoke with me

1717
01:53:49,845 --> 01:53:52,473
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1718
01:53:53,098 --> 01:53:55,066
The bombs started dropping.

1719
01:53:55,809 --> 01:53:58,688
They were coming from US planes.

1720
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:02,616
Tommy and Manny were waving their Hags

1721
01:54:03,567 --> 01:54:06,036
to let them know they were Americans,

1722
01:54:06,111 --> 01:54:07,738
but they didn't stop.

1723
01:54:09,281 --> 01:54:10,783
Everyone died.

1724
01:54:11,491 --> 01:54:13,414
Everyone except Tommy.

1725
01:54:14,244 --> 01:54:17,714
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1726
01:54:20,459 --> 01:54:22,962
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1727
01:54:23,629 --> 01:54:27,600
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1728
01:54:27,674 --> 01:54:31,053
is expected to be taken into custody
by military police,

1729
01:54:31,136 --> 01:54:34,265
following tonight's winner-take-all finale
in Atlantic City.

1730
01:54:34,348 --> 01:54:38,728
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1731
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:40,687
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1732
01:54:42,397 --> 01:54:44,399
We've just got some incredible news,

1733
01:54:44,483 --> 01:54:47,157
that I'm having trouble
putting into context, but here it is.

1734
01:54:47,486 --> 01:54:51,411
The two men
fighting for the championship tonight,

1735
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:53,663
for the $5 million prize,

1736
01:54:53,784 --> 01:54:57,254
for the middleweight championship
of the world,

1737
01:54:57,329 --> 01:54:58,831
are brothers.

1738
01:55:25,023 --> 01:55:27,276
All right, let's get this off.

1739
01:55:44,501 --> 01:55:46,378
What are you gonna do?

1740
01:55:51,258 --> 01:55:53,010
I'm gonna fight him.

1741
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:07,300
-Mr. C, Mr. C!
-Mr. C, Mr. C!

1742
01:57:53,046 --> 01:57:56,220
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1743
01:58:54,566 --> 01:58:55,909
Gentlemen.

1744
01:59:02,741 --> 01:59:05,164
Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1745
01:59:05,243 --> 01:59:08,338
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1746
01:59:08,413 --> 01:59:10,211
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1747
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:11,712
Where's Pop?

1748
01:59:32,103 --> 01:59:34,105
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1749
01:59:35,357 --> 01:59:36,779
Are you ready?

1750
01:59:38,109 --> 01:59:39,281
Let's go to war!

1751
01:59:51,331 --> 01:59:53,299
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1752
01:59:57,337 --> 01:59:58,964
Get out! Get out of there!

1753
02:00:00,465 --> 02:00:02,138
Throw your hands!

1754
02:00:03,426 --> 02:00:05,394
Throw your hands!

1755
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:07,564
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1756
02:00:07,639 --> 02:00:09,141
Move! Move!

1757
02:00:11,309 --> 02:00:14,483
Tie him up! Tie him up!
Control his moves. Control his moves.

1758
02:00:14,896 --> 02:00:17,365
Control the arms!
Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1759
02:00:17,899 --> 02:00:20,823
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1760
02:00:26,658 --> 02:00:28,831
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1761
02:00:28,910 --> 02:00:30,833
Relax! Breathe!

1762
02:00:31,162 --> 02:00:34,086
Tie him up! Get up!
Tie him up, Brendan! Tie him up!

1763
02:00:34,791 --> 02:00:36,168
Come on. Get him! Get him! Get him!

1764
02:00:37,168 --> 02:00:38,511
Break!

1765
02:00:38,753 --> 02:00:40,005
What was that?

1766
02:00:40,088 --> 02:00:41,510
Hey, come on, Josh!

1767
02:00:41,756 --> 02:00:42,848
What's up with that?

1768
02:00:43,174 --> 02:00:44,926
Hey, step back!

1769
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:46,557
Watch that late blow!

1770
02:00:47,262 --> 02:00:48,514
Come on!

1771
02:00:56,688 --> 02:00:58,611
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1772
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,863
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1773
02:01:00,942 --> 02:01:02,740
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1774
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:04,913
Look at me. Sit down.

1775
02:01:05,530 --> 02:01:07,703
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1776
02:01:08,908 --> 02:01:13,288
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1777
02:01:13,371 --> 02:01:15,920
Breathe. Beethoven.

1778
02:01:16,541 --> 02:01:19,920
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1779
02:01:20,003 --> 02:01:23,132
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1780
02:01:23,214 --> 02:01:24,511
-Angle out and move.
-Good.

1781
02:01:24,591 --> 02:01:27,060
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

1782
02:01:29,137 --> 02:01:31,981
-Okay. He's not your brother, right?
-Time's up!

1783
02:01:32,057 --> 02:01:33,900
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

1784
02:01:33,975 --> 02:01:35,067
-All right.
-He's in the way.

1785
02:01:35,185 --> 02:01:37,529
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1786
02:01:37,604 --> 02:01:40,027
Taking a little more time for the cheap shot.

1787
02:01:42,567 --> 02:01:44,410
Do your job, Josh.

1788
02:01:49,532 --> 02:01:50,909
Come on, babe. Come on.

1789
02:01:51,076 --> 02:01:52,669
Let's go to war.

1790
02:01:52,744 --> 02:01:53,745
Breathe!

1791
02:01:58,917 --> 02:02:01,136
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1792
02:02:11,429 --> 02:02:12,430
Cover up!

1793
02:02:13,348 --> 02:02:15,692
Come on, get off the fence!

1794
02:02:15,767 --> 02:02:16,939
Get off the fence!

1795
02:02:17,769 --> 02:02:18,986
Hands up! Hands up!

1796
02:02:20,438 --> 02:02:23,362
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

1797
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:26,452
Yeah!

1798
02:02:32,951 --> 02:02:33,952
Get him!

1799
02:02:36,955 --> 02:02:40,004
-Huge throw. Huge.
-Look at that.

1800
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:41,710
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

1801
02:02:41,793 --> 02:02:43,466
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1802
02:02:46,589 --> 02:02:48,717
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

1803
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,682
Control the arms! Control the arms!

1804
02:02:54,055 --> 02:02:56,604
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1805
02:02:58,309 --> 02:02:59,811
Break free! Break! Break!

1806
02:03:01,563 --> 02:03:04,442
Good, good, good!
Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

1807
02:03:04,524 --> 02:03:06,151
-Come on.
-Here we go, mom.

1808
02:03:06,234 --> 02:03:09,784
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1809
02:03:15,744 --> 02:03:16,836
Let's go to war!

1810
02:03:34,804 --> 02:03:36,727
Now! Get up! Get up!

1811
02:03:37,724 --> 02:03:39,271
Get up! Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1812
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:41,193
Control it! Control it with the arms.

1813
02:03:41,269 --> 02:03:42,816
Switch! Switch!

1814
02:03:44,939 --> 02:03:46,282
Hips!

1815
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,568
Down, down. Hips down.

1816
02:03:52,363 --> 02:03:55,617
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1817
02:03:57,035 --> 02:03:58,708
Come on, Tommy!

1818
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,798
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1819
02:04:06,544 --> 02:04:07,670
Tom!

1820
02:04:15,178 --> 02:04:16,430
Break! Break! Break!

1821
02:04:16,513 --> 02:04:19,062
Tommy, you okay?

1822
02:04:23,561 --> 02:04:26,064
-Tommy!
-Go! Let's go! Go!

1823
02:04:26,147 --> 02:04:27,569
Calm down. Calm down.

1824
02:04:28,608 --> 02:04:31,157
-It's the championship. Keep it together.
-All right. All right. I got it.

1825
02:04:31,236 --> 02:04:32,738
Sit down. Sit down!

1826
02:04:40,203 --> 02:04:42,001
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1827
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:45,300
-I popped his shoulder.
-Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1828
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:47,002
-I heard it tear.
-You popped his shoulder?

1829
02:04:47,085 --> 02:04:48,132
-Yeah.
-Good. Okay.

1830
02:04:48,211 --> 02:04:50,839
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1831
02:04:50,922 --> 02:04:52,799
-Josh.
-Hey, hey, no Josh.

1832
02:04:52,882 --> 02:04:54,008
-Josh.
-Hey!

1833
02:04:54,092 --> 02:04:55,514
-Look at me. Look at me.
-What?

1834
02:04:55,593 --> 02:04:57,391
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1835
02:04:57,470 --> 02:04:58,767
We need both rounds.

1836
02:05:01,516 --> 02:05:02,608
What?

1837
02:05:02,684 --> 02:05:05,779
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1838
02:05:12,318 --> 02:05:15,447
Go in there, you kick him in the head,
take him down and finish him!

1839
02:05:23,037 --> 02:05:25,415
Tommy, what are you doing?

1840
02:05:26,165 --> 02:05:27,792
Shut up. Come on.

1841
02:05:28,751 --> 02:05:30,219
Stand back.

1842
02:05:30,962 --> 02:05:34,091
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1843
02:05:35,592 --> 02:05:37,265
Let's go to war!

1844
02:05:38,636 --> 02:05:40,980
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1845
02:05:41,681 --> 02:05:42,933
It's over.

1846
02:05:44,142 --> 02:05:46,816
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1847
02:05:48,313 --> 02:05:49,986
It's over, Tommy.

1848
02:05:50,231 --> 02:05:51,232
You better fight!

1849
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:04,254
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1850
02:06:08,374 --> 02:06:10,752
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1851
02:06:22,555 --> 02:06:25,149
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1852
02:06:25,475 --> 02:06:26,818
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1853
02:06:34,484 --> 02:06:36,737
Okay? You all right there?

1854
02:06:37,528 --> 02:06:38,871
Tommy!

1855
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:51,793
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1856
02:06:58,466 --> 02:06:59,843
Come on.

1857
02:07:10,603 --> 02:07:13,573
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

1858
02:09:11,099 --> 02:09:14,694
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

1859
02:09:17,897 --> 02:09:19,865
Tap, Tommy.

1860
02:09:20,525 --> 02:09:22,994
It's okay. It's okay.

1861
02:09:32,954 --> 02:09:34,501
I love you.

1862
02:09:35,706 --> 02:09:37,208
I love you, Tommy.
