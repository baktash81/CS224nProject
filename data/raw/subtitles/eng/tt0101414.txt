1
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:50,494
Once upon a time
in a faraway land

2
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,296
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

3
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,962
Although he had
everything his heart desired

4
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:03,067
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:05,509
But then, one winter's night

6
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,844
an old beggar woman
came to the castle

7
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,475
and offered him a single rose

8
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:15,248
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

9
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:17,915
Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

10
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:22,826
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

11
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:26,992
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

12
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,126
for beauty is found within

13
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,728
and when he dismissed her again

14
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:34,740
the old woman's ugliness
melted away

15
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:37,504
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

16
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:41,070
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

17
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:44,777
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

18
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:47,513
and as punishment,
she transformed him

19
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,145
into a hideous beast

20
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,453
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

21
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,426
and all who lived there.

22
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,860
Ashamed of his monstrous form

23
00:01:56,896 --> 00:02:00,423
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

24
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,526
with a magic mirror
as his only window

25
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,230
to the outside world.

26
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:10,402
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

27
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:14,174
which would bloom
until his 21st year.

28
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:17,046
lf he could learn
to love another

29
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:22,248
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

30
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:25,348
then the spell would be broken.

31
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:30,852
lf not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

32
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:37,097
As the years passed,
he fell into despair

33
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:40,196
and lost all hope

34
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,437
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

35
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:16,641
Little town,
it's a quiet village

36
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:21,443
Every day lile the one before

37
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:25,941
Little town,
full of little people

38
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:31,582
Waking up... to... say...

39
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:32,488
Bonjour!

40
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:33,389
- Bonjour!

41
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,393
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

42
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:35,018
Bonjour!

43
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,688
There goes the baker

44
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,596
With his tray like always

45
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,829
The same old bread
and rolls to sell

46
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:44,700
Every morning just the same

47
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,261
Since the morning that we came

48
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,000
To this poor provincial town...

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,029
Good morning, Belle.

50
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,042
Good morning, Monsieur.

51
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,065
Where are you off to?

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,042
The bookshop.

53
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,273
l just finished
the most wonderful story

54
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,211
about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...

55
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,375
That's nice.

56
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,679
Marie! The baguettes.

57
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,242
Hurry up!

58
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:01,253
Look, there she goes

59
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,755
The girl is strange, no question

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,226
Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell?

61
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:09,022
Never part of any crowd

62
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,926
'Cause her head's
up on some cloud

63
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:14,899
No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle

64
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,094
Bonjour

65
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:17,102
Good day

66
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:18,865
How is your family?

67
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:19,872
Bonjour

68
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:20,895
Good day

69
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,805
How is your wife?

70
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:24,699
l need six eggs

71
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,204
That's too expensive

72
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,505
There must be more
than this provincial life...

73
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:32,033
Ah, Belle.

74
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,067
Good morning.

75
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:34,944
l've come to return
the book l borrowed.

76
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:35,948
Finished already?

77
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:37,279
Oh, l couldn't put it down.

78
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,283
Have you got anything new?

79
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,443
Not since yesterday.

80
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,852
That's all right.

81
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,913
l'll borrow... this one.

82
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:45,015
That one?

83
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,457
But you've read it twice.

84
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:48,723
Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places

85
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,126
daring sword fights

86
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:51,994
magic spells,
a prince in disguise.

87
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:55,228
lf you like it
all that much, it's yours.

88
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:57,293
-But, sir...
-l insist.

89
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,302
Well, thank you.

90
00:04:58,404 --> 00:04:59,598
Thank you very much.

91
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,197
Look, there she goes

92
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,801
That girl is so peculiar

93
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:07,142
l wonder if she's feeling well

94
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,943
With a dreamy, far-off look

95
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,711
And her nose stuck in a book

96
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,846
What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle

97
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:20,849
Oh, isn't this amazing?

98
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:30,269
lt's my favorite part
because you'll see

99
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,468
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming

100
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:40,240
But she won't discover
that it's him

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,681
Till Chapter Three

102
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,707
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:49,279
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

104
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:52,518
Her looks have got no parallel

105
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,424
But behind that fair facade

106
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,553
l'm afraid she's rather odd

107
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,530
Very different
from the rest of us

108
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,396
She's nothing like
the rest of us

109
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:04,301
Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle

110
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,066
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

111
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,168
You're the greatest hunter

112
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:13,406
in the whole world.

113
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,073
l know.

114
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:17,082
No beast alive
stands a chance against you

115
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:19,050
and no girl, for that matter.

116
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:20,052
lt's true, Lefou

117
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,486
and l've got my sights set
on that one.

118
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,251
The inventor's daughter?

119
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:27,087
She's the one-- the lucky girl
l'm going to marry.

120
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,184
But, she...

121
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:29,525
The most beautiful girl in town.

122
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,688
l know, but...

123
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,493
That makes her the best

124
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,220
and don't l deserve the best?

125
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,284
Well, of course.

126
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,522
l mean, you do, but...

127
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,794
Right from the moment
when l met her, saw her

128
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:39,926
l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell

129
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:43,726
l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell

130
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:47,757
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me

131
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:51,828
So, l'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

132
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:55,808
Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy?

133
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:58,936
Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute

134
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,608
Be still, my heart,
l'm hardly breathing

135
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,141
He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute

136
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:08,450
-Bonjour -Pardon
-Good day -Mais oui

137
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:10,422
-You call this bacon?
-What lovely grapes

138
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,220
-Ten yards -Some cheese
-'Scuse me -One pound

139
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,226
l'll get the knife

140
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,192
Please let me through

141
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,285
-This bread -Those fish

142
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:16,295
-lt's stale -They smell

143
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,296
Madame's mistaken

144
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,558
There must be more

145
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:21,195
Than this provincial life

146
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:24,926
Just watch, l'm going
to make Belle my wife

147
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:25,932
Look, there she goes

148
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,628
A girl who's strange
but special

149
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:31,968
A most peculiar mademoiselle

150
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:33,530
lt's a pity and a sin

151
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:35,337
She doesn't quite fit in

152
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,137
'Cause she really is
a funny girl

153
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:39,475
A beauty but a funny girl

154
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:44,507
She really is a funny girl

155
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,679
That Belle...

156
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,690
Bonjour, bonjour.

157
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,117
Hello, Belle.

158
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:56,852
Bonjour, Gaston.

159
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:59,019
Gaston,
may l have my book, please?

160
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,187
How can you read this?

161
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:01,320
There's no pictures.

162
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:03,422
Well, some people
use their imagination.

163
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:05,524
Belle, it's about time
you got your head

164
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,556
out of those books

165
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:09,332
and paid attention
to more important things...

166
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,393
like me.

167
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,875
The whole town's
talking about it.

168
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,935
lt's not right
for a woman to read.

169
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,743
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

170
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,305
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

171
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,510
Why, thank you, Belle.

172
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,611
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

173
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:27,349
and take a look at my trophies?

174
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,152
Maybe some other time.

175
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,317
What's wrong with her?

176
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,348
She's crazy.

177
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:32,917
He's gorgeous.

178
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:34,360
Please, Gaston, l can't.

179
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:36,557
l have to get home
to help my father.

180
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:37,565
Good-bye.

181
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,123
That crazy old loon--

182
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,567
he needs all the
help he can get.

183
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:44,197
Don't talk about my father
that way.

184
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,934
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

185
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,374
My father is not crazy.

186
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,399
He's a genius.

187
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,476
Ooh!

188
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,453
Papa?

189
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:06,959
How on earth did that happen?

190
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,461
Doggone it!

191
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:10,326
Are you all right, Papa?

192
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:14,130
l'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

193
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:15,965
You always say that.

194
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:17,163
l mean it this time.

195
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,136
l'll never get

196
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:20,504
this boneheaded contraption
to work!

197
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,667
Yes, you will

198
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,041
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

199
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:25,010
Humph!

200
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,980
And become
a world-famous inventor.

201
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,983
You really believe that?

202
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,541
l always have.

203
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,678
Well, what are we waiting for?

204
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,349
l'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

205
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,789
Hand me that, uh...

206
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,588
dog-legged clincher, there.

207
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,357
So, did you have a
good time in town today?

208
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,522
l got a new book.

209
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:48,001
Papa, do you think l'm odd?

210
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:49,290
My daughter? Odd?

211
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,231
Where would you get
an idea like that?

212
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,358
Oh, l don't know.

213
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:56,268
lt's just that l'm not sure
l fit in here.

214
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,738
There's no one
l can really talk to.

215
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,536
What about that Gaston?

216
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,303
He's a handsome fellow.

217
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:06,109
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

218
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,910
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

219
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,347
Well, don't you worry

220
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:12,352
'cause this invention's
going to be the start

221
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:13,785
of a new life for us.

222
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,345
l think that's done it.

223
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,118
Now, let's give it a try.

224
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,802
lt works!

225
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,138
lt does?

226
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,336
lt does!

227
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:37,344
You did it!

228
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:38,640
You really did it!

229
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,408
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

230
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,211
l'm off to the fair!

231
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:45,446
Good-bye, Papa.

232
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,884
Good luck.

233
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,049
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while l'm gone.

234
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:08,943
We should be there by now.

235
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:09,910
We should be there by now.

236
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:12,208
Maybe we've missed the turn.

237
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,146
l guess l should have taken...

238
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:15,614
Wait a minute.

239
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:22,017
Let's go this way.

240
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,768
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

241
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,292
We'll be there in no time.

242
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,647
This can't be right.

243
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,386
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

244
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:02,190
We'd better turn around.

245
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,130
Whoa...

246
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:07,565
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

247
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:10,563
Oh...!

248
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,199
Oh, look out!

249
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,790
Whoa!

250
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,799
Whoa, boy!

251
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,666
Back up, back up, back up!

252
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:24,762
Good boy, good boy.

253
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:25,829
That's it.

254
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:26,897
Back up!

255
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,567
Steady, steady.

256
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,940
Now, steady.

257
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,944
Philippe, no!

258
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,285
Philippe.

259
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:45,921
Oh...

260
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:08,982
Help!

261
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,317
ls someone there?!

262
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,825
Oh!

263
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,312
What...?

264
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:44,373
Oh...

265
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:50,080
Hello?

266
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:53,716
Hello?

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,127
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

268
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:59,393
Keep quiet; maybe he'll go away.

269
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:01,696
ls someone there?

270
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:05,431
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

271
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:09,406
l don't mean to intrude,
but l've lost my horse

272
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:12,809
and l need a place to stay
for the night.

273
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,836
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

274
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,542
Shh!

275
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,247
Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

276
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,845
Who said that?

277
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,857
Over here.

278
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:26,119
Where?

279
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,023
Allo.

280
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:32,292
lncredible.

281
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:35,028
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

282
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,127
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

283
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,603
How is this accomplished?

284
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:39,832
Put me down at once!

285
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,066
Stop that!

286
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:45,244
Stop that, l say.

287
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:46,233
Ow!

288
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:51,344
Huh... Close that at once.

289
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,851
Do you mind?!

290
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,250
l-l beg your pardon.

291
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,256
lt's, it's just
that l've never seen a...

292
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,426
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.

293
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,627
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

294
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,637
Thank you.

295
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:12,729
No, no, no.

296
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:16,264
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

297
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:20,040
l demand
that you stop right there.

298
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,247
Oh, no, no!

299
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,248
Not the master's chair.

300
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,110
l'm not seeing this!

301
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,380
l am not seeing this!

302
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,948
Well, hello there, boy.

303
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,422
What service.

304
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:40,227
All right,
this has gone far enough.

305
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,790
l'm in charge here.

306
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,132
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

307
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,762
lt'll warm you up
in no time.

308
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,773
No. No tea.

309
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:49,104
No tea!

310
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:53,367
His mustache tickles, Mama.

311
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,380
Oh!

312
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,642
Hello.

313
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:03,548
Uh-oh.

314
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,648
Oh...

315
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:12,327
Ah...

316
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,333
There's a stranger here.

317
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,891
Master, allow me to explain.

318
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,869
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

319
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,165
He was cold and wet...

320
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:23,641
Master, l'd like
to take this moment to say

321
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,610
l was against this
from the start.

322
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:26,872
lt was all his fault.

323
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:30,075
l tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

324
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:37,146
Who are you?

325
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,417
What are you doing here?

326
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,925
l-l-l was lost in the woods,
and, and...

327
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,892
You're not welcome here!

328
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,021
l-l-l'm sorry.

329
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,190
What are you staring at?!

330
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:47,256
N-Nothing.

331
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,996
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?!

332
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:52,333
Please, l meant no harm!

333
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,236
l just needed a place to stay.

334
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,173
l'll give you a place to stay.

335
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,334
Oh, no...!

336
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:59,435
Please! Oh, no!

337
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:07,242
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

338
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,646
huh, Gaston?

339
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,344
Yep. This is her lucky day.

340
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,782
l'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

341
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:21,386
But first l'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

342
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:26,728
And you, Lefou-- now, when Belle
and l come out that door...

343
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:27,699
Oh, l know, l know!

344
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,134
l-l strike up the band.

345
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:33,732
Not yet!

346
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,401
Sorry.

347
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:48,051
Gaston.

348
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:49,851
What a pleasant surprise.

349
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,152
lsn't it, though?

350
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:53,318
l'm just full of surprises.

351
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,487
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

352
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,497
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

353
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:59,692
This is the day...

354
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,223
Hmm.

355
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:02,462
Yeah.

356
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:03,437
This is the day your
dreams come true.

357
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:04,699
This is the day your
dreams come true.

358
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:08,037
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

359
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:11,567
Plenty. Here, picture this:

360
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,671
A rustic hunting lodge

361
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:16,808
my latest kill
roasting on the fire

362
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,944
and my little wife,
massaging my feet

363
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:23,081
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.

364
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:24,283
We'll have six or seven.

365
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:25,188
Dogs?

366
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,192
No, Belle!

367
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:27,420
Strapping boys, like me.

368
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:28,428
lmagine that.

369
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:29,429
And do you know

370
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,021
who that little wife will be?

371
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,031
Let me think.

372
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,089
You, Belle.

373
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,259
Gaston, l'm...

374
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,598
l'm...

375
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:36,933
speechless.

376
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,461
l really don't know what to say.

377
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:40,473
Say you'll marry me.

378
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,669
l'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

379
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,042
but... l just don't deserve you.

380
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,808
Whoa!

381
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:04,395
So, how'd it go?

382
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:07,764
l'll have Belle for my wife.

383
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,565
Make no mistake about that!

384
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:12,663
Touchy.

385
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:22,410
ls he gone?

386
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,948
Can you imagine?

387
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,850
He asked me to marry him.

388
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:30,379
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

389
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:33,154
Madame Gaston

390
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,820
Can't you just see it?

391
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:36,294
Madame Gaston

392
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,855
His little wife

393
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:41,459
No, sir, not me

394
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:42,865
l guarantee it

395
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:46,540
l want much more
than this provincial life

396
00:19:55,649 --> 00:20:00,643
l want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere

397
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:04,350
l want it more than l can tell

398
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:09,192
And for once it might be grand

399
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:12,687
To have someone understand

400
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:19,866
l want so much more
than they've got planned.

401
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:24,504
Philippe!
What are you doing here?

402
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:25,977
Where's...?

403
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:27,138
Where's Papa?

404
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,511
Where is he, Philippe?

405
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:29,775
What happened?

406
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,215
Oh, we have to find him.

407
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,981
You have to take me to him.

408
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:48,434
What is this place?

409
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:51,404
Philippe, please!

410
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:52,496
Steady!

411
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,402
Steady.

412
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:00,775
Papa.

413
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:03,715
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

414
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,048
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

415
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,610
Serve him tea.

416
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:09,212
Sit in the master's chair.

417
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:10,620
Pet the pooch.

418
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,488
l was trying
to be hospitable.

419
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,119
Hello?

420
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,994
ls anyone here?

421
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:21,762
Hello? Papa?

422
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,928
Papa?

423
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,097
Are you here?

424
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:29,108
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

425
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:32,509
Now, Chip, l'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

426
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,035
Really, Mama. l saw her.

427
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,012
Not another word.

428
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,015
But...

429
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,016
lnto the tub.

430
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,017
Woop...

431
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,019
Well! l saw a girl
in the castle!

432
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:42,715
See? l told you.

433
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:46,692
lrresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

434
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:47,852
Papa?

435
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:50,594
Did you see that?

436
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,531
lt's a girl!

437
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:55,863
l know it's a girl.

438
00:21:55,902 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't you see?

439
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:57,996
She's the one--

440
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,698
the girl we have
been waiting for.

441
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,138
She has come to break the spell!

442
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:02,505
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

443
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:07,702
Papa?

444
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,346
Papa?

445
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:13,412
Hello?

446
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:15,387
ls someone here?

447
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,752
Wait!

448
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,781
l'm looking for my father. l...

449
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,421
That's funny.

450
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:26,421
l'm sure there was someone.

451
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:27,933
l-ls anyone here?

452
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,264
Belle?

453
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:31,270
Papa!

454
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:33,867
H-How did you find me?

455
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:35,499
Oh, your hands are like ice.

456
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:37,439
l have to get you out of there.

457
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:39,707
Belle, l want you
to leave this place.

458
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:40,838
Who's done this to you?

459
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,245
No time to explain.

460
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:43,271
You must go! Now!

461
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:44,340
l won't leave you!

462
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:45,874
What are you doing here?

463
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,851
Run, Belle!

464
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:48,513
Who's there?
Who are you?

465
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:50,352
The master of this castle.

466
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:52,887
l've come for my father.

467
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,359
Please let him out.

468
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:55,622
Can't you see he's sick?

469
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:57,755
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

470
00:22:57,797 --> 00:22:59,355
But he could die.

471
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:00,696
Please, l-l'll do anything.

472
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:03,327
There's nothing you can do.

473
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,461
He's my prisoner.

474
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,039
Oh, there must be
some way l can...

475
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:08,165
Wait!

476
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,475
Take me instead.

477
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:18,312
You?!

478
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,319
You would...

479
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:21,786
take his place?

480
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,810
Belle, no!

481
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,824
You don't know
what you're doing!

482
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:27,053
lf l did,
would you let him go?

483
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:31,689
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

484
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,534
Come into the light.

485
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,506
No, Belle!

486
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:51,709
l won't let you do this!

487
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:54,345
You have my word.

488
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:56,378
Done!

489
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:01,325
No, Belle, listen to me.

490
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,953
l'm old. l've lived my life.

491
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,020
Wait.

492
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:04,722
Belle!

493
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:05,458
Wait!

494
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:08,194
No, please spare my daughter.

495
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:09,360
Please!

496
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:11,870
She's no longer your concern.

497
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:13,304
Take him to the village.

498
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:14,306
Let me out!

499
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,602
Please let me out!

500
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:17,405
Let me out!

501
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:20,173
Please! Oh, please!

502
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:26,375
Master?

503
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:27,408
What?

504
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,887
Since the girl is going
to be with us

505
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,220
for quite some time

506
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:34,317
l was thinking that you
might want to offer her

507
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,021
a more comfortable room.

508
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,493
Then again, maybe not.

509
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:45,003
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

510
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,063
l'll never see him again.

511
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:50,234
l didn't get to say good-bye.

512
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:52,073
l'll show you to your room.

513
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:53,510
My room?

514
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:54,979
But l thought...

515
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:57,073
You want to stay in the tower?

516
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:57,844
No.

517
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:59,044
Then follow me.

518
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,871
Say something to her.

519
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:23,933
Huh? Oh.

520
00:25:23,977 --> 00:25:27,504
l, uh, hope you like it here.

521
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:32,643
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

522
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:34,016
except the west wing.

523
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:34,883
What's in the west...?

524
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:36,855
lt's forbidden!

525
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:45,063
Now, if you need anything

526
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:47,123
my servants will attend you.

527
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,599
Dinner.
lnvite her to dinner.

528
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,432
You will join me for dinner.

529
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:53,632
That's not a request!

530
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,453
Who does she think she is?

531
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,460
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

532
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,463
No one says no to Gaston.

533
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,555
Darn right.

534
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,828
Dismissed, rejected...

535
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,391
publicly humiliated.

536
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:25,802
Why, it's more than l can bear.

537
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:26,862
More beer?

538
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:27,838
What for?

539
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:29,170
Nothing helps.

540
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,470
l'm disgraced.

541
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:31,736
Who, you?

542
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:32,573
Never!

543
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,015
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

544
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,916
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

545
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,852
Looking so down in the dumps

546
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:46,482
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

547
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,858
Even when taking your lumps

548
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:52,796
There's no man in town
as admired as you

549
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:56,598
You're everyone's favorite guy

550
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,530
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you

551
00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:06,569
And it's not very hard
to see why

552
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:11,473
No... one's...

553
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:12,872
Slick as Gaston

554
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,844
No one's quick as Gaston

555
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:18,178
No one's neck's
as incredibly thick as Gaston

556
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:21,946
For there's no man in town
half as manly

557
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:24,477
Perfect, a pure paragon

558
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,958
You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley

559
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:29,482
And they'll tell you whose team

560
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:32,153
They prefer to be on

561
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,220
Ooh!

562
00:27:33,264 --> 00:27:37,462
No... one's...
been like Gaston

563
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:39,128
A kingpin like Gaston

564
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,137
No one's got a full cleft

565
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:42,695
ln his chin like Gaston

566
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,506
As a specimen, yes,
l'm intimidating

567
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:49,672
My, what a guy, that Gaston

568
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,203
Give five ''hurrahs!''

569
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,049
Give 12 ''hip-hips!''

570
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:57,882
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

571
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:01,448
No... one...

572
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:02,890
Fights like Gaston

573
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,655
Douses lights like Gaston

574
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:07,959
ln a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston

575
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:11,229
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

576
00:28:11,268 --> 00:28:14,635
As you see,
l've got biceps to spare

577
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:17,162
Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny

578
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,572
That's right

579
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:21,839
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair

580
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:23,209
No one hits like Gaston

581
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,679
Matches wits like Gaston

582
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:28,844
ln a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston

583
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:31,217
l'm especially good
at expectorating

584
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:32,186
Ptooey!

585
00:28:32,222 --> 00:28:35,214
Ten points for Gaston!

586
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:36,657
When l was a lad

587
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:38,661
l ate four dozen eggs

588
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:41,789
Every morning
to help me get large

589
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:43,196
And now that l'm grown

590
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:44,996
l eat five dozen eggs

591
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:50,974
So l'm roughly
the size of a barge

592
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:54,272
No... one...

593
00:28:54,311 --> 00:28:55,778
Shoots like Gaston

594
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:57,775
Makes those beauts like Gaston

595
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:00,680
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

596
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:04,914
l use antlers
in all of my decorating

597
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:07,320
My, what a guy

598
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:12,692
Gaston!

599
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:17,632
Help!

600
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:18,564
Help!

601
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,464
Someone help me!

602
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:20,466
Maurice?

603
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:21,000
Please, please!

604
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:22,263
l need your help.

605
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,429
He's got her...

606
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,132
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

607
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:26,140
Who?

608
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,141
Belle. We must go.

609
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:29,166
N-Not a minute to lose.

610
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,268
Whoa!

611
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,573
Slow down, Maurice.

612
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,604
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

613
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,945
A beast!

614
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,645
A horrible, monstrous beast.

615
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:43,417
ls it a big beast?

616
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,447
Huge!

617
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,959
With a long ugly snout?

618
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,120
Hideously ugly.

619
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,788
And sharp, cruel fangs?

620
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,888
Yes, yes.

621
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,398
Will you help me?

622
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:52,490
All right, old man.

623
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,862
We'll help you out.

624
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:54,868
You will?

625
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:55,836
Oh, thank you.

626
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:57,802
Thank you.
Thank you!

627
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,005
Oh!

628
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,802
Oh!

629
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,900
Crazy old Maurice.

630
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:05,002
He's always good for a laugh.

631
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,072
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

632
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:13,075
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

633
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,181
Lefou, l'm afraid
l've been thinking

634
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:18,521
A dangerous pastime...

635
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:20,526
l know

636
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:23,188
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

637
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,994
And his sanity's only so-so

638
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:30,163
Now the wheels in my head
have been turning

639
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,968
Since l looked
at that loony old man

640
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,875
See, l promised myself

641
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:37,069
l'd be married to Belle

642
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,069
And right now,
l'm evolving a plan

643
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:43,139
lf l...

644
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:44,150
Yes?

645
00:30:44,184 --> 00:30:45,208
Then we...

646
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:46,241
No! Would she...?

647
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:47,218
Guess!

648
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:48,312
Now l get it!

649
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:50,152
Let's go!

650
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,182
No... one...

651
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,854
Plots like Gaston

652
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,760
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

653
00:30:56,797 --> 00:30:59,823
Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston

654
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:05,361
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

655
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,930
My, what a guy!

656
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:12,139
Gaston!

657
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:18,717
Will no one help me?

658
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,053
Who is it?

659
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,460
Mrs. Potts, dear.

660
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,525
l thought you might
like a spot of tea.

661
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,535
But you're... you're a...

662
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,864
Ooh!

663
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:37,870
Careful.

664
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:38,836
This is impossible.

665
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:40,362
l know it is.

666
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,238
But here we are.

667
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,972
l told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't l?

668
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:47,378
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

669
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:48,438
Slowly now.

670
00:31:48,482 --> 00:31:50,006
Don't spill.

671
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,677
Thank you.

672
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:54,243
Want to see me do a trick?

673
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,649
Chip!

674
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,749
Oops. Sorry.

675
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,352
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

676
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:03,090
We all think so.

677
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,622
But l've lost my father,
my dreams... everything.

678
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,191
Cheer up, child.

679
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:11,671
lt'll turn out
all right in the end.

680
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:12,933
You'll see.

681
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,133
Oh, listen to me.

682
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:15,607
Jabbering on while
there's a supper

683
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,666
to get on the table.

684
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,678
Chip!

685
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:20,009
Bye.

686
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:22,675
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

687
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:25,207
Oh, let's see what l got
in my drawers.

688
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:27,812
Ooh! How embarrassing.

689
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,617
Ah, here we are.

690
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,456
You'll look ravishing
in this one.

691
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,520
That's very kind of you, but...
l'm not going to dinner.

692
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,318
Oh, but you must.

693
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:45,698
Dinner is served.

694
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:49,429
What's taking so long?

695
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,369
l told her to come down.

696
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:52,666
Why isn't she here yet?

697
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,468
Oh, try to be patient, sir.

698
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:58,500
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom, all in one day.

699
00:32:58,544 --> 00:32:59,841
Master, have you thought

700
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:02,871
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

701
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:04,348
Of course l have.

702
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:05,715
l'm not a fool.

703
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,083
Good!

704
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,884
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

705
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:12,220
and poof! the spell is broken.

706
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,226
We'll be human again
by midnight.

707
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,023
Ooh, it's not that easy,
Lumiere.

708
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:17,359
These things take time.

709
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,456
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

710
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,490
Oh, it's no use.

711
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:24,298
She's so beautiful, and l'm...

712
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,429
Well, look at me!

713
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,667
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

714
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,074
l don't know how.

715
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,476
Well, you can start

716
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,105
by making yourself
more presentable.

717
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,341
Straighten up.

718
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,077
Try to act like a gentleman.

719
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,550
Ah, yes.
When she comes in

720
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,553
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

721
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,316
Come, come,
show me the smile.

722
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,285
But don't frighten
the poor girl.

723
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,054
lmpress her
with your rapier wit.

724
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:50,028
But be gentle.

725
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,552
Shower her
with compliments.

726
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,564
But be sincere.

727
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:53,564
And above all...

728
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:56,568
You must control your temper!

729
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:58,436
Here she is!

730
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,365
Good evening.

731
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,442
Well, where is she?

732
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:06,601
Who? Oh.

733
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,043
The girl, yes.

734
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,307
The... girl.

735
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,510
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

736
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:16,212
Circumstances being
what they are...

737
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,778
She's not coming.

738
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,983
What?!

739
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,389
But, Your Grace...!

740
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,655
Your Eminence!

741
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:30,133
l thought l told you
to come down to dinner!

742
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,498
l'm not hungry.

743
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:33,503
You come out, or l'll...

744
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:35,334
l'll... l'll break down
the door!

745
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,533
Master...

746
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,099
l could be wrong,
but that may not be

747
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,078
the best way
to win the girl's affections.

748
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,640
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

749
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,516
But she is being so difficult.

750
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,144
Gently, gently.

751
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,889
Will you come down to dinner?

752
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,118
No.

753
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,421
Hmm?

754
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,552
Ah, ah, ah!

755
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,857
Suave, genteel.

756
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:05,062
lt would give me great pleasure
if you would join me for dinner.

757
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,262
We say please.

758
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,862
Please.

759
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:08,701
No, thank you!

760
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,263
You can't stay in there forever!

761
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,639
Yes, l can.

762
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,373
Fine. Then go ahead and starve!

763
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:20,214
lf she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all.

764
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,721
Oh, dear.

765
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,356
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

766
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,254
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

767
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,193
and inform me at once

768
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:32,957
if there is
the slightest change.

769
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,896
You can count on me,
mon capitan.

770
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,366
Well, we might as well
go downstairs

771
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,393
and start cleaning up.

772
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:44,066
l ask nicely,
but she refuses.

773
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,837
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

774
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:49,041
Show me the girl.

775
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,840
Well, the master's
really not so bad

776
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,317
once you get to know him.

777
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,217
Why don't you give him a chance?

778
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:58,881
l don't want to get to know him.

779
00:35:58,922 --> 00:35:59,917
l don't want to have anything
to do with him!

780
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:01,748
l don't want to have anything
to do with him!

781
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:05,680
l'm just fooling myself.

782
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:08,748
She'll never see me
as anything...

783
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,488
but a monster.

784
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:17,967
lt's hopeless.

785
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:36,277
Oh, no!

786
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,446
Oh, yes!

787
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:38,512
Oh, no!

788
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:39,749
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

789
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,122
l've been burned by you before.

790
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,755
Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

791
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:55,501
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

792
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,298
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

793
00:36:57,336 --> 00:36:59,167
But l'm not sleepy.

794
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:00,832
Yes, you are.

795
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:03,341
No, l'm not.

796
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,502
l work and l slave all day long
and for what?

797
00:37:05,544 --> 00:37:08,638
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

798
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:09,909
Oh, stop your grousing.

799
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:11,940
lt's been a long night
for all of us.

800
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:14,885
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

801
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,683
After all, he did say please.

802
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:18,690
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

803
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:20,248
he'll never break...

804
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,089
Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.

805
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:26,120
l am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

806
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,431
This is Lumiere.

807
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:31,698
Enchante, cherie.

808
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:33,136
lf there's... Stop that!

809
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:34,662
...anything we... Please!

810
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:37,175
can do to make your
stay more comfortable.

811
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,233
Ow!

812
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:39,574
l am a little hungry.

813
00:37:39,645 --> 00:37:40,577
You are?

814
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:42,307
Hear that? She's hungry.

815
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:43,315
Stoke the fire.

816
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:44,077
Break out the silver.

817
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:45,583
Wake the china.

818
00:37:45,618 --> 00:37:48,143
Remember what the master said.

819
00:37:48,187 --> 00:37:49,245
Oh, pishposh.

820
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:51,483
l'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

821
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:52,581
All right, fine.

822
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:54,522
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

823
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,062
Cogsworth,
l am surprised at you.

824
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,592
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

825
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:01,825
We must make her
feel welcome here.

826
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,528
Right this way,
Mademoiselle.

827
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:04,694
Well, keep it down.

828
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:06,728
lf the master finds out
about this

829
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:07,966
it will be our necks.

830
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,305
Of course, of course.

831
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:13,140
But what is dinner
without a little music?

832
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:15,078
Music?

833
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:17,912
Ma chere
mademoiselle.

834
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,148
lt is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

835
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:24,314
that we welcome you tonight.

836
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:25,590
And now we invite you to relax.

837
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,557
And now we invite you to relax.

838
00:38:26,658 --> 00:38:28,216
Let us pull up a chair

839
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,922
as the dining room
proudly presents...

840
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:32,953
your dinner.

841
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:37,328
Be... our... guest

842
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,802
Be our guest

843
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:41,829
Put our service to the test

844
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:43,704
Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie

845
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:46,370
And we provide the rest

846
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,936
Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres

847
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,845
Why, we only live to serve

848
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,281
Try the gray stuff

849
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:53,443
lt's delicious

850
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:55,749
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

851
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:57,948
They can sing, they can dance

852
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:00,321
After all, Miss, this is France

853
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,419
And a dinner here
is never second best

854
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:06,931
Go on, unfold your menu

855
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:09,092
Take a glance and then

856
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:10,123
You'll be our guest

857
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:11,362
Oui, our guest

858
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:13,394
Be our guest

859
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,770
Beef ragout, cheese souffle

860
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,775
Pie and pudding en flambe

861
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:19,868
We'll prepare and serve
with flair

862
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:22,038
A culinary cabaret

863
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,275
You're alone and you're scared

864
00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:26,443
But the banquet's all prepared

865
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:28,419
No one's gloomy or complaining

866
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:30,546
While the flatware's
entertaining

867
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,817
We tell jokes, l do tricks

868
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:35,122
With my fellow candlesticks

869
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,256
And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet

870
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:41,424
Come on and lift your glass

871
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,058
You've won your own free pass

872
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:44,261
To be our guest--

873
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:45,769
lf you're stressed

874
00:39:45,804 --> 00:39:47,931
lt's fine dining we suggest--

875
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:50,339
Be our guest, be our guest

876
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,172
Be our guest!

877
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,509
Life is so unnerving

878
00:39:55,547 --> 00:39:58,573
For a servant who's not serving

879
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:01,848
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

880
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:03,582
Get off!

881
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:07,182
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

882
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:08,749
Huh?

883
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:10,784
Suddenly, those good
old days are gone

884
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:13,696
Oh!

885
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:15,597
Ten years we've been rusting

886
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,998
Needing so much more
than dusting

887
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:20,061
Needing exercise

888
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:23,097
A chance to use our skills

889
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:27,942
Most days we just
lay around the castle

890
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:29,412
Flabby, fat and lazy

891
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:31,574
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

892
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,481
lt's a guest, it's a guest!

893
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,315
Sakes alive,
well, l'll be blessed

894
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:37,378
Wine's been poured,
and thank the Lord

895
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,322
l've had the napkins
freshly pressed

896
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:41,757
With dessert, she'll want tea

897
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,283
And, my dear,
that's fine with me

898
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:45,455
While the cups
do their soft-shoeing

899
00:40:45,497 --> 00:40:47,522
l'll be bubbling,
l'll be brewing

900
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,329
l'll get warm, piping hot

901
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,460
Heaven's sake, is that a spot?

902
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:54,233
Clean it up, we want
the company impressed

903
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,433
We've got a lot to do

904
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,305
ls it one lump or two?

905
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,071
For you, our guest

906
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,236
She's our guest

907
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:01,506
She's our guest

908
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:03,070
She's our guest

909
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:07,175
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

910
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:09,118
lt's ten years since
we've had anybody here

911
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:10,143
And we're obsessed

912
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:12,418
With your meal, with your ease

913
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:14,288
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

914
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:16,726
While the candlelight's
still glowing

915
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:20,925
Let us help you,
we'll keep going

916
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:25,164
Course... by... course

917
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:27,262
One by one

918
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,967
Till you shout,
''Enough, l'm done!''

919
00:41:30,008 --> 00:41:34,342
Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest

920
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:36,506
Tonight you'll prop
your feet up

921
00:41:36,548 --> 00:41:38,175
But for now, let's eat up

922
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:42,380
Be our guest, be our guest

923
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,251
Be our guest

924
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:52,628
Please be our guest!

925
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:56,025
Bravo!

926
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:57,398
That was wonderful.

927
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:58,527
Thank you.

928
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,731
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

929
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:02,672
Good show, wasn't it?

930
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:04,140
Yes, everyone.

931
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:07,508
My goodness, look at the time.

932
00:42:07,545 --> 00:42:09,410
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

933
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,972
Oh, l couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

934
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:14,042
lt's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

935
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:16,178
Enchanted!

936
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:17,279
Who said anything

937
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:19,187
about the castle
being enchanted?

938
00:42:19,224 --> 00:42:21,317
lt was you, wasn't it?

939
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,156
l figured it out for myself.

940
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:28,222
l'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

941
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:29,819
Oh, would you like a tour?

942
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:31,524
Wait a second, wait a second.

943
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:33,362
l'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

944
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,732
We can't let her
go poking around

945
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,795
in certain places,
if you know what l mean.

946
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,329
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

947
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:41,807
l'm sure you know everything

948
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,537
there is to know
about the castle.

949
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:46,546
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

950
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,810
Yes, l do.

951
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:49,975
As you can see

952
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:52,917
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

953
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:55,251
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

954
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:58,451
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

955
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,857
This is yet another example

956
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:01,918
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

957
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:03,327
and, as l always say

958
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:05,593
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

959
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,230
Uh, where was l?

960
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,597
As you were.

961
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,039
Now, then, if l may
draw your attention

962
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:17,373
to the flying buttresses
above the...

963
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:18,969
Uh, Mademoiselle?

964
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,209
What's up there?

965
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:27,220
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

966
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:28,619
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

967
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:29,952
in the west wing.

968
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,049
Dusty, dull, very boring.

969
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:34,617
Ah, so that's the west wing.

970
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,424
Nice going.

971
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:39,432
l wonder what
he's hiding up there?

972
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:40,433
Hiding?

973
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:41,934
The master is hiding nothing.

974
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:43,765
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

975
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:46,238
Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to

976
00:43:46,273 --> 00:43:47,968
uh-uh, uh... see something else.

977
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,738
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

978
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:51,766
maybe later.

979
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:53,211
Th-The gardens or-or

980
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:55,180
the-the-the-the library,
perhaps.

981
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,443
You have a library?

982
00:43:56,483 --> 00:43:58,075
Yes, oh, indeed.

983
00:43:58,118 --> 00:43:59,210
With books.

984
00:43:59,252 --> 00:44:00,446
Scads of books!

985
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:01,511
Mountains of books!

986
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,544
Forests of books!

987
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:03,578
-Cascades!
-Longboats!

988
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:04,681
Swamps of books!

989
00:44:04,724 --> 00:44:06,589
More books than you'll

990
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,719
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

991
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:11,253
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

992
00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:13,316
who ever set pen to paper.

993
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,644
Oh!

994
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:54,349
Why did you come here?

995
00:45:54,393 --> 00:45:56,327
l'm... l'm sorry.

996
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:58,990
l warned you never to come here.

997
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,225
l didn't mean any harm.

998
00:46:00,266 --> 00:46:02,996
Do you realize
what you could have done?!

999
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,129
Please, stop.

1000
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:06,968
Get out!

1001
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:08,735
No!

1002
00:46:08,774 --> 00:46:12,710
Get... out!

1003
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:25,382
Where are you going?

1004
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,721
Promise or no promise

1005
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:28,522
l can't stay here
another minute.

1006
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:30,620
Oh, no, wait, please.

1007
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:31,991
Please wait.

1008
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:12,028
Oh!

1009
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,228
Oh!

1010
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,406
Here now.

1011
00:48:59,443 --> 00:49:00,933
Oh, don't do that.

1012
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:06,981
Just hold still.

1013
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:09,443
That hurts!

1014
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,454
lf you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

1015
00:49:11,555 --> 00:49:12,886
Well, if you hadn't
have run away

1016
00:49:12,923 --> 00:49:14,117
this wouldn't have happened!

1017
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:17,218
lf you hadn't frightened me,
l wouldn't have run away!

1018
00:49:17,261 --> 00:49:20,162
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

1019
00:49:20,197 --> 00:49:22,461
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

1020
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:26,969
Now hold still.

1021
00:49:27,004 --> 00:49:28,869
This might sting a little.

1022
00:49:28,906 --> 00:49:29,998
Hmm?

1023
00:49:31,408 --> 00:49:34,707
By the way, thank you.

1024
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:36,645
For saving my life.

1025
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,013
You're welcome.

1026
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,489
l don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night

1027
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:57,900
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

1028
00:49:57,935 --> 00:49:59,425
Ah.

1029
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:00,800
l'm listening.

1030
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:02,271
lt's like this.

1031
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:05,434
l've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

1032
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:08,445
but she needs a little...
persuasion.

1033
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:11,879
Turned him down flat.

1034
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,645
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

1035
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:14,673
He was in here tonight

1036
00:50:14,718 --> 00:50:17,551
raving about a beast
in a castle.

1037
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:19,283
Maurice is harmless.

1038
00:50:19,323 --> 00:50:21,985
The point is,
Belle would do anything

1039
00:50:22,026 --> 00:50:24,426
to keep him
from being locked up.

1040
00:50:26,297 --> 00:50:27,730
Yeah. Even marry him.

1041
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,660
So you want me

1042
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:33,736
to throw her father
into the asylum

1043
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:36,700
unless she agrees to marry you.

1044
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:40,334
Oh, that is despicable.

1045
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:41,741
l love it!

1046
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,680
lf no one will help me

1047
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:47,446
then l'll go back alone.

1048
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,182
Yes, is that everything?

1049
00:50:49,222 --> 00:50:51,156
l don't care what it takes.

1050
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,522
l'll find that castle,
and somehow

1051
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,459
l'll get her out of there.

1052
00:51:01,234 --> 00:51:02,929
Belle? Maurice?

1053
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:04,903
Oh, well.

1054
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,734
l guess it's not going
to work after all.

1055
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:09,241
They have to come back sometime.

1056
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,904
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

1057
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,276
Lefou...

1058
00:51:14,313 --> 00:51:17,339
don't move from that spot

1059
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:19,146
until Belle and
her father come home.

1060
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:21,176
But, but, l...

1061
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:24,723
Aw, nuts.

1062
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:51,973
l've never felt this way
about anyone.

1063
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:54,350
l want to do something for her.

1064
00:51:54,387 --> 00:51:55,945
But what?

1065
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,047
Well, there's the usual things.

1066
00:51:58,091 --> 00:51:59,388
Flowers, chocolates.

1067
00:51:59,425 --> 00:52:01,222
Promises you don't intend
to keep.

1068
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,057
Ah, no, no.

1069
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:05,462
lt has to be something
very special.

1070
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,762
Something that sparks
her interest.

1071
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,062
Wait a minute!

1072
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:15,864
Belle, there's something
l want to show you.

1073
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:19,969
But first, you have
to close your eyes.

1074
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,538
lt's a surprise.

1075
00:52:34,727 --> 00:52:36,217
Can l open them?

1076
00:52:36,262 --> 00:52:38,253
No, no. Not yet.

1077
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:40,959
Wait here.

1078
00:52:45,138 --> 00:52:46,571
Now can l open them?

1079
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:48,267
All right.

1080
00:52:48,307 --> 00:52:49,467
Now.

1081
00:52:58,184 --> 00:53:00,584
l can't believe it!

1082
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,815
l've never seen so many books
in all my life!

1083
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:04,516
You-You like it?

1084
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,218
lt's wonderful!

1085
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:08,193
Then it's yours.

1086
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,218
Oh, thank you so much.

1087
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:11,958
Oh, would you look at that!

1088
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:13,966
l knew it would work.

1089
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,160
What? What worked?

1090
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:17,965
lt's very encouraging.

1091
00:53:18,004 --> 00:53:19,631
lsn't this exciting?

1092
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,104
l didn't see anything.

1093
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,300
Come along, Chip.

1094
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:24,070
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

1095
00:53:24,136 --> 00:53:25,535
But what are they talking about?

1096
00:53:25,571 --> 00:53:26,936
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

1097
00:54:14,353 --> 00:54:16,412
There's something sweet

1098
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:18,116
And almost kind

1099
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:21,752
But he was mean,
and he was coarse and unrefined

1100
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:25,787
And now he's dear, and so unsure

1101
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:28,459
l wonder why l didn't see it
there before

1102
00:54:43,015 --> 00:54:45,279
She glanced this way

1103
00:54:45,317 --> 00:54:46,875
l thought l saw

1104
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:50,650
And when we touched,
she didn't shudder at my paw

1105
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:52,350
No, it can't be

1106
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:54,450
l'll just ignore

1107
00:54:54,493 --> 00:54:58,486
But then she's never looked
at me that way before

1108
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:07,130
New and a bit alarming

1109
00:55:07,172 --> 00:55:15,637
Who'd have ever thought
that this could be?

1110
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:22,450
True that he's no
Prince Charming

1111
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:25,082
But there's something in him

1112
00:55:25,124 --> 00:55:30,619
That l simply didn't see...

1113
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:31,823
Well, who'd have thought?

1114
00:55:31,864 --> 00:55:32,831
Well, bless my soul

1115
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:33,991
Well, who'd have known?

1116
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:34,965
Well, who indeed?

1117
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,989
And who'd have guessed

1118
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:37,525
They'd come together
on their own?

1119
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,502
lt's so peculiar

1120
00:55:38,537 --> 00:55:39,504
We'll wait and see

1121
00:55:39,538 --> 00:55:42,371
A few days more

1122
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:46,845
There may be something there
that wasn't there before...

1123
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:48,676
You know, perhaps there is

1124
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:51,875
Something there
that wasn't there before

1125
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,646
What?

1126
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:57,144
There may be something there
that wasn't there before.

1127
00:55:57,189 --> 00:55:58,747
What's there, Mama?

1128
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,156
Shh!

1129
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:04,288
l'll tell you when you're older.

1130
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,297
Right, then!

1131
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,958
You all know why we're here.

1132
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:10,526
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

1133
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:12,434
to create the most magical

1134
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:16,498
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

1135
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:17,873
''Or beast...''

1136
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,342
Right.

1137
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,814
Need l remind you

1138
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:27,478
that if the last petal falls
from this rose

1139
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:28,747
the spell will never be...

1140
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:30,652
broken!

1141
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:32,179
Very well.

1142
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:34,215
You all know your assignments.

1143
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:36,159
Half of you to the west wing.

1144
00:56:36,195 --> 00:56:38,060
Half of you to the east wing.

1145
00:56:38,097 --> 00:56:40,122
The rest of you, come with me.

1146
00:56:44,703 --> 00:56:48,161
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

1147
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:50,903
lt's obvious there's
a spark between them.

1148
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,844
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

1149
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:55,714
You know... a little.

1150
00:56:56,715 --> 00:56:57,943
Besides, they must fall in love

1151
00:56:57,983 --> 00:56:59,780
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

1152
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:01,251
Ah, human again.

1153
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:02,810
Human again.

1154
00:57:02,855 --> 00:57:05,915
Yes, think what that means.

1155
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:11,388
l'll be cooking again

1156
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:13,330
Be good looking again

1157
00:57:13,365 --> 00:57:17,096
With a mademoiselle on each arm

1158
00:57:17,135 --> 00:57:19,797
When l'm human again

1159
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,499
Only human again

1160
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,101
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

1161
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:26,940
l'll be courting again

1162
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:28,844
Chic and sporting again

1163
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:31,816
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

1164
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,512
Ha, ha!
l'll hop down off this shelf

1165
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:36,418
And tout de suite be myself

1166
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:39,515
l can't wait to be human again

1167
00:57:41,493 --> 00:57:43,654
When we're human again

1168
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:45,526
Only human again

1169
00:57:45,564 --> 00:57:48,465
When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more

1170
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,335
When we're human again,
good and human again

1171
00:57:53,372 --> 00:57:55,840
Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer?

1172
00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:57,865
l'll wear lipstick and rouge

1173
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,241
And l won't be so huge

1174
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:02,907
Why, l'll easily fit
through that door

1175
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:04,813
l'll exude savoir faire

1176
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,818
l'll wear gowns, l'll have hair

1177
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:10,015
lt's my prayer to be human again

1178
00:58:15,193 --> 00:58:16,785
When we're human again

1179
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:18,591
Only human again

1180
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:21,963
When the world once more
starts making sense

1181
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,627
l'll unwind, for a change

1182
00:58:23,669 --> 00:58:25,364
Really? That'd be strange

1183
00:58:25,404 --> 00:58:28,498
Can l help it if l'm t-t-tense?

1184
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,007
ln a shack by the sea

1185
00:58:30,042 --> 00:58:31,805
l'll sit back, sipping tea

1186
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:35,176
Let my early retirement commence

1187
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:36,908
Far from fools made of wax

1188
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:40,646
l'll get down to brass tacks
and relax!

1189
00:58:40,686 --> 00:58:44,417
When l'm human again

1190
00:58:44,456 --> 00:58:47,948
So sweep the dust from the floor

1191
00:58:47,993 --> 00:58:51,554
Let's let some light in the room

1192
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:53,223
l can feel, l can tell

1193
00:58:53,265 --> 00:58:56,325
Someone might break the spell
any day now

1194
00:58:58,036 --> 00:59:01,494
Shine up the brass on the door

1195
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,373
Alert the dust pail and broom

1196
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,468
lf it all goes as planned

1197
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:11,813
Our time may be at hand
any day now

1198
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,217
Open the shutters,
and let in some air

1199
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:19,212
Put these here,
and put those over there

1200
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:22,658
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

1201
00:59:22,694 --> 00:59:25,424
And throw them away

1202
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:34,266
We'll be human again

1203
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:36,467
Only human again

1204
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:39,204
When the girl
finally sets us all free

1205
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:41,804
Cheeks a-blooming again

1206
00:59:41,847 --> 00:59:43,712
We're assuming again

1207
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:46,718
We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre

1208
00:59:46,752 --> 00:59:47,946
We'll be playing again

1209
00:59:47,986 --> 00:59:50,284
Holidaying again

1210
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:53,485
And we're praying it's ASAP

1211
00:59:53,525 --> 00:59:55,584
We will push, we will shove

1212
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:57,527
They will both fall in love

1213
00:59:57,562 --> 01:00:01,362
And we'll finally
be human again...

1214
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:06,164
For never was a story
of more woe

1215
01:00:06,204 --> 01:00:09,503
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

1216
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:12,032
Could you read it again?

1217
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:14,238
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

1218
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:16,440
Uh, all right.

1219
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:19,348
Uh...

1220
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:21,682
Uh... l can't.

1221
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,450
You mean, you never learned?

1222
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:26,684
l learned... a little.

1223
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:29,420
lt's just been so long.

1224
01:00:29,461 --> 01:00:31,691
Well, here, l'll help you.

1225
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:33,355
Let's start here.

1226
01:00:33,398 --> 01:00:36,128
Here.

1227
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:38,136
Okay, ''Twoe...''

1228
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,137
''Two.''

1229
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:41,298
''Two... l knew that.

1230
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:44,001
Two households...''

1231
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:48,103
We'll be dancing again

1232
01:00:48,146 --> 01:00:49,807
We'll be twirling again

1233
01:00:49,848 --> 01:00:53,375
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

1234
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:54,715
When we're human again

1235
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,447
Only human again

1236
01:00:56,488 --> 01:01:00,151
We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes

1237
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:02,126
We'll be floating again

1238
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,422
We'll be gliding again

1239
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:07,125
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please

1240
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:10,498
Like a real human does

1241
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:14,062
l'll be all that l was

1242
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:18,634
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

1243
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:22,238
And we're all

1244
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,513
Human again!

1245
01:01:40,232 --> 01:01:43,201
Tonight is the night.

1246
01:01:43,235 --> 01:01:45,999
l'm not sure l can do this.

1247
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:47,629
You don't have time to be timid.

1248
01:01:47,672 --> 01:01:49,936
You must be bold, daring.

1249
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:51,704
Bold, daring.

1250
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:56,877
There will be music...

1251
01:01:56,915 --> 01:01:59,315
romantic candlelight...

1252
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:01,319
provided by myself.

1253
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:02,843
And when the moment is right

1254
01:02:02,888 --> 01:02:04,651
you confess your love.

1255
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:06,657
Yes, l con...

1256
01:02:06,725 --> 01:02:09,558
l-l... No, l can't.

1257
01:02:09,594 --> 01:02:11,027
You care for the girl,
don't you?

1258
01:02:11,062 --> 01:02:13,326
More than anything.

1259
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:15,094
Well, then,
you must tell her.

1260
01:02:17,169 --> 01:02:18,500
Voila!

1261
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:20,869
Oh, you look so... so...

1262
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:22,840
Stupid.

1263
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:26,002
Not quite the word
l was looking for.

1264
01:02:26,044 --> 01:02:28,069
Perhaps a little more
off the top?

1265
01:02:30,515 --> 01:02:35,720
Your lady awaits.

1266
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:03,743
Tale as old as time

1267
01:03:03,782 --> 01:03:06,216
True as it can be

1268
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,853
Barely even friends

1269
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,450
Then somebody bends

1270
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:16,722
Unexpectedly

1271
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:21,126
Just a little change

1272
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:26,897
Small, to say the least

1273
01:03:26,938 --> 01:03:29,532
Both a little scared

1274
01:03:29,574 --> 01:03:32,668
Neither one prepared

1275
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:35,541
Beauty and the Beast

1276
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,315
Ever just the same

1277
01:03:43,455 --> 01:03:46,049
Ever a surprise

1278
01:03:46,091 --> 01:03:48,218
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1279
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,990
Ever as before

1280
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:53,429
Ever just as sure

1281
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:56,992
As the sun will rise

1282
01:03:58,503 --> 01:04:03,236
Tale as old as time

1283
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:07,871
Tune as old as song

1284
01:04:07,912 --> 01:04:11,109
Bittersweet and strange

1285
01:04:11,149 --> 01:04:13,640
Finding you can change

1286
01:04:13,718 --> 01:04:16,619
Learning you were wrong

1287
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:23,289
Certain as the sun

1288
01:04:23,328 --> 01:04:26,229
Rising in the east

1289
01:04:26,264 --> 01:04:28,494
Tale as old as time

1290
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:31,297
Song as old as rhyme

1291
01:04:31,336 --> 01:04:34,362
Beauty and the Beast

1292
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:36,169
Shh!

1293
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:40,904
Tale as old as time

1294
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:45,143
Song as old as rhyme

1295
01:04:45,183 --> 01:04:52,316
Beauty and the Beast.

1296
01:04:52,357 --> 01:04:55,986
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

1297
01:04:56,027 --> 01:04:58,257
lt's past your bedtime.

1298
01:04:58,296 --> 01:05:00,696
Good night, love.

1299
01:05:24,122 --> 01:05:27,649
Belle?

1300
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:31,150
Are you... happy here with me?

1301
01:05:31,196 --> 01:05:33,061
Yes.

1302
01:05:37,102 --> 01:05:39,570
What is it?

1303
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:42,300
lf only l could see
my father again

1304
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,967
just for a moment.

1305
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:45,407
l miss him so much.

1306
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:54,017
There is a way.

1307
01:05:55,253 --> 01:05:57,778
This mirror will show
you anything...

1308
01:05:57,822 --> 01:06:01,258
anything you wish to see.

1309
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:04,125
l'd like to see my father,
please.

1310
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:12,263
Papa?

1311
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:13,531
Oh, no.

1312
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:15,835
He's sick.

1313
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:19,503
He may be dying
and he's all alone.

1314
01:06:24,716 --> 01:06:28,208
Then, you must go to him.

1315
01:06:28,253 --> 01:06:29,550
What did you say?

1316
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:30,645
l release you.

1317
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:33,122
You are no longer my prisoner.

1318
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:35,786
You mean... l'm free?

1319
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:37,886
Yes.

1320
01:06:37,929 --> 01:06:40,124
Oh, thank you.

1321
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:42,326
Hold on, Papa.

1322
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:44,631
l'm on my way.

1323
01:06:44,669 --> 01:06:46,466
Take it with you

1324
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:50,907
so you'll always have
a way to look back

1325
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:52,773
and remember me.

1326
01:06:55,447 --> 01:06:58,416
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

1327
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:09,492
Well, Your Highness, l must say

1328
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:12,291
everything is going
just swimmingly.

1329
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,389
l knew you had it in you.

1330
01:07:14,432 --> 01:07:15,899
l let her go.

1331
01:07:15,934 --> 01:07:17,902
Yes, yes.

1332
01:07:17,936 --> 01:07:19,733
Splen...

1333
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:22,638
You what?

1334
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,230
How could you do that?

1335
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:25,742
l had to.

1336
01:07:25,777 --> 01:07:27,404
Yes, but...

1337
01:07:27,445 --> 01:07:28,742
Why?

1338
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,477
Because... l love her.

1339
01:07:32,517 --> 01:07:34,007
He did what?

1340
01:07:34,052 --> 01:07:35,246
Yes.

1341
01:07:35,286 --> 01:07:36,981
l'm afraid it's true.

1342
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:38,454
She's going away?

1343
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,549
But he was so close.

1344
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:45,052
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1345
01:07:45,096 --> 01:07:47,792
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

1346
01:07:47,832 --> 01:07:49,390
But it's not enough.

1347
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:51,800
She has to love him in return.

1348
01:07:51,836 --> 01:07:55,135
Now it's too late.

1349
01:08:03,648 --> 01:08:06,481
Papa! Papa!

1350
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:21,594
Ooh.

1351
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:23,760
They're back.

1352
01:08:25,036 --> 01:08:26,298
Belle?

1353
01:08:26,337 --> 01:08:27,326
Shh.

1354
01:08:27,372 --> 01:08:28,771
lt's all right, Papa.

1355
01:08:28,806 --> 01:08:30,899
l'm home.

1356
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:32,136
l thought l'd never

1357
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:34,736
see you again.

1358
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:36,644
l missed you so much.

1359
01:08:36,714 --> 01:08:37,646
But the Beast?

1360
01:08:37,715 --> 01:08:39,649
Did you... how did you escape?

1361
01:08:39,684 --> 01:08:40,981
l didn't escape, Papa.

1362
01:08:41,019 --> 01:08:42,247
He let me go.

1363
01:08:42,287 --> 01:08:43,652
That horrible beast?

1364
01:08:43,755 --> 01:08:46,781
But he's different now, Papa.

1365
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:49,088
He's changed somehow.

1366
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:54,359
Hi.

1367
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,300
Oh. A stowaway.

1368
01:08:57,335 --> 01:09:00,793
Why, hello there, little fella.

1369
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:02,635
Didn't think l'd see you again.

1370
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:04,164
Belle, why'd you go away?

1371
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:05,835
Don't you like us anymore?

1372
01:09:05,877 --> 01:09:08,937
Oh, Chip, of course l do.

1373
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,049
lt's just...

1374
01:09:14,018 --> 01:09:15,178
May l help you?

1375
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:17,153
l've come to collect
your father.

1376
01:09:17,188 --> 01:09:18,678
My father?

1377
01:09:18,723 --> 01:09:20,691
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

1378
01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:22,920
We'll take good care of him.

1379
01:09:24,295 --> 01:09:25,455
My father's not crazy.

1380
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:27,293
He was raving like a lunatic.

1381
01:09:27,332 --> 01:09:29,163
We all heard him, didn't we?

1382
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:33,694
No, l won't let you.

1383
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:34,703
Belle?

1384
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:37,401
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1385
01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:39,410
Just how big was the beast?

1386
01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:44,706
He was... l mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

1387
01:09:44,816 --> 01:09:46,511
l-l'd say at least eight...

1388
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:48,951
No, more like ten feet.

1389
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:53,117
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1390
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:56,553
lt's true, l tell you.

1391
01:09:56,594 --> 01:09:58,562
Get him out of here.

1392
01:09:58,596 --> 01:09:59,893
Let go of me.

1393
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:01,023
No!

1394
01:10:01,065 --> 01:10:03,124
You can't do this.

1395
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:04,031
Poor Belle.

1396
01:10:04,068 --> 01:10:06,662
lt's a shame about your father.

1397
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:08,604
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1398
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,541
Hmm, l might be able
to clear up this...

1399
01:10:11,576 --> 01:10:13,305
little misunderstanding.

1400
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:14,436
lf...

1401
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:15,309
lf what?

1402
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:17,280
lf you marry me.

1403
01:10:17,315 --> 01:10:18,282
What?

1404
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:19,977
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

1405
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:21,007
Never.

1406
01:10:21,052 --> 01:10:22,679
Have it your way.

1407
01:10:22,754 --> 01:10:23,550
Belle.

1408
01:10:25,223 --> 01:10:26,781
Let go of me.

1409
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:29,452
My father's not crazy
and l can prove it.

1410
01:10:29,494 --> 01:10:31,724
Show me the Beast.

1411
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:37,698
ls it dangerous?

1412
01:10:37,769 --> 01:10:40,169
Oh, no, no,
he'd never hurt anyone.

1413
01:10:40,204 --> 01:10:44,698
Please, l know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1414
01:10:44,809 --> 01:10:46,333
He's my friend.

1415
01:10:46,377 --> 01:10:47,571
lf l didn't know better

1416
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:50,172
l'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1417
01:10:50,214 --> 01:10:52,739
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

1418
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,921
She's as crazy as the old man.

1419
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:00,354
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1420
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:01,255
-He'll come after them
in the night.
-No!

1421
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:02,259
We're not safe

1422
01:11:02,293 --> 01:11:03,851
till his head
is mounted on my wall.

1423
01:11:03,895 --> 01:11:05,658
l say we kill the Beast!

1424
01:11:06,698 --> 01:11:08,495
We're not safe until he's dead

1425
01:11:08,533 --> 01:11:10,125
He'll come stalking us at night

1426
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:12,068
Set to sacrifice our children

1427
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:13,866
To his monstrous appetite

1428
01:11:13,905 --> 01:11:15,668
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1429
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,297
lf we let him wander free

1430
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:21,038
So it's time to take
some action, boys

1431
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:26,210
lt's time to follow me

1432
01:11:27,919 --> 01:11:29,784
Through the mist,
through the woods

1433
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:31,686
Through the darkness
and the shadows

1434
01:11:31,723 --> 01:11:34,089
lt's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride

1435
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:37,561
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

1436
01:11:37,595 --> 01:11:41,031
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1437
01:11:41,065 --> 01:11:43,693
lt's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones

1438
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:47,134
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

1439
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:49,139
Hear him roar, see him foam

1440
01:11:49,173 --> 01:11:50,868
But we're not coming home

1441
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:52,307
Till he's dead

1442
01:11:52,343 --> 01:11:54,072
Good and dead

1443
01:11:54,112 --> 01:11:55,204
Kill the Beast!

1444
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:56,838
No, l won't let you do this.

1445
01:11:56,881 --> 01:11:59,406
lf you're not with us,
you're against us.

1446
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,508
Bring the old man.

1447
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:02,178
Get your hands off me.

1448
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,654
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1449
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:05,951
Let us out!

1450
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,652
We'll rid the village
of this beast.

1451
01:12:08,726 --> 01:12:09,818
Who's with me?

1452
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:13,420
Raise your torch,
mount your horse

1453
01:12:13,464 --> 01:12:15,796
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1454
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:18,267
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1455
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:20,099
Through the mist,
through the wood

1456
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:21,765
Where, within a haunted castle

1457
01:12:21,806 --> 01:12:24,434
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

1458
01:12:24,475 --> 01:12:28,036
lt's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain

1459
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,242
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1460
01:12:31,282 --> 01:12:33,079
Sally forth, tally ho

1461
01:12:33,117 --> 01:12:34,675
Grab your sword, grab your bow

1462
01:12:34,786 --> 01:12:36,276
Praise the Lord, and here we go.

1463
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,687
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1464
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,055
l have to warn the Beast.

1465
01:12:42,093 --> 01:12:43,993
This is all my fault.

1466
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:45,962
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

1467
01:12:45,997 --> 01:12:47,328
Now, now.

1468
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:48,889
We'll think of something.

1469
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:53,163
Ah!

1470
01:12:56,107 --> 01:12:58,507
We don't like
what we don't understand

1471
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:00,272
ln fact, it scares us

1472
01:13:00,311 --> 01:13:02,905
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1473
01:13:02,947 --> 01:13:04,437
Bring your guns,
bring your knives

1474
01:13:04,482 --> 01:13:06,006
Save your children
and your wives

1475
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,144
We'll save our village
and our lives

1476
01:13:09,187 --> 01:13:10,654
We'll kill the Beast!

1477
01:13:10,688 --> 01:13:12,087
l knew it.

1478
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:14,523
l knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1479
01:13:14,559 --> 01:13:17,357
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1480
01:13:18,629 --> 01:13:19,857
Could it be?

1481
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:20,659
ls it she?

1482
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,130
Sacre bleu!

1483
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:23,133
lnvaders.

1484
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,464
Encroachers.

1485
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:25,867
And they have the mirror.

1486
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:26,927
Warn the master.

1487
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:28,905
lf it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1488
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:29,929
Who's with me?

1489
01:13:29,974 --> 01:13:30,963
Ah!

1490
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:32,999
Take whatever booty you can find

1491
01:13:33,044 --> 01:13:36,138
but remember, the Beast is mine!

1492
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,909
Lights ablaze, banners high

1493
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:39,644
We go marching into battle

1494
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:42,380
Unafraid, although
the danger just increased

1495
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,149
Raise the flag, sing the song

1496
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:45,519
Here we come, we're 50 strong

1497
01:13:45,556 --> 01:13:48,081
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1498
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,922
Let's kill the Beast!

1499
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,063
-Pardon me, Master?
-Leave me in peace.

1500
01:13:54,098 --> 01:13:56,498
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

1501
01:13:56,534 --> 01:13:59,628
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1502
01:13:59,704 --> 01:14:01,501
This isn't working.

1503
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:04,007
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

1504
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:06,532
Wait, l know.

1505
01:14:08,913 --> 01:14:11,746
What shall we do, Master?

1506
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:14,307
lt doesn't matter now.

1507
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:16,411
Just let them come.

1508
01:14:16,454 --> 01:14:19,787
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1509
01:14:19,824 --> 01:14:21,052
Kill the Beast!

1510
01:14:34,071 --> 01:14:34,765
Now!

1511
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,022
Yes!

1512
01:15:00,631 --> 01:15:02,292
Here we go.

1513
01:15:05,636 --> 01:15:07,228
What the devil?

1514
01:15:08,339 --> 01:15:09,601
Belle, look out!

1515
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:19,145
You guys got to try this thing.

1516
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:27,956
Up here you scurvy scum! Now!

1517
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:47,440
Oh!

1518
01:16:37,795 --> 01:16:40,263
And stay out!

1519
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:43,868
Eww!

1520
01:17:09,727 --> 01:17:11,058
Get up.

1521
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,092
Get up!

1522
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:17,794
What's the matter, Beast?

1523
01:17:17,835 --> 01:17:21,430
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1524
01:17:28,112 --> 01:17:29,545
No!

1525
01:17:33,184 --> 01:17:33,912
Belle...

1526
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:36,385
No! Gaston, don't!

1527
01:17:42,059 --> 01:17:44,960
Let's go, Philippe.

1528
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:10,180
Come on out and fight!

1529
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:15,725
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1530
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:18,557
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1531
01:18:18,596 --> 01:18:20,962
when she had someone like me?

1532
01:18:31,842 --> 01:18:34,504
lt's over, Beast.

1533
01:18:34,545 --> 01:18:36,274
Belle is mine!

1534
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:43,346
Let me go. Let me go.

1535
01:18:43,387 --> 01:18:45,116
Please, don't hurt me.

1536
01:18:45,156 --> 01:18:46,180
l'll do anything.

1537
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,850
Anything!

1538
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:03,968
Get out.

1539
01:19:04,008 --> 01:19:06,203
Beast!

1540
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:07,403
Belle?

1541
01:19:15,386 --> 01:19:17,581
Belle?

1542
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:25,693
You came back.

1543
01:20:03,834 --> 01:20:06,803
You...

1544
01:20:06,837 --> 01:20:08,498
You came back.

1545
01:20:08,539 --> 01:20:10,200
Of course l came back.

1546
01:20:10,241 --> 01:20:12,004
l couldn't let them...

1547
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:13,976
Oh, this is all my fault.

1548
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:16,411
lf only l'd gotten here sooner.

1549
01:20:16,447 --> 01:20:19,939
Maybe... it's better...

1550
01:20:19,984 --> 01:20:21,281
it's better this way.

1551
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:23,650
Don't talk like that.

1552
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:25,177
You'll be all right.

1553
01:20:25,222 --> 01:20:26,655
We're together now.

1554
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:29,022
Everything's going to be fine.

1555
01:20:29,059 --> 01:20:31,254
You'll see.

1556
01:20:31,295 --> 01:20:34,560
And... at least...

1557
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:37,328
l got to see you...

1558
01:20:37,368 --> 01:20:39,063
one last time.

1559
01:20:49,813 --> 01:20:51,440
No. No.

1560
01:20:51,482 --> 01:20:55,441
Please... Please...

1561
01:20:55,486 --> 01:20:57,454
Please, don't leave me.

1562
01:20:59,623 --> 01:21:03,491
l love you.

1563
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:42,424
Belle.

1564
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,120
lt's me.

1565
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:01,105
lt is you.

1566
01:23:33,744 --> 01:23:36,110
Lumiere.

1567
01:23:36,146 --> 01:23:38,774
Cogsworth!

1568
01:23:38,816 --> 01:23:41,011
Mrs. Potts!

1569
01:23:41,051 --> 01:23:42,211
Look at us.

1570
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:43,844
Mama, Mama.

1571
01:23:49,259 --> 01:23:50,590
My goodness.

1572
01:23:50,627 --> 01:23:52,458
lt is a miracle.

1573
01:24:03,307 --> 01:24:04,672
L'amour.

1574
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:10,843
Well, Lumiere, old friend.

1575
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:12,178
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1576
01:24:12,216 --> 01:24:13,183
Of course, mon ami.

1577
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:14,844
l told you she would
break the spell.

1578
01:24:14,885 --> 01:24:17,513
l beg your pardon, old friend

1579
01:24:17,554 --> 01:24:19,886
but l believe l told you.

1580
01:24:19,923 --> 01:24:21,652
No, you didn't-- l told you.

1581
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:23,284
You most certainly did not

1582
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:25,659
you pompous,
paraffin-headed peabrain.

1583
01:24:25,696 --> 01:24:28,324
En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.

1584
01:24:28,365 --> 01:24:29,627
Take that.

1585
01:24:33,537 --> 01:24:37,439
Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?

1586
01:24:37,474 --> 01:24:39,442
Of course, my dear.

1587
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:41,637
Of course.

1588
01:24:41,678 --> 01:24:44,772
Do l still have
to sleep in the cupboard?

1589
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:53,517
Certain as the sun

1590
01:24:53,557 --> 01:24:55,923
Rising in the east

1591
01:24:55,959 --> 01:24:58,894
Tale as old as time

1592
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:01,193
Song as old as rhyme

1593
01:25:01,231 --> 01:25:07,568
Beauty and the Beast

1594
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:10,198
Tale as old as time

1595
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,539
Song as old as rhyme

1596
01:25:13,577 --> 01:25:20,278
Beauty and the Beast.

1597
01:25:35,232 --> 01:25:39,965
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

1598
01:25:44,241 --> 01:25:50,578
Tale as old as time

1599
01:25:50,614 --> 01:25:56,246
True as it can be

1600
01:25:56,286 --> 01:25:59,915
Barely even friends

1601
01:25:59,957 --> 01:26:02,926
Then somebody bends

1602
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:08,956
Unexpectedly

1603
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:15,302
Just a little change

1604
01:26:15,339 --> 01:26:18,604
Small to say the least

1605
01:26:18,642 --> 01:26:21,611
Both a little scared

1606
01:26:21,645 --> 01:26:25,012
Neither one prepared

1607
01:26:25,048 --> 01:26:30,452
Beauty and the Beast

1608
01:26:30,487 --> 01:26:36,892
Ever just the same

1609
01:26:36,927 --> 01:26:43,230
Ever a surprise

1610
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:46,531
Ever as before

1611
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:49,562
And ever just as sure

1612
01:26:49,606 --> 01:26:54,441
As the sun will rise

1613
01:26:54,478 --> 01:26:57,777
Whoa, oh-oh

1614
01:26:57,814 --> 01:27:00,612
Whoa, oh

1615
01:27:17,334 --> 01:27:20,633
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

1616
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:27,304
Ever just the same

1617
01:27:27,344 --> 01:27:33,283
Ever a surprise

1618
01:27:33,316 --> 01:27:36,285
Ever as before

1619
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:39,288
Ever just as sure

1620
01:27:39,322 --> 01:27:43,622
As the sun will rise

1621
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:48,996
Oh, oh, oh...

1622
01:27:49,032 --> 01:27:55,528
Tale as old as time

1623
01:27:55,572 --> 01:28:01,602
Tune as old as song

1624
01:28:01,678 --> 01:28:04,613
Bittersweet and strange

1625
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:07,616
Finding you can change

1626
01:28:07,718 --> 01:28:13,987
Learning you were wrong

1627
01:28:14,024 --> 01:28:17,323
Certain as the sun

1628
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,625
Certain as the sun

1629
01:28:20,697 --> 01:28:23,632
Rising in the east

1630
01:28:23,667 --> 01:28:26,329
Tale as old as time

1631
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:29,361
Song as old as rhyme

1632
01:28:29,406 --> 01:28:35,641
Beauty and the Beast

1633
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,012
Tale as old as time

1634
01:28:39,049 --> 01:28:42,644
Song as old as rhyme

1635
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:53,653
Beauty and the Beast

1636
01:28:53,697 --> 01:28:57,497
Oh, oh-oh-oh

1637
01:28:57,534 --> 01:29:01,334
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1638
01:29:06,176 --> 01:29:10,374
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

1639
01:29:13,383 --> 01:29:27,923
Beauty and the Beast.
