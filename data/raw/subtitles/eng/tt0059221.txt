1
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,421
<i>Ow!</i>

2
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,860
<i>Oh, murder.!
Oh, murder.!</i>

3
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,866
Murder! Help!
A man's gettin' murdered!

4
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,426
<i>Murder.! Help.! Help.!</i>

5
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,529
Help!

6
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,405
It's Calver Weems!
He's dead!

7
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,502
He's been murdered! Oh,
don't panic! Don't panic!

8
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,911
Oh, Luther, Luther,
it was terrible!

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,507
He was walking along
the street, when bang!

10
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,347
Right on the head.
With that.

11
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,353
Did you see who did it? No.

12
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,185
It was just bang! Right
on the head! With that!

13
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,158
I'll get a picture
of it. Let's see.

14
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,888
F-32. And it's dark.
It's been raining.

15
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:47,126
And... Oh, for heaven sakes, stand back,
Susanna! Stand back! Get out of the way!

16
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,226
And for heaven sakes, don't touch
anything. This is all evidence.

17
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,828
He was just walking down
the street, when bang!

18
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,773
Right on the head! All right. I'll
get a picture of the murder weapon.

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,935
Bang!
Right on the head!

20
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,673
I was just getting ready to brush
my teeth and watch Lawrence Welk,

21
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,942
when I looked out
the window and bang!

22
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,246
For heaven sakes, Susanna!
Pull yourself together!

23
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,287
I'm going to the police station. You
get on the phone and call my editor.

24
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,288
Who?
George Beckett!

25
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,154
Tell him to get down to the
police station as soon as possible.

26
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,888
And for heaven sakes, whatever
you do, keep your head!

27
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,157
I don't want to
stay here by myself!

28
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,428
Well, I told you to get on
the phone and call my editor!

29
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,696
Now, go on!

30
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,761
Aah!

31
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,684
Hey, Heggs.
Wait a minute.

32
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,815
Ollie, what are you doin' here? The
price tag on your suit's hangin' out.

33
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,918
That's my press card, and you
know it. Beckett called. What's up?

34
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,929
I got a story!
That's what's up!

35
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,465
You just sit tight. If there's
a story, I'll handle it.

36
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,560
Chief! You'd better get somebody out
to the old Simmons mansion right away!

37
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,003
A terrible thing happened! I
got the pictures and everything!

38
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,009
I was coming down the street... Now,
wait a minute, Luther. Just calm down.

39
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,637
Give it to me nice and slow.
I was comin' down the street...

40
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,874
Too fast.
Yeah, cool it, sport.

41
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,109
What happened, Luther? Well,
I was comin' down the street...

42
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,311
What's up? Oh, Mr. Beckett, I'm glad...

43
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,049
I got this call from Susanna Blush:
two-by-fours, Calver Weems, Lawrence Welk...

44
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,422
I'm glad you're here. I got a real
scoop... pictures and everything.

45
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,929
I've been trying to get the story from
Walter Cronkite here, but he just won't give.

46
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,194
- What's this all about?
- I don't know. He's so keyed up.

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,930
- Will somebody listen to me?
- All right, Luther. Just calm down.

48
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,404
Calm? Calm?

49
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,441
Do "murder" and "calm"
go together?

50
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,443
"Calm" and "murder"?
"Murder"?

51
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,945
Murder?
Murder!

52
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,005
Well, all right, Luther.
Let's hear it.

53
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,279
All right! Well, I was out
on Warren Harding Road...

54
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,321
and I passed the Simmons mansion when
all of a sudden I heard this scream...

55
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,323
"Help! Help! Murder!"
Murder?

56
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,689
Yeah, murder. Quick as a flash,
I whipped my Edsel around,

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,320
I sped back to the scene of
the crime, got out of the car...

58
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,330
and there it was.

59
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,889
Do I have to tell you how I
felt when I saw it laying there?

60
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,562
Saw what? The dead body of Calver Weems.

61
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,696
He'd been bludgeoned
to death by a board.

62
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,502
I'd better get somebody
out there right away.

63
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,975
Did you see that happen? No, Susanna
Blush saw it. She's an eyewitness.

64
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,537
- Susanna Blush.
- Yeah. Lives across the street. An eyewitness.

65
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,778
Was she on the street? No, she saw it from
an upstairs window. Eyewitness, though.

66
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,547
You said that, sonny. Did
you get pictures of the body?

67
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,680
Left, right, profile, head-on. Fine, fine.

68
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,224
<i>You actually saw
the murder weapon, Luther?</i>

69
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,226
Yeah, a two-by-four.
I got a picture of it.

70
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,489
Two-by-four?
Yeah! What's up?

71
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,397
Don't bother us now, Calver.
We got a murder on our ha...

72
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,401
Calver!

73
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,734
Calver, what are you
doing here? You're dead!

74
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,707
I knew it. I knew it.
I'm sorry, Chief.

75
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,005
But... I saw you
layin' there...

76
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,911
I want this drunk
thrown in the tank.

77
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,417
Throw me in the tank? She's the one
that hit me! With a board that thick!

78
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,612
What are you tryin' to do?
Make a fool out of me?

79
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,918
You don't need much help,
scoop. Put him in number three.

80
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,958
But you're dead!
I am not.

81
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,618
I saw ya! I did too! You did not!

82
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,718
You didn't. Didn't! Did! Did!

83
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,729
Didn't! Didn't! Didn't!
Did! Did! Did!

84
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,265
All right, you two.
That's enough.

85
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,530
Come on, loved one.
But...

86
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,604
But I got the pictures
and everything.

87
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,610
Luther, from now on,

88
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,078
let Ollie and me run the
paper and write the stories.

89
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,445
You just keep
setting the type. Hmm?

90
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,417
But I was sure...
Good night, Luther.

91
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,750
Nice work... scoop.

92
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,380
Scoop!
Yeah.

93
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,781
Calver looked so natural! I got
to get a new suit for the funeral.

94
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,480
Wonder who done him in? I can't wait
to read the morning paper and find out.

95
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,489
All right, you two guys.
You just better watch it.

96
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,616
You see these two hands?
They're just as hard as steel.

97
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,991
Hey, look at him, Billy Ray. He's a
karate champion. We better watch ourselves.

98
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,259
Go ahead, Luth.
Yeah, do something.

99
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,132
Why don't you run up
an alley and holler "fish"?

100
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,950
Wait. Then, all of a sudden,
in walks Calver Weems.

101
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,683
<i>And Luther says to him,
"Cal, what are you doing here?</i>

102
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,850
<i>You're dead.!"</i>

103
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,052
We shouldn't laugh.
We really shouldn't.

104
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:50,398
<i>You know, he took a close-up of a
two-by-four. Can you imagine that?</i>

105
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,902
Morning, everybody.
Good morning, Luther.

106
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,967
Morning, scoop.

107
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,146
A person is never dead until
their pulse is stopped, Luther.

108
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,846
Mr. Ace Reporter, would you
pass the marmalade, please?

109
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,056
Lay off,
will ya, Ollie?

110
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,751
Oh, now, Ollie,
enough is enough.

111
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,523
I don't blame Luther
one iota.

112
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:22,500
If I'd seen someone laying in front of that
spooky place, I'd think he was dead too.

113
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,561
It's a murder house. I
wouldn't go near there for $100.

114
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,573
I wouldn't go
near there for 200.

115
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,575
Three hundred.
Four.

116
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,577
Five.
Six.

117
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,513
<i>Girls, girls, please.
Anyway, it's a murder house.</i>

118
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,518
Murder and suicide.
Murder and suicide.

119
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,181
Well, thank the good Lord they're
finally tearing that place down.

120
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,316
Tearing it down?
Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,758
Ephraigm Simmons's nephew
came to town two days ago.

122
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,762
Nicholas!
Nick!

123
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,799
Anyway, he's finally getting
the will probated.

124
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,061
I hear he's gonna
bulldoze it to the ground.

125
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,365
Didn't they question him
about that murder at the time?

126
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,803
Mm-hmm.
He was cleared.

127
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,071
I never liked his eyes.
So dark.

128
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,908
His eyes were blue.
Dark eyes.

129
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,005
Girls, really.

130
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,279
All the Simmonses
had the Simmons eyes.

131
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,326
Oh. It's Alma, Ollie.

132
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,593
Tell her I'll be
right out.

133
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,003
- Good morning, Alma.
- Oh, good morning, Mrs. Miller!

134
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,403
He's still eating, Alma. Why
don't you come in for some coffee?

135
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,271
Oh, no, thank you. I'll just
stay out here and get some sun.

136
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,743
Oh. As you wish, dear.

137
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,508
Ooh! Love that print!

138
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,573
Thank you.
I got it at Belson's.

139
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,845
Three ninety-five.

140
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,116
She's an awful sweet girl.
Yeah, she's a good kid.

141
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,283
My niece Malva bought
a print at Belson's.

142
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,793
It was red, and had
yellow flowers...

143
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,352
across the...
the bosoms.

144
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,467
Uh... Would you excuse
me for just a minute?

145
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,305
You know,
I'll never understand...

146
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,572
why old Mr. Simmons
murdered his wife.

147
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,079
Everyone knows
Ephraigm was crazy.

148
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,548
They all had cold eyes
with thin lids.

149
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,677
<i>Toast, please, Ollie.</i>

150
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,687
Mmm, sure.

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,335
Hi, Luther!
Oh! Hi, Alma.

152
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,337
I didn't hear you
come up.

153
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,600
Oh, well, I was just, uh...

154
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,302
Uh... How you doin'?

155
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,006
Fine. I just love
the sun, don't you?

156
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,207
Oh, yeah. Yeah, l...

157
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,046
I've always
liked the sun.

158
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,489
- Love your print.
- Oh, thank you.

159
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,961
Mrs. Cobb's niece Malva bought
a print down at Belson's.

160
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,499
It's red with yellow flowers
across the...

161
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,067
Ooh! Boy, that sun really
beats down on a...

162
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,405
Hi, Ollie!
metal car.

163
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,570
Good morning, Sugar. Boy,
you look like a million bucks.

164
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,774
Thank you!

165
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,081
Oh, Luther. Calver Weems said
not to tell anybody he's dead...

166
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,418
<i>until he says so.</i>

167
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,829
Oh, good morning, Bill.
Good morning.

168
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,202
Oh, good morning,
Eileen.

169
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,871
My, oh, my,
what a lovely sweater.

170
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,813
You know, of all your sweaters,
I love this one the most.

171
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,850
Mr. Simmons is waiting,
Mr. Maxwell.

172
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,409
Hmm?
Oh, oh, yes.

173
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,854
Good morning, Nicholas. Oh,
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

174
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,620
But we had a seance
at the house last night,

175
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,560
and it ran on
until all hours.

176
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,792
It was a surprise seance for Mrs.
Maxwell. Her birthday, you know.

177
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,891
Don't tell me you believe
in that sort of thing, Milo.

178
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,903
Well, it means the world
and all to Mrs. Maxwell.

179
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,303
Did you sign the papers?
Is the title clear?

180
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,671
The title?
Uh, the papers?

181
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, the house.
Yes, the house.

182
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,244
Well, uh, no, no.
As a matter of fact, no.

183
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,478
But, uh, Delroy Flemming promises
to sign the quick deed today.

184
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,645
- That'll be it, then?
- Well, I sign after,

185
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,655
then that should
finalize it.

186
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,021
I can get my bulldozers
in on Monday, then.

187
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,994
Well, now, I don't understand that,
Nicholas. Why bulldoze it down?

188
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,931
If you took it down piece by piece, you
could sell some of that beautiful woodwork.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,333
Your uncle imported all that hand-carved
work. That must be worth a fortune.

190
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,598
I haven't the time. I've
got to get back to Chicago.

191
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,833
Now, you're sure that I
can start on Monday, then?

192
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,935
Well, l... I foresee no
problems, Nicholas. Good.

193
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,111
I don't know. You try and you try
and you try, and what do you get?

194
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,518
Heartaches! Now wait a minute, Luther.

195
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,217
You didn't do so bad. Your
pictures turned out nice.

196
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,193
You had a good murder story
going there.

197
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,628
Only trouble was,
nobody got killed.

198
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,494
Oh, Mr. Boob.
That's me.

199
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,002
B-double-O-B...
boob!

200
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,230
You know why you thought you
saw a murder out there, Luther?

201
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,832
'Cause that's a murder house.

202
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,475
Oh, they can't tear it down too
soon for me, I'll tell you that.

203
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,574
- Tear it down? Who's tearing it down?
- Nick Simmons.

204
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,211
But he can't do that
without the bank okaying it.

205
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,313
He doesn't have clear title to that
property. The bank's got a lien on it.

206
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,621
Well, I guess he's getting
all that cleared up.

207
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,288
Oh. So he's back in town,
is he?

208
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,593
That's what they say.

209
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,124
Oh, Mr. News. I need a
three-inch item for a filler.

210
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,798
"Mr. News."

211
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,511
I'll fill him someday.

212
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,883
So little Nick is finally
getting his way, eh?

213
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,888
What did you say,
Mr. Kelsey?

214
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,083
You know, Luther,

215
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,854
I was working out there
at the time of the murder.

216
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,918
Oh, really?
Yeah.

217
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,464
I was the gardener.
Is that right?

218
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:32,198
Young Mrs. Simmons was a
beautiful, beautiful woman.

219
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,672
Sparkling black eyes
and skin like alabaster.

220
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,710
The old man was crazy jealous.

221
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,802
You know, Luther,

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,281
it was just 20 years ago
this week...

223
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,284
they were both
found dead.

224
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,578
This week? They say what happened was this.

225
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,454
The two of them was in
the master bedroom arguin'.

226
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,688
He was in a jealous rage.
Suddenly he became violent.

227
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,425
Stabbed her right in the throat.
They never did find out what with.

228
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,399
Then he went
completely loco.

229
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,869
He ran up into the tower,
blood dripping from his hands,

230
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,601
and played that
pipe organ of his.

231
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,667
It was midnight, Luther,
and he sat there...

232
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,272
playin' and laughin' and
screamin' to beat the band.

233
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,181
When the music
reached its peak,

234
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,687
he suddenly jumped up and
threw himself out the window.

235
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,585
They say the ghost
of old man Simmons...

236
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,719
still climbs the tower...

237
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,390
and plays the organ...
at midnight.

238
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,399
<i>Luther.!
Aah!</i>

239
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,697
<i>Let's have
that filler.!</i>

240
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,066
Well, me, I just don't happen
to believe in ghosts...

241
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,079
particularly.

242
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,274
You know, Luther,
I got an idea...

243
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,544
how you could write
a story for the paper.

244
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,143
How?
That filler.

245
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,657
I think folks'd be interested in
reading about the Simmons case again.

246
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,252
It bein' the 20th
anniversary and all.

247
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,264
You mean, write my own story
instead of using a standard filler?

248
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,698
Sure.

249
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,292
Do you think
I dare do that?

250
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,395
'Course you do.

251
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,633
You know why?
Huh?

252
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,972
'Cause you got spunk.

253
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,940
You... You know, I guess
I got that from my mother.

254
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,449
She had
plenty of spunk.

255
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,021
All right.

256
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,080
Let's see.

257
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,457
It was just, uh,
20 years ago...

258
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,432
come this Tuesday...

259
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,801
that the bodies of Mr. and
Mrs. Simmons were found.

260
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,638
<i>Mr. Beckett.! Mr. Beckett.</i>

261
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,441
Oh, hello, Mrs. Maxwell.
Oh, it's wonderful.

262
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,709
The whole town's
talking about it.

263
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,684
I mean, the article
on the Simmons mansion.

264
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,687
Absolutely delicious.

265
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,553
Well, thank you. I've had a
lot of nice comment about that.

266
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,388
You know, my group and
I have always felt...

267
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,396
there's a very active spirit
life in that old house.

268
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,399
You mean, spooks?
Ohh!

269
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:19,233
We prefer "manifestations."

270
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,034
Well, keep up the good work.
I must run.

271
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,843
Say, Ollie. Good reaction on that story
on the Simmons place. Do more on it.

272
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,478
Do more? I haven't done anything on
it yet. Nick Simmons won't even see me.

273
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,750
You mean,
you didn't write this?

274
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,954
<i>No, this isn't mine.</i>

275
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,157
My idea was the passing
of a landmark.

276
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,666
Well, if you didn't write
it, and I didn't write it,

277
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,397
who did?

278
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,777
Um, do you know something
about this, Mr. Kelsey?

279
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,305
Oh, what was that? I'm afraid I
wasn't following the conversation.

280
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,613
Oh. This.

281
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,619
Oh, the Luther Heggs story.

282
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,848
Luther!

283
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,619
I should have known
this was Luther's work.

284
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,626
Here, get this.

285
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:20,757
"The horribleness and the awfulness of
it will never actually be forgotten"?

286
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,563
You know, tomorrow night
is the 20th anniversary...

287
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,606
of the murder
and suicide.

288
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,972
We ought to capitalize on it.
Do it with a fresh approach.

289
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,410
I think somebody ought to spend
the anniversary night in the house.

290
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,643
I've got an idea. I think somebody ought
to spend the anniversary night in the house.

291
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,651
Hey, great! Leave it to me. I'll
get in a little before midnight...

292
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,085
No, no.
Not you, Ollie.

293
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,522
What we need is somebody
with a-a wild imagination.

294
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,618
Someone who's a bit
of a coward.

295
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,027
Someone who's
a-a little superstitious.

296
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,066
<i>Luther, you all right?
I'm fine.</i>

297
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,364
Luther! Of course!
But he can't write!

298
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,370
You'll help him.

299
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,870
Uh, Luther?
Oh, yes, sir?

300
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,347
Congratulations on that
filler. It was a great story.

301
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,284
Oh! Well, thank you. I-I
was hoping you wouldn't mind.

302
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,254
We're gonna do
a, uh, follow-up.

303
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,813
Front-page lead, and
you're going to write it.

304
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:26,393
A... A byline for me?
Oh, for gosh sakes!

305
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:31,027
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Oh, you ought to know better than to ask that, Chief.

306
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,231
<i>The supernatural doesn't
bother you? Not a speck.</i>

307
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,831
Uh, do haunted houses
scare you?

308
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,275
They're mortar,
stone and wood.

309
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,610
Well, good, because you're gonna spend
the murder night in the Simmons house.

310
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,048
Alone.

311
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,848
Oh, well, now...
Just a second.

312
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,185
Uh... Uh... What's the
matter, Ace? You scared?

313
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,656
Oh, well, heck, no.

314
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,523
You kiddin'?
It's just that I, uh,

315
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,621
got to check my bowling
schedule and everything.

316
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,757
Oh, well,

317
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,825
you think it over, Luther,
and let us know tomorrow.

318
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,671
This is a great chance
for you, Luther.

319
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,309
Oh, yeah.

320
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:25,015
Why don't you go out there
tonight and just look it over?

321
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,854
Yeah. Maybe
I'll do that.

322
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,487
I mean, after all,
it's only mortar...

323
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,733
Stone...

324
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,792
And wood.

325
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,362
And wood.

326
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,016
Aah!

327
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,257
Luther Heggs.
Nicholas Simmons.

328
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,665
What are you
doing in front of my house?

329
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,671
What are you asking for it? It's
not for sale. I'm tearing it down.

330
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,643
Oh, well, I guess I'll
just have to... build.

331
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,253
Luther! Hi.

332
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,353
Oh, hi, Alma.

333
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,921
Oh, you, you going
to lunch?

334
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,024
No, just on my way in
to have lunch.

335
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,229
Going to have lunch, huh?
Mm-hmm.

336
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,363
Yeah, well...
What time is it?

337
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,373
Hmm? Oh, uh, 12:00.

338
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,104
Yeah, well, that's lunchtime,
all right. Yes, it is.

339
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,742
Why don't we have lunch together? Oh, yeah!

340
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,750
Okay.
Oh, first...

341
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,843
I have to mail this
for Mr. Beckett right away.

342
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,150
I'll get us a booth and order
for you. What would you like?

343
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,384
Well...
Chicken noodle soup.

344
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,723
Okay, fine.
See you in a minute.

345
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,400
I'm having chicken noodle soup with Alma!

346
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,186
Oh, well, this was
the only table left,

347
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,245
but this gentleman
is just about finished.

348
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,688
I'm almost up
to myJell-O.

349
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,522
Oh. Oh, well...

350
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,732
Did you happen to see
yesterday's paper?

351
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,831
Mm-hmm. What did you think of it?

352
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,776
What do you mean? The
story on the Simmons place.

353
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:11,111
Oh, yes, I did see that. That was mine.

354
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,378
Really?

355
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,444
<i>Gee, I didn't know you were a reporter.
I thought you were just a typesetter.</i>

356
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,388
Oh, well, no.
I am now,

357
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,392
yeah, but, I mean,
that's just background.

358
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,655
I'm working my way up. Oh, I see.

359
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,361
I have a certificate from the
Kansas City Correspondence College...

360
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,367
in journalism,
you know.

361
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,165
Rafe Henderson came out
of there, you know. Oh.

362
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:37,766
Who's Rafe Henderson? He's the one that
covered that famous dead whale story.

363
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,540
You know, where that whale washed
up on the beach in San Francisco?

364
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,275
Laid there for three weeks. Ugh.

365
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,715
Oh, I'm sorry.

366
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,712
Oh.

367
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,320
Thank you.
Uh, who gets the soup?

368
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,659
Yours truly.
Oh.

369
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,790
Just put it right there. Okay.

370
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,803
Uh... can you manage?

371
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,862
Oh, sure.

372
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,213
Do you have any more
assignments?

373
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,481
Well, as
a matter of fact,

374
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:29,049
it's just possible that something
very big is about to break.

375
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,097
Don't mention this
to anybody.

376
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,224
I may do a follow-up on
the Simmons story. Ooh.

377
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,134
They want me to spend
tonight in the Simmons house.

378
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,798
It's the 20th anniversary of
their murder/suicide, you know.

379
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,274
I know. Gee, that's
an exciting idea.

380
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,903
You know, even though most people
say they don't believe in ghosts,

381
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,244
it takes an awful lot of nerve to spend
the night in that spooky old place.

382
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,307
Mmm. Spunk.

383
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,548
Are you gonna do it?

384
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,158
Well...

385
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,727
Uh, aren't you through
with yourJell-O?

386
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,132
Hi, baby. Sorry I couldn't
have lunch with you.

387
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,036
Ollie, that's Luther's chair.
Oh, what's the word, Heggs?

388
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,097
You gonna spend the night
in the house or aren't you?

389
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,336
Well, l... I'm giving two
to one all over town...

390
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,177
that you're not gonna do it, and I'm
not getting too many takers either.

391
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,975
Well, I'll tell you something, Ollie. I'm
afraid you're gonna lose a lot of money!

392
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,182
Because come 11:30 tonight,
I'll be there!

393
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,589
Good-bye, Alma.
Put that on my tab.

394
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,786
You haven't got
a tab.

395
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,175
<i>Luther.</i>

396
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,543
Mr. Deligondo is
getting you his flashlight.

397
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,175
He'll, uh... He'll be here
in just a minute.

398
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,654
I was only two blocks away
that awful night...

399
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,661
at my sister Clara's.

400
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:14,529
<i>We were sort oflistening
to the organ, you know.</i>

401
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,127
The midnight bells
were ringing.

402
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,196
I turned to Clara
and I said,

403
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,207
"Clara,

404
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,540
the organ music sounds
strange tonight."

405
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,846
Well, what did
Clara say?

406
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,156
She said,

407
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,658
"Yes, it does."

408
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,797
You know Clara.

409
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,265
Well,

410
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,464
they say there are still
bloodstains on the organ keys.

411
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,472
That's right.

412
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,442
They've never been able to get
them off. And they used Bon Ami.

413
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,480
<i>Everybody says
he still comes there...</i>

414
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,879
<i>and plays at midnight.</i>

415
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,315
Doesn't play as well
as he used to.

416
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,186
You mean, you've
heard him play?

417
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,813
It's time
to go, Luther.

418
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,283
Uh, yeah.

419
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,445
Yeah, well, I'm gonna...
g-go over there now.

420
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,191
Well, uh,

421
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,062
I, uh, I guess
this is it.

422
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,494
I'll s...

423
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,368
Good-bye, Luther!

424
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,618
Uh, well, I'll see you
in the morning.

425
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,714
God willing.

426
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,917
Ollie! I'm just putting your
adrenaline in shape, kid.

427
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,957
Well, my adrenaline is
just fine, thank you.

428
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,891
You're really going in there,
huh? Of course I'm going in there!

429
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,360
What do you think I came out
here for? Not to go in there?

430
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,795
Well, don't get
so excited, fella.

431
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,096
Well, you know why I'm excited?
I'll tell you why I'm excited.

432
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,400
Because of you! That's why I'm
excited. Oh, come on, Luther.

433
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,066
You're scared and you know it. You
want me to go in there with you?

434
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,541
No, I don't want you
to go in there with me.

435
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,408
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't
you? Sharing all the glory.

436
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,779
Well, for your information,
fella, I work single-o.

437
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,875
Just me, myself and I.

438
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,979
Okay, Ace. She's all yours. See you around.

439
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,190
Ollie?

440
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,924
Oh!

441
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,801
<i>Rachel Courier Express.!</i>

442
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,405
My flashlight.

443
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,107
Big ghost.

444
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,143
Boo.

445
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,314
Mrs. Simmons.

446
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,279
<i>Who's there?</i>

447
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,049
Is that you, Ollie?

448
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,250
Ollie, you...

449
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,351
You trying to
scare me, Ollie?

450
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,231
You in that other room there?

451
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,238
You tryin' to scare me?

452
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,207
Darn you guys!
I'll show you!

453
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,549
Holy Toledo.

454
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,198
Blood.

455
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,587
It was terrible!
It was just terrible!

456
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,686
Okay, now, Luther.
Tell us what happened.

457
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,926
It was terrible! It was just
terrible! Oh, no! He's gonna cry!

458
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,092
Now, steady, now, Luther.
Tell us about it.

459
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,227
It was terrible!
It was just terrible!

460
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,534
I'll never get over it
as long as I live!

461
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,699
Hey, great
opening line. Uh,

462
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,472
"I'll never get over it
as long as I live."

463
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,479
Okay, Luther.
Go on.

464
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,481
I got to house...
lightning, thunder...

465
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,676
Swoosh, zoom!
Down coal chute!

466
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,686
"I arrived
at the house.

467
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,246
"Giving careful consideration to
the most advantageous means of entry,

468
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,417
<i>I selected
the coal chute. "</i>

469
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,694
"Once inside,
I had a look around,

470
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,858
"then made myself comfortable
for the night.

471
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:06,664
"Suddenly there was a
strange knocking on the wall.

472
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,137
I remained cool."
I'll bet.

473
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:14,234
"Moving swiftly, I found myself
in the organ loft.

474
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,178
"There it was,
the massive organ...

475
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,685
"shrouded in cobwebs, its
once-beautiful ivory keys...

476
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,916
still covered with the stains
of young Mrs. Simmons's blood."

477
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,924
And they used Bon Ami.

478
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:31,894
"Later, I descended
to the first floor.

479
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,453
"There, I was to see the most
horrifying display of all...

480
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,693
"in this bloody
parade of terror.

481
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,235
"The portrait of young Mrs. Simmons
had been stabbed in the throat...

482
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,329
"with what appeared to be a pair
of gardeners' pruning shears."

483
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,966
You've never seen
anything like it!

484
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,272
I'll talk to you later. Hey, Al!

485
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,404
Run off another 500.
They're selling like hotcakes.

486
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,917
We've made some sort of hero out of Luther,
and that Simmons place is the talk of the town.

487
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,975
Come on.

488
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,968
I'm sorry, Mrs. Maxwell. Nicholas
Simmons gave me strict orders.

489
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,200
No one's allowed
on this property.

490
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:20,471
Mr. Fuller, you don't seem to
understand. We are followers.

491
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,808
We're on the path
of the occult.

492
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,348
I'm afraid you won't find
anything like that around here.

493
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,010
Well, it's obvious
you don't understand.

494
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,576
Our society
is dedicated...

495
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,986
to contacting
the other world.

496
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,356
The Communists?
The spiritual world.

497
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,089
Mrs. Maxwell!
Mrs. Maxwell!

498
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,529
The cosmic
vibrations!

499
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,533
Coming, coming.

500
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,528
Oh, the divine
emanations from it.

501
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,872
Hail, cosmic chief.

502
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:57,710
<i>Taro.! Caro.!
Salamond.!</i>

503
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,011
All right, ladies.
Break it up.

504
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,315
That's it for today. No
demonstrating without a permit.

505
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,821
You have no right
to bar us from this house.

506
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,586
I've got my orders. Then I'll
have those orders changed.

507
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,150
Well, you'd better do it soon.
They're gonna tear it down Monday.

508
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,389
Tear it down?

509
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,627
By whose orders? Nicholas
Simmons, the owner.

510
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,634
Are you sure?
Positive.

511
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,636
This citadel of the divine,
destroyed?

512
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,439
Never!

513
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,037
Milo, look at me
when I talk to you.

514
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,174
Halcyon, I promised
Nicholas Simmons...

515
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,343
that I would clear the title
by the first of the week.

516
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,649
Then you haven't signed
the final papers yet?

517
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,087
Well, no. No, I haven't. Milo,

518
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:44,491
do you realize how long it's been
since we've had a local manifestation?

519
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,828
We always have to go out of town,
as far away as Wooster, Ohio.

520
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,493
Oh, Halcyon... Now, don't
"Oh, Halcyon" me, Milo.

521
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,665
You don't seem to realize
the cosmic importance of this.

522
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,470
Why, this is bigger than the
whispering steeple in Kansas City.

523
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:03,877
It's bigger than the headless
ballet dancer in Dublin, Ireland.

524
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,610
And it's even bigger than
the day our dear Theresa...

525
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:11,212
received that personal message
from Rudolph Valentino in Toledo.

526
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,449
Milo, you will not
sign those papers.

527
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,116
Oh, but dear...
You won't.

528
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,523
But dear...
You won't.

529
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,995
But... I own 51% of the bank stock.

530
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,623
I won't.

531
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,465
Milo, you didn't eat
your tapioca.

532
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,339
No wonder you have
a nervous stomach.

533
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:45,249
What kind of a man runs his
bank on the whims of his wife?

534
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,916
Well, you just don't know
Mrs. Maxwell.

535
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,222
In the name of heaven, man,
I've waited 20 years for this!

536
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,821
Well, she owns 51% of the
bank's stock, for pete's sake.

537
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,162
Don't tell me your wife believes
all that Luther Heggs hogwash!

538
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:01,466
With all her heart. She came home
last night and vibrated for an hour.

539
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,865
Let me get this straight.

540
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,001
You mean, you're not
gonna sign the papers?

541
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,012
Well, l... l...
I just can't, Nick.

542
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,079
All right.
What are you going to do?

543
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,954
When I get through
with Luther Heggs,

544
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,252
nobody will believe him
when he says "Good morning."

545
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,417
Where on earth
is Luther?

546
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,544
He'll be late
for his own speech.

547
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:55,183
Celebrities are never on
time. There's Alma. Hi, Alma!

548
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,956
Hi, ladies.
Have you seen Ollie?

549
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,554
I heard him say
he wasn't coming.

550
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,931
I believe his nose is out of
joint on account of Luther.

551
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,733
Oh! Here comes Luther!

552
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,919
Hi, hi, hi.

553
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,011
Hello. Hi. How are you?

554
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,451
Hello. Hello.
Good to see you.

555
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,499
Uh, hi!

556
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:43,069
- Over here, Luther!
- Oh! Hi!

557
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,439
How are ya?
How are ya?

558
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,444
Mr. Mayor.

559
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,447
All you people who aren't Chamber
of Commerce, clear the table area.

560
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:56,145
Only C of C people here.
Come on. Clear the area.

561
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,316
Clear the area. Oh, no. Not you, Mr.
Heggs. You stay right where you are.

562
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,255
You too, miss.

563
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,794
That's Alma Parker.

564
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,888
I guess, um, being with you
makes me some sort of celebrity.

565
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,297
Well...

566
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:14,235
How are ya? Are you
alone? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

567
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,966
Oh. Well...

568
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,031
Can I have your autograph, Mr. Heggs?

569
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,772
It's not for me.
It's for my father.

570
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:26,145
Sure.
Autograph.

571
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,582
There you go.
He's cute.

572
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,018
Yeah.

573
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,682
I get to feed
the speaker!

574
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,292
That's Loretta Pine.
I know.

575
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,070
I just love good food.
So do I.

576
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,166
Do you?
Uh-huh.

577
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,404
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.

578
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,481
My mother liked good food. Oh.

579
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,416
She always used to say,

580
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,512
"I'd rather eat good food than
bad food any old day of the week."

581
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,954
I guess we're having
lunch together again.

582
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:19,025
Yes, we are.

583
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,003
Would you like to have
lunch some evening?

584
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:29,705
Oh, uh, that is to say, of
course, uh, that would be dinner.

585
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,714
Well, l...
I-I understand.

586
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,842
I understand. You and Ollie and everything.

587
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,909
Not necessarily.

588
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:41,388
Y-You mean,
you and Ollie aren't, uh...

589
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,688
Not as much
as people think.

590
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,253
Oh.

591
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:52,234
Would you like to have
dinner Sunday night? Yeah.

592
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:56,568
<i>Fine. You're okay. You're
C of C. You're okay.</i>

593
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,234
You're C of C.
You're okay.

594
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,278
You're not C of C,
but you're okay.

595
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:07,639
You're C of C,
and you're okay.

596
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,709
You're...

597
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,646
You're not C of C.

598
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,557
I'm Rotary.
Get out of here!

599
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,095
Who are you
shovin' around, huh?

600
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,070
Thank you, Billy
and Norma Jean Wexler.

601
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:37,136
<i>And that concludes the
musical portion of our program.</i>

602
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,705
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

603
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,308
it is a great honor
and a privilege to present...

604
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,787
the head of our Chamber of
Commerce and the mayor of our town,

605
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,790
Carlyle Preston.

606
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,033
Atta boy, Carl!

607
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:07,036
My fellow citizens of Rachel.

608
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,273
Well, the electrician
must be a Democrat.

609
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,651
Atta boy, Carl.

610
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,780
<i>Rachel has been humming
for the past few days,</i>

611
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,518
and I really don't have to
tell you why.

612
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:26,824
<i>There's been an old house
in this town for years...</i>

613
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,888
that, if the truth
be known,

614
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,958
folks have been afraid
to go near.

615
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,732
<i>I know I have.</i>

616
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,640
But one of our very own
had the pluck to go in.

617
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,908
<i>And that name has been
on every tongue.</i>

618
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,542
<i>And the name of that person
who's been on every tongue...</i>

619
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:51,246
<i>is none other than... and I
really don't have to say it...</i>

620
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,414
Luther Heggs!

621
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:33,626
Thank you, Mayor,
and fellow Rachelanians.

622
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:47,702
That electrician
must be a Democrat.

623
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,682
Th...

624
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:01,019
Thank you, M-Mayor,
and fellow Rachelanians.

625
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,821
I am proud
to be here today.

626
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,330
<i>Atta boy, Luther.</i>

627
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,832
Uh, when I was
asked to be...

628
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,632
guest speaker
at this luncheon,

629
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,400
I asked myself this:

630
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,510
"Who are you,
Luther Heggs,

631
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:26,447
to be a guest speaker
at this luncheon?"

632
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,613
I thought about my answer
about being a guest speaker...

633
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,657
for a long time.

634
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,888
Wh-What is
a guest speaker?

635
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,953
Let me clarify this.

636
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,295
I have been called brave.

637
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,734
What is brave?

638
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,795
Let me clarify this.

639
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,774
Of course, we all know
that it is short...

640
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,336
for bravery.

641
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,679
That goes without
even being said.

642
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,878
<i>But it is
also a symbol...</i>

643
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,354
<i>of another thing.</i>

644
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:09,017
It is a symbol...

645
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,921
of doing one's duty...

646
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:17,057
no matter what is
scaring him... personally.

647
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,068
<i>Atta boy, Luther.</i>

648
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,865
Take your World War II.

649
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,672
There were many heroes
in World War II.

650
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:32,738
What were your heroes?
Who were your heroes?

651
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,476
Let me clarify this.

652
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,522
Thank you for having me.

653
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,960
<i>Taro, caro,
salamond.!</i>

654
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,029
Thank you.

655
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,776
Are you Luther Heggs,
1347 Lucerne Road?

656
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,973
You know me,
Lester.

657
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,846
Loved your speech, Luther. Thank you.
What do you want me to write on this?

658
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,478
Nothing. You don't write on a summons.

659
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,352
Summons? Summons? He got a summons.

660
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,789
He got a summons!

661
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,061
Well, exactly what is libel,
Mr. Beckett?

662
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,726
It's when you print an untruth about
someone that damages them, Luther.

663
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,769
Well, who did I damage?
"Whom."

664
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,066
Whom?
The Simmons' family name.

665
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,469
Mr. Simmons.
Room 51.

666
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,432
Step down.
Mr. Heggs,

667
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:59,559
can I have
your autograph?

668
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,628
He wants my autograph.
Sure.

669
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:06,005
Just draw a little
ghost under it there.

670
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,067
Okay.

671
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,643
Thank you.

672
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,525
Gentlemen.

673
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,575
My attorney,
Mr. Whitlow.

674
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,577
Mr. Whitlow.
Mr. Whitlow.

675
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,636
Well, let's get
right down to business.

676
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,681
Heggs, as you know,
I'm suing you personally,

677
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,944
<i>and Beckett, I'm suing
the Rachel Courier Express,</i>

678
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,350
of which you are
editor and owner.

679
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,854
Now, if I win this suit,
and I will,

680
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,083
I'm going to
take the paper.

681
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:57,888
And if I take Beckett's paper, where
are you going to work, Mr. Heggs?

682
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:04,059
<i>I don't know. Chicago Trib,
Pittsburgh Press maybe.</i>

683
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,864
<i>Now, I don't wanna sue and waste
all that time in court,</i>

684
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,370
so I have an
alternative to offer.

685
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,373
Simply publish the fact
that this story is...

686
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,909
a figment of Heggs' imagination
and I'll call off the suit.

687
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,913
<i>What do you say? In other words,
you want a retraction. Is that it?</i>

688
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,712
Exactly.

689
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:26,279
Luther, tell me once more that what
you said happened really happened.

690
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,290
It happened.
The wall did open?

691
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,292
Whoosh, right open.
And the organ?

692
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,294
Played and played
and played.

693
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,660
Nobody at it? Not a soul, just cobwebs.

694
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:39,532
And the shears in the
throat? Shears in the throat!

695
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,798
No retraction.

696
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,342
All right,
we'll see you in court.

697
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,870
Heggs, when I get you on the
stand, I'm gonna tear you to shreds.

698
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,973
Just who do you
think you are?

699
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,678
A little pip-squeak like you
fighting us in court?

700
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,620
Just who do you
think you are?

701
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,623
Drop dead!
That's who!

702
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:05,923
Right, Mr. Beckett? Mr. Beck... Mr.
Beck... Mr. Beckett? Mr. Beckett?

703
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,999
Boy, you should've heard me
telling them off back there.

704
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:15,037
Well, you better save your breath for
the courtroom. You're gonna need it.

705
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,148
Step up, please.

706
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,651
I'm sorry, Mr. Heggs.

707
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,767
Boy, that was just about the
best pounded steak I ever ate.

708
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,743
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Mother
really is a wonderful cook.

709
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,942
Oh, yes, she is.
Boy, a guy could get fat.

710
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:18,696
What was that you just did? Oh,
that was just... That's karate.

711
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,861
I didn't know you knew karate. Oh, yeah.

712
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,805
I've been studying it
by mail for years.

713
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,865
My whole body's a weapon.

714
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:31,777
Well, that's worthwhile. Yeah.

715
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,883
Would you like to sit
down? Oh, sure. Mm-hmm.

716
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,455
It's nice out.
Yeah.

717
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,735
I guess you think I'm worried
about this trial business tomorrow.

718
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,645
Oh, well... Well, it's
all part of the game.

719
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:09,151
A newspaper man has to
do whatever comes along.

720
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,382
Everything will be
all right. You'll see.

721
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:18,857
I've never been on one
of those stands before.

722
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,164
You'll do just fine.

723
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,602
Alma, do you think
I'm crazy?

724
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,867
Luther, what
a silly question.

725
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,602
Well, some people
seem to think so.

726
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,236
You know very well the
whole town is behind you.

727
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,148
Billy Ray Fox
and guys like that ain't.

728
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,380
Well, Billy Ray Fox's opinion
isn't worth a hill of beans.

729
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,881
Hill of beans.

730
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,665
You know something, Alma? What?

731
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,284
A-Alma?
Hmm?

732
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,892
W-Well, the-the thing
is this, Alma.

733
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,294
I mean, well,
you're a darn attractive girl.

734
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:32,027
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, that's okay.

735
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,092
Me, I'm a... I'm a...
I'm a guy...

736
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,196
and, well, I mean...
what I mean to say is...

737
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:41,505
you-you take your average guy
and your above-average girl.

738
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,705
<i>And, well,
the point is...</i>

739
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,841
that people, well...

740
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,715
What I'm trying
to say is...

741
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,484
that average, average is just...
just is darn lucky...

742
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:57,082
to be sittin' on the same porch
with above-average.

743
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,493
And what I mean by that is... Luther.

744
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,828
Are you trying to say
that you like me?

745
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,925
Yeah.

746
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,372
I like you too,
Luther.

747
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:51,444
I'm sorry, folks, I'm sorry,
but the courtroom is all filled.

748
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:55,450
Now let's get this door
cleared, please. Please!

749
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:59,284
Look, here comes Luther!

750
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,331
<i>Go get 'em, Luther.!
Go get 'em.!</i>

751
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,533
Good luck, Luther.

752
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,437
Thank you.

753
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,650
What was that all about?
What?

754
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,588
That cute little nip on
the cheek. What's going on?

755
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,286
You don't own me, Ollie.
You never did.

756
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,295
Oh.

757
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,354
Well, excuse me.

758
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,207
Taro, caro, salamond.

759
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,268
Yeah, that's right.

760
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:00,245
<i>Atta boy, Luther.!</i>

761
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,185
Norman.
Hi, Mr. Springer.

762
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,987
How are you feelin', Luther? Oh, 3-0.

763
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,257
Boy, this place is really buzzin'. Yeah.

764
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,058
Hi, ladies.

765
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,466
Have you got
a clean hankie?

766
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,034
Yeah.

767
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:05,542
This may cost me my job,
but I hope they fry you.

768
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,976
What'd he say?

769
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,077
Uh, nothing.

770
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,582
<i>All rise.</i>

771
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:23,156
Oyez, oyez, oyez. District court
of Rachel County is now in session.

772
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:27,635
Judge Harley Nash presid... It's
all right, Charley, I'm here.

773
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:32,902
<i>All right, you folks, let's have a
little quiet here. Atta boy, George.!</i>

774
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,433
Now, uh, this is
a case of libel.

775
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:41,609
<i>Nicholas Simmons versus Luther Heggs, Miles
Beckett and the Rachel Courier Express.</i>

776
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:45,814
Where's my water, Charley?
Okay, Mr. Whitlow,

777
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:49,221
<i>you can start it up.
Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

778
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,386
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, I intend to prove...

779
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,588
<i>Here's your water, Judge.</i>

780
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,599
Thank you, Charley. Where's
the Bible? I haven't got it.

781
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,228
Haven't you got it? No, I haven't
got it. I left it right here.

782
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,932
Can't run a court without a
Bible. Arnold, you got the Bible?

783
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,307
Oh, thanks, Arnold. Here
it is, Judge. Arnold had it.

784
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,311
<i>Atta boy, Arnold.!</i>

785
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:14,679
Thank you, Tom. All right, Mr.
Whitlow, you can start her up again.

786
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,344
Thank you, Your Honor.

787
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,354
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

788
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:23,984
it is my intent to prove that Luther
Heggs did willfully and with full intent...

789
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,994
<i>concoct and publish
a fabrication injurious...</i>

790
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,587
<i>to the family name of
my client, Nicholas Simmons.</i>

791
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:32,122
I will prove, in fact,
that this fabrication...

792
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,102
is the product of
the imagination of a man...

793
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:39,369
whose dreams and ramblings
are a danger to this community.

794
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:42,434
<i>He's trying to say I'm crazy.
With your permission, Your Honor,</i>

795
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,810
I should like to call my first
witness, Miss Neva Tremaine.

796
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,476
Miss Neva Tremaine.

797
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:52,112
Who is she? She's my
old grade school teacher.

798
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:01,358
Ma'am, just right
up to the stand.

799
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,729
You wanna put your left hand on the
Bible and raise your right hand, please.

800
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,291
You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

801
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,702
so help you God?
Mm-hmm. I do.

802
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:14,471
Charley, your fingernails. I
had a flat on the way to work.

803
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:17,103
Be seated, please.

804
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,909
Would you state your name
and address, please? Mm-hmm.

805
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:24,316
Neva Tremaine, 312 "E"
Street, Rachel, Kansas.

806
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,685
- And your occupation, please.
- Schoolteacher.

807
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,055
Willow Road Elementary School,
third grade, retired.

808
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,594
Was there one Luther Heggs
a student of yours?

809
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,859
Mm-hmm, he was.
Hi, Luther.

810
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,491
<i>How would you describe
Mr. Heggs as a boy?</i>

811
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:42,730
<i>Oh, Luther was
a very good boy.</i>

812
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,069
He got three blue stars
in deportment...

813
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,439
and three gold stars
in penmanship.

814
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,341
<i>How else would
you describe him?</i>

815
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,710
He was painfully thin
and very keyed up.

816
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,877
Would you elaborate on that
phrase, "keyed up"?

817
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,182
Well, let's see.

818
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:02,088
Well, for one thing, he never ate
the crusts on his sandwiches at lunch.

819
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:06,322
I object. I move that that statement
be stricken from the record.

820
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:09,193
A lot of people trim
the crust on their bread.

821
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,495
Young man,
he didn't trim them.

822
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:15,867
<i>He ate the inside out
and left the crust.</i>

823
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,906
Overruled.

824
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,034
<i>And more specifically,
Miss Tremaine,</i>

825
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,238
how else did he behave,
being keyed up, I mean?

826
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,338
His shoes
fell off a lot.

827
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:30,681
But I suppose that could be because
he was so thin and ran so much.

828
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:35,053
- Was he a talkative boy?
- Well, when he had a good story to tell.

829
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,718
And Luther made up
some beauties.

830
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,627
<i>What kind of stories, Miss
Tremaine? Oh, wild things.</i>

831
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,222
Can you recall any
of them specifically?

832
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,427
Well, I remember
he told all the boys...

833
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,562
that he found a real skeleton
in MacQueen's barn.

834
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:55,167
<i>Of a squirrel! A squirrel!
I never said a person skeleton!</i>

835
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,975
<i>Now you just quiet down, Luther, or
I'm gonna have to cite you for contempt.</i>

836
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,916
<i>They were my brother's shoes. That's
why they fell off. Atta boy, Luther.!</i>

837
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,654
<i>Quiet down now, folks.</i>

838
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:14,185
Do you recall any other of Mr. Heggs'
imaginative ramblings, Miss Tremaine?

839
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:17,562
Oh, lots of things.
He told MaryJane Panucci...

840
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,999
that the filling
in his eyetooth...

841
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,037
was a shortwave radio...

842
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:26,165
<i>and he used to get messages
from Admiral Byrd.</i>

843
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:33,309
<i>I only wanted her to like me.
Go on, Miss Tremaine.</i>

844
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,316
Well,
I remember...

845
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,945
I once asked my students to
write a theme called, "My father."

846
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:43,151
And Luther wrote that his father
was really the Prince of Wales,

847
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,785
but that there was
a mix-up at the hospital.

848
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,495
Your witness.

849
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,626
No questions.

850
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:58,139
You can step down now, Neva.
Thank you, Harley.

851
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,141
I hope I helped you,
Luther.

852
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,913
Don't you worry
about a thing, Luther.

853
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:13,421
I've got a surprise
witness coming in.

854
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,457
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'll proceed.

855
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,288
- Your full name, sir.
- Gaylord Patie.

856
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,421
<i>And what is your occupation? I'm a
certified public accountant for the state.</i>

857
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,091
Now, then, I understand
that you, Mr. Patie,

858
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:29,899
have heard the organ playing
in the Simmons mansion.

859
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,906
Am I correct, sir?
You are.

860
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:35,603
I have heard organ music coming from
the tower of the Simmons mansion...

861
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,703
on three
separate occasions.

862
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:43,351
<i>That's why I came
to you, Mr. Springer.</i>

863
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,410
And at what time
did you hear this music?

864
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,979
At the stroke
of midnight.

865
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,390
And what else have you heard coming
from the Simmons mansion, Mr. Patie?

866
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,419
On the first occasion,
a woman's scream.

867
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,262
And on the second and third
occasions, a man's scream.

868
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,805
What kind of screams
were they, Mr. Patie?

869
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,105
Wild, maniacal screams.

870
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,843
<i>Thank you.
Your witness.</i>

871
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:17,443
<i>Mr. Patie, I understand that you're
president of the International Conclave...</i>

872
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,148
For Unidentified Flying
Objects. That is correct, sir.

873
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:23,248
- Where was your last meeting?
- On Mars.

874
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,862
You may step down.

875
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,907
Wait till I get
Heggs on the stand.

876
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,136
Luther Heggs
to the stand, please.

877
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,839
<i>Luther Heggs.</i>

878
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,357
Taro, caro, salamond.

879
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,385
Luther, what is
that all about?

880
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,990
Uh, taro, caro,
salamond.

881
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:10,164
Oh. Well, you lodge women, you
just sit down and keep seated.

882
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,605
All right, Charley,
swear in the witness.

883
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,508
Put your left hand on the Bible
and raise your right hand, please.

884
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,513
You swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

885
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,515
so help you God?
I do.

886
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:24,144
Be seated.
All right, Mr. Whitlow.

887
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,154
<i>Your, uh...</i>

888
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,453
Your full name is Luther Heggs,
is that correct? Yes, sir.

889
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,551
Do you mind if I call you Luther? Fine.

890
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,597
Relax, son.
Oh, I am.

891
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:39,100
I'll try not to keep you on the stand
any longer than necessary, Luther.

892
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:42,228
Oh, I don't mind.
It's all part of the game.

893
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:45,535
What game is that?
The newspaper game.

894
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,873
Oh, I see. You really love the
newspaper game, don't you, Luther?

895
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,937
Yeah, I sure do. I guess if
you cut me, I'd bleed ink.

896
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:55,575
That's very funny.
Thank you.

897
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:59,018
You certainly have a flair for
turning a colorful phrase, Luther.

898
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:04,424
Well... Well,
when you work with words,

899
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,553
words are your work.
Mmm, bravo.

900
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,827
Yes, I expect you learn a good deal about
words down there in that typesetting room.

901
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,527
Oh, I'm just filling in time
in the typesetting room.

902
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:17,504
Oh, I see. You'd do anything to become
a full-time reporter, is that correct?

903
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,508
Well, sure. Who wouldn't?
After all, a chance...

904
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:24,342
Including exaggerating and fabricating,
eh? Gotta be a fool to... What?

905
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:28,349
I'm asking you a question! Can't you
curb your imagination for one minute?

906
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,215
<i>Can't you curb your tongue for
a minute? Atta boy, Luther.!</i>

907
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:35,013
Quiet down.

908
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:39,618
Isn't it true, Heggs, that you were
offered a full-time job as a reporter...

909
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,255
if you brought back a
sensational story from that house?

910
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,629
A story which, in truth, you
made up out of your own head.

911
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,725
No, that's not true.
I saw those things.

912
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,236
- Yes, yes.
- I heard those things!

913
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,034
<i>He heard those things.</i>

914
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,075
Those church bells rang!
Yes, yes!

915
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,135
The organ played!
Oh, yes, it played.

916
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,545
I saw the bloodstains on the
keys, and they're still there!

917
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,811
And they used Bon Ami!

918
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:07,278
- Tell it, Luther! Tell it!
- And when I ran downstairs,

919
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:10,291
I came face to face with
a painting of Mrs. Simmons.

920
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:14,659
There was a pair of garden shears stuck in
her throat, blood gushing from the wound!

921
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,933
Mrs. Maxwell fainted,
Judge.

922
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,903
Some of you huskies
back there pick her up...

923
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,939
and get her out under
a tree or something.

924
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,874
Keep her head up!
Keep her feet up!

925
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,434
No, keep her head
higher than her feet!

926
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,182
Quiet!
Quiet down!

927
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:37,912
<i>Quiet down.!</i>

928
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:40,284
<i>Quiet down here now.!</i>

929
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,258
<i>You listen to me, 'cause I'm gonna
tell you something right now.!</i>

930
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:47,124
I don't know whether
I believe in ghosts or not.

931
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,664
Many the night I've talked
about this with my missus.

932
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:52,826
But I do know, there's only
one way of finding out...

933
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,699
if there's something going
on in that Simmons place.

934
01:12:55,771 --> 01:13:00,231
This court hereby orders the
jury and interested parties...

935
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:05,110
to meet here in front of this
courthouse at 11:30 tonight.

936
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,708
And we're going down to the
Simmons house and see for ourselves.

937
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,720
Court's adjourned.

938
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,139
<i>All right, ladies,
back up now.</i>

939
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,803
Back up, ladies. Back. Back up. Back up.

940
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,814
Okay, Chief, looks like
we're all ready.

941
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,112
Open her up.
All right, Judge.

942
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,279
Judge, you're all right.
You're all right.

943
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:49,950
Good luck, Luther.
Oh.

944
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:53,017
I believe in you, Luther. I
believe in what you stand for.

945
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,029
And my group is
sharing this with you.

946
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,622
And that's
akin to love.

947
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:01,692
Well, taro, caro...
Salamond!

948
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,706
You're coming in with me, aren't
you? I don't think they'll let me.

949
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,710
Come on. You're with me. Okay.

950
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:13,043
She's with me! Luther,
Alma, Kelsey... Kelsey!

951
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,049
Where do you think you're going? Press.

952
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,609
Who do you think you're
kidding? Out! Out! Out!

953
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,681
Sorry.

954
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,928
Uh, I better
go in first.

955
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,304
All right, everybody,
this way.

956
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:44,038
Now let me have your attention
for just one minute.

957
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:48,674
Now I'm gonna take you on a tour
duplicating my movements of that night.

958
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,776
Now you're apt to see some
pretty frightening things,

959
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:55,381
but don't panic, you're
in no real personal danger.

960
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:58,654
<i>Now you ladies of thejury,
stay close together.</i>

961
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:00,661
Hold hands
if you wish.

962
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,221
First, I'm gonna take you into the
den and then up to the organ loft...

963
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,426
Say, isn't that the picture of
Mrs. Simmons you were talking about?

964
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,835
Yeah, well, first I wanna take them
into the den. Well, it is, isn't it?

965
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,840
Where's the garden shears?
Where's the blood?

966
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,842
It seems to me there should
be a hole in it somewhere.

967
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,242
Well, I'm sure
there is.

968
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,572
Let me... I'll just show
you... Well, I mean...

969
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,515
<i>Well, that's funny.</i>

970
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:27,112
Maybe that's not
the same picture.

971
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:32,455
I don't think that's the same
picture. That's okay, Luther.

972
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:36,862
If you've seen one picture of a woman with
shears stuck in her throat, you've seen 'em all.

973
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:40,527
Luther, why don't you start the tour
with the wall that opens. Yeah, yeah.

974
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:45,130
All right, everybody, I'm gonna show you
the wall that opens. The opening wall!

975
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,437
Right this way.

976
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,443
I know what
our trouble was back there.

977
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,776
That happened after the midnight
bells. My mind's wide open.

978
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:57,952
All right, people, in here.
Right in here.

979
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,046
Okay, here it is.
The panel that opens.

980
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,652
<i>Right here it is.!</i>

981
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,025
<i>You're gonna see
the opening panel.!</i>

982
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,793
Now, I was standing
about right here.

983
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,028
I picked up a book...

984
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,036
and I threw it
at the bookcase...

985
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,902
and whoosh, she opened.

986
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:25,039
I-I-I picked up a book...

987
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:28,640
and I threw it,
and whoosh!

988
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,083
Whoosh!

989
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,052
Well, I picked...
picked up a book and l...

990
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:43,026
I-I can't understand it.
It... It opens up!

991
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,658
There's-There's a staircase
in there and everything.

992
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:47,668
He's a real loser.

993
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,500
Luther,
it's almost midnight.

994
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,837
Maybe we better be getting
along to the organ part of it.

995
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,605
But I can't understand it.
It opened right up!

996
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:59,010
Whoosh!
That's right.

997
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:02,847
Yeah. Well... All right, all
right, up to the organ loft!

998
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,476
Come on, folks.
Up to the organ loft.

999
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:07,852
Follow me to the organ loft.
The organ loft is next.

1000
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,521
Now, folks,
it's almost midnight,

1001
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:20,432
and the ghost of Mr. Simmons will be up in
the organ loft in just a matter of minutes.

1002
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,731
All right. Folks, Priscilla
here doesn't want to go up.

1003
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:29,106
<i>Any of you other ladies
feel the same way?</i>

1004
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,509
The men feel
the same way too, Judge.

1005
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,414
Very well. Jury is excused
from going up in the organ loft.

1006
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,578
You can wait down here
for us in the entry hall.

1007
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:16,483
Look, the bloodstains.
That's right. I told you.

1008
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,952
What time you got,
Judge?

1009
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:24,590
It's, uh, just
ten seconds to midnight.

1010
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:28,466
Good. All right,
steady does it.

1011
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,076
Okay.

1012
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:50,215
Here we go.
This is ridiculous.

1013
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,283
Come on now.

1014
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:57,831
Come on.
Come on, baby.

1015
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,833
<i>Come on.!</i>

1016
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:04,167
One and a two and...

1017
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:18,183
Luther, I think
that's about it.

1018
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,153
But... But...

1019
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,215
it played!

1020
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,125
I'm tellin' you,
it played!

1021
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,392
You saw the bloodstains
on the keys!

1022
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,133
It played.

1023
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,603
It played.

1024
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,146
Oh, here they come!
Here they come!

1025
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,745
Make room!
Make room!

1026
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:58,657
Make room. Clear a path here. Clear a path.

1027
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:09,526
Might as well tell these people to go
home, Chief. There's nothing in there.

1028
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:13,040
Just an old empty house. Just imagination.

1029
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,906
All right, folks, break it up.
It's all over.

1030
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,911
Judge says there's
nothing in there.

1031
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,311
Run along home.

1032
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:56,147
Well, we're finished,
Luther.

1033
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,516
You better find yourself
another job.

1034
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,646
I'm sorry, Mr. Beckett.
Couldn't we just...

1035
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:05,352
Please, just leave
me alone, Luther!

1036
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:08,624
Just leave me alone,
hmm?

1037
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,094
Mr. Kelsey!

1038
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,637
You!

1039
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:06,731
I thought this would get
you back in here, Luther.

1040
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:10,676
Where are the others? They
all left. You mean, you?

1041
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,543
It was me playin' the organ
the night you were here.

1042
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,549
I stabbed the painting,
everything.

1043
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:19,178
But when the organ was playing,
there was nobody at it.

1044
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,882
There's a tuning keyboard
under the pipes.

1045
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:24,948
Well...
where were you tonight?

1046
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,119
That dumb Herkie
wouldn't let me in.

1047
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,163
What's this all about?
I don't understand.

1048
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:33,962
That sounds like Alma.

1049
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:41,236
<i>Come on.
No, no.!</i>

1050
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:45,245
<i>One step closer
and I'll kill her.!</i>

1051
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,645
Know what these are,
Mr. Simmons?

1052
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:49,979
<i>That's right.</i>

1053
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:53,851
They're my shears! The ones
you used to kill your aunt.

1054
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,083
And you left them there
to pin it on me!

1055
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,819
I'll kill her, Kelsey!
Now let me out of here.

1056
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:01,123
Won't do you a bit
of good, Nicky.

1057
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,393
Now everybody's gonna know about
this staircase. Your big alibi, Nicky.

1058
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:08,197
It won't help to bulldoze the
house down now! That's far enough!

1059
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,273
You go downstairs
and come up behind him.

1060
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:16,833
How? Push the andiron. It
opens the panel in the study.

1061
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,845
Andiron?

1062
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,343
You killed them both,
didn't you?

1063
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,787
Killed them both for the money
and then tried to pin it on me!

1064
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,791
<i>I'll kill her, Kelsey.!</i>

1065
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,829
Aaah!

1066
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:12,162
Stay out of this, Heggs!

1067
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:14,667
Don't give up now,
Luther. Get him!

1068
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,829
Stay back, Heggs!
Stay back, stay back!

1069
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,271
<i>Get him, Luther.!</i>

1070
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,274
<i>Get him.!
Don't let him get away.!</i>

1071
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,310
I'll kill her,
Kelsey.

1072
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,175
Aaah!

1073
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,043
Alma,
call the police.

1074
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,257
Well, the bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

1075
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:41,489
He's right. I pushed the
andiron, and the wall opened up.

1076
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:44,031
Well, you just better learn to
take the word of the press, Chief.

1077
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:46,726
All right, now let me get
this whole thing straight.

1078
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:50,134
You see, the secret staircase
was Simmons' big alibi.

1079
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,196
That's right.
The big "alibi-rooney"!

1080
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:56,232
That night the old man was up in
the organ loft playing the organ.

1081
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,802
I heard a scuffle coming
from madam's bedroom.

1082
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,747
I saw Nick Simmons
run out of the room...

1083
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:04,307
and head for the organ loft. Topside.

1084
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,444
He didn't see me.
He didn't see him.

1085
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:09,854
I went into the room,
and there lay Mrs. Simmons...

1086
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:12,518
with my garden shears
stuck in her throat.

1087
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:15,188
Here they are!
Here's your murder weapon!

1088
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:18,391
I submit these as exhibit "A."
Watch the prints on those.

1089
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,525
I grabbed those
and put them under my coat.

1090
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:22,536
When the servants
came up the stairs,

1091
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,834
we heard a scream
from the organ loft...

1092
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,999
and the thud of a body
falling into the bushes.

1093
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,738
We rushed over, and there
on the ground below...

1094
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:33,246
lay the body
of old man Simmons.

1095
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:35,305
Dead as a doornail!

1096
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:37,578
We turned, started
down the stairs...

1097
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:40,644
and met Nick Simmons coming up,
like he just come home.

1098
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:44,419
Of course, he'd slipped downstairs
by way of the secret staircase.

1099
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:48,087
How come you took so long to bring
this out in the open, Mr. Kelsey?

1100
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:53,065
I was scared. After all,
that was my shears.

1101
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,068
But this was
my last chance.

1102
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:58,299
Well, that wraps it up.
Take him away, Chief.

1103
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:07,981
You knocked
Simmons out, Luther?

1104
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:12,452
That's right, karate. Made my
whole body a weapon. Good boy!

1105
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,858
Do you, Alma, take this man to
be your lawful wedded husband?

1106
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:27,727
<i>I do.
Do you, Luther,</i>

1107
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,362
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?

1108
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:32,963
I do.

1109
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:35,942
By virtue of
the authority vested in me,

1110
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,535
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1111
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:46,382
Luther, you can
kiss her now.

1112
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,818
<i>Atta boy, Luther.!</i>
