1
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,510
Go back to sleep.

2
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>Once upon a time,
before I came</i>

3
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,380
<i>You cried and cried and
watched TV all day.</i>

4
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,480
<i>Until you were a zombie.</i>

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,410
<i>But then I zoomed down from heaven
through skylight into room</i>

6
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,270
<i>And I was kicking you
from the inside boom boom</i>

7
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,960
<i>And then I shot out onto rug
with my eyes wide open</i>

8
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,780
<i>And you cutted the cord and
said “Hello Jack.”</i>

9
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,120
Ma. I’m five.

10
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,859
- I'm so old now!
- You're such a big boy now!

11
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Yep.

12
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,880
Good morning lamp.

13
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,180
Good morning plant.

14
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,280
Good morning eggsnake.

15
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,810
Good morning rug.
Good morning wardrobe.

16
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,010
Good morning TV.

17
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,010
Good morning sink.

18
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,500
Good morning toilet.
Good morning everyone.

19
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,219
- Ok.
- It's my birthday, I'm five.

20
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,220
I get it.

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,180
- Take your vitamin,
it's the last one.

22
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,580
- Vitamins.

23
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,980
Is bad tooth hurting?

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,160
But you know,
mind over matter.

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,260
If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter.

26
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,620
You're right.

27
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,859
Hey, do you know what
we're gonna do today?

28
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
What?

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,140
We are going to bake
a birthday cake.

30
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,540
- A birthday cake?
- Mhm.

31
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,520
- Like in TV?
- Mhm, but for real.

32
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,440
No way...

33
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,660
At back.

34
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,150
1, 2, 3...

35
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,720
4, 5.
1, 2,... 3, 4, 5

36
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
There you are.

37
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,620
<i>Good night, Dora.
Thanks for helping...</i>

38
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,160
<i>I love you.</i>

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,360
Ok, TV off.

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,140
I'm going to grow and grow
until I'm a giant.

41
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,810
- Look, Ma, I'm stronger than Samson.
- Yeah, you are.

42
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,030
I'm going to be Jack the Giant,
Giant-Killer!

43
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,400
And burst out of skylight
into space with my dog Lucky...

44
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,620
and BOOM BOOM BOOM between
all of the planets.

45
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,650
Get started some stretch.

46
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,390
Good job, good job.

47
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,340
Switch your leg.

48
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,940
- Go on.
- I'm doing it.

49
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,990
- Yeah.
- Get down...

50
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,820
Like a frog.

51
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,720
Feet back and we're
doing push-up down.

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,230
Ok, time for track.

53
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,970
It's this one.
Oh, I meant this wall.

54
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,380
Did I say this one? I meant this wall.
But, actually I meant this one.

55
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,410
But this one, but
this one needs it too.

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
Yeeaahh.

57
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,760
Very good.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,760
- Is that the batter?
- It's batter, we have some butter too.

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,250
Butteeer!

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,060
Yeah, mash that in.

61
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,720
- Hope you got it.
- Why don't you do some of that?

62
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,480
- Can you do that?
- Yep.

63
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,380
- Abracadabra.

64
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,520
- Now the candles!

65
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
We don't have any candles.

66
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
I know.

67
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,219
You said a birthday
cake for real.

68
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,920
That means candles on fire.

69
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,730
Jack...

70
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,340
It's ok without the candles,
it's still a birthday cake.

71
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,520
You should ask for candles for
sunday treat, not dumb jeans.

72
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,750
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,220
You know I have to ask for
stuff that we really need.

74
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,500
Stuff that he can get easily.

75
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,320
But Old Nick gets
anything, by magic.

76
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,570
- Why don't we try
your cake?! - No.

77
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,290
Jack...

78
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,160
- Let's try a bite a bit.
- I said NO!

79
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,090
Come here.

80
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,210
Next week when I'm six...

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,440
you better ask for real candles.

82
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,310
Next year you mean.

83
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,080
<i>And Edmond tears free
out of the bag...</i>

84
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,190
<i>and swims and swims of
the island Monte Cristo.</i>

85
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,740
<i>And he digs up the treasure his
friend was telling him about.</i>

86
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,050
<i>He buys a big yacht,</i>

87
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,170
<i>And sales back to France.</i>

88
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,240
<i>And when he gets there he
decides to buy the island.</i>

89
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
<i>And call himself The Count.</i>

90
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,560
And vows to take revenge on all
of the people that ruined him.

91
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,260
- May I have my birthday cake?
- Tomorrow.

92
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,590
Just a bite.

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,610
- Well you washed
your teeth already.

94
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,810
- One last story? Please.

95
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,820
Come on Jack, it's
late, let's go to bed.

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,210
Sing.

97
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,880
<i>One evening when
the sun went down</i>

98
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,290
<i>And the jungle
fire was burning</i>

99
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
<i>Down the tracks
came a hobo hicking</i>

100
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,980
<i>And he said boys
I'm not turning</i>

101
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,870
<i>I'm headed for a land
that's far away</i>

102
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,420
<i>Beside the crystal fountain</i>

103
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>Oh come with me,
go and see</i>

104
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,900
<i>The big rock
candy mountain</i>

105
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,750
<i>In the big rock
candy mountain</i>

106
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,110
<i>There's a land that's
clear and bright</i>

107
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,820
- Here's the jeans.
- Thanks.

108
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,740
The grapes were way too much,
so I got you canned pears.

109
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,510
What's that? A birthday cake?

110
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,710
You should have told me,
I'd got him a present.

111
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,370
So, how old is he anyway, four?

112
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,500
Five.

113
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,290
1, 2, 3...

114
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,450
<i>There is room,
then outer space.</i>

115
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,810
<i>there's all the TV planets,</i>

116
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,010
<i>then heaven.</i>

117
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,200
<i>Plant is real but not trees.</i>

118
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,470
<i>Spider are real...</i>

119
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,870
<i>and one time the mosquito
that was sucking my blood.</i>

120
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,080
<i>But squirrels and
dogs are just TV.</i>

121
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,420
<i>Except Lucky, he is my dog
that might come some day.</i>

122
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,560
<i>Mountains are too big
to be real and the sea.</i>

123
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,130
<i>TV persons are flat
and made of colors.</i>

124
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,860
<i>But me and you are real.</i>

125
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,140
<i>Old Nick, I don't
know if he's real.</i>

126
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,940
<i>Maybe half?</i>

127
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,210
48, 49...

128
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,610
50, 51...

129
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,550
What is it?

130
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,824
- It's bad tooth.

131
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,200
Can I hold it?

132
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Wow!

133
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,800
You made him gone!

134
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,860
He was alive thing,
he was real!

135
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,630
He would have stolen our food.

136
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,530
Mouse can have my food,
I'm not hungry.

137
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,070
He would've brought in germs,
bit us in our sleep.

138
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,340
Mouse is my friend...

139
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,340
And you splatted
him dead.

140
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,070
No I didn't, he's hunky-dory.

141
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,220
- Are you tricking me?
- No, Jack, I swear.

142
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,550
He's safe at home in
the backyard with his Ma.

143
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,350
What backyard?

144
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,750
Mouse lives in
a yard in TV??

145
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,580
Here you can make
UFO out of this.

146
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,090
Why you didn't tell
Old Nick it was my birthday?

147
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,930
- Because he's not our friend.
- He said he'd bring me a present.

148
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,930
You're not supposed to be listening
to that, you're supposed to be asleep.

149
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,700
- I never had a present.
- Well he didn't mean it.

150
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,670
It might be my dog, Lucky.

151
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,180
Jack, we can't have a dog,
there's not enough room.

152
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,280
Space, there's not enough space,
with the barking and the scratching.

153
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,220
- Lucky won't scratch, he promises.
- There is no Lucky.

154
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,050
- Yes, there is!
- No, there's not!

155
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,360
You made him up in your
head, he's not real.

156
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,400
Jack, I'm sorry.

157
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,700
Come here, I'm sorry.

158
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,670
I'm sorry... You're right,
it wasn't nice.

159
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,730
Where do we go
when we're asleep?

160
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,339
Right here in room.

161
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,600
But dreams?

162
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,340
Do we go into TV for dreaming?

163
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,540
We're never anywhere but here.

164
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Can I open it?

165
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Mhm.

166
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,560
Yeeess.

167
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Why the aliens
never scream back??

168
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,770
Because they still
can't hear us.

169
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,670
- We'll do even louderer, ok?
- Ok.

170
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,750
[PLAYING] I'll kill you!

171
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,120
- Mommy, it's attacking me!
- Oh no!

172
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,950
[PLAYING] Got you!

173
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,860
Ma, what smells bad?

174
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,790
Fuck!

175
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,390
- What's that smell?
- Sorry, I burned some cheese.

176
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,730
I just wasn't thinking.

177
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,440
Well, thinking is not
your strong suit.

178
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I know.

179
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,830
- Yeah.
- Why don't you sit down?

180
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Thank you.

181
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,060
So how did he like his truck?

182
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,130
Yeah?

183
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,060
Yeah... I know boys.

184
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,310
The vitamins?

185
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,880
- Ah, it's the waste of money,
there's nothing in.

186
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,640
- If we had a better diet...
- Oh, fuck, here we go again.

187
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,380
Maybe if you could stop complaining
and be a little grateful.

188
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,230
- Thank you.

189
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,280
- God, like fucking pulling
teeth sometimes.

190
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,110
- Thank you for everything.

191
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,160
- You just have no idea
about the world today.

192
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,890
- No.
- No.

193
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,440
- Who pays the power bill?
Who pays for everything?

194
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,470
- You.

195
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,450
I how do you think I'm gonna
be able to keep doing that?

196
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
- What do you mean?

197
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,070
Nothing.

198
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,270
- No, what did that mean?
- Six months I've been laid off.

199
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,930
Six months.

200
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
Yeah... If you had to
worry your little head?

201
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:46,920
- What are you
gonna do about it?

202
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,900
- Are you looking for a job?
- There are no fucking jobs, Jesus!

203
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,160
- Hey there.
- He's asleep.

204
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,380
I don't think so.

205
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,150
Do you keep him in the closet
all day, as well as all night??

206
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,240
What, the little freak has two
heads or something?

207
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,210
- Hey.

208
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,110
- Hey.

209
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,120
- Shh. - Come to bed.
- Hey, Jack.

210
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,560
- Hey. - Let's go to bed.
- You want some candy?

211
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,330
Do you like candy?

212
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,020
- Come on out and get some candy.
- Come to bed.

213
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
- Please...

214
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,180
- Please?

215
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:47,650
Didn't your Momma ever teach
you any manners, young lady?

216
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,140
Hi son.

217
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,180
Get away from him!
Don't touch him!

218
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,530
Don't touch him!

219
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,410
- Don't touch him.
- Cut the noise!

220
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,080
- No!
- Cut the noise!

221
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Cut the noise!

222
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,400
You wanna breathe?

223
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,700
Yeah? Do you wanna breathe?

224
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,980
Shit, fuck!

225
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,250
Don't touch him!

226
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Fuck!

227
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,540
If you ever touch me
like that again...

228
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,360
If you ever grab me like that
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

229
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,180
- Do you understand that?
- Don't touch him.

230
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,870
Yeah, well you forget
where you got him.

231
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,220
Jack!
Jack!

232
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,880
I'm sorry I came
out of wardrobe!

233
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,120
- Are you ok?
- I'm sorry.

234
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,020
- Are you ok?
- I'm sorry.

235
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,050
- It's ok.
- I won't do it again.

236
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,100
Ma, I'm a dragon.

237
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,310
I'm a dragon.

238
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,080
He cut the power.

239
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,660
<i>For, you see, so many out of
the way things had happened latly</i>

240
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,144
<i>- that Alice...</i>
- "Lately".

241
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:46,239
<i>lately, that Alice had
begun to think that</i>

242
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,130
<i>very few things indeed
were really impossible.</i>

243
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,920
<i>There's seemed to be no use
in waiting by the little door...</i>

244
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Ma...

245
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,260
Hey Jack, do you
remember mouse?

246
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,950
Yeah.

247
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,450
Yeah?

248
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Do you know
where he is?

249
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I do.

250
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,440
He's on the other
side of this wall.

251
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,420
What other side?

252
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,850
Jack, there is two
sides to everything.

253
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,320
Not in octagon.

254
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,710
Yeah...

255
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,530
- But...
- An octagon has eight sides.

256
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,450
But a wall, ok?

257
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,210
A wall is like this.

258
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,110
See, we're on the inside...

259
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,640
the mouse is on the outside.

260
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,700
- In outer space?
- No, in the world.

261
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,940
It's much closer
than outer space.

262
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,070
I can't see the outside side.

263
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,560
Listen, I know that I...

264
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,800
told you somethings else before
but you were much younger.

265
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,019
I didn't think that you could
understand but now you're so old...

266
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,060
And so smart. I know
that you can get this.

267
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,001
Where do you think that
Old Nick gets our food?

268
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,820
- From TV by magic!
- There is no magic.

269
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,490
What you see on TV, those are pictures
of real things, of real people.

270
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,840
It's real stuff.

271
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,080
Dora's real for real?

272
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,400
No, that's a drawing.
Dora is a drawing.

273
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,930
But other people...
They have faces like us.

274
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,400
Those are pictures of real things.

275
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,500
And all the other stuff you see
on there, that's real too.

276
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,490
That's real oceans,
real trees, real cats.

277
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,760
No way.

278
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,570
- Where they all fit?
- They just do, they just fit.

279
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,930
They just fit out in the world.

280
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
Jack, c'mon...

281
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,580
You're so smart. I know that
you've been wondering about this.

282
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,550
Can I have something else to eat?

283
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,480
There's a leaf!

284
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,840
- Do you see that?
- Where?

285
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,850
Look.

286
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,240
I don't see a leaf.

287
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,840
Come here, I want you to see.

288
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,500
Come have a closer look.

289
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,750
You see that? See?

290
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,410
Dumbo Ma, that's not leaf,
leaves are green.

291
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,519
Yeah, on trees, but then they fall
and they rot, like salad in the fridge.

292
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,480
Where's all that 
stuff you said?

293
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,380
Trees and dogs 
and cats and grass?

294
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,820
Well, we can't see
it from here...

295
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:35,120
because the skylight looks
upwards instead of sideways.

296
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,300
You're just tricking me.

297
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,800
No, I'm not.

298
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,410
- Liar, liar, pants on fire!
- Jack!

299
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,079
I couldn't explain it before
because you were too small...

300
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,493
you were to small to understand
so I had to make up a story. But...

301
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,870
But now I'm doing the opposite.

302
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,170
Ok, I'm doing the opposite
of lying, I am unlying.

303
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,170
Because you're five now.

304
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,390
You're five and you're
old enough to understand...

305
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,240
what the world is.
You have to understand!

306
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,930
You have to understand!

307
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,400
We can't keep living like
this you need to help me.

308
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,950
I want to be four again.

309
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,430
Do you remember how...

310
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,380
Do you remember how Alice
wasn't always in Wonderland?

311
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,070
She fell down, down down
deep in the hole.

312
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,010
Well, I wasn't always in room,
I'm like Alice.

313
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,029
I was a little girl named Joy.

314
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,030
Nah...

315
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,670
And I lived in a house
with my mom and my dad.

316
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,909
You would called
them Grandma and Grandpa.

317
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,910
What house?!

318
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,710
A house, it was in the world.

319
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,590
And there was backyard,
we had hammock.

320
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,390
We would swing in the hammock
and we eat ice cream.

321
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,030
A TV house?

322
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,530
No, Jack, a real house, not TV.

323
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,230
Are you even listening to me?

324
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,610
When I was a little older,
when I was 17...

325
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
I was walking home from school...

326
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:50,480
- Where was I?
- You were still up in heaven.

327
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,759
But there was a guy,
he pretended that his dog was sick...

328
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,630
What guy?

329
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,440
Old Nick,
we called him Old Nick.

330
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,020
I don't know what
his real name is.

331
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,904
But he pretended
his dog was sick.

332
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:00,879
What's the dog's name?

333
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,200
Jack, there wasn't a dog!

334
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
He was trying to trick me, ok?

335
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,570
There wasn't a dog,
Old Nick stole me.

336
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,008
I want a different story!

337
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,900
No, this is the story
that you get!

338
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,900
He put me in
his garden shed.

339
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,510
Here. Room is the shed.

340
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,810
He's locked the door and he's
the only one that knows the code.

341
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,090
You know, the secret
numbers that open the door?

342
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,050
He is the only one that knows and
I've been locked in here for seven years.

343
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,680
I've been in here for seven years,
do you understand?

344
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:34,320
This story is boring!

345
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,720
Jack, the world is so big!

346
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,320
It's so big you wouldn't
even believe it.

347
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,140
And Room is just one
stinky part of it.

348
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,850
Room is not stinky,
only when you do a fart!

349
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,700
My God...

350
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,390
I don't believe
in you stinky world!

351
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,970
Ma...

352
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,970
It's warm again.

353
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,770
Ma...

354
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,770
Ma...

355
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,570
Ma...

356
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,940
<i>Eggsnake's our longest
friend and fanciest.</i>

357
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,540
<i>Meltedy Spoon's the best to eat
with because he's more blobbier.</i>

358
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,950
<i>Labyrinth is the twistiest.</i>

359
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,180
<i>And she hides things so I
don't know where they are.</i>

360
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,020
<i>Toilet's the best
at disappearing poo.</i>

361
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,320
<i>Lamp's the brightest except
when the power is cut.</i>

362
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,930
<i>You're the best at reading
and songs and lots.</i>

363
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,360
<i>Except if you're
having a Gone Day.</i>

364
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,670
<i>I'm the best at drawing and jumping
and growing and nearly everything.</i>

365
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,970
<i>[TV] But the turtle is
no longer afraid of that.</i>

366
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,700
<i>She is bigger now and
her shell is much harder.</i>

367
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,260
Are turtles real?

368
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,590
Yeah, they are totally real.

369
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,920
I had a turtle as a pet.

370
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,320
And crocodiles and sharks?

371
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,600
Yeah, they are all real.

372
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,870
Real?

373
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,340
Sort of.

374
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,600
So, these are real people but
they are playing dress-up.

375
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,290
They are pretending that they're
people from hundreds of years ago.

376
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Just TV?

377
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
You're getting it!

378
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,530
When Old Nick comes back,
I'm gonna kick him in the butt.

379
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Let me tell you something.

380
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,610
You know, one time I tried
to kick Old Nick in the butt.

381
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,240
I hid behind the door.

382
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,640
And I was holding the lid
from the toilet tank.

383
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,850
There used to be a lid on it,
it was the heaviest thing in Room.

384
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,660
When he came in
I smashed it on his head.

385
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,590
But I messed up.

386
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,830
He shoved the door closed and
he grabbed me by the wrist.

387
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,050
That's why it's sore now.

388
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,740
We could wait till he's
asleep and kill him dead.

389
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,110
Yeah, we could, but...

390
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,380
Then what?...
We'd ran out of food.

391
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,480
And we don't know
the code to the door.

392
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,480
Hey! The Grandma and
Grandpa could come.

393
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,220
Jack, they don't
know where we are.

394
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,360
Room's not on any map.

395
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,400
Jack, listen to me.
Now we got a chance.

396
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,170
We've nearly missed it
but we got our chance.

397
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,030
So, you're gonna help me.

398
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,620
You're gonna help me
trick Old Nick.

399
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,460
I don't get it.

400
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,250
I'm going to make
your face so hot...

401
00:37:23,322 --> 00:37:26,250
that Old Nick will have to take
you to the hospital in his truck...

402
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,330
and then when you get there you're
gonna say to the doctors, Help! Police!

403
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,410
- Well, maybe next year
when I'm six. - Tonight.

404
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,540
It has to be tonight, Jack.

405
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,340
Tell Old Nick that...

406
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,699
because of the power cut...

407
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,399
you go so cold
that you got fever.

408
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,620
Tomorrow, please!

409
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,840
No, I'm your Ma, so sometimes
I have to pick for the both of us.

410
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,170
It's ok, it's ok,
you gotta stay floppy.

411
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,090
Ok, you stay floppy and
you're not gonna move...

412
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,580
or say a word,
you're too weak, ok?

413
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,980
What are you doing?

414
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,190
What are you doing?!

415
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,030
I'm sorry, I just got
to make you smell sick.

416
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,390
Good, that's good,
show me how...

417
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,520
Show me how you're gonna
pull the note out of your pocket.

418
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:14,320
Show me the note.

419
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,370
Come on, you're
at the hospital...

420
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Show me.

421
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,090
What's this?

422
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,680
What's that?

423
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,510
You see? You got a bit
of me. All the time.

424
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,590
Ok, you put it back
in your pocket..

425
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,220
Good, good, ok.

426
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,220
And you gotta be strong too.

427
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,010
Ok?

428
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:40,070
- I'm scared.
- I know.

429
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Come on.

430
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
It's ok.

431
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,600
- There you are!
- You know the drill.

432
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,170
- Not a peep till the door is shut.
- Sorry, just...

433
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Jack's sick.

434
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,150
It was so cold.

435
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,119
- Well, you brought
that on yourself.

436
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,120
- Well, I couldn't keep him warm,
and now he's burning.

437
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,090
- Give him some of
those painkillers.

438
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,790
- I've tried, but he just
keeps puking them back up.

439
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,600
Don't! Don't you...

440
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,210
Stay still?

441
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,080
Jesus, he's on fire.

442
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,510
Ok, I'll get him
something stronger.

443
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,930
But he... he's five,
he's dehydrated, he has fever.

444
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,420
He could go into
convulsions any minute.

445
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,060
- Just shut up and let me think.
- He needs antibiotics.

446
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,000
Ok, alright, I'll get him
something tomorrow night.

447
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,400
No, you need to take him
to the E.R. right now.

448
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,800
- Stop the hysterics!
- I'm begging you!

449
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,040
Am I still gonna go?

450
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,410
No, not this time.

451
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
It's ok.

452
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,920
Do you remember how...Edmond
pulls his friend out of the bag?

453
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,210
And hides in.

454
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,930
And then he gets in the bag.

455
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,400
And he lays in there really
still until the guards come.

456
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,720
Cause that's what
you're gonna do.

457
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,960
You see? How that's even tricksier
than pretending to be sick.

458
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,530
Because you're gonna...

459
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Play dead.

460
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,580
Folding over.

461
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,450
- I don't want to be dead.
- You're just pretending to be dead.

462
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Stay stiff.

463
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,160
We're gonna roll you up in rug
so that Old Nick won't see you.

464
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,730
Won't see that
you're alive inside.

465
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,630
Old Nick is gonna pick you up.
This, stay stiff, stiff, stiff.

466
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,830
And you're not gonna be wobbly
and floppy this time...

467
00:42:20,835 --> 00:42:21,970
you're gonna be real stiff.

468
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,840
Like, like a robot.

469
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Now shake.

470
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,780
So, that's what
it will feel like.

471
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,156
And that's when you'll know
that Old Nick's driving.

472
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,170
That means he's busy and so
it's time for you to roll.

473
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,850
And you're not going
to make a sound.

474
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,899
And I'm going to be there in your
head talking to you all time.

475
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,640
Roll, roll, roll. Now
wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!

476
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,240
- I can't, stop!
- Come on, Jack.

477
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,630
- Ma, I can't!
- Ok.

478
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,930
And Old Nick's gonna come and
he's gonna pick you up with rug...

479
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,430
and he is gonna
take you outside.

480
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,470
And he's gonna put
you in his truck.

481
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,620
And he's gonna....
find a place to...

482
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,530
To...

483
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,610
Lay you down.

484
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,210
No.

485
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,310
But it'll be ok though.

486
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,120
Cause you're gonna wriggle out,
and you're gonna run away.

487
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,180
Hands like this.

488
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,420
Ok, too many turns, that
time will shorten the rug.

489
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,330
Ok.

490
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,640
Roll, roll, roll, roll, Jack!
Roll, come on, roll.

491
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,410
- You got it, wriggle, wriggle, yes!
- I hate you!

492
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,660
Ok, ok.

493
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,500
Truck, wriggle out, jump, run.

494
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
You will jump...

495
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,919
Jump when you hit
the first STOP sign.

496
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,230
When truck rolls to a stop.

497
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,580
You're gonna shout
when you see somebody.

498
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,140
You say "my Ma is Joy Newsome"!

499
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,490
- Who is Somebody?

500
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,650
Anybody, it's the first
person that you see.

501
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,420
- An actual real alive person?

502
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,390
What if Old Nick unwraps me?

503
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,850
He won't.

504
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
You got bad tooth?

505
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,970
He's in here so
I don't lose him.

506
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,720
You're amazing.

507
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,880
You're gonna love it.

508
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,770
What?

509
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,490
The world.

510
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,780
My house with the hammock.

511
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,910
And Grandma and Grandpa.

512
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,580
And you?

513
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,190
Yeah.

514
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Stay stiff.
Sorry, Jack.

515
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,230
Stay stiff.

516
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,290
- You can do this.
- Antibiotics.

517
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,430
What are you doing?

518
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,220
He got worse in the night.

519
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,270
He didn't wake up.

520
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,860
Ah, geez...

521
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,440
Poor girl.

522
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,940
- Well, I guess it must have
been pretty serious.

523
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,440
- You killed my baby.

524
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,900
Ok, take it easy, ok,
let me have a look.

525
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,270
- Don't touch him!
- Ok.

526
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,860
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure?!?.

527
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,760
- Well, he can't stay
here, you know. - No.

528
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,160
- Where are you gonna take him?
- I don't know.

529
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:16,970
I'm thinking...

530
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,210
- Somewhere nice.

531
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,740
It can't be here,
I'll feel him.

532
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,960
- Ok.
- Somewhere with trees.

533
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,430
Trees, sure, yeah.

534
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,200
I want you to swear to me you won't
even lay your filthy eyes on him.

535
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,960
Swear to me that
you won't look at him!

536
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,430
I swear.

537
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,680
- Ok, we still got an hour
till dark. - Now!

538
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,820
- Now! I can’t bear it.
- Alright.

539
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,370
- Gentle please!
- Ok.

540
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,250
- Please, please!
- I got him.

541
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,020
- Please gentle.
- I got him, I got him.

542
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,600
Step back.

543
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,350
Face the wall..

544
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,680
<i>Truck.</i>

545
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,220
<i>Wriggle out.</i>

546
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,770
<i>Jump.</i>

547
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,820
<i>Run. Somebody.</i>

548
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,420
God.

549
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,080
Fucking bitch.

550
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,530
- Boomer!

551
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,250
I'm really sorry man,
she just came out of nowhere.

552
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,740
Hey, hey! I'm really sorry.

553
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,780
- Is your little girl ok?
- It's under control.

554
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,700
Has she been in some kind of accident?
Would you like me to call in someone?

555
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,920
- Help!
- I'll take care of it.

556
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,150
- What's that you got there, honey?
- Come on.

557
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,570
- Is that for me?
- Come on.

558
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,890
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

559
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,420
- Ma, help me!
- I'm calling the cops, mister.

560
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,160
Come here, sit.

561
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,160
Hi, honey.

562
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,880
<i>This is Boomer, he's not
gonna hurt you.</i>

563
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,880
<i>You hold on, I'm
gonna call somebody.</i>

564
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,480
<i>It was red pickup, she was running
away from this guy who grabbed her.</i>

565
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
<i>- I tried to stop him.
- Thank you.</i>

566
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,870
Hey, hey there.

567
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,020
I'm officer Parker.
Can you tell me your name?

568
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,920
Hi.

569
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,170
- Jack.

570
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,780
Can you say that
a little louder for me?

571
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,920
Ok.

572
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,530
So...

573
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,250
Do you have another name...?

574
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,670
Jack?

575
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,670
Ok, it's ok.

576
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,590
Can you tell me
how old you are?

577
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,810
- I'm five.
- Five.

578
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,520
That's great, ok.

579
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:40,940
Now...

580
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,980
Can you tell me
where you live?

581
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,000
Why don't we call
child services?

582
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,430
Do you have a mom, Jack?

583
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,820
Ma.

584
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,160
Ok, good. Does she
have another name?

585
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,460
- I can't remember.

586
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,580
Where is Ma right now?

587
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,460
- Room.
- What Room?

588
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,700
Jack, where is this Room?

589
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,709
That guy with the truck,
is that your dad?

590
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,220
Is that Ma's boyfriend,
do you know him?

591
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,480
What's that, Jack?

592
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,060
- A bit of Ma.

593
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,740
That's ok baby. That's good.

594
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,560
Thank you, Jack, that's good,
you did real good. Ok?

595
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,550
So Jack, anything recognizably?

596
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,700
Jack, anything?

597
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:55,180
Your room, Jack.
What's outside the room?

598
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,160
- Space.

599
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,150
No.

600
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,230
- The world. - You think
the kid's on something?

601
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,430
- Ok, listen, when you
step out the door...

602
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,960
- No, no, you don't?
- We don't know to open the door.

603
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,090
- My money's on 
some kind of cult.

604
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,440
The tooth, the long hair.

605
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,320
Is there daylight
in your room?

606
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,370
- Ok, good, how many windows?
- Zero.

607
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:24,990
- Well then how does the sun come in?
- Through skylight.

608
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,570
Skylight? Ok, excellent, so..

609
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,820
- You live in a house
with the skylight?

610
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,720
- Room's not a house.

611
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,910
Ok.

612
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,400
- It's a...
- Yeah?

613
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,248
You'll get more out of him
after he's had some sleep.

614
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,350
- Tom, give it a second.

615
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,040
- Room's a...a shed.

616
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,180
- A shed?

617
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,380
Jack, a shed?
Ok, good boy.

618
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,890
That's a needle in a haystack.

619
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,130
Ok, listen to me.

620
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,930
What made you jump
out of the truck, Jack?

621
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,370
Ma said my head.

622
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,840
Ok. What exactly did she say?

623
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,650
Jump when it slows
down, but I couldn't.

624
00:55:59,655 --> 00:56:01,460
Alright. So what did you do?

625
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,720
What did you do?

626
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,960
Third time, I got banged.

627
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,170
The third time of what, Jack?

628
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,800
Third slow,
everything went sideways.

629
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,639
And then it stopped...

630
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,120
- And I jumped...
- I got it.

631
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,610
I got it honey, I got it.

632
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,390
- 54O9 call.
- [PD] <i>Go ahead.</i>

633
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,270
Dispatch, listen carefully,
wa have a rough location.

634
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,910
South on Elm, three stop signs
past the junction with Beach...

635
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,190
Look for a garden
shed with a skylight.

636
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,530
Also check the most recent
satellite images for...

637
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,620
a red pickup in the driveway.

638
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,179
- 54O9 over.
- Unbelievable.

639
00:56:37,183 --> 00:56:38,250
[PD] <i>Ok, copy that 54O9.</i>

640
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,730
Good work, Jack.

641
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,730
[PD] <i>Anything is possible,
we got a hostage situation.</i>

642
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,230
Stay with the kid.

643
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,220
Everything is gonna be ok,
Jack, just settle in.

644
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,500
- Hey Parker. You'll
need help out here?

645
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,020
- Is he inside?

646
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,570
- I think not.

647
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
Ma!

648
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,960
Ma!

649
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,630
Ma!

650
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,780
Ma!

651
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,070
Ma!

652
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,170
Open the door. Open!

653
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,780
- Jack! Where have you been?
- Ma, I'm in the world!

654
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,990
Ma!

655
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,150
Can we go to bed?

656
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,300
Yeah.

657
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,920
They'll take us
somewhere to sleep soon.

658
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,410
No, but bed...

659
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,790
In Room.

660
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,850
Ma, Maa!

661
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,660
Good morning, sleepyhead.

662
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,190
I was waiting so long for you
to wake up I fell asleep again.

663
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,290
Are we on another planet?

664
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,990
Same one, just
the different spot.

665
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,520
This one is...

666
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,570
A bedroom, in a hospital.

667
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,580
Are we sick for
real or pretend?

668
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,430
We're not sick. We're
the opposite of sick.

669
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:51,850
How long are we staying?

670
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,670
Not long.

671
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,940
Grandma saw us last night...

672
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,460
and she's gonna get us
once they say we’re OK.

673
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,290
And Grandpa?

674
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,110
He was away for work, but he’s
on a plane coming back home..

675
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:08,190
I wet the bed before,
I'm sorry.

676
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,140
- Yeah?
- It was by accident.

677
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,360
That's ok.

678
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,640
Hello?

679
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,180
Yeah.

680
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,590
Just now.

681
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,590
Yeah, that would be great.

682
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,860
Can you bring it
in 20 minutes?

683
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,210
Ok, thank you.

684
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,800
Step out.

685
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,000
Ok.

686
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,000
- Ma, that's waste.
- We'll get you a new ones.

687
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,070
- For sunday treat?

688
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,780
There will be so many treats,
and not just on sunday.

689
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,520
Ma, where's the bath?

690
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,380
There's a shower,
it's splashier.

691
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,560
Jack, come here.

692
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:06,470
That's us.

693
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,680
Ma, will he find us?

694
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,860
No.

695
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,660
He will never find us.

696
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,850
Come on.

697
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:25,310
Bath before bed,
that's the rule.

698
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,670
There are no rules, Jack.
We can do what we like.

699
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:35,360
- Are you hurting?
- No.

700
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,130
You wanna come in?

701
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,070
Ma, the door is ticking.

702
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,110
Hey, it's ok.

703
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,440
- Good morning.
- Hi.

704
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,930
It's ok. Come on.

705
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,670
- So, we're all awake now?
- Yeah.

706
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,670
- Just put it over there.
- It's ok, Jack.

707
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,700
- Hi, Jack.

708
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,380
How you doin'?

709
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,070
My name is Dr. Mittal,

710
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,600
and you were asleep when
I showed up this morning.

711
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,590
- You hungry?
- Do you want some breakfast?

712
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,969
Yeah, you must be starving.

713
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,570
He's gonna bring
you some breakfast.

714
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,600
Check out what we got,
it's pancakes and fruit.

715
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,260
Let's check it out...

716
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,690
Pancakes.

717
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,330
It's really good.

718
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:42,220
Really, really good.

719
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,670
You wanna try it?
It goes with syrup too.

720
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,280
- Everything's looking good.
- You wanna try syrup? It's very sweet.

721
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,890
So,

722
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,450
I brought you some goodies.

723
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,560
- Sunglasses.
- Ok.

724
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,390
That will make you more comfortable
if you need to go outside.

725
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,300
And sunscreen,
that's for him mainly.

726
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:07,760
- This is important, that's for Jack.
- Is that really necesarry?

727
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,840
Well, there's a lot of germs in the air
that he still needs to get used to.

728
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,990
And my colleague prescribed...

729
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,220
this for your pain
for you wrist...

730
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:18,220
until they can get you
set up for surgery.

731
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,369
And that's to help you sleep.

732
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,190
- Just take it a few.
- Ok.

733
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,620
Thank you.

734
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,520
Come on, Jack,
let's try some pancake.

735
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,190
So have you had a chance to think
about what we discussed this morning?

736
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:35,220
Yeah, I did think about it,
thank you, but...

737
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,600
I really want to go home.

738
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,600
Ok.

739
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,480
- You know my view.
- Yeah.

740
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:50,800
With everything you
two experienced and just...

741
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,360
- Assess Jack properly.
- But nothing happened to Jack.

742
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,160
- I understand.

743
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,060
- He's gonna be ok, right?

744
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,490
The most important thing you did,

745
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,840
was to get him out
while he’s still plastic.

746
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:09,680
- what?
- I'm not plastic.

747
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,980
What's that, Jack?

748
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:15,170
He says that he's real,
he's not plastic.

749
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:17,220
Well you got me there, Jack.

750
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,850
You're real,
and you're very brave.

751
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,280
- Let's talk about
this later. - Dad?

752
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,890
Dad!

753
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:32,829
I'm sorry, we just
couldn't wait any longer.

754
01:07:32,835 --> 01:07:34,930
That's ok, don't
worry about it.

755
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,400
Hello, Jack, thanks for
saving our little girl.

756
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,710
<i>I've been in
the world 37 hours.</i>

757
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,080
<i>I've seen pancakes
and the stairs.</i>

758
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,720
<i>And birds, and windows
and hundreds of cars.</i>

759
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:13,010
<i>And clouds and police
and doctors.</i>

760
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,780
<i>And Grandma and Grandpa.</i>

761
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:19,030
<i>But Ma says they don't live together
in the hammock house anymore.</i>

762
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,720
<i>Grandma lives there with
her friend Leo now.</i>

763
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,380
<i>And Grandpa lives far away.</i>

764
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,770
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

765
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:35,070
<i>I've seen persons
with different faces</i>

766
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:39,220
<i>And bigness and smells
talking all together.</i>

767
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,850
<i>We are getting unconfirmed reports that
an individual has just been arrested.</i>

768
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:47,290
<i>The world's like all TV planets
on at the same time.</i>

769
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,949
<i>So I don't know which
way to look and listen.</i>

770
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,550
I just wanna come home.

771
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:56,110
<i>There's doors and more doors.</i>

772
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:59,640
<i>And behind all the door
there's another inside.</i>

773
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,440
<i>And another outside.</i>

774
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,340
<i>And things happen,
happen, happen,</i>

775
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,680
<i>it never stops.</i>

776
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,760
<i>Plus...</i>

777
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:14,420
<i>the world's always changing
brightness and hotness.</i>

778
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:18,400
<i>And there's invisible
germs floating everywhere.</i>

779
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,020
<i>When I was small I only
knew small things,</i>

780
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,130
<i>but now I'm five
I know everything.</i>

781
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,760
- We're walking out on this?
- Come on sweety, it's ok,
just pick him up.

782
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,090
- Come here, Jack.
- <i>We love you, Jack.</i>

783
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:52,110
Mrs. Newsome, Channel 5.

784
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,060
Don't worry, they will
get bored quickly.

785
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,100
The back of the property
is screened very well.

786
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:05,049
We're taking care 
where necessary.

787
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,839
So if you keep the front
drapes closed...

788
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,400
- We're home now.
- You can keep privacy.

789
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,729
We'll be outside if
you need anything.

790
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,430
Alright, thank you,
thanky you so much.

791
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,279
Your father is still
talking to a lawyer.

792
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,600
You wanna take 
your shoes off?

793
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,330
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

794
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,980
Let's check out downstairs.

795
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,280
You can do it.
One way in.

796
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:32,310
That's good, come on,
one step at the time.

797
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,140
- Ok, one more.
- Hello.

798
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,890
Welcome home honey, I'm
very very happy to see you.

799
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,320
- Me too.
- Jack,

800
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,520
- This is Leo.
- Hey, there sport.

801
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,770
Leo's been our friend
since your mom was little.

802
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:52,230
- Jack. Come on.
- It's ok, it's alright.

803
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:55,080
- It's alright, sweety.
- I'm sorry.

804
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:56,690
Jack.

805
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:03,680
- So what can I get you?
Anyone hungry?

806
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,750
- We have everything.
- Yeah, people have been so kind.

807
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,270
Hey, Jack, would you
like something to drink?

808
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:13,880
Jack,

809
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,030
Grandma asked you a question,
if you want anything?

810
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,560
You hungry?

811
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:20,410
Juice.

812
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,550
He would like some juice.

813
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,139
- Please.
- Ok.

814
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,570
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

815
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,880
- How about you?
- I'm ok.

816
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,750
Hey, you know, when Grandma asks
you a question, you can answer her.

817
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,210
You don't need to say
everything to me, ok?

818
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:43,110
- Ma?
- What?

819
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,510
What are those?

820
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,550
Those are toys,
gifts for you.

821
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,339
From people that
are very happy...

822
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,350
that we got home safe.

823
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,800
What people?

824
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,040
Just people.

825
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:17,890
Where's ice cream
in the hammock?

826
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:23,380
I don't know,
we'll get that later.

827
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,770
What is that?
Let me se that.

828
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,219
- Where did you get this?
- Down there.

829
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,520
Just in case.

830
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,840
Do you have a dog?

831
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:40,550
It's Leo's dog, Seamus.

832
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:44,520
- He’s on furlough at the moment,
with a pal of mine out of town.

833
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,200
Living the country life.

834
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:48,000
- You know, people at
the hospital said...

835
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,710
to avoid pets until your immunity
is back up and there's so much...

836
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,710
What?

837
01:12:53,711 --> 01:12:58,020
- The lawyer said they're expecting
a plea but we can’t rule out a trial.

838
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,199
He wanted to get into everything,
and I said "Not today".

839
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,040
Good.

840
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,900
- I made it clear there'd be
no further contact.

841
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,420
No statements.
To respect our family.

842
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,660
Ah sorry, I'm sorry.

843
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,750
- Can I get you a drink, Bob?
- Thank you.

844
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:18,590
- Scotch... whatever you have.
- Sure.

845
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:26,020
- Sweety, is there
anything you'd like?

846
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,020
Or like to do...or?

847
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:33,740
You got it, you got it.

848
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:36,440
Come on.

849
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,800
Yeah...

850
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,090
This is your Mom's room, Jack.

851
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,890
Hey.

852
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,690
Maybe tomorrow we can cut
that hair. What do you say, Jack?

853
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,420
- Ma.
- What?

854
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,610
That's true.

855
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:19,310
He says that’s
where his "strong" is.

856
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:20,930
Yeah.

857
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:30,020
Maybe I'll just let you rest.
We'll see you downstairs.

858
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,870
- We'll be downstairs, ok?
- Ok.

859
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:42,340
- It's really good, Nancy.
- You wanna try some?

860
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,540
It's apples,
you like apples.

861
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,010
- How about some
ice cream, Jack?

862
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,180
What do you say?

863
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,340
Thank you.

864
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,999
You know, you can say
it louder than that.

865
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,089
Thank you.

866
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,690
- It's ok.
- Thank you for being polite.

867
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,350
Leo?

868
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:23,120
- Ice cream hurts.
- You got a brain freeze there, Jack.

869
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,040
Just eat it slower, ok?

870
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:42,040
I think I'll turn in.

871
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,010
Is there something wrong?

872
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:51,280
- No. - Why are you
in such a hurry?

873
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:54,070
It's been a big day.

874
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,050
- You haven't said
one word to Jack.

875
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,750
Joy. Joy.

876
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,760
We don’t have to talk
about this now.

877
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,520
God.

878
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,190
Yes we do, Dad.

879
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,090
Look at him.

880
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:25,370
Dad.

881
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,380
- Robert.
- Please.

882
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,680
Dad.

883
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,970
I'm sorry.

884
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:38,580
I'm sorry, I can't.

885
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,199
- We're out of here.
- Robert...

886
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,400
- Joy...
- Just spit out, let's go.

887
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,719
- We're going to bed.
- No.

888
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,540
Joy, don't!
Joy! Robert.

889
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,710
Where's Grandpa?

890
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,380
He had to go
home for a while.

891
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,980
You want to play with
some of those toys?

892
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:45,090
- You know who that is?
- This, that's you.

893
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,920
Yeah, that's me.

894
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,360
And Stacy Benton.

895
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,890
And Heather Noel
and Laura Sullivan.

896
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,420
We were on
the relay team.

897
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:02,780
I was the anchor.
I was really fast.

898
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:05,770
We did track.

899
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,710
Real track?

900
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,890
On a field.

901
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,840
- You know what happened
to them? - No.

902
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,170
Exactly.

903
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,800
Nothing. They just lived their
life and nothing happened.

904
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:07,400
Jack, get away
from the window.

905
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,030
Jack?

906
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:15,650
So, the other thing that
we need to discuss is...

907
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,460
some sort of media strategy.

908
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,340
We're not ready for
talking like that, not yet.

909
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,750
Ok.

910
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:27,889
There's gonna be expenses within
forward and a prime time interview...

911
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:31,280
just one prime time interview
means a lot of money.

912
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:49,400
Ma, how long are we
gonna be here for?

913
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,610
This is where we
live now, Jack.

914
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,479
As much information
I could give in.

915
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,070
I'm sure Nancy
knows more.

916
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,590
I'll get her to call you
as she gets home.

917
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,540
- Thanks.
- Thanks again.

918
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,340
Ok. So...

919
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:14,430
What am I gonna do now...?

920
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,020
What if there's anybody
around that would...

921
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,740
play with me here...

922
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:22,060
talk to me.

923
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,730
I guess not.

924
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,050
I'm pretty hungry.

925
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,270
Oh, I know! Got something
in the kitchen I think.

926
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:38,130
Oh yes, I got something very
tasty in the kitchen, I think.

927
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:41,040
Let me see...what's here.

928
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,360
Hello.

929
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,960
I didn't know
you were up.

930
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,920
Pretty good, am I right?

931
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,610
I like this kind, too.

932
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:15,310
Kind of sweet,
but pretty good.

933
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,010
You really have a dog?

934
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:27,960
I do.

935
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,290
Named Seamus.

936
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,070
He's very small.
Not very smart.

937
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,120
You should meet
him sometime.

938
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,100
He'll shake your hand.

939
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:49,200
I had a dog once named Lucky.

940
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:51,260
- But he wasn't real.
- Yeah?

941
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,140
He lived in Room.

942
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,300
So you got some
fluffy cloud in the sky?

943
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,520
- Mhm.

944
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,930
Looks like a nice day.

945
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,420
Which one of
these guys is you?

946
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,410
That guy?

947
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,780
And who is this?

948
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:21,470
- What is that?
- It's a whale.

949
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:25,620
This guy sees blood under
the ice so he wants to go diving.

950
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,690
- I'm sorry.
- Oh?

951
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,780
It's ok, don't worry
about it. Let her rest.

952
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,880
- I'm almost done here.
- Ok.

953
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,160
<i>I'm really looking forward to see
how this masterpiece turns out.</i>

954
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,970
- Don't worry about it.
- Just couldn't come down.

955
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:44,330
<i>- It's perfectly normal.
- She's not talking.</i>

956
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,250
<i>It's understandable. It's gonna
take time for her to heal.</i>

957
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,630
<i>She's been home what, 10 days?</i>

958
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,890
Jack, can you go
downstairs, please?

959
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,590
Now.

960
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:28,150
Jack!

961
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,510
Come here.

962
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:35,340
Look, you have
all these toys.

963
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,490
I don't want them.

964
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,511
Any kid would be so
happy to have these...

965
01:24:39,514 --> 01:24:41,350
and you barely
even touched them.

966
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:43,740
Try the legos. See this?

967
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:52,200
Put these together like this,
you see how I'm doing it?

968
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:54,200
Try it.

969
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,200
Is it fun?

970
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:07,510
Jack.

971
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,850
Can you say something?

972
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,630
Jack!

973
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:15,529
He needs to play
with something real.

974
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:17,570
I'm worried about him
being on the phone.

975
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:20,260
- He's doing fine.
- Well...

976
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:23,639
I didn't give him my phone so I'd appreciate
if you didn't give him yours...

977
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,320
Ok, I won't.

978
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,480
Great.

979
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,800
I just want him to connect
with something.

980
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,140
Joy...

981
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:43,480
Joy, he's really doing fine.

982
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,780
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

983
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:50,700
I was supposed to be happy.

984
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:54,150
- You just need to rest, ok?
- No, I don't!

985
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,140
- I don't need to rest!
- But the doctor said...

986
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,449
That's not what the doctor said,
you don't know what he said...

987
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,119
because it was
confidential conversation.

988
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,140
- You don't know what he said!
- Alright, alright, alright.

989
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,179
You're impossible
to talk to right now.

990
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,180
Well sorry!

991
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:08,000
- No, no you're not sorry!
- Yeah, I'm not sorry.

992
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,669
You have no idea what's
going on in my head.

993
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,310
- Yeah, well try me.

994
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:13,910
I have asked you.

995
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,040
And then what, then every time you
look at me that's all that you see?

996
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:20,710
When I look at you Joy,
I will see my daughter.

997
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:22,580
You don't need me.

998
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,810
You've been doing
just fine without me.

999
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,580
How can you say that?

1000
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:34,869
Do you think that you're the only
one who's life was destroyed?

1001
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,290
Actually, that's
exactly what I think.

1002
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,899
Yeah, how would you feel if
somebody took Jack away from you?

1003
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,640
- Oh shut up!
- Go easy.

1004
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,750
Look at him!

1005
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:44,410
You should be
thinking about him.

1006
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,840
Don't you tell me how
to look after my son.

1007
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,820
I'm sorry that I'm
not nice anymore.

1008
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:53,899
You know what, maybe if
your voice saying "be nice"...

1009
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,469
hadn't been in my head, then...

1010
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:59,290
maybe I wouldn't have helped
the guy with a fucking sick dog!

1011
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,640
Stay there, Jack.

1012
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,640
I'm calling
the fucking lawyer.

1013
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,220
I can't stand this place.

1014
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:28,190
<i>Isabelle, so what are we
thinking for the walk and talk?</i>

1015
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:32,848
And I want you to know that
you guide this interview, ok?

1016
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,969
So, what you feel comfortable
with, you talk about it.

1017
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:37,619
And when you don't,
you just say...

1018
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,944
"not comfortable" and we
move on to another question.

1019
01:27:39,945 --> 01:27:41,770
- Ok.
- And I'm gonna, you know..

1020
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,220
My lawyer said that's...

1021
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,350
- You're good.
- Thanks.

1022
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,580
Did you ever think you
could see this house again?

1023
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,119
I hoped.

1024
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,270
- You hoped?
- Yes.

1025
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,159
<i>And did you think about
things from his childhood?</i>

1026
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,370
It's time to go down downstairs,
Jack, remember what your Mom said?

1027
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:24,140
- I think we got hot.
- Yeah, the lights.

1028
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,160
The lights will
get very warm.

1029
01:28:38,118 --> 01:28:42,638
Listening to you I'm sure you
must have felt at times as if...

1030
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,390
God had deserted you.

1031
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:50,850
- In those very black moments...
- Yeah.

1032
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,330
Did you consider taking your
own life, just to escape.

1033
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:56,949
- I'm getting a feeling my client...
- It's ok.

1034
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:58,750
- I'm ok. - Can you give
her a minute, please.

1035
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,569
I'm fine, can I just
have a tissue?

1036
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,900
Of course, can we get
her a tissue, please.

1037
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,070
- Here you go. - Hard to talk.
- I'm sure.

1038
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:11,120
- Sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

1039
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,280
Nobody's expecting you to be.

1040
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:16,740
You know, the pillar
of strength. You can cry.

1041
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,290
You know, why don't we just go on to
the next question, would that be ok?

1042
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,090
Do you want to put your tissue,
maybe under your chair.

1043
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,100
Yeah.

1044
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:30,210
- There you go.
- Ok.

1045
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:35,300
- Good.
- Ok.

1046
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,780
So...

1047
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,180
When Jack came along...

1048
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:43,140
was it different for you then?

1049
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,040
When Jack came
everything was different.

1050
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:51,650
He was so beautiful... and...

1051
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,300
I just knew that I had
to keep him safe.

1052
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:00,870
Of course, of course.

1053
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,310
When he's older...

1054
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:08,170
will you tell Jack
about his father?

1055
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,330
Jack's not his.

1056
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,470
He's not his? So are you saying
that there were other men?

1057
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:16,800
No.

1058
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:18,830
No.

1059
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:25,670
A father is a man
who loves his child.

1060
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:29,860
Of course, that's so true
in very real sense, but the..

1061
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:35,040
- The biological relationship...
- But that's not a relationship.

1062
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:41,030
Jack is, is nobody's but mine.

1063
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:53,080
- When he was born, did it,
did it ever occur to you...

1064
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,658
to ask your captor
to take Jack away?

1065
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,199
Away?

1066
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,879
Well, to take
him to a hospital, say...

1067
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,250
Leave him there
where he could be found.

1068
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,300
Why would I do that?

1069
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:11,430
- So Jack could be free.

1070
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,550
Now, this is the ultimate
sacrifice and I understand that...

1071
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:21,140
but did you think about him
having a normal childhood?

1072
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:25,800
- But he had me.
- Of course he did.

1073
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:30,850
But, was that the best
thing for him?

1074
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:34,990
Ma?

1075
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,440
Ma?

1076
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:00,440
Ma!... Ma!

1077
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:03,040
- Jack, what is it?
- Ma! Ma!

1078
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:05,070
- What, what?
- Ma! Ma!

1079
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:10,290
Joy! Come here, Jack,
come here, come here!

1080
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,040
- Call 911.
- Ma!

1081
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,700
I'm here, my sweety.

1082
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,540
Bye.

1083
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,130
Hello?

1084
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,610
Hi.

1085
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:19,780
How she doin'?

1086
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,030
He's upstairs.

1087
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,320
Jack...

1088
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:33,660
Come on.

1089
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,380
Phone's for you.

1090
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:57,690
- Say hello.
- Hello.

1091
01:34:57,810 --> 01:35:00,350
<i>Jack, Jack?</i>

1092
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:03,600
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Ma.

1093
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:06,990
<i>- How are you doing?</i>
- Come back.

1094
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,240
<i>I can't just yet.</i>

1095
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,260
Come back now!

1096
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,020
<i>I'll be there soon, I just have to
be here just a little while longer.</i>

1097
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:17,000
I pick, I pick
for both of us.

1098
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:19,310
<i>Jack?</i>

1099
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,200
<i>Leo?</i>

1100
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:51,180
<i>There's so much of
place in the world.</i>

1101
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:57,689
<i>There's less time because
the time has to be spread...</i>

1102
01:35:57,690 --> 01:36:01,010
<i>extra thin over all
the places, like butter.</i>

1103
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,919
<i>So all the persons say
"hurry up, let's get going".</i>

1104
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,830
<i>"Pick up the pace,
finish up now".</i>

1105
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:25,799
<i>Ma was in a hurry to go
boing up to heaven...</i>

1106
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,010
<i>but she forgot me,
Dumbo Ma.</i>

1107
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,170
<i>So the aliens threw
her back down, craaaaash....</i>

1108
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,160
<i>and broke her.</i>

1109
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:15,010
Ok.

1110
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:20,010
You good?

1111
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,340
- Can you help me carry a bag
of groceries? - Yep.

1112
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,959
- Is that ok?
- Yep.

1113
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:34,540
Ok, cool, thank you.
It's light.

1114
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,440
Alright.

1115
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:41,390
- You've been shopping...

1116
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:43,770
We're making cupcakes.

1117
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:47,440
- Have a good day.
- See you.

1118
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,860
You ok? Come on.

1119
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,170
- You're really good at that.

1120
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,170
- I did before, in Room.

1121
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:07,450
You did? Wow.

1122
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,800
- What else did you do there?
- Lots of stuff.

1123
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:15,320
Sometimes I miss it.

1124
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:19,570
Wasn’t it awfully small?

1125
01:38:20,690 --> 01:38:22,339
It went every direction,

1126
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:25,330
all the way to the end.
It never finished.

1127
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,190
And Ma was always there..

1128
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,890
But it was small in wardrobe.

1129
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:44,090
- What did you do in wardrobe?
- Sleep.

1130
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,580
When Old Nick came.

1131
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,510
I want to see Ma.

1132
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,620
Yeah, I know.

1133
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:58,910
She just needs to be
on her own for a while.

1134
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:04,320
Jack, there’s someone here
who’d like to meet you.

1135
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:08,990
Oh, Jack, here, let me
get this for you.

1136
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,990
Come on, lets go see.

1137
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:22,960
Jack, meet Seamus.

1138
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:25,120
Would you like
to pet him?

1139
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:52,700
Here you go, shake him again,
makes him feel good.

1140
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,109
Makes him feel good?

1141
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:56,810
Yeah, makes him feel good,
he should try that.

1142
01:39:58,230 --> 01:39:59,290
He's moving.

1143
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:49,730
Grandma?

1144
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:52,530
- Yes?
- I need the scissors.

1145
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,680
- What for?
- For cutting my hair.

1146
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:01,350
- Do you really want to do that?
- I want to send it to Ma.

1147
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:03,410
How come?

1148
01:41:03,508 --> 01:41:05,510
She needs my strong
more than me.

1149
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:08,490
So I want to send it to her.
Or you could take it to her.

1150
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:15,540
- I can help you if you'd like.
- Yes, please.

1151
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,150
Ok.

1152
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:18,370
Ok!

1153
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:20,491
Let's do this right.

1154
01:41:20,528 --> 01:41:23,670
I have been wanting to cut
that hair for a very long time.

1155
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:25,580
Come on.

1156
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,810
I used to cut your mother's
hair all the time.

1157
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:32,060
And your grandpa's.
I hope I still got it.

1158
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,260
Do you think
this will work?

1159
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:37,110
Can my strong be
her strong too?

1160
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:40,060
Of course it can.

1161
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,810
We all help each
other stay strong.

1162
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,150
No one is strong alone.

1163
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,728
You and your mommy, you help
each other through, don't you?

1164
01:41:49,798 --> 01:41:50,650
Yep.

1165
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:55,410
You and me. You and Leo.
And Leo and me.

1166
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:56,990
We all have the same strong.

1167
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,640
I guess we do.

1168
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,400
Alright...

1169
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,290
Are you ready?

1170
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,050
Steady.

1171
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:25,260
Here, see?

1172
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,460
See?

1173
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,260
What do you think?

1174
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:44,501
It can get through
in my eyes.

1175
01:42:44,513 --> 01:42:46,720
No there's a towel right
there if you need.

1176
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,850
- And my mouth.
- Yeah.

1177
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:53,590
This is the best part.

1178
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:57,830
- It feels good?
- Yeah.

1179
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:00,230
Oh God.

1180
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:03,350
Let's see.

1181
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:10,760
There.

1182
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,800
I love you, Grandma.

1183
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:22,830
I love you too, Jack.

1184
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,420
I'm sorry, Jack.

1185
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,140
That's ok.

1186
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,970
Don't do it again.

1187
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,580
I promise.

1188
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,090
Are you better now?

1189
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:13,710
Yeah, I'm starting to be.

1190
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:31,800
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

1191
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:40,270
Grandma brought this to me.

1192
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,640
I knew that
I could get better.

1193
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,900
You saved me.

1194
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:53,110
Again.

1195
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:59,010
- Can I...?
- No.

1196
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:03,350
There's no more left, sorry.

1197
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,360
Ok.

1198
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:20,370
I'm not a good enough Ma.

1199
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:23,100
But you're Ma.

1200
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:32,480
I am.

1201
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:38,010
I am.

1202
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:46,540
I’m going to play with
Aaron now, he's my friend.

1203
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,160
Ok.

1204
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:04,520
<i>When I was four I didn't
even know about the world.</i>

1205
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:08,390
<i>And now me and Ma are going to
live in it forever and ever.</i>

1206
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,380
<i>Until we're dead.</i>

1207
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,320
<i>This is a street in a city in
a country called America.</i>

1208
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:24,900
<i>And Earth, that's a blue
and green planet...</i>

1209
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:29,420
<i>always spinning so I don't
know why we don't fall off.</i>

1210
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,000
<i>Then there's Outer Space,</i>

1211
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:34,570
<i>and nobody knows
where's heaven.</i>

1212
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:46,979
<i>And Ma and I have decided that
because we don’t know what we like</i>

1213
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,340
<i>we get to try everything.</i>

1214
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:56,840
<i>There are so many
things out here.</i>

1215
01:47:57,720 --> 01:47:59,860
<i>And sometimes it's scary</i>

1216
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,860
<i>but that's ok.</i>

1217
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:06,110
<i>Because it's still
just you and me.</i>

1218
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,370
Can we go back to Room?

1219
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,780
Jack.

1220
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,190
Just for a visit.

1221
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:30,930
Watch your step.

1222
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:40,980
- Is this Room?
- Yeah.

1223
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:45,740
Has it gotten shrinked?

1224
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:48,080
Where is everything?

1225
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,640
Taken away for evidence.

1226
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,290
Proof that we were here.

1227
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:24,150
This because door's open.

1228
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:29,070
What?

1229
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:32,170
It can't really be Room
if door's open.

1230
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:37,050
Do you want me to close it?

1231
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:41,150
No.

1232
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,870
Jack, can we go?

1233
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:55,560
Bye plant.

1234
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,860
Bye chair No.1.

1235
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:02,490
Bye chair No.2.

1236
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:05,250
Bye table.

1237
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:09,730
Bye wardrobe.

1238
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,570
Bye sink.

1239
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:23,640
Bye-bye skylight.

1240
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:29,180
Ma, say bye-bye to Room.
