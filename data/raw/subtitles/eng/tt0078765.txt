1
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,604
Nice doggygy.

2
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,276
Excuse me, madam,
your dog almost bit me.

3
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,448
Excuse me. Madam,
your dog almost bit me.

4
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,951
Nonsense. The dog is a puppy.

5
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,301
How we doing in New York
today, Mr. Elliot?

6
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,836
- Up a point.
- Great.

7
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,639
Early to rise certainly
pays off, huh?

8
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,675
Why, last week alone, we, uh...
Quiet, Harry.

9
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,768
Mr. Flowers.
Good morning, Greta.

10
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,737
Mr. and Mrs.
Polk are here.

11
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:35,941
They've just charged 21,000 deutsche mark
o on their American Success credit card.

12
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,244
We discovered they have
no means of paying for it.

13
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,481
Oh, we dididn't men to wake you up,
Mr. Flowers.

14
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh, no, I was just concentrating.

15
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,817
That'll be all, Greta.

16
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,389
Please, sit down.

17
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,064
I see you two have
had quite a trip, huh?

18
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,334
The Palace Hotel
in St. Moritz,

19
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,902
the George V in Paris.

20
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,272
It totals 12,000 francs.

21
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,409
I see you took the bridal
suite, is that rightht?

22
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,577
Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,550
And it says here that we
canceled your card 10 days ago.

24
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,886
How've you managed
to live sisince then?

25
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,157
Well, we've had to sell almost all of our
clothes and souvenirs that we bought.

26
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,125
All except this here pair of shoes.

27
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,432
Genuine alligator.

28
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,904
But they won't take
'em back if you ever wear 'em once.

29
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,809
You do realize that you
could go to jail for this.

30
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,411
I don't think that'd be fair.

31
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,348
What she means is back in Colby...

32
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,050
Colby?
Yeah, Colby, Kansas.

33
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,986
Colby's up in the northwest
corner of Kansas.

34
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,924
Well, they got this filling station
there with all these application forms,

35
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,426
a whole stack of 'em
by the cash register.

36
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,963
It says, "Don't go with cash,
go with American Success."

37
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,832
So we filled one out.

38
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,134
Sure enough they sent us this card.

39
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,470
You only live once,
Mr. Flowers.

40
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,238
We didn't want to skimp on this.

41
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,675
It's our second honeymoon.

42
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,482
Oh, what's the use, honey?

43
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,051
We'll take our medicine.

44
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,620
Now wait. Mr. Polk.
Yes.

45
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,423
I'm going to arrange coacach
passage for you back to Kansas

46
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,592
where you can take this up
with our local representative

47
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,494
who issued the card
in the first place.

48
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,532
I want you to just tell
them what you told me.

49
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,603
But won't you get into trouble?

50
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,037
No. Not really.

51
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,007
I married the boss' daughter.

52
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,174
<i>Guten Morgen.</i> Mrs. Heinemann,
may we have a word with you?

53
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,976
Yes, Ernst.
Good morning.

54
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,379
Sorry to disturb you, but...
He's done it again.

55
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,514
Done what? Who?

56
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,882
Harry Flowers.

57
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,286
He has let our people go.

58
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,889
Be calm, gentlemen.
You may speak to me one at a time.

59
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,424
But not both together

60
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,427
so that I may understand you.

61
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,263
Harry Flowers was just given
the case of Mr. and Mrs. Polk.

62
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,699
We, the Security
Operations Department,

63
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,335
were ready to close in on them
for abusing their card.

64
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,537
But Flowers let
them go. Hmm.

65
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,906
With no penalty,
no arrest, nothing!

66
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,577
Once more, Herman,
and I'll ask you to leave.

67
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,347
Mrs. Heinemann,

68
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:06,084
Harry Flowers has just
allowed two credit card felons

69
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,987
to escape Munich with no
restrictions whatsoever.

70
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,289
21,000 deutsche mark.

71
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,239
He's been following them day and night.
His nerves are shot.

72
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,509
I'll see that Mr. Elliot
hears of this.

73
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,645
We've nothing against
Harry Flowers personally.

74
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,547
I quite understand.

75
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,483
Thank you.

76
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,656
Nasty man.

77
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,258
Bitch!

78
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,132
<i>Mr. Flowers.</i>

79
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,037
<i>Mr. Flowers!</i>
It's me.

80
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,007
<i>Mr. Elliot would like to see
you. He said pronto.</i>

81
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,910
Right.

82
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,749
Pronto.

83
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,253
Uh, is it the Lone Ranger's friend?

84
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,689
No, that is the
father-in-law.

85
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,593
Heigh ho, Mr. Elliot.

86
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,495
Nature will deceive us, Harry,

87
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,133
so that our senses may grow keener.

88
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,541
You, for example,
are not what you appear to be.

89
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,811
Now admittedly you are a
fairly attractive young man.

90
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,713
You come from a good background,

91
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,450
college, family, et cetera.

92
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,054
You live in a house
a prince would envy.

93
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,356
You have a department
here at Amsucco.

94
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,058
You married my little girl.

95
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,430
You know how to dress,
you know how to walk and talk,

96
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:02,167
in short you have everything
a young man could want to have

97
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,071
except an instinct for survival.

98
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,142
Fate has dealt me a low
hand with you, Harry.

99
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,812
You're a loser.

100
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,751
I gave my only daughter to a loser.

101
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,055
Don't take the man's job, Harry.

102
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,374
Venison is on the menu,
but we don't recommend it.

103
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,678
The duckling<i> a la orange</i> is very good
today as is the<i> cote de veau.</i>

104
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,414
What was that you said before?
Before what, sir?

105
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,649
Well, you said something
that sounded like steak.

106
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,552
I do not think so, today, sir.

107
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,089
Forget the steak.
Animal protein,

108
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,792
too much animal protein will make
you go blind and impotent.

109
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,394
Would you be so kind, <i>monsieur,</i>
we'll both have the

110
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,530
steamed vegetables with
hollandaise sauce.

111
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,732
For two?
And to start?

112
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,968
Oh, I'd like those little sausages.

113
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,471
We'll both have small salads.

114
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,939
And to drink?

115
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,542
I'll have a vodka gimlet.

116
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,179
Liquor? I think a
nice dry wine.

117
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,880
Le Petit Rothschild '32?

118
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,449
Excellent.
Very good, sir.

119
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,653
You're not eating meat
at home, are you?

120
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,122
- No, not really.
- Cut it out.

121
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,459
I don't want Sarah loaded with
animal proteins or dairy products.

122
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,828
They clog up the
intestines with mucus.

123
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,464
How is she by the way?

124
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,798
Sarah? Oh, she's fine.

125
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,301
Totally dependent little girl.

126
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,707
Been thinking about taking her to
Baden-Baden for a few days rest.

127
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,678
Maybe if she was left alone.

128
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,714
If she were left alone,
I'd give you a kick in the pants.

129
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:35,453
By the way, I had the Polk couple
arrested at the airport.

130
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,490
This company will not assume what
must be a government expense,

131
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,558
the transportation of criminals.

132
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,193
They were just using their card.

133
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:46,131
I don't want the
embarrassment of firing you.

134
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,569
I should never have been involved
in this at this level anyway.

135
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,672
That's why I'm going to put you
where I can keep an eye on you.

136
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,643
Where is that?
At the top.

137
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,647
I'm promoting you next month to General Manager
of Foreign Corporate Transfer Division.

138
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,151
What's that?
I don't know yet.

139
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,835
Heard you're stepping
up the corporate ladder.

140
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,937
Like father-in-law
like son-in-law.

141
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,042
Is that jealousy I hear, gentlemen?

142
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,944
Jealous?

143
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,613
I'd puke first. I'd vomit.
I'd cut my wrists first.

144
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,148
Herman.
I'd decapitate myself.

145
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,283
Shh, shh.

146
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,086
Flowers,

147
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:47,392
we'd just like to be in on it,
when one of ours makes good.

148
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,961
Don't worry,

149
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,431
you will be.
Excuse me.

150
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,401
<i>Danke.</i>

151
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,381
So, Sarah is totally
dependent, huh?

152
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,484
Well, get this, you chubby,
fat-faced pompous bore.

153
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,890
Your daughter is not helpless.

154
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,292
She's spoiled.

155
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,162
You're too blind to see it.

156
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,968
You talk to me as if I'm her,
her babysitter or something.

157
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,604
I'm... Thank you.
I'm her husband.

158
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,374
I'm in love with her.

159
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,178
I mean, you give her chocolates,
servants, ponies, a summer house.

160
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,580
A TV set for every channel.

161
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:46,251
You put lollipops and ice
cream where her mind should be.

162
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,620
It's a wonder she grew up to
speak or think at all!

163
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,288
Harry. Harry!

164
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,123
Yoo-hoo.

165
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,862
Hi.
What are you doing here?

166
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,831
I'm a snow bunny.

167
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,400
You're gonna be a stewed one,
if we don't get out of here.

168
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,175
Sarah, please,
let's... Let's leave.

169
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,380
How rude.
Sarah.

170
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,482
I ought to sock you right in the jaw.
No.

171
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,567
What ya doing that for?

172
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,836
Just testing.

173
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,738
Testing what?
Your new coat.

174
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,374
It's not my coat, Harry.

175
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,578
It isn't Friday and you know it.

176
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,780
But it's almost Friday.

177
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,082
It is not. Stop it.

178
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,584
Harry, it's not Friday.
Now put your clothes on.

179
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,292
Sarah, I'm going to look
like the butler in this.

180
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,696
Oh, you'll look wonderful.
It goes with my coat.

181
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,265
Now put your clothes on.
We're almost there.

182
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,294
Shall I take your coat?
No, I will keep it on.

183
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:22,340
Gunter, you evil man, corrupt me.

184
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,177
Sorry, I'm Mr. Nice Guy.

185
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,219
I've made a
mistake. Excuse me.

186
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,621
No, I can handle it.

187
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,456
Yes?

188
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,627
No, this is too much for you.

189
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,797
Well, maybe
the cane'll
bring me luck.

190
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,202
Yes, maybe.

191
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,604
If you were a
different person with it.

192
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,641
Gunter!

193
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,310
I want my Gunter.

194
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,979
What have you done with him?

195
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,924
Sarah?

196
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,337
If I were a different person.

197
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,089
Psst.

198
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,482
Good day, may I be of service?

199
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,585
Oh, yes. I'm interested
in a nose.

200
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,287
What sort of nose?

201
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:00,424
Oh, ordinary at first glance,
but then a touch of menace.

202
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,459
Menace.

203
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,665
What about ears and eyebrows?

204
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,003
What shall I it be, sir?
You inquired
about noses.

205
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,509
Oh, actually, I, uh,
want an entire face.

206
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,012
My own is beginning to bore me.

207
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,580
Huh.

208
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,520
That nose is most becoming.

209
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,191
I think it looks like
a crook's nose.

210
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,327
A crook's? Not at all.

211
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,096
I want a crook's nose.

212
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:43,701
It would belong g to a thief,
I think, looking more closely.

213
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:49,040
No, this is going to
call for something
more than a nose.

214
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,878
Can you make me my own face?

215
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,782
It requires a fitting.

216
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,962
Ah, perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
WrWrap it up.

217
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,075
Sarah!

218
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,643
Sarah!

219
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,178
Sit!

220
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,019
Madam,

221
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,489
that is a dangerous animal.

222
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,359
What are y you, a
mouse? Or a man?

223
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,265
Sarah, I'm home.

224
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,105
Sarah?

225
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,525
Hi. I'm taking pictures
of my fairy dress.

226
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,595
Your father wants us to go
see<i> Swan Lake</i> tonight.

227
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,765
Tell him I don't want to.
I want to take pictures.

228
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,803
I'll take myself out
to dinner then.

229
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,972
That'll be nice.

230
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,249
Hey, you want Cook
to cook you something?

231
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,359
Sarah?

232
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,130
Sarah, wake up
for a second.
Wake up, wake up.

233
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,135
Just lift your arm if
you can hear me.

234
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:17,041
Sarah, I'm going to
have to keep
talking so eventually...

235
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:22,813
Good. Listen, when
your father comes
to pick me up

236
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,283
tell him I I had to go
to the dentist. Okay?
It's an emergency.

237
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:37,428
There's two months in
advance, and a nice piece
of change for yourself.

238
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,832
No, go ahead, keep it.

239
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,835
If I want ya, I'll find ya.

240
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,805
If you got any friendly
neighbors, keep
'em away, huh.

241
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,508
And don't bother cooking me
breakfast, I eat breakfast
before I go to sleep.

242
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,511
Thank you, sir.
Don't mention it.

243
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,812
Huh!

244
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,485
Ah!

245
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,790
Hey there, Scarface.
You almost scared
the hell out of me.

246
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,228
Okay, Mr. Elliot.

247
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,967
So Harry Flowers is a loser, huh?

248
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:55,372
Well, if it's appearances
you want, it's appearances
you'll get, buster.

249
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,407
<i>♪ Falling in love again</i>

250
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,477
<i>♪ Never wanted to</i>

251
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:37,314
<i>♪ What am I to do
I can't help it</i>

252
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,418
Don't you think you've had enough?

253
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,520
No.

254
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:49,426
Two bloody daiquiris
please, on the rocks.

255
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,696
He means Bloody Marys.

256
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,531
She knows what I mean.

257
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,900
I want some cigarettes.

258
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,569
I'll send youu the cigarette girl.

259
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,904
I want some cigarettes, now!

260
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,440
<i>♪ Falling in love again</i>

261
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,909

Harry Flowers.

265
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,914
If old Elliot
found out about this...

266
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,954
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

267
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,556
Listen, sweetheart,

268
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,925
there's an old friend in
the joint who's not a friend
if you know what I mean.

269
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,426
He thinks
he knows me,
but if he does

270
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,494
I'm in trouble.
So it's better

271
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,930
if I'm not who he thinks I am.

272
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,531
Get it?

273
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,568
Who are you?
Mack's the name.

274
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,169
There's a nice piece
of change in this for you

275
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,237
if you play your cards right.

276
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,505
I'm going to have to kiss ya.

277
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,474
Kiss me?
Just an expression.
Don't let it bother you.

278
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,047
Uh-oh.

279
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,285
The young lady
don't like being stared at.

280
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:58,522
Well, well, what a coincidence.

281
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,592
You're making
some mistake here, mister.

282
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,494
There's no mistaking this, Flowers.

283
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,097
WhWhat did you call me?
Oh, my, you're really
xxxxxx, aren't you?

284
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,934
What name did you call m me?
Harry, take your hands off me.

285
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,270
I won't breathe
a word of this, I swear.

286
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,605
I don't like that name.
Harry, please.

287
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,440
You're choking me.
Easy, Mack.

288
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,709
Mack? She called you Mack.

289
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,344
Yeah, she does
my introductions, get it?

290
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,185
You're not Harry Flowers?

291
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,222
I told you I don't
like that name.
Okay, okay, excuse me.

292
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,458
You actually know him?
I know him.

293
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,193
Don't say nothing.

294
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,428
It's none of his business
that we live together.

295
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,301
Live together. I'm sorry,
but what a resemblance.

296
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,904
You look exactly
like a person I know.
The double of him.

297
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,272
Beat it.

298
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:51,208
Before I make you the double
of somebody you don'n't know.

299
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,577
Okay, I'm going. Forgive me.

300
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:01,118
You come here often?
Every night.

301
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,476
<i>Hello. Who is it?
What time is it?</i>

302
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,981
<i>Who's calling so late?
Come on, you coward, who's there?</i>

303
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:39,056
My God!

304
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,558
225 marks.

305
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,045
What have you done?

306
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:41,051
You talk a lot.
Not usually.

307
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,256
The maid comes on Tuesdays.

308
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,458
Swell place you got here.

309
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,360
It serves its purpose.

310
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:51,728
Yeah, I bet it does.

311
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,964
You talk a lot.

312
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,737
How much I owe you?

313
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:03,740
500 marks.
Forget it.

314
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,475
100 marks.

315
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,148
Hey, where you going?

316
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,884
To finish my drink at Danny's.

317
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,520
You only paid for the walk.

318
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,755
Well, that's all we've done so far.

319
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,563
I thought perhaps
you didn't like me.

320
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,098
Well, what made you think that?

321
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:36,606
Walking is n not what
I'm usually paid for.

322
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:52,789
I got an unusual request.

323
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,659
Unusual requests are extra.

324
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:59,196
If they leave marks, forget it.

325
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:05,936
I wantnt you to

326
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,839
teach me.
Teach you?

327
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,107
Teach you what?

328
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,812
I want to know what you know.

329
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:19,316
What I know can't be taught.

330
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,889
All right. Shall we
begin at the beginning?

331
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,661
Well, I've been
married almost a year.

332
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,801
Then we'll begin
just after the beginning.

333
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,775
Okay.

334
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,717
Hey, don't you

335
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,652
want to neck a little first?

336
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,655
- Necking is extra.
- I don't care.

337
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,158
There.

338
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,839
You forgot to sign your copy
for the rental agreement.
Forgive me..

339
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:19,876
Are you certain you
won't need any assistance?

340
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:22,379
You collect the autographs.
I'll do the drivin'.

341
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,947
Yes, sir.

342
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,863
The watercress was lousy.

343
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,966
The bread was lousy.
The tea was...

344
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,334
I think we're being followed.

345
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,170
Yeah? Where?
Behind.

346
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,673
My cousin has a red car.

347
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,174
The nerve.

348
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,211
He thinks he can
have three at once.

349
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,746
It's Harry Flowers.

350
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:59,916
It can't be.
Why, it does
look like Harry.

351
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:04,988
Harry? Harry?
Yoo-hoo, Harry?

352
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,423
Where is Harry?

353
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,630
The man following us
in that car looked
just like Harry.

354
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,865
Hey, that's silly.

355
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,434
Why would Harry
follow his own wife?

356
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,390
The door is open.

357
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,501
I think we have
a good lesson today.

358
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,837
Who was that?
Who was that man?

359
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:32,108
That was my brother.

360
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,078
No, that don't look
like your brother.

361
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,980
It must have been my cousin.

362
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,903
One moment, please.

363
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,387
You're early today.
I was on my lunch break.

364
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:57,127
Hey, don't you notice
the big bunch of flowers?

365
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:58,928
I see them, yes.

366
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,433
Well, what should I do?
Swallow 'em? Some
reception I got here today.

367
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,138
Let's be clear with each other.

368
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,774
I've got my price and that's all.

369
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,342
No questions asked.

370
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:13,643
But with men,

371
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,612
they first come
with flowers,
then chocolates.

372
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:18,581
And next they're asking
how does a nice girl like you

373
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,016
come to be in a place like this.

374
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,252
Hey, now, did I ask you that?

375
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,521
Well, I was never
a nice girl. Do you see?

376
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,290
Never?

377
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,592
Not ever.
So you might
as well swallow them.

378
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:35,698
Well, these aren't
for no girl.
These are for my teacher.

379
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,972
Flowers for the teacher.

380
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,142
I haven't got a vase.

381
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,953
They're beautiful. Thank you.

382
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,691
That was a nice present
for the teacher, you know.

383
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,137
Smart boy.

384
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:52,075
Smart boy.

385
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,447
One moment, please.

386
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,532
Hey, what do you know, baby?

387
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,238
Is it very cold?

388
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,041
I made tea.
Or whiskey if you want.

389
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,310
Oh, thanks,
but I ain't got
the time today..

390
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,481
Then we'll do it next time.

391
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,822
Mack?

392
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,861
Mack?

393
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,603
God, Mack.

394
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:36,406
Don't leave me now.
Not after that.

395
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,021
You and me are friends, right?

396
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:54,257
You love me, right?

397
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,725
Got it? Good.

398
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,827
What is it, darling?

399
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,229
What did he say to you?

400
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,940
Sarah?

401
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,612
Sarah?
Harry, is that you?

402
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:19,749
Yeah, it's me.
Why didn't you answer?

403
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,250
I'm busy..

404
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:11,768
Music...

405
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:14,737
This is how you say
hello to your husband?

406
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,305
I'm in the middle
ofof a death scene.

407
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:20,176
No kiss, no hug, no nothing?

408
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,915
Put the music back on.

409
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,856
Put it back.

410
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,526
You giving me ultimatums?

411
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,395
Daddy bought me that.

412
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,031
Daddy's going to be
very upset with yoyou.

413
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,500
XXXX on him.

414
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:51,007
I am going to tell him
what you said.

415
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,175
Where's my dinner?

416
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,343
How can you think of food?

417
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,479
My stereo's brokenen.

418
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,486
A man works all day.

419
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:04,854
He comes home.
He's hungry.

420
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,323
I am so angry.

421
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,827
See?
What is this?

422
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:16,699
This is my fairy dress.

423
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,402
Oh, yeah?

424
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:29,478
I wanted a fairy
for a wife, I would
have gone to fairyland.

425
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,854
Daddy!

426
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:41,257
You mamake another wish
like that, you get a kick
in the ass, little fairy.

427
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,959
Harry!

428
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,661
Now, get me something to eat.

429
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,063
No!

430
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,869
No! Let me go!

431
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:54,437
Let me go!

432
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,939
No! No!

433
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:58,975
No!!
Where the hell is it?

434
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,811
Where is what?
The kitchen.

435
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:04,313
Don't you know?
I forget. Come here.

436
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:06,916
I won't tell you.

437
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:10,119
Oh, yeah?

438
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,592
No, let me go!

439
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,694
Let me go!

440
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:25,134
Now cook me some food.

441
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:37,673
What the hell is this crap?

442
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:43,379
It's bean sprouts
with sesame seeds
and iced herbal tea.

443
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,449
You trying to starve me to death?

444
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,484
I'm not supposed to cook.

445
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,853
Who says?
Everybody.

446
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,826
Do you know what I like to eat?

447
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,495
Who cares?

448
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,632
My eyes are all runny.

449
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,209
That does it. Oh!

450
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:15,911
Daddy will be so furious with you.

451
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:40,302
"The owl and the pussycat
went to sea

452
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:43,739
"in a beautiful pea green boat.

453
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:47,576
"They took some honey
and plenty of money,

454
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:50,279
"wrapped up in a five pound note.

455
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:53,182
"The owl looked
up to the stars above

456
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,519
"and he sang to a small guitar...

457
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,921
"Oh, pussy, dear pussy.

458
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,890
"Oh, pussy, my love.

459
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:04,326
"What a beautiful pussy you are.

460
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:05,928
"You are."

461
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,068
Why aren't you
wearing your pajamas?

462
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:21,644
No, you don't.
It's not Friday.

463
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,712
What's this Friday bullxxxx?

464
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,594
What the hell kind
of hour is this to wake up?

465
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:22,731
Hey!

466
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,368
Hey, wake up!

467
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,243
Do you want me to pour
a bucket of water on you?

468
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,148
That's better.

469
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,585
Just because Harry's acting strange

470
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,987
doesn't mean we need
have a sour breakfasast.

471
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:48,123
If he'd expected me to cook,
I'd have called Cook.

472
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,159
BuBut how can I cook without Cook?

473
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,878
Pour you some
tea with honey?
I don't drink tea.

474
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:15,217
I'll make you some coffee.
No, I'll have a whiskey.

475
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,023
When did you start that?

476
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,928
I enjoy it.

477
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:31,634
Well, at least you're
not a secret drinker.

478
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:35,371
You're awful sweet
for a woman who went
to sleep on the floor.

479
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,875
Every day is new.
Isn't that right, Jebs?

480
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,244
What the hell's this
cat doing on the t table?

481
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,180
I always have breakfast with Jebs.

482
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:47,416
We have chchats.
You have chats?

483
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,620
She's upset just now.

484
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:53,589
You sit and chat with the cat?

485
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:59,995
Let's not talk to him
when he's like this.

486
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:01,697
Look, see how prpretty you looked?

487
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,402
The creamer!

488
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:10,372
The sugar bowl!

489
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:12,775
I'm nonot having breakfast
with a pussy cat.

490
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,744
Now you've done it.

491
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:21,550
You are really going
to get...
Really going to get it.

492
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:29,658
Hello, I'd like
to speak to my father.

493
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,295
Oh, the number.

494
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,734
Was the number in the mirror?

495
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,914
YoYou're being very nasty.

496
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,921
Why are you limping?
You never limped before.

497
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:01,056
You begin to see!

498
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:03,759
You make me late for ballet!

499
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:05,961
I'm late for class.

500
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:11,734
This is very bad luck for you.

501
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,169
I'm changing my luck.

502
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,908
You're mad about last night.

503
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:23,545
Why should I be mad?
It wasn't Friday.

504
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:28,650
Oh, listen, it doesn't
just have to be only Friday.

505
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:31,153
We can play love
on other days,
too, if you want.

506
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,554
Play love?

507
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,657
Yes, play love, you know.

508
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:40,662
No, you just want
to have it your own way.

509
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:43,699
Well, you won't get it!

510
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:03,619
Sarah, no...

511
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:06,355
It was just glass, Sarah.

512
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:12,461
It didn't have a mind
like you or heart like you.

513
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,097
You've been living
like a precious goldfish.

514
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:24,006
I'm crying and I can't even see it.

515
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,518
Where are you taking me?

516
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:39,254
It's Friday.

517
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,570
You're not Harry.

518
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,572
I knew he didn't limp.

519
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,982
You're somebody different.

520
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:13,222
Boy, are you ever going to get it?

521
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,181
Don't bust your knuckles.
I'm coming.

522
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:51,693
Who are you?

523
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:55,097
Your beloved husband.

524
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,500
You're a criminal, aren't you?

525
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,170
You ask too many
questions, sweetheart.

526
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,672
I won't tell.

527
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,443
I gotta go.

528
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:10,612
No, please stay.

529
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,884
You say one word
about this, and you'll
never see your husband alive.

530
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,221
Just stay for breakfast.

531
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:22,157
Daddy won't mind.

532
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,492
We'll say I'm sick.

533
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:28,096
Remember...

534
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:30,465
You keep your mouth shut
until you hear from me

535
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:31,633
or it's curtains for Harry.

536
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,135
I don't want to hear about it.

537
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:37,573
Don't go. We'll have tea.

538
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:52,020
You're late, Harry.

539
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,655
Yeah, I've been
getting it on with Sarah.

540
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:00,362
Got any sports pages
in there? Let me see.

541
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,571
What are you reading here.
The <i>Financial Times.</i> Oh, xxxx.

542
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,175
Get a newspaper, will ya?

543
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,120
Ah, here he is.

544
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,923
Our new Assistant VP.

545
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,394
Come in and say a word
to us, Mr. Flowers.

546
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,429
Hello, men.

547
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,133
It's nice to be here.

548
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:42,471
I'd like to make
reference to
my father-in-law,

549
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,573
Mr. Elliot,

550
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,110
who built this company
practically from scratch

551
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,545
with only my wife's
five million dollar
inheritance

552
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:52,648
from her deceased
mother to start with,

553
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:55,817
which we're all very proud of.

554
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,123
Now, we at Amsucco Corporation

555
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,059
have hit just about
every major group
in Europe and abroad

556
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:07,195
with cheap credit
they pay though
the nose for.

557
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:10,999
Now we got the poor,
the middle-class,
and the affluent.

558
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:14,503
But we're ignoring completely

559
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:17,172
one of the fastest
growing markets in
the world there is.

560
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,409
What market is that?

561
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,513
It's little kids.

562
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,016
Credit cards for little kids.

563
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:33,855
Hey, come on. I got
other ideas, if you
don't like that one.

564
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:37,693
No, we've heard
enough. Thank you.

565
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:40,529
Oh, yeah, all right.

566
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,532
Thank you.

567
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,471
It's very odd.

568
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,308
Harry never acted like that before.

569
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,380
Good morning,
Mr. Flowers.

570
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:03,518
Nice pair of legs you got.

571
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,390
Excuse me.

572
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:10,892
I said you got nice legs.

573
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:16,565
How about some eye opener?

574
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:18,500
No, thank you, sir.

575
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:21,169
Good girl.

576
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,706
Thank you, sir.

577
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:33,882
Herman rescinded those orders
you gave, Mr. Flowers.

578
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:38,086
He what?
He rescinded those
orders you gave.

579
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,392
You mean he didn't do
what I told him to do?

580
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,094
That's right.

581
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:50,599
Well, what did I tell him to do?

582
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:53,034
Refer the
Garret case back
to the Embassy.

583
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,336
Oh, yeah.

584
01:03:03,714 --> 01:03:05,547
Where's he hang out usually?

585
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:07,616
Herman's in partition number 37.

586
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,268
Where's Herman?

587
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,737
He's indisposed.

588
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:31,540
In the crapper, huh?

589
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,822
I want you to un-rescind
the orders, Herman.

590
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,757
What orders?

591
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,992
You know which orders.
Un-rescind 'em.

592
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:01,503
Oh, there you
are. Your wife's
waiting inside.

593
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,006
What's she doing here?

594
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,176
She is with her father.

595
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:10,579
Oh, you're using a cane.

596
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,583
What's it to ya?

597
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:16,685
Uh, I...
I only noticed.

598
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:19,020
Yeah, well...

599
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,167
He won't even take me to lunch.

600
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,237
Other wives' husbands
take them to lunch.

601
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:36,805
That's my wife you're
nuzzling there.

602
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:41,076
Look here, Flowers.
He's my daddy.

603
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,011
I ain't interested in the
psychology of it,

604
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,914
but I want to know
why you're not home
where you belong.

605
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:48,516
I won't have you
address her this
way in my presence.

606
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,921
Isn't he wonderful?
We'll all have lunch.

607
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:54,956
May I take your order, Miss Elliot?

608
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:57,392
Oh, pardon,
Mrs. Flowers.

609
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,828
Hey, you!

610
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:03,498
Yeah, you.

611
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:10,805
You try to pass this off as
Pouilly-Fuisse '64, huh?

612
01:05:10,841 --> 01:05:12,140
I beg your pardon, sir.

613
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:15,243
Think where you are, Harry.

614
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:18,513
This is a white Bordeaux '72.

615
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:21,216
It's not a good one, either.

616
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,986
It's a phony label.
I've seen this
work before.

617
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:30,992
You call this a
high-class joint, eh?

618
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:35,730
It's impossible.

619
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:41,136
Oh, yeah? You get me
a double martini on the
rocks with a twist

620
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,171
and mail that bottle
back to Bordeaux

621
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:45,040
unless you want the cops.

622
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,942
Oh, please, no.
Not the police.

623
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:48,743
We'll bring you
another bottle
at once.

624
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,080
You'd better be right, Harry.

625
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,882
I'll have a martini also.

626
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,051
No, you won't.
Make that two martinis.

627
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,256
May I take the rest of your order?

628
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:06,695
I think we'll have the steamed
vegetables all way around.

629
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,464
Steak, rare and bloody.
Me, too.

630
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,800
Lots of
ketchup on the side.
Me, too.

631
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:18,740
I'll have the steamed
vegetables with soy
sauce and a mineral water.

632
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:29,884
I wasn't looking.

633
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:45,233
Where you going?

634
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,639
You fool everybody else.

635
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,575
I'm the only one who
knows you're not Harry.

636
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,644
You've come to
steal Daddy's money,
haven't you?

637
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,546
I'd get back to lunch
if I were you.

638
01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:01,282
Take me with you.
What about your husband?

639
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:03,852
Oh, I'm finished with him.

640
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:07,122
You are?
You're much more
handsome and exciting.

641
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:11,026
I am?
Oh, yes.

642
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:16,297
Forget it.

643
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,704
I packed everything, see?

644
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:26,708
We can go to Switzerland
and ski while
they're looking for us.

645
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,012
I'll be unhappy if you go.

646
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:37,552
I am furious with you.

647
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:39,754
Sarah,

648
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,790
in the middle of the
street, my God!

649
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:10,245
Excuse me.

650
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,080
Rick Duprez, Detective Agency?

651
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,048
Huh.

652
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,418
I got a job for you.

653
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:51,419
I want you to call my
father-in-law,
Chairman Elliot, at once.

654
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:54,622
Tell him I'm going to
remove one pair of alligator
shoes from the vault.

655
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,293
You are familiar with these shoes.

656
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:00,795
I most c certainly am.
Excellent. Excellent.

657
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,031
The Chairman
waits for your call.
Talk to him personally.

658
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:07,969
Insist on it.

659
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,451
This is Hammel Slouchmeister.

660
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:30,291
Hammel Slouchmeister.

661
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:53,214
I insisted on speaking
to you personally.

662
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:57,719
Yes. Your son-in-law... Yes.

663
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:01,923
He wished me to
inform you personally

664
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:06,127
that he's removing
a pair of alligator
shoes from the vault.

665
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:08,263
That's correct, sir,
alligator shoes.

666
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:11,566
Oh, I have seen them myself.

667
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,268
They have white tops.

668
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,436
Yes. Yes.

669
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,573
Sir?

670
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:22,610
I've been with the company
eight years, sir.

671
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,814
Too long?

672
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,950
Oh, you think so, sir.

673
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:31,819
I'm sorry you say that, sir.

674
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:36,624
Yes, I'll give my
resignation to you
personally, sir.

675
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:32,280
Have you heard about Flowers?

676
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:34,682
Everybody says he's
gogone completely whacko.
Shh.

677
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:38,186
He attacked me in the men's room.

678
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:41,622
My God!

679
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:44,759
Not that way.

680
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:46,694
Oh.

681
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,330
He just walked by.

682
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,666
He came out of the
vault with a suitcase.

683
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,369
Where do you think he was going?

684
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,873
He came out of the vault...
He had a suitcase.

685
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:20,762
You speak English?

686
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:23,197
Yeah...
It's okay, we'll
split the fare.

687
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,767
Hey, the cab is taken.

688
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:28,403
Come on. You can't
sit two seats at
once, can you?

689
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:30,338
Drive it, will ya?

690
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,975
Fellow Americans.

691
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,011
Buddies, do you get it?

692
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,046
Pretty dense, this guy.

693
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,482
Listen, I got such a hangover.

694
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:44,419
I'm just going to
close my eyes for
a minute. OkOkay?

695
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:04,005
Next time it's
going to be my
treat, allll righ?

696
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:55,283
That's not the same guy.

697
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,818
You're telling me

698
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:33,154
two men occupied this room

699
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:34,488
but wore the sameme clothes.

700
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:37,925
Mind if I look around?

701
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,023
Not two men, lady.

702
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:13,928
One man with larceny in his heart..

703
01:17:23,006 --> 01:17:27,441
Am I to understand the
entire headquarters staff
of Amsucco Corporation

704
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:29,610
stood by while a man

705
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,946
walked out of this vault
with a plaid suitcase

706
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,581
containing five million dollars?

707
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,220
I want the guard fired.

708
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:41,288
He's already fired, sir.

709
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,558
Well, then fire that man.

710
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:46,994
You are fired.
Karl!

711
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:49,964
She's fired, too.

712
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,514
When you pay for Duprez,

713
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:09,316
you get Duprez.

714
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,366
Hello, hello, is that
someone there?

715
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,536
When you pay for Duprez,

716
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,539
you get Duprez.

717
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,312
You look like some mess, buddy.

718
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:39,814
I've been kidnapped.

719
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:41,716
Do you know your
wife's looking for you?

720
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:43,551
Oh, poor Sarah.

721
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,356
She must be so
worried and concerned.

722
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,226
Stand back.

723
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:56,664
Harry?

724
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,467
Where the hell hahave you been?

725
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,635
I was handcuffed in the sewer.

726
01:19:01,671 --> 01:19:03,471
Can't you smell it?

727
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:06,340
Can you descriribe
the man who
kidnapped you?

728
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:08,042
I don't
know. I'll try.

729
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:12,012
It seems this man
fits the description
perfectly.

730
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,881
This man, you mean.

731
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,184
The imposter was bold, reckless,

732
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,354
cunning, stylish and
clever, Inspector.

733
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:25,025
Harry here's quite
the opposite. No
doubt about that.

734
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:26,060
Where is he?

735
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:35,836
Oh, thank God. Thank
God they found you.

736
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:39,140
I thought I'd never see you.

737
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:42,476
That's enough.

738
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:49,150
It's not him.
What?

739
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:51,585
It's my husband.
This is my husband.
Of course.

740
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:54,822
The other man had a tattoo

741
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:58,425
of a big thick, black
snake curled tight
around this anchor.

742
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,561
He had a limp, too,
which he got in the war.

743
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,497
He was a captain in
the Algerian War

744
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:06,267
and he was shot and became a cynic.

745
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,173
But you're Harry.

746
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:15,209
Sweet, kind, punctual.

747
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,880
Oh, damn, you brought
back the wrong man.

748
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,882
Give me a break, will ya?

749
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,585
I want you to find my other Harry.

750
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:25,786
Think what you're saying, Sarah.

751
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:33,027
Sarah!

752
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,632
She had a shock.
She'll be all right.

753
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:41,602
Gentlemen, the
guy you're looking for

754
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:44,805
occupied a room
at 12<i> Pelicanstrass.</i>

755
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,474
Medium build,

756
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,977
menacing nose, bushy sideburns.

757
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:53,214
And red hair.

758
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:02,323
We fouound this suitcae
floating in the river.

759
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,795
Nothing in it but
these alligator shoes.

760
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,904
Good morning,
Mr. Flowers.

761
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:20,074
Good morning, Greta.

762
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:23,444
How is Mrs. Flowers?

763
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,079
Oh, she's the same, I'm afraid.

764
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,815
Well,

765
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:31,318
she did have to spend
all those hours
with an imposter.

766
01:21:32,255 --> 01:21:33,954
And God knows what they did there.

767
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:36,423
Thanks, Greta.

768
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:38,692
She won't have to
go to the hospital,
will she?

769
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:41,262
Not if I can help it.

770
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,966
Oh, they started the
newspaper serial today.

771
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:48,602
The most imaginative
crime of the decade.

772
01:21:48,638 --> 01:21:50,070
Yes, now to work.

773
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:51,105
Certainly.

774
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:56,410
A large deposit t was
made yesterday by
Braniff Airways.

775
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:59,313
A hundred thousand
sent to their agent,

776
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,149
Anthony Carswell

777
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:04,051
of Clevelaland, Ohio, USA.

778
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:07,888
Also Exxon Corporation is sending

779
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:11,225
a ququarter of a millin
to their agent,
Winslow MacLeigh

780
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:13,294
of Hartford, Connectcticut.

781
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,630
Now, on to Athens.

782
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,332
No, to Paris.

783
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:20,734
Yes.

784
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:23,971
To Paris,

785
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:27,141
US Steel is sending 500,000.

786
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:33,147
Five hundred thousand to Paris.

787
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,132
How is she, Doctor?

788
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:55,002
If she continues to refuse food,
we'll have to hospitalize her.

789
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:57,171
You mean you're a failure.

790
01:22:58,374 --> 01:23:00,174
Whatever this man did to her...

791
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,977
What the hell do you
think he did to her?

792
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,578
If you wish,
I'll withdraw from the case.

793
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:06,447
Just send me the bill, Doctor.

794
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:13,053
Quack! Fraud!

795
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:19,126
What are we going to do
about my little girl?

796
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:23,130
If she'd only eat something.
Ah, it's not her stomach.

797
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:24,865
It's her head.

798
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,769
She used to pull this when
she was a little girl.

799
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,539
Refuse to eat until
she got what she wanted.

800
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,146
Well, she's not going
to get it this time.

801
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,950
If they ever catch
up with this guy,

802
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:46,120
I want him myself.

803
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:37,805
She loves the other.

804
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:39,540
How perverse.

805
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,509
How very perverse.

806
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:44,945
What am I supposed to do,
play Mack for the rest of my life?

807
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:49,349
More sexy and exciting, huh?

808
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:05,399
What the hell.

809
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:35,596
Oh, it's you.

810
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:36,763
Yeah.

811
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:40,234
I love you, baby. I've
come back to you.

812
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:45,038
You're bleeding. Yeah.
Do you mind if I lean on you?

813
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:52,913
Are you taking me away?
It's dangerous for me here.

814
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:55,682
I'm not scared.

815
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:57,851
First to Switzerland,

816
01:25:59,221 --> 01:26:00,687
then to America.

817
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:03,690
Then, who knows.

818
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,627
America, how exciting.

819
01:26:08,364 --> 01:26:10,063
But I don't even know your name.

820
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:15,602
Well, I got different names.

821
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:19,239
You see, in Cleveland I'm known
as Anthony Carswell.

822
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:21,842
In Hartford, they call
me Winslow MacLeigh.

823
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,610
In Paris...
But what shall I call you?

824
01:26:25,915 --> 01:26:27,247
You can call me Mack.

825
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:29,650
Mack.

826
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:32,986
Oh, I like that.

827
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,327
Will you take me to a place
where I can dance?

828
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:46,967
Oh, like you've never danced before.
You're Mack's girl, now, ain't ya?

829
01:26:47,002 --> 01:26:49,670
Yes. I am
Mack's girl now.

830
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:05,746
Sexy and exciting.
