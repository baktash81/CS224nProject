1
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,759
-German bandits at 2 o'clock!
- Increase throttle! Power dive!

2
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,036
Spell it right, Rafe.

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,399
"Rudder" is spelled with two D's.

4
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,471
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,877
Whoa, bandits!

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,434
- Crack shootin', Danny.
- Crack shootin', Rafe.

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,397
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,196
Great flyin', Dad!

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,195
Come on. I'm gonna
teach you how to fly.

10
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,831
- I get the front!
- No, you take the back.

11
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,990
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,196
I'm older and I'm teachin',
so no.

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,431
- Wow. It's like we're really flying.
- Yeah, I did it lots of times.

14
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,273
Come on. You man the guns.
I'll give her some throttle.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,237
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,951
Oh, gosh!

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,148
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,311
I've seen my dad do this
lots of times. Don't worry!

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,111
Rafe!

20
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,715
- Oh, my gosh! We're flying!
- We're flying!

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,993
My dad's gonna kill me.
Come on.

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,080
Yes! Woo-hoo!

23
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,038
- We flew!
- We flew! Yes! I'm a pilot!

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,758
- I know!
- Yeah!

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,919
We flew.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,672
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy!

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,514
I done told you, you spend time playing
with this stupid boy, can't read...

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,158
you ain't never gonna
amount to nothin'!

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,437
He ain't stupid, Daddy!
Daddy!

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,154
Come on!

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,758
Get on back home. Now!

32
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,198
Get on up.
You got work to do.

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,635
Come on!
Come on. Get on home!

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,957
You let him alone!

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,998
Daddy, no!

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,629
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!

37
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,439
What'd you call me?

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,069
I fought the Germans
in France.

39
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,311
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,676
And I pray to God no one ever
has to see the things that I saw.

41
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,916
You're my best friend.

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,039
Daddy, wait!

43
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,232
Daddy, wait.

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,838
Adolf Hitler builds
the German military machine...

45
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,911
and drags
all of Europe into war.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,911
But even while France falls to Hitler...

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,912
America still refuses
to join the fighting.

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,400
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,911
All right, Danny.
Now, let's show 'em how to fly.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,433
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?

51
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,511
This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no crop dusters.

52
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,830
- I'm not playing chicken with ya.
- Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,434
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,317
You can turn or you can hit me.
It's up to you.

55
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,356
- What the--
- Oh, boy.

56
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,154
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,593
Which way you goin'?

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,554
I guess I'll go right.
No, left. I'll go left.

59
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,195
- Okay, we're goin' left, right?
- Uh, right. Right?

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,430
"Right" like we're going right
or "right" like we're going left?

61
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,956
Now you got me all mixed up!
I don't know. Make up your mind.

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,958
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,311
Those are some smooth aces.

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,311
Did you say something?

65
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,550
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

66
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,395
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,233
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,198
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

69
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,475
After two years of training...

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,235
you believe that a $45,000 aeroplane
is there for your amusement?

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,709
No, sir. I was just trying
to keep my edge, Major.

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,314
And when you did the outside loop
last week, what did you think that was?

73
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,958
Honing your skills?

74
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,395
That's not training, McCawley.
That's a stunt.

75
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,952
And I personally consider it
to be reckless and irresponsible.

76
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,155
Major.

77
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,713
How could that be when you're famous
for being the first man in the world
ever to do it?

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,950
- Don't get cute with me, son.
- No, sir. I--

79
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,919
I don't mean to be disrespectful.
I just think that-- Well, I--

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,389
It is reckless and irresponsible if
you're just doing it to be a show-off.

81
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,950
But I was doing it
to try to inspire the men, sir...

82
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,359
in the way that
you've inspired me.

83
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,396
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,152
when the men get together
to honour their leaders.

85
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,559
They call it an homage, sir.

86
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,392
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

87
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,913
That's bullshit, McCawley!

88
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,198
But it's very, very good bullshit.

89
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,510
Thank you, sir.

90
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,470
McCawley, you remind me
of myself 15 years ago.

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,437
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,758
Have a seat, son.

93
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,433
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

94
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,117
You're on your way to England
tomorrow, if you still want to go.

95
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,394
Wow.

96
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,391
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

97
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,914
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,592
They're gonna need all the help
they can get.

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,033
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.

100
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,198
Just for the record, I'm supposed
to ask you to reconsider.

101
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,714
- Sir?
- Sooner or later...

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,598
we're gonna be in this war
whether we like it or not.

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,989
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

104
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,719
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,678
Major, what would you do?

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,711
If it was me...

107
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,678
I'd go.

108
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,996
God! Am I going bald
right back here?

109
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,149
Ooh!

110
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,516
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.

111
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,953
Don't you ever die.

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,558
Die. That's exactly the concept
you gotta work tonight.

113
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,837
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...

114
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,831
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,549
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

116
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,916
Iet her see your eyes glisten
and say...

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,037
"Baby, they're training me for war...

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,475
and I don't know
what'll happen...

119
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,471
but if I die tomorrow...

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,588
I want to know that we lived
all we could tonight."

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,511
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

122
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,239
Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

123
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,231
How could you do this?

124
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,988
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,311
He wanted me to get some real--
real combat training in.

126
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,515
Well, guess what?

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,795
It's not training over there.
It's war...

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,791
where the losers die
and there aren't any winners...

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,110
just guys who turn into
broken-down wrecks like my father.

130
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,634
Yeah, I understand that, Danny,
but I feel like I got a duty to go.

131
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,429
Don't preach to me about duty, damn it.
I wear the same uniform you do.

132
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,399
Now, if trouble wants me, I'm ready
for it, but why go looking for it?

133
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,632
God, Danny, come on. I'm gonna be 25.
I might as well be an old man.

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,995
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

135
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,991
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,594
- I wanna be a combat fighter.
- Hey, come on!

137
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,672
The nurses can't
d-d-dance by themselves.

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,318
Let's go.

139
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,908
If the call to duty means seeing
150 men in their underwear every day...

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,275
we are here to serve.

141
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,830
I can't believe it.
Saturday night in New York City.

142
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,878
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from? Nothing.

143
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,632
Cow tipping.

144
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,914
That's why
you joined the navy, hon.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,911
Get out of that dusty little town
and see the world.

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,673
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're navy nurses, not tourists.

147
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,911
I joined to do my patriotic duty
and to meet guys.

148
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,873
Me too.

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,598
Girls, we're gonna have so much fun
tonight in the city.

150
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,079
You gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

151
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,957
What?

152
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,155
Oh, come on. Tell us.

153
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,710
- Oh, it's such a long story.
- We got time.

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,994
I saw it happen.

155
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,308
Well, it was about four weeks ago.

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,631
What do you think
is b-better?

157
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,315
All in the one cheek
or spreading them out?

158
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,310
Okay.

159
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,516
Fusco, Anthony.

160
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,957
You all right, buddy?

161
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,190
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

162
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,072
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.

164
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
J-j-just gimme a minute.

165
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,871
Honey, the government says
stick 'em, we stick 'em.

166
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,319
Hey, Red, you all right?

167
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,511
Eye exam number four?

168
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,310
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

169
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,516
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

170
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,955
Sorry, son.

171
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,998
I'm gonna fail.
They're gonna take my wings away.

172
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,230
No, they won't. just relax.

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,719
Read the bottom line, please.

174
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,074
Just keep practisin'
the bottom line.

175
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,832
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

176
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,514
J-L-M-K-P-O--

177
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,431
Thankyou.

178
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,192
- Next.
- Ma'am.

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,432
J-L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

180
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,272
Slow down, flyboy.

181
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,874
And instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,316
"C." Sorry. "j."

183
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,316
"C," "W," uh, "Q", uh, "Q."

184
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,596
Read the bottom line again, please,
but read it right to left...

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,716
and every other letter.

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,389
E-X--

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,675
- X-E.
- X-E.

188
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,990
X-E, ma'am.

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,548
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

190
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,312
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I really am...

191
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,356
but army and navy
requires 20/20 vision.

192
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,910
Oh, I-- It's not a problem
with my eyes. I mean, I can see.

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,911
I mean, I can hit a running rabbit
with a $3.00 pistol.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,433
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

195
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,637
Well, maybe after some schooling,
you could come back
and take the test again.

196
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,110
No, I had schooling.
I mean, the teachers just
never knew what to make of it.

197
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,236
It's just letters.
I mix 'em up sometimes. That's all.

198
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,790
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,351
Look here. My math and spacial reasoning
and my verbal scores are all excellent.

200
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,271
But you barely passed
the written exam.

201
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,396
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So is it my turn now?

202
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,550
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,791
Ma'am, I'm never gonna be
an English teacher.

204
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,793
But I know why I'm here:
to be a pilot.

205
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,917
And you don't dogfight with manuals.
You don't fly with gauges.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,558
It is all about feeling and speed...

207
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,596
and lettin' that plane become
like a part of your body.

208
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,752
And that manual says that a guy who's
a slow reader can't be a good pilot.

209
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,276
That file says
I'm the best pilot in this room.

210
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,355
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,672
Well, I felt so bad.

212
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,433
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

213
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,714
I had no choice.

214
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,756
I passed him.

215
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,759
So then this cocky pilot
comes back.

216
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,070
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,071
"Yeah"?
Boy, you're talking to an officer.

218
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,071
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
- Give me that file.

219
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,798
- Yes, sir.
- Parade rest.

220
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,995
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,672
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

222
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,035
Drop your skiwies.

223
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,872
Oh. Okay.

224
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,670
Just like this?

225
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,829
That's fine.

226
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,990
He did have a very cute butt.

227
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,150
You know, I know you didn't have
to pass me, and you did.

228
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,913
And I just-- I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,390
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.

230
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,278
- Thankyou.
- You're welcome.

231
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,318
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

232
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,913
You're like my hero now.

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,831
Actually, my father was a pilot...

234
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,549
and I've seen firsthand what happens
when a pilot loses his wings.

235
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,871
You know what?
Your father's my hero then too.

236
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,475
In fact, as an officer,
I think it'd be my duty...

237
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,313
to take my new hero's daughter out
tonight just to--

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,959
- Gosh, did I poke too deep?
- I think you hit the bone there.

239
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,799
You are so mean.

240
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,676
What, so is-- so is there any chance
that you might kind of, sort of...

241
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,228
you know, like me, or--

242
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,231
How did you guess?

243
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,154
They never taught us how
to deal with this feeling.

244
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,271
What feeling?

245
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,317
Well, it's kind of like this.

246
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,794
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,830
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,911
Hold on a second.

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,878
Miss, I really, really lick you.

250
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,320
Ah! What did he mean?

251
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,118
Like you.

252
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,589
I didn't mean to say that.
And I just, um...

253
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,830
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

254
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,876
He started to act very strange.

255
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,791
Or, well, buy you dinner.

256
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,796
- This isn't your chart.
- Whoa!

257
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,554
No. That's the, uh, this fellow
over here's. I think he left.

258
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,198
Have you already
had this shot?

259
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,919
Yeah, well, once already.

260
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,674
Well, I wanted-- I mean, I just--
can I ask you out?

261
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,637
No.

262
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,756
And he just went wham!

263
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,839
Oh! What'd you do to him?

264
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,154
Poor guy.

265
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,309
Hey!

266
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,269
Hey!

267
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,715
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,394
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine. I feel great.

269
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,519
This is just standard,
precautionary thing.

270
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,912
But, look, I got some, uh, genuine
French champagne from France.

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,833
And I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

272
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,036
Celebrate what?

273
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,749
Oh, I don't know.
You being my hero, for one.

274
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,833
Okay. Why not?

275
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,831
So I wanted to thank you...

276
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,072
and I just wanted to put your mind
at ease about passing me...

277
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,674
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

278
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,389
I mean, I am a great flier.

279
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,952
And if you have a fault, which you
obviously don't, it's modesty.

280
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,635
No. If I have a fault,
it's candour.

281
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,996
You are just so--

282
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,951
Cork just got away from me.

283
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,120
God, it hurts!

284
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,555
It hurts something fierce.

285
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,915
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,230
- It's bleeding.
- God.

287
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,469
Oh.

288
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,870
- Lay still.
- I ruined everything. Oh, it hurts.

289
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,269
- It's cold!
- It'll stop the bleeding.

290
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,590
- I can't breathe.
- Lay still.

291
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,076
You are so beautiful,
it hurts.

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,150
It's your nose that hurts.

293
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,476
I think it's my heart.

294
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,476
And then I kissed him.

295
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,510
Evelyn, that's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

296
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,918
It's been the most romantic
four weeks and two days of my life.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,718
I'm so jealous.

298
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,794
Hello, Lieutenant.
It's good to see you.

299
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,031
- You, too, Lieutenant.
- Pick a hand.

300
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,508
It's beautiful.

301
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,316
What's in your other hand?

302
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,277
Mine.

303
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,438
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

304
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,591
I want you to meet
my friends.

305
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,752
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra.

306
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,070
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

307
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,789
Would you happen
to have any friends?

308
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,916
Take your pick.

309
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,479
Hi.

310
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,231
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

311
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,073
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

312
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,073
that someone as sweet as you will
be there to nurse me back to health.

313
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,435
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.

314
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,913
Okay. That was a bad line.

315
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,275
Hi.

316
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,749
I'm-- I'm Red.

317
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,834
Red S-S-Strange.

318
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,388
- Your last name's Strange?
- Yeah, she's all yours, soldier.

319
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,869
No. It's-- It's Winkle.

320
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,118
Red is such a ladies' man.

321
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,158
- Do you always stutter?
- No. Only when I'm--

322
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,194
She's totally buying it.

323
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,952
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

324
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,598
Why can't I get
something like that?

325
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,313
- Hello.
- Hi.

326
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,598
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

327
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,193
It's not that he's shy.

328
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,829
He's just a little unsure
of himself, you know.

329
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,751
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

330
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,435
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

331
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,080
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

332
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,958
You know, my right hand.

333
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,476
Which, at the moment,
is a long way south of my waist.

334
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,993
Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,719
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

336
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,677
Yeah, I guess you did.

337
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,159
Excuse me.

338
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,395
You and me,
we got to talk.

339
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,916
So the rumour is the navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

340
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,831
Well, won't be so bad.

341
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,037
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

342
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,917
You'll get a suntan.

343
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,798
So maybe the army
will post you guys there too.

344
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,714
You are
a super special woman.

345
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,199
And, and, well--

346
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,237
Well, they're training me
to be a big bad warrior...

347
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,676
and, well--

348
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,198
So I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow or--

349
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,271
or any day after that,
you know?

350
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,669
So...

351
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,038
God, we need to make tonight
super special.

352
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,031
Why are you crying?

353
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,351
I guess it's the thought that I might
not ever get to see you again.

354
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,273
Dry your eyes, toots.
Tonight you're mine.

355
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,430
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

356
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,830
I just want to be
alone with you.

357
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,515
Well, how does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

358
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,911
Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,513
Of course
I'm a bad influence.

360
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,397
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...

361
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,391
'cause we're officers
of the U.S. government.

362
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,311
Not for long, we won't be.

363
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,911
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

364
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,558
Would you like that?

365
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,679
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the Grand Salon.

366
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,912
No one's talking about war.
They're just dancing to Cole Porter.

367
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,070
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

368
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,117
- Come on. There you go. All aboard.
- You're out of your mind.

369
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,191
Yeah. Careful now.
Here, sit down.

370
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,349
Now, let's see here.

371
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,189
There we go.

372
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,078
See, this is as close
as I could get you to your ship.

373
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,390
So at least I tried, right?

374
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,479
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

375
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,993
Yeah, it is.

376
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,433
God, you're pretty.

377
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,351
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

378
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,798
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

379
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,394
No. I guess you're right.

380
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,356
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

381
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
- Yeah, are you?
- That was not part of the date.

382
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,838
- Watch your step.
- Oh, thank you.

383
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,390
- Evelyn!
- Guys, come up! Come on--

384
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,353
Come up!
We're in 321.

385
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,317
There's something
I got to tell you.

386
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,277
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

387
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,351
I've seen your medical chart.

388
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,317
This can't be good,
or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

389
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,313
Yeah. I got to go away.

390
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,630
We're all going away.

391
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,517
Yeah...

392
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,990
but I'm going to the war
tomorrow.

393
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,991
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

394
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,710
It's an outfit the British started
for American pilots.

395
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,236
I don't understand.

396
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,880
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?

397
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,316
They didn't order me.
I volunteered.

398
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,431
But I passed you.
I let you through.

399
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,637
And now you volunteer for the most
dangerous place you could go?

400
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,077
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

401
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,515
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

402
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,956
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

403
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,673
Meeting you.

404
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,518
I love you.

405
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,591
I love you so much.

406
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,991
Let's go inside.

407
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,437
All right. Wait a minute.
I just-- I can't do this.

408
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,229
This just-- It's not right.
I'm sorry. I just--

409
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,470
See, I can't do this.
I mean, I--

410
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,233
I mean, I can.
I-- I want to.

411
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,197
I'm not trying
to be noble, you know.

412
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,555
Or not saying
I know what would happen.

413
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,074
Or just--
I need to stop talking.

414
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,118
I just-- I just don't want it-- I just
don't want it to be like everybody else.

415
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,034
I don't want you to have anything
about tonight that you'll regret.

416
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,157
I mean, it's been
the most incredible night of my life...

417
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,356
and I don't want
to ruin that.

418
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,271
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

419
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,514
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

420
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,151
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

421
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,391
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

422
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,758
I want to know that the best part
of my life is still ahead of me.

423
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,353
Look.

424
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,874
Don't--

425
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,918
Could you
not come see me off?

426
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,390
Because saying goodbye to you
once is hard enough.

427
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,671
Here.

428
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,874
- Take this.
- You think it looks good on me?

429
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,476
I will come back.

430
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,392
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

431
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,278
- Yeah, I did.
- Why are you looking for her then?

432
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,999
It's my test.

433
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,036
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

434
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,838
then I--
I know she loves me.

435
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,514
All aboard!
Track 57!

436
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,828
If, uh, anything
happens to me...

437
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,118
I want you to be
the one to tell her, all right?

438
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,270
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

439
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,955
- See you when I get back.
- Yeah.

440
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,478
Good hunting, Rafe.

441
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,235
Evelyn! Evelyn!

442
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,229
Evelyn!

443
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,235
Evelyn! Evelyn! Hey!

444
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,030
She loves me.

445
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,196
The German Luftwaffe relentlessly
bombards downtown London...

446
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,511
while Churchill's Royal Air Force
is in a deadly struggle...

447
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,558
to maintain control
of the British skiies.

448
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,195
This is a real mess.

449
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,555
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

450
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,556
Good. We'll get you settled
into your quarters...

451
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,757
and then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

452
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,276
Yes, sir, well, if y'all are patching up
bullet holes right here on the runway...

453
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,749
maybe we ought to skip housekeeping
and get me right into an aeroplane.

454
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,832
Two didn't come back, sir.
We counted only eleven.

455
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,558
Are all Yanks as anxious as you
to get themselves killed, Pilot Officer?

456
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,359
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

457
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,673
This is yours.

458
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,833
Good chap.

459
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,878
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

460
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,112
Please be seated,
gentlemen.

461
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,475
I'm afraid
I'm in a bad mood.

462
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,677
Churchill and Stalin are asking me
what I'm asking you.

463
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,436
How long is America going
to pretend the world is not at war?

464
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,159
We've increased food and oil supply
shipments to them, Mr President...

465
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,389
and as far as I know--

466
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,429
What they really need are tanks, planes,
bullets, bombs and men to fight.

467
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,878
But our people think Hitler and
his Nazi thugs are Europe's problem.

468
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,433
We have to do more.

469
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,115
Send the Brits and Russians more of
our ships and anti-aircraft weapons.

470
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,997
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?

471
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,718
What choice do we have?

472
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,271
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

473
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,719
This is so exciting.

474
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,870
You know, there's about
a hundred ships on Pearl.

475
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,632
And how many sailors per ship?

476
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,631
It depends. There's more
on a battleship than a sub.

477
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,314
But say, on average, 2,000?

478
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,517
Yeah, but then there's the fliers,
the marines, the base personnel.

479
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,636
I'm still working on the sailors.

480
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,233
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favour.

481
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,038
Yeah, like 4,000 to 1.

482
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,519
It's paradise.

483
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,797
See you on the beach, boys!
We're in Hawaii!

484
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,958
Hey, you know, you're not
supposed to be paintin' titties
on the side of my aeroplanes.

485
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,759
And if you do,
don't make 'em lopsided.

486
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,274
- They were lopsided, Earl.
- Look, it says right here.

487
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,433
"Never ride waves amongst rocks
or submerged pilings."

488
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,919
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.

489
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,958
Well, how you gonna know they're
submerged if they're submerged?

490
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,508
Hey, Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?

491
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,511
He's trying to fix
this surfboard thing of his.

492
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,318
He keeps taking chunks off his nose
on the rocks.

493
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,914
I thought I'd come in on my day off,
work on my new invention--

494
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,639
the Gooz cruise fin.

495
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,994
I'm gonna be a rich fella.

496
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,196
Every surfboard in the nation's
gonna need one.

497
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,793
Yeah?
You're gonna need a broom.

498
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,269
Oh. Check out
these new recruits.

499
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,599
- Hi.
- Aloha.

500
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,910
Y'all pilots?

501
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,991
We're working on it.

502
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,911
There's a lot of switches
and stuff.

503
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,635
- Pride of the Pacific.
- Who are you?

504
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,718
Terrors of the Skies.

505
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,953
- Welcome, ladies.
- Hi.

506
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,554
I have to deal with
Coastie's sunburnt rump...

507
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,710
before I can show you around.

508
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,311
Dear Evelyn...

509
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,868
it's different than I thought
it would be here.

510
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,632
It's cold.

511
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,236
So cold it goes deep
into your bones.

512
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,312
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

513
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,470
That is to think of you.

514
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,949
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

515
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,395
It's not easy making friends.

516
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,836
Two days ago, I had a beer
with a couple of the RAF pilots.

517
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,831
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.

518
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,032
Dear Rafe...

519
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,759
I miss you so much.

520
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,435
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.

521
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,114
I'm right on his tail!

522
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,433
Got one!

523
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,795
Every night I look at the sunset...

524
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,839
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...

525
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,878
and send it
from my heart to yours.

526
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,230
Family?

527
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,197
Girl, sir.

528
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,510
The girl.

529
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,108
A lot of people frown on the Yanks
for not being in this war yet.

530
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,918
I'd just like to say...

531
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,798
if there are many more
back home like you...

532
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,952
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

533
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,277
Atten-hut!

534
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,351
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...

535
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,476
commander-in-chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

536
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,039
Sharp presentation, Captain.

537
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,712
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

538
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,268
For four months now,
Washington's been blowing pink smoke...

539
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,952
about the threat from japan.

540
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,191
Could make us lose our fighting edge.
I'm determined not to let that happen.

541
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,874
With your permission,
Captain.

542
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,793
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.

543
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,152
I'm supposed to keep this fleet
battle-ready to take on the japanese...

544
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,549
cover half the damn globe.

545
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,473
Now they want me to transfer
another 12 destroyers to the Atlantic.

546
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,039
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?

547
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,917
They feel Europe
is the greater danger, Admiral.

548
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,833
I'm assuming these risk assessments
include Hawaii.

549
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,912
Well, Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack...

550
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,433
and we're surrounded by sub nets.

551
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,397
All we have to worry about here
is sabotage...

552
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,677
so we bunched our planes together
to make them easier to protect.

553
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,796
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

554
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,714
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

555
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,679
The smart enemy hits you exactly
where you think you're safe.

556
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,756
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrical systems, sir...

557
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,671
but the oil hoses
still need attention.

558
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,115
- just crank it, Ian!
- God speed you, sir.

559
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,915
Red section, take the bombers.
Blue section, look out for fighters.

560
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,592
Bombers dead ahead.

561
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,750
Let's drop in on 'em
and give 'em a reception.

562
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,035
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.

563
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,429
- Go right at the lead bomber.
- Following you, Red One.

564
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,275
Good hit! Good hit!

565
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,031
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

566
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,068
I have the middle bomber.

567
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,875
Hammer down!

568
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,154
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.

569
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,592
I got two M.E.'s dead ahead.

570
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,512
I'm on him. I'm on his tail.
Hammer down.

571
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,037
I got one of them!

572
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,428
I got another one.

573
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,750
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail!

574
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,399
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!

575
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,358
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!

576
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,710
I got an oil leak!

577
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,312
Can't see a damn thing!

578
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,080
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!

579
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,593
I can't bail out!

580
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,433
He's on my tail, Red Two.

581
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,991
I'm hit! I'm hit!

582
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,591
Mayday! Mayday!

583
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,111
Oh, my God.

584
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,954
- I'm no good at church.
- What do you mean, sweetie?

585
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,271
Well, whenever I'm up there
getting my slate wiped clean...

586
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,113
I can't help but think of how
I'm gonna dirty it up again.

587
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,158
- This from a virgin.
- I've got to inventory supplies.

588
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,199
Oh! Kill me now.
Could you be any more boring?

589
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,111
Don't bother.
Sundays she writes Rafe.

590
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,555
Ten pages
instead of the usual five.

591
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,552
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

592
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,639
Hey, sweetheart.

593
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,069
She hates me.

594
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,875
- Good to see you, Red.
- Sure good to see you, too, Betty.

595
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,758
What are you doing?
You wanna come for a ride? Come on.

596
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,990
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

597
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,634
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

598
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,996
You hit pretty hard
for a cook.

599
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,190
All right, Walker, who you got?
Come on. Fight's almost over.

600
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,113
- I'll take the cook.
- Why? You don't like money?

601
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,558
Come on!
Get out there now!

602
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,235
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

603
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,320
Against the mechanic?
That guy craps rivets.

604
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,437
How's it feel up from that dark, oily
engine room? Sunlight botherin' you?

605
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,035
Ow.

606
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,037
Man, he's getting
all busted up in there!

607
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,233
Move! Move!

608
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,752
Come here. We gotta talk.
Get down here.

609
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,877
- He can't hurt us.
- He can hurt us.

610
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,918
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

611
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,309
That's a scratch.
You see this here?

612
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,756
This here's the hard-earned greenbacks
of every pot-scrubbin', dish-washin'
chop in this here fleet.

613
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,753
Now, if we don't win, the Teeny here
has to find himself another battleship.

614
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,717
'Cause there's no way I'm going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.

615
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,473
Don't worry about the money.

616
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,552
I'm gonna send that smug
engine-fixin' snipe...

617
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,631
back below decks
where he belong.

618
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,711
Come on, man! We the man!
You the man!

619
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,189
He slapped your mama, remember?
Be a son of a bitch!

620
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,068
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!

621
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,035
That's enough.
That's enough.

622
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,710
Oh! Where's my money?

623
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,028
Nah. Fight's rigged.

624
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,395
We're rich!

625
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,035
How'd you get this?

626
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,315
Boxing.

627
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,753
Did you win?

628
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,558
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,269
What do you get
for winning?

630
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,998
Respect.

631
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,672
So why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

632
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,038
I left my mama in Texas and
joined the navy to see the world...

633
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,111
become a man.

634
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,873
They made me a cook.

635
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,158
Not even that. I, uh,
clean up after other sailors eat.

636
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,357
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

637
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,991
Well, let's hope
you never have to.

638
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,355
Yes, ma'am.

639
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,192
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.

640
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,838
You, too, ma'am.

641
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,510
You know,
he taught me to fly.

642
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,068
I always knew that no matter
what kind of trouble I got into...

643
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,549
I'd never be in it alone.

644
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,200
He'd be there with me.

645
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,311
Up there, he was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

646
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,195
He told me you were
a great flier.

647
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,955
It was the same night he told me
he volunteered to go to England.

648
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,520
Volunteered?

649
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,670
He--

650
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,194
He told me
he'd been assigned.

651
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,958
He was always
trying to protect me.

652
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,590
But you know what? I look at myself
in the mirror in this uniform...

653
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,309
and I still don't know
who I am.

654
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,198
I look like a hero...

655
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,714
but I don't feel like it.

656
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,637
Rafe...

657
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,996
he always looked the part,
didn't he?

658
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,389
He couldn't wait to be one.

659
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,391
To Rafe McCawley.

660
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,720
The best pilot...

661
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,315
and the best friend
I ever knew...

662
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,913
or ever will know.

663
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,593
To Rafe.

664
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,795
Look at this. Look at this.

665
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,792
The japanese are flooding
the Pacific with radio traffic.

666
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,519
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to Southeast Asia.

667
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,113
There's no logical pattern
in it, Captain.

668
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,555
No, there's--
There's always logic.

669
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,278
They know we read their mail.

670
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,399
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

671
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,152
I'm not buying it.

672
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,198
Something, something--
Something's up.

673
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,795
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

674
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,911
Evelyn, um, I signed for
these letters for you today.

675
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,395
They're from England.

676
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,072
They're from Rafe.

677
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,037
I'm sorry, Ev.

678
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,714
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

679
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,114
- Hurry up!
- Show time, boys! Come on!

680
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,315
America still awaits Japan's response
to peace proposals.

681
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,868
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington...

682
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,748
in what could hopefully guarantee
continued peace in the Pacific.

683
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,990
On the British front,
Churchill declares...

684
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,038
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish the job. "

685
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,992
The RAF has fought bravely...

686
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,119
against Hitler's ambition
to rule the skiies over the Channel.

687
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,590
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.

688
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,632
- Evelyn!
- Danny.

689
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,188
- Hey.
- Some comedy, huh?

690
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,232
- Yeah.
- It's been awhile.

691
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,709
Yeah, I've been logging
a lot of flight hours.

692
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,519
I kinda been
avoiding you too.

693
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,238
Yeah.

694
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,436
- Look--
- Do you--

695
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,830
- Do you want to?
- Sure, yeah.

696
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,230
I remember this one time
when I was like seven years old.

697
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,470
I was always building
these gadgets and things.

698
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,471
He told me he wanted me
to build him some wings...

699
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,551
so that he could fly like
his daddy, dusting crops.

700
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,473
I told him you can't fly without
some kind of engine, right?

701
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,516
But he wouldn't listen.
You know, he told me...

702
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,636
"Danny, never mind all that.
Just build 'em anyway."

703
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,756
So I did.

704
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,355
And I'm up there, strapping
these big ol' wings on his back...

705
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,592
that we made from paper and glue
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.

706
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,274
He looked so stupid, you know?
And I told him...

707
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,715
"You can't jump off
the barn in these."

708
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,994
And bam!

709
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,469
He busted his leg
on the backhoe.

710
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,919
God, I miss him.

711
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,279
Yeah, but don't you think that Rafe
wasn't back up there the next day...

712
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,395
cast and everything...

713
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,029
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.

714
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,396
Wow. Check this out.
Crossroads to the Pacific.

715
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,996
Tahiti, 1,700 miles.
All right! Okay.

716
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,677
Say, Betty.

717
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,152
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?

718
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,276
- You've gotta stand up, please.
- What do you mean, get up?

719
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,794
Just stand up.
Stand up here.

720
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,199
Oh!

721
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,919
- Betty--
- Red, come on!

722
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,355
We got a dinner reservation.

723
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,673
Can I get a minute?

724
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,034
What's the matter,
you sick?

725
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,352
Can a guy propose?

726
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,831
Oh! Thankyou!

727
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,277
Am I talking too much?
Sometimes I do that. I'm sorry.

728
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,039
Hold up. Look at this.

729
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,599
Hello.

730
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,271
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay. Hey!

731
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,155
I guess I should go.

732
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,879
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again, all right?

733
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,599
- I had a good time.
- Yeah, me too.

734
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,356
- Do you want me to walk you home?
- No, I'll be fine.

735
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,237
No. Of course.

736
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,390
- Good night, Danny.
- Good night.

737
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,951
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

738
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,874
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie.

739
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,599
What am I doing?

740
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,874
Okay.

741
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,434
Oh! You were asleep.
I'm sorry.

742
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,158
Danny?

743
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,434
Is something wrong?

744
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,511
No! There's nothing wrong.
There's no problem. Hi.

745
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,955
It's just Danny.

746
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,999
I just-- You--
You forgot this.

747
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,918
Oh.

748
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,915
Thanks. It was good of you to take
the trouble to drop it over now.

749
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,560
I-- I thought you might need it,
you know...

750
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,074
uh, maybe tomorrow morning.

751
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,993
If, uh-- I mean, not that
you wear this to work, but--

752
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,911
No. It's a hanky.

753
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,997
Right, right. Yeah.

754
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,396
Listen, I was thinking
maybe, uh, I could come by
some time or give you call--

755
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,948
If I gave you a call,
could I come by some time?

756
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,678
Once, maybe,
if you're not busy?

757
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,954
Yeah, maybe.

758
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,395
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

759
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,595
Okay, all right.

760
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,911
- Thanks. Good night.
- Goodbye. Good night. Good night.

761
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,116
You are such an idiot.

762
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,069
- Did you have fun last night?
- It wasn't how it looked.

763
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,914
And if it was, it'd be all right.
It's been months. It's time to move on.

764
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,229
- I am moving on.
- Ev, don't lie.

765
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,709
All I know is I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

766
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,268
When my dad left, I was too much
for my mom to handle...

767
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,113
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

768
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,909
I thought my life was over, but you
don't know where it's all going to lead.

769
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,754
If I hadn't have run away and lied
about my age and enlisted in the navy...

770
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,152
I-- I wouldn't have met Red,
and-- now he's my fiance.

771
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,230
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.

772
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,356
- It's only been 12 hours.
- Oh, Betty.

773
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,351
Uh, Little Betty beat us all
to the post.

774
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,989
And this is ward three.
As you can see, no patients.

775
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,036
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on. I'll show you the bar.

776
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,111
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

777
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,112
- Come on. Excuse me, ladies.
- Hi!

778
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,156
We're gonna wait two years until
I'm 19 and Red can buy me a ring.

779
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,996
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you
so you would be okay...

780
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,072
so you can move on.

781
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,993
You gotta go on living, Ev.

782
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,838
Red!

783
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,751
Oh! Sorry.

784
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,749
Bye, Rafe.

785
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,956
The japanese fleet is missing.

786
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,395
They're operating
under radio silence.

787
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,229
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28.

788
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,669
Well, we're sending scout planes in
wider vectors all over the Pacific...

789
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,352
but they get nothing.

790
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,510
Now, they could be
anywhere in here.

791
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,515
I don't understand how two whole
carrier divisions can just disappear.

792
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,873
Clear!

793
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,399
Oh, we're all over the page.

794
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,198
We got one walleyed
and one pigeon-toed.

795
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,840
- Anthony, tap in number six.
- All right.

796
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,148
- Gooz?
- Yeah?

797
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,037
- Tap in number three.
- All right.

798
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,350
Hey, we got a visitor.

799
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,830
Oh, that ain't no
navy issue uniform, eh?

800
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,913
- Danny, it's Evelyn.
-jesus.

801
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,515
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

802
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,989
No.

803
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,593
I think I'm falling for her.

804
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,514
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.

805
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,717
I didn't want this to happen.
It just kind of did. Can't help it.

806
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,268
Well, Danny, she's got to be
with somebody. It might as well be you.

807
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,272
You're telling me
if you were dead, and you saw
your best buddy doing your girl...

808
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,430
you wouldn't come back and
beat the livin' crap out of him?

809
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,432
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

810
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,080
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

811
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,991
I got a girlfriend.

812
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,677
That's great.
Come on, fellas. Let's split.

813
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,877
Danny, whatever happens now is
just about you and her.

814
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,599
You got to try
and forget about Rafe.

815
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,999
Be careful, all right?

816
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,992
Ladies cloud the mind.

817
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,956
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

818
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,671
Hey, Danny.

819
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,316
Where's everybody going?

820
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,958
Just being discreet.

821
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,395
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

822
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,994
No, no.

823
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,752
Right.

824
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,035
Well, maybe--
maybe a little, yeah.

825
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,112
Well, people in this outfit have way
too much time on their hands.

826
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,428
Oh, yeah.

827
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,988
I just hope they don't think
there's been something going on
between us. That's all.

828
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,878
Oh, no, I mean, no. I mean,
that would be embarrassing, right?

829
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,279
I forgot my wrenches.

830
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,158
- It'd definitely be embarrassing.
- Yeah.

831
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,439
- Hi. Forgot my wrenches.
- Hey. He really doesn't have to leave.

832
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,919
No.

833
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,434
I, uh-- I'm just going out
with the girls, so--

834
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,833
- Guess I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

835
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,514
- All right.
- Yeah. All right. I'll see you around.

836
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,951
Shit.

837
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,996
Evelyn?

838
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,036
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

839
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,277
- Of course.
- Well, from the air?

840
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,509
You know, I could get kicked out
of the military for this.

841
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,160
- Really?
- Yes. Stay down.

842
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,114
The Hawaiians call
this harbour Wai Momi.

843
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,556
- It means "water of pearls."
- It's so beautiful.

844
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,234
My dad took me up
a couple of times.

845
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,198
Just don't do what he did.
What do you call it? When you flip over?

846
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,589
- A barrel roll?
- Yeah.

847
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,875
Oh.

848
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,911
Oh!

849
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,672
Oh, my God.

850
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,194
- What do you think?
- I like that.

851
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,071
- Hey, that plane was supposed...
- Duck.

852
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,673
to be back here an hour ago.

853
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,320
Quick. Hide in
the parachute hangar.

854
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,310
My heart is pounding.

855
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,189
Danny, last night--

856
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,316
No, that's terrible.

857
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,275
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

858
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,798
- Sir. Evelyn!
- Danny!

859
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,030
Hey. Hi.

860
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,396
Hi.

861
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,154
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

862
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,673
I had to see ya.

863
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,116
Last night was crazy, I know,
but I'm not sorry.

864
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,351
Are you?

865
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,557
I don't know.

866
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,235
Danny, I had a wonderful time
last night. I--

867
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,788
- It's just all too fast.
- Listen, Evelyn.

868
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,758
I was just down at the beach this
morning, and I watched the sun rise...

869
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,308
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different...

870
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,870
that this was the start
of something new...

871
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,758
in this place,
in this moment...

872
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,957
and I don't care
what anybody else says, you know?

873
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,508
How can I not feel this way?

874
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,353
I kind of like ya.

875
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,520
Oh, you do?

876
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,112
You have your tie on crooked.

877
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,879
Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

878
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,795
Everything's gonna be all right.

879
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,158
Do you have any air tours
going through the valley of Oahu?

880
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,834
You do?

881
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,432
Aloha. This is KGMB
in Honolulu...

882
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,478
on another beautiful fall day
here in paradise.

883
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,553
We have enough information.

884
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,511
We are returning home.

885
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,993
Do you ever wonder if
this war's gonna catch up with us?

886
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,317
Not a whole lot.

887
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,351
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.

888
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,317
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these.

889
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,597
'Cause I have no idea how I'm gonna
get this car out of the sand.

890
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,591
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?

891
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,114
You've been there for an hour.
Evelyn!

892
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,589
What are you trying to do?
Look like me?

893
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,674
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

894
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,514
What's the matter? No, you--

895
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,397
They call it the Vacant Sea.

896
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,391
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...

897
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,439
and you could bury the entire land mass
of Asia there, and nobody would know.

898
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,115
From there,
they could attack anywhere.

899
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,237
Our last signals intercept indicate
that the japanese task force...

900
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,073
is heading south, toward
the Philippines or Southeast Asia.

901
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,355
But Captain Thurman
of Naval Intelligence here...

902
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,908
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

903
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,197
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us
where it'll hurt us the most--

904
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,599
Pearl Harbor.

905
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,955
That's over 4,000 nautical miles
from japan.

906
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,430
To Pearl, that's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

907
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,556
Your theory--
It's based on what?

908
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,551
Well, it's what I would do.

909
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,712
It's not exactly hard evidence,
Captain Thurman.

910
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,234
Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence,
we'd already be at war.

911
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,232
Sir, we can read their diplomatic
codes faster than they can type them.

912
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,596
But Captain Thurman's cryptology team is
still trying to crack the naval codes.

913
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,433
The intercepts have missing words
and garbled lines.

914
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,431
So to explain the decrypts...

915
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,193
we have to try to interpret
what we think they're trying to do.

916
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,238
Interpret? You mean, guess.

917
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,630
They use their
informed intuition, sir.

918
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,473
We guess. It's like
playing chess in the dark.

919
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,235
Any rumour, troop movement, ship
movement, spine tingle, goosebump...

920
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,311
we pay attention to it.

921
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,470
When I was in the Asiatic fleet,
the locals used to try to...

922
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,790
get outside of a problem
to try to see the inside.

923
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,359
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

924
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,919
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

925
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,390
A blow to Pearl would devastate the
Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.

926
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,517
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

927
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,591
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

928
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,877
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

929
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,635
No, sir. I understand my job
is to gather and interpret material.

930
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,076
Making difficult decisions
based on incomplete information...

931
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:52,280
from my limited decoding ability
is your job, sir.

932
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,558
Then break the damn naval code, Captain,
so I can make a better decision.

933
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,473
Aye, sir. We are trying.

934
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,599
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

935
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,109
In case the optimism
of the Honolulu Advertiser...

936
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,634
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

937
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,678
what are General Short and the army
going to do about protecting my ships?

938
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,149
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbour...

939
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,196
we have fighter planes
here at Wheeler...

940
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,236
bombers at Hickam
and a training strip at Haleiwa.

941
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,551
We've recently established
a radar station here that
can detect planes 125 miles out.

942
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,790
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

943
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,633
I've seen these
new radar screens, Major.

944
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,792
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs
or a flock of damn birds.

945
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,512
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo
to somewhere close by Pearl.

946
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,433
There's a call from Tokyo.
They say they don't know you.

947
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,356
Hello?

948
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,792
It's a local dentist. He can see
Pearl Harbor from his office.

949
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,836
"Are there many sailors around?"

950
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:35,753
Uh, the dentist says that
the flat ships are not in port.

951
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,434
They're talking about the weather.

952
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,556
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

953
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,278
Hello?

954
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,396
Hello?

955
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,118
Hello?

956
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,399
That was a strange call.

957
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,278
Admiral, may I speak to you
in private?

958
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,193
Why would a spy use a phone?

959
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,838
They know we tap
all international lines.

960
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,831
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

961
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,831
It sounds like someone in japan
is sneaking around...

962
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,831
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

963
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,115
Well, that makes me
feel all warm inside.

964
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,873
Get the FBI on it immediately.

965
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,110
Have we found
the goddam japanese fleet yet?

966
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,589
No, Admiral, the bases
are looking all over the Pacific.

967
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,432
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head right now.

968
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,511
We wouldn't know a thing about it.

969
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,750
Get on it.

970
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,716
I'm alive.

971
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,791
This is the first
I could get word out.

972
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,875
I told you I'd come back.

973
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,836
Here. Sit down.
Sit down. Come here.

974
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,309
It's okay.

975
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,471
It's all right.

976
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,959
- You're real.
- Yeah.

977
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,232
- I wished for this every day.
- I know. Me too.

978
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,788
Every second, so did I.

979
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,793
I thought you were dead. They--
They said you were shot down in the sea.

980
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,950
Yeah, I was.

981
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,873
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

982
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,951
I missed you.

983
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,669
I got picked up by a--
a French fishing boat, and I--

984
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,194
I was in Occupied France.
I couldn't get word out.

985
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,236
I'll tell you all about it.
I promise.

986
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,836
But I'm fine. I'm okay,
and I'm here now.

987
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,789
I just wanted to see you.
You're so beautiful.

988
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,916
I love you.

989
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,752
I love you.

990
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,679
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

991
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,716
Evelyn-- Evelyn, I'm back.

992
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,112
It's okay.
I won't leave you again. I promise.

993
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,318
Rafe, you died.

994
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,439
So did I.

995
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,308
I know, but I'm-- I'm--
It's fine now. I'm back.

996
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,873
We're together.

997
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,636
I mean, we are together, right?

998
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,277
I don't know where I am.

999
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,278
Rafe.

1000
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,156
Rafe?

1001
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,716
Stay away.

1002
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,711
Rafe!

1003
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,277
This is Radio Honolulu,
playing the sweetest music...

1004
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,432
on the sweetest island
in the Pacific.

1005
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,875
It's a beautiful December 6
with beautiful music...

1006
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,758
from the beautiful beach
of Waikiikii.

1007
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,879
- Rafe!
- Rafe!

1008
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,632
Oh! God damn it.
There you go.

1009
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,711
A real live ace!

1010
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,514
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.'s.

1011
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,114
- And I got two smokers too.
They don't count them.
- Oh, sorry.

1012
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,509
Of course, I got shot down myself
before they could pin me.

1013
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,478
You got back from behind enemy lines,
huh? What was that combat like?

1014
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,233
- Were you scared?
- Hey! One at a time.

1015
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,833
Oh, fine.

1016
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,596
Well, them Luftwaffe boys can
fly pretty good. It's not like,
you know, training. They're, uh--

1017
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,791
- Danny.
- You know, they're all
about tactics is what it is.

1018
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,598
You see, the Nazis, right?
They're faster than you are.

1019
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,750
So they'll disappear,
and they get up in the soup.

1020
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,116
They'll throw like
a roll or a hammerhead and
come around your high side, you know.

1021
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,998
Shoot you from behind,
like some Americans will.

1022
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,158
Hey, Gooz, you're
lookin' at a real live ace.

1023
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,470
Well, let me give you
the shirt off my back.

1024
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,998
- Aloha! There you go!
- I'll take it from you!

1025
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,991
You all are having
a pretty good time out here.

1026
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,399
Hey, Rafe,
we got to talk, all right?

1027
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,233
Ain't got nothing
to talk about with you. Here.

1028
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,834
Why don't you have a drink?

1029
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,070
I'll make a toast.

1030
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,116
To returnin' from the dead.

1031
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,634
Wasn't all I expected,
but, well, that's life.

1032
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,595
And to-- to my best friend
and loyal buddy Danny...

1033
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,070
for keeping up the war effort
back here at home.

1034
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,879
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.
- That was good.

1035
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,876
You know, where I come from,
somebody makes a toast to you...

1036
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,871
and you don't drink,
that's sayin' somethin'.

1037
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,960
All right, Rafe,
that's how it's gonna be.

1038
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,273
- To you.
- Hey, you guys need to spend
some time alone, I think.

1039
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,316
Oh, hell, no, Red. Come on.

1040
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,834
What are you talking--
No, no, no. We're celebrating here.

1041
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,876
Me over there fightin'.

1042
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,871
Almost gettin' killed.

1043
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,794
My friend Danny back here,
looking after my interests for me.

1044
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,350
You all know Danny was
even good enough to look out for
my girl for me while I was gone.

1045
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,079
We thought you were dead, Rafe,
and it gutted us both...

1046
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,720
and we were just trying
to get on with our lives.

1047
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,279
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

1048
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,430
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.

1049
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,353
Yeah, well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.

1050
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,914
You left her to fight
somebody else's war.

1051
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,798
And you made damn sure
that I didn't go with ya,
and we thought that you were dead!

1052
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,110
I almost did die,
you little son of a bitch.

1053
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,236
Her face was the last thing
that went through my mind.

1054
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,231
So don't stand there and tell me
to act like it's all right.

1055
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,880
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.

1056
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,520
I stayed, and you made sure of that,
and some things changed.

1057
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,433
- I hope you can get used to that.
- Oh, I have to get used to it.

1058
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,715
- Yeah.
- All right.

1059
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,392
We'll see how
I can get used to it.

1060
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,476
- Get used to that, boy.
- Hey!

1061
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,471
- And that's my left hand too.
- Hey, hey, hey!

1062
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,516
Come on!

1063
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,595
Melee at the Hula-la! Send MP's!

1064
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,672
You called me a lousy friend?

1065
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,118
Shit!

1066
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,553
Come on!

1067
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,632
- Let's go get 'em!
- Move out!

1068
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,193
Oh, they're gonna throw us
in the brig. Let's go.

1069
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,511
Oh, shit.

1070
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,837
Rafe, you're
the only family I got.

1071
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,276
When you were gone, it was
the loneliest I'd ever been.

1072
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,271
The same for her too.

1073
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,715
Oh, boy, now you're
really breaking my heart.

1074
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,870
If you hadn't gone,
none of this would have happened.

1075
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,758
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.

1076
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,354
Damn it, Rafe.

1077
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,632
I just know there's
got to be some way...

1078
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,757
we can work
things out so that...

1079
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,751
things can be right
between me and you.

1080
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,680
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.

1081
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,799
Revered father...

1082
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,997
I go now to fulfil
my mission and my destiny.

1083
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,313
I hope it is a destiny
that will bring honour to our family.

1084
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,834
And if it requires my life...

1085
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,549
I will sacrifice it gladly
to be a good servant of our nation.

1086
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,872
Hey, I got a large haze.

1087
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,511
That's too big to be planes, right?

1088
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,229
Is that what you want to do?
Knight to knight five?

1089
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,038
Boom! Wrong move.

1090
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,112
Lieutenant! Radar's picking up a large
return moving in from the northeast.

1091
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,918
Hang on.

1092
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,150
Relax. It's a flight of B-17's
coming in from the mainland.

1093
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,672
Nothing to worry about.

1094
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,239
Heck of a lot of B-1 7's.

1095
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,038
Good shot, Hot.

1096
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,998
This better be good, Commander.

1097
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,392
One of our destroyers reports having
fired and sunk enemy submarine...

1098
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,790
attempting to enter
Pearl Harbor at 0653.

1099
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,916
- It's 7:20.
- We had decoder delays, Admiral.

1100
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,638
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.

1101
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,238
"Failure--

1102
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,959
Peace talks useless."

1103
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,196
Thurman here. Tokyo transmitting
to their embassy in Washington.

1104
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,511
"Discontinue use of your decoding
machine and dispose of immediately.

1105
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,070
Special emphasis on destroying important
parts." Do you read that? Acknowledge.

1106
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,830
Admiral, Naval Intel intercepted
a transmission from Tokyo...

1107
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,638
to the japanese embassy
in Washington...

1108
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,075
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines...

1109
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,435
and burn all secret documents.

1110
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,557
The japanese are expectin' a war.

1111
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,993
Should we?

1112
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,838
Warning of possible japanese
aggressive movement in any direction.

1113
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,879
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent." But where?

1114
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,515
Did you ever
lose a fight, Miller?

1115
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,592
I been lucky so far, Captain.

1116
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,671
From what I hear, it ain't luck.

1117
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,479
Ship's proud of you, son.

1118
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,754
Come on.

1119
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,871
Come on, come on, come on.

1120
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,996
How do you like that?

1121
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,398
Why the hell is the navy doing
practice this early on a Sunday?

1122
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,711
- Heads up!
- Where's that coming from?

1123
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,518
Get down!

1124
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,868
Go! Go, go, go!

1125
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,635
I'm with navy newsreel, and I can tell
you one thing! Them ain't navy planes!

1126
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,833
-All hands, man your battle stations!
-We're being bombed! We're being bombed!
Get up! Get up!

1127
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,309
All hands,
man your battle stations.

1128
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,678
Jesus Christ!

1129
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,552
- Man your battle stations!
All hands, man your battle stations.
- Another dumb drill.

1130
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,029
- All hands, man your battle stations!
- What the heck was that?

1131
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,156
- It's a bomb!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

1132
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,199
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

1133
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,636
Son of a b--

1134
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,479
Go! Go!

1135
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,630
Get me the engine room!

1136
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,312
My God.

1137
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,470
Take cover!

1138
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,949
Down! Down!

1139
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,918
- Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!
- Man your battle stations.

1140
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,513
Man your battle stations!

1141
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,194
This is no shit!
They just sunk the Arizona!

1142
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,350
- General quarters! General quarters!
- Hustle! Hustle!

1143
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,477
All hands, man your battle stations!
This is no damn drill!

1144
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,392
- jap planes!
- Go! Go!

1145
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,113
They look like japs.

1146
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,668
I didn't even know
the japs were sore at us.

1147
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,671
Danny, you just get me
into a goddam aeroplane.

1148
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,557
Holy jesus!

1149
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,632
Oh, my God! This is good footage.
Did you see that?

1150
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,711
Holy cow!

1151
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,597
I hope there's still
an airfield left.

1152
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,391
- Hurry up!
- What in the world?

1153
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,871
Look. So many.

1154
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,991
Everybody to the hospital!

1155
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,951
Why is the navy always buzzin' us?

1156
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,113
Shut up, Red!

1157
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,432
- Hey, come on.
- Red, it's too early for this.

1158
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,351
The japs are here!

1159
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,198
- What the hell?
- Let's go! Let's go!

1160
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,430
Get outta here!

1161
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,875
Run! Run!

1162
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,830
- It's the japs!
- Take cover!
- Get down!

1163
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:11,192
- Take cover!
- Let's go! Hurry up!

1164
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,635
- General quarters!
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain.

1165
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,879
Repair says third deck
is flooding port side.

1166
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,679
Look out!

1167
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:46,595
Get up! Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight! Move it!

1168
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,232
- Incoming!
- Take cover!

1169
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,356
Go, go, go!

1170
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,749
Oh, my God!

1171
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,040
- I got you, Captain.
- You radio for air cover!

1172
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,552
Initiate damage control.

1173
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,438
Find my XO!
Tell him to assume command!

1174
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,195
- And you make sure the gunners--
- Everyone is where
they need to be, Captain.

1175
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,748
You trained us well.

1176
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,513
You trained us well.

1177
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,318
Captain?

1178
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,756
Okay.

1179
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,268
Get down now!

1180
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,396
Oh, my God!

1181
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,072
Go, go, go! Go!

1182
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,516
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody move! Let's move it!

1183
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,272
Get to the guns!

1184
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,194
Get the ammo for that 50 cal!
Get that 50 cal!

1185
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,077
Let's get a fuel hook-up!

1186
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,111
- Let's go! We're gotta get--
- Hey!

1187
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,269
Come on, man!
We gotta get this thing loaded up!

1188
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,353
Get to the planes!

1189
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,198
Let's go! Let's go!

1190
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,475
- Get the fuel.
- Help!

1191
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,471
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1192
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,398
Come on! Get down!

1193
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,516
Down! Down!

1194
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,795
Get to the planes!
Get to the planes!

1195
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,550
Come on!

1196
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,512
Get down!

1197
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,869
Danny, get me into a damn plane.

1198
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,871
Come on!

1199
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,998
- Planes coming in!
- Get down!

1200
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,199
Get some ammo up here!
We need to man these guns!

1201
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,113
Sir! Captain says
you're in charge, sir!

1202
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,159
We need more ammo! Now!

1203
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,629
Send up ammunition
for the five-inch guns.

1204
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,150
- Medic!
- All of'em! Now!

1205
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,559
Send everything you got!

1206
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,993
Come on!

1207
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,629
Come on!

1208
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,158
Come on, you sum'bitch!

1209
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,354
Oh, yeah!

1210
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,351
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!

1211
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,396
Take a deep breath!
Come on! Breathe!

1212
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,238
Get to the supply room!

1213
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,078
Get everything out!

1214
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,592
Planes incoming!

1215
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,155
Cut 'em down!

1216
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,749
Come on! Come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!

1217
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,229
Get against the wall!

1218
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,674
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!

1219
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,671
Take cover!

1220
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:11,274
- Is everybody all right?
- Can you stand?

1221
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,032
Come on! Help 'em out!

1222
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,879
- Hold your fire!
- Get to the guns! Hurry up!

1223
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,313
Get down, Danny!

1224
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,109
- Earl!
- This is Walker.

1225
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,953
We need to get those planes
fuelled and loaded right now!

1226
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,270
- What's going on out there, huh?
- Danny, what the hell's that noise?

1227
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,351
You guys doing target practice
or something?

1228
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,192
I think World War II just hit us.

1229
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,351
- Get down!
- Go, go, go!

1230
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,432
- Billy!
- Run!

1231
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,556
Bomb!

1232
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:02,629
It's a dud.

1233
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,551
- It's a bomb!
- It's a dud!

1234
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,989
Get down!

1235
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,030
- Danny! Danny, you all right?
- I'm all right!

1236
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:21,112
Come on! Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
Gooz, come on, man!

1237
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,108
We're sinking! We're sinking!

1238
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,917
Stay together!
Close the hatches!

1239
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,470
- I can't swim!
- You hang on!

1240
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,115
Move it! Now!

1241
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,952
Joe! Go! Go!

1242
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,349
- Come on!
- We're gettin' out of here!
Get in the car!

1243
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,670
Get in! Get in!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1244
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,228
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1245
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,159
- Where's this place we're goin'?
- We got a small mechanic runway
about 1 0 minutes away.

1246
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,514
Hasn't been hit yet.

1247
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,598
Zeros on our six!

1248
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,673
Duck!

1249
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,869
We're trapped.

1250
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,599
Try-- Try the door!

1251
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,588
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be under!
I'm gonna be under!

1252
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:35,075
- It's sucking me back!
- The current's too strong!

1253
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,271
Watch it!
They're still shootin' us!

1254
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,036
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

1255
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:31,472
- This is it.
- Help! There's no way out!

1256
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,919
How bad?

1257
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,911
It's still not over, sir.

1258
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,674
An entire fleet at anchor.

1259
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,868
My God. My God.

1260
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,559
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine!

1261
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,272
Fill up the kitchen!
Fill up the ki--

1262
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,271
Are you listening to me?
Fill up the kitchen!

1263
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,751
Over there!
Over there!

1264
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,031
- Bad neck wound here!
We got a dire neck wound!
- Surgery!

1265
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,951
Go! We've got to
get him to surgery!

1266
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,996
Oh, God. In here.

1267
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,474
Guy's still bleeding.
Give me another haemostat.

1268
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,790
Hurry! Haemostat!
Give me a haemostat now!

1269
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,709
Hurry!

1270
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,838
Give me another haemostat.
Give me another suture.

1271
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,151
- Oh, God! I'm so sorry!
- Hurry it up!

1272
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,797
- Doctor!
- Here it is!

1273
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,956
Am I gonna die?
Am I gonna die?

1274
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,553
Nurse!

1275
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,598
- Don't leave me!
- Doctor, get over here!

1276
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,195
My fingers
are plugging his artery.

1277
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,238
Doctor, what do you need?

1278
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,470
Doctor, focus. Look at me.
What do you need?

1279
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:03,596
- H-H-H-Haemostat.
- Haemostat.

1280
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,629
Here. All right.
Look at me.

1281
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,393
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

1282
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:23,555
I need more ammo!
I need more ammo, ladies!

1283
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,631
I need more ammo!

1284
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,837
- Earl! We good to go?
- Yeah, mostly, but--

1285
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,832
- Get down! Get down!
- Shit! Take cover!
- Oh, jeez--

1286
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:37,149
Oh, my God!
Earl, get in here!

1287
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,759
Hey, Sergeant! They come back around,
we're gonna need more than a shotgun.

1288
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,195
You got any other weapons and ammo
you can lay us some cover fire?

1289
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,838
Yeah, inside that ammo locker!

1290
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,673
Come on! Let's go! Move it!

1291
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,309
Go! Go! Go!
Gimme a gun, goddam it!

1292
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,551
You said the planes were
mostly ready "but." But what?

1293
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:59,074
Well, she's down, she's broke,
she's shit. I got four left.

1294
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:01,435
One's good to go,
two need ammo, one needs fuel.

1295
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,556
Fall out.
Load up in the bunker.

1296
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:06,393
- Let's go! Get down!
- Move!
- Come on!

1297
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,631
- Get ready to roll.
- Get down! Down!

1298
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,597
All right, Anthony, Red...

1299
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,433
you two are gonna
stay here and man the 50-calibre.

1300
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,274
Gooz, you get up to the next bunker
and you lay down some cover fire,
all right?

1301
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,349
Planes!

1302
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,830
Should we fire?

1303
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,797
Stay down! Stay down!
No, goddam it, hold your fire!

1304
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:29,475
- Stay still. Nobody fire.
- Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Hold your fire.

1305
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,468
They don't know we're here.

1306
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,676
- Stay down.
- We can fire.
- No, no, no, no, no, goddam it.

1307
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,354
They don't know we're here.
Stay down. Stay still. Don't fire.

1308
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,149
Oh, God.

1309
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:58,034
I don't see any ordinance.
I think they're goin' home.

1310
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,714
No, they'll be back. We still
got planes on the ground.

1311
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,349
All right, you pilots, listen up.
Get all the airspeed you can
coming off the runway.

1312
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,556
Don't get on the stick
till you get to the very end.

1313
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,279
When you get in the air,
stay low between the buildings.

1314
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,750
You see any Zero on your tail,
try to wipe him off. Don't freeze.

1315
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,116
All right? just keep moving.
We're gonna try to break 'em up
and separate 'em.

1316
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,668
- That way we can take 'em out
one by one.
- All right.

1317
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,910
P-40s can't outrun Zeros,
so don't try.

1318
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,991
We're just gonna
have to outfly 'em.

1319
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:26,072
We got high-level bombers. They're
gonna bust this hangar wide open.

1320
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:29,835
- Grab the 50s! Let's move!
- Okay!
- Let's go! Let's go!

1321
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,878
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

1322
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,512
- Let's go!
- Zeros!

1323
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,835
Take cover! Take cover!

1324
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,030
Go! Faster!

1325
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:52,394
Take cover! Take cover!

1326
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:05,994
- Get down! Get down! Get down!
- Gooz, Danny, come on!

1327
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,589
Get in there!

1328
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,918
Danny!

1329
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:29,672
Come on!
Come on, buddy!

1330
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,433
Leave him! He's dead!
He's dead!

1331
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,798
- All right, they're kickin' our butt.
Get to the aeroplanes! Let's go!
- Let's go!

1332
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,678
- Come on. Go, go, go!
- Get up!

1333
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,035
- Danny, let's run!
- Red, Anthony, let's go!

1334
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,957
Hey! Come on! Help me!

1335
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,476
Let's do it, Anthony!
Come on!

1336
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,557
- Knock 'em dead.
- Here. Get in.
Here. Put these on.

1337
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,594
They're coming around, boys!
Pick it up! Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1338
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,714
Red, get outta here, goddam it!
I'm all right. Go! Go!

1339
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,470
Come on, come on. Let's go.

1340
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,358
- joe, get out the way!
- I'm rollin'! I'm rollin'!

1341
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,238
Clear, clear! Go!

1342
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,594
Planes!

1343
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,555
Help me, damn it!

1344
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:47,911
Hey,joe.joe, you got three Zeros
right behind you! You got
three Zeros on your six!

1345
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,199
Turn! Turn!

1346
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:00,269
Oh, God!

1347
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:14,877
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doing?
Get goin'! Get movin'!

1348
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,951
Danny, start that thing up
and get in the air, now.

1349
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,792
I'm not much good
without a wingman.

1350
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,438
- I need you.
- I got you.

1351
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:24,031
Let's do it!

1352
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:44,113
It's real tight, Rafe.
It's real tight.

1353
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,951
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!

1354
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,917
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt!

1355
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,070
Don't freeze.
Don't freeze.

1356
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,628
I don't think I'm gonna
make it up over this.

1357
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,836
Get up! Get up!

1358
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,559
We did it! I'm up!

1359
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,318
We got Zeros behind us, Rafe!

1360
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,516
How many you see back there?

1361
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:36,109
We got five on our six!

1362
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,957
Take it down
to the deck, Danny! Now!

1363
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,674
We gotta split 'em up, Danny.

1364
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,832
You take left,
I'll take right.

1365
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,199
Earl, you better get some guns
in that goddam tower up there!

1366
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,511
Okay, okay. Let's go!
Get to the truck! Let's go! Follow me!

1367
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:14,833
Danny, I got three on my six!

1368
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,192
Whoo!

1369
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:38,357
Stop it! Stop it! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red.

1370
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,359
- Let's go. Move it!
- Gimme the 50!

1371
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,800
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1372
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,431
I still got two
behind me, Rafe.

1373
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,035
Coming in! Take cover!

1374
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,835
Son of a bitch!

1375
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,038
No!

1376
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,633
Earl, do you hear me, goddam it?
Get some guns in that tower!

1377
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:21,076
On the tower. Yeah.
Goin' ten storeys up.
It's a long son of a bitch.

1378
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,749
- Look! Look!
- Move it!

1379
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,876
Rafe, they're all over me.
I can't get 'em off me!

1380
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:42,188
Danny, I still got three on my tail.

1381
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:49,272
- Keep jinkin' it.
Don't let 'em get a handle on you.
- I can't shake 'em, Rafe.

1382
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,828
Damn it.

1383
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:54,388
Danny, let's play some chicken
with these jap suckers.

1384
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,675
All right, I'm with you.

1385
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,749
Jesus!

1386
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,279
- I'm comin' right at you, Rafe.
- Don't break till I tell you. Hold on.

1387
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,351
Not yet. Not yet!

1388
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,998
Come on! Come on!

1389
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,235
Go left, now!

1390
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,398
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Whoo! Ha-ha-ha!

1391
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,835
Set up over there!

1392
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,879
Come on. Load it.

1393
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:28,155
Okay, we're at the top of the tower.

1394
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,754
Earl, I got one on my tail.
I'm gonna bring him right by you.

1395
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,435
He's comin' around! He's comin' around!
Let's get this jap sucker!

1396
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,676
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
Here he comes.

1397
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,156
You better be cocked
and locked when I come by there.

1398
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,232
Hold your fire.

1399
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:50,628
Fire!

1400
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,791
Whoo!
Good shootin', boys!

1401
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,438
Nice job, Earl.

1402
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,034
- Now, let's head over
to Battleship Row.
- I'm with you.

1403
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,118
Let's go do some business.

1404
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,109
I'm goin' after 'em.

1405
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:29,792
Rafe, I got him!

1406
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:33,350
- Oh, yeah!
- P-40s!
- Yeah!

1407
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:39,872
They're pullin' out into the clouds,
Danny. We ain't gonna let
these sons of bitches get home.

1408
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,758
How do you like it
when someone's shootin' back at you?

1409
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,354
Oh, I'm on your ass now.

1410
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,632
Danny, I got one!

1411
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,271
Come on.

1412
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,235
Ah! Come on!

1413
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:32,069
Come on. Stay in there.
Stay in there!

1414
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,476
Whoa!

1415
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,391
I got you, son of a bitch!

1416
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,951
Who taught you
how to fly, Lieutenant?

1417
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,109
He did.

1418
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:42,352
All right, Bobby, don't kick.
I know it's hard, but--

1419
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:45,955
- I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!
- You're not gonna die!

1420
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,110
I got you.
Can you hold on to this--

1421
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,316
Sandra, we're running out
of morphine, so you gotta--

1422
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,436
you gotta mark 'em,
you gotta find some way to mark 'em...

1423
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,988
so we can keep track of who's got--
got the morphine already.

1424
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,799
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

1425
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:03,193
- It's not marking. It's not ma--
Ev, you got a marker?
- Uh, uh, no.

1426
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:07,238
Use my lipstick.
Put M for morphine.

1427
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,880
- Evelyn, we need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet?

1428
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,270
Where are the clamps?
Hurry.

1429
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,516
There's nothing left.

1430
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:25,112
- Evelyn.
- Here. Use this.
- I need you to go outside.

1431
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,509
There's too many to help.
Okay? You gotta sort 'em out.

1432
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:30,160
Only those that can be saved,
you bring in here. You got that?

1433
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:32,276
- I can't.
- No, please, do it!

1434
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,396
I need you to do it. Go! Go!

1435
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,519
- Don't let in anyone without a mark.
- Stay back!

1436
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,797
- I told you, stand back!
- Stay outside. Keep 'em outside.

1437
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,316
Come on! Let's go!
Take this guy up!

1438
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:15,917
- Wait here.
- Don't touch me, you jap!
Get your hands off me!

1439
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,833
- He's critical. Get him into Critical!
- Keep him off me. Keep him off me!

1440
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,239
Critical, front ward!

1441
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,595
How bad am I?

1442
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:27,513
- You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart.
- I don't wanna die!
- You're gonna be just fine.

1443
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:30,558
You're not gonna die, sweetheart.
I got your hand.

1444
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,556
Give him enough morphine
to make him comfortable.
He's not gonna make it.

1445
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:36,552
Line the critical up in the ward.
Get him morphine. Take him over there.

1446
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:39,359
- Take the burn victims by the trees.
- I just found her.

1447
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:43,877
- I-I-I don't--
I don't think she's breathing.
- No, she's dead. Take her.

1448
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,875
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God!

1449
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,270
Oh, are you sure, Ev?
Could you check her one more time
to be sure?

1450
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,874
She's dead, Sandra, she's dead.
Take her over there.

1451
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:58,520
- You've got to be sure before you--
- She's dead. Get back to work.
- Oh, my God!

1452
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,511
Go back to work, Sandra.

1453
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,870
I don't know what to do.

1454
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,559
- Over here!
- Admiral?

1455
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,437
From Washington.

1456
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:40,316
"Attack by japan considered imminent."

1457
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:46,951
They're only an hour late.

1458
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:46,195
- How can we help?
- We need blood. Come on.

1459
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,196
Remember, son,
hold on to your faith.

1460
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,316
- 1,500 cartons over there.
- Remember what jesus said:

1461
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,870
"Today you will be with me
in paradise." So fear not.

1462
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,871
Fear not, my son.

1463
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,349
You are a man truly blessed.
Truly blessed.

1464
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,431
You will die
in a state of grace.

1465
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,756
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.

1466
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,796
Hold on to your faith, my son.

1467
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:13,316
You will be with God and all
the saints, all the angels very soon.

1468
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:15,675
I absolve you of your sins
in the name of the Father...

1469
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,751
and of the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

1470
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,439
Amen.

1471
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:31,111
Go with God, my son.

1472
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,191
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbour.

1473
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,111
We need help
from anybody who can move.

1474
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:43,350
Don't lose us!
Keep swimming!

1475
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,912
- Get us outta here!
- Help!

1476
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,992
There's somebody in here!
Get somebody down here!

1477
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,108
- They're cuttin' through!
- Yeah!

1478
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,234
Get us outta here!

1479
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:04,312
I hear somebody!
Let's get some guys over here!

1480
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,231
Pull!

1481
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,792
- Get us outta here!
- The room's filling up with water!

1482
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:13,438
Get an air line in here!

1483
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,791
- Help us! Hurry!
- The air hose!

1484
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:18,915
What can we do?

1485
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,719
It won't cut any faster!

1486
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,468
Cut 'em out!

1487
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,192
Yesterday...

1488
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:07,989
December 7, 1941...

1489
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:12,238
a date which will live
in infamy...

1490
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:18,236
the United States of America was
suddenly and deliberately attacked...

1491
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,675
by naval and air forces...

1492
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,637
of the Empire of japan.

1493
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:27,957
It is obvious
that planning the attack...

1494
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:30,508
began many weeks ago.

1495
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:33,512
During the intervening time...

1496
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:36,672
the Japanese government
has deliberately sought...

1497
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,751
to deceive the United States...

1498
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:42,515
by false statements
and expressions of hope...

1499
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,558
for continued peace.

1500
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:50,395
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands...

1501
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:55,190
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.

1502
02:02:55,280 --> 02:03:00,035
I regret to tell you
that over 3, 000 American lives...

1503
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,350
have been lost.

1504
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:04,954
No matter how long
it may take us...

1505
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:08,476
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

1506
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,552
the American people
in their righteous might...

1507
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,993
will win through...

1508
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,150
to absolute victory.

1509
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,151
Because of this...

1510
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:24,869
unprovoked, dastardly attacked
by Japan...

1511
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,714
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.

1512
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,316
Is it true...

1513
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:39,392
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?

1514
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:43,276
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

1515
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:46,591
We're doing everything
we can to get to them,
but they're 40 feet below water.

1516
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,270
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible...

1517
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:59,200
and now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...

1518
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,669
by an enemy
we considered inferior.

1519
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:05,435
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

1520
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,115
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

1521
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,873
We're preparing an attack against
the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir,
to keep our--

1522
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:15,555
I'm talking about hitting the heart
of japan the way they have hit us.

1523
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,875
Mr President,
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares...

1524
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:22,678
because we didn't face facts.

1525
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:25,593
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

1526
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,911
The Army Air Corps has long-range
bombers but no place to launch them.

1527
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,673
Midway is too far,
and Russia...

1528
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,990
won't allow us
to launch a raid from there.

1529
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,675
- Admiral?
- The navy's planes are small.

1530
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,512
They carry light loads
and have a short range.

1531
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:42,239
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles ofjapan...

1532
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:45,232
and therefore risk our carriers,
and if we lose our carriers...

1533
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,390
we'll have no shield
against invasion.

1534
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,072
Does anyone in this room...

1535
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:51,913
think that victory is possible
without facing danger?

1536
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,912
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.

1537
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,070
But consider the risk,
Mr President.

1538
02:04:57,160 --> 02:04:59,594
If the japanese
invade us right now...

1539
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,717
they would penetrate as far
as Chicago before we could stop them.

1540
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:06,473
Gentlemen...

1541
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:11,991
most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

1542
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:16,836
I was strong and proud
and arrogant.

1543
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,473
Now I wonder
every hour of my life...

1544
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,028
why God put me
into this chair.

1545
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,550
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my countrymen...

1546
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:32,839
in your eyes right now, I start to think
that maybe he brought me down...

1547
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:36,799
for times like these when we all need
to be reminded who we truly are--

1548
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,633
that we will not give up
or give in.

1549
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,312
Mr President,
with all respect, sir.

1550
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:43,231
What you're asking can't be done.

1551
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:02,193
- Mr President--
- Mr President!
- Get back, George. Get back.

1552
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,435
Do not tell me...

1553
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,431
it can't be done.

1554
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:27,235
Japan continues its military conquest
throughout the Pacific.

1555
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:31,280
But, back home,
millions ofAmerican workers...

1556
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:35,273
band together, bringing factories
to life to avenge Pearl Harbor.

1557
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:43,349
Mr President, I think we have an idea
about how to bomb the japanese.

1558
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,398
Sir, it's risky, but it's bold.

1559
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:50,239
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

1560
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,231
Captain Low, Mr President.

1561
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:55,470
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea, sir.

1562
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:57,994
I like sub commanders.

1563
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:01,675
They don't have time for bullshit,
and neither do I.

1564
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,478
Fire away, gentlemen.

1565
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,111
And where is God in all this?

1566
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:26,430
Our enemies believe
that a divine wind protects them.

1567
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:30,154
But we see our friends
laid out here before us--

1568
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:53,719
Hey, Cap'n.

1569
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:19,032
- Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker?
- Major.

1570
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:22,349
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

1571
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:23,634
What for, sir?

1572
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:25,278
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

1573
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,114
Yes, sir.

1574
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:35,519
Over there.

1575
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,431
Packing.

1576
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,709
Orders.

1577
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,712
What kind of orders?

1578
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,870
The top secret kind.

1579
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,633
Dangerous kind.

1580
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:02,353
I, uh, can't find Danny.

1581
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,989
That why you're here?
Looking for Danny?

1582
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:10,670
He's probably
saying goodbye to his squadron.
We've been assigned to Doolittle.

1583
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,191
I wasn't looking for Danny.

1584
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:28,872
I couldn't have you go away
without you understanding something.

1585
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,550
Yeah, well, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

1586
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:39,632
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

1587
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:43,912
Evelyn, loving you
kept me alive.

1588
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,950
I should've died over there.

1589
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,077
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

1590
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:03,911
I told Him I was sorry.

1591
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,434
I told Him I knew I'd been
a fool for leaving you...

1592
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,432
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

1593
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,670
and I promised I'd never
ask for anything again...

1594
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:15,636
if I could just see you
one more time.

1595
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:20,832
You know what?

1596
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:23,519
It was worth it.

1597
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:28,638
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

1598
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:32,116
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.

1599
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:35,590
I'm gonna walk away,
and I won't ask you for anything.

1600
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,672
But I just wanna know why.

1601
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:41,718
Just tell me that, will you, please?
Just tell me why.

1602
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:45,391
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

1603
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,519
Oh, my God.

1604
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:01,952
I didn't even know until the day
you turned up alive.

1605
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,831
And then all this happened.

1606
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:10,312
I haven't told Danny.

1607
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,311
I don't want him to know.

1608
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:16,632
All he needs to think about is how
to do this mission and get back alive.

1609
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,357
Rafe, all I ever wanted
was for us to have a home...

1610
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:28,797
and grow old together, but life
never asked me what I wanted.

1611
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:31,440
Now I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

1612
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:37,993
but I don't think I'll ever look at
another sunset without thinking of you.

1613
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:43,671
I'll love you my whole life.

1614
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:21,671
I'll see you on board.

1615
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:41,114
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

1616
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:44,915
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

1617
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:50,632
I love you, Danny...

1618
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:54,628
and I'll be here
waiting for you when you come back.

1619
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:13,268
Follow me.

1620
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,159
Colonel.

1621
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:25,232
- Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.
- I heard what you did.

1622
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:27,151
We can explain that, sir.

1623
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:28,958
Explain what?

1624
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:31,679
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

1625
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:34,479
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

1626
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:40,631
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

1627
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,036
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

1628
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:48,912
and promoted to captain.

1629
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,671
Is that the good news, sir, or--

1630
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:56,036
You're just about the only pilots
in the army with combat experience.

1631
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,351
I need you for a mission
I've been ordered to put together.

1632
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:05,116
- You know what top secret is?
- Yes, sir.

1633
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:07,589
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

1634
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:09,591
But they send them
to your relatives.

1635
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:11,636
Top secret means
you train for something...

1636
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:14,234
never done before
in aviation history...

1637
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:16,231
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

1638
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,035
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

1639
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,348
I'll go, sir.

1640
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:25,032
I'll go too, sir.

1641
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:28,637
By the way, McCawley,
the Brits sent this over.

1642
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:31,109
- It's your personal effects.
- Thank you, sir.

1643
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,634
There's only one more thing
I can tell you.

1644
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:36,518
Leave your goddam hula shirts
at home.

1645
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:43,433
Dear Rafe, it's so strange
to be this far from you...

1646
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:47,035
but you should know this:
every night--

1647
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,190
I've been looking
all over for you.

1648
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:02,153
Danny, this-- this--

1649
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,629
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

1650
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:07,631
We gotta face facts here.

1651
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:11,759
The fact is, we just both
love the same woman.

1652
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:20,958
You know, she's the first girl
I ever felt this way about, Rafe.

1653
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:27,152
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

1654
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,829
This is different, though, Danny.

1655
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:36,549
Evelyn already lost the man she loved
once. I just don't want to see
that happen to her again.

1656
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:39,632
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.

1657
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:41,358
She knows that.

1658
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:44,989
Danny, don't do this.
Don't go on this mission.

1659
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:47,992
You got nothing to prove.

1660
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:51,511
You've been trying to protect me
since we were kids.

1661
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:56,635
Yeah, well, you do tend
to need it from time to time.

1662
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:18,949
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer
for is exceptionally dangerous.

1663
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,390
Take a look
at the man beside you.

1664
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,755
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...

1665
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:28,037
you or he...

1666
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:30,031
will be dead.

1667
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:34,595
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

1668
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:37,548
step forward.

1669
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:49,676
Your grandmother could take a B-25 off
on a mile-long runway.

1670
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:53,389
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

1671
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:57,751
Because at 468 feet...

1672
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,831
you're dead.

1673
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:03,310
And once you get it up, you're gonna
learn to fly it like a fighter...

1674
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:06,039
thirty feet off the ground.

1675
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,112
I want you to say hello to Lieutenant
Jack Richards, Navy Aviation.

1676
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:11,475
He's gonna help us lighten
these fat ladies here.

1677
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:15,750
Dump that ashcan.
See that bombsight? Get rid of it.

1678
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:19,435
- Colonel, he's crazy.
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.

1679
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:21,272
She's a fat lady.
We want a skinny lady.

1680
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,190
Max power!

1681
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:32,596
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1682
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:35,433
- Damn!
- How in the heck you--
- Damn!

1683
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,678
They just keep rolling
past that line.

1684
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:48,673
- Maybe this mission's a bad idea.
- No, they're too heavy. We got
to get drastic with these planes.

1685
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,273
This armoured plating's
got to go.

1686
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:53,989
- I'm sure. I'm sure.
Now, lose it like a skirt, son.
- Release brakes!

1687
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:57,919
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1688
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:03,469
- God!
- Put every man on the line now!

1689
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:07,996
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!

1690
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,831
Come on! Max power!

1691
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:19,877
Well, if he can do it--

1692
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:38,989
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you
that we're going to Tokyo.

1693
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:43,274
And we're gonna bomb it.

1694
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:52,158
That comes as a special request
directly from President Roosevelt.

1695
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:56,631
The navy's gonna sneak us about
400 miles off the japanese coast,
and we'll launch from the carrier there.

1696
02:18:56,720 --> 02:19:00,633
Has that ever even been done before?
Taking army bombers off a navy carrier?

1697
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:02,711
No.

1698
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:03,710
Okay.

1699
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:06,189
- Any other questions?
- Well, sir...

1700
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:09,636
is it even possible to land a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

1701
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:11,711
That won't matter.

1702
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:14,633
As soon as we're airborne, the carrier
will head straight back for Hawaii.

1703
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:16,836
But if the carriers head home,
where do we land?

1704
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:19,639
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

1705
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,429
It means "I am an American."

1706
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,552
In Chinese.

1707
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:34,759
Ain't gonna be any easier. That's three
feet shorter than our practice runway.

1708
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:36,751
- Fellas?
- Sir.

1709
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,239
Sir.

1710
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:45,078
- Secretary of the navy gave me these.
- What are they?

1711
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:48,550
Friendship medals the japanese gave us
when they were pretending
they wanted peace.

1712
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:52,428
- What do they want you
to do with them, sir?
- We're gonna wire them
to the bombs and give them back.

1713
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:59,592
- So what's going on?
- Well, sir, we only have 1 6 planes.

1714
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:00,829
So?

1715
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:03,559
When the japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

1716
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:06,200
I mean, how much difference
we really gonna make?

1717
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:11,354
It's not that we're afraid, sir.
It's just that we might die doing this,
and we wanna know what it's for.

1718
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:17,512
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

1719
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:22,437
This raid,
even ifwe make it through...

1720
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:25,034
it'll only be a pinprick.

1721
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:27,031
But it'll be straight
through their hearts.

1722
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:33,230
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most
and believe in it the longest.

1723
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:39,432
We're gonna believe. We're gonna
make America believe too.

1724
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:41,511
Colonel! I need a minute.

1725
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:47,755
- Excuse me, Major jackson.
- Yes.
- Do you remember me?

1726
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,999
Oh, sure I do. I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.

1727
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:54,752
Maybe you can.

1728
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:58,230
When the news starts coming in about
those boys in the Doolittle outfit...

1729
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:00,993
- I wanna be in the command post.
- I'm sorry.

1730
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:03,310
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

1731
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:08,152
How in the hell do you know
about this mission, Lieutenant?

1732
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,196
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.

1733
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:12,510
You mean some fly boy
you're dating shot his mouth off.

1734
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:16,515
Actually, It's about two pilots.

1735
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:18,830
I know they're going
into great danger.

1736
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:22,230
I just wanna be there
when the news comes in
to tell us if they've lived or died.

1737
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:28,671
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

1738
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:32,719
Most nurses would have gone on
to someone else instead of keeping
their fingers plugged in your artery.

1739
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:41,437
I can't promise you anything.

1740
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:46,230
One, two, three, one!
One, two, three, two!
One, two, three--

1741
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:51,519
Hey, Red, you think they just picked us
to do this 'cause we're young and dumb?

1742
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:55,231
Come on, Gooz.
We're the tip of the sword.

1743
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:16,156
All right,
in honour of our trip to japan,
I got us some, uh, victory cigars!

1744
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:18,959
Yeah, victory cigars!
There you go.

1745
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,076
Put that in your inside pocket
next to your heart.

1746
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:25,551
You know,jack, we may lose this battle,
but we're gonna win this war.

1747
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:27,631
- You know how I know?
- No.

1748
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:30,790
Them.

1749
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:34,600
Because they're rare.

1750
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:37,148
And in times like these,
you see them...

1751
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:39,869
stepping forward.

1752
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,911
There's nothing stronger
than the heart of a volunteer,jack.

1753
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:53,670
My friends in the War Department
don't want me to lead this raid...

1754
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,672
because they say I'm too valuable.

1755
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:00,719
They don't want me up in the air
flying with the men that I've chosen...

1756
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:04,110
that I've chewed out, cussed out,
pushed to the limit...

1757
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:08,831
and that I've come to respect.

1758
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:15,716
They want me to stand
in the flight deck and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.

1759
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:19,311
So I'm going with you.

1760
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:27,189
We take off tomorrow afternoon,
drop our fire and head for China.

1761
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:31,512
Our mission is to hit military targets,
aircraft and tank factories.

1762
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:32,589
Colonel...

1763
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:37,151
you've given us the homing beacons,
but you've also told us that China
is overrun with japanese troops.

1764
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:39,151
What do we do
if the beacons are switched off?

1765
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:42,232
You bring her down any way you can
and do your best to avoid capture.

1766
02:23:42,320 --> 02:23:45,198
What do we do if our planes are damaged
and we have to bail out over japan?

1767
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:49,478
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what you should do.

1768
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:51,357
What would you do, Colonel?

1769
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:56,510
I wasn't built to be a prisoner.

1770
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:01,271
So I would have my crew bail out.

1771
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:03,555
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

1772
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:06,996
and drive my plane
right smack into the middle of it.

1773
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:12,311
But that's just me.

1774
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,751
I'm 45 years old.
I'm an old man.

1775
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:20,116
You guys have
your whole lives ahead of you.

1776
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:22,111
So what you do is up to you.

1777
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:32,198
The mission will launch
in a couple ofhours.

1778
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:34,430
You'll stay right in here.

1779
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:40,956
Here. Stay here. Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.

1780
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,600
Pretend to type whatever information
we pass you. That's it.

1781
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:49,229
This is Orphan Annie
from Radio Tokyo...

1782
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:51,754
to all the lonely boys
in the South Pacific.

1783
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:55,753
- Watch out. The enemy will get you.
- Maybe she's ri ght.

1784
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:02,114
Japs transmitting!
Japs transmitting!

1785
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:06,830
Captain, Radar reports japanese
patrol boats range of 400 yards.

1786
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:08,990
- How many yards?
- 400 yards and closing, sir.

1787
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:11,992
Richards!japs! 400 yards.
Let's go!

1788
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:14,719
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire!

1789
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:17,519
We gotta sink these jap boats
before they give away our position.

1790
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:18,828
Go to general quarters!

1791
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:21,195
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1792
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:23,554
Oh, my God.

1793
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,153
This can't be good.

1794
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:28,390
All hands,
man yourbattle stations!

1795
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:35,277
Japs one mile away!
They've reported our position!

1796
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:38,033
We're supposed to launch 400 miles away.
How far are we now?

1797
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:39,599
624 miles.

1798
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:41,750
-jesus!
- What do you wanna do?

1799
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:44,638
624 miles--

1800
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,158
I don't know. Colonel...

1801
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:50,435
I don't know if the planes can carry
enough fuel to make it to China.

1802
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:53,356
Now. We launch now!

1803
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:56,956
Army pilots, man your planes!

1804
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,917
Man your planes!

1805
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,556
They're shooting at something.

1806
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:18,830
Colonel,
we're too far out to make it.

1807
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:21,912
These planes need more fuel,
but if they're too heavy,
they might not get off the deck.

1808
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,549
Listen. I want you to strip
everything out of this plane
you don't need, and I mean now.

1809
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,236
Start preflight. Let's go!

1810
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:31,880
Add ten more cans of fuel
for each plane.

1811
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:33,678
Every plane!

1812
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:39,952
- Let's go! Let's go! Move!
- Come on, you guys. Get up there!

1813
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:41,837
Lose those suitcases now!

1814
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:43,558
- What's your favourite gun?
- What?

1815
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:47,918
You wanna get off this deck,
you give me one of those guns now.
It's still too heavy.

1816
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:54,118
Yo. I want you to go to the kitchen,
get some broomsticks. Cut 'em down,
paint 'em black and bring 'em here.

1817
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:57,158
- You're gonna put a broomstick
where this gun was.
- A broomstick.

1818
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,832
Your plane's gonna be fine.

1819
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:01,639
You tell your crew to take a piss
before they take off, or they're
not gonna clear the deck.

1820
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:09,953
- We've got broomsticks for tail guns.
- Yeah, maybe it'll scare 'em.

1821
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:13,032
- You take care of yourself up there.
- Yeah. I will.

1822
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:15,998
Danny, be careful.
You hear me?

1823
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:20,232
- I will. I'll see you, Rafe.
- Rafe, we're the tip of the sword.

1824
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:29,272
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!

1825
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,397
All right.

1826
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:37,072
You ready for this?

1827
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,753
- Superchargers low and latched.
- Superchargers are low and latched.

1828
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:43,432
We're full into the wind.

1829
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,556
More speed! More speed!

1830
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:58,876
- Are you nervous?
- No-- Yes, sir. Yes.

1831
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:03,078
- When did you find religion?
- When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.

1832
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:05,310
- I want you to do me a favour.
- What's that, Colonel?

1833
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,755
- Pray for both of us.
- It's gotta be right!

1834
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:09,159
Let's go!

1835
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,511
Max power!

1836
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:23,030
Up, please!

1837
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:26,995
Come on! Come on!

1838
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:38,315
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

1839
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:42,431
Jesus, that was short.

1840
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,276
- Move 'em up!
- All right, full power!
Full power! Here we go!

1841
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:52,238
Come on!

1842
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:04,836
Come on! Here we go!
Here we go!

1843
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:17,395
We made it!

1844
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:39,078
From Berlin, Rome and Tokyo,
we have been described...

1845
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:41,993
as a nation
of weaklings and playboys...

1846
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:45,595
who hire British or Russian
or Chinese soldiers...

1847
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:48,035
to do our fighting for us.

1848
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:50,839
Let them repeat that now.

1849
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:54,276
Let them tell that
to General MacArthur and his men.

1850
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:57,955
Let them tell that
to the soldiers who today...

1851
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:01,669
are fighting hard
in the far waters of the Pacific.

1852
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,753
Let them tell that
to the boys in the Flying Fortresses.

1853
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,559
Let them tell that
to the marines.

1854
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,232
That's japan right there, fellas.
Tighten up back there. Man your guns!

1855
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:18,553
We're in the enemy's backyard.

1856
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:21,313
All right,
look alive back there. I see coastline.

1857
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:29,672
Heads up, boys! Heads up!

1858
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:38,071
- Man your guns back there.
- I'm cocked and locked!

1859
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,513
Get ready, you suckers.

1860
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:52,274
Approaching targets for bombing raid.
Open bomb bay doors.
Open bomb bay doors.

1861
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:55,193
Ripley, you got
our target in sight?

1862
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,998
37 degrees. Target in sight.

1863
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:07,950
All right, boys,
let's knock their clocks off!

1864
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:09,996
- Drop your ordnance.
- Bombs away.

1865
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,877
One away!

1866
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:14,030
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!

1867
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:15,712
Two away!

1868
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:25,878
Three away! Four away!

1869
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:33,073
- We caught 'em by surprise.
- Dropping ordnance.

1870
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:34,878
Bombs away! Bombs away!

1871
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:37,076
Factories.Just factories.

1872
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:43,998
- We got it!
- We got it!

1873
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:46,036
We hit our targets.
Good job, Raiders.

1874
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:05,152
We got flak everywhere.

1875
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:10,431
- Go down there and get Gooz!
- I want everyone to separate!

1876
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:12,511
- Clean that up.
- Yes, sir.

1877
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:14,750
- Try and clean that up.
- They're shooting flak at us!

1878
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:29,359
We gotta try
and get out of this shit, Gooz.

1879
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:34,671
We got a fire!
We got a fire!

1880
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:37,718
It's an electric fi--
We got a fire back here!

1881
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:39,791
I'm gonna short this out!

1882
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:42,394
Get into the clouds, Danny,
right now! Get up--

1883
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:57,308
Goddam it!

1884
02:32:58,600 --> 02:32:59,874
Red, go check it out.

1885
02:33:05,560 --> 02:33:08,313
- I'm getting peppered up here!
- just hope they don't hit a prop.

1886
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:15,795
- I'm hit!
- They're gonna tear this plane apart.

1887
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:19,357
We gotta take it up. 800 feet.

1888
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,229
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up! Theo!

1889
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:31,593
Get into the clouds, Danny,
right now. Get up in that soup!

1890
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,716
All right, we're gonna pull out
of this, Gooz. Come on.

1891
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:48,470
Thankyou, George.

1892
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:53,719
What is it, General?

1893
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:58,316
Colonel Doolittle had
to advance his execution order
by 12 hours, Mr President.

1894
02:33:58,400 --> 02:33:59,913
There'll be no homing beacons.

1895
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,560
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China.

1896
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:05,837
And our bombers may lack the fuel
to reach the mainland anyway, sir.

1897
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:10,675
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.

1898
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:15,469
God help them.

1899
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:25,472
Still not getting a signal.

1900
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:29,439
All ocean, no land.
Homing into nothing.

1901
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:33,715
How many cans of fuel
we got left?

1902
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:36,360
These are all empty!

1903
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:39,955
- Is this all you got?
- That's all we got, Red.

1904
02:34:40,040 --> 02:34:43,953
Rafe, you better pray for land.

1905
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:49,079
Break radio silence.

1906
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,519
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1907
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:55,352
You're all brave souls...

1908
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:58,477
among the bravest I've ever had
the privilege of flying with.

1909
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:02,358
But we're on our own.

1910
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:08,872
This really was
a suicide mission.

1911
02:35:23,240 --> 02:35:26,949
- Engine one's fluctuating.
- We're gonna lose it any minute.

1912
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:30,714
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I'm priming it. How about now?

1913
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:37,394
I see the coastline.
I see the coast!

1914
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:39,993
Copy that, Rafe.

1915
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:41,672
- We're gonna make it.
- Yeah.

1916
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:43,557
Danny, follow me now.
We can make this.

1917
02:35:43,640 --> 02:35:46,234
I can see the coast right now.
It's only a few miles out. Follow me.

1918
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:48,880
We're following you, Rafe.
We gotta find a soft landing spot.

1919
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,552
I'm pushing up on two.

1920
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:52,756
Fellas, it's gonna be
a hard landing. Hold on.

1921
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:55,752
I see rice paddies right there.
We'll bring it in right here.

1922
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,992
Oh, God. Engine one's dead.

1923
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,275
We're gonna lose
engine two any second.

1924
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:08,598
We can make it in.
Easy. Pull it back.

1925
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:10,796
We'll glide in,
go in on fumes.

1926
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:16,351
Japs! We got jap patrols
all over the place!

1927
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:18,908
There's Japs everywhere!
Danny, land somewhere else!

1928
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,275
Strap yourself in, boys!
We're coming in hard!

1929
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:24,397
- We're a dead stick.
- Get out of the nose!

1930
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:28,871
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!

1931
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:31,234
Watch the trees!

1932
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,355
Oh, God!

1933
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:55,872
Everyone all right?

1934
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:00,198
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1935
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,635
Where's Ripley?

1936
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,995
He's dead.

1937
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:06,832
Watch for japs.

1938
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:17,755
Jap patrols! Take cover!

1939
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:36,431
- Who's got extra magazines?
- I got 'em.

1940
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:39,512
We got to get up into those hills
and find the Chinese.

1941
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:45,712
They got us pinned down!

1942
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:57,513
- Danny!
- Rafe!

1943
02:37:57,600 --> 02:37:59,272
- Rafe, no! Rafe!
- Danny!

1944
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:03,358
You don't have a chance!
Rafe!

1945
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:07,675
Oh, God. Dan-- Danny!

1946
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:09,671
Come on!

1947
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:15,829
- Gooz? You okay, man?
- Danny!

1948
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:18,115
Oh, shit. Anthony.

1949
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:19,758
Gooz!

1950
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:22,798
- Can you hear me? Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1951
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:28,158
- Danny. Easy, easy, easy.
- I've had better landings.

1952
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:31,152
- You saved us back there.
- I got something in my neck.

1953
02:38:31,240 --> 02:38:33,196
- Let me try to pull this out for you.
- Where's Gooz?

1954
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,113
He's fine.
He's right over there.

1955
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:53,555
Rafe!

1956
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:52,156
Grenade!

1957
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:03,358
Danny.

1958
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:05,112
Danny!

1959
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,350
Danny. Oh!

1960
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:12,196
- Hold on. just hold on one second.
- Rafe.

1961
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:16,319
Hold on now. I got you.
You're all right.
You're all right. There you go.

1962
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:18,755
I'm not--
I'm not gonna make it.

1963
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:25,518
Oh, yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Danny, look at me.

1964
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,079
Rafe.

1965
02:40:27,160 --> 02:40:29,958
I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

1966
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:32,951
You're all right. Hey.

1967
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:39,635
Hey, Rafe?

1968
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:42,473
- Can you do me a favour?
- What?

1969
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:47,111
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?

1970
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,919
You're not gonna die. Look at me.
Listen to me. You ain't gonna die.

1971
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,072
You hear me? Danny.

1972
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:55,515
Danny, you can't die.
You can't die.

1973
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:58,160
You know why? 'Cause
you're gonna be a father, Danny.

1974
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:02,472
You're gonna be a daddy.
I was-- I wasn't supposed to tell you.

1975
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:06,471
You're gonna be a father.

1976
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,233
Please.

1977
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,759
No, you are.

1978
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:26,559
Danny.

1979
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:30,996
Danny?

1980
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:32,559
Danny?

1981
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:36,030
Please. Please. Please.

1982
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:41,435
God.

1983
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:44,034
Please, Danny.

1984
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:56,512
Hold your fire. They're Chinese.

1985
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:17,436
When the action is over
and we look back...

1986
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:20,159
we understand both more and less.

1987
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:22,515
This much is certain.

1988
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:26,513
Before the Doolittle raid,
America knew nothing but defeat.

1989
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:29,990
After it,
there was hope of victory.

1990
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:34,278
Japan realized, for the first time, that
they could lose and began to pull back.

1991
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:38,035
America realized that she would win
and surged forward.

1992
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:42,636
It was a war that changed
America and the world.

1993
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:46,599
Dorie Miller was the first black
American to be awarded the Navy Cross.

1994
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:50,832
But he would not be the last.
He joined a brotherhood of heroes.

1995
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:00,319
That's for all the Raiders.

1996
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:12,634
World War II, for us,
began at Pearl Harbor...

1997
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:17,430
and 1,177 men still lie entombed
in the battleship Arizona.

1998
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:23,077
America suffered,
but America grew stronger.

1999
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:25,151
It was not inevitable.

2000
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:27,959
The times tried our souls...

2001
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:31,350
and through the trial,
we overcame.

2002
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:54,071
Hey, Danny.
How'd you like to go flying?

2003
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:57,631
Come here.

2005
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:04,636
When I think back on these times

2006
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:08,269
And the dreams we left behind

2007
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:12,114
I'll be glad
'cause I was blessed to get

2008
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:15,431
To have you in my life

2009
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:18,478
When I look back on these days

2010
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:22,792
I'll look and see your face

2011
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:27,431
You were right there for me

2012
02:46:30,080 --> 02:46:32,799
In my dreams, I'll always see you

2013
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:37,032
Soar above the sky

2014
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:41,432
In my heart, there will always
be a place for you

2015
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:44,273
For all my life

2016
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:50,196
I'll keep a part of you with me

2017
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:52,999
And everywhere I am

2018
02:46:53,080 --> 02:46:57,278
There you'll be

2019
02:46:57,360 --> 02:47:00,158
And everywhere I am

2020
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:03,994
There you'll be

2021
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:09,391
Well, you showed me how it feels

2022
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:13,519
To feel the sky within my reach

2023
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:16,433
And I always will remember

2024
02:47:16,520 --> 02:47:20,559
All the strength you gave to me

2025
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:23,393
Your love made me make it through

2026
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:28,031
Oh, I owe so much to you

2027
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:32,113
You were right there for me

2028
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:37,999
In my dreams, I'll always see you

2029
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:42,119
Soar above the sky

2030
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:44,839
In my heart, there will always be

2031
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:46,478
A place for you

2032
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:49,472
For all my life

2033
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:55,476
I'll keep a part of you with me

02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:58,154

There you'll be

2036
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:03,750
'Cause I always saw in you my light

2037
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:07,196
My strength

2038
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:13,628
And I wanna thank you now
for all the ways

2039
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:17,235
- You were right there for me
- You were right there for me

2040
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:20,551
You were right there for me

2041
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:25,509
For always

2042
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:28,114
