1
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,177
To me, he seems to be
on a mission.

2
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,881
Only he's fully aware
of what it is.

3
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,520
He's really persistent,

4
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,187
and tries lots
and lots of things.

5
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,524
And he's extremely charming.

6
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,195
We do have a problem here.

7
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,565
It's a safety issue.

8
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,705
He just wasn't just a whale.

9
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,576
He was brought here
for some reason.

10
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,253
That was my greatest honour,

11
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,288
was being able to be his friend.

12
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,087
Must have been

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,691
like a child
getting lost in a supermarket.

14
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,859
He was just
wandering up an aisle,

15
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,294
turned around...

16
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,030
And his family was gone.

17
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,972
Then, he went looking for them.

18
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,174
Nobody was there.

19
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,059
This little whale
is special to me.

20
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,062
He and I came
from the same place.

21
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,764
I grew up in Canada,

22
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,899
on the west coast
of British Columbia,

23
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,102
and he was born in the sea
near my home.

24
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,108
Where I grew up,
everyone loves these orcas.

25
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,311
Scientists know each one
by markings.

26
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,148
So, when
the little whale was born,

27
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,619
he was given a number, I-98,
and a nickname, "Luna."

28
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,057
My family's like most people.

29
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,392
We all scattered
as the kids grew up,

30
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,995
but it's not like that
with orcas.

31
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,031
These big families
stay together for life...

32
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,935
Hunting, playing
and whistling through the sea.

33
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,336
Aunts and uncles,

34
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,872
brothers, sisters,

35
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,074
grandmothers,
daughters, grandsons.

36
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:29,744
Personally, this would drive me
to the brink of insanity...

37
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:33,047
But, with orcas,
it's perfectly natural.

38
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,221
In these close families,
nobody just gets lost...

39
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,190
But, somehow, Luna did.

40
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,096
In the winter,
these whales travel far.

41
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,931
People don't see them much,

42
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,766
so no one really knows
how it happened.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,702
But, one day,

44
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,737
in a fjord called Nootka sound,

45
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,672
on the west coast
of Vancouver island,

46
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,441
about 200 nautical miles
from his family's summer home,

47
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,211
Luna found himself alone.

48
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,847
He was less than two years old.

49
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,028
Much later,

50
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,697
when scientists came to listen
with hydrophones,

51
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,833
they found out,
that, in his solitude,

52
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,968
Luna called out every day...

53
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,938
But only
the deep rocks answered.

54
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,789
One day, not long ago,

55
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,925
journalist Mike Parfit
and his wife, Suzanne Chisholm,

56
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,861
returned
to the town of gold river,

57
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,162
on Nootka sound.

58
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,964
It was the last of many journeys

59
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:57,131
in the making of this film.

60
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,334
Years before,

61
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:03,204
they'd come just to write
a short magazine article.

62
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,807
Now they were coming back
to old friends

63
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,041
and familiar places,

64
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:08,509
and the story of a lost whale

65
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,542
who changed their lives.

66
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,216
When they first came here,
years ago,

67
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,919
they hadn't planned
to make a film.

68
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,453
They certainly didn't plan

69
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,356
to get involved in the story
themselves,

70
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,192
and they didn't plan
to break any rules...

71
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,394
But all those things happened,

72
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,963
and a lot more
that nobody expected...

73
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,469
and Suzanne and Mike and I
are here to tell you why.

74
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,345
This is
a place called Mooyah Bay.

75
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,247
There's a logging camp
back there,

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,350
and a kind of a wide spot
in Nootka sound up here.

77
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,253
And this is where
Luna showed up,

78
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,555
out in this part
of Nootka sound.

79
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,891
And it all started right here,

80
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,260
just like an old-fashioned
adventure story.

81
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:03,297
You know...
the sea, a ship, a journey.

82
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,084
The old freighter
called the Uchuck III

83
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,253
travels up and down Nootka sound
almost every day,

84
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,955
bringing supplies
to the logging camps

85
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,423
and the fishing resorts
scattered along the shores.

86
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,171
One July day,

87
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,506
Donna Schneider,
the ship's cook,

88
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,941
looked out the galley door,

89
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,978
and saw something
she'd remember forever.

90
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:51,345
Yeah.

91
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,190
We saw him right in this area
here, Mooyah Bay.

92
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,316
Quite often,
I look at where we've been,

93
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,584
I looked back,

94
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,953
and I could see
this whale in our wake...

95
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,065
So I ran up to Sean and he said,
"I was looking at that,"

96
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,424
and he goes,
"I think it's a pilot whale."

97
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:07,395
And then we came back,
and then we saw it,

98
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,997
I said, "Sean,
that's not a pilot whale,

99
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,031
that's an orca."

100
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,168
So we just sort of sailed on by.

101
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:15,636
And you see him,
and then you think,

102
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,471
"oh, well, we won't
see him again."

103
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,040
Kept showing up,
kept showing up.

104
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,441
Then, when we kept seeing him,

105
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,211
we sort of went,
"there's something weird here."

106
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,383
Many people hope

107
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,419
that some day we'll meet
an intelligent being

108
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,621
from another world.

109
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,258
Hollywood tells US this stranger

110
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,928
will come flying down
in a spaceship,

111
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,396
and he'll look a bit like US.

112
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,400
Most importantly,
he'll have a mind like ours...

113
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,938
And we'll figure out
how to communicate right away.

114
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,150
But maybe it won't be like that.

115
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,959
Maybe it'll be like this.

116
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:51,266
A few months
after Luna was first seen,

117
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,434
he started to pop up

118
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,336
at boats and docks
in Mooyah Bay,

119
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,704
as if to say "hello."

120
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:58,373
How are you?
Haven't seen you for a while.

121
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:02,111
That whale needs, and wants,
and craves attention.

122
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:03,478
It was incredibly surreal,

123
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:05,314
and I remember being amazed

124
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,749
that he wanted to see US
as much as we wanted to see him.

125
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,284
People here responded

126
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:12,354
with a funny combination
of awe and disbelief

127
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,123
and compassion.

128
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:17,092
I think when they saw
this little whale all alone,

129
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,461
they recognized
that he needed something.

130
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:22,697
We were coming back
on a sunday afternoon.

131
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,034
It was in Mooyah Bay,

132
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,668
and he just came
right up to the boat.

133
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,070
He was under the boat.

134
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:30,672
He just looked so lonely.

135
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:32,307
It was just like
a little lost pup.

136
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:34,609
It just broke your heart,
though, to leave him,

137
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:35,786
because you know he's all alone

138
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,313
and he just wants
that interaction.

139
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,049
Right off the bat, you're going,

140
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:42,127
"oh, man, this thing isn't like
a reptile or something,

141
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:43,785
it's got emotions."

142
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,496
I mean, that big guy would look
and bring his eye right there,

143
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,189
and he's looking at you.

144
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:50,359
It wasn't like a dog
sniffing your leg or something.

145
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:51,760
He was communicating.

146
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,695
He would come up
and roll on his side,

147
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:55,430
and look right at you.

148
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:56,674
You know, that's not
a predator or something,

149
00:09:56,698 --> 00:10:00,102
that's somebody
just wanting to bond.

150
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,603
If you look in his eye,
you know,

151
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,805
there's more there
than most of my guests.

152
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,310
Orcas live
about as long as humans,

153
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:10,312
and Luna was only two.

154
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,714
Scientists weren't sure
he could survive on his own.

155
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:18,420
Such a young
killer whale, all by itself,

156
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,489
ran counter to everything
we thought we knew

157
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:21,523
about killer whales.

158
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:22,791
We thought that it would be

159
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:24,826
like laying a baby
in the forest.

160
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:28,163
He's "mowgli the jungle boy"
of whales.

161
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:32,334
There are times in your life

162
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,636
when you reach a point
and you say,

163
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,572
"this will be with me
till the day I die."

164
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:40,575
Fisheries officer
ed thorburn was told

165
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,444
to keep an eye
on the little whale.

166
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:43,588
He's definitely
pushing it towards US,

167
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:44,646
that's for sure.

168
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,448
Trying to get US wet, are ya?

169
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:47,682
It turned out

170
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,484
that Luna was getting
plenty of fish.

171
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,620
He didn't seem hungry at all,

172
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,522
but he kept coming up
to Ed's boat,

173
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,690
doing things like this...

174
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:01,696
Well, well, what a sight.

175
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,106
So, he had
this little piece of wood,

176
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,408
so he came and he balanced it
on his nose,

177
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:16,278
and then he's just flipping it
back past his blowhole...

178
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:21,316
I was thinking
he was entertaining himself,

179
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,851
and I didn't realize

180
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:26,755
it was probably something to do
with socializing as well.

181
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:29,158
If he wasn't hungry,

182
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,326
maybe he was just...

183
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,794
Lonely.

184
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:34,429
Killer whales have social needs

185
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,265
that are as strong
as those of humans,

186
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:37,632
perhaps more so.

187
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,909
In fact, I think
I'd stick my neck out and say

188
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,736
they really are
stronger than humans.

189
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,872
I'm sure you could
damage a whale psychologically

190
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:46,708
by, you know,
by depriving it of contact.

191
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,144
But Lance was talking about

192
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:50,845
contact with other whales.

193
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,382
This little guy
didn't have any whales.

194
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:54,749
So, he apparently decided

195
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,885
that if you can't be
with the species you are,

196
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:59,621
make friends
with the species you're with.

197
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:21,576
I'd say, personality-wise,
he sort of knew what he wanted.

198
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,214
I'd say he was somehow spunky,
he was lively, he was engaging,

199
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:26,581
he was kind of pushy.

200
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,450
I would say he was sort of

201
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,485
an "outside the envelope"
kind of whale.

202
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:38,927
I touched him!

203
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,363
Now I touched him that much!

204
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,698
You know, you just...

205
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:48,503
How can you not touch the whale
when he comes over there?

206
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:51,840
My granddaughter,
my littlest granddaughter...

207
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,743
"I'm the queen
of the whale-touchers."

208
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:02,484
You know,
it was a beautiful feeling,

209
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,754
communicating with
that animal like that.

210
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,523
Did he scare you?

211
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:12,661
Don't you bite me...

212
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,598
Don't you bite me!

213
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,902
Oh, yeah.

214
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:34,583
Now I... now I touched him
this many times!

215
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,802
Whoops!

216
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:53,869
He was very gentle.

217
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,538
Like, he would...

218
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:57,873
you'd be petting him, like,
on his nose and stuff,

219
00:13:57,907 --> 00:14:01,644
and he would just start
to open his mouth,

220
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:05,281
and then I would just slowly
put my hand in,

221
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,317
and he would open his mouth
right up.

222
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,585
His tongue is very raspy.

223
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:17,960
My heart just goes like this
when I get close to him.

224
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,536
Are you recording this?

225
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,574
Okay, what was that, Fred?

226
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,744
You always wish

227
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:37,680
that you could communicate
with wild animals like that,

228
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,949
and when a wild animal
actually comes

229
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,685
and makes contact with you,

230
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:46,422
it's an amazing thing.

231
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:53,329
The first thing
that comes into my mind

232
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:54,797
when I see all of this

233
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,668
is that, of course,
Luna was looking for friends...

234
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,971
But, friendship,
that's a human idea.

235
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:06,108
Scientists call it
"anthropomorphism"

236
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:08,444
when we use human ideas,
like friendship,

237
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:12,047
to describe animals' feelings...

238
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,651
And, for years,
they've said that was wrong.

239
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,353
That's one of those words

240
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:19,522
that the anthropomorphic police
would not let you use

241
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:20,756
for a long time,

242
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,458
was sort of "friendships"
and animals.

243
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:24,894
But as scientists
have learned more

244
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,097
about the way humans and animals
experience similar emotions,

245
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,801
some now use words like
"friendship" themselves.

246
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,936
Whales
have developed friendships,

247
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:38,007
and understanding how friends
interact with each other

248
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,509
is great stuff.

249
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,044
But how should humans interact

250
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:43,779
with a friendly whale?

251
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:45,047
Nobody knew.

252
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,517
But a lot of people
wanted to find out.

253
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,520
When news of the whale
started to travel,

254
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:53,389
people,
they just got really excited.

255
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,391
You know, they'd know
we'd seen him,

256
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:56,468
so they'd say,
"did you see the whale?

257
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,060
Did you see the whale?"

258
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,962
"Well, yeah, I saw him!"
I'd be really excited.

259
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:03,999
You know, everywhere you went,
people were talking about Luna.

260
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:08,103
Like many residents
around Nootka sound,

261
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,540
Luna went to work
in the timber industry.

262
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,682
Some of the crews said

263
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:20,959
they ought to get him goggles
and a hard hat,

264
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,419
put him on the payroll.

265
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:26,522
Ed thorburn
started calling him "Bruno."

266
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:28,658
I thought, "boy, Luna...

267
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:30,125
That's a girl's name."

268
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,870
So I thought, well,
here he is, playing with logs,

269
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:33,796
I mean, he's pushing
40-footers around,

270
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,898
but I just referred to him
as Bruno,

271
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,734
because it was more appropriate
to what he was doing,

272
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:42,037
and he was a boy,
and I thought, you know?

273
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:45,575
Ed got so interested
that he did some research,

274
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:48,711
particularly about whether
this baby whale was dangerous.

275
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,613
I mean,
there have been incidents

276
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:53,115
where killer whales have been
responsible for deaths,

277
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:54,717
you know, like, in aquariums,

278
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,853
but there is no history
of a killer whale

279
00:16:57,887 --> 00:17:01,857
ever having
a nasty experience purposely

280
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:03,759
with a human in the wild.

281
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:08,698
He likes US, it seems,
so we like him.

282
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:11,901
But you could never tell that
with a cougar or a grizzly bear,

283
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,604
whether they like you
or they want to eat you.

284
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,105
You know

285
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,912
how often in our lives
do we have a chance

286
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:25,715
to be this close
to something this phenomenal,

287
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:28,217
and share some space
and some time and some moments?

288
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,121
We humans build
a wall in our minds,

289
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,889
out of fear and respect

290
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:37,192
between ourselves
and wild beings.

291
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:39,929
Luna was breaking it down.

292
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:43,566
When he pops up,
and he looks at you,

293
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,267
you can see, I mean...

294
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,770
The eyes are
the window to the soul.

295
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:49,639
Words escape me sometimes,

296
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:50,849
because you'd just look at him,

297
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:52,675
and he would look at you
in the eye,

298
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,244
and you would be mesmerized
or something.

299
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:57,117
Looked like he was just
looking right into you.

300
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:59,114
You know, the way
that he regarded you

301
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,651
in a fairly studied kind of way,

302
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:05,888
and, uh, in a sort of
contemplative way,

303
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:10,225
you had the feeling
that he knew what he was doing.

304
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,761
You know, killer whales,

305
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,271
they come in all the time,
they'll come up,

306
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,565
and they'll try to steer away
from you all the time,

307
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:16,999
and stuff like that.

308
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,952
But for a killer whale
to be interested in you...

309
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:24,273
He just had a way of
getting inside of me,

310
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:27,209
inside of my head,
and into my heart.

311
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:31,747
It seems like my spirit,
or my soul,

312
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:34,917
like, my thegmasti was dancing.

313
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:47,663
When Suzanne and I
first got to Nootka sound,

314
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:48,764
and started...

315
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:50,966
Watching Luna from the shore,

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,769
we had that same feeling
of kinship,

317
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,571
even from that distance.

318
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,106
But... why?

319
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:01,912
How could an animal
so different,

320
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,347
that you could almost call him
an extra-terrestrial,

321
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,350
have anything in common
with human beings?

322
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,353
But maybe he did.

323
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:13,023
Once, we humans thought

324
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:16,259
animals were here
just to serve US.

325
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,129
Once, philosophers said
they had no thoughts.

326
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:22,265
But, today, while
radio astronomers listen

327
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:24,067
for other voices in space,

328
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,204
biologists are listening
to other minds here at home.

329
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,843
Right here, on earth,

330
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,912
there is now evidence that
lives we once barely noticed

331
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:38,381
are both more mysterious
and more familiar

332
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:40,851
than we had ever imagined.

333
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:56,332
Whales have been in the sea
for 50 million years,

334
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:59,803
humans have been on land
for as long as we know,

335
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:02,706
but both of US built
our survival

336
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:06,309
by learning to depend
on family and friends.

337
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:08,411
So, in our separate ways,

338
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:12,683
both humans and orcas
have learned the same thing...

339
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:15,218
in solitude, we are incomplete.

340
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:18,088
We cannot bear it.

341
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:22,225
Many scientists think

342
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,427
that this kind of
complex social life

343
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,831
requires the most intricate
intelligence of all...

344
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:30,433
You have to be smart
to get along.

345
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,372
So maybe that's why

346
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:39,142
this seemed so strange
and wonderful.

347
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:42,378
Maybe when we humans
looked in Luna's eyes,

348
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:44,748
we saw something we recognized...

349
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:46,750
the intent,

350
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,752
the awareness,

351
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:51,988
and the longing
of a fully-conscious life.

352
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,968
We're living in historic times.

353
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,369
It's just so powerful,

354
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:09,840
that it's really
a hard thing to explain.

355
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:12,308
The intensity of this contact

356
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:15,678
meant different things
to different people.

357
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,215
At the mouth of Nootka sound,

358
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,484
there's a point of land
and a little cove.

359
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:24,420
There's a lighthouse here,
and an old church.

360
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:27,123
The people
who now call themselves

361
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:29,760
the mowachaht/muchalaht
first nations

362
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:33,196
have lived here
for over 4,000 years.

363
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,807
For the mowachaht/muchalaht
people,

364
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,209
tradition explained
what was going on.

365
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:48,178
So there are
supernatural creatures

366
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:50,280
in our belief system.

367
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,917
"Quiet-siek" is the wolf.

368
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,522
He's one of our most respected
creatures on the land.

369
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:05,095
His counterpart in the ocean
is the, uh, orca.

370
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:09,232
He's connected
with truth and justice.

371
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:14,437
The band's
old chief, ambrose Maquinna,

372
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,207
died the week Luna showed up.

373
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,942
He had told his friend
Jerry Jack

374
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:21,477
that he'd come back as an orca.

375
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:26,049
"I'm 74," he said,
"I'm getting closer to heaven."

376
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:27,517
He was really happy.

377
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,519
"When I go home," he said,

378
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:32,422
"I am going to come back
as a kaka'win."

379
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:34,825
Man, it happened!

380
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:36,893
It happened.

381
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:42,298
The first nations
started calling Luna

382
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:44,801
"tsu'xiit", ambrose's nickname.

383
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,903
To them,
he didn't just raise questions,

384
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:49,472
he promised answers.

385
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,910
To me,
he seems to be on a mission.

386
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:56,446
Only he's fully aware
of what it is.

387
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:59,315
He just wasn't just a whale.

388
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:03,019
He was brought here
for some reason.

389
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:09,860
Tsu-xiit is the wolf of the sea,

390
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:12,495
and we hold him
in the highest regard.

391
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:16,432
Like, I'd put my life
on the line for his protection.

392
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,168
It's just no questions asked.

393
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,570
I'd do it.

394
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,179
That summer,
Luna turned three years old.

395
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:31,915
Now there was
another intense reaction

396
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:33,850
to all this contact.

397
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:36,019
Some people
thought it was wrong.

398
00:23:36,052 --> 00:23:39,355
When I heard
that Luna was alone,

399
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:42,592
it was kind of like...

400
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,061
My heart, you know,
my heart clunked.

401
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:47,363
Well, you know,
he might come up and bump...

402
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:50,100
Toni frohoff is a biologist.

403
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,535
Sometimes,
in other parts of the world,

404
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:54,004
solitary whales or dolphins

405
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:56,072
try to make contact
with human beings.

406
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:58,608
Toni studies those rare events.

407
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,243
You see in the media

408
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:03,980
a lot of the really beautiful
aspects.

409
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:06,082
That's the light side of it,

410
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,084
but there's
a very, very dark side.

411
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:13,189
The dark side is the human side.

412
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:17,561
There is always
risk of injury to the people.

413
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:24,235
There is always risk of injury
to the whale.

414
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:27,604
One of the whales
Cathy Kinsman tried to protect

415
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:30,207
was a little beluga
named "echo."

416
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:35,512
Echo played with people
in newfoundland.

417
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:39,516
But, one day, he came back
to the dock

418
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,585
with this...

419
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:49,393
This was one of only a few times

420
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:51,395
Cathy herself
interacted with a whale.

421
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:53,230
A veterinarian told her

422
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:56,633
that attention might help
support echo's immune system,

423
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,003
so Cathy spent
all her daylight hours

424
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:01,172
by echo's side for two weeks,

425
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,974
as he tried to heal.

426
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,682
Echo survived...

427
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:15,052
But this kind of pain
is tragically common.

428
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:17,021
In the long term,

429
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:18,722
our research has shown,

430
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:22,326
the more interaction
dolphins and whales have

431
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,961
with people,

432
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:28,032
the more likely they are
to suffer injury and death.

433
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,267
So, it became this huge dilemma

434
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:32,269
on Nootka sound,
for people who cared about Luna.

435
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,471
Your natural instinct

436
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:37,374
was to give Luna that attention
that he was looking for,

437
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:38,751
but what it if was dangerous
for him?

438
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,711
What were you supposed to do?

439
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:42,346
At the west coast office

440
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,415
of the Canadian department
of fisheries and oceans,

441
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,117
there was a firm answer...

442
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,053
stay away from him.

443
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:50,630
I think that's my underlying
philosophy,

444
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:53,257
that I try to get
the message out every day,

445
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,259
when it comes
to the marine mammals.

446
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,528
I really want nature
to go about its business

447
00:25:57,561 --> 00:26:00,097
with the least interference
from US, really.

448
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:02,633
You're being a friend
by staying away.

449
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:06,470
I felt
that he was desperately lonely

450
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:09,173
and needed this contact,

451
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:10,374
but everything I was told

452
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,009
was that it was
a bad thing to do,

453
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:13,377
so that's where I stood.

454
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,146
So, that summer,

455
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,613
a group of organizations joined

456
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:19,050
to bring a kind of tough love
to Nootka sound,

457
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,585
to rebuild the wall between US
and wild beings

458
00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:23,254
that Luna was breaking.

459
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:26,257
It was called "stewardship."

460
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,159
Hey, guys?

461
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:29,669
It's an offence,
under the fisheries act,

462
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:31,162
to touch this whale.

463
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,098
Yeah, but you stopped,

464
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:35,608
and you actually came right out
in the middle of the area.

465
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:38,102
There's been a lot of
public attention on this whale.

466
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:40,304
It's up to a $100,000 fine,
under the fisheries act,

467
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,606
to disturb the animal.

468
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,808
The young women

469
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:48,212
were idealistic, sincere
and determined.

470
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,714
Please don't touch it!

471
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,183
Okay...

472
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,784
When I was 21,

473
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:56,520
I would have given anything
to have a summer job like this.

474
00:26:56,553 --> 00:26:58,255
Babysitting a whale?

475
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,790
Awesome.

476
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:02,093
But this wasn't fun.

477
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:03,594
They had to be the bad guys

478
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:06,530
and tell people to stop
doing something incredible...

479
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:09,433
And Luna was absolutely
no help at all.

480
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:13,170
Folks!
This is not a watchable whale.

481
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:16,273
Okay? I need you
to exit the area.

482
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,409
Watching this whale,
or interacting with this whale,

483
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,577
can be subject
to a $100,000 fine

484
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:21,778
under the fisheries act.

485
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:23,247
This whale is not watchable.

486
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,216
Just do not stop in this area
altogether.

487
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,517
Okay.

488
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,119
Watching can be considered
"disturbance"

489
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:29,453
under the fisheries act.

490
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:31,255
Gradually increase speed.

491
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:32,732
- Get out of here, high speed.
- Try and keep your speed up.

492
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,391
-High speed out of here.

493
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:35,635
- Increase your speed, thank you!
- Keep your speed up.

494
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:37,461
- Increase your speed!
- Don't slow down!

495
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:38,629
Faster!

496
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,831
Just increase your speed slowly!

497
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:43,234
In the beginning,
people were very receptive.

498
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:45,469
They were very, "oh, okay,
thank you very much.

499
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,138
We're out of here."

500
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:48,648
Michelle kehler
was one of the stewards.

501
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:50,174
And then it was amazing,

502
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,784
the amount of boats
that had engine troubles

503
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:52,843
right in Mooyah Bay.

504
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,645
It was just amazing.

505
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:02,586
We stopped and he
came roaring right up.

506
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,388
Keith bell of gold river

507
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:07,491
didn't much like
being told what to do.

508
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:09,193
There was two girls
on the zodiac.

509
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:10,427
One was taking video,

510
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:12,263
and the other one
was asking questions,

511
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:13,530
and I thought

512
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:14,907
I was being checked out
by the fisheries.

513
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:16,467
And they're thinking,

514
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,269
"where did d.F.O.
Even find you two

515
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,879
so it was difficult
to be taken seriously.

516
00:28:19,903 --> 00:28:21,572
Sometimes, Luna made it hard

517
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:24,275
for anyone
to take anything very seriously.

518
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:28,912
So, touching him

519
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:31,715
is 100,000 bucks a pop
right now.

520
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:32,916
What?

521
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:34,518
And we're out here
to make that happen.

522
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:36,387
Luna... You're not helping.

523
00:28:37,854 --> 00:28:40,891
Why doesn't somebody
just grab him and move him?

524
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:42,559
Because...

525
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:47,564
Don't push, Luna.

526
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,534
Unreal.

527
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:51,802
Ow.

528
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:54,471
Want to turn off
your engine for a moment,

529
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:56,707
and I'll see if he'll follow me?

530
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,276
The stewards
developed a technique

531
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,178
for trying to
stop Luna's interactions.

532
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:03,447
They called it "ditching him."

533
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,283
It felt really bad, actually,
because we would, um,

534
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:07,460
basically, we were tricking him.

535
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:08,952
Stay! Okay, take off.

536
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:12,523
If he was alongside of a boat
and pushing them around,

537
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:14,558
and they couldn't get away,
if we came alongside,

538
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:15,959
Luna would come
alongside our boat,

539
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,437
we would put the Fender out
or something,

540
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:19,196
entice him to come over.

541
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,707
We would sort of say, "hey,
come on, we'll play with you,

542
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:22,433
we'll do it,"

543
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:23,676
as soon as the other boat
was far enough in the distance,

544
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,702
then we would ditch him.

545
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:27,972
So the contact wasn't stopped.

546
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:29,707
It was just made inconsistent.

547
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:31,943
That must have been
pretty hard on Luna as well.

548
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:33,745
One day,
have all these people around,

549
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:34,879
and everything was great,

550
00:29:34,912 --> 00:29:36,248
and the next day, nothing,

551
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,582
because we'd show up.

552
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:38,983
It would just
rip your heart out!

553
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:40,885
I don't want to be
making your life miserable,

554
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,421
but I know this isn't
good for you...

555
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:46,924
Or at least I think it's not,
because what do we know?

556
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,327
I don't know that we know that.

557
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,329
Maybe he'll just
keep following the tug.

558
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:52,597
I don't know.

559
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,898
Luna apparently figured out

560
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:55,600
that if the stewards
saw him coming,

561
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:56,868
they'd dash away,

562
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,836
so he developed
a more subtle approach,

563
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,907
which Suzanne later called...
"Stealth whale."

564
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,008
No, Luna.

565
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,378
I don't see him.

566
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,647
Oh,!

567
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:19,624
I mean, he is really persistent,

568
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:21,693
and tries lots
and lots of things,

569
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,261
and he's extremely charming!

570
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:24,596
And you might know
what is right,

571
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,564
what you think is right,

572
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:27,941
and what you think
you're going to do...

573
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:29,401
Here he comes.

574
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,803
He likes my bracelet,
sometimes...

575
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:33,805
And then you get yourself
in that situation

576
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:34,872
with him there,

577
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,274
and I think it's really tough.

578
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:37,775
I think it's asking
people too much,

579
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,477
to restrict themselves,

580
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,622
because people are dying
for that kind of interaction.

581
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:44,849
Oops. I'm not supposed
to touch you, sweetie.

582
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,984
Oh, we were
in a terrible situation!

583
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,653
It was pretty obvious
from the get-go

584
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:50,922
that this was not going to be
a sustainable means

585
00:30:50,955 --> 00:30:53,491
of trying to prevent
types of interactions,

586
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:55,793
because all we were doing
was interacting with him

587
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:58,996
in order to prevent
more interactions.

588
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,666
As the stewards saw more of Luna

589
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,401
in these situations,

590
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,903
they came into conflict
with themselves.

591
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:08,773
They were trying to rebuild
the wall that Luna had broken,

592
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:13,077
but they loved him
when he came through it.

593
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,847
You sure are pretty, Luna.

594
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,882
Yes! You are, very pretty.

595
00:31:17,915 --> 00:31:19,684
And he's playing with our boat!

596
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:22,086
When you feel like
you have that connection,

597
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,356
there's just nothing else
like it.

598
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:25,990
I've never experienced
anything like it.

599
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:27,492
You know, I love my dogs,

600
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:29,093
I love all the animals
I have ever had,

601
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,862
but this was different.

602
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:34,098
This was different.

603
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,836
No one knows
how Luna felt this connection,

604
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,638
but he seemed to feel something,

605
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:41,773
and it was strong.

606
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:43,941
He was all scarred up

607
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:46,344
from props
and other sharp things on boats,

608
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:47,979
but that didn't stop him.

609
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:51,449
And when the Uchuck was told not
to stop to see him anymore,

610
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:53,518
he adapted.

611
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:55,487
That's when he started
travelling with US.

612
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,589
It was like, "well,
you guys aren't going to stop,

613
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,424
I'm gonna come with you."

614
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:02,126
He started to
sort of commute by wake

615
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,028
for 15 nautical miles,

616
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:07,131
back and forth from
his home waters of Mooyah Bay,

617
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:09,401
to a place that was
way more entertaining...

618
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:12,003
The gold river docks.

619
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:24,682
But if it was fun for Luna,

620
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:25,850
it was not fun

621
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:27,985
for fisheries officer
ed thorburn.

622
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:29,621
We had to get it out

623
00:32:29,654 --> 00:32:32,424
that we were serious
about interaction,

624
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:34,692
and we would deal with it.

625
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:36,093
Well, I was just...

626
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:37,729
I was just petting him,

627
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:40,097
like, petting his nose
and stuff.

628
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:41,633
Sandy bohn was showing Luna

629
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,701
to her mother and father
at the dock.

630
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:45,870
We're standing there,
and I knelt down,

631
00:32:45,903 --> 00:32:47,739
and he came right up
to the edge,

632
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:50,442
and turned sideways,
looking at me,

633
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:52,910
and so I just
started petting him,

634
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,513
because I knew
that's what he wanted.

635
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:57,749
Like, he was just
sort of floating there.

636
00:32:57,782 --> 00:32:59,417
And then, when I knelt down,

637
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:02,654
he just sort of rolled over
and had a look at me...

638
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:10,762
And, all of a sudden,
I heard this,

639
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,464
"you, there!

640
00:33:12,497 --> 00:33:16,634
Get your hands off that whale,
and stand up right now."

641
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,703
It was a police officer,

642
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:21,739
coming to take her away.

643
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:26,778
Sandy was charged in court
with "disturbing a whale."

644
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:36,087
Luna was not
called as a witness.

645
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:43,761
After months of worry
about the $100,000 fine,

646
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:46,230
Sandy was slapped
with a $100 fine.

647
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:47,732
Did she regret it?

648
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:48,966
No. Not at all.

649
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,903
It's the best $100 I ever spent.

650
00:33:53,671 --> 00:33:54,772
Luna!

651
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:56,007
Luna was determined,

652
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,643
and the tough love
was inconsistent.

653
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:01,813
He has beautiful eyes!

654
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:04,749
Now some people wanted
to do anything they could

655
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:06,150
to help him get home,

656
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:18,963
So, a noted orca biologist
named Ken balcomb,

657
00:34:18,996 --> 00:34:21,966
who had studied Luna's family
for over 30 years,

658
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,268
offered to lead Luna
back to his pod,

659
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:27,605
with a little less tough,
and a little more love.

660
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,007
It was just
this cosmic coincidence.

661
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,209
We were given
a million-dollar boat,

662
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,211
and the donor felt that,

663
00:34:34,245 --> 00:34:38,082
"well, this would be
a real great way to start..."

664
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,784
You know, the use of the boat.

665
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:42,054
"Go up and save
that little whale.

666
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:44,122
I'll pay for it."

667
00:34:45,323 --> 00:34:48,561
Ken's idea offered
Luna a bit of companionship

668
00:34:48,594 --> 00:34:50,829
and the chance at
getting back with his family,

669
00:34:50,863 --> 00:34:53,265
and it would cost
the government nothing.

670
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:59,572
But, at the department
of fisheries and oceans,

671
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:02,107
Marilyn Joyce's boss
turned down the idea,

672
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,976
because he didn't want

673
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,879
Luna to have
more contact with people.

674
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:12,851
Here it was like everything
was coming into place,

675
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:16,589
and we were given a boat,
a magnificent vessel,

676
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:18,791
and money to do it,

677
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,059
but I was told that, uh...

678
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,995
I would be arrested.

679
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:32,938
Just tell them to dock as usual.

680
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:36,675
Okay. Luna's coming back.

681
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,044
The first minute we got there
was mayhem.

682
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:40,779
It was absolutely insane.

683
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:41,853
Go about their business,

684
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,915
ignore the whale.

685
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,717
Just ignore him.

686
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:53,258
It was summer again.

687
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,060
Luna was four years old.

688
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:56,695
Another batch of young women

689
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:59,364
came north
to administer tough love.

690
00:35:59,397 --> 00:36:01,900
Now it was so tough,

691
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,377
you weren't even
supposed to look at him.

692
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:04,737
We were instructed

693
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,805
not to make any contact
with Luna.

694
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,373
No. Especially eye contact,

695
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:10,843
because it is just as bad
as touching him, really.

696
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,378
He's got something in his mouth.

697
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:16,615
Yeah, he's carrying a stick.

698
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,252
When Mike and Suzanne
got to Nootka sound,

699
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:21,987
Luna found their boat
at the dock.

700
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,857
They were determined to follow
the tough-love rules,

701
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,593
but they saw how hard it was
for both people and Luna.

702
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:32,831
Luna kept finding attention
one day,

703
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:35,100
and then getting ditched
the next,

704
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:38,336
and a lot of people
along Nootka sound were saying

705
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,773
the whole policy was cruel.

706
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:42,174
You can't undo what's done.

707
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:43,676
This is like god's gift,

708
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,343
and you guys
are just blowin' it!

709
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:48,647
This is now a lonely animal
that's looking for comfort.

710
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,249
And who made those rules
in the first place?

711
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:52,918
And who says they were right?

712
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:55,387
We had come down
a couple of times

713
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,790
after I had been fined.

714
00:36:57,823 --> 00:36:59,992
Well, watching him
around the boats,

715
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:03,929
looking for someone
to pay attention to him.

716
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:06,865
It was very upsetting
to see him.

717
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:10,002
And I'm going to start crying.

718
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:25,851
Then, out of boredom,

719
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:27,686
or enthusiasm,

720
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,121
or maybe just chance,

721
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:33,325
Luna started playing
with the float planes.

722
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,130
It's a very bad situation.

723
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:41,038
Why don't you guys get your boat

724
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,701
and lead him out of here,

725
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:44,870
instead of taking pictures?

726
00:37:44,903 --> 00:37:46,338
He's just going to wreck that.

727
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:48,807
That's worth a bundle of money!

728
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:50,909
And that's when
I became more insistent

729
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:52,878
that we had to do something.

730
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:54,479
Because all you needed

731
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:56,849
was something to happen
to one of these planes,

732
00:37:56,882 --> 00:37:59,051
and somebody get hurt seriously
or die,

733
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:02,154
and it would probably
spell the demise of Luna.

734
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:04,890
He said, "do everything
in your power

735
00:38:04,923 --> 00:38:07,059
to get that animal
off the seaplane."

736
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:09,361
He said, "if you have to
touch him, do it."

737
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:13,398
Ed said, "keep him safe,
he won't get shot."

738
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:16,969
Now the stewards had to do

739
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:20,372
exactly what they had been told
would hurt him.

740
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:24,009
They had to look at him,
and they had to play with him.

741
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:31,950
We'd gotten so used to him.

742
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:34,052
But, then,
at that moment in time,

743
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:36,121
I popped out and I went,
"whoa. Wait a minute"

744
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:39,491
and I remember thinking,
"this is so... out there.

745
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:42,828
"How did it happen
that I'm here,

746
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:46,498
nursing a killer whale
with a Fender?"

747
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:50,468
And it's looking up at me,
with direct eye contact,

748
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:53,872
it's just, "whoa."

749
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:01,546
Good timing.

750
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:03,849
Because look
what's coming through here.

751
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:09,254
You just ignore the float plane,
do you understand?

752
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:14,259
You be a good whale,
and ignore that float plane.

753
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:18,563
Good whales don't
play with float planes. No.

754
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:20,966
Good boy. Good job.

755
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,335
I broke down.

756
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:24,569
I had tears.

757
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:25,914
I said, "I'm leaving.
I can't do it.

758
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:27,439
I can't do this.

759
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:29,808
I can't be here,
and be a part of this,

760
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:32,510
and then watch this animal die."

761
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:37,015
Tough love wasn't working.

762
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:38,483
Being friendly was illegal.

763
00:39:38,516 --> 00:39:41,519
So now
there was a different idea.

764
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:53,298
♪ Luna was a lonely whale

765
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:55,068
♪ a lonely little orphan whale

766
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,235
Luna's apparent loneliness

767
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,171
had captured hearts everywhere,

768
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:02,075
from this nearby school
to other nations.

769
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,944
Now, many people demanded
that Luna be caught

770
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:06,012
and carried south,

771
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:07,446
in the hope

772
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,515
that his family would find him
and take him back.

773
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:12,418
News stories about this campaign
were seen in many countries.

774
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,988
Luna seems to be
a perfectly normal, healthy...

775
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,990
Reynolds one of the leaders
of this effort

776
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,524
lived in the Canadian prairies,

777
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:20,426
a long way from the sea.

778
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,028
We have a river

779
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:23,196
running through saskatoon

780
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:24,931
that's about
as wide as a street,

781
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,966
you know, and so we don't
have any whales there.

782
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,935
But he started a website

783
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,904
that quickly registered
over 10,000 people.

784
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:33,272
All over the world,
people from england,

785
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,409
from Japan, Africa,
you know, every continent,

786
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:39,913
people put effort
into reuniting Luna,

787
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:42,415
and that was the moon-shot
for these people.

788
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:45,618
That was them sending
our rocket to the moon.

789
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,954
If we could get Luna
back to his pod,

790
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:52,191
that's what
they set out to accomplish.

791
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:53,559
♪ Won't be coming back

got involved,

794

and the u.S. Offered $100,000

795
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:01,434
to help pay
for a reunion attempt.

796
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,272
At first,
the department said no,

797
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:08,207
and people got angry.

798
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:10,609
Certainly,
there was a tremendous amount

799
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:12,278
of political pressure.

800
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:14,280

803
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,387
apparently, the pressure worked.

804
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,622
Suddenly,
the department changed its mind.

805
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:25,524
"Oh, man!
Luna's going to be reunited.

806
00:41:25,558 --> 00:41:27,226
This is gonna be
the greatest thing ever!"

807
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,563
Luna's days
in Nootka sound are numbered.

808
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:32,365
The department of
fisheries and oceans

809
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:33,632
says the four-year-old orca

810
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,502
is now a danger
to himself and to people.

811
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,204
As I said,

812
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:40,215
we really did hope that
Luna could just go on his way

813
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,441
without US interfering with him.

814
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:44,110
Who knows what
he has on his mind,

815
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:47,013
but, anyway, we're making
decisions for him now.

816
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,325
The decision was made.

817
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:01,694
Next spring,

818
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,596
the department
would capture Luna,

819
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:04,730
put him on a truck,

820
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:06,199
drive over 200 miles,

821
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,203
and turn him loose
near his family.

822
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:13,606
There were cheers in public,

823
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,142
but there was trouble
behind the scenes.

824
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,346
The department's
own scientists weren't sure

825
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,481
Luna's family would accept him.

826
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:24,750
Most of US were not convinced
it would be successful.

827
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:26,419
Some people have a blind faith

828
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:28,654
that there is absolutely
no question that it'll work.

829
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:30,256
But a lot of US,

830
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,291
who actually know these animals
in great detail,

831
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:33,702
from studying them
in an aquarium setting,

832
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:35,566
studying them in the wild,
were not so certain.

833
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,533
What would happen
if the reunion didn't work?

834
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:42,701
Enjoy the show,

835
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:46,705
and the rest of your day
here at six flags marine world!

836
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:51,377
Marine parks
have taught a lot of people

837
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,313
about the amazing intelligence
and beauty of orcas.

838
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:55,448
"Shouka" and "Merlin"

839
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:57,283
are ambassadors
for their species,

840
00:42:57,316 --> 00:42:58,617
and it is our responsibility

841
00:42:58,651 --> 00:43:01,387
to not only provide them
with the best care...

842
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,622
But to many of the people
who know orcas in the wild,

843
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:05,624
this looks like a prison.

844
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:09,128
But, very quietly,

845
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:11,264
the department made
detailed arrangements

846
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,099
to send Luna to an aquarium

847
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,600
if a reunion attempt was made,

848
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,535
and didn't work right away.

849
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:18,304
Due diligence demands
that, okay,

850
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:21,340
if we do take this whale down
to a highly-populated area,

851
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:23,509
where there are hundreds
of times more boats,

852
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,579
more potential problems
for people and the whale,

853
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:28,414
what are we
going to do about it?

854
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:30,183
And that was the reason

855
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:33,319
behind discussing
captivity options.

856
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:36,455
That was their bottom line...

857
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,258
They were going to sell him
to an aquarium.

858
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:40,793
The department didn't say much

859
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,528
about the captivity option,

860
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,630
but rumours flew
like sparks in the wind

861
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,699
to Nootka sound,

862
00:43:46,732 --> 00:43:49,702
and set a fire
among the first nations.

863
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:53,206
That was totally disrespectful
for the first nations.

864
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,807
If you want to capture a whale

865
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,442
and throw him in a cage
or something,

866
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:57,576
it's like, "no way."

867
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,777
But, now,

868
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:01,214
there's a new, unexpected
opposition.

869
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:02,624
Certainly has
a lot of cultural and...

870
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:03,816
Now,

871
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,718
chief Mike Maquinna,
ambrose's son,

872
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:08,554
started telling the press
Luna shouldn't be moved at all.

873
00:44:08,587 --> 00:44:11,090
Myself and the people
of our nations

874
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:14,827
would prefer that, uh,
nature take its course,

875
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,531
uh, meaning that the whale
be left alone.

876
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:23,136
The department spent the winter

877
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:24,537
making capture plans,

878
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,839
and trying to maintain
the wall between species.

879
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,707
Friendship with that whale

880
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:30,785
would have been the worst thing
that you could have done to him,

881
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:34,447
and even if he's, you know,
frustrated, disappointed,

882
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,350
whatever those feelings
that a whale might have...

883
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,885
I don't think Luna
was really into frustration

884
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:41,520
and disappointment.

885
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:46,425
So, he took his 3,000 pounds
of muscle and charm

886
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:47,693
and went to the slow boats,

887
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,163
where they'd known him
for years.

888
00:44:50,196 --> 00:44:51,564
He'd catch up to the boat,

889
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:53,699
and then go right to the front,
right to the bow,

890
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,434
and put his tail up,
or get some teeth,

891
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:56,502
on the front of the boat.

892
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:58,671
And he'd just lay there.

893
00:44:58,704 --> 00:45:00,606
And he'd fall off
and get back up,

894
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,916
and flip over,
and get his tail on there again.

895
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,377
It was just hilarious.

896
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,782
It was time
for Nootka sound to say goodbye.

897
00:45:08,815 --> 00:45:10,817
An unexpected guest had come.

898
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,552
He had needed something.

899
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:14,354
People loved him,

900
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,190
but didn't agree
on how to show it.

901
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:18,392
They couldn't even agree
on who he was.

902
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,361
Was he a problem, or a spirit?

903
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:24,364
Or was he just a lonely kid?

904
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:31,271
I think that Luna has
a very special situation,

905
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:35,242
and he's impacting people
in a really grand way.

906
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:45,319
It was spring.

907
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:47,787
The department brought
people, money

908
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,856
and tension to Nootka sound...

909
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:52,759
And, suddenly,

910
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,295
Luna started getting
what he wanted.

911
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:58,865
He hung out with the crew
that was building the net pen,

912
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:01,235
and ed thorburn was told
to train him with play,

913
00:46:01,268 --> 00:46:03,337
because the last game
would end in the net.

914
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,871
When we get the net pen
in place,

915
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:06,540
what we're going to try to do,

916
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:08,975
is have him follow me
into the net pen,

917
00:46:09,008 --> 00:46:11,211
close the gate.

918
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:12,512
But, you know,

919
00:46:12,546 --> 00:46:13,880
that's a lot of credibility

920
00:46:13,913 --> 00:46:15,815
I'm going to lose
with the animal, too.

921
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:19,286
Yeah, I feel guilty now,
and I haven't even done it.

922
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:28,562
People have been
asking US the question

923
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:30,406
of whether we're going to
intervene on the capture.

924
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,433
We can't really answer that
at this time, uh,

925
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:35,402
but the anxiety level is up.

926
00:46:36,803 --> 00:46:38,272
Most people didn't think

927
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:40,607
this little band
could stop the department.

928
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,776
Ed thorburn
didn't think they'd even try.

929
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:44,744
My own personal belief
is they won't interfere,

930
00:46:44,778 --> 00:46:45,912
but they won't assist.

931
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:50,317
Then Suzanne and I
came down to the dock one night,

932
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,961
two days before
the capture was scheduled,

933
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:54,020
and here were two canoes
out on the water.

934
00:46:54,053 --> 00:46:55,755
Luna was with them.

935
00:46:55,789 --> 00:46:58,525
So was ed thorburn.
That was a surprise.

936
00:46:58,558 --> 00:47:01,695
But we guessed
that he'd made a deal with him,

937
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:05,632
to let them sing to Luna,
and say goodbye.

938
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:34,728
That night,

939
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:36,796
a researcher
who'd been listening for months

940
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,898
recorded these underwater calls.

941
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:40,767
So I remember thinking, like,
"this is new."

942
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,402
I just remember
they were different.

943
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:43,670
They were like...

944
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:47,607
it was more like he was...
Singing himself.

945
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:57,551
The capture team
gathered, over 150 strong.

946
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,052
The press was here.

947
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,787
Marilyn Joyce was here.

948
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,689
The project manager was here.

949
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:04,524
We're getting
pretty close right now.

950
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:07,827
D.f.o. Have given the go-ahead
to do the capture at this point.

951
00:48:07,861 --> 00:48:10,430
So, right now,
I'm... I'm not too anxious.

952
00:48:10,464 --> 00:48:12,766
But,
as the capture day approached,

953
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,669
the department got
more and more secretive.

954
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:17,637
Now all of Nootka sound
was suspicious

955
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:19,639
that Luna might not be
going home at all.

956
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:23,577
There was just
too many unanswered questions,

957
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,080
and everyone kind of knew,
that once it went into a net,

958
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:31,585
it was going to, well, seaworld,
or another form of captivity.

959
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,920
So I think even people
that wouldn't have minded that,

960
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,389
just got put off

961
00:48:35,422 --> 00:48:38,024
that the government
was lying to them,

962
00:48:38,057 --> 00:48:40,694
and treating people like morons.

963
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:43,730
The time came.

964
00:48:43,763 --> 00:48:45,732
It was the 16th of June,

965
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:47,000
almost three years

966
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:49,736
since Luna showed up
in Nootka sound.

967
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:53,072
Dozens of journalists
came to gold river.

968
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:54,584
Most of them planned to be here
just one day.

969
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:55,909
Everyone expected

970
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:57,711
that Luna would be in the pen
by nightfall.

971
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:01,047
They were wrong.

972
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:06,786
The mowachaht/muchalaht people
took the only weapons they had,

973
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,855
belief, canoes, and song,

974
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:10,690
and went back out on the water.

975
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:12,692
They hadn't been
saying goodbye...

976
00:49:12,726 --> 00:49:14,428
They'd been saying hello.

977
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:15,695
The number-one priority

978
00:49:15,729 --> 00:49:18,632
was just to keep him
away from the pen.

979
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:21,134
Somewhere along the line,
it dawned on US,

980
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,838
that, "my god, we're fighting
for his freedom."

981
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:26,540
Like we're fighting for,

982
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:30,376
at the time, it seemed like
for his very life.

983
00:49:32,712 --> 00:49:34,448
To everyone's astonishment,

984
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:35,949
including the paddlers
themselves,

985
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:39,453
Luna followed them
30 nautical miles from the pen.

986
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:42,556
But something else
happened that day.

987
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:43,923
As the canoes went through

988
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:46,693
Luna's familiar home territory
of Mooyah Bay,

989
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:50,129
suddenly, Luna started
jumping and splashing.

990
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:52,532
In all these miles,

991
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:54,868
this was the only place
he did this.

992
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:57,837
Orcas often slap the water
to communicate,

993
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,939
but what was he trying to say?

994
00:50:01,808 --> 00:50:03,743
Orcas probably
don't use anything

995
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:05,812
like what we think of
as language,

996
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:07,156
but he was doing
all kinds of things

997
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,882
to try to get through to US,

998
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:11,985
and we were all kind of
wrapped up in a story

999
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:14,954
about wildlife management
and ancient traditions,

1000
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:17,023
but maybe Luna's idea
about what was going on

1001
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,625
was entirely different,

1002
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:21,562
and he was shouting at US
to pay attention.

1003
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:25,199
After that, whenever he slapped
the water, I wondered,

1004
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:27,668
"what are we missing?"

1005
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,707
The first day,
we knew we were in trouble.

1006
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,108
So that's when we decided,

1007
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:37,512
"okay, this is now
a totally different story."

1008
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,748
Early the next morning,

1009
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:42,583
ed thorburn went far
from the pen

1010
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:43,827
and started bringing Luna back,

1011
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:46,487
but the canoes got in the way.

1012
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:49,089
Members
in the traditional canoes,

1013
00:50:49,123 --> 00:50:51,626
we ask you not to interfere
with this operation.

1014
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:53,994
Keep paddling, guys!
You're doing good!

1015
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:56,964
They strike me as being
very ready for action,

1016
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:57,998
these boys.

1017
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,203
The press called it
a "tug-of-whale,"

1018
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:05,640
but maybe to Luna
it was more like life in a pod.

1019
00:51:05,673 --> 00:51:08,676
All he'd ever seemed
to want from US

1020
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:09,944
was contact,

1021
00:51:09,977 --> 00:51:11,287
and now every day
was full of people

1022
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:12,747
who sang,

1023
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,582
and played,
and looked him in the eye.

1024
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:17,818
People here thought
this was a fight,

1025
00:51:17,852 --> 00:51:21,121
but maybe Luna thought
he'd already won.

1026
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:27,562
You must take this vessel

1027
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:29,564
100 metres out of this area,

1028
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:31,699
or you will be charged.
That includes you.

1029
00:51:31,732 --> 00:51:33,200
The story

1030
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:36,571
Mike and Suzanne had thought
would be simple to cover

1031
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:37,738
wasn't.

1032
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:47,247
Ed was barking
at everyone to keep a distance,

1033
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:49,584
as if he was the one in charge.

1034
00:51:49,617 --> 00:51:51,085
On paper, he was.

1035
00:51:51,118 --> 00:51:53,921
On the water,
it was a bigger guy.

1036
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:06,133
On the morning of June 22nd,

1037
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,035
after a full week of this,

1038
00:52:08,068 --> 00:52:11,906
Luna chose ed,
and the canoe fell behind.

1039
00:52:11,939 --> 00:52:15,009
But then
this most social of whales

1040
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,645
decided to play "Bruno"
in the logs,

1041
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:19,213
and the canoe caught up.

1042
00:52:19,246 --> 00:52:21,982
Ed got him out of the logs,

1043
00:52:22,016 --> 00:52:25,252
but then Luna had to say hello
to a prawn-fishing boat,

1044
00:52:25,285 --> 00:52:27,755
then the canoe
came singing along.

1045
00:52:29,657 --> 00:52:31,692
That was impressive.

1046
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:35,863
I mean, we really were impressed
by their determination,

1047
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:39,767
and that's when
it was solidified to me

1048
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,736
that they weren't
going to go away.

1049
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:43,303
They paddled on and on,

1050
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:44,905
into the growing wind.

1051
00:52:44,939 --> 00:52:46,674
An ancient people,

1052
00:52:46,707 --> 00:52:50,044
trying to make a modern legend
of sea and spirit,

1053
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:52,312
with a little whale.

1054
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:06,393
But ed wasn't
going to go away, either.

1055
00:53:06,426 --> 00:53:09,396
Beyond an island,
he lured Luna back to play,

1056
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:12,232
and the canoes
couldn't catch up.

1057
00:53:12,266 --> 00:53:13,934
Two hours later,

1058
00:53:13,968 --> 00:53:16,637
Mike and Suzanne climbed a hill
near the capture pen

1059
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,207
just in time to watch
ed lead Luna into the pen.

1060
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,043
My chest and my heart,
everything was really heavy.

1061
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,344
I started to cry,

1062
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:25,922
because I thought,
"oh, they've got him!"

1063
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:27,381
To me, it was like,

1064
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:29,494
"holy cow, you know,
this is actually going to work."

1065
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:35,022
But this was odd...

1066
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:39,093
The gate of the pen
wasn't yet closed.

1067
00:53:39,126 --> 00:53:40,761
I was willing to kill somebody.

1068
00:53:40,795 --> 00:53:42,029
That's what I was...

1069
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:44,331
I was so furious,
it was unbelievable.

1070
00:53:44,364 --> 00:53:46,333
I know it was a source of
frustration.

1071
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:48,068
I think, for ed,
and the d.F.O. Crews,

1072
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:49,379
and for everybody, it was like,
"what

1073
00:53:49,403 --> 00:53:50,905
you're not going to
pull the net?"

1074
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:52,382
It was like, "no, we're not
going to pull it

1075
00:53:52,406 --> 00:53:54,217
unless we're really certain
we're going to get him."

1076
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:55,910
It was so baffling!

1077
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:58,746
They had been trying so hard
for days to catch him,

1078
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:00,290
and, all of a sudden,
here he is, in the pen,

1079
00:54:00,314 --> 00:54:02,449
and we were sure
that they would close the gate,

1080
00:54:02,482 --> 00:54:05,152
but then, suddenly,
like a Hollywood movie,

1081
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:07,454
we hear these canoes
in the distance,

1082
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:09,089
all this singing,

1083
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:10,691
and Luna must have
heard them, too,

1084
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:12,102
because, all of a sudden,
he slips out of the pen,

1085
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:14,862
and swims off,
to be with his friends.

1086
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:19,834
It was a Luna flotilla.

1087
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:21,235
But then ed went out,

1088
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:22,937
and Luna went over to say hi,

1089
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,372
and then, out of the flotilla
came a little tin boat,

1090
00:54:25,405 --> 00:54:27,407
driven by a guy named Rudy,

1091
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:30,978
and it turned into
another little tug-of-whale.

1092
00:54:31,011 --> 00:54:33,180
Suzanne and I
were still up on that hill,

1093
00:54:33,213 --> 00:54:35,082
all caught up
in this political fight,

1094
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:37,317
which I guess shows you
how easy it is

1095
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:38,786
to get accustomed

1096
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:41,388
to even the most extraordinary
things.

1097
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,794
I mean, there are
political fights everywhere,

1098
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:51,365
but where else in the world
would a little wild whale,

1099
00:54:51,398 --> 00:54:52,867
by his own choice,

1100
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,302
take all day
and make all this effort,

1101
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:58,205
and swim, I don't know,
50 nautical miles,

1102
00:54:58,238 --> 00:55:02,076
just to spend his time
with human beings?

1103
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,423
Two days later,
the department gave up.

1104
00:55:24,564 --> 00:55:27,301
We did it!
All of you, we did it!

1105
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:30,938
We just did it
with some water, junk food,

1106
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:32,472
and baloney sandwiches!

1107
00:55:37,478 --> 00:55:38,914
I was really disappointed.

1108
00:55:38,947 --> 00:55:40,081
I was really relieved.

1109
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:41,817
We are a proud nation!

1110
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:42,951
A sense of relief...

1111
00:55:42,984 --> 00:55:44,195
It was unbelievable.
It was great.

1112
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,188
Our grandfathers
are smiling at US today.

1113
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:48,399
It was that kind of disbelief.

1114
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,533
But also a sense of,
"what's next?"

1115
00:55:49,557 --> 00:55:51,426
I would've been in those canoes.

1116
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:52,393
We didn't get it done.

1117
00:55:52,427 --> 00:55:53,895
I was so proud of them!

1118
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:56,932
And it was
a tremendously emotional moment.

1119
00:55:56,965 --> 00:55:59,200
Tsu-xiit is still free.

1120
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,802
Whoo-hoo!

1121
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:03,972
There is no way
that we compromise our position

1122
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:05,206
in any way.

1123
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,809
And our position is,

1124
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:11,847
let nature take its course,
and leave tsu-xiit alone!

1125
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,880
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1126
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:19,520
That was exactly what happened.

1127
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:21,489
Luna was left alone.

1128
00:56:23,624 --> 00:56:25,927
Now that the human fight
was over,

1129
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:28,263
the canoes
were taken off the water.

1130
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:31,132
Ed no longer went out to play.

1131
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:34,102
And you could feel
that feeling...

1132
00:56:34,135 --> 00:56:36,371
Like, you know,
you could just feel,

1133
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:38,239
he must have...

1134
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:42,077
"What did I do wrong?
How come everybody hates me?"

1135
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:45,446
Mike and Suzanne
were still here.

1136
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,149
We just...
We just couldn't leave.

1137
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:49,985
The big trouble on Nootka sound
had ended

1138
00:56:50,018 --> 00:56:52,553
for the press, the department,
the first nations...

1139
00:56:53,922 --> 00:56:56,457
But not for Luna.

1140
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,262
With so many
of his friends gone,

1141
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,464
Luna started making more contact
with people

1142
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:06,267
who were definitely
not his friends.

1143
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:08,870
Keith bell's sailboat
had been damaged,

1144
00:57:08,904 --> 00:57:10,939
and when Luna scared him
in a skiff,

1145
00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:12,373
Keith called the police.

1146
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:14,151
If you're going to
get rcmp into any action at all,

1147
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:16,244
you gotta lay a charge
of some kind,

1148
00:57:16,277 --> 00:57:19,280
and I wanted to lay a charge of
attempted murder on the whale.

1149
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:21,983
Well, this is the tiller
off the boat,

1150
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:23,451
and he broke this.

1151
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:25,586
"Whale charged
with attempted murder."

1152
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,356
The press couldn't resist.

1153
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:30,458
It was even in the paper
in Montreal,

1154
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:32,894
and it came back to gold river
on the Chicago news.

1155
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:35,563
But the rcmp said,

1156
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:38,466
unfortunately,
they couldn't prosecute Luna,

1157
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:41,102
because they didn't
have jurisdiction.

1158
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:44,039
They said, well, that whale
doesn't belong to US anyway.

1159
00:57:44,072 --> 00:57:46,374
It's an American whale.

1160
00:57:50,645 --> 00:57:52,447
Keith was not amused.

1161
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,682
I wanted the rcmp
to get involved in it,

1162
00:57:54,715 --> 00:57:57,318
because if there was a cougar
in our backyard,

1163
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,020
they would have come
and shot the cougar.

1164
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:01,422
This was the sort of thing

1165
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:04,592
that made some people
want to kill Luna.

1166
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,594
If he dropped the kicker motor
often enough,

1167
00:58:06,627 --> 00:58:08,229
the bracket would break,

1168
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:10,698
and the motor would be gone.

1169
00:58:14,002 --> 00:58:15,971
I think most people

1170
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:17,548
are afraid of things
they don't understand.

1171
00:58:17,572 --> 00:58:20,141
So they treat it like a rat,
and shoot it.

1172
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:22,077
To hear the amount of people

1173
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,445
that were willing to go
and shoot it themselves,

1174
00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:26,714
just because
it bumped their kicker bracket,

1175
00:58:26,747 --> 00:58:29,584
or... you know?

1176
00:58:29,617 --> 00:58:31,252
It says something,

1177
00:58:31,286 --> 00:58:33,246
I'm not even sure what it says,
but it's not good.

1178
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,972
And then,

1179
00:58:51,006 --> 00:58:52,583
when the department
told the first nations

1180
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:55,676
to run another one of those
tough-love stewardship programs

1181
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,212
that didn't work,

1182
00:58:57,245 --> 00:58:59,080
Jamie James, who was
the fisheries manager

1183
00:58:59,114 --> 00:59:00,448
for the first nations,

1184
00:59:00,481 --> 00:59:01,682
had a different idea.

1185
00:59:06,721 --> 00:59:10,358
I thought it was kind of
my responsibility to ensure

1186
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:12,460
that, you know, go see him
and say, you know,

1187
00:59:12,493 --> 00:59:14,029
"you're safe here."

1188
00:59:14,062 --> 00:59:17,632
You see a friendly face,
sort of thing, you know?

1189
00:59:17,665 --> 00:59:20,768
It's a strong bond
that me and Luna have.

1190
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,270
I think I owed it to him,

1191
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:25,106
and, you know, let him know
I am still here.

1192
00:59:34,815 --> 00:59:38,353
Jamie just ignored
the wall between species.

1193
00:59:38,386 --> 00:59:41,089
Luna would come up and play,

1194
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:42,399
then he'd go off,
and go fishing,

1195
00:59:42,423 --> 00:59:44,059
and then he'd come back.

1196
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,328
No pressure.

1197
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:49,064
No ditching.

1198
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:58,339
I was out there on Nootka sound

1199
00:59:58,373 --> 01:00:00,475
for about a week,
filming Jamie with Luna.

1200
01:00:00,508 --> 01:00:03,711
All this time, we had been told

1201
01:00:03,744 --> 01:00:06,747
that this kind of relationship
with Luna was wrong,

1202
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:08,783
but this just seemed natural.

1203
01:00:14,855 --> 01:00:17,092
During the short time that fall

1204
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,693
when Jamie was being his friend,

1205
01:00:18,726 --> 01:00:22,063
Luna got into no trouble at all.

1206
01:00:34,509 --> 01:00:36,544
You know, Luna
is a pretty strong character.

1207
01:00:36,577 --> 01:00:38,513
He learned to survive
on his own.

1208
01:00:38,546 --> 01:00:40,215
He did it all himself.

1209
01:00:40,248 --> 01:00:43,751
He fed himself, you know,
he did everything he could.

1210
01:00:43,784 --> 01:00:46,387
So, I mean, really,
I didn't do too much,

1211
01:00:46,421 --> 01:00:48,257
other than be his friend.

1212
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,227
That was my...
My greatest honour,

1213
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,295
was being able to do that.

1214
01:00:55,897 --> 01:01:00,536
But the department
told him to stop.

1215
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:06,508
That next summer,
Luna turned six years old,

1216
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,310
and things got worse.

1217
01:01:08,344 --> 01:01:11,247
People knew
it couldn't go on this way.

1218
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,614
Something would happen.

1219
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:15,617
Would he be shot?
Or hit by a prop?

1220
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:17,419
Would he accidentally

1221
01:01:17,453 --> 01:01:19,588
spill a kayaker
into the cold water,

1222
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:24,793
and bring tragedy to the people
he so wanted to befriend?

1223
01:01:24,826 --> 01:01:26,862
The department knew
the risks were growing,

1224
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,630
but it did nothing new.

1225
01:01:42,511 --> 01:01:43,845
Then, one day,

1226
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:46,215
a first nations canoe
came through Mooyah Bay.

1227
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:50,519
Mike and Suzanne sat back

1228
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:52,488
and watched the most simple
but mysterious thing

1229
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,722
at the heart of this story...

1230
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:57,393
A young whale,
making human friends.

1231
01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:05,734
The first nations
thought he was supernatural,

1232
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:06,835
and we didn't,

1233
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:08,504
but the reality was,

1234
01:02:08,537 --> 01:02:11,240
we all knew we were trying to
learn something here

1235
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:13,442
that none of US understood.

1236
01:02:17,913 --> 01:02:20,349
There're a lot of
lessons to be gleaned

1237
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:22,484
from this whole adventure...

1238
01:02:22,518 --> 01:02:26,688
And people have to just take it
for what it's worth.

1239
01:02:26,722 --> 01:02:30,292
It's going to be
different for each one.

1240
01:02:35,531 --> 01:02:38,334
That day, when the paddlers
tried to go to shore,

1241
01:02:38,367 --> 01:02:40,502
Luna didn't seem
to want them to leave.

1242
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:42,771
Again and again,

1243
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:46,408
he turned the bow
away from the beach.

1244
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:50,612
Finally, the paddlers got a tow,
and they left him.

1245
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,996
One day, a man named Alan Dunham

1246
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:09,965
was crossing a passage,

1247
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:13,502
and Luna tried to keep him
from going ashore, too.

1248
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:16,538
When I saw this, I thought,
"this will be the excuse."

1249
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:17,739
If he spills this guy,

1250
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:19,441
the department will be here
tomorrow

1251
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:21,477
with cops and nets and guns.

1252
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,946
But Alan was calm
and Jamie was nearby,

1253
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,549
so was Mike.

1254
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:28,826
That's affirmative.
You want me over there?

1255
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,287
Yeah.

1256
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,988
They gathered around Alan.

1257
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:38,327
Luna looked as if
he was just waiting

1258
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,297
to see what this meeting
was all about.

1259
01:03:43,899 --> 01:03:45,467
Then Jamie and Luna

1260
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:48,370
turned this moment away
from disaster so easily.

1261
01:03:51,072 --> 01:03:53,041
Jamie looked in his eye,

1262
01:03:53,074 --> 01:03:58,046
and Luna rested,
at peace and safe.

1263
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:05,754
But the department
still had no plan for Luna

1264
01:04:05,787 --> 01:04:07,055
except to wait,

1265
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:09,325
and let danger come again.

1266
01:04:27,943 --> 01:04:30,646
One day during
this difficult summer,

1267
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:32,914
Mike was at the log sort
in Mooyah Bay,

1268
01:04:32,948 --> 01:04:36,418
watching Luna play "Bruno"
in the logs.

1269
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:43,792
And then,
"stealth whale" came to visit.

1270
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:47,463
So, Mike zipped
over to the dock,

1271
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:50,999
hoping Luna would go back
to being Bruno.

1272
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,805
No luck.

1273
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:04,780
Finally, Suzanne and Mike

1274
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:06,782
pulled the boat
all the way out of the water,

1275
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,918
and left Luna waiting for them
to come back.

1276
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:13,755
It was just a momentary thing,

1277
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:16,758
but, suddenly, I'd had enough
of ditching him...

1278
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,730
So I broke the rules.

1279
01:05:21,763 --> 01:05:24,533
I looked at him...

1280
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:27,503
and I felt a kind of vertigo.

1281
01:05:27,536 --> 01:05:31,106
It was like looking over a cliff
into time,

1282
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,509
and I thought,

1283
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:34,810
millions of years,

1284
01:05:34,843 --> 01:05:37,112
these whales have been
in the sea,

1285
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:39,548
and people have only started
getting to know them

1286
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:41,550
in the last few generations.

1287
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,151
Millions of years apart,

1288
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:44,986
and we meet at a dock
in Mooyah Bay,

1289
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:48,790
and we look at each other,
and we recognize something.

1290
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:50,959
"This isn't casual stuff,"
I thought.

1291
01:05:50,992 --> 01:05:52,160
This isn't insignificant.

1292
01:05:52,193 --> 01:05:55,864
I don't know what it is, but...

1293
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:58,033
It's not insignificant.

1294
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:00,702
I looked at him,

1295
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:02,505
I looked at that awareness
look back at me,

1296
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:03,773
and I thought,

1297
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:06,543
"we've treated you
with inconsistency,

1298
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:08,778
"we've treated you with disdain,

1299
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:12,615
but, still, you trust US."

1300
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:16,653
"How in the world," I thought,

1301
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:18,888
"will we ever be forgiven,
by life,

1302
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:20,490
"by nature,

1303
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:21,991
"by ourselves,

1304
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:24,026
"if we let you suffer

1305
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:27,530
just because you're trying
to be our friend?"

1306
01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:38,841
You know,

1307
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,877
journalists are never supposed
to get involved

1308
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,512
in the stories
they're trying to cover,

1309
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:44,213
or try to change the outcome.

1310
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:48,017
But, for US, it felt unethical
not to do something.

1311
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,151
Here we were,

1312
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:50,720
were we supposed to just
stand by

1313
01:06:50,753 --> 01:06:52,755
and not help this whale?

1314
01:06:54,256 --> 01:06:55,792
So, we took a deep breath

1315
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:57,226
and we took a stand.

1316
01:06:57,259 --> 01:06:58,728
We started saying

1317
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,464
that maybe what Jamie had done
was right.

1318
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,767
Suzanne and Mike
asked the department

1319
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:06,235
for a permit

1320
01:07:06,268 --> 01:07:08,671
to work with Jamie,
scientists and the public,

1321
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:11,874
to keep Luna safe
by having boats always near him,

1322
01:07:11,908 --> 01:07:13,510
like a pod,

1323
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:15,878
and by giving him consistent,
careful interaction

1324
01:07:15,912 --> 01:07:18,615
when he needed it.

1325
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,920
We just thought
that if you could...

1326
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:26,055
If you could
give Luna friendship

1327
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,190
at boats that were safe,

1328
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:34,664
he might not go looking for it
at boats that were dangerous.

1329
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:35,765
They sent their request

1330
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:37,567
to the department and the press.

1331
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,169
They brought in a boat
Mike could sleep on.

1332
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:43,272
Suzanne stayed on land
to argue for their proposal.

1333
01:07:43,305 --> 01:07:45,074
Mike went out to watch Luna

1334
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:46,776
and to wait for an answer.

1335
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,511
You know,
we couldn't really do anything

1336
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:49,979
until they gave US a permit,

1337
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:52,214
but I thought at least
I could keep watch for him.

1338
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:55,117
Any sign of Luna?

1339
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:56,719
No, not yet.

1340
01:07:56,753 --> 01:07:58,788
He should come and say
hello pretty quick.

1341
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:01,157
So, in the daytime,
I would watch from a distance,

1342
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,727
and at night, I'd anchor,
put down the hydrophone,

1343
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:06,763
and listen.

1344
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:17,807
And, soon, they got
a message from the department.

1345
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,609
It was very simple.

1346
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:22,979
If they got caught
interacting with Luna, it said,

1347
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:25,648
they could be
charged with a crime.

1348
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:30,820
You are trying to assume
you know what they need

1349
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:32,154
because you can give it to them,

1350
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:33,690
versus trying to understand

1351
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:35,267
that these are intelligent,
social creatures,

1352
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,959
and they have their own needs.

1353
01:08:36,993 --> 01:08:38,070
We just don't understand them,

1354
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:39,596
so why would we assume

1355
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:41,006
that we know how to
fill that gap for them,

1356
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,700
and that it will be
better for them?

1357
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:46,202
Boy.

1358
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:51,841
Luna challenged
some of the deepest things

1359
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:53,009
people believe

1360
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,878
about who humans
and animals are.

1361
01:08:55,912 --> 01:08:59,081
Mike and Suzanne weren't
just watching all this anymore.

1362
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:00,850
They were part of it now.

1363
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:07,724
In November,

1364
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:09,792
the mowachaht/muchalaht people

1365
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:11,928
held a potlatch
for ambrose Maquinna,

1366
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:13,930
four years after his death.

1367
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:17,667
This was the official
end of mourning.

1368
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,669
Now many people believed
Luna would disappear.

1369
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:22,371
Right after
the memorial potlatch

1370
01:09:22,404 --> 01:09:24,206
for my grandfather, ambrose,

1371
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,144
a lot of US knew
that he was gonna... go,

1372
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:30,713
but we didn't know how
he was going to go.

1373
01:09:30,747 --> 01:09:33,182
We didn't know
if he was going to die,

1374
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:37,319
or if he was just going to
leave the territory.

1375
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:40,957
I can foresee the time
when... when he figures,

1376
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,626
"well, I've done my best.

1377
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,662
"You folks aren't
learning anything,

1378
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:47,797
it's time for me to go."

1379
01:09:49,732 --> 01:09:53,970
He's giving US every chance.

1380
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:55,371
You know, he's saying,

1381
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:57,907
"here, come on, check it out."
You know?

1382
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,877
Like,
"it's still a beautiful world."

1383
01:10:13,322 --> 01:10:15,725
Mike and Suzanne kept trying

1384
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:17,393
to get that permit.

1385
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:19,762
The department
was kind of waiting,

1386
01:10:19,796 --> 01:10:21,297
and the first nations
were letting go,

1387
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,132
so Suzanne and I
went to offices,

1388
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:25,434
and talked to bureaucrats
and scientists

1389
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:26,969
who listened politely,

1390
01:10:27,003 --> 01:10:28,905
and we said, "all he needs

1391
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:30,840
"is some kind of
consistent contact

1392
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:32,208
"to keep him safe.

1393
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:33,910
Why not give him a chance?"

1394
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:37,313
Again and again,
the answer was "no."

1395
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:40,016
In terms of the proposal,

1396
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:43,853
moving to
that next level of engagement,

1397
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:45,354
certainly,
we were really reluctant

1398
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:47,289
to move down yet another step

1399
01:10:47,323 --> 01:10:51,393
of creating an even closer bond
with people.

1400
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:53,395
West coast
Vancouver island north...

1401
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:54,563
storm warning,

1402
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:57,133
upgraded to
hurricane-force wind warning.

1403
01:10:57,166 --> 01:11:02,004
Southeast gales 4-0
to storm-force 5-0 knots,

1404
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:04,340
with local
hurricane-force winds.

1405
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,943
Winter came to Nootka sound.

1406
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:14,884
A fisherman told me
right there on the dock,

1407
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:18,756
he said, "Luna's going to
be killed this winter."

1408
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:21,258
And I said, "look, somebody goes
out there and shoots Luna,

1409
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:23,460
they're gonna get caught,
they're gonna get arrested."

1410
01:11:23,493 --> 01:11:25,395
The guy said, "no, they aren't.

1411
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:27,197
"There's lots of
bad weather out there.

1412
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:28,766
Nobody's ever going to
find out."

1413
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,469
After the storm,

1414
01:11:32,502 --> 01:11:35,472
Mike went back out
to Mooyah Bay.

1415
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:38,475
Luna wasn't there.

1416
01:11:38,508 --> 01:11:40,744
He spent the night,

1417
01:11:40,778 --> 01:11:43,313
but there were no calls
on the hydrophone.

1418
01:11:43,346 --> 01:11:45,082
In the morning,

1419
01:11:45,115 --> 01:11:48,285
Nootka sound looked really big
and empty,

1420
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:50,754
and I realized,
that for Suzanne and me,

1421
01:11:50,788 --> 01:11:52,990
life had been
completely transformed

1422
01:11:53,023 --> 01:11:56,193
by our affection
for a little whale.

1423
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:03,801
Maybe it was

1424
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:07,270
that bond we so lightly
call "friendship"...

1425
01:12:07,304 --> 01:12:11,441
That grows like mist...

1426
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:14,177
But holds like iron.

1427
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:20,550
He went looking
far from Mooyah Bay,

1428
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,452
out toward the open sea.

1429
01:12:22,485 --> 01:12:24,955
Then, he thought he saw a spout.

1430
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:27,024
He aimed the camera.

1431
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:46,810
He slowed the boat
and Luna came right over.

1432
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:56,353
The truth of that moment is,

1433
01:12:56,386 --> 01:13:00,223
that when he came over,
I... I sang to him.

1434
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:03,060
I was so happy, I sang,

1435
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:05,795
and it's a good thing
it wasn't recorded.

1436
01:13:07,264 --> 01:13:08,966
And I thought,

1437
01:13:08,999 --> 01:13:11,534
"we humans don't even
understand each other,

1438
01:13:11,568 --> 01:13:13,136
and we still do what we can,"

1439
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:15,839
and that's what it's all about.

1440
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:21,278
So I thought, well, if I have to
be some kind of Luna outlaw

1441
01:13:21,311 --> 01:13:23,080
to try to keep him safe,

1442
01:13:23,113 --> 01:13:24,982
that's what I'll do.

1443
01:13:27,117 --> 01:13:30,120
I leaned across the wall.

1444
01:13:30,153 --> 01:13:34,824
In that cold water,
his skin was warm.

1445
01:13:45,903 --> 01:13:48,638
All my education
and training involves

1446
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:52,442
things that you can
somehow quantify,

1447
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:57,114
but there are these...
"Uncomprehendables" almost,

1448
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:58,257
you know,
these things out there,

1449
01:13:58,281 --> 01:14:00,150
that something's going on,

1450
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:03,286
somethin' is going on
in an interconnectedness,

1451
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,956
of a lot of life on this planet.

1452
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:08,158
If we're going to get at

1453
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:13,163
that big sort of
unmeasurable thing out there,

1454
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:16,666
as to what are the connections
in the species...

1455
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,368
I think he had it.

1456
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:23,040
He was just as curious about US,
as we were about him.

1457
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:27,510
Over the next few weeks,

1458
01:14:27,544 --> 01:14:31,614
Mike smuggled friendship
into Nootka sound.

1459
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,585
He knew he might be caught,

1460
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:37,554
but at least
when Luna was with him,

1461
01:14:37,587 --> 01:14:39,189
Luna was safe.

1462
01:14:43,726 --> 01:14:45,462
Getting to know Luna

1463
01:14:45,495 --> 01:14:48,331
was not like
one of those fairy tales,

1464
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:50,167
where people and animals
just sort of meet

1465
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,069
and start chatting.

1466
01:14:52,102 --> 01:14:54,371
Up close, Luna was, if anything,

1467
01:14:54,404 --> 01:14:57,607
he was more mysterious
than he was at a distance.

1468
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,209
He was a complete life,

1469
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:02,479
full of awareness
and complexity,

1470
01:15:02,512 --> 01:15:07,517
as deep and unfamiliar
as the sea itself.

1471
01:15:10,053 --> 01:15:12,155
When I talked
and Luna slapped his tail,

1472
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:15,959
neither of US had a clue
what the other meant.

1473
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:22,132
We were like a couple of kids,
you know?

1474
01:15:22,165 --> 01:15:25,735
Alone on a playground
with no language to help US,

1475
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:28,371
who played anyway,

1476
01:15:28,405 --> 01:15:32,209
because what we shared mattered.

1477
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,194
I used to think

1478
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:54,597
that the age of exploration
was over...

1479
01:15:54,631 --> 01:15:57,567
That there wasn't much left
of strangeness and beauty

1480
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,036
on this planet

1481
01:15:59,069 --> 01:16:01,571
that humans hadn't already seen.

1482
01:16:01,604 --> 01:16:04,407
Thankfully, I was wrong.

1483
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:09,046
The people of Nootka sound,
who looked into Luna's eyes,

1484
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:11,614
went far
into the edge of the unknown,

1485
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:15,218
when they tried to be friends
with a whale.

1486
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:21,791
On the 5th of march,

1487
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:25,528
the bilge pump quit
in Mike's boat,

1488
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:28,665
and the rain filled it
halfway up with water,

1489
01:16:28,698 --> 01:16:30,368
which made it very heavy.

1490
01:16:30,401 --> 01:16:32,703
With the motor roaring,
he could only go 8 knots.

1491
01:16:32,736 --> 01:16:35,806
Luna loved that blast
and splash,

1492
01:16:35,839 --> 01:16:38,509
and he surfed along
for at least a mile,

1493
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:41,612
but then Mike had to
leave Luna for a few days

1494
01:16:41,645 --> 01:16:43,414
for a family visit.

1495
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,320
Then, on the day
Mike was supposed to come back,

1496
01:16:49,353 --> 01:16:51,322
a newspaper asked him
for a photograph,

1497
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:55,093
and he watched the tape again
and stopped it right...

1498
01:16:55,126 --> 01:16:57,728
There.

1499
01:17:00,264 --> 01:17:03,567
So, the last time I saw Luna

1500
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:07,171
was the last time
everyone saw Luna.

1501
01:17:15,113 --> 01:17:16,614
It was an accident.

1502
01:17:16,647 --> 01:17:20,151
He'd gotten too close
to a propeller...

1503
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:23,254
But I'll never get over that.

1504
01:17:23,287 --> 01:17:25,523
I promised
I'd keep watch for him,

1505
01:17:25,556 --> 01:17:27,825
but I wasn't there.

1506
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,237
The day after Luna died,

1507
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,439
Mike and I went out
to Mooyah Bay

1508
01:17:41,472 --> 01:17:42,706
with Donna Schneider,

1509
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,384
who had loved him
since that first July day

1510
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:45,743
so long ago.

1511
01:17:49,813 --> 01:17:51,315
We just kept thinking

1512
01:17:51,349 --> 01:17:53,284
that Luna was going to
do "stealth whale"

1513
01:17:53,317 --> 01:17:55,386
right up through the flowers.

1514
01:17:58,689 --> 01:18:01,325
It's almost as if
an alien came down

1515
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:02,660
and we shot it, you know,

1516
01:18:02,693 --> 01:18:04,528
because it was blocking traffic.

1517
01:18:04,562 --> 01:18:07,731
But that was one of
the worst days of my life.

1518
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:10,434
Just the bottom of my heart
just fell.

1519
01:18:10,468 --> 01:18:12,136
I just...

1520
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,237
God.

1521
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:26,910
To Suzanne and me,

1522
01:19:26,944 --> 01:19:30,514
this last journey was sad,
but it was wonderful.

1523
01:19:30,548 --> 01:19:32,250
Suzanne and Donna organized it,

1524
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:34,452
but it was three months
after Luna died,

1525
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:35,986
and we had no idea
so many people

1526
01:19:36,019 --> 01:19:38,389
would come all the way
to Nootka sound

1527
01:19:38,422 --> 01:19:40,224
just to go out to Mooyah Bay

1528
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:42,960
and throw flowers
for a little whale.

1529
01:19:42,993 --> 01:19:46,464
This is his place,

1530
01:19:46,497 --> 01:19:47,998
and, soon, we're going to...

1531
01:19:48,031 --> 01:19:50,668
Slow down, come to a stop,

1532
01:19:50,701 --> 01:19:52,970
and give US all a chance

1533
01:19:53,003 --> 01:19:54,772
to think about Luna,

1534
01:19:54,805 --> 01:19:57,675
tsu-xiit, our friend.

1535
01:19:59,943 --> 01:20:02,580
To me, it was like
an Irish wake, you know?

1536
01:20:02,613 --> 01:20:04,682
The best kind of farewell.

1537
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:06,550
You laugh,

1538
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:09,453
you cry, you laugh again,

1539
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:12,256
and you're really glad
you knew him.

1540
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:18,762
He has... Become a part of me.

1541
01:20:19,897 --> 01:20:22,900
In that sense,
he lives on, you know?

1542
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:24,702
Like, he made a difference, eh?

1543
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:26,837
He made a difference
in this life here.

1544
01:20:29,973 --> 01:20:31,475
But I think

1545
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:33,611
everybody that's been connected
with Luna,

1546
01:20:33,644 --> 01:20:35,546
it is something special.

1547
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:37,915
Just the experience
of knowing that whale

1548
01:20:37,948 --> 01:20:40,518
was worth everything
that happened.

1549
01:20:44,722 --> 01:20:46,924
He was a gift
to the whole town, you know?

1550
01:20:46,957 --> 01:20:49,827
For the kids just to come down
and see him...

1551
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,463
And I will never, ever
forget that.

1552
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:55,333
That will be with me forever.

1553
01:20:57,468 --> 01:21:00,571
I tell this story, first of all,

1554
01:21:00,604 --> 01:21:03,841
to let you know this is one of
the many ways for me

1555
01:21:03,874 --> 01:21:05,075
to remember Luna,

1556
01:21:05,108 --> 01:21:06,910
and it's about the easiest way.

1557
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:08,679
One night,

1558
01:21:08,712 --> 01:21:10,890
and this must've been about
1100 or something like that,

1559
01:21:10,914 --> 01:21:12,316
totally dark out.

1560
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:13,784
We had a little bit
of flashlight.

1561
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:15,719
And you know the phosphorescence
in the water,

1562
01:21:15,753 --> 01:21:17,521
that glow
when they're disturbed, right?

1563
01:21:17,555 --> 01:21:19,390
So, we had Luna coming with US,

1564
01:21:19,423 --> 01:21:21,659
and, oh, man,
it was the amazing thing

1565
01:21:21,692 --> 01:21:22,893
you'd ever see.

1566
01:21:22,926 --> 01:21:24,662
He comes up beside the boat,

1567
01:21:24,695 --> 01:21:26,330
and he's just swimming
next to US,

1568
01:21:26,364 --> 01:21:27,565
while we're bringing him over,

1569
01:21:27,598 --> 01:21:29,066
and he's just
glowing in the water...

1570
01:21:29,099 --> 01:21:31,569
you didn't see Luna,
you saw the outline of Luna,

1571
01:21:31,602 --> 01:21:33,737
and it was just
the most amazing thing

1572
01:21:33,771 --> 01:21:35,506
you could ever see.

1573
01:21:35,539 --> 01:21:39,510
It was just like Luna dancing
in the sky with stars, man.

1574
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:44,516
So, you know,
every time at night,

1575
01:21:44,549 --> 01:21:47,986
if I think of Luna,
I'll look up in the stars.

1576
01:21:57,529 --> 01:21:59,598
All lives end,

1577
01:21:59,631 --> 01:22:01,700
but the best leave gifts.

1578
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,039
Millions of years

1579
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:10,609
had made Luna different from US,

1580
01:22:10,642 --> 01:22:13,778
but he had come through
that wall

1581
01:22:13,812 --> 01:22:16,014
because of what we shared.

1582
01:22:16,047 --> 01:22:19,851
He, too, had carried
that need for others

1583
01:22:19,884 --> 01:22:22,687
across the greatness of time,

1584
01:22:22,721 --> 01:22:26,090
because it is necessary,
not optional.

1585
01:22:30,429 --> 01:22:34,499
As Luna taught US
just by who he was,

1586
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:38,670
this thing we call friendship
is bigger than we know.

1587
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:20,855
Do you see him
out there anywhere?

1588
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:22,080
I don't.

1589
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:24,683
I thought he was
out there by the point.

1590
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:13,064
When your little boy grows up,

1591
01:24:13,097 --> 01:24:15,233
how are you gonna explain
all this to him?

1592
01:24:15,266 --> 01:24:17,669
Uh... I'm going to tell my son

1593
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:19,203
about the greatest thing

1594
01:24:19,237 --> 01:24:21,873
that's ever happened to me
in my life.
