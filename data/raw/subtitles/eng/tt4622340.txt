To help control the flooding,

196
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,056
we created a device about
as big as your hand,

197
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,514
which we call the Regional
Dam Synchronizer.

198

RDS.

199
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,735

and with the satellite...

The flooding is very bad

214

That's why we need a brave
monkey to go up in space

215
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,319
and get that RDS,

216
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,899

Communications Tower in Africa.

218

219
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,587
We're not taking a chance on putting it
directly in a space satellite again.

220
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,457
Why can't you just put
another RDS in that tower

221
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,383
and not go to space?

222
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,592
