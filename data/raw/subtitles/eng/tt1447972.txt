1
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,710
Ever since I was a young girl...

2
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,778
...you'd find me up in my room
dancing in front of the mirror.

3
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,419
Carly and her street dance crew,
smashing it on some stage...

4
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,046
the crowd going wild.

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,887
It kept me going after
I left home.

6
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,959
I came to London where
street dance led me to my new family.

7
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,023
My crew.

8
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,395
I'm still dancing and dreaming
in front of that mirror.

9
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,271
It's just now...

10
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,135
I share my dream.

11
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,534
We're going to be late, man.

12
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,772
Hello? Guys!

13
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,733
We're halfway to New York.

14
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,202
If we dance like that in the finals
who is going to beat us?

15
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,999
Final call for The Surge.

16
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,290
Guys.

17
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,077
- Damn they're good.
- That's why they're champions, Carly.

18
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,826
Guys? Show some class.

19
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,567
- Are you going to get the drinks in, then?
- Maybe.

20
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,683
Jay-2-0, the next UK champions!

21
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,987
I love you.

22
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,289
Your round, Mac!

23
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,693
Guys!

24
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,896
Guys!

25
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,728
Okay, this is... this is the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

26
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,467
I'm going.

27
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,945
- I wanted to end it on a high.
- Yeah, good one, Jay.

28
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,848
I'm serious. I'm under a lot of
pressure right now...

29
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,284
...at work and Uni....

30
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,052
something's got to give,
and it's got to be this.

31
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,487
- So, what are you saying?
- Jay?

32
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,922
We've all got pressures, bruv....

33
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,024
we've got a chance to be
UK champions...

34
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,726
...go to New York and
represent our country.

35
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,061
And I wouldn't do this
if I didn't think you could handle it.

36
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,296
But, you can.

37
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,298
Carly knows all the choreo,
she can take it from here.

38
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,961
- Can't we just talk about it?
- I've made up my mind.

39
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,093
It's your crew now.

40
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,476
I'm gonna miss you guys.

41
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,572
Come on, man.

42
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,380
This is some joke, t'ing.

43
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,279
I'm going to sort it, alright?

44
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,726
- You're not going to change my mind.
- What's wrong, Jay?

45
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,037
I thought you wanted to win?
Be UK Champions!

46
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,800
Sometimes you've got
to make choices.

47
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,236
Why didn't you tell me?
I looked like such an idiot.

48
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,235
I need to get my head straight.
Have a bit of a time out.

49
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,247
Well, have a week off
and come back.

50
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,974
I mean from everything...
everyone.

51
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,787
- I need to get rid of distractions for a bit.
- Thanks, and I'm a distraction?

52
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,254
The biggest.

53
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,261
- Is it because I said I love you?
- No! It's just a time out.

54
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,264
If you take over the crew,
you won't even notice I'm gone.

55
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,033
Okay?

56
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,440
One jacket, with cheese.
Enjoy!

57
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:32,251
- He said it was just a time out.
- Oh, cut and run, Carls.

58
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,981
He's ditched us all five weeks
before the finals!

59
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,655
I can take Jay's place
in the crew...

60
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,727
-...as your man.
- Yeah, right, Eddie.

61
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,995
Keep practicing!

62
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,930
Let's just concentrate on winning
the streetdance finals, yeah?

63
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,890
Yeah, you're right...

64
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,666
...and then he'll want me back,
won't he?

65
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,603
Blonde and northern.
Tragic, really.

66
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,344
Thanks, Eddie...
Let's get down to rehearsals.

67
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,902
Offer still stands, Carly.

68
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,850
Why me? Shouldn't you be
running the crew Shawna?

69
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,752
- I just dance. You see the bigger picture.
- Will they listen to me?

70
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,422
Not if you sound like that.
You've got to be kick-arse Carly, man.

71
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,515
Come on, give me some heat....

72
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,421
Is that all you got?

73
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,426
Allez. Go into the centre.

74
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,344
I don't get it.
He's lost his family, rude boy.

75
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,802
How can we be Jay-2-0 without Jay?
It don't make no sense.

76
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,350
- Why are they stood outside?
- Just march in and show no fear.

77
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,578
Come on, give me some heat.
Give me some.

78
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,518
Come on.

79
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,058
That was lame.
Kick arse Carly, or kissarse?

80
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,116
Come on guys let's get started.

81
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,507
- Okay, guys, slight hitch.
- You didn't book the rehearsal space.

82
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,276
- Was I meant to?
- Come on, Carly.

83
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,310
You were the boss, right?

84
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,312
If you want to lead,
Frankie, be my guest.

85
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,405
Without Jay,
it's a waste of time.

86
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,210
- Steph, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

87
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,619
- We're supposed to be a crew.
- Don't worry. They'll be back.

88
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,485
Guys.... I.... can replace them.

89
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,797
- Come on, Eddie.
- You got to learn from the Da Boogie Man.

90
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,027
Listen, guys,
I don't know how to do this yet.

91
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,690
But what I do know is
we have got a heavy crew.

92
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,338
We've got a final in September.

93
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,674
Can't we just find somewhere to
rehearse and get on with it?

94
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,301
Show Jay what we're made of.

95
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,586
Fix up, man!

96
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,662
My hair!

97
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,323
- Oh, Shawna!
- Sorry.

98
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,621
- Gosh, man.
- Alright, Aimee.

99
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,221
- I think I've got hypothermia.
- You're so extra.

100
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,967
- We're supposed to dance outside.
- Not in England.

101
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,869
- America, maybe.
- Then, let's get there...

102
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,962
...but we've gotta be
UK Champions first.

103
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,308
Only if we rehearse in a studio.
Health and Safety, innit?

104
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,471
But we need money.
Have you got any?

105
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,369
Don't get rude, Carly.

106
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:54,218
If you let us use your studio for free
we'll wear T-shirts advertising your gym.

107
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,949
Hello?

108
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,857
- Bill for your little party last night.
- You what?

109
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,197
You wanna keep your job?

110
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,400
This ain't a drop-in-centre
for you and your mates.

111
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,960
- We only had a few Kit-kats.
- And...?

112
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,571
I need every penny
I've got for dance space.

113
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,538
And...?

114
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,434
Well, why don't you sponsor us?

115
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,434
Now, that is funny.

116
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,284
Right, off your butt, twinkle toes.
Eddie's late, so...

117
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,548
...you deliver these and I'll
think about letting your off the bill.

118
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,887
With a smile, Carly. With a smile.

119
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,386
That's better.

120
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,286
- Are you the sandwich girl?
- Yeah, is it a chicken salad?

121
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,488
- That's me.
- And one drink....

122
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,696
That's $ 5.50, please.

123
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,878
You're welcome to stay and watch,
if you like.

124
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,243
No, you're alright.

125
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,306
I was looking more
at your room, actually.

126
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,949
- That doesn't say much for my dancers.
- No, they're very good.

127
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,023
They're not really feeling it though,
are they? They look bored stiff.

128
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,723
Why are you interested in the room?

129
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,831
I need somewhere to rehearse
for my street dance crew.

130
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,530
I don't suppose you rent these rooms
for a fiver, do you?

131
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,868
- Are you any good?
- God, yeah.

132
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:33,708
Got the UK finals in a few weeks.
We'd blow this lot out of the water.

133
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,347
Okay. I'd like to see it.

134
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,775
- Yeah, right.
- Really.

135
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,353
Well, we're dancing in the shopping
centre tonight, if you do mean it.

136
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,121
- Sevenish.
- If I can get away, I'll come.

137
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,350
Really?

138
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,393
How will I find you?

139
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,393
Follow the crowds.

140
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,918
You are Romeo and Juliet.
You could die for each other.

141
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,255
Could I please get
an inkling of this.

142
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,631
- You need a permit!
- It's our money, we've earnt it.

143
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,397
Ain't that your Justine?

144
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,770
You big, ugly bear....
Justine, you come here.

145
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,478
Is this what you're coming here to do?
Shaming me like this.

146
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,412
- Do you want to get the police involved?
- But, it's ours.

147
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,846
- Cool it, Carls!
- Thanks!

148
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,321
- Everyone in Topshop's watching us.
- So, why didn't you help me?

149
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,429
No, you know what? I don't want to
be a part of this any more.

150
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,296
- Don't you dare flake out, Aimee.
- Flake out of what?

151
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,198
We're going nowhere with you.
Without Jay, this crew's got no chance.

152
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,567
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

153
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,807
You whinge better than
you dance, anyway.

154
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,244
Come on, out! It's all done.
Finished! On your bikes.

155
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,446
On your way. Get your hair done.

156
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,731
You might want to refine some of
those management skills of yours.

157
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,028
Oh, piss off!

158
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,726
Well, whilst you're
in this mood, I will.

159
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,195
Come on.

160
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,204
A little chaotic... but good.
Vibrant.

161
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,036
Come and see me tomorrow
with the rest of your group...

162
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,302
when you find them.

163
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,719
Studio Three, four o'clock.

164
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,160
- Hello?
- Hi...

165
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,861
You shameful girl.

166
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,591
My Justine not dance
with you again.

167
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,700
And then there were two...

168
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,833
I've messed up, haven't l?

169
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,849
Changement, changement,
en force.

170
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,683
Open les bras.
Epaulemnt Allez.

171
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,449
Spot, spot, spot, spot.

172
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,651
Well, would we pay to see
this year's crop?

173
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,860
On present showing none shall
get through the Royal Ballet auditions.

174
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,671
Well, that's not going to dazzle
our benefactors, is it?

175
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,972
What's happened?

176
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,141
More and more I wonder
about our methods.

177
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,870
We drill the passion out of them.

178
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,739
The vital ingredient.
But, I have a plan to drill it back in.

179
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,472
It had better work, Helena.

180
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,817
Funding cuts mean other cuts,
you know?

181
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,484
Today it's all no good.

182
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,452
Carly, Shawna!

183
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,692
Oh, my God, it's you guys!

184
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,526
Oh, excuse me... no, thank you.

185
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,500
Mac!

186
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,281
- You pulled it off, Carly, man.
- Yeah, this place is nice.

187
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,642
Sick, man!

188
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,287
- Can I help you?
- Look at this bronx arse joke, brer.

189
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,493
We were told to be here
by this lady.

190
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,959
It's Helena.

191
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:10,305
- Have you come to watch us?
- Other way round, more like.

192
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,543
Get this one.
'Have I come to watch them'.

193
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,679
Not in those tights.

194
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,977
- Crap!
- Oh, man!

195
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,242
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I just need to lie here a bit.

196
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,946
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the damage.

197
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,487
I see you've made yourself at home,
but you're in the wrong room.

198
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,112
Hurry up, girls.

199
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,560
- Would this suit your needs?
- Are you kidding?

200
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,426
- This is amazing.
- And you've met my dancers?

201
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,839
- Kind of.
- Gabe, lsabella, Bex...

202
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,670
...Chloe and Tomas.

203
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,832
I have a proposition for you.

204
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:29,715
Unlimited access to rehearse here
for your competition.

205
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,579
Nice....

206
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,083
If you include my dancers
in your routine.

207
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,175
What?

208
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,024
- No way, we're a street dance crew, it's....
- No, say, no.

209
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,618
It's like a family,
we can't just take on new people.

210
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,760
Say something to her!

211
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,832
- Helena, with all due respect....
- Thank you, Tomas.

212
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,167
I decide the content
for your final master class.

213
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,260
Sorry, Miss, this sounds crazy.

214
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,972
- I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
- Carly.

215
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,641
Carly, if you don't take my dancers,
I'll have to charge you

216
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,508
for the hire of the studio and,
of course, for damages.

217
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,713
It's your decision.

218
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,515
Where are we going to
get the money from, man?

219
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,973
- We can't win the finals with them!
- I say we do a runner.

220
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,020
Guys, are you blind?
Bendy chicks, come on.

221
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,752
- Can they street dance?
- No, you'll have to teach them.

222
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,828
I'm sorry, her teach us?

223
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,795
Yeah.

224
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,593
This is a unique opportunity.

225
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,494
I hope you'll all embrace it and
perform well for the competition.

226
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,745
- I'm getting my dad to call the Board.
- Look at the state of them.

227
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,837
Like clowns.

228
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,819
Let's just have a go.
They'll be crap.

229
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,219
Then we can have the studio, anyway,
and we can get the others back.

230
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,360
Bruv, it's all green.

231
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,152
Where's the real food, man?

232
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,563
How's learning with those clowns
going to get us into the Royal Ballet?

233
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,569
Helena's known for
her unconventional methods.

234
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,506
We've just got to trust her.

235
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,442
What is street dance?

236
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,913
Oh, don't be a bun head
all your life, Bex.

237
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,683
Hey, this is Jay,
you know what to do.

238
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,727
Hi, Jay. It's me Carly,...

239
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,358
...give me a ring back
when you can, please.

240
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:09,034
If you want, or...
if you can, whatever...

241
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,141
Did I say it's me?
It's Carly.

242
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,289
Focus, focus!

243
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,261
Plus fort, plus fort!

244
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,952
Right, it's your turn.

245
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,916
We've got five weeks and
that's what we need you to do.

246
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,251
Yeah, do we have to be so.... angry?

247
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,861
That's just the way it is,
ballet boy.

248
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,031
- What are they?
- My feet?

249
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,363
That's not suitable.
Where are your trainers?

250
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,406
You know that trainers are
rule number one.

251
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,209
This is what we dance in.
Do you want us to injure ourselves?

252
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,268
Surprised you don't do that
in your tights, mate.

253
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,942
Do I pass?

254
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,914
Just trainers tomorrow, yeah?

255
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,491
Tap, one, tap, one... and again,

256
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,187
...five, six, seven, eight.

257
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,754
Tap one, tap one, tap one.

258
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,025
Let's try it to the music and
follow us if you lose the steps.

259
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,671
- What steps?
- Has she even heard of words?

260
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,273
All those girls are going to need
some hands on help from the Mac Daddy.

261
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,310
Can't you just calm yourself.
Look at them. They might snap, man.

262
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,801
Five, six, seven, eight....

263
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,447
Come on! You're going to be up against the
best street dancers in the UK in a few weeks....

264
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,520
Five, six, seven, eight...

265
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,458
You're going to make us
look like jokers!

266
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,728
Not good enough. Focus, please.

267
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,835
Five, six, seven, eight....

268
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,547
Carly!

269
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,141
- What did you say to her?
- I didn't say anything....

270
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,253
- You lot are bad, man.
- This is your fault, you know?

271
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,880
- Ours?
- Yeah.

272
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,922
- Carly.
- I can't do it.

273
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,927
- How was rehearsal?
- We're too different.

274
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,490
I can't do it.

275
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,601
- Can't or won't?
- Listen, I'm not a teacher, Miss...

276
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,195
Listen, I'm not a teacher, Miss,
and I think you've got the wrong idea about me.

277
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,435
Then that will be $ 250
for the hole in the wall.

278
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,278
Come on, I'm trying to tell you
this crew is going to fail.

279
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,547
Because you think it will,
or because you want it to?

280
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,074
Will you stop answering me with
questions. I don't want to lead this thing.

281
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,380
They're never going to
get it bythe 27th!

282
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,220
Then I'll see you again
when you deliver my lunch.

283
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,593
But, go easy on
the mayonnaise next time.

284
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,164
I feel like a chav.

285
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,598
These things wreak havoc
on one's lines.

286
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,660
- I feel more comfy.
- Hey, guys.

287
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,405
More of them!

288
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,738
- Steph, Frankie!
- You're not doing the finals without us.

289
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,039
- Shawna, tell them what's going on.
- What's going on, B?

290
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,342
We got off on the wrong foot yesterday.
So, let's start again.

291
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,745
Street dance for beginners.

292
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,649
Spread out.
Just move like you are in a club.

293
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,457
This should swing it
for the Royal Ballet...

294
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,322
Just slouch a bit.
Do your own thing.

295
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,918
- We don't do slouching, darling.
- So, improvise.

296
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,122
You know that's
how street dance started.

297
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,492
In the streets, in the clubs.
Ripping up the rules.

298
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,465
We're going to break it down
for you...

299
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,629
Like Brook... Iocking....

300
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,386
Mac... popping....

301
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,200
Steph... breaking....

302
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,048
Come on, Boogie.

303
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,159
Steph, show them your house.

304
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,550
Frankie, new style.

305
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,723
Come on, Shawna. New style.

306
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,143
Finally, Mac. Krumping.

307
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,326
Come on. Pick a move
and get practicing.

308
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,970
Young man, what are you doing?

309
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,765
Delivering.

310
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,476
Helene, can you please
control your street people?

311
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,880
Dancers, Madame. Dancers.

312
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,848
That is a matter of opinion.

313
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,349
- Chicken salad?
- Thank you, Eddie. How's it going?

314
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,686
It's painful, Miss.

315
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,272
You know it might make life easier
if you let me run the classes with you.

316
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,240
Are you trying to tell me
how to do this?

317
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,576
Well, you could do
with the help, couldn't you?

318
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,138
We're doing a street dance...
not a ballet.

319
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,876
So much for ripping up the rules.

320
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,721
- He loves himself.
- Just your type.

321
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,790
- What? It's one way of forgetting Jay.
- I don't want to forget him.

322
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,921
Well, I think the
ballet boys are buff.

323
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,499
We're the teachers.

324
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,527
I'm getting my parents to
call Mr. Harding.

325
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,630
I mean, they're not paying
for disco dancing.

326
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,334
- Dairy's deathly, you know?
- It's alright. It's okay.

327
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,174
Survival has arrived.

328
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,874
- That's my lunch.
- Don't make me laugh.

329
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,345
Look, they can't dance our way
without the proper fuel.

330
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,683
Can't dance? Did you just say
that we can't dance?

331
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,962
That ain't dancing.
That's just flapping about.

332
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,531
Well, at least I don't look like
I'm having a seizure.

333
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,635
Whatever you say, tutu tits.

334
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,035
Tutu what?

335
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,906
You heard.

336
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,843
Food fight!

337
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,105
Discipline. Etiquette. Grace.

338
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,203
A few words I'd like to remind you of.
This is not how we treat our guests.

339
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,844
I can only assume you know what
you're doing bringing these characters in here?

340
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,575
You should be pleased,
Mr. Harding.

341
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,949
Our students are finally
showing some spirit.

342
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,350
Well, I'd rather see it
in their dancing.

343
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,928
You've got to find a way to
work together.

344
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,092
Get out of here.
Have some fun.

345
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,757
Get to know each other.

346
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,663
After you've cleaned up this mess,
of course.

347
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,218
Let's ditch them
when the track stops.

348
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,290
Yeah. We've made the effort.

349
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,464
Shawna!

350
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:56,040
Looks like you're stuck with us.
Come on.

351
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,900
- Carly!
- Aaron, are you alright?

352
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,926
- Are you on?
- We're up next. You been cool, yeah?

353
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,938
- I heard there was a bust up with Jay?
- No, we're just having time out.

354
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,569
- Is this your new crew?
- It's a long story.

355
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,779
Hang around and tell me later.
We'll get a drink or something?

356
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,474
- I will do. Good luck.
- Right, see you later.

357
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,341
Okay, you lot,
you've got to watch these.

358
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,288
These were the UK Street Dance
champions two years ago.

359
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,456
They're the best.

360
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,057
We used to have classes with them.

361
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,390
So this....
this is what we're aiming for.

362
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,391
Who's Jay?

363
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,904
- What's that mumbo jumbo you're writing?
- It's choreography for our routine.

364
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,845
You've got steps,
formations, feelings.

365
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,774
- What, and you're doing that?
- Yeah.

366
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,579
You are actually doing that?

367
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,956
I don't think making sandwiches
is my calling in life.

368
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,355
You've got that right.

369
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,921
Justine, concentrate!

370
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,428
Five, six, seven, eight.

371
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,463
Faster!

372
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,340
Looser.

373
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,947
Okay.

374
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,093
Glimmers of hope, Miss.

375
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,738
Tomas, relax a bit, please.
You're forcing it.

376
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,441
Go back to where you started...

377
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,876
...and try doing it not pointing your toes.
It looks a bit too pretty.

378
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,254
One and two and three and four...

379
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,560
Okay, I'm going to pick it up
from this section, please.

380
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,360
Now, lsabella, I want you to try it
with more attitude.

381
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:45,095
Five, six, seven,
eight and one, two...

382
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,972
Stop there, please.
Straight away, just slouch over.

383
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,462
Don't make it so upright.

384
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,237
No, no, no, you're not getting it!

385
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,810
Your arms are too flouncy and ballet.

386
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,881
Hands upright. Tight.

387
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,114
You should be able to do that, yeah?

388
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:08,923
What did I say?

389
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,025
Come on.
We don't have time for this.

390
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,934
Oh, how sad.
Crying over a street dance.

391
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,028
Oh, bite it, Chloe.

392
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:29,007
- Listen, I'm sorry if I was a cow back there.
- Carly, it's not you.

393
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,979
Do you know...

394
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:36,642
all my life I've been told to stand up
straight, turn out posture, and now....

395
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,184
Now, they tell me I look wrong.

396
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,690
They say I've grown too tall.

397
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,495
They won't even put me up for
the Royal Ballet auditions.

398
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,066
Come on.

399
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,762
I just... I don't know
where I fit in any more.

400
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,133
Forget them, babes.
You're with us now.

401
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:20,951
I feel bad.

402
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,128
Your students really
put themselves through it.

403
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,829
They're nothing if not hard workers.

404
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,797
But, they really want to do ballet.

405
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,900
Making them do something else?
I don't understand it.

406
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,363
- Have you ever been to a ballet?
- What do you think?

407
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,464
- Would you like to accompany me?
- I don't know. It's not really my scene.

408
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,636
How do you know...
if you've never been?

409
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,477
Maybe she fancies you.

410
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,551
- Get out.
- You never know with them arty-farty types.

411
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,287
Jay's a fool, you know that, right?

412
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,953
He's never going to call, is he?

413
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,565
- Nope.
- Never in a million years.

414
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,767
Thanks.

415
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,970
- You don't need him, anyway.
- It's all about Jay, though.

416
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,938
Stop putting yourself through it.

417
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,601
Tell you what....

418
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,468
- What are you doing?
- You call him.

419
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,946
- Have you dialled?
- It's on speaker. I want to hear.

420
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:16,913
Shawna!

421
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,980
Yeah, this is Jay.
You know what to do.

422
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,477
Jay, it's Carly.

423
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,257
I know it's over with me and the crew
and everything, I just wish you'd of said....

424
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,715
Just wish you'd said,
'you're dumped, muppet'.

425
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,830
Carly's taking us
all the way to the finals

426
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,594
with her new ballet boyfriend...

427
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,068
So, go suck on that
'time out', alright?

428
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,763
You tell him, rude girl.

429
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,167
That part of your life is now over.

430
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,704
It's time for the next phase.

431
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,024
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

432
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,656
Are you some kind of
ballet celebrity?

433
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,127
I used to dance.

434
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,072
- Helena, darling.
- Oh, Michael.

435
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,772
I'm so pleased you could make it.

436
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,804
I wouldn't miss it for the world...
you know that.

437
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,849
Michael, this is Carly.

438
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:29,785
An exciting young choreographer
who is working with my students.

439
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,216
And this is Michael who is
choreographing tonight's ballet.

440
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,257
I'd love to see some of your work.

441
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,188
Oh, we'll see if
that can be arranged.

442
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,661
Well, enjoy the performance.

443
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,561
You're in every scene.

444
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,899
- He's just an old student of mine.
- Oh, yeah.

445
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,902
What did you teach him, exactly?

446
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,081
I got goose bumps, like.

447
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,423
Oh, gosh...
they never even said a word.

448
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,822
But you understood?

449
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,960
Not everything,
but it was powerful.

450
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,254
- I could feel what they were feeling.
- Good.

451
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,933
- Remember that for your routine.
- But, that's ballet.

452
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,638
Think less, 'this is ballet',
'this is street dance'...

453
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,169
...but more, 'this is dance'.

454
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,947
But, we're still entering
a street dance competition.

455
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,609
I mean, it's a different world.

456
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,182
Same world.

457
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,314
You'll have a stage
and an audience.

458
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,013
What do you want them to feel?

459
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,662
- Jay.
- I got your message.

460
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,739
It was Shawna, she's mad at you.

461
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,541
I'm sorry I didn't call you back
the other day.

462
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,065
You said you needed time out.

463
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,010
- I've missed you.
- Really?

464
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,178
Of course.

465
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,308
Look at you, where have you been?
You look amazing.

466
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,283
You wouldn't believe.

467
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,488
Do you want to ask me in?
Tell me about it.

468
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:21,991
Sorry.

469
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,757
It's me who should be apologising.

470
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,927
What will your
ballet boyfriend think?

471
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,962
Probably pirouette you to death,
if he existed.

472
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,037
You know I've been waiting foryou.

473
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,114
- And you're still going for the finals?
- Gonna try.

474
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,680
Are the ballet dancers any good?

475
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,145
Really good.

476
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,387
Problem is trying to get them
to dance like us.

477
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,359
- You know there's still a place for you?
- It sounds like you're managing just fine.

478
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,089
One minute I think
we're doing good...

479
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,697
...then I think of 'The Surge'
and we don't even come close.

480
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,767
- Not everyone can be a winner.
- Well, thanks.

481
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,238
But... you've got to do your best.

482
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,113
Oi! Fred and Ginger,
there is a queue.

483
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,187
Why now? I don't get it.

484
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,626
He said it was a time-out
and he meant it.

485
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:12,364
Besides which...
I'm a sex goddess.

486
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,902
He couldn't stay away.

487
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,064
Oh, yeah... forgot that.

488
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:53,668
Thetone of the warm-up's changed.

489
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:56,109
That's because she had
a late night last night.

490
00:51:57,649 --> 00:51:59,241
Means Jay's back on the scene.

491
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,221
You know what?
We should all go out tonight.

492
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:05,890
Check out some fresh moves.

493
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,226
- Yeah, I'm on that.
- Now you're talking.

494
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:09,693
Yeah, I think so.

495
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,045
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't drink.

496
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:05,447
So, what do you do?

497
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:07,811
I dance.

498
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,548
I can work with that.

499
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,958
Hello, babe.
Do you wanna dance?

500
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,007
Shall we?

501
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:55,088
Oh, yeah, right now you're seeing it
with your own eyes.

502
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,096
Ladies, make way. Make way.

503
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,961
I swear they must get off on
those uniforms.

504
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:05,209
It's the UK National Champs.

505
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,972
It's the Surge, baby.

506
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,969
- Let's get the others.
- The dance floor's open.

507
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:13,342
Anybody feels they want to step up
to the challenge, it's on you.

508
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:16,283
Let's see what you can do.
Let's do this thing.

509
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,455
So, what's the name of the game?

510
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:29,956
It's not a game, it's a battle.
Just throw down some moves.

511
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:31,758
Let's get it popping, let's go!

512
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,321
Do you know what I'm saying?
UK champs, baby.

513
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:03,090
Alright, what we got here?
What we got here?

514
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,730
Are we ready?

515
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:12,171
Alright, then. Let's go.

516
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,492
Did you see that?

517
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:51,105
Ladies?

518
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:56,645
Okay, the ladies are
getting involved now.

519
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,232
Hold it. Hold on.
What is it?

520
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:19,540
There's ballet in the building!

521
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,340
I don't know, man.
It kind of works, too.

522
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,354
I think that's called a pirouette,
or something.

523
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:32,117
I don't know.
But, it's all good.

524
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:37,560
See what Surge can do.

525
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:50,001
Oh, there's your girl.

526
00:56:50,308 --> 00:56:51,468
We're going aerial.

527
00:57:22,073 --> 00:57:24,166


528
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,777
Yeah. What have you got?

529
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,997
I don't know the name of this crew,
but I'm looking for these people, for real!

530
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:54,663
That was cheeky.

531
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:23,425
My God, this is getting
messy man. This is getting crazy.

532
00:58:26,037 --> 00:58:28,130
Hey, all my people,
how are you feeling?

533
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:36,010
Boy, I wish I could lift
my arse up to do that.

534
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:46,288
Make me some noise for that move right there.
I'm not joking with you people.

535
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,093
What you got?

536
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,486
Alright, Surge. It's on you.

537
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,678
Don't touch him...
you're not worth it.

538
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:42,578
You didn't mind touching me
last night, though.

539
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:47,246
Hold it down, hold it down.

540
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:35,088
It's okay.

541
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:05,190
Welcome to my world.

542
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,492
College fees don't leave
a lot left over for fancy apartments.

543
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,055
It does have one redeeming feature.

544
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,191
What?

545
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:52,973
- Close your eyes.
- Don't be silly.

546
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,575
Come on.

547
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,729
Open your eyes.

548
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,507
That's not bad, is it?

549
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,378
It's beautiful.

550
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:42,216
This is where
I do my street dancing.

551
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:45,729
What?

552
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,024
Alright, check this out.

553
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:50,830
Honestly, what? Ready?

554
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,776
Alright, a bit more practice...

555
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,975
but, I tell you,
we'll beat those Surge guys.

556
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:10,783
No, we can't.

557
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,319
Who am I kidding?
They're the best at what they do.

558
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:16,191
So do something different.

559
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,389
What do you mean?

560
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:24,097
You've got five ballet dancers
in your crew... use us.

561
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:27,360
- What, put ballet and street together?
- Yeah, why not?

562
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,540
- It doesn't go.
- How do you know?

563
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:36,945
Come on.

564
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,743
What are you doing?

565
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:43,680
Put me down.

566
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:47,152
- Now look what you've made me do.
- Oh, God. Come on.

567
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:28,077
Can everyone come together please,
I've got something to say.

568
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:36,219
To those of you who know Jay...

569
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:39,088
...he didn't think
we were good enough.

570
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,917
He didn't think we could
beat the Surge, so he joined them.

571
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:46,461
- Low life.
- And to the rest of you....

572
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,657
I've been trying to fit you
into a Surge shaped box...

573
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:52,458
...and I'm sorry,
we're never going to fit.

574
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,308
We're going to do something different.

575
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:06,945
I want us to be ourselves.

576
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,643
Just be our best.

577
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:13,785
Whether that's dancing ballet
or dancing street.

578
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:18,016
We'll mix it all up.
Make something beautiful.

579
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:21,795
And we'll win the competition
because of who we are.

580
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:24,994
So, what we called?

581
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,635
Breaking Point.

582
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:31,535
Letters of concern
from lsabella's mother...

583
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:34,745
from Chloe's very rich and
very generous father...

584
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:38,875
...worried that your street dance experiment
is unsettling their daughter's training.

585
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:41,385
They needed to be unsettled.

586
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:44,554
You are corrupting the discipline
of our best students.

587
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:48,217
I don't like to question your methods,
but this does seem willfully perverse.

588
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,425
Is it a mid life crisis?

589
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:57,194
The street dancers were bouncing off
the walls when they came in here.

590
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,737
Wouldn't you like to see that kind of
exuberance in our students?

591
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,068
Hey, hey. Non.

592
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:04,571
It could transform their performances.

593
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,402
And vandalise the college.

594
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,577
Look, I'm calling time on this Helena.

595
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:12,011
We must focus on getting
them into the best ballet companies.

596
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:14,175
And for that they need fire.

597
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:17,151
Believe me,
we all want the same thing.

598
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:23,117
Carry on,
we're just observing.

599
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,323
Found this class useful, Tomas?

600
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:29,225
It's invaluable, sir.

601
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:31,665
Carly is excellent.

602
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:40,974
Chloe?

603
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:45,070
Dope? I mean, very educational.

604
01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:58,154
Much more joie de vivre,
n'est pas?

605
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:03,990
I think I can see how that might
put some attitude into their attitudes.

606
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,728
Very good.
Please carry on, Helena.

607
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:11,742
But Monsieur, being dopey won't
get them into the Royal Ballet.

608
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:13,073
Enough, Madame.

609
01:10:13,844 --> 01:10:16,608
- Is everything alright?
- Yes, good.

610
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:17,971
Good work.

611
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:21,543
You knew we'd gel eventually,
didn't you?

612
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:23,276
Honestly? No.

613
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:26,916
Sometimes you just have to try things.

614
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:28,361
The Royal Ballet list must be in!

615
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:34,308
- Rebecca!
- That's amazing.

616
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:39,606
What day are the
street dance finals?

617
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:43,987
- Who submitted them for this date?
- Does it matter?

618
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:44,955
It's the Royal Ballet.

619
01:13:44,955 --> 01:13:47,446
The same day as their
street dance performance.

620
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:48,817
Is that an issue?

621
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:52,722
It was Madame Fleurie, wasn't it?

622
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:55,355
We all want the same thing, Helena.

623
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:02,969
Well done, young lady.

624
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:04,605
Helena.

625
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,108
I didn't know, Carly.

626
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,138
So, what you gonna do
about it, then?

627
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:12,310
Unfortunately,
there's not much I can do.

628
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,543
This has been the plan all along,
hasn't it?

629
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,612
Get some mugs in to liven up
your deadweight dancers and then drop them.

630
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:22,257
I didn't plan this.

631
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,661
Carly, there's something you
have to understand.

632
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:29,125
These auditions are their
street dance final.

633
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:30,560
And what about ours?

634
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:35,338
Why did you take me to the ballet and
feed me all that 'this is dance' rubbish,

635
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:37,670
knowing that you'd shaft us
in a second?

636
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:57,550
We know.

637
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:03,127
- They don't have to do their audition.
- Of course they do.

638
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07,137
They've been training
for this their whole lives.

639
01:15:07,137 --> 01:15:08,968
Carly, we can do both.

640
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:11,608
We'll do the auditions and
be there easily by four.

641
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:14,668
- Do you think?
- Yes, definitely.

642
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:18,404
Then go and rehearse.
Be brilliant.

643
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:21,279
We'll brain you
if you don't get in.

644
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,456
We'll be there.

645
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,586
Go on.

646
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,565
What if they don't make it?

647
01:17:11,261 --> 01:17:12,990
Good afternoon, Britain.

648
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,030
Yo. Are we having fun?

649
01:17:18,268 --> 01:17:20,133
Good, good, good.
Having a good time?

650
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,740
There's only two crews left.

651
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:27,107
Next on stage,
reigning champions, The Surge.

652
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,773
We're on next,
but they're not here yet.

653
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:32,711
I knew it.

654
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,151
Why don't we just go on anyway?

655
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,813
- What? Are you stupid?
- Come on, guys.

656
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:41,524
If we start tearing each other apart
again, it's all been for nothing.

657
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:44,118
- You know, she's right.
- Yeah, man. Come on, guys.

658
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,760
If we want to be
with them we have to go now.

659
01:17:58,741 --> 01:17:59,901
Looking good.

660
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:02,710
Your old friend Michael's
on the audition panel.

661
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:28,216
Who liked The Surge?

662
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:33,077
Don't get too happythough, they haven't
won that trip to America just yet.

663
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:34,816
It's time for our last crew.

664
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,885
Breaking Point!

665
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:42,829
Come on, Breaking Point.
Don't be shy.

666
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:54,667
Come on.

667
01:21:57,714 --> 01:21:59,944
On stage now,
or you're disqualified.

668
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:04,915
Buck up, babe.
They'll be here.

669
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:21,966
Okay, must be
an additional item here.

670
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:34,748
Who are you? Who are you?

671
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,199
When did Eddie learn those moves?

672
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:53,666
A bit of old school.

673
01:23:03,713 --> 01:23:04,873
Go on Eddie!

674
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,176
Where are they?

675
01:23:41,918 --> 01:23:43,920
- They've gone.
- Gone? Gone where?

676
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,979
- To their performance.
- What?

677
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:49,258
To that thing... that, that... nothing!

678
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:52,227
No, not that nothing,
Madame, that dance.

679
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:54,554
You have ruined their career.

680
01:23:54,831 --> 01:23:57,061
- What the hell is going on?
- Ask her.

681
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,699
I wash my hand.

682
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:01,263
You start talking.

683
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:07,132
- Michael?
- Helena!

684
01:24:12,415 --> 01:24:14,042
How long is he going to
stay out there?

685
01:24:49,886 --> 01:24:52,150
What is this?
Extreme auditioning?

686
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:01,726
I heard you're ditching, Carly.
Bad luck.

687
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:03,855
Get your hands off me.

688
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,697
Too bad we won't be seeing you
on that winner's podium.

689
01:25:07,904 --> 01:25:09,030
Who cares?

690
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:12,105
We don't need some tacky bit of
metal to prove we're winners.

691
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:15,675
You can say it,
but I know you don't mean it.

692
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:18,506
I feel sorry for you, Jay.

693
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:23,048
A bit part player in someone else's
crew for the sake of winning?

694
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:26,649
I thought you had more ambition.

695
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,024
Can I have the next dance?

696
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:55,215
OK. Breaking Point,
this is your last chance!

697
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:40,458
- What?
- You're not serious?

698
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,558
What is this?

699
01:26:50,406 --> 01:26:51,338
What?

700
01:27:21,037 --> 01:27:22,504
Bruv, we've won this.
