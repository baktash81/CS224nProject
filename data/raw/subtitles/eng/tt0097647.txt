1
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,502
Fear does not
exist in this dojo. Does it?

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,920
No, Sensei!

3
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,965
Pain does not
exist in this dojo. Does it?

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,300
No, Sensei!

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,428
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo. Does it?

6
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,929
No, Sensei!

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,141
Fear does not exist
in this dojo. Does it?

8
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,559
No, Sensei!

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,812
Pain does not exist
in this dojo. Does it?

10
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,272
No, Sensei!

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,901
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo. Does it?

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,444
No, Sensei!

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,112
Prepare!

14
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,742
We do not train to
be merciful here.

15
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,118
Mercy is for the weak.

16
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,413
Here, on the street,
in competition,

17
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,208
a man confronts you,
he's the enemy.

18
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,834
An enemy deserves no mercy.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,337
What is the problem,
Mr. Lawrence?

20
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,467
Class, we have visitors.

21
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,018
I hear you jumped some of
my students last night.

22
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,354
Afraid the facts mixed up.

23
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,064
Now you get
your boy on the mat

24
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,399
or you and I will
have a major problem.

25
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,944
Too much advantage, your dojo.

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,030
Name a place.

27
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,032
Tournament.

28
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,661
Come on, Johnny, kill him!

29
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,917
Point!
Chop! That's two for LaRusso!

30
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,336
Time out, time out.

31
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,380
Go to your sensei.
Turn. Kneel.

32
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,008
Hey, Johnny,
you're a cream-puff!

33
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,302
Sweep the leg.

34
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,807
You have a problem with that?

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,185
No, Sensei.

36
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,605
No mercy.

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,407
Warning for illegal
contact to the knees.

38
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,491
- Ready?
- Finish him.

39
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,702
No mercy! No mercy!

40
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,245
Weigh the fist, Johnny.

41
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,580
Finish him!

42
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,757
Winner!

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,142
Now, who's the loser?

44
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,060
You know,
you're really sick, man.

45
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,688
How does second place feel now?

46
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,690
- Come on, he can't breathe.
- Mind your business.

47
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,025
You're gonna kill him.

48
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,735
Sensei, please.
You're hurting him.

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,778
He's sorry, okay?
He really is.

50
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,781
Oi. Let him go.

51
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,783
Beat it, slope,
or you're next.

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,111
"Mercy is for the weak.

53
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,365
"We do not train
to be merciful here.

54
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,284
"A man face you, he is enemy.

55
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,038
"Enemy deserve no mercy. "

56
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,930
Come, Daniel-san.
Time to go home.

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,516
You could have
killed him, couldn't you?

58
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,934
Hai.

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,143
Why didn't you then?

60
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,687
Because, Daniel-san,

61
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,231
for person with no
forgiveness in heart,

62
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,234
living even worse
punishment than death.

63
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,925
Sensei Kreese,
this is Pat Johnson

64
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,969
from the All Valley Tournament
calling you again.

65
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,013
Look, we're sorry you lost
all your students.

66
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,807
I guess the Cobra Kai
won't be entering the tournament this year.

67
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,852
As you know, we've made
repeated requests for payments of dues

68
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,687
but since you've
failed to respond,

69
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,524
we really have no choice but to drop the
Cobra Kai from our membership rolls.

70
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,068
If you have any questions,
give me a call, huh?

71
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,694
Have a nice day.

72
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,696
Mr. Kreese,
this is Pacific Bell.

73
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,740
This is the final call
regarding your bill,

74
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,575
and if you do not
pay immediately...

75
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,674
Oh, Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?

76
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,176
Where's the boss?

77
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
He's upstairs.

78
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,637
Thanks.

79
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,636
Come on!

80
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,480
You're telegraphing
that wheel kick.

81
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,773
Hey, hey!

82
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,942
Johnny! Johnny, Johnny!

83
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,902
What a surprise, man!

84
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,195
Yes!

85
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,282
What's this? You moving in?

86
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,368
This is "I give up. "
I came to say good-bye.

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,870
Here are the dojo keys.

88
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,163
What are you talking about?

89
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,456
I'll pay you that back rent
as soon as I can.

90
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,665
Screw the rent.

91
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,084
What, you think I bought that place
for the rent? I bought it for you.

92
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,294
- Mr. Silver?
- What?

93
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,920
The plutonium deal.

94
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,299
Johnny, every business
has a slump at one time or another.

95
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,676
Look at this. Ten years ago,
nuclear was the preferred waste.

96
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,596
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.

97
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,724
I'm lucky if I make one deal
a year without being indicted.

98
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,850
Thank you.

99
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,143
Come on, let's get some air.

100
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,562
It's been nine months since I've had a
student walk through my doors.

101
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,481
Hey, you're not
listening to me.

102
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,232
Come on, snap out of it.

103
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,609
I can't.

104
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm broke and
I'm going nowhere.

105
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,072
You're wrong.

106
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,450
You're going to Tahiti.

107
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,576
Now.

108
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,370
All right, all right,
I've heard enough. I've made up my mind.

109
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,207
This slope, what's his name,
Miyagi, and that punk kid...

110
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,791
I'm gonna get them for
what they did to you.

111
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,252
They made you suffer,
so I'm gonna make them suffer.

112
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,921
And suffer and suffer.

113
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,882
And when I think they've suffered
enough, then I start with the pain.

114
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,634
Look Terry,
you don't have to do that.

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,469
Don't have to?
I want to.

116
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,638
It's not over.
We're Cobra Kai.

117
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,599
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.

118
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,935
Say it! Cobra Kai.

119
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,063
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.

120
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,065
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.

121
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,650
Oh, bullshit!
I don't owe you anything?

122
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,193
What about Vietnam, huh?

123
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,111
How many times
did you save my ass?

124
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,948
I don't know. I lost count.

125
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,868
Get the hell out of here.

126
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,624
Have a good trip, Captain.

127
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,509
The White Zone is
for the immediate

128
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,886
loading and unloading
of passengers only.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,138
Ah, smog!

130
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,015
Smells like home,
huh, Mr. Miyagi?

131
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,522
Daniel-san, why mother
not here to meet you?

132
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,691
You tell her
right flight number?

133
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,694
Oh, yeah. I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.

134
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,445
I told her we were
coming in tomorrow.

135
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,155
She loves surprises.

136
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,740
Hope so.

137
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,744
We take taxi, apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.

138
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,999
106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!

139
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,400
What are you two clowns
doing in my cab?

140
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,110
Your cab? We just
came from the airport.

141
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,778
I thought that was
the cab I ordered.

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,988
Mrs. Milo,
what's going on here?

143
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,948
What does it look like?
Progress.

144
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,284
I got a message for
you from your mother.

145
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,037
Didn't I tell you, that bum
would sell the place, huh?

146
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,789
Didn't I tell you you'd be out
of a job one of these days?

147
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,458
- You wouldn't listen to me.
- Hai.

148
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,335
- What's the message?
- What message?

149
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,669
The one from my mother.

150
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,379
She said call her collect
at your Uncle Louie's.

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,425
Nah, nah, nah.
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.

152
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,763
Daniel-san room all finished.

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,307
Yeah, I take good care of him.

154
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,309
You just look out Uncle Louie.

155
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,187
You know, I might be here
for a few months.

156
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,066
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema,
it's no joke, you know.

157
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,486
Are you sure there's no problem
for him to stay with you?

158
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,404
No problem.

159
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,572
Pleasure.

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,282
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.

161
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,161
Welcome. Bye-bye.
Here Daniel-san.

162
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,913
Nice mama.

163
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,123
Yeah, mom. You sure,
you don't need me there?

164
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,251
No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi
and start college.

165
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,505
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man. "

166
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,881
When's registration?

167
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,342
It's this Tuesday.
And classes start Thursday.

168
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,219
And when is Kumiko arriving?

169
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,263
Uh, she's um... She's not.

170
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,768
She got this great job
with a dance company in Tokyo

171
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,312
and I guess she just
couldn't say no, so...

172
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,689
Oh, honey.

173
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,357
You're disappointed, huh?

174
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,361
Yep. But that's life,
I guess. I'll survive.

175
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,114
You'll do more
than just survive.

176
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,616
I gotta go, okay?

177
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,868
Listen, Uncle Louie
says hi, and I love you.

178
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,955
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too. Bye-bye.

179
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,633
The little maple's
still in there. I'll get it.

180
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,760
No. I go.

181
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,720
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?

182
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,726
Hai.

183
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,354
Just remembering.

184
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,154
I'll bet there are a lot
of memories here for you, huh?

185
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,702
So, what are you
going to do now?

186
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,373
Don't know.

187
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,545
Hey, did you ever think about
opening a bonsai store?

188
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,258
Hai, Daniel-san.

189
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,385
In my dream.

190
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,763
My retirement.

191
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,434
Well, what do you call this?

192
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,235
Call "time to go. "

193
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,237
Oi.

194
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,056
You know, I've been thinking
about the bonsai shop idea.

195
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,268
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?

196
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,436
Not too hard, Daniel-san.

197
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,733
If Miyagi have money
for lease, deposit, fix-up.

198
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,904
But since we build house
for Yukie in Okinawa,

199
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,074
money very short supply.

200
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,951
"Supply"?

201
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,537
Supplies are us.

202
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,372
Huh?

203
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,792
Thank you, Daniel-san,
but that not money.

204
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,837
It looks like money.
Smells like money.

205
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,797
Good money. Smell that.

206
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,799
Smell like college education.

207
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,176
I know that, Mr. Miyagi,
but I have a great idea...

208
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,636
Uh-uh-uh.
Daniel-san.

209
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,096
No idea.

210
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,808
Discussion closed.

211
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,561
But what about your dream?

212
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,062
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offense,

213
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,355
but you know, if you miss
the train this time,

214
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,692
there may not be another one
for a long, long time.

215
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,652
Then Miyagi take bus.

216
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,803
Revenge?
Of course you want revenge.

217
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,722
Who wouldn't?
I'm gonna get it for you.

218
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,098
The day you step
off the plane,

219
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,351
you're the biggest dojo
operator in the valley.

220
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,478
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

221
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,606
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100%.

222
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,734
You are back, my man,
bigger and badder than ever.

223
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,527
You're a sweetheart,
that's great!

224
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,988
But what about
those two jerks?

225
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,740
Those two jerks are taking up

226
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,533
100% of my time
from now on.

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,035
So just have patience,
my friend.

228
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,495
I'm just getting
things rolling.

229
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,038
When I'm finished
with that kid,

230
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,749
he'll be begging me
to be his teacher.

231
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,793
And you know what
he's gonna learn from me?

232
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,212
Pain in every part of his body

233
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,714
and fear in every
part of his mind.

234
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,051
And here's the kicker.
He's gonna thank me for it.

235
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,719
What about the old man?

236
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,429
Him I hurt through the kid.

237
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,058
Johnny, by the time that little twerp
steps into the ring to defend his title,

238
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,977
I'm gonna have him
thinking he's invincible.

239
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,231
Then he's gonna find out
what pain and fear really mean.

240
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,441
Right in front
of a thousand people.

241
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,276
How do you know he'll compete?

242
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,571
He'll compete.
Don't worry about it. You just have fun.

243
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,366
Go give Mimona
and her girlfriend a squeeze for me.

244
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,492
How do you know about Mimona?

245
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,244
I know.

246
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,415
Anything else you want?

247
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,458
Yeah.

248
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,920
Make his knuckles bleed.

249
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,465
Hey...

250
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,050
Hey, I like that.

251
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,470
I like that, Johnny!
I'm gonna use that!

252
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,976
Margaret, I'm going to be working full-time
on this from now on. Full time.

253
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,144
Very good, sir.

254
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,771
No, no, no. It's too nice.
I gotta look poor.

255
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,399
This isn't bad.
Fix the collar. Make me look humble.

256
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,859
And about the Borneo call, sir?

257
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,152
All right,
but that's the last one.

258
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,029
For the next few weeks,
my business is strictly revenge.

259
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,239
Everything is in place, sir.

260
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,409
All right, let's see
what you've got for me.

261
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,619
Cute but wrong.

262
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,622
It's got no character.

263
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,499
A truck.

264
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,001
Yeah.

265
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,463
- Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,714
Where are the magazines,
I ordered?

267
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,424
Right here, sir.

268
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,384
Have a very
pleasant evening, sir.

269
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,178
Thank you, Margaret.

270
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,707
"Karate's bad boy.

271
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,667
"Mike Barnes. "

272
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,676
Perfect.

273
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,563
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.

274
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,899
Oh, Daniel-san, just in time.

275
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,026
Hey. How was fishing?

276
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,320
We find out pretty soon.

277
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,323
So, how first day at college?

278
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,825
College?

279
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,827
College...

280
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,373
College is... Well, you know
college, Mr. Miyagi.

281
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,043
It's a place
that I didn't go to today.

282
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,754
What?

283
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,214
Mr. Miyagi,

284
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,883
may all your dreams come true.

285
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,678
What this?

286
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,097
There's only one way
to find out.

287
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,309
All right, I'll tell you.

288
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,519
It's my college diploma.

289
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,646
What?

290
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,398
I'm only joking.

291
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,734
Daniel-san,
you have sense humor.

292
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,654
"Lease. "

293
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,199
For your new bonsai store.
Congratulations.

294
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,661
"One month security,
two month rent. "

295
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,454
Yes. With just
enough left over

296
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,373
for renovations,
if we're careful.

297
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,126
Oh Daniel-san,
thank you very much,

298
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,671
but cannot accept.

299
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,424
But it's your dream,
Mr. Miyagi. Why not?

300
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,261
Because money in pocket
was not for Miyagi dream.

301
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,513
Was for college education.

302
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,474
Yeah, I know, just listen
to me for a minute, okay.

303
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,767
I know me.

304
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,562
Okay, I just can't take
courses to take courses.

305
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,480
You know, I'll get bored
and once that happens,

306
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,608
forget about it. You know,
it's bye-bye college.

307
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,776
Hey I've been going
to school non-stop

308
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,112
since I'm five.
I could use the break.

309
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,781
- I don't know, Daniel-san.
- Yeah, well, I do.

310
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,742
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?

311
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,744
- Come on, just come with me.
- What about fish?

312
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,622
The fish will be fine.
It's not going anyplace. That fish is dead.

313
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,418
What a moment!
What a moment!

314
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,628
You are now crossing over

315
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,671
to the right side
of the tracks.

316
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,215
Oh, what that?

317
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,507
That's
opportunity knocking.

318
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,259
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Right up there.

319
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,594
This is your dream come true,

320
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,054
and there's plenty
of free parking.

321
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,680
It's right here,
right here, Mr. Miyagi.

322
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,474
- This place?
- You bet this place.

323
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,809
Wait till you see it up close.

324
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,483
So, is this the opportunity
of a lifetime or what? Huh?

325
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,985
Now, I know what you're thinking.
You're worried about this area.

326
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,362
But I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,

327
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,113
the landlord says
this neighborhood is up and coming.

328
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,240
I believe her too.

329
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,950
We're in on
the ground floor over here.

330
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,034
Look! Look what we got.

331
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,160
A pottery shop
across the street.

332
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,956
Maybe we could set a deal, you know,
get some planters made up for the bonsai.

333
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,792
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.

334
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,919
This is going to be great.

335
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,465
Hey, come on in.
Come on in.

336
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,010
Mr. Miyagi,

337
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,429
welcome to your dream.

338
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,681
Huh?

339
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,224
Now don't let
this throw you. Okay?

340
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,934
Looks can be deceiving.

341
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,769
We have to think
potential here.

342
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,688
Think potential, all right?

343
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,107
You see all this stuff?
Everything in here?

344
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,775
You own it. Everything.

345
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,695
It's all yours. I mean,
you could use this stuff. This is good wood.

346
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,614
This is good material.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.

347
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,325
And back here, right, I thought
this would be a great spot,

348
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,120
up here, right,
to do like a bonsai display.

349
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,956
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.

350
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,167
I mean, the possibilities
are endless. It's endless.

351
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,294
Here, hold the lease.

352
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,420
Listen, over here, right,

353
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,796
I thought this would
be a great spot

354
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,089
for a little work area.

355
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,259
And over here we could have,
like a bonsai hospital.

356
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,345
You know, the little guys
get sick. Take care of them.

357
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,471
And I work for free.

358
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,265
I thought of a name.
I even thought of a name.

359
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,435
Check it out.
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees. "

360
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,937
Simple, direct, catchy.

361
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,940
I'm telling you, it doesn't look it now,
but this place is a gold mine.

362
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,694
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.

363
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,323
What? What did I do?

364
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,657
Did I forget something?

365
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,242
Hai.

366
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,410
Well, what did I miss?

367
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,747
Your name on lease,
next to mine.

368
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,416
Partner.

369
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,418
Partner? Partner!

370
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,170
Yes! Oh, Mr. Miyagi,
this is gonna be great.

371
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,504
Uh-uh-uh.

372
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,964
Daniel-san.

373
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,098
Arigato.

374
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,893
You're welcome.

375
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,606
What?

376
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,609
Don't bullshit me.

377
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,819
What do you mean
you can't dump it in Borneo?

378
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,030
Who in Borneo knows
what chloride sludge is?

379
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,490
Just do it!

380
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,866
Do it!

381
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,118
Call me when it's dumped.

382
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,244
Where were we, Margaret?

383
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,539
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.

384
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:00,127
"If you proceed, I will sue your
collective asses accordingly. "

385
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,630
"Best to Lorna and the kids.
Sincerely, blah blah blah. "

386
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,257
Yeah?

387
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,135
Oh, good. Bring him in.
What else?

388
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,553
The grand jury.

389
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,764
What do you intend
to do about them?

390
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,015
Bribe them, as usual.

391
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,309
- Mr. Silver...
- Lighten up, Margaret.

392
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,228
Who's the DA on the case?

393
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,646
Mr. Cole.

394
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,897
Oh, good.

395
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,690
Let's invite Willie to dinner
Tuesday night.

396
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,900
And let's make sure
we have his favorite.

397
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,402
What is it?
Uh, poached salmon.

398
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,611
- Very well.
- Mr. Silver?

399
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,573
Well, you must be Mike Barnes.
Welcome to LA.

400
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,742
All right, listen. Thank you
for bringing me down, Mr. Silver.

401
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,828
Milos, call the boys.

402
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,122
This place is intense.

403
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,706
Consider it home.

404
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,958
Thanks.

405
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,168
Snake, Dennis.

406
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,378
Mike Barnes.

407
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,255
Dennis will take
care of your training.

408
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,173
Snake takes care
of everything else.

409
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,591
If you're looking to
be a bad boy in LA,

410
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,468
Snake's the boy to be
bad with. Right, Snake?

411
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,178
You know it.

412
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,890
You get a weekly draw
and a car. Any questions?

413
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,977
Remember on the phone you said
that if I come down here and I beat this, uh...

414
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,271
LaRusso kid in the
All Valley Tournament,

415
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,731
that you'd give me
25% ownership in your new dojos?

416
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,818
- Uh-huh.
- Which I think is more than generous.

417
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,154
But I've been
giving it some thought.

418
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,363
For me to do my absolute best,

419
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,991
which is what I
want to do for you,

420
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,201
I'm afraid I'm gonna need 50%.

421
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,204
Ooh, 50%*?

422
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,500
Well, I don't know
if I can afford more than 35.

423
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,173
I understand.
I guess I'd better get going.

424
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,716
It was nice meeting everybody.

425
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,884
Hey!

426
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,511
Do you fight as
hard as you negotiate?

427
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,596
Harder.

428
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,723
You got your 50%.

429
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,016
And I get that in writing?

430
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,601
By noon today.

431
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,811
Mr. Silver.

432
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,938
You just bought
yourself a champion.

433
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,065
You remember that.

434
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,984
Snake, show him to his room.

435
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,569
Yes, sir. Mike.

436
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,029
See you later, Mike.

437
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,906
Milos, my blue pinstripe.

438
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,952
So, what do you think?

439
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,163
Oh, he's obnoxious.

440
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,791
Yeah, he's perfect.

441
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,631
Ah.
Ah, Daniel-san.

442
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,090
Very good.

443
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,468
This make special bonsai.

444
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,012
- You really see a bonsai in here, huh?
- Hai.

445
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,639
Where?

446
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,848
Inside.

447
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,974
Inside?

448
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,101
Hello, any bonsai in here?

449
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,147
Daniel-san, not inside.
Inside you.

450
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,775
Same place your
karate come from.

451
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,818
But my karate comes from you.

452
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,448
Only root karate
come from Miyagi.

453
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,578
Just like bonsai
choose own way grow

454
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,747
because the root is strong.

455
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,626
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.

456
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,711
Yeah, but I do it your way.

457
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,673
Hai. One day, you do own way.

458
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,765
Remember what
you said before about

459
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,684
bonsai being free to
grow as they choose?

460
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,727
All bonsai aren't
free to choose.

461
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,145
I mean, we tell them
how to grow

462
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,565
by using clippers
and then the wire.

463
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,732
Hai.

464
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,319
But, Daniel-san,
our bonsai not true bonsai.

465
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,447
True bonsai grow wild.
Very rare.

466
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,866
- You ever seen any?
- Hai.

467
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,285
Okinawa.

468
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,703
What about here?

469
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,496
I only know of one.

470
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,499
What did it do, immigrate?

471
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:30,296
With Miyagi. Only thing Miyagi
bring from Okinawa.

472
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,298
Where's the tree now?

473
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,425
There.

474
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,302
Devil's Cauldron.

475
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,848
- Devil's Cauldron?
- Hai.

476
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,101
No can see bonsai from here.

477
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,688
Good place.
Very safe. Nobody bother.

478
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,190
Why did you put it in such
a hard place to get to?

479
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,943
True original bonsai
worth many thousand dollar.

480
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:53,986
Wow!

481
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,448
Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family kata.

482
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,907
Now you ready.

483
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,704
Like all bonsai found in tree,
all karate found in this kata.

484
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,789
Come, together we do kata.

485
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,127
- Hi, Mr. Miyagi.
- Hi.

486
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,461
Hey, I brought over this tree.

487
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,004
You know, the one you were
working on this morning.

488
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,132
I figured you might want
to give it another try.

489
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,299
Oh, thank you.

490
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,386
I thought a change of scenery
might bring what's inside outside, huh.

491
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,554
Where should I put it?

492
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,305
Over here, okay.

493
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,724
Very good, Daniel-san.

494
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,891
You've done a lot of
work here. This place

495
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,643
- is bigger than I thought.
- Yeah.

496
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,478
There's your charcoal.

497
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,980
Thank you.

498
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,149
Oh, perfect.

499
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,151
Listen.

500
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,570
I hope you don't mind
but, um...

501
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,073
I opened that letter.

502
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,243
You know, the one that came today
from the All Valley Tournament.

503
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,495
There's a new rule this year.

504
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,914
Would you like
to read about it?

505
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,166
No.

506
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,210
That's okay because
I got it memorized.

507
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,254
It says,
"Under the new rules,

508
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,591
"the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match. "

509
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,384
Isn't that great?
That's one fight.

510
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,428
That limits my fights
to just one.

511
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,388
That's better than what I
had to put up with last year. Right?

512
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,514
Hai.

513
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,517
And let's face it,
it's another year.

514
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,478
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced, right?

515
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,604
Hai.

516
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,857
So I think we should
seriously reconsider this.

517
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,026
- Right?
- Wrong!

518
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,360
Wrong?

519
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,530
Should consider get
new pot for bonsai.

520
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,073
You know, I don't know
what the big deal is.

521
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,909
- I mean, what is your problem with this?
- Uh-uh-uh.

522
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,245
Daniel-san,

523
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,541
if karate used defend honor,
defend life,

524
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,377
karate means something.

525
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,507
If karate used defend
plastic metal trophy,

526
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,259
karate no mean nothing.

527
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,722
Understand?

528
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,266
I wish I did.

529
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,563
Go find a nice pot for
bonsai across street.

530
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,112
Oh, here's your pen.

531
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,032
Before I forget.

532
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,621
And if you have a minute,

533
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,331
just in case you
change your mind,

534
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,999
here's the application.

535
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,251
Okay?

536
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,839
I mean, It's no rush. I mean,
it says at the bottom...

537
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,341
We have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in.

538
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,717
So, uh...

539
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:49,513
I'm sorry if I made it seem
like we had to do it today.

540
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,183
We have some time.

541
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,867
Hello?

542
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,995
Oh, hi.
Could you turn that off?

543
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,205
- Sure.
- Thanks.

544
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,375
Hang on, I'm almost finished.

545
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,626
That's okay.

546
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,753
It's okay. Take your time.

547
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,673
That's pretty cool.

548
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,966
Thanks.

549
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,218
So, what can I do for you?

550
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,638
Well, actually, I came...
I was looking to buy some pots.

551
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,807
Yeah, what size?

552
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,225
Um...

553
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,397
- This would be good. Like this.
- Yeah.

554
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,607
Yeah, they're
for bonsai trees.

555
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,983
We're opening a shop
across the street.

556
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,151
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

557
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,069
Great. Well, welcome
to the neighborhood.

558
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,362
Thanks.

559
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,656
Yeah, I love bonsai.

560
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,159
They're so perfect, you know?

561
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,829
Maybe when we get our trees in
you could come visit the shop.

562
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,581
And meet my partner, too.

563
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,750
I haven't even
really met you yet.

564
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,585
- I'm sorry, my...
- Oh.

565
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,421
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.

566
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,381
Hi. Is that you?

567
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,508
Well... Yep, that's me.

568
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,970
What happened to the guy
who lost his head?

569
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,056
Elizabeth Anne Rooney
happened to him.

570
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,350
The traitor. So, yeah...

571
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,518
- The pots?
- You know what we could do?

572
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,896
I mean, if you can do it.

573
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,858
Could you put like a bonsai
tree on the side of the pot?

574
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,360
It's sort of
like our trademark.

575
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,653
Okay, like embossed?

576
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,363
Your right. Right on the side.

577
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,697
I'll draw a picture
of it for you.

578
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,950
- That would be great.
- That would be great.

579
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,369
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Okay, listen. I got to

580
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,913
- deal with this guy.
- Okay, I understand.

581
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,123
Well, thanks,
I'll see you soon then.

582
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,084
How soon?

583
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,461
How soon? Well, I don't know.

584
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,214
- Busy tonight?
- No.

585
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,382
No?

586
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,801
Well, then
I'll see you tonight.

587
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,969
I mean, if that's
okay with you?

588
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,720
Okay. About 7:00?

589
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,139
- Well, sure. 7:00 is good.
- Okay.

590
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,433
I just live right upstairs,
so go around the side, okay?

591
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,601
- Okay.
- All right.

592
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,978
I'll see you
around the side, 7:00.

593
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,562
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

594
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,482
Charles is going to
get angry. Open up the gate.

595
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,622
Hey, you found it, huh?

596
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,999
Hai.

597
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,458
Thanks to you.

598
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,961
Thanks to me?
I didn't do anything.

599
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,921
That looks great.

600
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,091
You find something?

601
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,345
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.

602
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,473
You didn't send me over there
just to look at pots, did you?

603
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,809
Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

604
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,105
Did you sign it?
Did you sign it?

605
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,899
You didn't sign it.

606
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,276
No.

607
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,575
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I understand your feelings on this.

608
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,452
I do. But you have to
understand mine.

609
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,662
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.

610
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,832
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?

611
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,793
Daniel-san, you no look
answer Miyagi.

612
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,380
Just like a bonsai
live inside the tree,

613
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,884
answer live inside of you.

614
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,180
Yeah, well, the only thing living inside me
right now is a lot of confusion.

615
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,514
I have the chance
to be the champion again.

616
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,017
All I have to do is
put my signature to it.

617
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,643
Or match to it.

618
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,980
- A match to it?
- Hai.

619
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,234
Then you watch confusion
disappear with the smoke.

620
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,548
"442nd. "

621
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,926
Perfect.

622
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,172
What are you doing here?

623
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,009
- Forget something.
- What?

624
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,637
For shop. Bring good luck.

625
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,349
Well, hopefully it brings
good customers, too.

626
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,768
Daniel-san look good.

627
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,688
Yeah, thanks for the shirt.
I love it, man.

628
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,148
What doing?

629
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,984
Well, I've been thinking
about what you said,

630
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,319
and I decided to
take your advice.

631
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,572
I'm going to let my confusion
go up in smoke.

632
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,241
I'm not entering
the tournament.

633
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,494
I want my karate
and your karate to mean something.

634
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,209
Good decision, Daniel-san.

635
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,838
This way no more bruises.
Save money on bandage.

636
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,882
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.

637
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,885
Just an elbow, a few feet.

638
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,889
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.

639
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,184
I'll see you later,
Mr. Miyagi.

640
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,398
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,899
So, you all set to go?

642
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,818
Uh...

643
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,071
First I gotta tell you this,
um...

644
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,866
See, I have something...

645
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,660
After you hear this,
you just might change your mind.

646
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,079
What do you have, poison oak?

647
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,540
A boyfriend.

648
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,168
You see, he was in
the headless picture.

649
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,961
You know, we broke up
two months ago.

650
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,048
You mean
Elizabeth Anne Rooney...

651
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,592
Yeah, we were both
a little dumb about it,

652
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,845
but you know, we've been
talking on the phone and...

653
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,348
I don't know, we're gonna
give it another try when I go home.

654
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,767
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.

655
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,851
Wow.

656
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,562
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
after Thanksgiving.

657
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,439
I just didn't want to lead
you on or anything.

658
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,941
- No, no.
- I mean, I did come on kind of strong.

659
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,194
No, don't worry about it.
It's refreshing.

660
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,905
- We could go Dutch.
- Okay, that sounds great.

661
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,408
It's just that I've been here
for two months

662
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,118
with absolutely nothing to do

663
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,828
and I haven't
even met any friends.

664
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,538
Well, meet your first friend.

665
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,998
All right.

666
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,084
- Yeah, this is wild.
- What?

667
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,585
Wait till he hears
about this one.

668
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,753
Who?

669
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,880
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
He's uh...

670
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,382
You wanna meet him?
He's right across the street.

671
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,549
- Yeah, why not?
- Oh, great.

672
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,843
You are about to
meet the greatest guy.

673
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,845
This guy,
he's funny, he's smart.

674
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,306
I mean, you got a problem,
he's got the answer.

675
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,682
He's like no one
you'll ever meet.

676
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,060
On top of that, he just
happens to be my best friend.

677
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,520
Why do you call him "mister"?

678
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,230
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi.
- Hey.

679
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,191
Meet Jessica Andrews
from Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.

680
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,693
This is Mr. Miyagi
from Okinawa and Reseda.

681
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,612
- How do you do?
- Hi.

682
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,197
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Yeah.

683
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,698
Wow, very good.

684
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,575
Welcome to the neighborhood.

685
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,743
Thank you very much.

686
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,495
How's it going so far? Good?

687
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,707
I never know retirement
mean such hard work.

688
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,584
You like to see inside shop?

689
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,086
Yeah, I'd love to.

690
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,713
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up Daniel-san.

691
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,965
No, I won't.

692
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,508
Good night. Nice to meet you.

693
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,051
Good night,
nice to meet you, too.

694
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,469
I'll see you later,
Mr. Miyagi.

695
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,221
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

696
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,099
Yeah, you see why
I call him "mister"?

697
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,350
Yeah. He's nice.

698
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,477
Yeah, he's the best.
Come on in.

699
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,146
Oh.

700
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,898
Oh, what's this?

701
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,110
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.

702
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,945
So, what do you think?
It is going to be great, huh?

703
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,865
- Yeah, yeah it is.
- It needs a little work, but you know...

704
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,533
So where'd you meet him?

705
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,118
I met him when
I moved out here.

706
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,995
Then he started teaching me
karate and then from there...

707
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,329
- Karate?
- Yeah.

708
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,373
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.

709
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,585
He doesn't really look like
the karate-teacher type.

710
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,420
He doesn't act like it
too much either.

711
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,005
Half the time,
he teaches me stuff,

712
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,507
- I don't even know what I'm being taught.
- What do you mean?

713
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,260
It's like that vase you were
making this morning, right.

714
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,095
He'll make a whole
karate lesson out of that.

715
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,306
- No. Come on.
- I'm not kidding.

716
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,017
Show me how you
were doing, making that...

717
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,102
You go up and
then you go down.

718
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,395
- Okay, now you do that.
- Okay.

719
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,606
Okay, go up. Right, right.

720
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,233
Now, okay, right,
see just like that. Now go down.

721
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,485
Okay, now do that again.

722
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,736
Go up. I'm a mugger.

723
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,489
I'm gonna grab you,
now grab the back of my head.

724
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,616
- Then pull down and bring your knee up.
- Oh my God.

725
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,367
Room for one more down there?

726
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,660
Hey, what are you doing?
We're not open.

727
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,912
Well, the door was.

728
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,580
No, I meant for business, pal.

729
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,832
I didn't come
here for business.

730
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,542
Came here to talk to you.

731
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,962
We heard you weren't entering
the All Valley this year. Is that true, Daniel?

732
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,049
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?

733
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,425
Yeah, that's true. So what?

734
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,594
So, we'd like you
to reconsider.

735
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,221
Is that why you guys
came down here?

736
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,932
Yeah right, look.
I need your title.

737
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,725
So, then enter
the tournament and go for it.

738
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,228
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.

739
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,813
You don't enter
and that effects my financial future, Daniel.

740
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,690
And I'm not gonna
let that happen. Get it?

741
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,151
Listen, I have nothing to prove, all right.
I have no reason to fight.

742
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,654
Yeah, well, I do. I got some money to
make. Give me the application.

743
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,989
Listen, I said forget about it, all right?
I'm not going to fight...

744
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,783
Sign it!

745
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,705
You sign it, man!

746
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,873
Come on, man! Right now!

747
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,875
Come on, right now.
Let's go, punk!

748
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,295
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!

749
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,547
Yeah, you sleep on it.

750
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,757
You sleep on it.

751
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,883
And you...

752
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,802
You can dream about me.

753
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,679
You slimeball.

754
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,516
Slimeball? That's cute. What?
Your mother teach you that?

755
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,393
Come on, Mike.

756
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,895
You'll have to excuse him.

757
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,273
He's usually
a very mellow guy. I don't know.

758
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,399
Later.

759
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,986
What?
Do you know those creeps?

760
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,654
No.

761
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,490
And I wanna keep it that way.

762
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,338
Again.

763
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,848
Excuse me.

764
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,182
Mr. Miyagi?

765
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,101
Hai.

766
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,729
My name is Terry Silver.

767
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,690
My master is Kim San Jang
of South Korea.

768
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,109
My teacher sends his respects.

769
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,114
John Kreese of
the Cobra Kai dojo

770
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,700
was our school's
number one student.

771
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,036
Word reached us in Korea
only two months ago

772
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,705
about what happened last year
at the tournament.

773
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,290
My teacher sends his apologies

774
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,084
for John Kreese's
dishonorable actions.

775
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,589
Accept apology.

776
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,051
I was sent here to help
John regain balance.

777
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,679
Hope you can be successful.

778
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,016
Unfortunately,
I arrived too late.

779
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,977
I buried John last week.

780
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,773
He's dead? What happened?

781
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,149
His doctor said it
was cardiac arrest,

782
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,984
but I knew John
better than anyone.

783
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,028
Karate was his life.

784
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,238
And after he lost
all his students,

785
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,782
it just broke his heart.

786
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,203
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.

787
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,705
He saved my life in Vietnam.

788
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,084
War does something to a man.

789
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,588
You had to have been there
to know what I mean.

790
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,423
Have been.

791
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,759
Do know.

792
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,095
442nd?

793
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,347
Hai.

794
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,598
Oh, man!

795
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,518
More medals of honor
came out of the 442nd

796
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,269
than all World War ll
put together.

797
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,106
I bet you've been there.

798
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,525
- Is this your student?
- Hai.

799
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,610
- The champion?
- Yes.

800
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,612
Our apologies to you, too.

801
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,200
John had vowed to come
and apologize himself.

802
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,910
He planned...

803
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,792
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
to interrupt your training.

804
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,253
Mr. Silver.

805
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,466
Very sorry to hear
about death of friend.

806
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,635
Yeah, me, too.

807
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,972
Thank you.

808
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,732
- God, that's too bad.
- Hai.

809
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,443
Too bad, Daniel-san.

810
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,279
Come, we continue kata.

811
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,336
- Hello?
- Hi.

812
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,589
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.

813
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,092
I was supposed to have
dinner with my Aunt Pat. She owns the shop.

814
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,511
Anyway, she had to do
some things,

815
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,513
so I got stuck with all this
macaroni and cheese.

816
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,850
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!

817
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,102
I grew up on
macaroni and cheese.

818
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,022
Hey, listen. I never say no
when it comes to macaroni and cheese.

819
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,191
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

820
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,526
I used to eat this
stuff by the ton.

821
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,070
Now, I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.

822
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,197
Okay.

823
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,870
Well, on a scale of
one to ten, I'd give it as...

824
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,040
Eleven.

825
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,334
- Let's eat. I'm starved.
- Okay.

826
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,336
I hope you like this.

827
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,213
I'm not sure if this is
exactly what you wanted,

828
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,547
but ta-da!

829
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,842
- Hey, this came out great.
- Yeah?

830
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,803
Oh, look at the tree.
You got it just right.

831
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,055
- Oh, good.
- Wait till Mr. Miyagi sees it.

832
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,181
Do you think he'll like it?

833
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,808
Like it? He's gonna love it.

834
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,975
- Here.
- Okay.

835
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,143
I have something for you.

836
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,728
For me? What?

837
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,064
What is this?

838
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,776
"The Down Stairs"? What is that?

839
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,362
It's a dance club.
Yeah, it's great. It's got live music.

840
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,782
It's for the night
before you go back home.

841
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,743
I figured it would be a nice
going-away present, so...

842
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,329
Oh, Daniel, that is so sweet.

843
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,085
Hey, come on, guys. This isn't funny
anymore. Come on, turn on the lights.

844
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,838
Hey Danny, I hope you
got some good news for my friend Mike here.

845
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,880
I hope so too, Daniel.

846
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,006
Listen, I told you, all right?

847
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,716
I can't help you out.
Forget about it, all right?

848
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,009
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, come on.

849
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,095
You mean you haven't signed
the application yet.

850
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,556
I'm not signing the application, all
right. I'm not gonna compete.

851
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,558
Please just take your friends
and get out of here.

852
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,268
Hey, Dennis.
He didn't sign it yet.

853
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,400
Hey, hey, come on, guys.

854
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,277
This is getting out of hand
now. Don't you get it?

855
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,653
I'm not signing
the application.

856
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,154
Sure you are.

857
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,949
No, I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.

858
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,617
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!

859
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,579
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!

860
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,414
Come on!

861
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,214
Hey!

862
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,925
Come on, punk! Come on!
Let's see what you've got!

863
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,427
Nice kick. Not bad.

864
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,138
Better. Good,
but not good enough.

865
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,601
Come on, get up!

866
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,353
Why are you being so stubborn?

867
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,064
Don't do that!

868
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,444
I am running out
of patience, LaRusso.

869
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,988
Now sign it and
let's get on with it.

870
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,990
Stop it!

871
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,869
I'll kick your ass!

872
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,454
Just get out of here!

873
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,123
Save it for the tournament!

874
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,291
Nail him!

875
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,751
Mike, come on,
let's get out of here!

876
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:44,837
Come on, old man!

877
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,217
Mike, let's go!

878
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,679
Let's go! You wimp!

879
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,185
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you, man. You hear me.

880
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,312
You're finished!
You're finished!

881
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,189
You can't watch him forever,
Buddha-head.

882
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,618
So, Daniel-san,
time take Jessica home.

883
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,203
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?

884
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,372
Yeah. I just want to lie down.

885
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,221
You know, I can't believe
you're singing.

886
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,389
Forget it.

887
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,353
Feel lucky, Daniel-san.

888
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,480
Lucky?
How could you feel lucky?

889
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,192
Feel lucky. Bonsai tree
not in shop. Safe at home.

890
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,986
That makes us real lucky.

891
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,696
I never felt
luckier in my life.

892
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,407
Ah, Daniel-san,
we can rebuild the shop.

893
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,201
- Cannot rebuild stock.
- Yeah but...

894
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:03,416
We sell a few trees,
fix shoji screen, start over again.

895
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:04,875
- Everything will be okay.
- Yeah, but...

896
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,335
What if those
guys come back again?

897
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,753
What are we going to do then?

898
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,256
If they come back,
what are we going to do?

899
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,050
Just tell me,
what do we do if they come back?

900
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,265
Sing happy song.

901
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,869
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?

902
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,081
They stole them!

903
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,208
They stole them!

904
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,711
I can't believe it.
They stole the trees. Don't they get it?

905
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,629
I'm not going to
sign this thing.

906
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,299
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?
How we... Where are you going?

907
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,634
Get fishing pole.

908
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,094
What?

909
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,972
Sometimes I don't get you.

910
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,390
The shop's wrecked.
We've just been robbed,

911
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,142
and you're
going fishing, huh?

912
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,311
We're flat broke and
you're going fishing.

913
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,896
You're just going
to fluff it off?

914
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,564
Doesn't this even bother you?

915
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,357
Daniel-san,

916
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,109
sometime better be bothered

917
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,153
on full stomach
than empty one.

918
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,656
Ah, great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.

919
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,409
You go fishing. I'm gonna
do something about this.

920
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,744
I'm going to
the police to report it.

921
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,371
Show them the application so
they can arrest these jerks.

922
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,500
This is the '80s, you gotta
do something, Mr. Miyagi.

923
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,919
You can't be so damn passive.

924
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,506
Somebody's gotta do something
about these guys.

925
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,775
And then I bring the tournament
application to the police station.

926
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,777
But as I walk in,
they all start laughing at me.

927
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,446
Then finally
the sergeant said, "Son, we'll look into it. "

928
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,073
- So, we'll see. I hope.
- Yeah.

929
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,744
Well, I still kinda think you should ask
Mr. Miyagi before going after his tree.

930
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,413
He wouldn't think he'd hide it
out in the middle of nowhere

931
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,332
if he wanted people
digging it up, you know?

932
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,917
Look. I don't have a choice.

933
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,211
If Mr. Miyagi doesn't sell this tree
we're looking for,

934
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,171
he loses his business.
He's broke.

935
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,756
His social security
can barely cover

936
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,383
the expenses on his rowboat.

937
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,927
I mean, this tree is like
money in the bank.

938
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,263
Great. So now we're
robbing a bank.

939
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,480
So, how much do you
think this thing is worth?

940
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,232
I checked around.
I found out

941
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,733
- these original bonsai trees...
- Uh-huh.

942
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,068
They start at $10,000.

943
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,736
No, way. Seriously?

944
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,405
See, that's why it's
so important to me.

945
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,906
This one tree can set
Mr. Miyagi up for life.

946
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,201
That's the least
I could do for him.

947
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,120
Wow!

948
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,330
It's a long way down there.

949
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,667
You know
what I think?

950
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,002
What?

951
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,588
I think when
the tide comes in,

952
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,798
the ocean fills up
the bottom down there.

953
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,759
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

954
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,428
Yeah, no kidding.

955
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:06,265
I mean, how are we supposed
to find Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?

956
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,894
Well, he told me he
put it halfway down

957
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,439
the steepest cliff,
where it would catch the first rays of the sun.

958
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,441
Okay, good luck.
We're never gonna find it.

959
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,401
Wait! That's it.
That must be it! I found it!

960
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,986
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, oh God.

961
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,197
It's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my gi.

962
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,823
- Come on, let me see.
- Wait... Oh it's right...

963
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,701
You see that ridge,
where the sun hits the...

964
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,454
Oh, yeah. There it is. It's just
like the one on the pot I made.

965
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,497
Yeah but now how are we going to
get all the way down there?

966
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,625
You leave that to me.
I'll teach you.

967
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,835
Come on.
We gotta go get the ropes.

968
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,672
You sure you
understand everything?

969
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,507
Yeah, I got it.

970
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,511
I feed this through here
and I hold this back here and I pray to God.

971
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:50,434
Okay, whoa. Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

972
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,061
I wanna do this?

973
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,854
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You go it. You'll be fine.

974
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,564
- I'll be...
- Just, uh...

975
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,609
Just remember, the rope is your friend,
okay, and everything will be great.

976
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,986
Friend? This rope's
more than my friend.

977
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,989
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.

978
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,325
Right, rope?
Just you and me, rope.

979
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,161
Oh, God. Wait, wait...
Whoa.

980
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,664
Just lean. Okay,
you got it. Don't worry.

981
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,124
- Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.
- Okay.

982
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,335
Okay. This is almost fun.

983
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,630
I'm coming, okay?
Just keep going.

984
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,675
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.

985
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,759
Thanks.

986
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:27,346
Daniel! Look out!
Oh my gosh! You okay? I'm coming!

987
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,514
All right.

988
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,182
- Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

989
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:33,310
Hold on! Don't move,
I'm coming. Stay there.

990
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,814
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.

991
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:41,026
Put your feet
against the rocks and push out. I got you.

992
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,444
Push out.

993
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,531
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you. Whoa.

994
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,909
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.

995
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,035
To the brake, the brake,

996
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,830
to the brake. Right here. All
right? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

997
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:56,250
You okay? Listen,
I'm so sorry about the rock.

998
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,210
- You sure you're okay?
- No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

999
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,298
God, it's a lot steeper
than it looks from up there, huh?

1000
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,633
Well, you've done this
kinda stuff before, right?

1001
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,844
Yeah, but not
from this high up.

1002
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,263
Oh, great!

1003
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,973
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to go back?

1004
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,934
No, no, I gotta keep going. I gotta do it.
I gotta do it. I don't have a choice.

1005
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,063
Well, just be careful, okay? Watch
your footing, there you go.

1006
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,691
All right. God, you scared me.

1007
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,359
I scared you?

1008
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,612
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.

1009
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,407
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.

1010
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,452
You're right.
I got enough to worry about.

1011
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,788
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

1012
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:35,998
Where's the tree?

1013
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,042
It's right there,
between the two rope, see.

1014
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,627
- Oh yeah.
- Come on.

1015
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,350
- Wow, it's a beautiful tree.
- Yeah, huh?

1016
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,814
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?

1017
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,358
Yeah, no kidding.

1018
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,485
Now, remember how
I told you to lock off.

1019
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,694
Take the rope and you
put it around your butt.

1020
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,779
Oh yeah.

1021
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,198
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?

1022
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,824
There you go. I got it!

1023
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,409
There you go. You got it.

1024
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,454
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.

1025
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,498
All right.

1026
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,963
So he really
planted this here, huh?

1027
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,382
- What? This tree?
- Yeah.

1028
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,801
He brought this
all the way back from Okinawa.

1029
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,764
Yeah but... What if he tells you
to put it back? I mean, what do you...

1030
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,974
No, seriously.
What if he does?

1031
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,936
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.

1032
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,896
That bonsai shop
was his dream come true.

1033
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,773
He's not going to
have me put it back.

1034
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,650
I don't know. I still don't think
we should be doing this.

1035
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,361
Yeah, well. I saw his face
when he lost his job.

1036
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,405
Believe me,
I know what I'm doing.

1037
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,740
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?

1038
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,075
The tree's going to be fine.

1039
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,953
We just have to pack the roots well.
That's the most important thing.

1040
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,914
Believe me, Mr. Miyagi
taught me everything about these trees.

1041
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,457
Here, do you want me to
take this for you?

1042
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,708
No, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

1043
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,586
All I need is a bag
to pack the roots in.

1044
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,297
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on! Hang on! Don't let go!

1045
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,383
Grab the rope!
Are you okay?

1046
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,135
I got it! I got it.

1047
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,178
Oh, my God!
The tree's in the water!

1048
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,721
I gotta get it!
I gotta get it.

1049
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,682
I got to go.

1050
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,434
It's gonna get washed out!

1051
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,227
Come on. Move! Hurry up!

1052
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,604
Get out of the way!

1053
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,565
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!

1054
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,193
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!

1055
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,613
We gotta wash the roots off. Come on!
Come on! The salt water will kill them!

1056
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,823
Is it gonna be okay?

1057
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,283
I don't know. Mr. Miyagi
will know what to do.

1058
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,617
Just let's move it! Move it!

1059
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,119
All right, I got the canteen.
It's ready.

1060
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,497
Come on! Come on! We gotta get out of
here! The tide's coming in!

1061
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,708
Wash the roots off.
Be careful.

1062
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,334
All right, let me have it.

1063
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,128
It's soaked.

1064
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,463
You did good.
Put it right in there.

1065
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,882
All right, little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.

1066
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,842
- Good. No big breaks. We're in good shape.
- I'm really sorry.

1067
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,552
I just should
have tied off better.

1068
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,804
It's not your fault.
Look, it was my idea to...

1069
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,557
The ropes.

1070
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,018
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1071
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,729
Hey, LaRusso! How you doing?

1072
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,856
Heads up, Danny-boy.

1073
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,566
Here's something you forgot.

1074
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,818
How'd they get here?

1075
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,154
Hey, this isn't
a joke anymore.

1076
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,655
Oh, I know!

1077
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,073
So let the ropes down!

1078
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,909
First sign the application.

1079
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,328
Hey, screw you, man!

1080
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,330
See, I think you got it
backwards, buddy-boy.

1081
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,082
I'm not the one
who's screwed here.

1082
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,879
Now I figure, the tide's gonna
come in about 12 minutes.

1083
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,507
Hope you brought a life raft.

1084
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,092
How do we get out of
here without a rope?

1085
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,428
Without a rope, we're dead.

1086
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,597
We're dead.
Yeah, well, this guy's dead.

1087
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,806
You're dead, man.

1088
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,644
You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it. I'll sign it.

1089
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,771
We'll get in the ring
and we'll see who's laughing then, huh?

1090
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,273
We'll see who's smiling then.
You're gonna be dead meat.

1091
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,733
I hate this guy.

1092
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,527
Here. I signed it.

1093
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,863
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!

1094
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,533
All right!
We'll send them down.

1095
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,035
Let them go.

1096
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,915
I never learn.
I never learn, man.

1097
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,543
I should have just signed
the damn thing in the first place.

1098
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,962
I should have signed it
and gotten it over with.

1099
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,880
Hey, come on. You couldn't have
known this was gonna happen.

1100
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,966
Yeah, with this guy,
I should have known.

1101
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,385
I should have
known with that guy.

1102
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,761
I should have just
signed the damn thing

1103
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,471
and gotten over with it.

1104
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,224
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.

1105
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,851
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!

1106
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,813
Come on, pull!

1107
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,498
All right, I got you, I got you.

1108
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,297
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.

1109
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,009
Come on, don't stop.
Keep pulling!

1110
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,094
What are you doing?
Pull us up.

1111
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,345
Keep pulling us up.

1112
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:01,930
Leave him there.
Get the application.

1113
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,557
No, you get the application
when I get up there.

1114
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:04,808
Oh, yeah!

1115
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,605
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1116
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,023
All right, here. Just hold us.

1117
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,275
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.

1118
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,487
Check it out.

1119
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,656
It's cool.

1120
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,116
That's it.

1121
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,785
Hey, don't even think
about backing out, man,

1122
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,787
because then
I'll really be pissed.

1123
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,457
And this, well,
this'll all seem like a happy memory

1124
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,542
compared to
what I'd do to you.

1125
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,544
And what we'd all do to her.

1126
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,171
Now you're talking.

1127
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,465
Hey!

1128
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,342
- Come on! Pull us up!
- Hey, come on.

1129
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,843
What, Tarzan?

1130
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,219
Pull us up!

1131
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,638
What will you give me?

1132
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,264
Hey, I gave you
the application. Come on.

1133
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,058
Yeah, the stakes just went up.

1134
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,476
Give me the tree.

1135
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
- Daniel, don't!
- No!

1136
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,645
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

1137
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,147
All right. All right.

1138
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,400
Just hold us. Don't let go.

1139
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,906
Ahh, here. Now please
be careful with it.

1140
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,949
- I will, I will be.
- Please, be careful.

1141
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,493
What are you gonna do with it?

1142
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,495
I'm gonna plant it down there!

1143
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,537
- No!
- No.

1144
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,622
No, don't, please.

1145
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,166
All right, enough. Give me it.

1146
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,250
You want it?

1147
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,420
Yeah, just don't throw it over.
Be careful with it, please.

1148
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,838
Hey, Daniel,

1149
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,257
make a wish.

1150
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,592
No!

1151
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,901
Mr. Miyagi?

1152
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,280
Daniel-san.

1153
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,617
Oh...
The trunk's split. See?

1154
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,080
I just, uh, I put the roots in
peat moss, but they got salt water on them

1155
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,540
you know, and I washed it off.

1156
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,543
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1157
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,711
I'm sorry.

1158
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,046
I just figured maybe
we could sell it

1159
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,548
so we wouldn't have
to close the shop.

1160
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,426
I didn't want
it to be my fault your dream didn't come true.

1161
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,386
And I know whoever bought it
would take good care of it,

1162
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,054
maybe even better
care than itself, you know.

1163
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,724
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.

1164
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,601
How can someone
take care of it better than where you left it?

1165
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,270
I just didn't mean
for this to happen.

1166
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,646
Hold.

1167
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,648
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

1168
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,650
Miyagi forgive you.

1169
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,986
You do? I'm such an idiot.

1170
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,863
Is it gonna be okay?

1171
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,406
That depends.

1172
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,950
If roots strong, tree survive.

1173
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,077
Uh, where do you want
these bonsai trees?

1174
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,204
Over there on rack, okay.
Thank you.

1175
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,330
Trees?

1176
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,498
Peat moss. Peat moss.

1177
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,293
Trees? What? What did you do?

1178
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,336
- Did you buy these?
- Hai.

1179
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,838
With what?

1180
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,090
Sell truck.

1181
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,342
- You sold the truck?
- Hai.

1182
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,766
Well, why didn't you tell me
that's what you were going to do?

1183
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,976
I wake up this morning,
you gone.

1184
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,103
Damn it! Damn it!

1185
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,980
Why am I so stupid?

1186
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,858
No worry, Daniel-san.

1187
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,695
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.

1188
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,615
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.

1189
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,248
Why?

1190
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,960
Why? Why? Why? I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.

1191
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,378
Because I don't always have
the right answers.

1192
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,297
We were at the bottom and
they were pulling the ropes up

1193
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,715
and I made a decision
on the spot.

1194
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,219
So I made it. It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?

1195
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,970
Understand.

1196
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,722
- You do?
- Hai.

1197
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,267
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.

1198
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,270
I don't stand a chance
against this guy unless you train me.

1199
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,563
Understand.

1200
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,316
Well then,
you'll train me, right?

1201
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,362
Daniel-san,
Miyagi always train you.

1202
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,574
But for tournament, cannot.

1203
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,869
Cannot?

1204
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,081
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?

1205
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,583
Mr. Miyagi, why not?

1206
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,428
You know what
the worst thing was?

1207
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,515
When he told me he
wouldn't train me for the tournament.

1208
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,599
Then I knew I was dead.

1209
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,684
What a drag.

1210
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,103
Oh, great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

1211
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,271
You can't swallow.

1212
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,438
I won't.

1213
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:23,775
Come on, you can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.

1214
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,027
Why? So bonehead can
knock more of it out of me?

1215
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,363
Oh, come on, Daniel,
you gotta have more confidence.

1216
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,198
Remember you are the champion.

1217
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,075
Yeah, I'd like to forget it.

1218
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,952
Hey.

1219
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,453
Hey!

1220
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,706
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah,
Jessica, this is, uh...

1221
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:38,957
- Hi, there.
- Mr., uh...

1222
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,042
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.

1223
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,211
- Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.
- Hi.

1224
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,629
You two training
for the Olympics or something?

1225
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,381
No, uh, just some tournament.

1226
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,508
The one you won last year?
What's it called?

1227
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:49,634
The All Valley.

1228
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,721
Right. Good. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.

1229
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,973
John Kreese told me
you had a lot of heart.

1230
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,267
- Oh, yeah?
- Listen, do you know how to front sweep?

1231
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,144
- Well, uh, not really.
- Learn, learn.

1232
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,396
Most of these tournament guys
are suckers for the front sweep.

1233
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,983
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.

1234
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,986
Yeah, well. I'm kind of training
for this one myself.

1235
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,488
Oh, that's too bad.

1236
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,324
Look, I got a good book
on sweep techniques.

1237
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,159
I'll drop it off
for you sometime, okay?

1238
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,744
- Great.
- All right.

1239
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,371
Nice to meet you, Jessica Andrews.
Take care of our champion, huh?

1240
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,582
- All right, I will. Buh-bye.
- Nice truck.

1241
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,294
- That was a nice offer about the book, huh?
- Yeah.

1242
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,420
Come on, you ready?

1243
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,047
- No, I'm pooped.
- Let's go. Yes.

1244
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,840
All right, here I come.

1245
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,425
Come on. Hurry.

1246
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,760
Okay, I'm running.

1247
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,178
You gotta get some muscles.

1248
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,763
Oh, man.

1249
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,272
Hey, get out of here, man!
I signed it, all right!

1250
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,440
What'd you call the cops for?

1251
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,192
Why'd you steal
the trees for, huh?

1252
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,401
You have no proof.

1253
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,695
Who left the application,
the tooth fairy, huh?

1254
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,031
It's your ass, man!

1255
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,621
There's nothing you've got
that I can't counter.

1256
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,705
Your karate's a joke.

1257
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,165
Let him up, punk!

1258
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,667
Who are you, his mother?

1259
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,751
Maybe.

1260
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,881
Get up! Get up!

1261
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,842
You see this? You see it?

1262
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,889
Get your hand off me.
Get your hand off me!

1263
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,558
I ever see you even
on the same street as this kid,

1264
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,352
I won't be so
charitable with your health.

1265
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,979
You understand?
You understand?

1266
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,146
- Yes!
- All right.

1267
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,233
Get the hell out of here.

1268
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,651
Who is that guy?

1269
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,404
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.

1270
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,114
I was hoping you
woulda killed him.

1271
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,865
No, no. That's not what
karate's about.

1272
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,784
- It's for defense.
- Yeah, yeah, I know, you're right.

1273
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,035
Here's your book.

1274
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,286
I brought that for you.

1275
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,080
Oh, yeah, right,
right, thanks.

1276
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,416
Of course, there's only
so much you can learn from a book.

1277
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,001
You're telling me.

1278
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,337
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.

1279
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:53,216
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.

1280
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:56,761
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.

1281
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,805
Well, what do you mean,
like that?

1282
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,849
I'm not made of glass.
Do it right.

1283
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,935
Better.

1284
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,938
Now a little higher
and at the end twist your hip.

1285
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,065
Keep your hand up.

1286
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,778
Hey, you okay?

1287
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,196
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

1288
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,990
That's good. That's good.

1289
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,867
That's a strong move.

1290
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,952
Look, everyone needs
a teacher, Daniel.

1291
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,746
I'm opening
the Cobra Kai Dojo again.

1292
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,330
It's time to set
things straight.

1293
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:28,501
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.

1294
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,129
Thanks.
I appreciate that, but...

1295
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,590
Listen,
thanks for helping me out.

1296
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,135
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.

1297
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,720
Yeah, I'll see you.

1298
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,308
Hey, thanks again.

1299
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,280
- Hey, Jessica.
- Hey, Daniel.

1300
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,157
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.

1301
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,452
Listen, I have
a favor to ask of you.

1302
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,995
Uh-uh-uh.
Daniel-san,

1303
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,415
look, Jessica make.
Beautiful. You like?

1304
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,334
I stayed up all
night firing them.

1305
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,336
Yeah, yeah, I know. I saw one
the other night. They're great.

1306
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,254
Listen, I have
a favor to ask of you.

1307
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,757
I just want to ask you,
do you know how to sweep?

1308
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,176
Of course.

1309
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,137
Would you mind showing me how?
I'm not asking you to train me.

1310
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,598
I don't want you to train me.
Just this one thing. Just this one thing.

1311
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,434
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.

1312
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,480
That's it. Please, please,
please you gotta do it. Be a pal.

1313
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,941
You wait here.
I be right back.

1314
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,151
Where you going?

1315
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,320
Just wait here.

1316
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:41,533
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi's gonna teach me front sweeps.

1317
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:42,784
I found out from this guy,

1318
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,495
the guys who fight in these tournaments,
they're suckers for front sweeps.

1319
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,747
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...

1320
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:52,502
Daniel-san,
you hold like this. First, left sweep...

1321
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,795
It's no joke, all right?

1322
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,548
You don't want to show me,
you don't show me.

1323
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,384
Just don't make
fun of me, all right?

1324
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,888
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

1325
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,189
Hey.

1326
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,356
Hi, that was great, man.

1327
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,192
- How you doing?
- Good.

1328
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,359
Just trying to
work the rust out.

1329
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,486
Listen, I gave your
offer some thought.

1330
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,197
- And, um...
- And?

1331
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,241
And if it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.

1332
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,702
I mean, you know,
just on a short-term basis.

1333
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:10,705
Oh, trouble, are you kidding?
It'd be an honor.

1334
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,124
How does Mr. Miyagi
feel about it?

1335
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,586
Well, Mr. Miyagi, he, uh...

1336
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,716
He doesn't...
He doesn't need to know about it, if...

1337
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,093
But he knows you're competing?

1338
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,639
Yeah. He knows that.
He just, he doesn't approve.

1339
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,517
Well, everybody has
a right to his opinion.

1340
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:33,645
Look, I won't say anything.

1341
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,146
Thanks.

1342
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:37,315
So, when do you want to start?

1343
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:40,401
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...

1344
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,238
Oh, hey, I got a gi
hanging in the closet. I think it'll fit.

1345
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,822
What do you say
we go right now?

1346
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,658
Now?

1347
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,493
One more.

1348
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:53,414
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.

1349
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,792
You're better than I thought.

1350
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,670
You're ready to move on,
Mr. LaRusso.

1351
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,505
You're ready to move on.

1352
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,132
There are three things
that make a champion.

1353
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:07,637
The three D's.
Desire, devotion and discipline.

1354
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,597
The first two
I can't give you.

1355
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,767
The last one I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

1356
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,686
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?

1357
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,396
Sure, sure.

1358
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,191
The response
you're looking for is, "Yes, sir. "

1359
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,859
Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

1360
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,611
That's okay.
Stand up straight.

1361
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:28,283
Now, over the years I've developed a system
of intensive short-term training

1362
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,368
for situations just like this.

1363
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:32,745
It comes in two parts
and has three rules.

1364
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,205
I call it "Quick Silver. "

1365
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,623
That's good.

1366
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,459
You like that, huh?

1367
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:40,795
Rule Number One.

1368
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,381
A man can't stand,
he can't fight.

1369
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,717
Repeat it.

1370
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,052
A man can't stand,
he can't fight.

1371
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:50,346
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.

1372
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,348
A man can't stand,
he can't fight.

1373
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,684
Good. All right.

1374
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:59,230
Imagine these
two-by-fours are legs. Sweep them.

1375
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,192
What are you...

1376
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,872
That's too low.

1377
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:20,043
Any higher it'd be
like hitting the knee. Right?

1378
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,545
Did you come here
to teach or to be taught?

1379
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,724
We're not sweeping
floors here. Harder.

1380
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,727
Come on, put your
hip into it. That's where the power is.

1381
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:38,811
Right.

1382
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:41,814
That's it. Harder.

1383
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,609
Harder.

1384
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,611
Ow!

1385
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,572
Ow?

1386
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,201
"Ow" is not an acceptable
kiai in this dojo, Mr. LaRusso.

1387
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:56,954
Well isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.

1388
01:12:57,956 --> 01:13:01,250
Extreme situations
require extreme measures.

1389
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,479
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.

1390
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,693
You did good for
your first day.

1391
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,322
Thanks.

1392
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,621
Hey,

1393
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,456
I really appreciate
all your help.

1394
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,582
Thanks again.

1395
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,667
You're welcome.

1396
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,873
Who is it?

1397
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:22,957
Miyagi.

1398
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,626
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, uh...

1399
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:28,379
Why don't you come in?

1400
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,092
Just catching up on
some sit-ups here.

1401
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,387
You know, it's not easy
when you're training yourself.

1402
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,098
Daniel-san,
what happened foot?

1403
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,560
What foot?

1404
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,773
Wow! Look at that!

1405
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,067
I don't know.

1406
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,613
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember. I just...

1407
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,157
What's that?

1408
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,617
You soak foot.

1409
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,494
Be better tomorrow.

1410
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:02,038
Why? You got a new
foot in there for me?

1411
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,874
No. Next best thing.
New foot powder.

1412
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:11,631
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?

1413
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:15,301
Better you don't know.
Give me foot.

1414
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:21,224
Ow! It's hot!

1415
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,391
Hot, hot...

1416
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,937
Good.

1417
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,943
Daniel-san, maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot?

1418
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,653
Then you tell Miyagi.

1419
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:36,072
Tomorrow? No.

1420
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:40,243
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy. Tomorrow is, uh,

1421
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:46,290
tomorrow is a bad day.
I mean, in the morning, I'm supposed to, uh,

1422
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:50,211
in the afternoon, I'm supposed to meet with a
buddy of mine I haven't seen since, uh,

1423
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,464
since we got back,
you know, from Okinawa.

1424
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,471
What am I doing?

1425
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:04,976
What am I doing?

1426
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:39,093
Hope confusion end soon,
Daniel-san.

1427
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,141
Miyagi heart empty
without you.

1428
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,440
The bruise on
your foot is gone.

1429
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,109
That's good.
You're a fast healer.

1430
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,862
All right, let's go.

1431
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,449
That's a nice little move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?

1432
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:02,742
Uh-huh, no.

1433
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:03,951
No, I didn't think so.

1434
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,578
What was the last thing
Mr. Miyagi taught you?

1435
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,330
Uh, we did kata.

1436
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,873
- Kata?
- Yeah.

1437
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:12,752
Kata is good for working up a sweat.
It's not gonna win the tournament.

1438
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:15,004
Come on over here.
Hold the bag.

1439
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:18,174
Rule Number Two
of the "Quick Silver" method.

1440
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:20,885
A man can't breathe,
he can't fight.

1441
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,471
Now,
imagine this is the enemy.

1442
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:26,432
These are his ribs,
behind them his lungs.

1443
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,104
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1444
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,106
Good. You try it.

1445
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,528
No, wait a minute.
Let's do it over here.

1446
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,989
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.

1447
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,574
Lay into him.

1448
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,084
Why do I have to do
this with this thing?

1449
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,629
Because it's a part
of the training.

1450
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,340
Because I'm teaching you
techniques you don't have.

1451
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:02,051
Techniques you need
to win the tournament.

1452
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:05,137
What, do you think
you can rely on that crane crap?

1453
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,765
I did pretty well
with it last time.

1454
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,058
Hey,

1455
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,478
wake up and smell the coffee,
Mr. LaRusso.

1456
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:15,439
Last time
you weren't fighting this.

1457
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,945
You don't get it, do you?

1458
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,909
You want to get beaten because of a little
pain, be my guest. I can't be a part of that.

1459
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,829
I make wimps into winners,
not the other way around.

1460
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,997
Christ, I'm wasting my time.

1461
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,051
- Yeah?
- Miyagi.

1462
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:12,473
Damn it!
Could you come back later?

1463
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,975
Daniel-san, why are you doing
this to yourself?

1464
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,227
Doing what?

1465
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,354
What you doing.

1466
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,397
Because Mr. Miyagi,

1467
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:25,736
extreme situations
require extreme measures, okay?

1468
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,488
Oh, Daniel-san,

1469
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,657
that not sound
like you talking.

1470
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,661
Well, it is me talking, all right?

1471
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,872
Look, I'm sorry if
you don't like it, but I got problems

1472
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,499
and if you're not gonna be
part of the solution,

1473
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,501
just don't give me
a hard time about it, all right?

1474
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,211
Okay? You got it?

1475
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,872
What are you
wasting your time with kata for?

1476
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,708
Didn't I tell you
it's useless in a tournament? Huh?

1477
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,126
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

1478
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,627
Yes, sir.
You're right. I'm sorry.

1479
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,213
All right. Come over here.

1480
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,300
Let's get back to learning
something that can do some real damage.

1481
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,595
Rule Number Three.

1482
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:35,139
A man can't see,
he can't fight.

1483
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,808
If you hit him
square in the nose

1484
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:41,478
he'll be blinded
by his tears and choke on his own blood.

1485
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,230
Here's how it works.

1486
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,817
You wait until your man is
attacking and when he's close enough...

1487
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,154
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.

1488
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,280
That doesn't...

1489
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,865
He ran into your fist,
not your fault, right?

1490
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,408
Right.

1491
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:57,494
He can't continue.
That means you win.

1492
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,248
- You like that, Mr. LaRusso?
- I like that.

1493
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,000
Good. Give it a shot.

1494
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,505
Let's try it over here
on your friend.

1495
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,384
Reverse punch.

1496
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,430
Visualise.

1497
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,891
This isn't a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore.

1498
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,977
This is a living, breathing
fighting machine that wants to detach

1499
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:25,022
your head from
the rest of your body!

1500
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,237
It's blood. So what?

1501
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,742
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.

1502
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,787
Humiliate you.
Stomp you into the ground.

1503
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,330
What are you
going to do about it?

1504
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:43,207
- Going to nail him!
- Then do it.

1505
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,255
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!

1506
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,424
- You nailed him!
- Yeah!

1507
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,718
You're ready! You're ready!

1508
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,261
I'm ready!

1509
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,556
What new teacher?

1510
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,016
The guy who's
been training me.

1511
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:04,103
You met him. Remember the time we went
jogging and he pulled up in the car.

1512
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,854
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know who you are talking about.

1513
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,899
He's teaching me stuff, he's got me
doing stuff I thought I'd never be able to do.

1514
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,609
That's what you said
about Mr. Miyagi.

1515
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,236
Yeah, well.
But this guy's different.

1516
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,529
How do you mean "different"?

1517
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:14,822
I'll show you sometime.

1518
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,365
Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.

1519
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:17,908
All right, let's do it.

1520
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,660
What are you looking at?

1521
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:22,454
What are you doing
looking at other guys like that for?

1522
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,123
I don't play that.

1523
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,125
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...

1524
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,918
What about you?

1525
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,754
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!

1526
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,836
If I don't get
something to drink, I'm gonna die.

1527
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,046
Yeah, tell me about it.
I could drink a horse.

1528
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,505
- Hey, Danny.
- What?

1529
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,007
Mr. Silver,
what are you doing here?

1530
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:16,884
You told me you'd be here,
don't you remember?

1531
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,177
Hold up, sexy lady.

1532
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:19,386
Who's your friend?

1533
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,388
I've been watching you
and you are hot.

1534
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,723
She's with me, man.

1535
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,266
- Says who?
- Says me. Come on.

1536
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,392
Yeah, come on, let's go.

1537
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,186
Hey, bonehead,
I'm taking her home.

1538
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,817
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1539
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,319
What, are you nuts?

1540
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,447
Come on.
We gotta get out of here!

1541
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,990
Up you go.

1542
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,909
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.

1543
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:43,243
Yeah, he sure did.

1544
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,329
Where's that guy
with my money?

1545
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:46,997
Get out of the way!

1546
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:48,916
Come on!

1547
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,086
Oh, man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.

1548
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,338
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!

1549
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:55,964
Listen, I gotta go back in there.

1550
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,758
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta check that guy out.

1551
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:58,967
Danny, come here.

1552
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,762
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.

1553
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:02,971
No, I gotta get out of here.

1554
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:04,098
Where you going?

1555
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:06,850
What's the matter?
You did the right thing. You had no choice.

1556
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,316
Who is it?

1557
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,276
It's me, it's Daniel.

1558
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:23,617
What do you want?

1559
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,369
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

1560
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,704
Just give me a minute.
Come on, please.

1561
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,126
Look, I...

1562
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:36,046
I just want to apologize for what I did
tonight. It shouldn't have happened.

1563
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,841
Yeah, maybe you should tell
that to the guy whose nose you broke.

1564
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,884
I am. I will.

1565
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,887
I just didn't want you leaving
thinking that was me.

1566
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,973
It wasn't you? It wasn't you?

1567
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,183
Then who was it?
Conan the Barbarian?

1568
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,353
Look, Jessica, I've been trying to be
someone I'm not and it just isn't working.

1569
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:54,314
I feel like I'm losing
control of everything.

1570
01:25:54,607 --> 01:25:57,484
The only thing I see you
losing control of is your temper.

1571
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,821
Yeah, well, and your friendship
and Mr. Miyagi's trust.

1572
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,322
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.

1573
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,867
I've totally wrecked
everything with Mr. Miyagi. Everything.

1574
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:08,912
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.

1575
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,790
I don't know what the hell
I'm going to do.

1576
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,092
Come on.

1577
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,179
Nobody's written you off.

1578
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:30,642
Just because I got upset with you, that
doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.

1579
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:35,439
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.

1580
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,024
Let's see how much
faith he has in me

1581
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:38,817
when he hears about
what I did tonight.

1582
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:41,904
I think he should
hear it from you first.

1583
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,198
It's too late. It's too late.
I blew it. It's blown.

1584
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:47,034
You're gonna blow,
unless you do something about it now.

1585
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:49,578
Yeah, I know, you're right.
It's easy to say.

1586
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:52,122
It's just, I don't know
if I could face him.

1587
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,463
You'll do fine.

1588
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,507
You just gotta do it.

1589
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:08,388
Well, I don't know if I can.
I don't know if I can.

1590
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,140
I don't know if I can.

1591
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,771
Listen.

1592
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:19,483
I'm going to miss you.

1593
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,486
Send me
a Christmas card, okay?

1594
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,656
You got a deal.

1595
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,158
- Bye.
- Bye.

1596
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:35,040
Thanks.

1597
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,209
Anytime.

1598
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:43,257
No, I just spent
the last 20 minutes

1599
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,050
telling the other nurse that
I don't know his name.

1600
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,552
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I just need to talk to him.

1601
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:50,555
I need to tell him that I'm sorry,
I gotta tell him that I want to pay for it.

1602
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,433
Just please, let me speak with him.

1603
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:56,228
No, I can't wait
until tomorrow, all right.

1604
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:57,854
I gotta talk to
him now, damn it!

1605
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:03,235
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude... Hello...

1606
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,362
Hello, miss?

1607
01:28:05,905 --> 01:28:07,322
Damn it!

1608
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:10,367
Oi!

1609
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:13,161
Oh, Mr. Miyagi, look at this.

1610
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:16,873
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.

1611
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,459
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite. Everything.

1612
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,129
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.

1613
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:26,049
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.

1614
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,885
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

1615
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,387
Come. Miyagi show you something.

1616
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,098
I feel like the whole damn
world is coming down on me.

1617
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,101
And it's my fault,
It's all my fault. I did it myself.

1618
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:39,646
Everything can heal,
Daniel-san. Just take time.

1619
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,148
Take patience.

1620
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:45,944
God, I'm sorry, Mr. Miyagi. When I started out
I never meant for it to end up the way it did.

1621
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,698
Sometime when take trip,
better know where trip end.

1622
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,200
Otherwise better
just stay home.

1623
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,454
Hey.

1624
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:57,164
Hey, it's budding.

1625
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,833
Hey, look at that,
it's gonna make it, huh?

1626
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,335
Hai.

1627
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,755
Make it because
have strong root.

1628
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,966
Just like you, Daniel-san.

1629
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,303
Inside you have strong root.

1630
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:16,350
No need nothing
except what inside you to grow.

1631
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:20,103
Understand?

1632
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,359
Yeah, I do understand.

1633
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,032
You're right. You're right.

1634
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:35,786
Look, I gotta go.
I'll be right back. I'll just be a little while.

1635
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,120
Where going?

1636
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,081
- You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
- Hai.

1637
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,041
He's the one
who's been helping me train.

1638
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:44,127
He meant well,
but I just want to tell him it's over.

1639
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:46,463
It not wait for tomorrow?

1640
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:49,216
No, I'll feel better
if I get it over with now, okay?

1641
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,051
You like Miyagi come help you?

1642
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:53,887
No, Mr. Miyagi,
I did it myself.

1643
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,389
I'll get out of it
myself, all right?

1644
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,140
I'll just be back in
a little while.

1645
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:15,742
Hello.

1646
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,499
Mr. Silver?

1647
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:32,676
Hello?

1648
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,972
Hello?

1649
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:40,725
Mr. Silver?

1650
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:42,436
Hey.

1651
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,647
- Hi.
- Here you are.

1652
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:47,732
Where'd you go?

1653
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,235
I had to go think
about some things.

1654
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,362
- And...
- And?

1655
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,824
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.

1656
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,910
Look, I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

1657
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:01,288
I mean, you've been great.
I just...

1658
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:05,625
You know, when I hit that guy,
that's just not me.

1659
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,545
I just wanted to come here
and tell you in person

1660
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,590
'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.

1661
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,550
You owe me a lot
more than that, Danny-boy.

1662
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:16,970
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
the lessons were for free, but...

1663
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:19,097
No, no, no.
No. Nothing's for free.

1664
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,683
You are going to defend.

1665
01:31:22,101 --> 01:31:23,602
You're getting in that ring.

1666
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,770
Excuse me, Mr. Silver,

1667
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,689
you can't make me do
something I don't want to do.

1668
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:35,614
Danny, Danny, Danny.

1669
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:40,494
From the moment you met me, I've been
making you do things you didn't want to do.

1670
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:41,953
What are you talking about?

1671
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:44,539
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?

1672
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,583
Let's show him what
I'm talking about.

1673
01:31:49,795 --> 01:31:51,755
I'm what he's talking about,
shithead.

1674
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,051
We have an agenda here,
Daniel, it's really very simple.

1675
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:57,177
You guys are crazy.

1676
01:31:57,261 --> 01:32:00,889
Either you fight one fight on one day,
or you fight everyday for the rest of your life.

1677
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:02,557
- You're sick!
- What's it going to be, Danny boy?

1678
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:05,101
It's gonna be I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?

1679
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,276
Let's show Mr. Kreese
how he's going to get his business back.

1680
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:14,861
I'm not gonna fight,
you can't make me fight.

1681
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,029
You don't have to.

1682
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:17,906
You can just stand there
and let him kick your ass.

1683
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,955
Do the crane, Danny-boy!

1684
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:26,748
You're doing this
to yourself, man.

1685
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:29,459
Yes!

1686
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:33,255
You wanna see some more?

1687
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,381
I wanna see a lot more.

1688
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:36,049
Bring him back.

1689
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,051
You see his face?

1690
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:41,388
See the trail?
I think he peed in his pants!

1691
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:58,655
Well, well, well, look who's here.
The big war hero.

1692
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,660
What are you waiting for?

1693
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:12,836
Party time.

1694
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:19,050
We're old friends.

1695
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:45,285
Come on, little man.

1696
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:47,912
Let's see how good
you really are.

1697
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:32,415
You think this is
the end of it, old man?

1698
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,460
I'm going to open Cobra Kai dojos
all over this valley.

1699
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:37,921
Hell,
I might even teach for free.

1700
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:40,548
From now on when people say
karate around here,

1701
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,884
all they'll mean
is Cobra Kai karate.

1702
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:46,388
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.

1703
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:49,224
Yes, he will. You won't.

1704
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,562
Now will you train me?

1705
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:58,400
Hai.

1706
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,321
Now Miyagi train you.

1707
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,368
Come. Waste time here.

1708
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:52,639
Here, here.
We plant tree here.

1709
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,975
- You take tree.
- All set.

1710
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,561
- Careful.
- I got it, I got it.

1711
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,940
Happy to be home, old fella?
Yeah, I bet, huh?

1712
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,568
Let's get this crummy
plastic bag off you.

1713
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:08,196
Put you back where you belong.

1714
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,157
There you go.

1715
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,243
Nice comfortable spot, huh?

1716
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:14,452
That feel good?

1717
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,079
Good spot, Daniel-san.

1718
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:21,292
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.

1719
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:26,631
Let some of your old
roots soak that up, huh?

1720
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:30,969
Daniel-san,
this bonsai have strong root.

1721
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,137
Same you.

1722
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:36,724
This tree now choose
how it grow.

1723
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,103
So must you choose
how you grow.

1724
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:45,859
Miyagi have
great faith in you.

1725
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:48,903
Understand?

1726
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,118
Hai.

1727
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,599
Come on, Daniel-san.

1728
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,913
See you around, old fella.

1729
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:55,845
Point, Barnes!

1730
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,306
The score is 2-0.

1731
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:00,433
Let's do it up, do it right!

1732
01:39:00,517 --> 01:39:01,809
Ready? Begin!

1733
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:07,273
- Did you teach him that?
- No, no, no, that one's his.

1734
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:11,361
That's a warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.

1735
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:14,197
Fighting positions.
Ready? Begin!

1736
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:18,826
Three points for Barnes.

1737
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,703
Danny-boy's gonna
get murdered up there.

1738
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:21,955
Winner!

1739
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:23,748
Face me. Bow.

1740
01:39:23,832 --> 01:39:25,291
Shake hands.

1741
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:27,835
You're next, LaRusso.
I own your ass.

1742
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,672
While we're waiting
for the challenger to catch his breath...

1743
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:33,257
T- shirts!
Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!

1744
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:35,301
I'd like to thank
a new patron of ours

1745
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:37,387
for the purchase
and donation

1746
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,515
of the permanent home
of the All Valley Championships.

1747
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:44,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of Dyna-tox Industries,

1748
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,312
Mr. Terry Silver.

1749
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:48,231
Yeah, Mr. Silver!

1750
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:53,277
Thank you, John.

1751
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:54,988
Thank you very much.

1752
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:59,993
I've always lived my life by the rule,
"If you get, you give. "

1753
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:04,539
For the last 20 years,
I've gotten from karate.

1754
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:07,458
I've gotten discipline,

1755
01:40:07,543 --> 01:40:10,545
health, self-confidence,

1756
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:12,296
inner peace.

1757
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:15,299
Everything that makes me
what I am today.

1758
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:18,928
And today, it's time
for me to give back.

1759
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:25,685
It's my pleasure to announce
my partnership with the greatest

1760
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:29,897
karate man I have ever known,
Sensei John Kreese.

1761
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,275
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.

1762
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:42,201
Together, we are about to open
a chain of Cobra Kai dojos

1763
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:47,331
where young people can come
and learn the same values I've learned.

1764
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:50,251
Honesty,

1765
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,503
compassion,

1766
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,298
and fair play.

1767
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:59,761
Thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the final match.

1768
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:02,055
Thank you, Mr. Silver.

1769
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:08,644
And thank you again
for your most generous contribution.

1770
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:10,480
Remember the game plan.

1771
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:12,982
First you win a point,
then you lose a point.

1772
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:16,819
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.

1773
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:19,864
Then in sudden death,
you get the point, we win.

1774
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:22,200
I want him to experience pain.

1775
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:24,994
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.

1776
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,665
Representing the Cobra Kai,
the challenger, Mike Barnes.

1777
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:36,964
And in this corner,
someone who needs no introduction,

1778
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:40,468
the defending champion
from the Miyagi dojo,

1779
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,678
Daniel LaRusso.

1780
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:50,686
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

1781
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,405
This match will have
a three-minute time limit.

1782
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,658
The first fighter
to score three points

1783
01:42:03,742 --> 01:42:05,952
will be
designated this year's

1784
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:08,538
All Valley Under-18 Champion.

1785
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:09,914
Fighters to your marks!

1786
01:42:09,998 --> 01:42:11,249
Go out there and get him.

1787
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:13,042
Flatten him out, Mike.
Fight him!

1788
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:15,795
Remember, folks,
the new rule this year

1789
01:42:15,879 --> 01:42:18,548
states that if
there is no winner

1790
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:22,844
at the end of three minutes,
the championship match will go

1791
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,138
into sudden-death overtime.

1792
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:27,557
When it's over,
his mother won't recognize him.

1793
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:28,766
You both know the rules.

1794
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:30,685
Light contact is
allowed to the body,

1795
01:42:30,769 --> 01:42:32,603
and I do mean light,
Mr. Barnes.

1796
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,897
No face contact is allowed.

1797
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:38,609
Any violation of the rules
will result in a penalty point.

1798
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:39,944
On your lines.

1799
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:41,737
Come on, Daniel!

1800
01:42:42,781 --> 01:42:46,617
Face this way, bow.
Face each other, bow.

1801
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:48,452
I said bow.

1802
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:52,123
Fighting positions.
Ready? Begin!

1803
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:59,547
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.

1804
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:00,840
Begin!

1805
01:43:04,803 --> 01:43:06,345
Point, Barnes.

1806
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,472
Score, 1-0.

1807
01:43:08,557 --> 01:43:10,183
Look over at the slope.

1808
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,809
Is that perfect?

1809
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,771
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.

1810
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,273
Begin!

1811
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:25,364
Hey, Danny-boy,
how are the family jewels, huh?

1812
01:43:25,824 --> 01:43:28,659
Get off the mat!
Now! Get off the mat!

1813
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:31,204
Do that again, Barnes,
and you're disqualified.

1814
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:35,750
That illegal groin kick will cost
Barnes his previous point.

1815
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:38,961
Score is now 0-0.

1816
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:41,505
Kick to the groin.
Penalty point.

1817
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,798
Score is nothing-nothing.

1818
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:47,720
Fighting positions.
Ready? Begin!

1819
01:43:57,022 --> 01:43:58,564
That's the one, Mike.

1820
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:01,651
Barnes scores the point.
Reverse punch.

1821
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,152
Go, Daniel!

1822
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:05,613
Come on, Daniel.

1823
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:08,074
Let's go, LaRusso.

1824
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,077
Point Barnes.

1825
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:13,246
Score is 1-0. Ready?

1826
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:15,456
Come on, Mike, you got him.

1827
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:16,999
Begin!

1828
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:20,503
Break, break!

1829
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,463
On your line!

1830
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,467
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.

1831
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:29,679
That illegal punch
will cost Barnes one point.

1832
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,139
The score is again 0-0.

1833
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:34,225
You all right, LaRusso?

1834
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:37,770
Intentional face contact,
penalty point.

1835
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:38,938
Perfect.

1836
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:40,314
Score is nothing-nothing.

1837
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:42,316
Fighting positions.

1838
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:44,235
Ready? Begin!

1839
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:50,491
Now the real pain begins,
Danny-boy.

1840
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:53,577
On your lines.

1841
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,081
That's a warning
for running out of the ring.

1842
01:44:57,165 --> 01:44:58,499
Come on, Barnes!

1843
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:03,379
Fighting positions.
Ready? Begin!

1844
01:45:07,759 --> 01:45:09,969
Break! Break!

1845
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:11,637
On your line.

1846
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:13,139
He'll get up.

1847
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:15,141
He's too dumb not to.

1848
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,644
LaRusso, on your line.

1849
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:21,772
Get up, you pansy-ass!

1850
01:45:24,067 --> 01:45:25,526
No point for kick to the back.

1851
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:27,069
No point scored.

1852
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,196
This is beautiful.
It's beautiful.

1853
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:31,365
Fighting positions.
Ready? Begin!

1854
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:35,786
Break!

1855
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:39,832
What's the matter, sweetheart?
You having trouble breathing?

1856
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:42,001
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!

1857
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:44,879
On your line.

1858
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:46,464
This is more fun
than I thought.

1859
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:49,383
No clean technique
on that exchange,

1860
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:51,177
so no point scored.

1861
01:45:51,845 --> 01:45:54,388
The score remains 0-0.

1862
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:57,600
Ten seconds left in the match.

1863
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,186
Fighting positions.

1864
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,771
Ready? Begin!

1865
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,357
Time!

1866
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:06,400
Break!

1867
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:09,570
There will be
a one-minute rest period,

1868
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:12,490
then the match will continue
with sudden death.

1869
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:14,200
Daniel-san!

1870
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:16,285
Mr. Miyagi, it's over.

1871
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,703
It's over forget about it.

1872
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,538
- No.
- I'm afraid, let's get out of here.

1873
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,374
- I want to go home.
- You can't, you must not.

1874
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,209
Is okay to lose to opponent.

1875
01:46:23,293 --> 01:46:24,960
Must not lose to fear!

1876
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,670
Yeah, well, I'm afraid!

1877
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:30,383
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?

1878
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:33,260
You stay focused.

1879
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,932
Daniel-san,
your best karate is still inside you.

1880
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:40,142
Now time let out!

1881
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:44,814
That's the end of
the rest period.

1882
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,232
Fighters on your lines.

1883
01:46:46,358 --> 01:46:47,775
Come on, get up!

1884
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:50,361
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!

1885
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:52,947
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!

1886
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:55,741
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!

1887
01:46:55,867 --> 01:46:58,327
You suck, LaRusso!
You suck, man!

1888
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,497
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!

1889
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:03,124
You're done, LaRusso.

1890
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:06,001
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.

1891
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:11,674
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!

1892
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,010
Where's your little Jap teacher now, huh?
He's a phony, man.

1893
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,012
He's a fake
and he didn't teach you nothing.

1894
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:19,390
Your karate's shit.
You hear me? Get up!

1895
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:23,853
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

1896
01:47:29,484 --> 01:47:31,193
Fighting positions.

1897
01:47:31,486 --> 01:47:32,695
Ready?

1898
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,030
Begin!

1899
01:47:35,323 --> 01:47:37,575
Mike! Take him out!

1900
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:44,123
Hit him!

1901
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:49,920
Get the point! Get the point!

1902
01:47:50,422 --> 01:47:53,591
Hit him, Mike!
He's hallucinating.

1903
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,476
Winner!

1904
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:08,689
The winner and the first
to ever win two years in a row,

1905
01:48:09,524 --> 01:48:12,735
the grand champion,
Daniel LaRusso.

1906
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:17,656
Mr. Miyagi, forget about it!

1907
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:39,929
We did it! We did it!
