00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,320
If I'm successful, if I can do this,
you and I won't exist.

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,080
Not as we do now.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,519
Max, if you don't do this,
we're gonna die. Everyone will.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,600
Max, you have to do this.
You have to try it.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,399
I'll never see you again.

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,519
- Thank you.
-  For what?

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,119
-  For every kiss, every smile.
- Max, I don't have any regrets.

10
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,920
Max, Max!

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,799


12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000


13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,799
- I'm so confused.
- I'm so depressed.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Wimps.

15
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,799
Max keeps coming to my window
and telling me he wants to be with me again,

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,519
but I know it's...it can never work out.

17
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,519
Isabel, she gave me another one of those "Alex,
you're such a great friend" speeches.

18
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,000
It made me want to puke.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
I have Michael Guerin. He's mine.

20
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,199
You should have seen his face
when he apologized to me.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
His eyes were practically begging me
to take his sorry ass back.

22
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,800
I have so landed him for once and for all
...I think.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,199
Where are you taking us, anyway?

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,000
Mmm. To a place
where all of our questions will finally be answered.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,680
She'll tell us
where our future lies with our hybrid freaks.

26
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,680
She's a prophet.
My mom lives her whole life based on her advice.

27
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,400
And this is a recommendation?

28
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,000
So, Isabel and I will be...

29
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,800
You are a wonderful friend,
her foundation.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
You will never have a carnal relationship...

31
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, come on, Madame Vivian,
there's gotta be something in those leaves...a few

32
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,599
moments of pure lust?  Anything?

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,400
Cokolwiek.

34
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,800
Uh...Story of my life.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
- This boy...very volatile.
- That's good for sex, right?

36
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,599
This relationship will not endure.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Look, lady,

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,400
I am not necessarily looking to tie the knot myself,
but do I at least have a few months?

39
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,400
-  48 hours, tops.
- 48 hours?

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,199
Ok, are they a good 48 hours?

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I've never seen the cards fall like this before.

42
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,520
The boy, he's different.

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,599
Yeah.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,520
He's very important, this boy.

45
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,199
-  A leader.
- Yeah, he has this whole other destiny...

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
...one that doesn't include me.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,080
- No. He chooses love.
- What?

48
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,000
- He chooses you.
- No, no, no, no, see, that's impossible.

49
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,199
The reading is clear.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,080
You marry your true love.
You have happiness.

51
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,800
The card here? Intimacy, sex.
You will not be left wanting.

52
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,520
I, Liz Parker, take Max Evans to be...

53
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,120
- Liz.
- Max?

60
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,000
Liz, I know this is all hard to believe...

61
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,319
Wh-what? You expect me to believe that the...
the granilith is like some sort of time machine?

62
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,399
It wasn't intended to be,
but it does have an enormous amount of power,

63
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,120
and we were able to modify it
to artificially create a tear in time space.

64
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,399
No! No! There is no such thing as time travel, ok...

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,120
.because it is against every rule
of physics, of reality, of everything.

66
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,120
- Look, I realize this is overwhelming.
- No, you're not Max,ok?

67
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,120
You...you're like a shapeshifter.
You are like some other kind of alien,

68
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,120
with, like, the ability to look like Max with
that beard and those...and those grey hairs.

69
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,519
-  Do you really see grey?
-  This isn't funny, ok?

70
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,879
-Hold on.
- No! Let go of me!

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,680
- Liz...Liz, it's me.
- Please, just let go of me.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,399
If I were a shapeshifter,
there's no way I could tell the future.

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,319
In approximately 10 seconds,
I will show up outside your window and begin singing to you...

74
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,800
accompanied by a mariachi band.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A mariachi band. Max wouldn't do anything that cheesy.

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,879
- Well?
- I said approximately.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,319
I spent a week learning the lyrics from Mr.
Delgado at the hardware store.

81
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,879
Wow, that's really embarrassing.

82
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,319
I know...
but I had to do something to get your attention.

83
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,680
You had shut me out

84
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,319
As I threw the flowers up to you,
I remembered you preferred white roses.

85
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,879
Why are you here?

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
I can't tell you too much, Liz

87
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,000
only what you need to know

88
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,600
but 14 years from now, we are taken over by our enemies.

89
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,519
Uh, who's taken over?

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
Everyone.
Earth.

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,399
I need you to help me keep that from happening.
We need to change the future.

92
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,000
What we do here has to be precise and surgical.

93
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
No one can know I'm here,
especially not me

94
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
that is, my younger self.

95
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,680
- Uh, what is it you want to...
- Not now...your dad's coming.

96
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,879
<i>Lizzie?</i>
<i> Lizzie? What the hell is going on out there?</i>

97
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,519
Is that Max again?
Max, is that you again?

98
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
It's 11:00. Tomorrow's a school day...

99
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
Aw, jeez.

100
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,279
- We need to talk.
- Talk?

101
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,519
-Yeah, about our relationship.
- You gotta be joking me.

102
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
Some stupid psychic told me
that the next 48 hours are critical,

103
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,279
so could you just try not to be a bonehead?
Is that, like, a possibility?

104
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,799
No waitresses in the kitchen.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,399
Hey, Mikey G. You got my order yet?

106
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,720
-Yeah, right there.
-  Takeoff Tacos, Plutonium Platter,

107
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,519
and the Greek God salad, light on the feta.

108
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,399
You're such a good boy.

109
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,000
-  She put in that order before I got busy.
- Ok, give it up, Guerin. What's going on with her?

110
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,720
-  Yeah, that's exactly what I want to know.
- Michael.

111
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,000
- I don't trust her.
- Hmm. Neither do I.

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,720
I mean, there's something going on with her.

113
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,720
Another new face in town.
Arrived this summer after the signal went out.

114
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,720
Her picture was in Whitaker's office.

115
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,200
Constantly hanging around me,
always giving me these looks.

116
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,600
- So, do you think she's an alien?
- Or with the government. I don't know.

117
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, I'll tell you what I know, Mikey G.
The slut wants in your pants.

118
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,720
- That might work. Oh, nice.
- What might work, Michael?

119
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
That's private.
Ok, I have some questions.

120
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,799
I understand.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,879
If you need Max to do something different,
why don't you just go to Max directly?

122
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
It's complicated

123
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:06,519
but if a person encounters himself in another time period,
there could be a...a reaction.

124
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,600
A reaction...

125
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,879
I don't entirely understand it myself,

126
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,519
but Serina said...
she's gonna be a friend of yours one day.

127
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,120
It has something to do with quantum mechanics,
but in essence,

128
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,799
Max and I would both be destroyed
if we actually came into contact.

129
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Liz, what's about to happen over the next few days
is critical to the history of this planet.

130
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,879
Things between us are about
to change...grow deeper.

131
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,519
We become inseparable,
and nothing comes between us ever again, until...

132
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
- The...the end of the world?
That's right.

133
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,600
What happened?

134
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,600
The closer that you and I grew,

135
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,720
the worse it got with Tess,
and eventually she left Roswell.

136
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,399
Because of me?

137
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Because of me, and how I treated her.

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,120
And it turned out Tess was critical to our survival.

139
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,000
The four of us - Michael, Isabel, Tess, and I...we made a complete unit.

140
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,279
We all had different gifts, and with one of us missing,
we weren't as strong,

141
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,399
and everything fell apart.

142
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,720
So, um...you want me to
help you and Tess get together?

143
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,600
- Yes.
-  Why don't you just go to Tess?

144
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,720
It's you I trust.

145
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,519
It's you I have faith in,

146
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,120
and because it's not just about getting me close to Tess.

147
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,519
I need you to help me fall out of love with you.

148
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,399
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

149
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
- You handle your machine really good.
- Thanks.

150
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,279
I guess it's time
for another night curled up in my sheets,

151
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,799
-  fondling my remote control.
I guess.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
- Unless, of course,you want to
be my remote control for the night?
I'd better go home.

153
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,279
Too bad
Well...good night.

154
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,200
What the hell.

155
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey!

156
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,519
I thought I told you I didn't want you doing that
bewitched crap in the house.

157
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,399
- Out of my room.
- It's my room!

158
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,799
You...you know what? Just...just forget it.

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
-  I'm sick of this place, and I'm sick of Max Evans.
Don't toy with me.

160
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,879
I never asked to be his mate.

161
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,399
He thinks I'm just gonna wait around
until he comes to terms with his destiny?

162
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,799
Well, I'm not.
He can figure it out on his own.

163
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,200
They all can. You know,
they didn't even know where the pod chamber was until I came along.

164
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,720
I hate this life.

165
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,799
I feel better.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,519
-You look really great when you're pissed.
- Yeah, right.

167
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,000
No, I'm serious. I feel, like,
all this energy coming from you right now.

168
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,879
In order to trim the lamp of wisdom,
we must attend to our bodily needs.

169
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,879
Let me tell you something, Buddha-boy

170
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,279
I got a lamp that needs some serious trimming.

171
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,120
- Hi.
- Well, you here for a reason,

172
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:57,600
...or you just rushed right over
'cause you sensed I might be experiencing some actual joy?

173
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh, uh, actually, I need to talk to Tess.

174
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,799
- We'll finish trimming my lamp later.
- Right. I'll keep my equipment on the ready.

175
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,879
-  Mmm. What's up?
- I thought maybe we could talk.

176
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
About what?

177
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,519
-Look, Tess...um, I know that we got off to a bad start...
- Look, I'm not into bonding.

178
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
-  Well, neither am I, but... I want to help you with Max.
- What?

179
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,279
I know Max, and I think I can help you with him.

180
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
How...how stupid do you think I am?

181
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,279
I don't know what your plan is,
but I know you don't want to help me.

182
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,519
You hate me.

183
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,279
You all do.
Don't you think I know that?

184
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,799
Yeah, I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing this for Max. His future's you.

185
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,200
And you just came to this?

186
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,519
No, no. Look, I came to it that day in the desert
when I walked away from him.

187
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,600
Tess, I...I...I am sick of living like this,

188
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,000
and I'm not gonna be free to move on
unless I get Max to move on.

189
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Look, I don't need your help.

190
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,879
If Max doesn't come around on his own,
he can...he can go to hell for all I care.

191
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,519
Tess...it was really hard for me to come here.

192
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:27,120
You can imagine, and look...I know that it's hard
for you to admit that you need help...but you do.

193
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,200
It's up to you.

194
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,799
- So, how long have you lived in Roswell, anyway?
A few months.

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What brought you here?

196
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,720
I've always been into the whole alien thing,
I guess,

197
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,600
but I have to admit,
the sightseeing has exceeded my expectations.

198
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,120
What now?

199
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,279
- Shower.
- Let's.

200
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,200
- Just you.
- What?

201
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,799
I'm a germ-a-phobe.
A clean girl is a sexy girl.

202
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,720
Ok. Water sports.
I like it.

203
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:21,279
I'll play any game
you want me to, Mikey G.

204
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,879
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Investigating Courtney.

205
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,200
What are you doing here, hound?

206
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,200
- No, I'm investigating Courtney. Get out of here.
-  No, no, no.

207
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,399
I found a picture of you, Max, and Isabel in her locker,
and your face was circled.

208
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,120
- No way.
- Maybe you should put on some tunes, baby.

209
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,279
- Bastard.
- I had to get her out of the room somehow.

210
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,400
Good idea, baby.

211
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,000
- I...I'm gonna retch.
- Ok, I've got the situation under control,

212
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
so get out of here...seriously.

213
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,920
-If you lay one hand on her...
- No one is laying anything on anyone.

214
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,279
By the way, you are an amazing kisser.

215
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,599
You obviously came here for 2 reasons, huh?

216
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,799
Is somebody here?

217
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,599
Um...here.
You left that at work.

218
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,000
remember how I said we had 48 hours?
That was...that was way too optimistic. We're done.

219
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,599
I'm gonna go.

220
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,200
- Good, you got her to wear that top.
- Yeah, so you like that top?

221
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,079
Well, we have to...play every card we have.

222
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,920
Here he comes.

223
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,720
Just don't look at him.Let him come to you.

224
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,000
Show him the book.
Make sure he sees it.

225
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,279
Steinbeck's my favorite author, too.

226
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,200
He sat down.
You got him to sit down with her.

227
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,720
What?

228
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,599
Nothing. It's just...
seeing you at 17 again is

229
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,920
making it all come flooding back to me.
How my stomach used to rumble every time I saw you.

230
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,599
did we get married?

231
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,599
- Liz, you know I can't...
- You...I know, you can't talk about it.

232
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,920
I'm sorry. I know.

233
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,400
We eloped. We were 19.

234
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:15,519
We were 19? Wow, that is so young.
That is too young.

235
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,200
That's what I said,

236
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,279
but you said that Romeo and Juliet were even younger than us,
so we drove to Vegas

237
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,000
Got married at the Elvis chapel.
Congratulations, kids.

238
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
So we didn't have a real wedding.

239
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,279
Oh, we had a great wedding.

240
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,279
You called Maria, Michael, Isabel, and Alex,
and had them meet us halfway.

241
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,279
We spent the whole night singing
and dancing in some dive outside Phoenix,

242
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,720
and at the end of the night,
"I Shall Believe" came on the radio.

243
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,079
I love that song.
I know.

244
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,519
Everyone else was exhausted, but not us.

245
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,920
Oh, we danced...just the two of us.
And ever since then, it's been our song.

246
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,799
If this works...
I'm not gonna have that day

247
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,279
- No, you won't.
- Then what happens to you if we succeed?

248
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,519
I...I mean you. The future version of you?

249
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,400
If we succeed in changing history,
a different version of the future will take place.

250
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,799
All the events that led to
who I am 14 years from now will be different.

251
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,079
The man I am now will cease to exist

252
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,200
Listen,
I...I realize none of this is your fault.

253
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
You just sought me out
because it was your destiny.

254
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,079
Hey, I...I can only imagine
if you thought you'd found the love of your life

255
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,400
and someone comes to tell you
that you're meant to be with someone else.

256
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,720
- Exactly.
- You know, if things change, they change.

257
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,400
If they don't, it's ok, Max.

258
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,000
- I don't think things will change.
- I know, but it takes two,

259
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,920
and if Liz isn't interested...

260
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,720
What do you mean,
"if Liz isn't interested?"

261
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,720
- No, I...I didn't mean...
- You were talking to Liz about this?

262
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,720
N-Not exactly.

263
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,519
Damn.

264
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,400
Get outta here.

265
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
- Max
- Were you watching?

266
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,920
- So, it was all a setup.
-Yeah.

267
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,400
- You tried to get Tess and me together?
- Look, I know...

268
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,920
...that you must hate me right now. I, um...

269
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,720
I felt that...and I know you did, too,

270
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:08,000
and I know you think that...that I need to let you go...
for the sake of Michael, and Isabel, and my race...

271
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,599
so you went to Tess.

272
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,599
But she can't be you.
Tess can never be you.

273
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,400
Max, we have to stop this.

274
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,400
- We have to. I am telling you that we have to.
-Go out with me on Friday.

275
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,799
There's a Gomez concert in Santa Fe.
I have tickets.

276
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No. No, Max.
I can't go out with you ever again.

277
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
Please stop doing this.

278
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,920
I can't.

279
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,799
- You're supposed to be breaking up with him, not kissing him.
You...you kissed me.

280
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,279
I mean...you know, he kissed me.

281
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,200
You're only making me love you more.

282
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,720
I just said no to Gomez.

283
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,000
You said no the last time, too.

284
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,000
- I didn't take no for an answer.
- So we went to the concert.

285
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
No.

286
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,599
The night of Gomez I came to your room.

287
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,599
That's the night that things between us were cemented.

288
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,200
Cemented.

289
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,079
-  So when you say cemented, you...
-  We made love.

290
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,200
- No, no, we...we didn't.
- Liz...

291
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,599
No, I have no intention of making love to you
or...or anyone else

292
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,720
at this particular stage of my life.

293
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,599
-  I beg to differ.
- No

294
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:46,720
Making love to you is the farthest thing from my mind.
I...I don't even have protection.

295
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,400
- I did.
- Oh, that's great.

296
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,079
There you are, Max the Saint,
just walking around with a condom in his back pocket.

297
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,720
I...I...I don't even care
what happened in your reality.

298
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,400
I am not making love to you or anyone
until I am ready,

299
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,519
and I am just not ready

300
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,400
Liz, I am telling you what happened,
and we have to change that. We have to.

301
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,920
And so far, we've failed.

302
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,920
Liz, it's not just Max that's the problem here.
You are.

303
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,599
You are. You are not letting yourself change.

304
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,279
Now you have to do something
...before it's too late.

305
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,799
- Maria.
- Can you just wait outside for a second?

306
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,400
Sure.

307
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,920
- Maria, what's wrong?
- Could you just get out of here?

308
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,920
What happened?

309
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,000
I found this picture of Michael in Courtney's locker
...like some sort of surveillance photo or something.

310
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,920
Oh, my God. Is he all right?

311
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,279
Yeah, he's all right.
Actually, he's terrific.

312
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,799
I was worried about him,
so I went all the way across town to save his ass,

313
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,920
and I get there, and...he's already there,
and so is Courtney...in a towel.

314
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,079
Maria.

315
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,400
- Well, this is a surprise.
- It isn't what you think.

316
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:49,400
No, I can do it.

317
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,720
Can you...um, put a shirt on,
please?

318
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,599
- Thank you.
- Liz...

319
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,599
Don't say anything, ok?

320
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,720
Um, because I...I came in here with this whole speech,

321
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
and once you start talking,
my speech doesn't apply,

322
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,720
and everything gets changed,
and I just want to make sure that I say everything to you,

323
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,000
so just don't say anything.
Just don't say anything.

324
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,519
Ok, I...I just re-read "Romeo and Juliet", and you know,

325
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,519
the first thing that
I realized is that isn't even the title.

326
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,279
It's called "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet".

327
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,799
They die. You know, she's this young girl,
she...she's younger than me, and she dies.

328
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Look, I think the reason why people think that

329
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,200
it's such a romantic play is
they don't know

330
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,279
...what it's like to be put in that position...

331
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,279
but when your life and...and other people's lives
are...are put at risk,

332
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,279
there isn't anything romantic about it.

333
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,599
Max, you can't stop what's happening to you.

334
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,920
I mean, your life will always be dangerous,
but my life, it doesn't have to be.

335
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,400
My life is only in danger
if I am with you.

336
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,920
I...I want to be in love with boys
...normal boys.

337
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,200
I...I want to see my 21st birthday.
I...I want to have a wedding day.

338
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:32,279
I...I...I want to have children
...and I want my children to be safe.

339
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,200
You know, Max, if...if you truly love me,
you'll let me go.

340
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,799
I may love you,
but I...I don't want to die for you.

341
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,920
You just want me to tell you
that it's all gonna work out, right?

342
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,720
No.
I want to hear what you have to say.

343
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,200
Ok. Here's what I think...

344
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:14,720
give Liz up. Leave her alone

345
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,400
All this is leading nowhere.
None of us belong with any of you.

346
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,799
And I'm really sick of
how much it's screwing us up.

347
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I mean, look at us.
We're pathetic.

348
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,079
- What...what's happening?
- This must be it.

349
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,000
What you did must have worked.
I'm leaving.

350
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:55,079
What, so you're just...you're going back to where you came from?
- No. There's nowhere to go back to

351
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
You're not there, are you?

352
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,079
I can't help it.

353
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,279
I love her.

354
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,599
What can I say?

355
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,519
You're hopeless.

356
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,920
It didn't work.
We have to do something else.

357
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,279
-No, I...I can't.
-You have to.

358
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,200
Do you know
how hard it was for me to tell him that

359
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,400
I didn't want to die for him?

360
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:42,400
He's the only reason that I'm alive right now.
You...you've...you gotta come up with another plan.

361
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:51,519
Please go to someone else.
I...I just...I can't do this anymore.

362
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,000
Just 25 minutes before I came here,
I held Michael in my arms

363
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,400
...dead.

364
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,400
Isabel died 2 weeks before that.

365
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,000
Now you have to do this.
You have to find a way.

366
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,400
All of our lives depend on it.

367
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,799
How?

368
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
What can I do
that's gonna make you turn away from me?

369
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,400
I don't know.

370
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,519
- What's wrong?
- nothing.

371
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,200
You look upset, Liz.

372
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,279
I...I just can't talk about it.
Oh, I heard about Michael and Courtney.

373
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What gets me is that
...that Madame Vivian bitch was right.

374
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,400
Granted, Michael is the world's worst boyfriend.
I know that.

375
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,720
You know that.
America knows that.

376
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,599
But when I caught them together...

377
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,079
that look of guilt on his face
...I've never felt so awful, Liz.

378
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,400
Oh, my God

379
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,279
I know. I mean, I guess it's a good thing, you know?
'Cause...when I saw that,

380
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:17,400
I realized there was nothing he could do to make up for it.
I know it's over.

381
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,519
I need your help.

382
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:38,720
-So...we haven't really, uh...talked much lately.
- Yeah! How's it going?

383
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,079
Not bad. I found Buddha.

384
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:44,599
- I don't think this is a good plan.
-What are you talking about?

385
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,079
You really think this is gonna work?
I would never be jealous of Kyle.

386
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,599
Can you turn around?

387
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,720
So that's like meditation, right?
Incense, that sort of thing?

388
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,200
It's really about approaching life
through a spiritual place

389
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
and becoming in tune with different planes of existence.

390
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,720
What a line of crap.

391
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,920
- Am I taking my boxers off?
- No. Undergarments stay on.

392
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,519
Right.

393
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,519
- If he tries anything...
- I've got it under control.

394
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
Please stay out of earshot.

395
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
- This brings back memories.
- Kyle, we were never in bed together.

396
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,720
What? No. I'm talking about the towel.

397
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,400
-The "Y" pool, summer before last?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,920
Liz...

399
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:53,400
...I, uh...I want you to know that,
uh...uh...I meditated on this entire situation, and I'm, uh...I'm at peace with it.

400
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,000
that's great.

401
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,799
-So shall we hop in?
-Yeah. Um, Kyle, look...I just wanna...

402
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,799
..make sure that I...I...I made it actually clear
that we're not gonna...

403
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,079
- Consummate. I understand.
- Right. And when we kiss...

404
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,279
-No tongue. I'm on board.
- Yeah. Ok.

405
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm here to help.
My body's merely a vessel.

406
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,920
- What's up?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

407
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:50,799
Well, I was kinda watching the game,
so if you got something on your mind...

408
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,400
Do you have any idea
what you've done to Maria?

409
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,079
- Dude, it was a misunderstanding.
- Look. I don't care that you've got

410
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,799
.. 30 pounds on me or ...
or that you can kill me with some...some

411
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
twisted alien power.

412
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,200
I will not let you treat her like that.

413
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,079
I...I don't care
that Isabel treats me like crap,

414
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,599
but no one does that to Maria,

415
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,320
all right?
She's not just some girl!

416
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:14,400
-You gotta believe me...I have nothing...
Knock knock.

417
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,079
You realize you just risked your life?

418
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah.

419
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,599
- You're a really good friend, man.
Call me that again,

420
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,599
...and I'll really kick your ass.

421
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,800
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

422
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,320
You're a skin? Stop!

423
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,800
So Evans must have really pissed you off
to get you to resort to something like this.

424
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,199
I told you
I don't really want to talk about why I'm doing this.

425
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,679
Jeez, I just figured
since I'm giving you my last shred of dignity...

426
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,000
I...I really. I can't.

427
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:32,519
- So...we have something in common.
- Yeah? What's that?

428
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,199
We, uh...we're the only two people I know of

429
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,199
who have died and were brought back by an alien.

430
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,920
- Yeah. You're right.
- You feel different?

431
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,800
yeah

432
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,079
Kyle,

433
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:02,079
- when he healed you, um...did...did you see things?
- See things?

434
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,599
- Flashes. Images
-NO

435
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,320
No. But since he healed me,
I keep getting these flashes of Max Evans naked.

436
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,320
Feels good to make you laugh again.

437
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:23,599
It feels like this is the first time we've talked
...since...

438
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,079
Feels good to do that again.

439
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,599
Yeah. It does feel good

440
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,519
Well, I guess it worked.

441
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,599
- Are you ok?
-No

442
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,519
- Can I sit down?
- sure.

443
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,519
I've fought a thousand battles
...but watching you do that

444
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,320
was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

445
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,519
The look on his face...on your face.

446
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,599
Maybe it's for the best.
For you, too.

447
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,400
What are you talking about?

448
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,000
saw you with Kyle.

449
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,400
He's turning out to be a...a great guy.

450
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,079
Maybe it would be better for you to be with a human.

451
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't you realize what you are to me...
and you're always gonna be?

452
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,000
You're the love of my life.

453
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,199
Everyone else is gonna be second best.
There'll never be another you.

454
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,519
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-No.

455
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,920
Do you want me to leave?

456
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,679
No

457
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,400
So Max and...Tess are going to be together now.

458
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,079
I don't know.
I don't know anything now.

459
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,800
This is a different world.

460
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm gonna be alone.

461
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,079
Maybe. Maybe not.

462
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,079
From now on,
the future is to be determined.

463
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,400
It's what've always said to you, Liz.
We create our own destiny.

464
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,599
Could you dance with me?

465
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,920
What?

466
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,920
I wanna have my wedding dance.
