00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,583
[Singing]
It's a devil wind that blows ...

2
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:31,220
... when you have a hole
in your coat.

3
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:35,061
And December snow is ugly ...

4
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:37,908
... when your boots have come apart.

5
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:42,064
And you can't see a bright tomorrow ...

6
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,620
... through the darkness of today.

7
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,620
And the country isn't pretty
when you're hungry.

8
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:01,743
The trail is long and empty ...

9
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:04,576
when a gunfight's just been won.

10
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:08,187
And another may be waiting ...

11
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,975
... beyond the morning sun.

12
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:14,541
But somewhere there's someplace ...

13
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,016
... a place where I belong ...

14
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:19,740
.. somewhere a man
don't need a gun ...

15
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:21,896
... to tell him right from wrong.

16
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,904
And it's a devil wind that blows...

17
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,498
... when there's a hole
in your coat.

18
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,054
And December snow is ugly...

19
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,380
... when your boots have come apart.

20
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:37,057
And you can't see a bright tomorrow ...

21
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:39,419
... through the darkness of today.

22
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:42,058
And the country isn't pretty ...

23
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:43,895
... when you're hungry.

24
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:54,019
It's a devil wind that blows ...

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,578
... when there's a hole in your coat.

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,693
And December snow is ugly ...

27
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,289
... when your boots have come apart.

28
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,531
And you can't see a bright tomorrow ...

29
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:18,292
... through the darkness of today.

30
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,925
And the country isn't pretty ...

31
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:27,729
... when you're hungry.

32
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:04,400
Whoa! Whoa, boy. Whoa.

33
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,526
Whoa, boy.

34
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,521
I'm going to have to cut
your leg a little bit.

35
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:22,125
Otherwise you don't stand
a chance, you know.

36
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:23,877
Just take it easy.

37
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:25,844
Take it easy.

38
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,723
Whoa, whoa, boy.

39
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:04,439
I'm sorry, Will. No breeze comes
through any of the other windows.

40
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,634
Why ain't Bud in school?

41
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:51,314
School's finished for the summer.

42
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,629
He's helping Alvarez to put up
bullfight posters.

43
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:03,471
Why doesn't he just play
like other kids?

44
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,863
No body made him, Will.
He wants to do it.

45
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,630
He gets a penny for
every five he does.

46
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,464
We don't need
Alvarez's pennys.

47
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:21,265
Next thing, folks will be expecting
me to send you back working for him.

48
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:27,787
You ain't sending me or keeping me
anywhere I don't want to be.

49
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,579
You ever going to know that?

50
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,783
Well, I got to get some sleep.

51
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,986
Hey, stranger coming

52
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,655
Afternoon, horse come up wrong?

53
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,856
Are we still going to
that barbecue on Sunday? Hmm?

54
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:38,856
There's going to be a hayride
on Sunday. [Chuckles]

55
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,177
Isn't that the way
Bud came to the world?

56
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,335
Huh?
-You remember. That hayride
at the Crosby's ...

57
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,208
...just after we was married.

58
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,577
That was no hayride.

59
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:56,298
Just the two of us
in my Pa's rig. [Chuckles]

60
00:06:57,118 --> 00:07:00,490
Well I guess there's times when
a man can't tell the difference
between grass and hay. Huh?

61
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:07,730
Cutting might have helped.

62
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:10,766
I sucked some of the poison out of it.

63
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:12,935
No question he's been sickened.

64
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,855
Think you can take care
of him for me?

65
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,770
Keep him clean and fed.
Dollar a day suit ya?

66
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:21,211
Yes.

67
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:33,524
Who is he? What'd he say?

68
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,282
Might be something says that
we're using his blanket roll here.

69
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,643
Go on, you get back to work.

70
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:52,883
Say, do you reckon that he means to take the bank?

71
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,485
Go on.

72
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,927
He ain't going to leave his horse here and
then wander over and take no bank.

73
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,718
Well, who is he?

74
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,164
I do not know his name,
but he's gun fighter alright.

75
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,767
Do you think I haven't learned
to smell gunfighter in my time?

76
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,000
He's sure enough smelling alright.

77
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,679
Come to ah...

78
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:20,878
... a hundred and seventy-seven dollars ...

79
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,604
... and twenty cents.

80
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:28,197
I'm sorry, that's all it weighs out to.

81
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:31,878
Alright, give me the money.

82
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,113
I need your name.

83
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:42,876
It's a bank rule. Have to keep a record
in case of claim jumping, things like that.

84
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:44,999
It's a bank rule!

85
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,436
Abel Cross.

86
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:54,481
Abe Cross, why sure!

87
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:58,755
Well, I'd have known him right off,
except for all that hair and dirt.

88
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,272
I heard a Sante Fe posse
strung him up years ago.

89
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,512
Might be they did, but he come
out of it some way, kind he is.

90
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,115
Say you know, a fella
told me about Cross ...

91
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,349
... facing down Bill Bonney one time.

92
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,954
And you know they didn't
come much faster than him.

93
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,556
Ringo was faster and
Will Tenneray took him!

94
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:19,956
Well, Will don't like the story told.

95
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,955
But that don't mean it ain't true.

96
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,274
He's coming out of the bank.

97
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,073
Pa.

98
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:40,310
What kind of a way is that
to come busting into a house?

99
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:41,305
What is it, Bud?

100
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,428
Abe Cross is in town.

101
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:52,746
Look, what do you mean,
he's in town?

102
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:55,189
Who says so?

103
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,703
He does. I heard it myself.

104
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:03,025
Abe Cross is the fastest man
with a gun there ever was.

105
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,589
Well, that's been said
about lots of fellows...

106
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,347
...most of them dead now.

107
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,388
Toby Leach says you was faster.

108
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,550
Toby Leach is a fool.
Here

109
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,942
Ain't it true, Pa?
-That's enough. Hear?

110
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,145
Now you go down to Swanson's and
fetch me a spool of black thread.

111
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,584
Oh, Ma!
-Never mind. Just git, git.

112
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,747
Damn!
-What did you say?

113
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,105
Nothing!

114
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:51,984
Will.
-Huh?

115
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,378
Do you know him?
I mean personal.

116
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,219
Never met

117
00:10:58,144 --> 00:10:59,020
Never even seen him

118
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:03,694
Well, he likely heard of you.
Same you of him, hmm?

119
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,057
Well, likely

120
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,892
Why you taking your old gun?

121
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,210
It's more comfortable. That's all.

122
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:54,609
It comes to three dollars,
forty cents, Mrs. Grey

123
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,606
We have larger sizes, my friend.

124
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,374
Size is alright.

125
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,568
It's my hair that don't fit.

126
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:10,373
You'll have to excuse me.

127
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:16,131
The way folks have been acting lately,
I must be smelling kind of ripe.

128
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:22,249
Hello, Tom.

129
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:24,922
How you going?

130
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,803
Everything alright?
-Yes, of course.

131
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:32,480
You must be Abe Cross.

132
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,926
That's right.

133
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,726
How much?

134
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,166
Nine dollars, fifty cents

135
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:47,761
I'm Tom Cater,
Deputy U.S. Marshal
for this town.

136
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,203
I was wondering, Mr. Cross,
how long you be staying?

137
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,717
Now why's that matter?

138
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:57,086
Just the ordinary doing my job,
do you understand?
-No, I don't, Deputy.

139
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,886
My horse is laid up sick at your Smithys...

140
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,878
...and I can't travel until he can.

141
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:08,916
Thank you

142
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,402
You been told Will Tenneray's here?

143
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:16,723
Well, I guess you ain't.

144
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:19,400
I see you know who he is.

145
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,400
I know who he was.

146
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:24,912
What do you mean he's here?

147
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,119
He lives here, with his wife and son.

148
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:29,681
Works at the Riata Palace Saloon.

149
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:33,553
Does he know that Mr. Cross is here?

150
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:35,670
He must by now.

151
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,394
Tenneray's been here
almost a year now...

152
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,236
...living peaceful.

153
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,394
Well now, that's just fine with me.

154
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:48,991
I got no reason to break
your peace either...

155
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,590
...and I don't want any.

156
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,307
Alright, alright.

157
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:12,902
Cut it off a minute.

158
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:15,701
I'm glad you got it right.

159
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,424
Why's that?

160
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:18,737
'cause you're busy.

161
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:24,583
Listen, even if Cross don't show,
folks are going to be thinking he will.

162
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:26,901
Shouldn't they have a good seat?

163
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:31,705
I'm sure they will, but you and Cross
in the same place at the same time?

164
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:33,744
Could be a lot of watching and waiting.

165
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,381
You know maybe they'll get
thirsty watching and waiting.

166
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:39,100
Seems like a good time
to push you for a raise.

167
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:44,903
I wouldn't argue it wouldn't be worth
say uh ten extra dollars to me.

168
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,903
Would you argue twenty?
-No, Will.

169
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:48,900
Twenty.

170
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:51,577
Sure, twenty...

171
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,339
...for the time that Cross
is here in town.

172
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,891
I never met the man, and it seems
already that I'm obliged to him.

173
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:00,012
Hey, Will.

174
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:08,052
If it ever comes to it,
do you think you could take Cross?

175
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,973
It won't come to it.
-Yeah, but if it did?

176
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,656
I don't care what you say
Cross do in Amarillo.

177
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,936
I got five dollars gold
that says that Will Tenneray...

178
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,454
...can stop any man
who throws down a guinea.

179
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:25,015
Can anybody here cover that?

180
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:27,567
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
am I drinking alone?

181
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:36,851
How about thirty?

182
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:55,563
Mr. Cross?

183
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:58,329
I'm Newt Hale.

184
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,202
I guess you don't remember me.

185
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,685
I was drubbing harness in Virginia City
one time when you was there.

186
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,086
I'm in business here now.

187
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,327
Mr. Cross, I wanted to ask you...

188
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:16,000
...I mean, I hope you don't take
it wrong, my asking, but...

189
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:19,050
...are you really going against
Will Tenneray like they're saying?

190
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,246
I've never been a
betting man, Mr. Cross,...

191
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,329
...and less so now that I
have a wife and three kids.

192
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,006
But I am a businessman in this town,...

193
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:32,678
...and if this fast talk is just talk

194
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,920
Well, if this don't happen...
-Yeah

195
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,807
...and you ride out,
then all bets are off, you see.

196
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:40,886
Bets are off, but not forgotten.

197
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:45,122
It sure wouldn't hurt
my business none if it got out
that I was backing Tenneray.

198
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,245
It seems that he is the local favorite.

199
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:49,320
He's going to go on living here too.

200
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:57,479
You go ahead and place your bet.
-Thank you, Mr. Cross.

201
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,079
I want you to know.
Thank you, Mr. Cross.

202
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,357
Hey, shut up a minute!

203
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:53,194
Did you say that you were
looking for Will Tenneray?

204
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:55,273
That's right.

205
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:05,191
I'm Will Tenneray.

206
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:06,866
Abe Cross.

207
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:19,143
Nice meeting you

208
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:23,869
My pleasure

209
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:38,108
Listen, I'm sure Mr. Cross
and Mr. Tenneray...

210
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,262
...don't want anybody crowding
their backs. Huh?

211
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,781
I'll get your bets down here
at the end of the bar.

212
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,306
Gentlemen, this one is on me.

213
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,658
Take it easy, die sooner.
-Why's that?

214
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,218
Talk and all.

215
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,423
Whisky not to your liking?
-It's alright.

216
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:12,304
I guess my belly
ain't what it was.
-That so?

217
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,740
Yeah
-Bother you to eat?

218
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:14,782
Sometimes

219
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:16,302
Eating Mexican

220
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:18,977
That where you
got the dust, Mexico?

221
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:22,782
Heard you traded
some at the bank

222
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:25,259
Then you heard that it wasn't much.

223
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:26,937
Depends on how long
you scratched for it

224
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,332
Six or seven months

225
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:32,000
One hundred and seventy seven dollars,
that don't even come to cow poke's pay.

226
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,057
I hope to do better.

227
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:37,852
Yeah, don't we all?

228
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,613
I don't know.

229
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:43,421
You're living steady in one town.
Got a nice family

230
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,337
You could talk about some too.
You know.

231
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,934
But I don't know, Tenneray,...

232
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,213
...you don't seem bad located here.

233
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,733
Making wages is all...

234
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,374
...about as much a month
as I used to spend in a day.

235
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,572
Yeah, without getting shot at

236
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,130
Getting talked at is near as bad.

237
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:12,533
Marv here pays me to stand around
and the cow pokes to buy drinks.

238
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:17,491
Then they start asking,
"How are things in Dodge,
Kansas City, Tombstone?"

239
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:22,087
I bet you're really the one
that can tell them. Huh?

240
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:26,611
You being funny?

241
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,404
No! No, I was just
remembering Kansas talk.

242
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,283
They say that you killed Ringo.

243
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:42,651
It's like me hearing you were
strung up dead by a posse in Santa Fe.

244
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,208
Well, that ain't
exactly the truth, but...

245
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:50,123
...somebody sure enough
killed Ringo.

246
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:54,001
Ha Ha, can't argue that!

247
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:57,926
I liked Ringo.
-So did I when he was sober.

248
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:03,408
I'll never forget when he fell
flat on his face coming
out of the Long Branch...

249
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,926
...stood up and yelled,
"Earp, get up and fight."

250
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,921
He never was one to risk anything
just to put on a show.

251
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,881
No, no he wasn't.

252
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,203
You can bet there were plenty
wondering how it would have come out.

253
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:22,843
Hey Marv, how about a cigar?
-Coming right up

254
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:27,400
So what's some
of your friends doing now?

255
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,363
What?

256
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:33,842
Wondering how it come out
-Ahh, playing with themselves...

257
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,518
...far as I'm concerned anyway

258
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:40,401
That's my feeling.

259
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:42,955
Think we ought to tell them?

260
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,514
Hell no, squaw bitches!
That's why I'm here.

261
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:48,923
A man get's thirsty watching
and waiting. Huh, Marv.

262
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:52,118
Well, everybody's got to be
somewhere doing something.

263
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:52,991
Yeah, ain't that right?

264
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,723
I think I'll chance
a belly ache on that.

265
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:03,432
Let's sit down.

266
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:05,994
Come on, Nancy, give me a kiss.

267
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:08,835
Don't tease me Davy. You know
you're not going to do anything.

268
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,559
How about you go on down
over yonder. Go on.

269
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:30,279
I thought for a minute there we were
going to have to look at our teeth.

270
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:31,948
Yeah

271
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:35,708
They'll sift a sack of grain
with their fingers to see
they're not cheated a cent.

272
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,790
They don't think twice of betting
twenty, fifty dollars to ...

273
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:41,471
...see which one will kill the other.
-Does that bother you?

274
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:43,073
Yeah

275
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,389
I think it does in some way.

276
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:52,827
Well let's say we did throw
down against each other.

277
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:56,747
Oh hell, we aren't going to,
but if we did,...

278
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:59,715
...who ever bet on the winner would
get a pot full. But what would we get?

279
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:01,622
I mean the one left standing...

280
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:04,149
...oh, a lot of back slapping,
some free drinks.

281
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:05,624
Shit!

282
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:09,182
Maybe we ought to sell tickets.
-Yeah

283
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,222
Look at them.

284
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:20,268
What are you looking at,
the girl or the game?

285
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,661
I've been away from both
for a long time.

286
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:28,028
Well, the game is fair, but tough.
-How about the girl?

287
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,260
What?

288
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,300
What's her name?

289
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,506
Jenny!

290
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:09,819
Just about this whole town is going
to cross the border on Sunday
to fight the bulls. Eh?

291
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:11,976
Well, what will you and
the little lady have to drink?

292
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:12,975
Thank you, ma'am.

293
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,659
This is Manuel Elegante,
wishes to buy a drink...

294
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:18,177
...for everybody.

295
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:20,369
It hit him pretty bad there in the back.

296
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,286
No need to let him suffer again

297
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,246
Do you want me to get rid of him?

298
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:37,971
I don't want him sold for meat.

299
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:41,565
If you want him put under ground,
I can get a couple of fellows
pretty reasonable pay.

300
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:45,641
No, I'll do it myself.
Where's the nearest free range?

301
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:47,729
A couple miles east of town

302
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:53,518
I'll need to rent a team,
a wagon to haul him in.

303
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,359
I guess I'll be needing to know
where I can buy a horse,
if there's one for sale.

304
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:03,241
Nick Canbury's got that rust-colored
gelding that he don't need...

305
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:04,479
...since his boy ran off with the cavalry.

306
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,647
If you ask me, it's a pretty good horse,...

307
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:07,797
...and it's waiting for you.

308
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,627
Can I help you?
-No thanks, just the same.

309
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:23,197
Isn't this kind of early up for you?

310
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:26,345
I ain't been to sleep at all.

311
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:28,073
How come?

312
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:31,550
Couldn't sleep for thinking.

313
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,110
A man goes on pretending long enough,...

314
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:41,185
...he, well he starts forgetting
what he's become.

315
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:44,908
And he sees it in front of him.

316
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,192
I don't see you the same as me.

317
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:53,066
Why, because I got a wife and kids?

318
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:54,389
And a job

319
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,302
A job?

320
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,590
Suckers and fools that buy drinks

321
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,544
Except I wear my pants on the outside...

322
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:05,306
...I'm no different than Jenny
you laid with last night.

323
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,948
I guess I know what you're talking about.

324
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:15,699
I worked at a job myself for a while
prospecting this last time.

325
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,146
Doing what?

326
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,585
Trick shooting, a medicine show

327
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,218
Besides me, they had a midget
and a tatooed fellow.

328
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:30,624
That says it better.

329
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:36,983
Say, Abe,...

330
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:41,426
...where you going from here?

331
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,377
Going nowhere 'til I buy
myself another horse.

332
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:48,620
Is that all you want?

333
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:53,616
I ain't short on wants, Tenneray.

334
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:57,856
But I don't see where
it's any of your business.

335
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,612
Yeah, it could be.

336
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:04,779
In what way?

337
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:11,180
The way you said last night?

338
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,011
About selling tickets, tickets.

339
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:23,570
You mean tickets for folks
to watch us kill each other?

340
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,576
That's what I mean.

341
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,457
Oh, come on, man. You got to know
I said that to show you
what a fool-thing it was.

342
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,894
Just think about it a second.

343
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,096
Both of us can ride out and
say we're going to face off.

344
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,215
Now what in the hell
are you talking about?
-Just let me finish!

345
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,650
We say we're going to do it.
All those men betting on us, women too...

346
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:40,935
...can't keep from looking at us,
afraid they're going to miss something.
You think they would't pay?

347
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:44,048
There are a lot to see us shoot it out.

348
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,573
No they wouldn't, not as long as
they knew it was some kind of show.

349
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:52,250
But you're not talking about
some kind of show, are you?
-No, I'm not.

350
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:55,766
Then what you're saying is that one
of us ought to really kill the other.

351
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:56,847
Is that what you're saying?

352
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:59,689
Winner take all.
Loser won't need any.

353
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:03,845
You know, Tenneray...

354
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:07,413
...little as I know you,
I had you figured
a lot more sensible than you are.

355
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,170
Damn!

356
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:11,526
Alright, smart fellow,...

357
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:14,728
...buy a cheap horse and...

358
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,765
...suck up to some friend
of yours for a job.

359
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:20,406
Damn if you don't mean it!
-Where are you going that's
better than where you've been?

360
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:21,766
Just don't worry for me. Huh?

361
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:23,206
I don't. I worry for me!

362
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:26,171
I've got a horse, Mister,
but I ain't going nowhere neither.

363
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:29,807
Do more prospecting...

364
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,520
...but next time you dig a hole,
crawl in and stay there
because you're so goddamn stupid!

365
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:45,842
You dissing me?

366
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,001
What do we do now, draw?

367
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,159
I don't want to kill you, Tenneray.

368
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,762
I don't want to kill you either.

369
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,156
What's that got to do with it?

370
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,642
Goddamn you, listen to me!

371
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,242
This is the last chance.
I'm talking about money!

372
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:11,435
Big money!

373
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:13,715
Get out of my way,
you son of a bitch!

374
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:37,272
I'll lay twenty dollars even...

375
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:39,080
...that Cross never gets
a shot off against Tenneray.

376
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,117
My money is on Cross.
He's a natural killer.

377
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:46,232
Tenneray's been living
soft here in town.

378
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,516
He knows better than to chance
his luck against Cross.

379
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,674
Now it's plain enough he don't seem
much different than anybody else.

380
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,988
Nice looking almost

381
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:04,951
Terreray's been a hired gun.
Gun fighting's his business.

382
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:06,831
Cross is scared. Look at him.

383
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:11,510
Cross and Terreray, they got
to fight sooner or later.
They got to.

384
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:17,189
If Terreray wants to kill somebody...

385
00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:18,750
...it ought to be his wife
and that Alvarez,...

386
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,144
...the trash that they are.

387
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:25,946
Abe Cross and Will Tenneray.

388
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:28,430
What do you know?

389
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:32,154
That's the first time in a long while
since either of them's met up...

390
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,508
... with somebody his own size.

391
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:44,226
Do you know where I can get a horse
for about a hundred dollars?

392
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:46,940
Don't know no hundred dollar horse,...

393
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,704
...at least one you could ride
from this town to the next.

394
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,862
Alvarez,...
-Yes?

395
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:20,216
I'm looking for a job.

396
00:34:20,987 --> 00:34:22,215
What kind of job?

397
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:23,263
I don't care.

398
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:26,136
Anything that will give me
the price of a decent horse.

399
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,422
Nothing in town this time of year

400
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:31,500
Maybe, maybe one of the ranchers

401
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:33,504
I don't know nothing
about herding beef.

402
00:34:34,745 --> 00:34:35,860
What do you know?

403
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:57,738
Tenneray!

404
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,136
How do you figure on doing it?

405
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:50,286
How many seats in that bull ring?

406
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:51,969
I figure a full house.

407
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:55,005
Does your wife know about this?

408
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:04,002
You just take your ten percent
for selling tickets and advertizing.

409
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,445
You don't own that bull-fight place.

410
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,890
We could go across the border
and make our own deal.

411
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:15,210
Something bothering you, Alvarez?

412
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,083
What you plan exactly?

413
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,803
Don't you think it is ugly?

414
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,403
What's so pretty about a
bull fighter and his friends...

415
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,161
...chopping up some
poor bull for money?

416
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,888
That is not the same.

417
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,798
You do not fight
in anger or defense.

418
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:39,567
How can the winner live?

419
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,439
A lot better than
he's living right now.

420
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,158
Hello
-What are you doing?

421
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,082
It don't matter where
I am during the day.

422
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:02,917
I don't go to work until seven.

423
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:06,080
Well, you can't stay here.
I've got things to do.

424
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:11,480
Well, I thought being strange
in town and not knowing anybody,...

425
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:12,992
...you might want to talk.

426
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,319
About what?

427
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:17,961
Oh, I don't know about what,...

428
00:37:18,282 --> 00:37:19,317
...anything you like.

429
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:20,552
What's the difference?

430
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,512
Is that your breakfast, milk?

431
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,156
I ain't hungry.

432
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,474
Hey, do you know Tenneray's wife?

433
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:39,788
Mrs. Tenneray?

434
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,795
Why sure, I got to meet her.
I know who she is, yes.

435
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:46,429
Know anything about her
and this fellow...

436
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,194
...Alvarez?

437
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:49,994
Oh

438
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,312
She was working
for Alvarez in his store...

439
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,356
...before she and Will
got back together.

440
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:58,626
Just working?

441
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:04,786
She and the boy had their
own rules, if that's what you mean.

442
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:13,429
But Alvarez was over there
most every night.

443
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:15,143
...for dinner, you know.

444
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:16,704
How long?

445
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:20,146
How long what, was he over there?

446
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:22,588
No, I mean how long did she
work for him that way?

447
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:24,428
More than three years

448
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,300
She and Will were separate
about eight, I think.

449
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,782
Makes no difference what they
did or didn't. You know town talk.

450
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:44,869
Imagine Will heard some
of that "town talk", didn't he?

451
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,662
Not to his face, but...

452
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,708
...Why, did he say something
to you about it?

453
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:54,945
No.

454
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:57,938
Okay, you can go now.

455
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:01,902
What are you so mad at?

456
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:03,740
Who says I'm mad?

457
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,341
Well, look at yourself!

458
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:07,739
The way you're grumping and pushing!

459
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:14,825
Last night you were
so easy and all that.

460
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:20,302
Now you would just as soon shove me
out the window as the door.

461
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:23,944
I bet that's never happened to you, huh?

462
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:35,059
What's happened to me ain't
no excuse for the way you are.

463
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,417
Hey, almost forgot

464
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,576
Marv said I shouldn't.

465
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,220
I don't care what Marv said,...

466
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:51,611
...and neither do you.

467
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,097
I'd like you to take it, Jenny.
I'm asking.

468
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,853
Am I going to see you later?
-Yeah, I'll be in there.

469
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:09,768
I don't mean in there.
I mean afterwards.

470
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:12,214
Yeah.

471
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:15,293
Okay

472
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:20,929
Last night you came home and you tell
me what a fine fellow this Cross is.

473
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:23,775
"Well, we ought to have him
by for dinner", you said.
-Well, I thought that was so.

474
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:27,846
Oh yes, you're fine friends now
just because you sat down
easy as you please...

475
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:29,573
...and decided to kill one another.
That don't mean that you're not...

476
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:32,454
Oh Nora, now don't put an edge
to what you don't know.

477
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:34,447
Now he's got needs same as me...

478
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:36,570
...and what we agreed to
fits us both.

479
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,048
Well, this don't fit me, Will...

480
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:43,763
...and it won't fit your son
growing up without you.

481
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:46,848
You already got me whipped?

482
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:50,683
Well, I never happy for us,
I wouldn't be here.

483
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,246
Abe Cross is here too.

484
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:54,967
I know that.

485
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:57,999
But I also know that Alvarez says...

486
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:01,527
...there could be five, six thousand
dollars waiting for us when this is done.

487
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:02,760
Franco?

488
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,199
What are you surprised at?

489
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,206
Who are you calling some
cucaracha saint, huh?

490
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,362
He's helping you in this?

491
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,281
He's hoping to help himself...

492
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:19,807
...and get more than ten percent
of the money if it turns out
the way he'd like.

493
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,882
Oh Will, please!

494
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,876
Please, please what?

495
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:29,283
Franco.

496
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,964
Wasn't he hoping to hear me dead
all the years you were working for him?

497
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:37,282
Well, wasn't he?

498
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:40,921
For Christ's sakes, do I need a sign
to tell me what everybody
in this town knows?

499
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,564
He didn't want me back.

500
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:44,084
He didn't want you to take me back,...

501
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:46,998
...and he's been waiting this year
quiet and gentle for us to bust up.

502
00:41:57,523 --> 00:42:00,554
Will, I can't help what
anybody else feels,...

503
00:42:00,723 --> 00:42:02,678
...Franco or anybody else.

504
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:04,355
But it don't change what I feel.

505
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:09,913
You and Bud, there ain't anything
for me worth risking either.

506
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:14,472
No I don't do this for risking more.

507
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:17,676
That's not true. That's saying
we got nothing to lose.

508
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,955
You can't say that, Will.

509
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,516
You can't lose a man
if you ain't got one.

510
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,112
I ain't been much of that
since I came back.

511
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:25,109
That's not true.

512
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,148
Oh darling, we ain't two kids
going to bed for the first time.

513
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:32,230
Christ, a man's got a family,
a wife, a son...

514
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:35,436
...he's got to do for that family
or else he's just a joke.

515
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:38,347
You're a liar,...

516
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:42,955
...a goddamn liar.

517
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:51,191
You don't give a damn about the money
or the land or anything else.

518
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:52,913
You want to be Will Tenneray again.

519
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:55,313
Will Tenneray with a gun in his hand.

520
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:07,182
Mr. Cross!

521
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,945
Mr. Cross, I was just over
doing business with Alvarez,...

522
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:13,830
...and he said that you fellows were---

523
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,948
You already made your bet on Tenneray.
Is that it?

524
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:17,466
Yes, but only because you said---

525
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:19,270
Yeah, you might make
yourself some money.

526
00:43:19,432 --> 00:43:22,229
No sir. I'd never bet Tenneray
against you in a real fight.

527
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,586
No, how come?
-Because I saw you
that one time up in---

528
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:26,104
You ever seen Tenneray?
-No, sir.

529
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,542
But Mr. Cross, you promised me.

530
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,784
You stay the hell away from me.
You hear?
-Yes, sir.

531
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:55,899
Mr. Cross, that there is
Nora Tenneray, Will's wife.
-Yeah

532
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:58,976
I wonder if I could get you fellows
to do something for me,...

533
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:03,377
...help me find this Canbury
that's got the gelding for sale.

534
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:34,297
Why'd you do it?

535
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:36,695
Why are you helping him?

536
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:41,056
I'd have had more respect for you
if you'd have took a gun and
gone after him in the streets.

537
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,017
Then I would be more like him.

538
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:47,810
But you didn't want me like him.

539
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:51,377
When your son needed a father
and he was not here.

540
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:55,292
When you needed a man
and he was not here.

541
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:56,647
It wasn't like that.

542
00:44:57,098 --> 00:44:59,054
It was like that, Nora.

543
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:01,816
You could lie to me...

544
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:05,256
...but your body could not.

545
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:07,212
Stop it!

546
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,129
I don't think about that any more.

547
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:13,500
And it don't matter what happens.
Understand? It don't matter
if Will gets killed or what.

548
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:16,535
I ain't coming back to you Franco.
I ain't never coming back.

549
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:19,974
Where will you go then?

550
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:47,369
Howdy, my name's David.

551
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:50,441
...bought you a drink
one time down in Galveston.

552
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,806
Time you was called out by Barney Held,
I'll be deuced!

553
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,202
Are they really putting
some fellow against you in a gunfight?

554
00:46:00,129 --> 00:46:01,721
Just, uh,  Will Tenneray.

555
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:05,598
Yes, sir. I'v heard of him,
and I seen Mr. Cross here.

556
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:09,405
Me and my boys got four hundred
dollars backing Abe Cross.

557
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:11,724
Any takers?
-I will. I'll back him.

558
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:16,441
I'll get some too.

559
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,205
I need a drink.

560
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:22,962
That ought to put
the fear of God into you.

561
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:25,804
I ain't fighting God...

562
00:46:26,685 --> 00:46:29,040
...unless you've been
holding out on me.
-Mr. Cross.

563
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:32,279
Uh, Mr. Cross,...

564
00:46:33,004 --> 00:46:34,323
...this here is Dean Canbury.

565
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:37,442
Oh hi, how you doing Mr. Canbury?
I'm Abe Cross.

566
00:46:37,604 --> 00:46:39,753
I know who you are,
but that don't matter to me.

567
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,676
Now don't start bull-dogging me.
Here, have a drink.

568
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:44,322
I don't drink when I trade.

569
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:46,312
It's a good horse...

570
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:49,792
...worth every bit of
three hundred dollars,
and nobody is taking it for less.

571
00:46:50,082 --> 00:46:51,435
I don't care who you are.

572
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:53,397
I see.

573
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:56,071
Well, Will here tells me
it's a good, sound horse alright...

574
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:57,993
...and his word is
good enough for me, but...

575
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:01,788
...Will put the value
of the horse at about 250.

576
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,790
Right, Will?

577
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,035
It's my opinion.

578
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,793
Your opinion, my horse

579
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:12,118
Well, I'll tell you what, Mr. Canbury,...

580
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:14,951
I'm going to pay you a price
you're asking for your horse...

581
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:18,957
...but, I just ain't got quite
that much on me right now.

582
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,457
And his credit ain't too good.

583
00:47:21,997 --> 00:47:24,670
You're having your fun,
I've got better things to do.

584
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:26,350
Wait a minute,
I haven't made my offer yet.

585
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:28,266
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

586
00:47:28,677 --> 00:47:30,234
I'll pay you fifty dollars now.

587
00:47:30,636 --> 00:47:34,231
You give me the use of the horse
till a week from this coming Sunday...

588
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:38,545
...and at that time I'll pay you
two hundred fifty more.

589
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,074
Over my dead body

590
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:44,623
Of course now, uh,...

591
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:48,031
...if I ain't up to paying you
that two hundred and fifty more...

592
00:47:48,394 --> 00:47:50,304
...a week from this coming Sunday,...

593
00:47:50,873 --> 00:47:53,990
...you keep that fifty in your pocket
and take your horse back.

594
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:57,308
You paying my full price
a week from Sunday...

595
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:59,428
...or I keep the money
and the horse too?

596
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:01,422
That's right.

597
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:11,024
I'll have a drink now, Will.

598
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,901
I haven't had so much fuss
made over me in a long time.

599
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:21,422
That is the first thing
you said to me all night.

600
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:23,505
Oh, is that right?

601
00:48:24,149 --> 00:48:26,787
Well, I thought I said enough
this morning to last a while.

602
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:31,867
You knew this morning that you
were going to do this thing
with Will. Didn't you?

603
00:48:32,148 --> 00:48:32,967
Uh-huh

604
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,260
Why didn't you tell me?

605
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,257
What for?

606
00:48:38,507 --> 00:48:41,782
So I would know. That's what for,
instead of someone else telling me.

607
00:48:43,986 --> 00:48:45,214
What difference does it make?

608
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:49,657
I don't know, but it makes a difference.

609
00:48:50,105 --> 00:48:50,935
That's all.

610
00:48:52,784 --> 00:48:53,614
Quiet!

611
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:02,972
I don't care. You hear?

612
00:49:03,003 --> 00:49:03,975
He started it!

613
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:06,354
Never mind who started what!

614
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:08,354
I got my own ideas on that too.

615
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:12,219
Now get him on his horse
and back where he come from.

616
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,815
Let's go.

617
00:49:14,022 --> 00:49:16,171
Get those gents to go home
and stay there!

618
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,896
I think we have to make arrangements.

619
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:29,681
The church bell in town
rings every hour.

620
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:33,404
Next Sunday on the fourth stroke...

621
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,925
...the gunfight will begin.

622
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:43,234
Ladies and gentlemen...

623
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:48,150
...next Sunday at this same time...

624
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,553
...you will see something...

625
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,435
...that has never been seen before.

626
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,396
Not a man and a bull,...

627
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:58,671
...but two men.

628
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:01,790
These two men...

629
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:06,468
...will meet here
in a gunfight to the death.

630
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:14,468
[SPANISH DIALOGUE]

631
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:12,621
Good afternoon, neighbors.

632
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:17,184
My name's Fleury, Eddie Fleury.

633
00:53:17,348 --> 00:53:18,541
I'm with the El Paso Herald.

634
00:53:20,187 --> 00:53:22,180
We heard there were uh,...

635
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:27,144
...two gunfighters are going
to put on some kind of show
here this coming Sunday.

636
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:34,615
Whose idea was it?
-Well, both of us, kind of.
-Uh-huh

637
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,417
Alright, why don't we get some pictures
over here under this sign...

638
00:53:39,504 --> 00:53:42,382
...surrounded by your gallery
of admirers

639
00:53:46,503 --> 00:53:48,997
Why don't you guys
get up on the porch there?

640
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:51,582
Are you ready, Joey?

641
00:53:51,823 --> 00:53:53,097
In a minute, Mr. Fleury.

642
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:58,094
I was wondering, uh...

643
00:53:59,462 --> 00:54:00,496
What happens with the money,...

644
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:03,459
...not the money that's been bet,
but your money?

645
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:05,236
The ticket money?
-What happens if, uh...

646
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:06,934
...well, if nothing happens?

647
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,256
What do you mean?

648
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,198
I mean if you both miss, say.

649
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:18,609
Well, we hadn't thought
about that, Mr. Fleury.

650
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:20,452
I guess we're not as smart as him.

651
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:21,846
Or I just meant, uh...

652
00:54:23,378 --> 00:54:24,697
I mean it's possible. Isn't it?

653
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,788
Yeah, it's possible.
Everything's possible, but...

654
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:32,291
Say, do you think they sent these
two fellows all the way here for free.

655
00:54:32,657 --> 00:54:34,534
I told you I was from
the El Paso Herald.

656
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:37,609
But you ain't told us how much they was paying us for our talk, our pitches.

657
00:54:38,016 --> 00:54:39,415
Paying?
-Yeah

658
00:54:40,296 --> 00:54:43,047
Ha Ha Ha
No, we don't pay for news.

659
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:46,095
Well, we don't pose
for pictures without getting paid.

660
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:50,093
So, you'd better pack up and
take your things back to El Paso...

661
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,131
...and you can tell them the news.
Come on, Abe.

662
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:55,739
Uh, wait a minute guys.
Wait a minute fellows.

663
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:01,932
I'll give you ten dollars
for the pictures.

664
00:55:02,013 --> 00:55:03,162
I was thinking twenty five...

665
00:55:04,732 --> 00:55:05,528
...each.

666
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,968
Oh,come on. That's, uh...

667
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:10,741
Fine?
Did you hear him
say, "That's fine"?

668
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:12,249
Not out loud, not yet

669
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:15,683
Alright, come on. Come on.

670
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:16,647
Now?

671
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,718
There you are,...

672
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:29,199
...and there you are.

673
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,205
You be ready now, Joey.
-Yeah

674
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:40,803
First let's have
one shaking hands...

675
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:42,796
...if you don't mind.

676
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:46,801
Look this way, please.

677
00:55:49,006 --> 00:55:49,802
Hold it!

678
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:55,160
Alright, now let's get one
with the guns drawn.

679
00:56:00,205 --> 00:56:02,274
No, no, facing each other

680
00:56:06,164 --> 00:56:07,040
Ready now?

681
00:56:08,523 --> 00:56:09,319
Hold it.

682
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:11,993
Good, I've got it.

683
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,720
Alright now, one smiling

684
00:56:17,322 --> 00:56:18,721
Come on now, big smile!

685
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:21,998
Hold it.

686
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:27,556
Excuse me, all.

687
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,874
I'm looking for
Abe Cross and Will Tenneray.

688
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,313
Now this here is Mr. Tenneray
and this is Mr. Cross.

689
00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:39,709
How do you do.

690
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,068
I'll fight one of you.

691
00:56:51,197 --> 00:56:53,392
Either one, it don't matter.

692
00:57:02,516 --> 00:57:04,666
Roy, wait a minute.
Hang it up here.
Put the camera up here.

693
00:57:04,836 --> 00:57:06,188
Alright, move on out of here.

694
00:57:09,715 --> 00:57:10,625
Hey, young fellow,...

695
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:12,942
...what do you want to fight for?

696
00:57:13,314 --> 00:57:14,110
Money

697
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:16,067
Same reason you
want at each other

698
00:57:17,674 --> 00:57:19,823
Figure me. If I kill one of you,...

699
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:22,383
...then the other one has
to fight me for the money come Sunday.

700
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:24,269
Now, ain't that right?

701
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:28,269
That's your reason.
Now, what's ours?

702
00:57:31,672 --> 00:57:32,900
Keep from getting killed, I guess.

703
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:34,340
That's enough from all of you.

704
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,068
You go on. Ride out of here,
or I'm going to arrest you.

705
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,668
I ain't done nothing
to be arrested.

706
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,982
Look, old man,
why don't you just step aside.

707
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:48,707
I'm standing where I'm standing.

708
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:51,463
Tom, it ain't worth it.

709
00:57:52,189 --> 00:57:53,542
You telling me how to wear my badge?

710
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:56,301
It ain't his doing he's here.
It's yours.

711
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:58,060
Yours and his.

712
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:01,737
I can't stop what you're planning
across the border,...

713
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,747
...but I sure as hell got a say
to what happens right here.

714
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:11,099
Now, do you want your horse or do you
want the night in the jail house.

715
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:16,262
If you need help making up your mind,
I'll give you some.

716
00:58:16,425 --> 00:58:19,383
Don't you come at me.
That's forcing a fight,
and you know it.

717
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:20,661
I know what I said!

718
00:58:32,023 --> 00:58:33,812
Damn it.
-Is he alright?

719
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:39,980
There, they're going at it again.
Get off the street. Come on!

720
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:42,758
Get back! Get off the street.
Get out of here!

721
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:46,652
You seen what he done.
He pushed me to it.

722
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,613
I could have killed him,
but I didn't.

723
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:01,208
Not him I want.

724
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:03,408
Then do what you want.

725
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:52,200
Get her back here now!

726
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:55,366
You feeling better now?

727
00:59:58,451 --> 01:00:01,409
Well, he's hurt pretty bad, Will,
but I think he's going to be alright.

728
01:00:01,571 --> 01:00:02,686
I'm going to go get the doctor.

729
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,283
Kid, move back there now.

730
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:09,720
Alright, go ahead now. Go on.

731
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:15,678
Move back now. Move back there.

732
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:39,659
Mr. Tenneray, Oh, Mr. Tenneray,
could we get a picture of you
here, with uh, with a, uh,...

733
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:09,620
Hey Bud, why don't you go on up
and get yourself washed
for supper, huh?

734
01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:11,220
Sure, Pa.

735
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:29,987
I was thinking, with all the fuss
going on till the fight...

736
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:31,193
What are you thinking?

737
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:32,747
Well, about Bud.

738
01:01:34,078 --> 01:01:36,637
Maybe it would be a good idea
to put him on the stage
to Austin in the morning.

739
01:01:36,837 --> 01:01:38,350
Let him spend the time with the Morgans.

740
01:01:38,877 --> 01:01:41,789
They got kids his age.
-So he won't be around me, huh?

741
01:01:43,276 --> 01:01:44,550
No, not the way you are now.

742
01:01:46,396 --> 01:01:48,785
The way I am now is
the first time he's noticed me...

743
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:50,513
...from furniture
the whole year I've been back.

744
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:53,634
What am I, not supposed to like that?

745
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,469
For yourself maybe, but not
for him, Will. I'm thinking of him.

746
01:01:58,154 --> 01:01:58,950
And I'm not, huh?

747
01:02:00,114 --> 01:02:02,548
Has he asked you yet to show him
how you use your gun?

748
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,149
He will.

749
01:02:05,953 --> 01:02:06,829
You know he will.

750
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:11,183
You want him to think that's all
his Pa's got to teach him,
to give him?

751
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,108
Well, maybe it is.

752
01:02:12,592 --> 01:02:13,991
No, don't tell me that now.

753
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:16,917
Nora, for God's sakes,
What do you want from me?

754
01:02:17,232 --> 01:02:18,221
I want you to live.

755
01:02:23,871 --> 01:02:26,989
I want you to show your son that you
don't have to kill somebody to live.

756
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,104
Sounds fine in words

757
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,066
But it don't get
a man what he wants.

758
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:37,625
Will.

759
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:41,307
What do I have to do to stop you?

760
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,662
Don't stop me. Help me.

761
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:53,135
I'm going to have to kill a man
might be the last good friend I've got.

762
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:55,217
But you don't have to.
-Yes, yes I do, Nora.

763
01:02:55,386 --> 01:02:56,455
I want things to be different.

764
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,896
We could buy Mac lntyre's ranch.
Think about that.

765
01:03:00,546 --> 01:03:02,103
But I can only think
he might kill you.

766
01:03:06,345 --> 01:03:11,583
Ain't you told me since the day we met
the thing I know best is guns. Huh?

767
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:13,340
Pa.

768
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,133
I'll be right up.

769
01:03:25,462 --> 01:03:26,292
No, Nora,...

770
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:30,016
...I ain't never going to
be beat in no gunfight.

771
01:03:31,661 --> 01:03:33,777
It's the only thing in this
goddamn world I'm sure of.

772
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,534
Forty-five the Colt.

773
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,456
I'll need about a hundred.

774
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:49,969
How much?
-Eight dollar and a half.

775
01:04:04,097 --> 01:04:05,131
Something on your mind?

776
01:04:08,456 --> 01:04:10,253
Thought maybe you'd want
to wish me luck or something

777
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:26,043
Easy, Pa.

778
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,725
Roy, I ain't done that in a while.

779
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:41,485
Can I try, Pa?

780
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:44,001
Not yet, son.
It takes a little learning.

781
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:47,763
Mac, we make a deal, that horse
is going to be part of it.

782
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,727
You'll get what you pay for, Will.

783
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:53,004
Besides, I can't retire and
take this horse with me.

784
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:58,648
I love that animal.
Alright, Bud.
Come on there!

785
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,208
I'll show you the rest of the spread.

786
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:01,279
Sure, Pa.

787
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:03,917
Thanks a lot, Mac.

788
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:05,558
Goodbye, Mr. Mac lntyre.

789
01:05:05,728 --> 01:05:06,524
Thank you.

790
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:17,440
Moving east from that gorge
is more than a hundred acres

791
01:05:17,926 --> 01:05:19,075
Enough to run beef.

792
01:05:19,926 --> 01:05:22,504
Grow our own feed?
You like that?

793
01:05:23,026 --> 01:05:23,864
Huh?

794
01:05:24,365 --> 01:05:25,639
What'll I do after school?

795
01:05:25,805 --> 01:05:26,874
Be helping me.

796
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:31,760
Ah, you wouldn't know.
You've lived in other people's
rooms all your life, but...

797
01:05:32,124 --> 01:05:34,240
...you'll feel different
when you've got your own place.

798
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:36,116
How's it feel?
-What?

799
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:38,281
Like you say,
having your own place.

800
01:05:39,643 --> 01:05:42,599
Well, I don't know, never had it.

801
01:05:42,883 --> 01:05:45,840
Moved around too much, but seen other folks

802
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:47,441
That's why I want it for us.

803
01:05:47,762 --> 01:05:48,592
Okay

804
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:52,080
What do you mean, "Okay"?
-Didn't mean nothing

805
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:53,196
Just okay

806
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,996
Whoa
-What is it, Pa?

807
01:06:07,479 --> 01:06:08,594
You just stay here.

808
01:06:52,193 --> 01:06:53,592
I told him what you asked.

809
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:56,226
They're arguing it now.

810
01:06:58,352 --> 01:06:59,626
So Will could do the job.

811
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:01,902
You told him you thought he could.
Didn't you?

812
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:03,541
But it ain't up to me.

813
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,789
Some of them feel that
giving Will my badge...

814
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:09,464
...would bring in more trouble
than it would stop.

815
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,828
Tom, what'll you do now?

816
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:15,547
Oh, I guess if I can shave
and put my pants on alone...

817
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:16,825
...I'll find something.

818
01:07:21,229 --> 01:07:22,025
Good night, Nora.

819
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:29,058
Nora, the council voted against
recommending Will for deputy.

820
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:31,382
Did you all vote the same way?

821
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:34,537
It was a secret vote,
got to respect that.

822
01:07:35,707 --> 01:07:36,537
I'm sorry, Nora.

823
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:39,142
Evening to you.

824
01:07:43,106 --> 01:07:46,222
What you think is true.
I voted against him.

825
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:49,458
For the good of the town?
-That also, yes,...

826
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:51,455
...and for me

827
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,852
You were the kindest man
I ever knew, Franco.

828
01:08:04,703 --> 01:08:05,533
I was a fool.

829
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:08,941
I don't understand anymore.

830
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,180
I don't understand anything anymore.

831
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:02,525
Give me two.

832
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:06,889
Two

833
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:08,924
Two

834
01:09:10,254 --> 01:09:11,083
One

835
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:12,768
Two

836
01:09:20,612 --> 01:09:21,488
I'll check my hand.

837
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:25,128
I'll check.

838
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:28,646
I bet fifty dollars.

839
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,043
Call and raise you seventy-five.

840
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:38,840
I'm out.

841
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:40,365
I'm out.

842
01:09:50,368 --> 01:09:53,636
Call seventy-five, and up it a hundred

843
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:02,682
I'm all in.

844
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:04,799
You knew that when you bet me.

845
01:10:06,446 --> 01:10:07,322
Yeah, I guess I did.

846
01:10:08,485 --> 01:10:09,838
Tell you what, Dave...

847
01:10:10,365 --> 01:10:14,575
...you'll be shy a hundred.
If you win, one of us
will pay you tomorrow.

848
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:16,432
One of you?

849
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:18,241
Yeah

850
01:10:19,484 --> 01:10:20,280
Oh

851
01:10:21,724 --> 01:10:23,759
Is that alright?
-Sure, that's fine.

852
01:10:25,963 --> 01:10:26,759
Then I call you.

853
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:28,759
Jacks full

854
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:35,675
Beats a flush every time

855
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:38,791
Gentlemen

856
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,949
My thanks anyway

857
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,836
Don't thank me.
You may be the one paying.

858
01:10:56,839 --> 01:10:59,193
Abe, as long as Marv
is standing the drinks,...

859
01:10:59,358 --> 01:11:00,837
...why don't we
sit down for a while?

860
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,593
Well, my Dad always said,
"Tired and broke, pack your boat".

861
01:11:07,917 --> 01:11:09,111
He never was very fun.

862
01:11:10,677 --> 01:11:11,587
See you tomorrow

863
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:14,869
Don't you want to be with me?

864
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:17,792
Good night, Jen

865
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:06,851
Are you alright?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

866
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,754
She did't know what she was doing.

867
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:11,856
Should've

868
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:15,739
What's happening ain't
your fault any more than his,...

869
01:13:16,379 --> 01:13:19,337
...any more than everybody else's
for that matter.

870
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:21,331
Who's everybody else?

871
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:25,094
Folks in this town and riding
in this town a betting, buying tickets.

872
01:13:26,138 --> 01:13:28,446
You and Will wouldn't
even be meeting tomorrow...

873
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,096
...if folks wasn't paying to watch!

874
01:13:33,217 --> 01:13:34,787
Yeah, I guess that's so.

875
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:39,894
But we always had a chance to pass
those folks by, didn't we, Jen?

876
01:13:43,895 --> 01:13:44,691
Abe.

877
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:46,851
Abe!

878
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:53,485
Oh, how do I fuss with a man who's...

879
01:13:53,654 --> 01:13:55,997
...likely to be buried tomorrow?

880
01:14:00,973 --> 01:14:03,425
I shouldn't have said that.

881
01:14:05,492 --> 01:14:07,630
Because you think that's the way
it might be. Right?

882
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:09,994
I don't want to think it, but...

883
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:13,170
...it could turn out that way.

884
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:19,799
Jenny, there's nobody
faster with a gun than me.

885
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,569
I've known it
ever since I was a kid,...

886
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,560
...ever since the first time
I picked up a gun.

887
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:28,281
There's nothing good or bad about it.

888
01:14:29,409 --> 01:14:32,980
There's certainly nothing
brave or noble,
but that's just the way it is.

889
01:14:34,448 --> 01:14:35,893
It's something I can do,...

890
01:14:36,328 --> 01:14:39,761
...and it's something I can do
better than anybody
in the whole world.

891
01:14:51,526 --> 01:14:52,356
Where you going?

892
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:56,197
Uh, back to my place.

893
01:15:00,044 --> 01:15:01,113
I don't want you to.

894
01:15:04,444 --> 01:15:05,672
You said you did.

895
01:15:07,043 --> 01:15:07,998
Don't now

896
01:17:13,946 --> 01:17:14,742
Will.

897
01:17:18,825 --> 01:17:20,543
Mr. Cross, come with me please.

898
01:17:20,785 --> 01:17:21,581
Abe.

899
01:17:24,624 --> 01:17:26,933
Those folks paid a lot
of money to see us.

900
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:22,614
Ladies and gentlemen,...

901
01:18:24,056 --> 01:18:27,953
...in a few minutes
it will be four o'clock,...

902
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:31,528
...and the bell in your church...

903
01:18:31,715 --> 01:18:34,209
...tower will ring four times.

904
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:38,610
The last bell will be a signal...

905
01:18:38,854 --> 01:18:40,969
...for the gunfight to begin!

906
01:18:52,532 --> 01:18:54,124
Will Tenneray!

907
01:19:12,809 --> 01:19:15,559
Abe Cross!

908
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:43,905
That'll pay Canbury for the horse.

909
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,165
That'll cover what I lost in poker.

910
01:22:01,425 --> 01:22:02,221
Jenny,...

911
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:10,763
...I was just thinking that, uh,
I'd like to give you something.

912
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:11,860
What?

913
01:22:13,943 --> 01:22:17,723
I don't know,
a present maybe, or something.

914
01:22:19,063 --> 01:22:20,052
Thanks anyway

915
01:22:23,502 --> 01:22:25,970
Well, if you ever get up
to San Francisco sometime...

916
01:22:27,502 --> 01:22:28,377
Me!

917
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:29,617
What for?

918
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:33,577
Well, I'll be there.

919
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:37,378
No, don't think you will

920
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:43,705
You're going to ride north
to towns that ain't heard
what's going on down here.

921
01:22:44,379 --> 01:22:45,494
And some fellow...

922
01:22:47,059 --> 01:22:50,930
...somewhere is going to think
he is faster than you are.

923
01:22:52,498 --> 01:22:54,170
Going to want to fight
you for money again

924
01:22:55,418 --> 01:22:56,770
And I don't need money now.

925
01:22:57,657 --> 01:22:58,851
Well, that's now.

926
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:02,650
It ain't the money, Abe.

927
01:23:04,096 --> 01:23:05,051
It's you.

928
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:09,994
Yeah well, when did you get
so smart that you know
what I'm going to do?

929
01:23:10,576 --> 01:23:11,724
Last night

930
01:23:12,855 --> 01:23:14,447
Yeah, you just might
be wrong, you know.

931
01:23:15,655 --> 01:23:16,804
I hope so.

932
01:23:20,814 --> 01:23:21,644
Bye

933
01:23:29,953 --> 01:23:32,980
Bud, time to go now

934
01:25:31,716 --> 01:25:34,866
The hell with all of them,
Dekker, Hale, this whole town.

935
01:25:36,115 --> 01:25:38,151
You'd think I'd done something
to them, the way they're acting!

936
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:41,868
I never did like
this dirt land anyway.

937
01:25:42,354 --> 01:25:44,345
You know, I've seen
places in Wyoming...

938
01:25:44,634 --> 01:25:46,829
...Colorado Territory,
even Kansas,...

939
01:25:47,114 --> 01:25:48,831
...a lot better land
than they've got here...

940
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:52,142
...and I bet they're no more money
than Mac lntyre's asked.

941
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:54,389
As soon as I find the right place,...

942
01:25:55,112 --> 01:25:57,830
...I send for you and Bud. Huh?

943
01:25:58,872 --> 01:26:02,943
Where ever you go now,
there'll be men wanting
to try you for money again.

944
01:26:04,471 --> 01:26:05,945
The hell with them!

945
01:26:06,151 --> 01:26:07,345
We got money now.

946
01:26:07,831 --> 01:26:10,605
Half will take care of things
while I'm gone.

947
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:16,246
The other half, I'll put down
a deposit when I find
a place we want.

948
01:26:18,629 --> 01:26:19,425
Stay here.

949
01:26:21,349 --> 01:26:22,668
I thought it over.

950
01:26:26,028 --> 01:26:27,586
You like the Mac lntyre place.

951
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:29,903
Remember all the things you
was going to do to fix it up?

952
01:26:30,067 --> 01:26:32,425
I said I thought it over.
Didn't I?

953
01:26:44,705 --> 01:26:45,501
Nora,...

954
01:26:50,105 --> 01:26:52,776
...I know we can do better
someplace else.

955
01:26:54,954 --> 01:26:57,621
We had a bigger horse than this
when I went to California.

956
01:26:57,974 --> 01:26:58,921
Howdy, Marv!

957
01:27:00,143 --> 01:27:01,462
Hey, it's time to go.

958
01:27:03,543 --> 01:27:05,181
Hey, you take care of your Ma
while I'm gone. Huh?

959
01:27:05,343 --> 01:27:07,617
Sure, Pa.
-Don't forget.
It won't take me long.

960
01:27:07,782 --> 01:27:09,659
Alright, you hurry home.
-I will now.

961
01:27:10,062 --> 01:27:11,097
Goodbye
-Goodbye.

962
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,577
Do you think she will go back with Alvarez?

963
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,176
No.

964
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:31,732
Not right away.
