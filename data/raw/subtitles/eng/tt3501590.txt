1
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,383
- Come on, let's go!

2
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,738
You okay?

3
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,603
<i> We must </i>
<i> be set to face a long war</i>

4
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,340
<i> against crafty</i>
<i> and powerful bandits.</i>

5
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,912
<i> The attack at Pearl harbor</i>
<i> can be repeated</i>

6
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,947
<i> at any one of many points,</i>

7
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,917
<i> in both oceans</i>
<i> and along both our coastlines</i>

8
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,955
<i> and against</i>
<i>all the rest of the hemisphere.</i>

9
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:14,626
<i>It will not only be a long war,</i>
<i> it will be a hard war.</i>

10
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,096
<i> We expect to eliminate</i>
<i> the danger from Japan,</i>

11
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:22,968
<i> but it would serve us ill</i>
<i> if we accomplished that</i>

12
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,172
<i> and found that the rest</i>
<i> of the world was dominated</i>

13
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,641
<i> by Hitler and Mussolini.</i>

14
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,645
<i> We are going to win this war</i>

15
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:38,116
<i> and we are going to win</i>
<i> the peace that follows.</i>

16
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:42,421
- Is it a letter from home?
- Yep, from my brother, homer.

17
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,193
- It's the youngest one, right?
- Uh, no, no.

18
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,162
Youngest one's ulysses.

19
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,264
He's, um...

20
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,633
Well, he's four.

21
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,973
<i> He believes nothing good</i>
<i> ever ends.</i>

22
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,742
<i> And he's under the impression</i>
<i> that he belongs</i>

23
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,944
<i> wherever there's something</i>
<i> interesting to see.</i>

24
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,519
<i> I have this idea</i>
<i> that you'll come to ithaca</i>

25
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,021
<i> and meet him one day.</i>

26
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,690
<i> And my brother homer,</i>

27
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,227
<i> my sister Bess... and ma.</i>

28
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,207
- Hiya, Harry!

29
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,853
- Fourteen words, collect.

30
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,425
You're a little short.
- A little.

31
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,094
I got drafted.
- Drafted, I see.

32
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,129
- My mother'll send me
enough money to get home.

33
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,597
- Uh-huh.

34
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,933
- Do you know how long
it'll take the telegram

35
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,368
to get to her?

36
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,075
What's that?

37
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,876
Why...? What's this?

38
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,113
- Just go ahead. It's nothing.
Don't worry about it. Just...

39
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,881
- Wh-why? What's--

40
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,150
- you pay me back when
your mother sends the money.

41
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,618
- Thanks.

42
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,658
- Send it paid, Willie!

43
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,929
- Tom...

44
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,964
- What?

45
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,634
I know, Willie. It's just...
Every once in a while.

46
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,907
So remind me, why do you want
to be a messenger?

47
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,643
- Because I'll get to visit
a lot of people

48
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,980
and go to a lot of places.

49
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,750
- Oh. And, uh,
how did you sleep last night?

50
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,651
D'you nod off today at school?

51
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,654
- A little.

52
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,823
- What about sports?

53
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,292
What about missing out on them
on account of having this job?

54
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,929
- We have a physical-education
period every day.

55
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:42,501
- Is that so? Well, I used
to run the 220 low hurdles

56
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,503
when I went to ithaca high.

57
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,539
I was, uh...
I was the valley champion.

58
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,010
I was val...

59
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,349
So tell me,
you really want this job?

60
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,185
- I'm gonna be the best
messenger this office ever had.

61
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,722
- I was the best messenger this
office ever had, so you're on.

62
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,124
Okay, the faster
you deliver messages,

63
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,859
the more you can deliver.

64
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,195
The faster you pick up
outgoing messages,

65
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,397
the more we can send.
The more we can send,

66
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,699
the better our chances
of beating western union

67
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,169
and staying alive.
We're postal telegraph.

68
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,404
We get there swiftly.
We're polite to everyone.

69
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,473
We take off our hats
in elevators and,

70
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,774
above all things,

71
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,044
we never lose a telegram.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,150
- How old are you?

73
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,585
- Sixteen.

74
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,187
- Yeah, that's
what you said yesterday.

75
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,456
We're not allowed
to hire a boy unless he's 16.

76
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,691
How old are you?

77
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,093
- Fourteen.

78
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,264
- Well, so you'll be 16
in two years.

79
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,100
What are you gonna do
with the $15 a week?

80
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,404
- Give it to my mother.

81
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,840
- Alright, from here on out,
you're part of this outfit.

82
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,508
You watch everything,
you listen closely,

83
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,577
you keep your eyes open
and your ears peeled.

84
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,178
You got me? This here,

85
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,947
this is what we call a quarter.

86
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,915
You're gonna take it
to chatterton's bakery

87
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,452
and bring me back two day-old
pies: Apple and coconut-cream.

88
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,920
- Yes, sir.

89
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,926
- What do you think of him?

90
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,995
- He's a good boy.
- I think he is.

91
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,931
A couple of years underage,
that's all.

92
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,300
- Well, I'm a couple of years
overage,

93
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,202
so I think we'll get along.

94
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,105
- If you need me,
I'll be at corbett's.

95
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,808
You two can share
those pies between you.

96
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,212
What's your name again?

97
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,648
- Homer macauley.
- Homer macauley.

98
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,116
You're just the boy
this office needs.

99
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,985
I reckon you're the
fastest-moving thing

100
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,920
in this valley.

101
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:45,123
Remember, once a messenger,
always a messenger.

102
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,799
- Alright, boy, alright.

103
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,139
Homer macauley.

104
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,911
My name is William grogan.
I'm 67 years old.

105
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,347
Old-time telegrapher,
one of the last.

106
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,049
And I'm hungry.

107
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,921
And from now on,
you and I are friends.

108
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,692
Mm.

109
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,997
Here you go.

110
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:30,602
I may, on occasion,
ask you to run me an errand.

111
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,671
In the event of drunkenness,

112
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,173
I shall expect a depth
of understanding.

113
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,442
- I've got a pretty good
understanding.

114
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,312
- Do you? We'll see.

115
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,184
Every evening...

116
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:50,021
I'll count on you to see that
I'm able to perform my duties.

117
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,691
A splash of cold water
directly on the face

118
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,193
if I don't respond when shaken

119
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:59,664
and to be followed immediately
by a cup of hot black coffee

120
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,132
from corbett's across the road.

121
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,867
You know where corbett's is?
- Yes, sir.

122
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,935
Cold water, hot coffee.

123
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,037
- Excuse me.

124
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,291
Homer...

125
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,095
Do you think that this world
is gonna be a better place

126
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,863
after the war?

127
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,066
- Yes, sir.

128
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,606
- How do you like
that coconut-cream pie?

129
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,308
- Very good, sir.

130
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,282
- Homer...

131
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,821
This is your first telegram.

132
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,297
Put it in your cap.

133
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,327
- Postal telegram.
- You have a telegram?

134
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,729
- Yes, ma'am.
- For who is it?

135
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,632
- A Mrs. Rosa sandoval,
1129 g street.

136
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:51,536
Are you Mrs. sandoval?
-<i> Sí, sí, sí.</i> Please come in.

137
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,546
I cannot read English.

138
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,550
How does the telegram read?
- Ma'am?

139
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,053
- Please, open the telegram
and read to me the telegram.

140
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,557
- Yes, ma'am.

141
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,937
- Please, come inside.

142
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,265
Who sends me this telegram?
My son, Juan domingo?

143
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,103
- No, ma'am.

144
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,106
It's, uh...

145
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,043
From the secretary of war.

146
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,781
- The secretary--
- maybe it's a mistake.

147
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,717
Maybe it wasn't your son.
Maybe it was somebody else.

148
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,054
The telegram says
it was Juan domingo, but...

149
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,123
Maybe the telegram's wrong.
- Please, sit down.

150
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,125
I will bring you some candy,
okay?

151
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,394
All boys love candy very much.

152
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,531
- I can't quit. Otherwise,
I'm as good as dead myself.

153
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,406
Mr. grogan!

154
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,809
Mr. grogan.

155
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,987
Mr. grogan, there's a telegram!
They're calling you! Wake up!

156
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,090
- Ah!

157
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,399
Coffee. Corbett's!

158
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,478
- Mr. corbett, I need
a cup of coffee right now.

159
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,647
It's for Mr. grogan.
- Sure.

160
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,464
No, it's alright.
No charge, boy.

161
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,265
- Thanks.

162
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,540
- That's right, that's right,
that's right! Don't be afraid.

163
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,110
That's exactly right.
That's what I told you.

164
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,012
It's exactly right.

165
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,447
Corbett's coffee.

166
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,824
- Is it... an important
telegram?

167
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,093
- No.

168
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,462
It's most unimportant.

169
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,134
Ah, the accumulation of money,
business.

170
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,436
Seeing it takes a few weeks

171
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,405
for the important ones
to get here.

172
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,806
It's a night letter,

173
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,142
but you won't have
to deliver it tonight.

174
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,310
It's most unimportant.

175
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,513
But very important
for me to receive it.

176
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,651
They wanna... replace me.

177
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,154
They've been wanting
to retire me for years,

178
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,823
bring in machines, teletypes.

179
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,526
Machines instead
of human beings.

180
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,327
- Yes, sir.

181
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:51,536
- I knew I could count on you,
homer. I just knew it.

182
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,539
You've already been
a great help to me.

183
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,140
You know...

184
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,177
You've come to work
just in time.

185
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,353
I used to be the fastest
telegrapher in the world.

186
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,856
Faster than wolinsky.

187
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,526
Sending, receiving,
receiving, sending...

188
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,163
And no mistakes. No mistakes!

189
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,565
Yeah.

190
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,200
Willie grogan.

191
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,168
Everybody in the world,

192
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,538
every operator in the world
knew that...

193
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:33,177
Knew that name.
And I... pfft. Well...

194
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:39,383
You and me, homer,
we're still alive.

195
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,554
We are.

196
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,727
Mm. Ah...

197
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,731
<i> I should </i>
<i> like to say just a word</i>

198
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,399
<i> to the women in the country</i>
<i> tonight.</i>

199
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,035
<i> I have a boy at sea</i>
<i> on a destroyer.</i>

200
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,572
<i> For all I know, he may be</i>
<i> on his way to the pacific.</i>

201
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:05,743
<i> Two of my children are</i>
<i>in coast cities on the pacific.</i>

202
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,045
<i> Many of you</i>
<i> all over this country</i>

203
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,982
<i> have boys in the services</i>
<i> who will now be called upon</i>

204
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,750
<i> to go into action.</i>

205
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,954
<i> You have friends and families</i>
<i> in what has suddenly become</i>

206
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,589
<i> a danger zone.</i>

207
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,758
- Everything's alright, ma.

208
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,327
I don't want you to sit up
this way. Everything's alright.

209
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,308
I had to deliver a telegram...

210
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,279
To a lady over on g street.

211
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,214
It said her son's dead.

212
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,752
She wouldn't believe it.

213
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,159
And when I got back
to the office,

214
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,629
the old telegraph
operator was drunk.

215
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,966
He has to do his work,
or they'll put him on a pension.

216
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,642
- Everything's alright, homer.

217
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,978
It's only that you are becoming
aware

218
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,280
of a world
in which you've been a child.

219
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,988
- I don't know what's happening.

220
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,492
Or why.

221
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,664
But no matter what...

222
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,334
I won't let anything hurt you
that way.

223
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:49,013
<i> - Dear homer, you are now</i>
<i>the man of the macauley family.</i>

224
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,683
<i> So everything I have at home</i>
<i> is yours.</i>

225
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:56,821
<i> My books, my phonograph,</i>
<i> my microscope.</i>

226
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,524
<i> I miss you, of course,</i>

227
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:03,527
<i> and I think about you</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

228
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,064
<i> I think about our father,</i>
<i> who died so recently</i>

229
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,066
<i> and yet so long ago.</i>

230
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,370
<i> His goodness... somehow...</i>

231
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,038
<i> Still with us.</i>

232
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,049
- Ah, knock it off.

233
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:28,586
<i> - His death is not an easy</i>
<i> thing to understand.</i>

234
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,557
<i> I guess it just takes time.</i>

235
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,561
<i> Time to let it go.</i>

236
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,799
<i> And when the pain leaves...</i>

237
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:46,804
<i>I hope the rest will be lighter</i>
<i> and better than ever.</i>

238
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,476
<i> We leave for action soon.</i>

239
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,945
<i>No one knows where that may be.</i>

240
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,215
<i> I'm happy.</i>

241
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:02,219
<i> And even though</i>
<i> I wish there were no war...</i>

242
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,289
<i> I'm happy</i>
<i> to be serving my country,</i>

243
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,092
<i> which, to me, is ithaca.</i>

244
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,762
- Marcus.

245
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:15,366
So what are... so what
are mornings like back home?

246
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,135
- Mornings?

247
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,674
- What's that?

248
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:03,481
- Exercises.
- What for?

249
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:04,849
- Muscle.

250
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,917
- Gonna be the strongest man
in the world.

251
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,121
- No.
- What are you gonna be, then?

252
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:11,989
- Go back to sleep.

253
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,601
- Gonna go to school?
- Yep.

254
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,836
- Gonna learn something?

255
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,005
- I'm gonna run the
220 low hurdles someday.

256
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,673
- Why?

257
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,043
- Because everybody born in this
town wins the 220 low hurdles.

258
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,178
Marcus did,

259
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,248
the manager
of the telegraph office did

260
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,850
when he went to ithaca high.
He was valley champion.

261
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,052
- What's valley champion?

262
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:45,356
- That's the best.
- Gonna be the best?

263
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:48,025
- I'm gonna try.

264
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:56,200
- Tomorrow-- no,
yesterday I saw the train.
- How'd it go?

265
00:23:56,202 --> 00:24:00,704
- The bachmann waved.
- Did you wave back?

266
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:04,341
- He said, "going home."
Where's he going?

267
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,912
- I don't know. Everybody's got
a different home.

268
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,481
- Are you going?
- Someday.

269
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,785
- Gonna come back?
- Sure.

270
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,755
- Gonna be glad?
- Sure. Gonna be glad to see ma,

271
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:21,559
Marcus and Bess,
glad to see you.

272
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,061
- Don't go, homer, don't go.

273
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,567
- I'm not going now.
I'm just going to school.

274
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,903
- Papa went and he won't come
back, not like he used to.

275
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:38,209
Marcus went...
Don't you go too, homer.

276
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,580
- It's gonna be a long time
before I go.

277
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,115
But, for now,
it's time for you to go.

278
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,584
- Where?

279
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,819
- Back to sleep.

280
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,941
Ah!!

281
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,288
<i> I have no idea </i>
<i> what's ahead.</i>

282
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,792
<i> But whatever it is,</i>
<i> I am humbly ready for it.</i>

283
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,018
<i> - Marcus.</i>

284
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,986
<i> Marcus.</i>

285
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,624
Marcus. Marcus!

286
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,761
<i> My friend here is </i>
<i> an orphan.</i>

287
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:06,664
<i> His name is Toby George.</i>

288
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,832
<i> I've told him</i>
<i> all about our family</i>

289
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,935
<i> and someday</i>
<i> I'll bring him home.</i>

290
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,976
<i> I would rather</i>
<i> I wasn't in the army</i>

291
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,678
<i> and there was no war.</i>

292
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,280
<i> I don't hate anyone.</i>

293
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,017
<i> But I've long since made up</i>
<i> my mind</i>

294
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,853
<i> to be the best soldier</i>
<i> I can be.</i>

295
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,572
<i> More than anything else in</i>
<i> the world, I wanna come home.</i>

296
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:54,211
<i> And spend many long years with</i>
<i> you, ma and Bess and ulysses.</i>

297
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,483
<i> I wanna come back for a home</i>
<i> and a family of my own.</i>

298
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,214
<i> You are now on your way,</i>

299
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,750
<i> in a world chockfull of things</i>
<i> that...</i>

300
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,386
<i> Aren't easy to understand.</i>

301
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:38,489
<i> So, of course,</i>
<i> all the mistakes are ahead.</i>

302
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,792
<i> All the wonderful mistakes</i>
<i> that you must,</i>

303
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,961
<i> and will make.</i>

304
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,641
<i> Trust your heart,</i>
<i> which is a good one,</i>

305
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:00,678
<i> to be right, and go ahead.</i>

306
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,782
- Set!

307
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,925
No! Get off the field!

308
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,465
- Ugh!

309
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:33,677
<i> - And if you fall, tricked</i>
<i> or tripped by others,</i>

310
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,813
<i> or yourself even...</i>

311
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,981
<i> Get up.</i>

312
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,820
- Dinner with... well...
No, now wait a minute.

313
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,988
I promised?

314
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,990
When did I promise to have
dinner with your parents?

315
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,826
-<i> Come on, you remember. </i>
- Uh-huh.

316
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,627
<i> - We talked about it</i>
<i> at breakfast.</i>

317
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:54,531
<i> You remember, right, darling? </i>
- Okay, take it easy. Every...

318
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,468
Every time you call me darling,
it make me wanna--

319
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,336
-<i> what are you afraid of? </i>
- Yeah, no--

320
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,939
-<i> dinner is at 7:00 sharp. </i>
- 7:00 sharp.

321
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,207
<i> - You know how--</i>

322
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,175
- what do you mean
by sharp exactly?

323
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,344
-<i> You're a diamond!</i>
<i> Wear something right.</i>

324
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,646
- Mm-hmm.
-<i> You know, evening clothes.</i>

325
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,981
- What do you mean,
evening clothes?

326
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,983
I wear the same clothes
morning and evening Bo--

327
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,285
-<i> the clothes I got you. </i>
- No, no, alright.

328
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,387
<i> - I love you.</i>

329
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,860
<i> And I know you love me, too.</i>

330
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,962
- Yes, I do.

331
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,197
Okay. No. Goodbye.

332
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,206
I have been out to dinner
two times in my life and...

333
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,742
I was scared to death
both times.

334
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,644
I had no fun at all.

335
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:44,748
- Mr. Spangler,
I'm sorry I'm running late.

336
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,216
- Hi, homer.
- Hey, homer.

337
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,418
- Ulysses,
what are you doing here?

338
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,088
- Oh... ulysses, huh?
That makes sense.

339
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,223
This little fella, he just
walks in right off the street,

340
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,559
plops himself down,
listens to my phone calls.

341
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,861
Fearless, that's what you are.
You are a fearless young man

342
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,129
and you're an excellent
listener, too.

343
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,497
What is happening?

344
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,066
Are you limping over there?
Are you okay?

345
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,868
- Yes, sir.

346
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,805
- Okay, then. A few telegrams
have piled up and a few pickups.

347
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,106
You do the pickups first,

348
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,707
then deliver the telegrams
afterwards.

349
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:14,444
- Yes, sir, right away.
I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

350
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,413
- Ah, that's alright.

351
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,453
Don't worry, we'll keep
an eye on your brother for you.

352
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,888
You just... you go ahead.

353
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,092
- Yeah, you go ahead, homer.

354
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,834
- Willie, I'm going over
to corbett's for a drink.

355
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:41,438
I am having dinner tonight
with Diana and her parents,

356
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,276
and I feel the need
for a little... fortification.

357
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,847
- Well, ulysses and me can hold
down the fort while you're gone.

358
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,482
Can we? You think? Yep.

359
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:55,352
Get the good wine
ready for pickup.

360
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,121
- Oh, when homer comes back,
you two keep him here

361
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,290
until sunripe growers calls
for their pickup.

362
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:03,327
Listen, your brother has beaten
western union to sunripe growers

363
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,329
twice in the last two days.
How many'd he get yesterday?

364
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:08,465
- Uh... 67.
- Sixty-seven.

365
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,501
He beats them again, we might
have a good month after all.

366
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,203
I'll be back. One drink.

367
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,472
- Oh, that's sunripe now,
ready for pickup.

368
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,210
- I'll do the pickup, Willie.
How do you like that?

369
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,478
- You?

370
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,147
- Yes, me. If homer can beat
western union, so can I.

371
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,450
And I'm gonna do it on foot!
- Hmm.

372
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,521
- Sam. Hannah.

373
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,495
Hi, boys!

374
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,542
You! Are the loveliest woman
in the world.

375
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,058
Heya, Harry.

376
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,360
Postal telegraph! Stan.

377
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,364
- What on earth?

378
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,367
- Once a messenger, always
a messenger, Mrs. brockington.

379
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,537
- I declare, you're never gonna
grow up, tom Spangler.

380
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,206
- Hope not.
- Beaten again, Harry.

381
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,208
- Ah, poor Harry.

382
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,579
- Here it is, 129 night letters,
all paid.

383
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:33,317
- Oh! Thank you.

384
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,921
Here you go, Harry. Hate for you
to go back to western union

385
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,389
with nothing to send.

386
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,067
How is it, Ralph?

387
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:53,236
- Oh, not bad, not good.

388
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,238
- Not bad, not good.

389
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,410
I buy them three to their one.

390
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,412
When they're broke
and ready to go,

391
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,815
I'll give them their money back.
- You afford that?

392
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,583
- No.

393
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,589
- Ah, something eatin' you,
Ralph?

394
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,060
- Maybe.

395
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,667
You know old Dutch here...

396
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,937
Would've been 45 years old
today.

397
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,339
Can you imagine that?
- Is that so?

398
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,541
- Hey. Hey, screwball, give us
another couple of drinks.

399
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:34,444
- We're just catching up.
He'll be right with you, friend.

400
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,281
- The war to end wars, right,
tom?

401
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,817
- That's what they told us.

402
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,619
That's what they said.

403
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:46,990
- Hey, pal, I asked you
for a couple of drinks.

404
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,158
- Yeah.

405
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,694
- What are you gonna do
about it?

406
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,631
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey!

407
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,600
- Do you know
who you're talking to?

408
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,635
- Ralphie.
- I didn't mean nothin' by it.

409
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,937
- You got no idea.
- It's okay.

410
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:04,007
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

411
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,609
Just... like you were.
As you were.

412
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,644
- You go on, miss.
- It's gonna be fine.

413
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,846
- You don't wanna be
with this guy.

414
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,481
- Here, here.

415
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,819
Good luck, soldier.

416
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,161
Come on, it's alright, pal.
- No, it ain't.

417
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,196
I'm scared, tom.

418
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:31,501
- Well, nowadays...
We're all scared.

419
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,674
Uh... Diana, she...
She's getting impatient.

420
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:41,678
She's having me have dinner
tonight with her parents.

421
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,780
You wanna talk about scared.

422
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:51,054
- I didn't think it'd ever
happen again, tom.

423
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,756
But no wonder, huh?

424
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,227
The fightin's... inside us.

425
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,530
It's inside of me.

426
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,569
It's what we are.
Till we ain't.

427
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,558
- Can I have another?

428
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,399
Gentlemen...

429
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,337
- You got sunripe, Mr. Spangler?

430
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,106
- I surely did.
129, give or take a handful.

431
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,642
- How'd you get there first?
- I ran!

432
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,878
- You beat western union
to sunripe running?

433
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,579
- Nothing to it.

434
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:53,717
- Yeah, it's a shame that
you got lost on the way back.

435
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,052
- What do you say you take
ulysses here on home now?

436
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,223
- We got a pickup
from guggenheim's.

437
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,759
That's down our way,
so I'll hike ulysses home,

438
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:06,363
go to guggenheim's,
then ithaca wine, then foley's.

439
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:09,132
Come on.
I'll be back in no time.

440
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,934
- I know you will.

441
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,938
- Bye-bye.

442
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,729
- It's just thunder.
That doesn't scare you, right?

443
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:43,833
- No, nothing scares me.
Go faster, homer.

444
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,578
<i> Pay attention, homer.</i>

445
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,517
<i> Look around at this wonderful,</i>
<i> senseless yet beautiful world.</i>

446
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,988
<i> And feel compassion</i>
<i> for all things.</i>

447
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,662
<i> And their terrible way</i>
<i> of enduring... and dying.</i>

448
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,001
<i> Helpless...</i>

449
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:21,238
<i>And full of the world to come. </i>

450
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,015
- Guess we're on our way.

451
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,517
Scuttlebutt's we leave
first thing in the morning.

452
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,520
- Yeah?
What do you think about, Toby?

453
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,889
What... what do you wanna
go back to?

454
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,358
- Uh, anything... I guess.

455
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,793
I don't have a girl like Mary
waiting for me,

456
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:44,894
sister like Bess.

457
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,696
Hell, I didn't even know
kids had parents

458
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,232
till I went to school and
heard the kids talk about them.

459
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,700
So whatever I go back to,

460
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:54,037
it'll be a place,
but it won't be people.

461
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,708
I'd like to think that I could
go back to ithaca with you.

462
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,379
- You will.

463
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,381
- What do you think about?

464
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,051
- I think about my father.

465
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,255
- Matthew macauley.
- Yeah. That's right.

466
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:16,893
- Yes.
- Uh, he worked in the orchards.

467
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:20,563
Just... plain, ordinary,
everyday work.

468
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,099
Never made any more money
than we needed.

469
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,134
Ever.

470
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,270
But he did save enough money

471
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,406
to make a down payment
on a piano.

472
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:32,075
My mother wanted that for Bess.

473
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,447
There are still men in the world
like that, Toby.

474
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,751
- Tell me about Bess.

475
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,421
- You wanna know about Bess?

476
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,924
You are in luck.
- Got a picture in your pocket?

477
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,893
- Yeah, I'm my pocket.

478
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,774
- Hi, Bess.
- Hello, Mr. grogan.

479
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,144
- A little wet, huh?
- This is my friend Mary.

480
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,447
- Pleased to meet you, Mary.

481
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,415
- We're just on our way
to the majestic.

482
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,951
And here's homer's supper.
- We're going to the pictures.

483
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:19,322
- Oh. I'll see he gets it.

484
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:22,459
- Oh. Uh... hello.
- Hello.

485
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,327
- Hello.
- Uh, ma'am.

486
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,462
- Hi!

487
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,063
- May I help you gentlemen?

488
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:30,867
- Uh, yeah, um... how much is
a telegram to New Jersey?

489
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,070
- Well, it's 25 words
for 50 cents,

490
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,005
plus a small tax and...

491
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:39,342
We don't count the address
or the signature.

492
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,344
- Alright, 50 cents,
that's not bad.

493
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,813
Uh, how much to San Antonio?

494
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:47,083
- Uh, half as much as, uh,
Jersey.

495
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,818
- That makes a lot of sense.

496
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,987
- So half of 50 cents,
that would make it--

497
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,355
- a quarter.
- 25 cents.

498
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,656
- Thank you.
- Alright, great.

499
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,892
- Here you go, sir.
Ooh, there it is.

500
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,293
- Huh?

501
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,996
- You're gonna have to pardon
my, uh, pal fat here.

502
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,499
He's just, uh, he's just
homesick something awful.

503
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,667
- It's not my name, no.
- Dude.

504
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,136
- You see, ma'am,

505
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,172
fat here and I, we're shipping
out tomorrow

506
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,841
and he's just a little nervous,
that's all.

507
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,544
- It's not my name. At all.
- Box.

508
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:17,380
Box? B-o-c... b-o-c-k-s?

509
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,048
- Uh, yeah, c-k-s.

510
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,151
- Of... of dried figs.

511
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:23,386
Dried figs.

512
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,888
- Yes, f-i-g-g-s.

513
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,790
- We were gonna go
to the picture show

514
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:29,259
and we were wondering if-if...

515
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,394
Well, if you wanted...

516
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,997
If you wanted to maybe come
with... if you wanted to come.

517
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,498
- Yeah, there's gonna be
a cartoon, I hear.

518
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,133
The cartoon's my favorite part.
- Sure.

519
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,202
- You would? We're going
to the pictures with 'em.

520
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:43,072
- Okay, hold on just one second.
- Don't worry about nothing.

521
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,307
- Love, Bernard.

522
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,942
- You're done. After you.

523
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,479
- I got it. I'll get the door.
- I'll get the door!

524
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,918
<i> The greatest </i>
<i> double-cross in history.</i>

525
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,086
<i> Jap envoys talk peace</i>
<i> in Washington.</i>

526
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,223
<i> Jap planes, without warning,</i>
<i> bring war to America.</i>

527
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,259
<i> Our great pacific outpost</i>

528
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,361
<i> is ruthlessly bombed</i>

529
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,330
<i> as Japan's perfidious</i>

530
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:10,867
<i>Death and destruction unleashed</i>
<i> on a nation at peace.</i>

531
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,469
<i> On that fateful</i>
<i> Sunday morning,</i>

532
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,405
<i> when this country was</i>

533
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:16,706

00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,042
<i> A nation,</i>

00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:23,913
<i> like a person,</i>

536

<i> something more permanent,</i>

537
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:32,922
<i> something larger than</i>

538
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:38,761
<i> It is that something which</i>
<i> matters most to its future.</i>

539
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,106
- It's yours.
- Huh?

540
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,977
- Here, take it.

541
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,861
- Your sister Bess brought
your supper by.

542
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,737
She was with a girl,
a very pretty girl.

543
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,209
- Is it an important telegram?

544
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,754
That's Mary, our neighbor.

545
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,790
She's Marcus's girl.

546
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,412
I was gonna get us two pies,
but there's plenty here.

547
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,915
Will you share with me?

548
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,418
- Oh, no, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

549
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,523
- Maybe if you...

550
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:23,259
Started to eat a little,
your appetite will improve.

551
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,629
- Yeah.

552
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,932
We... we do have raincoats,
you know.

553
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,436
- Yeah.

554
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,806
I know.

555
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,477
I just...
Got caught in the rain.

556
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,822
They don't just... die
for nothing, do they?

557
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,363
- Well, I can't answer
that question, son.

558
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,470
I'm not sure
there is an answer to that.

559
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:14,477
It's a very young question.
I'm an old man.

560
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:22,485
Just try not to live in fear,
homer.

561
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,835
Would you run upstairs
and get my pills for me?

562
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,937
- Yes, sir.

563
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:15,404
- Ah, thank you, boy. Thank you.

564
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:17,306
- Yes, sir.

565
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,212
- Wait!

566
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,382
What's the matter?

567
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:41,817
- I'm sorry.

568
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:46,022
I've got a telegram
for Mrs. Claudia beaufrere.

569
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:49,191
- Of course you do.
It's her birthday.

570
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:52,929
Mother!
There's a telegram for you.

571
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,197
It's from Alan, I'm sure.

572
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,366
Come in, young man.

573
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,208
Just a moment.

574
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,431
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

575
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,766
- May I offer you some punch?
- No, thanks.

576
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:34,036
- Wait right here, I'll just go
get my change purse.

577
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:35,571
- There's no need.

578
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,250
I'll just...

579
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,755
I have to go back now...
To the office.

580
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,325
- Please...

581
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,994
Wait.

582
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,783
- Mother!

583
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:37,299
- Thanks. Thank you.

584
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:40,302
- So, uh... did you like it?
- Yeah, it was great.

585
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:43,305
- It was good, it was good.
- The cartoon was great.

586
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,841
- Yeah.
- Well, we need to go home now.

587
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:49,979
- Oh... well, uh... thank you.

588
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:52,048
- For what?

589
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,817
- I'm very fond of you.

590
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,198
- Think I could steal one too?

591
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,667
I'm shipping out tomorrow,
as well.

592
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,346
<i> Try to remember...</i>

593
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:27,249
<i> That none of us</i>
<i> is separate from each other.</i>

594
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,219
<i> He is ours.</i>

595
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:34,090
<i> And we... are his.</i>

596
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,691
- Come on, Bess.

597
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,365
- Bye.
- Whoo-wee!

598
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:48,571
- How you talk, boy!
- Oh man! Oh, man!

599
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,576
- Smooth! Silky smooth.

600
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,546
- Hoo!
- Ah.

601
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:04,386
<i> The world's gone mad, </i>
<i> homer.</i>

602
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,438
- What's the matter
with your leg, boy?

603
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:01,443
- It's nothin'. I guess I...

604
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:04,613
...twisted a ligament
or something.

605
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:07,283
I was running
the 220 low hurdles.

606
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,952
- Hmm.
- And, uh...

607
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,823
...it's all confused.

608
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,825
Everything's...

609
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,561
Changed out there.

610
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:23,632
I guess I'll rub some liniment
on it tonight or something.

611
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,802
- Yeah, that might be good.

612
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,807
You've changed, you know.

613
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,911
In the week or so you came
to work, you've changed.

614
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,649
- Yeah.

615
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:49,325
I didn't know anything
before I got this job.

616
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:52,461
I don't like the way things are.

617
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:55,664
I just want things to be better.

618
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,935
How can any man
ever get it all straight

619
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:03,005
so that it comes out even
and makes sense?

620
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,508
Everything's so...

621
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,311
Sad or mixed up...

622
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:10,980
And wrong.

623
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,882
And...

624
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,752
I don't even care if Helen eliot
doesn't like me anymore.

625
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,822
Sure, I wish she... would,
but if she doesn't, that's okay.

626
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,860
Yeah, something's the matter
with it.

627
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,872
It's five after 12.

628
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,410
I guess I'll go home now.

629
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,715
Tomorrow's Saturday.

630
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,054
Saturdays used
to be my best day.

631
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,728
You sure you wouldn't like
a sandwich now?

632
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,097
- Yeah, I'll have a sandwich.

633
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,899
Changed my mind.

634
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,571
Please...
Thank your mother for me.

635
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:11,807
- Nah, it's nothing.

636
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,409
- No!

637
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,244
It's somethin'.

638
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:17,446
Thank her.
Please thank her for me.

639
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,214
- Yes, sir.

640
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:21,517
- You do love me, don't you?

641
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,485
I know that you do.

642
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,755
You do love me, don't you?
I know that you do.

643
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,994
What do you think about...
What do you think about a woman

644
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:35,064
who says to you:
"You do love me, don't you?

645
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:37,099
I know that you do."

646
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:44,073
- That you'd be a fool
to let her get away.

647
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,113
- What do you think
of that new messenger?

648
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,121
- He's the best I ever seen.

649
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:42,030
- Stop! Wait! Don't go!
Don't go there!

650
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,166
Leave them alone!

651
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:46,368
Dad!

652
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,671
Don't go!

653
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:52,174
We will sing one song.

654
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,577
- No!!

655
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,514
- Homer. Alright, lie down.

656
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,749
- Oh...
- Oh...

657
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,820
It's alright.

658
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:11,693
He's alright, ulysses.
Go back to sleep.

659
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,817
- It's Marcus.

660
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,115
- Ma?

661
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,787
Ma?
- Yes, homer.

662
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,023
- I never cried
when I was little.

663
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,994
Even ulysses never cries.

664
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,864
Because, well, what's the use?

665
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:03,438
I thought a fellow would never
cry when he got to be grown up.

666
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,174
'Cause that's when you start
finding out about things.

667
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,681
- There will always be pain
in this world, homer.

668
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:18,987
And a good man will seek
to take the pain out of things.

669
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,523
- Mrs. macauley,
ulysses and me have already been

670
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:23,158
to Mr. Henderson's tree

671
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,394
with auggie, Enoch, shag,
nickie and alf,

672
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,162
but the apples aren't ripe.

673
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:30,532
- Well of course they're not,
Lionel. They need more time.

674
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,634
- Well,
they're gonna play football now,

675
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:35,304
and ulysses's too small,
and ulysses and me,

676
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:37,739
we're partners
and I wanna ask permission

677
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,208
to take ulysses
to the public library.

678
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,010
- You have my permission.

679
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:51,019
- Was Marcus like ulysses
when he was little?

680
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:53,188
- In what way?

681
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,824
- Fearless.

682
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,393
- Well,
ulysses is like his father.

683
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,696
Except...

684
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:03,699
No one is fearless.

685
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,302
- I wish I could be
like ulysses.

686
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,419
You know, ma, you're just about
the most wonderful person

687
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,988
anyone could ever know.

688
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,225
There goes auggie.

689
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,095
Another touchdown.

690
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,871
I'm gonna go
to the telegraph office.

691
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:46,241
I told them I'd come,
just in case they needed me.

692
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:51,046
Oh, and Mr. grogan,
he ate one of the sandwiches.

693
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:52,781
He told me
to tell you thank you.

694
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:55,884
So thanks, ma, from Mr. grogan.

695
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,457
- Katie.

696
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,963
Katie?

697
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,278
- Yes, Matthew?

698
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,197
- Katie.

699
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,503
- Yes.

700
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,525
- Marcus?

701
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,230
Marcus?

702
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,532
You okay?

703
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,036
- Yeah.

704
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,743
- So, uh...

705
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:03,545
So, ulysses...

706
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:05,113
What's he like?

707
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,751
- Let me tell you about him.

708
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,236
- Hi, homer!

709
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,072
Homer's going to work.

710
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,443
Homer's going to work!

711
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,410
: Okay, in a minute!

712
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,013
Saved by the bell.

713
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,118
- So, uh... thank you, Lily,

714
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,520
and... I'll be seeing you.

715
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,122
- Mm-hmm.

716
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:59,127
- Telegram for Dolly hawthorne?

717
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,696
- Oh, she's out. I can take it.

718
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,032
Hold on a minute, will you?

719
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,241
Boy, would you come here
a minute, please?

720
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,715
Oh. Would you mail this letter
for me?

721
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:23,952
It's very important.
It's my sister.

722
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,987
Send it air mail,

723
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,789
special delivery, registered.

724
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:31,526
There's money in it.
Um... I haven't got any stamps.

725
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:34,029
Would you do this for me?

726
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:36,197
- Yes, ma'am.
- Here is a dollar.

727
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,832
Put the letter in your hat,

728
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:41,236
don't let anybody see it,
and don't tell anybody.

729
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:43,972
- I won't tell anybody.
I'll do it right now.

730
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:45,573
I'll bring you your change.

731
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,208
- No!

732
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,711
Don't come back here.

733
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,532
- No, it can't be.

734
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:13,168
It's a machine!

735
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,704
- I don't think so, auggie.
- I don't know.

736
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:19,107
- No, auggie's right.
It's a machine. I'm telling you.

737
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,376
- Ah, lookit!

738
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:33,621
- It's a man.
- Oh, what do you know, Lionel?

739
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:15,463
: Marcus?

740
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:28,276
- You okay?
Come on, ulysses,

741
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,711
let's go home.

742
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,414
We've seen him
go through all the cards.

743
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,718
I'm going, ulysses.

744
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,273
- Papa, mama!

745
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,344
Ma!

746
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,352
- He got lost, ma.

747
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:14,823
Auggie found him and brought him
to the telegraph office.

748
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,794
- Thanks, homer.

749
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:23,231
- Careful, there's a busted egg
in his pocket.

750
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,451
<i> Homer.</i>

751
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,920
<i> I've never believed in wars.</i>

752
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:48,890
<i> I know them to be foolish,</i>
<i> even when they're necessary.</i>

753
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:52,894
<i> I'm glad that I'm the macauley</i>
<i> who is in this war,</i>

754
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:57,332
<i> for it'd be a pity</i>
<i> and a mistake if it were you.</i>

755
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:02,570
<i>I can write to you what I would</i>
<i> never say in person.</i>

756
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:06,007
<i> You are the best</i>
<i> of the macauleys.</i>

757
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:08,376
<i> You must go on being the best.</i>

758
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:15,416
<i> You must live in the years</i>
<i> of your life forever.</i>

759
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:17,519
<i> You are</i>
<i> what we are fighting for.</i>

760
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,525
<i> Yes, you, my brother.</i>

761
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:30,131
- "Now I'll write your name here
to remind you, homer macauley,

762
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:31,933
"that's who you are.

763
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,436
"I miss you very much.

764
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,273
"I can't wait
until I see you again.

765
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,943
"God bless you.

766
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,613
"So long, your brother,

767
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:47,448
Marcus."

768
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,529
If my brother...

769
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,366
Is killed in this stupid war,

770
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,335
I'll spit at the world.

771
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,170
I'll hate it forever.
I won't be good.

772
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:12,473
I'll be the worst of them all,
the worst that's ever lived.

773
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,375
- Uh, you be grateful
for yourself.

774
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,977
You... be thankful.

775
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,546
That's what your brother's
trying to tell you.

776
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,282
- Mr. grogan, are you drunk?

777
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:26,754
- Yeah... I'm a little drunk.
I feel better when I'm drunk.

778
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:29,324
I probably wouldn't be telling
you the things I'm telling you

779
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:31,125
if I wasn't drunk!

780
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,827
You're a man, homer!

781
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:35,663
Fourteen years old
and you're a man!

782
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:38,800
Now who knows who made you
such a thing.

783
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:43,438
I don't know, you don't know.
But it's true!

784
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,040
Know that it's true!

785
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,675
You understand me?

786
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,079
- Hello, Lionel.
Going to see the movie?

787
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:27,849
- Haven't got any money.
- Why are you standing in line?

788
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:30,051
- Me, auggie, Enoch, shag,
nickie and alf

789
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:33,288
went out to the jailhouse
to talk to the criminals,

790
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:36,691
but then shag chased me away.
I don't know where to go.

791
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:38,860
- Well, do you wanna see
the movie?

792
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:40,561
- No.

793
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,265
- Come on with us.
We're only taking a walk around.

794
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,767
The sun's going down.

795
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:48,436
- Come on with us, Lionel.
- Okay.

796
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:53,741
Thanks. I sure was getting
tired standing there.

797
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,610
Stop it, ulysses!

798
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:31,813
- Hey, come on now.
- Stop it!

799
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:33,715
- I'm gonna say hello
to Mr. grogan.

800
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:36,451
I'll catch up.
- Homer?

801
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:57,038
- It's me, Mr. grogan.
I'll hurry and get the coffee.

802
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,642
Coffee!

803
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:04,078
- Oh, I'm cooking a new pot
right now, homer.

804
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,881
It'll be just a minute.
- You don't have any?

805
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,424
- There'll be coffee
in a minute.

806
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,526
Mr. corbett's making a...

807
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:22,997
Mr. grogan?

808
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:26,834
What's the matter?

809
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,192
- What's the matter, homer?
What's wrong with the old man?

810
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:54,395
- He's dead.
- Oh, you're crazy.

811
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:55,863
- No.

812
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,201
He's dead.

813
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,709
- Auggie?

814
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:10,611
- Uh, it's Mr. grogan.

815
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,880
Homer says he's dead.

816
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:38,072
- I'll stop that.

817
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,578
Auggie?

818
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,147
Um, I want you to go over
to corbett's.

819
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,949
Alright?

820
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,752
Um, you have them telephone...

821
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,555
...dr. Nelson.

822
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:32,093
His number's 1133.
He'll take care of everything.

823
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:34,161
Okay, have him come
right on over here,

824
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:36,264
and then also have him telephone
Harry Burke.

825
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:38,099
He's the other
telegraph operator.

826
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:41,502
And you have them both
come down here, okay?

827
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:43,304
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, auggie.

828
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,047
: Hi, homer.

829
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:09,390
- Willie always said he wanted
to work until the day he died.

830
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,861
You gotta believe your brother
isn't gone,

831
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:15,796
he's still inside you,
he's inside--

832
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:19,066
- no! That isn't good enough!

833
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,236
I want to see him!

834
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,805
I wanna smell him.

835
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,907
I wanna hear his voice,

836
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:30,077
hear him laughing
and have fights with him!

837
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,647
Everything's different now.

838
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,084
And this place...

839
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,620
Everything in ithaca
has changed,

840
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:44,825
because my brother isn't gonna
look at anything anymore!

841
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:51,298
My brother's dead.

842
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,101
- Right, okay.

843
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:57,238
I'm not... I'm not gonna try
and comfort you.

844
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,977
I can't.

845
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,351
But just try to believe...

846
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,956
...that the best part
of a good man stays.

847
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:22,196
It stays forever.

848
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,184
- They'll know.

849
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,322
They'll know
the minute they see me.

850
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:52,159
- Well, I can sit with you
for while, if you like.

851
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,000
- I have to go now.

852
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,222
- Ma, somebody's...

853
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,092
There's a soldier outside.

854
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,434
Well, go on out to him, honey.

855
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,111
- Hello.

856
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,315
- Bess?

857
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,384

Do you know my brother Marcus?
