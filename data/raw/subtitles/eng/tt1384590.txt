01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,909
Jordan, can you hear me?

702
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,202
Come in, Jordan.

703
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,164
Where are you?

704
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,167
Falling. I forgot my chute.

705
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:41,939
Very creative.

706
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,775
Hey, I got a few tricks too.

707
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,702
APPA ALI APSA: Though we continue
to mourn those who have fallen...

708
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,872
...during the tragic betrayal
of recent days...

709
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,959
...we also celebrate our resiliency.

710
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:05,963
Our battery is repaired,
our rings replenished...

711
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:09,425
...and our battle
against the dark forces continues.

712
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:12,804
If we have learned anything
from our last battle...

713
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:17,934
...it is that great evil can arise
from the most unexpected sources...

714
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:22,730
...but, most thankfully,
so can great heroism.

715
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,443
I've asked Ganthet
to lead us in our pledge.

716
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,821
If you don't mind, Appa Ali Apsa...

717
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:34,242
...I'd like to give that privilege
to our newest Lantern, Hal Jordan.

718
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:37,954
Hear, hear.

719
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,498
What's the matter?

720
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,000
I just learned the thing this morning.

721
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,841
HAL:
In brightest day--

722
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:55,179
ALL: In blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

723
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,307
Let those who worship evil's might...

724
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:03,312
...beware my power,
Green Lantern's light!

725
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,487
I'm off.

726
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:12,989
Where are you going?

727
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,658
I've gotta go punch a clock
with my other boss.

728
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:19,036
I can see where this is gonna be
a long commute.

729
