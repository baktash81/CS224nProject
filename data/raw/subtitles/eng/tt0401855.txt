1
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,757
My God.
Brother, what have you done?

2
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,528
Yet again we arrive to witness
this monster's aftermath.

3
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,700
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

4
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,119
Your brother must be stopped.

5
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,371
It ends tonight.

6
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,041
We must move quickly,
before they turn.

7
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,796
Is he still here?

8
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,881
Yes.

9
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,884
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

10
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,220
I gave you my word, did I not?

11
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,306
But William must be controlled.

12
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,853
Burn the bodies.

13
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,980
Search the outbuildings.

14
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,149
Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

15
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,817
- Yes, sir.
- Marcus.

16
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,653
Stay with me.

17
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,987
Give me the torch.

18
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:26,580
They're turning!

19
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,220
- Retreat to the woods.
- I'll stay and fight. You need my help.

20
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,139
I need you alive.

21
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,640
If you die, we all die.

22
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,975
Now, go.

23
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,019
Go!

24
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,629
- We found him.
- And?

25
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,340
- We need more men.
- Find Amelia.

26
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,643
Amelia, we found William.

27
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,796
Surround him!

28
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,676
Take him down.

29
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,352
No.

30
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,148
Leave him be.

31
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,278
Stop this, you're killing him.

32
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,824
More!

33
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,725
William.

34
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,185
Marcus!

35
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,563
He was not to be harmed.

36
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,066
Place him in my charge
as we agreed...

37
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,234
...or you will pay for your deceit.

38
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,112
And you will learn your place.

39
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,282
Your sympathy for this beast
is foolish.

40
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,243
Your brother is entirely
beyond control.

41
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,995
It will be done my way.

42
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,666
You know well the consequences
if you murder me...

43
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,084
...or William.

44
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,712
If you so much as speak
his name again...

45
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,298
...you will have chosen
that future for him.

46
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,769
What is thy will, my lord?

47
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,981
Lmprisonment for all time.

48
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,443
Far from you.

49
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,499
For six centuries I was a loyal soldier
of the Vampire clan.

50
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,712
But I was betrayed.

51
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,258
The war was not as it had seemed.

52
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:34,304
In one night, the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed.

53
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,266
Kraven, our second-in-command...

54
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,935
...had formed a secret alliance
with Lucian...

55
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,146
...ruler of the Werewolf clan...

56
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,857
...to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

57
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,361
But Kraven's lust for power
and domination had failed.

58
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,867
Viktor was not the savior
I had been led to believe.

59
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,455
He had betrayed us all.

60
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,631
Soon the hunt will be on
for his killer.

61
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,888
I have but one ally left:

62
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,681
Michael...

63
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,517
...the human descendant
of Corvinus.

64
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,771
Neither Vampire nor Lycan...

65
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,773
...but a hybrid.

66
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,111
Is only a matter of time
before we're found.

67
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,720
My only hope now
is to awaken Marcus...

68
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,306
...our last remaining elder...

69
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,183
...and expose the truth...

70
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,813
...before Kraven tries to murder him
while he's still in hibernation.

71
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,026
Kraven knows
he's no match for him awake.

72
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,065
Perfect.

73
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,517
This thing's been dead for weeks.

74
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,395
I thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

75
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,106
They do. Is been given
a serum to stop regression...

76
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,108
...so it can be studied.

77
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,485
How can you tell?

78
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,370
Not quite your department, I guess.

79
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,956
I just killed them. I didn't pay
much attention to their anatomy.

80
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,251
- How long can we stay here?
- Not long.

81
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,962
These safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe...

82
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,715
...with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active.

83
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,259
Someone could have
picked us up already.

84
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,478
There's only about an hour
till daylight.

85
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,106
Can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise?

86
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,983
- Just.
- Okay, les get what we need and go.

87
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,152
No.

88
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm going alone.

89
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,260
Open it.

90
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,908
Marcus?

91
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:32,955
The blood memories
of this wretched creature...

92
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:39,253
...have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds.

93
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,090
My lord, I can explain.

94
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,802
Why would I listen to your lies...

95
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,930
...when the journey to the truth...

96
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,395
...is so much sweeter?

97
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,947
I kept his secrets,
cleaned up the mess.

98
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,283
You'll go before Viktor...

99
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,827
...and tell him
exactly what I tell you to!

100
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,581
You just concentrate on your part.

101
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,217
Please.

102
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,346
I can assist you.

103
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,723
Oh, you already have.

104
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,981
If I can plead my case...

105
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,275
...there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

106
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,362
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.
I'm not prepared to risk it.

107
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,946
What am I supposed to do, wait?

108
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,824
Kraven may still have men with him.
You're not going alone.

109
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,868
You're not as strong
as you might think.

110
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,704
- What?
- Michael, you're unique.

111
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,915
There's never been a hybrid before.

112
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,710
However ambivalent you feel about it,
your powers could be limitless.

113
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,128
But you depend on blood.

114
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,422
You need to feed.

115
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,176
Without it, you'll be growing weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

116
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,387
Jesus Christ.

117
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,139
And what if I don't?

118
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,849
What if I can't?

119
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,935
Normal food could be lethal.

120
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,938
If you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

121
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,274
And believe me, you don't want that
on your conscience.

122
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,902
There really is
no going back, Michael.

123
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,198
I'm sorry.

124
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,826
Look, I understand what you did.

125
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,786
I'm grateful.

126
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,956
You saved my life.

127
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,833
I wasn't ready to die.

128
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,423
I don't know.

129
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,757
Everything's changed.

130
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,677
I probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

131
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,971
Is a lot to process all at once.

132
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,851
Look, go. I'll be here.

133
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,937
You just make sure you come back.

134
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,440
Sir.

135
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,068
The innocent who witnessed...

136
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,569
...they've been silenced?

137
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,322
But otherwise unharmed,
as ordered.

138
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,121
- Show me what you have.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,044
Two Death Dealers were killed.

140
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,088
We found no Lycan bodies.

141
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,716
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition...

142
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,843
...some sort of UV round.

143
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,137
Amelia?

144
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,141
No one survived.

145
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,727
It seems Kraven's men
might have been present...

146
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,730
...but they did nothing to prevent it.

147
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,773
And Viktor?

148
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,297
And no trace of Marcus
amongst the ashes?

149
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,216
It seems he destroyed
his own coven, sir.

150
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,595
It was never his coven.

151
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,746
We need to go.

152
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,333
Give me a moment.

153
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,598
There you are.

154
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,454
How you doing?

155
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,394
Thank you.

156
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,811
You've got to get away from me.

157
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,647
Get away from me!

158
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,161
Hello?

159
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,835
There.

160
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,339
Michael Corvin.

161
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,840
Get the men up there. Now.

162
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,353
Get the fuck away from me.

163
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,880
Stop. Stop.

164
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,887
Shit.

165
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,851
Michael. Oh, shit.

166
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,528
- Here. Take it.
- No.

167
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,780
Michael, you'll die.

168
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,141
Shit.

169
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,184
Can you move?

170
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,815
We need to go.

171
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,004
Marcus.

172
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,673
I know what you've done, Selene.

173
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:02,801
Viktor deserved his fate
and Kraven was no better.

174
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:08,140
Kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds.

175
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,142
And Viktor...

176
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,020
Viktor deserved his fate...

177
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,605
...many times over.

178
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,233
A terrible business...

179
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,277
...the slaying of your family.

180
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,489
Yet so much effort was spent...

181
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,949
...to conceal this matter from me.

182
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,163
What do you suppose
Viktor had to hide?

183
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,417
Or perhaps it is you, Selene...

184
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:41,090
...as the last
of your wretched family...

185
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,134
...who has something to hide.

186
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,187
Go!

187
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,890
Get in.

188
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:43,462
Dead or alive,
you will give me what I want.

189
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,203
You okay?

190
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,376
- He's a hybrid, isn't he?
- Yes.

191
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:07,838
He wanted this. Why?

192
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,632
I don't know.

193
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,010
But we have another problem.

194
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,433
Turn off up here.

195
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,232
Shit. All right, get down.

196
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,319
Keep your foot on the gas,
but stay down.

197
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,920
Hold on.

198
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,269
Stay down.

199
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,367
Come on.

200
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,428
Give me your hand.

201
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,138
Jesus Christ.

202
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,600
There's really no need.

203
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,435
I'll be right back.

204
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,328
All right, let me see.

205
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,876
See?

206
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,670
No need.

207
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,066
Area secure, sir.

208
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,196
Sun's setting.

209
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,616
Whas wrong?

210
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,251
The supplies were taken.
Used weapons were left behind.

211
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:27,796
The tavern events occurred before
dawn, so they couldn't have got far.

212
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,758
Remain airborne for the moment.
I'm sure they'll reappear...

213
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:33,552
...in good time.
- Yes, sir.

214
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:40,684
I've seen this before,
when I was a child.

215
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:42,436
I've held it.

216
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,146
When it was open, like this.

217
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,564
How is that possible?

218
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,568
I don't know.

219
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:53,489
But I know someone that might.

220
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,200
Andreas Tanis.

221
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:59,244
He was the official historian
of the covens.

222
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:05,501
He fell from favor after documenting
what Viktor considered malicious lies.

223
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,420
Of course, as it turns out,
he was probably telling the truth.

224
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:09,922
What happened to him?

225
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,216
He was exiled over 300 years ago.

226
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:14,343
Three hundred years?

227
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,303
What makes you think
we'll find him now?

228
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,138
I was the one who exiled him.

229
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:59,263
Looks like a monastery.

230
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,515
It used to be.
More like a prison now.

231
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,601
Tanis has been hiding there
since Viktor's order.

232
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:07,354
We'll be the first people
he's seen in centuries.

233
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:21,326
- Thas odd.
- What?

234
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,496
I don't remember this gate
being here before.

235
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,125
Take this.

236
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,900
Shit.

237
00:45:58,508 --> 00:45:59,675
Go back!

238
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:03,345
Gotcha.

239
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,433
Fuck.

240
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:43,756
I knew it was you, Selene.

241
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:47,509
The stench of Viktor's blood
still lingers in your veins.

242
00:48:47,677 --> 00:48:49,178
Tanis.

243
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:51,096
I see your aim hasn't improved.

244
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,559
You haven't changed.

245
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,478
You don't scare me, Selene.

246
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:00,397
Well, we're gonna
have to work on that.

247
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:11,909
We need to talk.

248
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,666
Your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than I remember.

249
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,460
How does a Vampire
have Lycan bodyguards?

250
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,087
A gift.

251
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:24,880
From a most persuasive client.

252
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,424
Lucian.

253
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:30,719
Why would Lucian
wanna protect you?

254
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:33,931
Because he was trading with them.

255
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,102
UV rounds.

256
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:40,938
How long have you been
in the business of killing your own?

257
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:44,233
I've done whas necessary
to survive.

258
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:48,737
My decision was made easy the day
your precious Viktor betrayed me.

259
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:51,740
Betrayal was something
he did very well.

260
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:55,828
Viktor's dead. I killed him.

261
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:57,413
You?

262
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,373
Kill Viktor?

263
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,421
No, I think not.

264
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,550
Oh, unless you've learned the truth.

265
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:17,474
So your eyes are finally open.

266
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,519
Isn't it interesting how the truth...

267
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:23,063
...is even harder to absorb
than light?

268
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,441
You know, I tried to stop him,
of course.

269
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:28,569
A travesty,
committing such a horrible crime.

270
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:31,822
And then turning you.

271
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,116
That was too much to take.

272
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,660
My protests are why he put me here.

273
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,747
Careful with that, dear.

274
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:41,123
Makes a terrible bang.

275
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,001
Open the blades and they're active.

276
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,670
Good to know.

277
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,260
Viktor put you here for a reason,
but I doubt it was...

278
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:55,763
...because you had moral qualms.

279
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,975
- What do you know?
- Very little of anything, I'm afraid.

280
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:09,568
Well, then, perhaps I'm mistaken
and there's no use for you at all.

281
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,946
Marcus was after this. Why?

282
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:00,494
Some history is based on truth...

283
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:02,788
...and others on deception.

284
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:08,210
Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

285
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,337
He was once human...

286
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:12,715
...the ruler of these lands.

287
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:16,010
Marcus...

288
00:52:16,636 --> 00:52:18,554
...he's the one.

289
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:21,640
The source.

290
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:24,893
The first true Vampire.

291
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,771
So the legend is true.

292
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:31,734
Toward the end of his ruthless life...

293
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:36,905
...when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold...

294
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,950
...Marcus came with an offer...

295
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:43,912
...a reprieve from sickness
and death.

296
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:46,415
Immortality.

297
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:50,169
And in return, Viktor was to use
his army-turned-immortal to help him.

298
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,838
To do what?

299
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:55,257
To defeat
the very first Werewolves...

300
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,469
...a dangerous
and infectious breed...

301
00:52:58,636 --> 00:53:01,263
...created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

302
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,892
His twin brother, William.

303
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:08,562
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

304
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,148
Disgusting though
your brethren may be...

305
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:13,317
...they at least are evolved.

306
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,778
No, these were raging monsters.

307
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:19,281
Never able to take
human form again.

308
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:22,618
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

309
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:26,538
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

310
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,249
He had to be stopped.

311
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:31,877
And so once Viktor's army
was turned...

312
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:34,463
...the legions of Vampires
under his control...

313
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:37,883
...tracked down
and destroyed the animals...

314
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,385
...then captured William...

315
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:41,470
...and locked him away.

316
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,139
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

317
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,060
Why let him live?

318
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:52,523
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: Fear.

319
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:54,983
He was warned that,
should Marcus be killed...

320
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:58,487
...all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

321
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:01,490
So in Viktor's mind...

322
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,410
...William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans...

323
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:05,703
...his slaves.

324
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:09,206
Yes.

325
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,543
Yes, a clever deception...

326
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,504
...but one Viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test.

327
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,841
And so Marcus was protected...

328
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:21,260
...at all costs.

329
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:25,764
Yes, here we are.

330
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:34,023
- Vampires?
- Mortals.

331
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,193
Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus.

332
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,363
The father of us all.

333
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:50,706
Whas this?

334
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:56,170
You should know.

335
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,173
Is William's prison.

336
00:55:01,384 --> 00:55:05,137
The prison your father
was commissioned to build.

337
00:55:10,685 --> 00:55:13,812
So you've been the one keeping
a watch over this for me, have you?

338
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,273
I've been searching everywhere
for this, my darling.

339
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:22,488
What is it?

340
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,406
Whas wrong?

341
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:28,452
She now understands
why her family was killed.

342
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:33,791
But that was many years later.

343
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,960
The winter of Lucian's escape.

344
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:39,171
Your father knew too much.

345
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,131
Or too much for Viktor to risk...

346
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:43,425
...especially when Lucian...

347
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:47,721
...had the key to William's cell.

348
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:50,599
And I'm the map.

349
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:52,976
Yes.

350
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:58,524
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

351
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:02,277
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young
to remember explicitly...

352
00:56:02,445 --> 00:56:05,698
...but Marcus knows
that the memory...

353
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:09,535
...and therefore the exact location
of William's prison...

354
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:11,870
...is hidden away in your blood.

355
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:15,582
Why is Marcus looking
for him now...

356
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,334
...after all this time?

357
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:18,919
That I cannot answer.

358
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,765
But I do know someone...

359
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,810
...who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

360
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:40,774
In exchange for your discretion,
of course.

361
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:43,527
Of course.

362
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:41,502
Tanis. You seem anxious.

363
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:44,505
Why do you flee
the very sight of me?

364
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:51,136
Please...

365
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,722
...sit.

366
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:57,851
There's no need
for this to be unpleasant.

367
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,522
I've always rather enjoyed
your company.

368
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:09,613
Now you're being rude.

369
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:12,408
Sorry.

370
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:22,710
Viktor struck two keys.

371
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:24,670
What do you know of them?

372
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:28,340
Keys?

373
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:32,219
I don't know of any keys.

374
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:49,695
Oh, yes.

375
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,405
Yes, those keys.

376
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:54,742
- Yes?
- Well, one was...

377
00:58:56,244 --> 00:58:59,038
One was kept in plain sight...

378
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:01,457
...draped around
his daughter's neck...

379
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,668
...right there for you to see.
- And the other?

380
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:10,341
- Kept with Viktor at all times.
- Where?

381
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,135
Within him.

382
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:16,138
Beneath the flesh.

383
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,480
Please. Please.

384
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:25,814
I beg you. Please.

385
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:27,900
Please, I beg you.

386
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:47,044
- Who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

387
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,713
Go to pier 17.
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

388
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:16,365
How do we know Tanis
isn't setting us up?

389
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,992
He's not brave enough
to set me up.

390
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:46,145
You can go.

391
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,282
You're familiar with this, then?

392
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:07,499
Intimately.

393
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,675
You're Alexander Corvinus.

394
01:01:21,931 --> 01:01:26,310
There was a time
that I was known by that name.

395
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:31,065
By any name,
I am still your forefather.

396
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:40,491
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

397
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:43,077
For centuries I've stood by
and watched the havoc...

398
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:48,248
...my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity.

399
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,293
Not the legacy I prayed for...

400
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,754
...the morning I watched them
enter this world.

401
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:57,216
And a tiresome duty...

402
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,594
...keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess...

403
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:04,932
...hiding my family's
unfortunate history.

404
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,434
- Couldn't you have stopped it?
- Yes.

405
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:10,813
Could you kill your own sons?

406
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,315
You know what Marcus will do.

407
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:16,568
If he finds me,
he finds William's prison.

408
01:02:16,736 --> 01:02:18,904
You need to help us stop him.

409
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:24,076
You are asking me
to help you kill my son?

410
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:25,661
You?

411
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,329
A Death Dealer?

412
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:29,498
How many innocents did you kill...

413
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:32,459
...in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

414
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:35,004
Spare me
your self-righteous declarations.

415
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:40,259
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

416
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:43,178
At least he cannot control
his savagery.

417
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:46,473
Anything I've done
can be laid at your feet.

418
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:49,768
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept...

419
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:52,980
...that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

420
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,315
You coulïve stopped all of this.

421
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:57,234
Do not come groveling to me...

422
01:02:57,402 --> 01:03:01,113
...simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

423
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:04,158
You know the devastation William
caused before he was captured.

424
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:05,701
He cannot be set free.

425
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:57,086
Wa- No, wait.
You're no match for him.

426
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,193
Soon, brother.

427
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,521
No.

428
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:10,909
Father.

429
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:12,411
No.

430
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,373
They've gone.
There, there, my child.

431
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,042
You are safe now.

432
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:09,218
No. Michael.

433
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,220
Look at me.

434
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:15,057
Michael.

435
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:16,809
Shit.

436
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:48,132
Please.

437
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,894
Come on.

438
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,442
Fuck.

439
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:53,989
Hello, Father.

440
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:57,618
You are unwelcome in my presence.

441
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:04,375
The predictable heart
that never thaws.

442
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:08,295
Pity it beats within such a fool.

443
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:11,048
The eldest of the immortals...

444
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:15,469
...yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

445
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:21,016
We are oddities of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

446
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,769
This is a world for humanity.

447
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:28,107
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

448
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:30,776
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium...

449
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,530
...as William suffered alone
in darkness?

450
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:37,032
No, Father.

451
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:41,036
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

452
01:08:42,872 --> 01:08:45,749
Viktor's key. Where is it?

453
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:48,711
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

454
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:52,047
- You cannot control your brother.
- Oh, I am stronger now.

455
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:55,634
And our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge.

456
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,136
You're wrong.

457
01:08:57,303 --> 01:09:00,556
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

458
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:02,391
Oh, not Lycans, Father...

459
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:04,685
...or Vampires.

460
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:09,398
A new race, created in
the image of their maker...

461
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:12,109
...their new god:

462
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:17,072
Me.

463
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,462
And a true god...

464
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,801
...has no father.

465
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:15,798
You will fail.

466
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,377
- Get the kit.
- No.

467
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,013
Please, sir, let us help you.

468
01:11:04,472 --> 01:11:06,515
The time has come, my friend.

469
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,643
Find the girl.

470
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:13,147
Bring her to me.

471
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:19,945
No, wait. Wait.

472
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:26,744
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

473
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:34,543
Don't leave him here.

474
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:58,901
- Did he get the pendant?
- Yes.

475
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:02,321
He's too powerful for you alone.

476
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:04,948
You are the only one
older than he is...

477
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,117
...the only one stronger.

478
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:09,703
You could have killed him yourself.

479
01:12:10,872 --> 01:12:13,916
No matter what he's become...

480
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:16,710
...he is my son.

481
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:25,803
You are the last hope left.

482
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:30,057
There is only one way
to defeat him.

483
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:39,441
Quickly, now...

484
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:43,612
...before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

485
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:54,289
What will I become?

486
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:57,751
The future.

487
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,379
Go now.

488
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:31,400
We're getting close.

489
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:28,874
Head back around
towards the river.

490
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:43,013
I don't see a way inside.

491
01:18:45,266 --> 01:18:47,518
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

492
01:18:47,686 --> 01:18:49,770
It must be submerged now.

493
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,438
Looks like we're getting wet.

494
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:29,351
Closer.

495
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:36,525
Selene.

496
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:51,058
William.

497
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,075
Wait.

498
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,581
No, William. Stop.

499
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,709
Be still, brother.

500
01:21:16,876 --> 01:21:18,377
Is me.

501
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:24,717
I'd no sooner harm you than myself.

502
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,417
Which way?

503
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:28,197
Is this it?

504
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:34,370
He's already here.

505
01:23:08,154 --> 01:23:09,905
What is that?

506
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:13,325
Nothing. Les go.

507
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,547
We're too late.

508
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:55,743
- After him.
- Get behind him.

509
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:06,795
Impressive.

510
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:17,199
Michael, you're unique.

511
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:22,371
There's never been
a hybrid before.

512
01:25:23,456 --> 01:25:25,249
Your powers could be limitless.

513
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:44,935
Hold it! Oh, fuck.

514
01:25:48,648 --> 01:25:51,442
- Where is he?
- He went right through there.

515
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,904
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

516
01:25:56,072 --> 01:25:58,574
No, but they'll slow him down.

517
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,497
Les go.

518
01:26:46,998 --> 01:26:48,248
You all right?

519
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:06,869
Jesus Christ!

520
01:29:58,815 --> 01:30:00,399
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

521
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,942
No, these were raging monsters.

522
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,278
Unable to take human form
ever again.

523
01:30:54,704 --> 01:30:56,622
What are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

524
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:59,541
I can't. Not without taking her out.

525
01:30:59,709 --> 01:31:00,918
I can't get a shot.

526
01:31:52,637 --> 01:31:53,929
Michael.

527
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:32,301
Take her down.

528
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:05,542
Cut us loose!

529
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:11,006
We're going down!

530
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:52,066
William!

531
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:06,622
I knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

532
01:35:07,123 --> 01:35:10,501
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

533
01:37:58,837 --> 01:38:01,964
An unknown chapter lies ahead.

534
01:38:02,132 --> 01:38:05,426
The lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred.

535
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:08,554
Chaos and infighting are inevitable.

536
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:12,307
All that is certain is that darkness
is still ahead.

537
01:38:12,475 --> 01:38:16,270
But for now, for the first time...

538
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:16,438
...I look into the light with new hope.
