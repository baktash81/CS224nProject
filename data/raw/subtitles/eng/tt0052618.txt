1
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,527
<i>In the year of our Lord...</i>

2
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:11,439
<i>... Judea, for nearly a century,
had lain under the mastery of Rome.</i>

3
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:14,209
<i>In the seventh year of the reign
of Augustus Caesar...</i>

4
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:16,764
<i>... an imperial decree
ordered every Judean...</i>

5
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,324
<i>... each to return
to his place of birth...</i>

6
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,759
<i>... to be counted and taxed.</i>

7
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:26,442
<i>Converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city, Jerusalem...</i>

8
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,561
<i>... the troubled heart of their land.</i>

9
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,165
<i>The old city was dominated
by the fortress of Antonia...</i>

10
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,688
<i>... the seat of Roman power...</i>

11
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,925
<i>... and by the great golden temple...</i>

12
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,208
<i>... the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith.</i>

13
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,963
<i>Even while they obeyed
the will of Caesar...</i>

14
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,206
<i>... the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage...</i>

15
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,287
<i>... always remembering
the promise of their prophets...</i>

16
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:54,646
<i>... that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer...</i>

17
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,285
<i>... to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom.</i>

18
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,597
You'll be counted at Hebron.

19
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:10,685
- Name?
- Samuel.

20
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,004
- What city?
- Joppa.

21
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,562
- What family?
- Michael.

22
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,521
- Move on. Move on.
- Yes.

23
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,243
- Name?
- Joseph.

24
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,928
- What city?
- Nazareth.

25
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,447
- What family?
- David of Bethlehem.

26
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,804
And the woman?

27
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,165
My wife.

28
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,724
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

29
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,288
Come on, come on.

30
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,242
What village is this?

31
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,604
Nazareth.

32
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,724
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

33
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,878
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

34
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,205
We've seen Romans before.

35
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:05,478
Yes...

36
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,524
...and we will see them again.

37
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,364
My table is not finished.

38
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:16,048
Where is your son?

39
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,484
He's walking in the hills.

40
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:23,198
He neglects his work, Joseph.

41
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:24,684
No.

42
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:29,238
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

43
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,009
"I must be about my father's business."

44
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:34,638
Then why isn't he here, working?

45
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,162
He's working.

46
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:25,360
Trumpeters of the legion!

47
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,201
Welcome, Messala.

48
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,008
The command is yours.

49
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:50,557
Thank you.

50
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,442
Thank you for relieving me.

51
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:03,924
Drusus...

52
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:10,008
...when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

53
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:14,720
Now the wheel has turned.

54
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,246
I am in command.

55
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,528
Attention!

56
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,607
Aisle one, face right!

57
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:34,884
Forward!

58
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,201
I'd forgotten the heat.

59
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,407
If it were only the heat.

60
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:50,366
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.

61
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,958
- My father was head of...
- Yes, I know.

62
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,566
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

63
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,201
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

64
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,166
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

65
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,199
I asked to be sent here.

66
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:12,246
You'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

67
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,042
In what way?

68
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,282
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome...

69
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,765
There's nothing new in all that.

70
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:25,678
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

71
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:29,643
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

72
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:31,957
Punish them.

73
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:35,648
We do.

74
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,321
When we can find them.

75
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,118
Find the leaders.

76
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,526
You don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

77
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:47,004
There are strange forces
at work here.

78
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,642
This "messiah" business...

79
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,409
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

80
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:56,285
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

81
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:57,922
Makes your head spin.

82
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,888
There's a wild man
in the desert named John...

83
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:03,006
...who drowns people in water.

84
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,997
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

85
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:09,558
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

86
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,885
No, no, no. This man is different.

87
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:15,599
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

88
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:20,527
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

89
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,279
You've been too long away from Rome.

90
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:25,888
Go back, Sextus.

91
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,438
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

92
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,686
...and forget that
God is in every man.

93
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,718
- There is divinity in only one man.
- Yes, I know.

94
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,325
The emperor is displeased.

95
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:42,360
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

96
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:45,641
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.

97
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:50,206
How? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

98
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:53,481
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?

99
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,441
Especially a new idea.

100
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:02,804
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

101
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,123
I assume he has a name.

102
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,322
- He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
- Then treat him like one!

103
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,767
Tell him I will join him.

104
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,122
Yes, tribune.

105
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:18,197
Centurion!

106
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,167
This was his country
before it was ours.

107
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:28,718
Don't forget that.

108
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:31,517
Yes, tribune.

109
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:37,083
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

110
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,527
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

111
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,606
We were friends as boys.

112
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:47,807
We were like brothers.

113
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:51,278
Sextus...

114
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,127
...you ask how to fight an idea.

115
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,241
Well, I'll tell you how.

116
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,325
With another idea.

117
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,281
I said I'd come back.

118
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,521
I never thought you would.

119
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,848
I'm so glad.

120
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,887
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

121
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,205
You've come back a tribune.

122
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,283
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

123
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,762
We'll drink another now.

124
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:08,766
- Your sister and mother?
- They're fine.

125
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,767
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

126
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:13,288
- Is Tirzah married?
- No.

127
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,128
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

128
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:18,684
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

129
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,959
I can't wait to see them.

130
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,564
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

131
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,442
Or have you become too dignified?

132
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,808
- Down Eros, up Mars!
- Down Eros, up Mars!

133
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:57,202
Where the beams cross?

134
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:11,644
Good.

135
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,486
After all these years!

136
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,328
Still close.

137
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,127
In every way.

138
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:40,322
I hope so.

139
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,198
I know.

140
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,158
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...

141
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:50,968
...whose life you once saved.

142
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,606
The best thing I ever did.

143
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:00,284
Judah...

144
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,803
...it will be very difficult
to govern here.

145
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,567
I'm going to need help.

146
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:09,519
Your help. Your advice.

147
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,724
- You want my advice?
- Yes, I do.

148
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,201
Withdraw your legions.

149
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,008
Give us our freedom.

150
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,488
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

151
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,884
He's particularly fond of Judea.

152
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:35,808
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

153
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,479
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

154
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,318
My quarters.

155
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:48,644
A bit grim.

156
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:50,248
Not grim.

157
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,883
Austere. Virtuous.

158
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,558
Roman.

159
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:03,041
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

160
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:05,479
He's coming in a few days
with more legions.

161
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:09,521
Then the rumors are true.

162
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,524
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

163
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:19,485
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

164
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,764
But you and your family
need have no concern.

165
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,648
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

166
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,727
- I'm a Jew.
- Ah, you are like a Roman!

167
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,285
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

168
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,726
- They're my people. I'm one of them.
- Be wise, Judah.

169
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,842
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

170
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,798
You've changed.

171
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:49,365
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

172
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:53,164
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber...

173
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:55,007
...was chosen to rule the world.

174
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:56,841
Your legions.

175
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:00,724
It wasn't just our legions.

176
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:05,244
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

177
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:06,484
Oh, no.

178
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:11,640
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

179
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,761
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

180
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,285
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

181
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,798
I believe in the future of my people.

182
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:24,526
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

183
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:26,884
How?

184
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,357
You're an aristocrat.

185
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,766
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.

186
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:35,529
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

187
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:38,118
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

188
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,526
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

189
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,004
It is worse than stupid, futile!

190
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,565
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

191
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:55,728
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

192
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,443
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

193
00:26:58,649 --> 00:26:59,968
Then we're agreed!

194
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:04,004
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

195
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:08,562
- We had hoped tomorrow.
- Good.

196
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,367
And now for our toast.

197
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:17,280
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

198
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,807
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

199
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,839
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

200
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,565
It's an insane world.

201
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:34,358
But in it there is one sanity:

202
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:37,358
The loyalty of old friends.

203
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,843
Judah, we must believe in one another.

204
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:44,201
Will you drink to that?

205
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:49,881
With all my heart.

206
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,483
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

207
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:14,358
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

208
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:18,608
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

209
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:22,040
- We were rascals, weren't we?
- No, you were good boys.

210
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,245
I would have that time again.

211
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,804
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

212
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,408
Except for the fountain.

213
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:32,602
- The old well would go dry, remember?
- Promptly, every summer.

214
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:37,362
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

215
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:40,999
- He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
- No?

216
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:45,561
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

217
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:47,999
With great responsibilities.

218
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,278
Come.

219
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,599
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

220
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:57,642
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

221
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:05,484
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

222
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:08,567
- Is it Roman?
- It's Libyan. I was there last year.

223
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:10,248
A tremendous campaign.

224
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,759
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

225
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:17,041
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

226
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,041
Or was, till we destroyed it.

227
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:22,921
Now it's nothing but ashes.

228
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:27,285
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

229
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:31,241
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

230
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:33,324
Thank you for this.

231
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:37,317
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

232
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:53,848
What do you think of it?

233
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,848
Magnificent.

234
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,128
It's Arabic.

235
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,606
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

236
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,402
Let me try him sometime.

237
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,998
Whenever you like. He's yours.

238
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:14,887
Do you mean you'll give me this?

239
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:17,127
Oh, Judah.

240
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,717
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

241
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,321
Judah, tell me, did you...

242
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,408
...think about what I said?

243
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:36,203
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

244
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:39,003
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

245
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:41,001
Most of the men agree with me.

246
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:43,126
Most? Not all?

247
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,123
No, not all.

248
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:46,523
Who does not agree?

249
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:50,522
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

250
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:51,718
Who are they?

251
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:57,682
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

252
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:07,202
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

253
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,479
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

254
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:12,408
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

255
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,042
Patriots?!

256
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:25,362
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

257
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:30,567
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

258
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,562
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

259
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,158
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

260
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,520
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

261
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:42,607
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

262
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,403
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

263
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,281
I swear, this is the time.

264
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,164
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

265
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,725
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

266
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:00,278
- You speak as if he were God.
- He is God. The only God.

267
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:04,368
He is power,
real power on earth, not...

268
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,362
Not that.

269
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,002
Help me, Judah.

270
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:16,002
I would do anything
for you, Messala...

271
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:19,368
...except betray my own people.

272
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:23,967
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

273
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:31,361
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

274
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,838
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

275
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,643
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

276
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:42,409
Future? You are a conquered people.

277
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:47,918
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

278
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:50,205
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

279
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:54,488
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

280
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,964
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

281
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:00,007
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

282
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:03,958
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

283
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:05,528
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

284
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,685
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

285
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,562
- I am a soldier.
- Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

286
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,602
- I warn you...
- No! I warn you.

287
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:15,481
Rome is an affront to God.

288
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:18,920
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

289
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:20,522
But not forever.

290
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:24,324
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom...

291
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:27,168
...such as the world
has never heard before.

292
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,603
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

293
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:42,803
You're either for me or against me.

294
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,239
If that is the choice...

295
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:53,405
...then I am against you.

296
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,322
There they are.

297
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,362
Where's Messala?

298
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,807
- Where's...?
- He's gone.

299
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,717
Gone?

300
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,641
- But why?
- He couldn't stay.

301
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:36,159
- What happened?
- A new tribune must have many duties.

302
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:39,042
Come. Let us have dinner.

303
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:55,522
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world...

304
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,038
...who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

305
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,684
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

306
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:13,161
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

307
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:03,925
- Master, the caravan from Antioch.
- Yes, Amrah, I saw.

308
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:06,527
Simonides.

309
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,723
- Oh, welcome homecoming.
- Master.

310
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:15,397
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

311
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:18,328
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

312
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,326
And for the master, lberian wine.

313
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:23,327
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence.

314
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:27,158
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

315
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,837
- Caravans from Petra.
- Have all arrived.

316
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:31,767
- Good.
- Here is the accounting.

317
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:33,288
And what of Numidia?

318
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:36,959
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

319
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,639
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

320
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,568
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

321
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:45,517
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

322
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:48,238
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

323
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:51,680
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

324
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,479
- She must be a young woman by now.
- Yes, and your property.

325
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:57,600
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

326
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:01,245
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

327
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:04,998
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

328
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:08,798
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

329
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:12,240
If it is the Lord's will,
I shall rejoice.

330
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:48,247
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

331
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:07,684
You're eager to marry, Esther?

332
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,760
It is my father's wish.

333
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,799
Your husband will be fortunate.

334
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:19,848
What is his name?

335
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,685
David, son of Mathias.

336
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,447
Of what house?

337
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,729
- His own, master.
- He is a freeman.

338
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,598
Tell me more about him.

339
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:34,161
I have seen him only once.

340
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,405
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

341
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:39,004
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

342
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:42,964
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

343
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,845
You are generous, master.

344
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:56,725
Do you love this man?

345
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:03,126
I will learn to love him.

346
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,605
You have my permission to marry.

347
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,644
We'll drink to your happiness.

348
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,958
And a safe return to Antioch.

349
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,521
I disturbed you.

350
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:56,204
No.

351
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,407
What were you thinking?

352
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:01,599
I was saying goodbye...

353
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:03,802
...to this city...

354
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:06,321
...and this house.

355
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:14,278
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

356
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:17,963
My father sometimes brought me here...

357
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:19,762
...when I was little.

358
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,726
It was a house
where I was always happy.

359
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,001
Except once.

360
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:33,122
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy...

361
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:35,327
- Messala.
- Yes.

362
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:38,120
You had been out hunting...

363
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,883
...and they brought you home injured.

364
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:46,118
I touched your face
as you lay there...

365
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:54,238
...and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die."

366
00:40:57,649 --> 00:41:02,040
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

367
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,004
Yes, master.

368
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:08,525
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

369
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:14,277
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

370
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:20,837
And now...

371
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:24,041
...I hardly feel free.

372
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:29,918
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon...

373
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:32,160
...if there was among his slaves...

374
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,042
...some girl who filled his eyes...

375
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:38,249
...he could choose her out
from the rest...

376
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:40,848
...and take her to him.

377
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:43,884
Wise days of Solomon.

378
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,927
Different days.

379
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,282
And long ago.

380
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:02,363
If you were not a bride...

381
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,524
...I should kiss you goodbye.

382
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:10,160
If I were not a bride...

383
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:13,163
...there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

384
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:27,681
Your slave ring.

385
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,687
Fair exchange.

386
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:37,401
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

387
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:39,401
You will wear it?

388
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:49,243
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

389
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:57,722
Until then.

390
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:30,240
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

391
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:33,566
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

392
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:35,402
Thank you, tribune.

393
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,760
I see no delegation from the city.

394
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,039
- There will not be one, sir.
- No?

395
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,519
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

396
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,402
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

397
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:49,528
Let us proceed.

398
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,368
There's Messala.

399
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:03,841
He saw you, Judah.

400
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,688
The new governor.

401
00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:50,323
Stand back!

402
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:54,638
- Stand back.
- You, come!

403
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:56,681
Had to be the Jews!

404
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:05,482
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

405
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,158
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

406
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,166
Open up in the name of the law!

407
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,361
- I was watching the...
- A tile fell and struck the governor.

408
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:26,639
- It wasn't my fault.
- They won't believe her.

409
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:30,319
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

410
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:32,521
Open the gates!

411
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:39,928
I'll speak to them.

412
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,924
- Arrest him!
- Let me tell you what happened.

413
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:45,319
- Hold those women.
- Stop them!

414
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:47,528
It was an accident.

415
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:52,965
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

416
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:56,565
- This is the man, sir. We saw him.
- It was an accident.

417
00:47:57,769 --> 00:47:59,043
- Accident?
- I swear it.

418
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:02,400
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

419
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:04,361
Take him. Take all of them.

420
00:48:04,569 --> 00:48:08,323
- He's telling the truth!
- It was me! Let them go!

421
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:10,288
Attention!

422
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:16,803
Messala.

423
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,517
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

424
00:48:27,729 --> 00:48:30,687
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

425
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:36,324
It was an accident.

426
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:48,326
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

427
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:55,168
Let the servants go.

428
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:57,929
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

429
00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:24,758
Come.

430
00:50:25,049 --> 00:50:26,118
Where?

431
00:50:27,009 --> 00:50:27,964
Tirus.

432
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,128
Tirus?

433
00:50:33,049 --> 00:50:34,767
I've had no trial.

434
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:38,162
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

435
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,963
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

436
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:44,326
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

437
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:45,962
Tie his hands.

438
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:51,879
- At least tell me if they're safe.
- I can tell you nothing.

439
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,928
Get along. Keep moving.

440
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:38,723
Jailer!

441
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:42,245
Guard, in there!

442
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:44,526
Up the stairs!

443
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:45,958
Jailer!

444
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:48,838
Jailer!

445
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:52,163
To the right.

446
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:46,425
- Wait!
- Send them out.

447
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:56,624
Go!

448
00:53:01,355 --> 00:53:02,390
The door.

449
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:12,871
Where are my mother and sister?

450
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:25,224
Where are they?

451
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:30,431
Here, within these walls.

452
00:53:31,595 --> 00:53:34,029
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

453
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:38,146
Of course, they will be sentenced.

454
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,387
Is it possible?

455
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:49,268
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

456
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:51,511
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

457
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:57,672
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!

458
00:54:01,835 --> 00:54:04,827
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!

459
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:06,627
I know you're not.

460
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:09,753
You know?

461
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:14,784
You are evil.

462
00:54:15,235 --> 00:54:17,624
No, Judah, I am not evil.

463
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:19,987
I wanted your help.

464
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,546
Now you've given it to me.

465
00:54:23,355 --> 00:54:26,472
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

466
00:54:26,755 --> 00:54:30,543
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

467
00:54:33,155 --> 00:54:35,146
But not my family.

468
00:54:36,515 --> 00:54:38,153
Let them go.

469
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:39,710
Please.

470
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:44,430
- Messala, I beg you.
- Beg?!

471
00:54:47,435 --> 00:54:49,471
Didn't I beg you?

472
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,314
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

473
00:54:58,155 --> 00:55:00,305
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die...

474
00:55:00,515 --> 00:55:02,745
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

475
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:06,347
Go on, Judah.

476
00:55:07,395 --> 00:55:08,589
Kill me!

477
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:23,190
May God grant me vengeance.

478
00:55:23,395 --> 00:55:27,070
I will pray that
you live till I return.

479
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,030
Return?

480
00:55:34,355 --> 00:55:35,424
Take him.

481
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:10,871
Sentries, salute.

482
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:15,673
The tribune will see you now.

483
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,305
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

484
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:51,988
I remember you.

485
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:55,910
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

486
00:56:56,155 --> 00:56:59,750
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

487
00:56:59,955 --> 00:57:01,468
Better than you.

488
00:57:01,715 --> 00:57:05,993
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

489
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:08,351
The prisoners have been sentenced.

490
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:10,706
- Sentenced?
- But there's no truth in it.

491
00:57:10,915 --> 00:57:14,271
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

492
00:57:14,475 --> 00:57:17,148
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

493
00:57:17,355 --> 00:57:19,550
In your heart, you must know it.

494
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:25,790
Drusus.

495
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:33,752
This man had better be kept here
until we can question him.

496
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:28,270
Hold!

497
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:23,747
Water for the soldiers.

498
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:25,793
Soldiers first!

499
00:59:28,395 --> 00:59:31,068
Get away from that well.
No water for them!

500
00:59:31,555 --> 00:59:34,023
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

501
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,994
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

502
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:43,588
- Water. Water.
- Soldiers first!

503
00:59:52,075 --> 00:59:53,144
Here.

504
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:16,224
Wait.

505
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:18,787
No water for him.

506
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,274
God...

507
01:00:41,995 --> 01:00:43,872
...help me.

508
01:01:35,555 --> 01:01:38,308
You! I said no water for him!

509
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,271
All right, on your feet, all of you!

510
01:02:13,515 --> 01:02:14,834
Get them on their feet!

511
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:17,951
Back in line, you dog!

512
01:02:30,475 --> 01:02:31,828
On your feet!

513
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:33,594
Get them going!

514
01:02:36,555 --> 01:02:39,865
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

515
01:02:42,795 --> 01:02:44,706
Forward, you dogs!

516
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:49,664
Soon, the counselor's barge
will be coming alongside.

517
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,672
Be ready to raise oars.

518
01:03:57,635 --> 01:04:00,388
Raise oars!

519
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,825
Down oars!

520
01:04:22,515 --> 01:04:24,187
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

521
01:04:43,795 --> 01:04:46,514
- How many rowers?
- Two hundred, consul.

522
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:49,434
- And reliefs?
- Of 30, every hour.

523
01:05:22,915 --> 01:05:25,952
This man is ill. Replace him.

524
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:28,231
- Change him.
- Right, sir.

525
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:37,424
- This man's been giving you trouble?
- He's insubordinate, consul.

526
01:05:37,715 --> 01:05:39,592
That will stop.

527
01:06:02,755 --> 01:06:04,711
What service have you seen?

528
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:07,948
Forty-one.

529
01:06:08,755 --> 01:06:11,986
A month's less a day in this ship.

530
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,230
You keep an exact account.
And before?

531
01:06:16,435 --> 01:06:19,791
Three years in other ships.

532
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:23,032
Three years.

533
01:06:43,435 --> 01:06:45,790
You have the spirit to fight back...

534
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:48,545
...but the good sense to control it.

535
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:55,464
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.

536
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:59,868
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

537
01:07:00,195 --> 01:07:01,947
It gives him strength.

538
01:07:03,915 --> 01:07:05,553
Now, listen to me, all of you.

539
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:10,232
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

540
01:07:14,795 --> 01:07:16,672
So row well...

541
01:07:17,515 --> 01:07:19,073
...and live.

542
01:07:27,275 --> 01:07:29,869
- Ship ready, consul.
- Strike oars.

543
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:33,591
Strike oars!

544
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,385
You know a fleet
of Macedonian galleys...

545
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:58,268
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

546
01:07:58,835 --> 01:08:01,668
The emperor has honored us
with the task...

547
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,389
...of seeking out and destroying them.

548
01:08:34,915 --> 01:08:36,712
Battle speed, hortator.

549
01:08:38,835 --> 01:08:41,065
Battle speed!

550
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:11,544
Attack speed.

551
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:13,753
Attack speed!

552
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:53,624
Ramming speed.

553
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,354
Ramming speed!

554
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:08,464
Rest.

555
01:11:09,235 --> 01:11:10,748
Halt!

556
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:13,069
Rest!

557
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:14,790
Why are you here?

558
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:18,305
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

559
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:21,993
Oh, yes.

560
01:12:22,475 --> 01:12:24,033
I'd forgotten.

561
01:12:30,075 --> 01:12:32,145
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

562
01:12:32,355 --> 01:12:34,425
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

563
01:12:35,035 --> 01:12:36,946
I'm not ready to die.

564
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:39,192
What do you think will save you?

565
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,910
The God of my fathers.

566
01:12:43,435 --> 01:12:45,312
Your God has forsaken you.

567
01:12:45,515 --> 01:12:48,587
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

568
01:12:48,795 --> 01:12:52,470
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

569
01:12:52,675 --> 01:12:54,074
I might.

570
01:12:54,515 --> 01:12:57,348
Does that interest you, 41?

571
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:01,306
I can see that it does.

572
01:13:02,555 --> 01:13:05,592
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments...

573
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:08,468
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

574
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:11,667
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

575
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,991
Would you like to become one of them?

576
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:16,272
To die as your slave?

577
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:18,905
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

578
01:13:19,515 --> 01:13:21,471
I will not be here forever.

579
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:23,790
No?

580
01:13:28,035 --> 01:13:30,469
What would you do if you escaped?

581
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:35,504
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister...

582
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:37,865
...though they were innocent.
I won't rest...

583
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:39,827
Do not say that you were innocent.

584
01:13:40,035 --> 01:13:43,186
- Would it do any good to say it again?
- No.

585
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:48,312
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

586
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:52,554
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

587
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,594
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these years...

588
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:57,467
...to die chained to an oar.

589
01:13:57,675 --> 01:14:01,145
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep...

590
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:04,108
...to believe that
existence has a purpose.

591
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:08,354
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

592
01:14:08,555 --> 01:14:09,988
As you have.

593
01:14:10,795 --> 01:14:12,706
What drove it out of you?

594
01:14:14,155 --> 01:14:16,669
Go back to your oar, 41.

595
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,511
Consul, enemy sighted.

596
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,910
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

597
01:14:44,515 --> 01:14:47,188
All the watch to battle posts.

598
01:14:51,915 --> 01:14:53,985
- Stand by to load.
- Make ready to fire.

599
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:55,548
Hurry, quick!

600
01:14:57,955 --> 01:15:00,628
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

601
01:15:05,995 --> 01:15:08,031
Raise oars!

602
01:15:09,195 --> 01:15:11,470
Down oars!

603
01:15:11,795 --> 01:15:12,750
Chain rowers!

604
01:15:34,755 --> 01:15:35,983
Guard.

605
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:39,988
Unlock 41.

606
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:42,551
No! I don't want to die!

607
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,473
I don't want to die!

608
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:16,752
41, why did he do that?

609
01:16:17,515 --> 01:16:18,868
I don't know.

610
01:16:21,515 --> 01:16:24,393
Once before, a man helped me.

611
01:16:25,275 --> 01:16:27,266
I didn't know why then.

612
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:31,786
Normal speed!

613
01:17:06,475 --> 01:17:08,591
Number 1, flame.

614
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:10,630
Fire.

615
01:17:22,835 --> 01:17:23,824
Fire!

616
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:25,470
Fire!

617
01:17:30,955 --> 01:17:32,832
Hold withdrawal on command.

618
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,948
Lift oars! Raise!

619
01:17:37,355 --> 01:17:39,073
Withdraw!

620
01:17:41,555 --> 01:17:42,590
Steersman, right.

621
01:17:50,075 --> 01:17:51,713
Extend oars!

622
01:17:53,355 --> 01:17:54,504
Fire!

623
01:18:15,155 --> 01:18:16,634
- Watch out!
- Fire!

624
01:18:32,595 --> 01:18:35,473
Steersman, ram course! Order below!

625
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,825
- Ramming speed!
- Ramming speed!

626
01:18:48,795 --> 01:18:51,229
Consul, barge on ramming course.

627
01:18:58,515 --> 01:19:01,985
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

628
01:23:44,995 --> 01:23:46,348
Why did you save me?

629
01:23:49,035 --> 01:23:51,469
Why did you have me unchained?

630
01:24:11,315 --> 01:24:13,749
What is your name, 41?

631
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:17,428
Judah Ben-Hur.

632
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:20,226
Judah Ben-Hur...

633
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:23,069
...let me die.

634
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:29,346
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

635
01:24:29,755 --> 01:24:31,234
Row well and live.

636
01:24:46,555 --> 01:24:47,783
Is the sail square?

637
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:51,546
I can't tell.

638
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:55,389
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

639
01:24:56,755 --> 01:24:57,790
My death.

640
01:24:58,355 --> 01:24:59,993
Your freedom.

641
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,511
It's a Roman sail.

642
01:25:35,075 --> 01:25:36,474
Face rear!

643
01:25:36,675 --> 01:25:40,554
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

644
01:25:43,795 --> 01:25:44,910
Water.

645
01:25:49,195 --> 01:25:51,072
The fleet, all lost?

646
01:25:51,315 --> 01:25:52,873
Five galleys.

647
01:25:53,475 --> 01:25:56,672
- And the battle?
- The battle was won.

648
01:25:57,035 --> 01:25:58,354
You have a victory.

649
01:25:59,315 --> 01:26:01,829
- It was a victory?
- Complete.

650
01:26:19,755 --> 01:26:21,905
In His eagerness to save you...

651
01:26:22,155 --> 01:26:25,625
...your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

652
01:26:58,715 --> 01:27:01,229
Hail Arrius!

653
01:27:03,675 --> 01:27:05,711
Right oars!

654
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:56,392
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

655
01:29:57,235 --> 01:30:00,545
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

656
01:30:08,075 --> 01:30:10,953
This man riding beside you, who is he?

657
01:30:11,355 --> 01:30:14,313
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

658
01:30:14,515 --> 01:30:16,471
Is that all you know about him?

659
01:30:18,835 --> 01:30:23,431
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

660
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:25,432
But he was innocent.

661
01:30:25,635 --> 01:30:28,308
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man...

662
01:30:28,515 --> 01:30:32,747
...who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

663
01:30:33,675 --> 01:30:36,508
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

664
01:31:04,995 --> 01:31:07,793
We have all the information
on this man...

665
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:10,350
...a man of some influence
in his own country.

666
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:14,708
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

667
01:31:14,915 --> 01:31:17,668
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

668
01:31:18,075 --> 01:31:21,351
Consul, allow us to continue.

669
01:31:22,475 --> 01:31:24,784
Allow us to be generous.

670
01:31:25,955 --> 01:31:29,072
As a reward to you
for your great victory...

671
01:31:29,395 --> 01:31:32,944
...we shall not send him back to
the galleys. Take him as your slave.

672
01:31:37,315 --> 01:31:39,510
Such is the will of the senate...

673
01:31:40,315 --> 01:31:42,192
...and the people of Rome.

674
01:32:59,515 --> 01:33:01,665
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

675
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:04,548
...with a young man
who had saved my life.

676
01:33:04,755 --> 01:33:07,827
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

677
01:33:08,035 --> 01:33:11,391
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

678
01:33:17,475 --> 01:33:21,946
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

679
01:33:22,955 --> 01:33:25,515
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements...

680
01:33:25,955 --> 01:33:28,025
...which I thought
I should never have again.

681
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,311
Nothing could make stronger
our bond...

682
01:33:35,515 --> 01:33:37,949
...but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

683
01:33:39,075 --> 01:33:42,863
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

684
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:46,112
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name...

685
01:33:46,315 --> 01:33:48,431
...and the heir to my property.

686
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:55,184
This ring of my ancestors...

687
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,711
...would have gone to my son.

688
01:33:59,035 --> 01:34:01,595
So now it is yours.

689
01:34:21,755 --> 01:34:26,306
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life...

690
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:28,588
...a new home...

691
01:34:29,515 --> 01:34:30,948
...a new father.

692
01:34:32,395 --> 01:34:34,431
It brought me here.

693
01:34:35,075 --> 01:34:36,986
It may take me away.

694
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,473
But wherever I may be...

695
01:34:39,715 --> 01:34:43,708
...I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

696
01:34:44,235 --> 01:34:47,227
With gratitude and affection...

697
01:34:48,435 --> 01:34:49,709
...and with honor.

698
01:35:08,515 --> 01:35:10,949
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

699
01:35:11,195 --> 01:35:14,232
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

700
01:35:14,435 --> 01:35:16,346
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

701
01:35:16,555 --> 01:35:18,750
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

702
01:35:18,955 --> 01:35:21,310
- Tell me, you come from Judea?
- Yes, sir.

703
01:35:21,515 --> 01:35:24,188
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

704
01:35:24,395 --> 01:35:26,226
Not for Judeans.

705
01:35:29,715 --> 01:35:32,912
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

706
01:35:33,155 --> 01:35:34,827
- Of Judea?
- Yes.

707
01:35:35,035 --> 01:35:36,434
I asked for Alexandria.

708
01:35:36,635 --> 01:35:39,388
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

709
01:35:39,595 --> 01:35:42,553
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

710
01:35:42,755 --> 01:35:46,065
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

711
01:35:46,315 --> 01:35:48,624
Goats and Jehovah.

712
01:36:06,395 --> 01:36:07,714
You're leaving.

713
01:36:10,755 --> 01:36:12,188
I must.

714
01:36:13,515 --> 01:36:15,870
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

715
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:21,633
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

716
01:36:21,835 --> 01:36:25,430
But still, my counsel is to wait.

717
01:36:25,635 --> 01:36:27,990
Gratus is to be replaced.

718
01:36:28,235 --> 01:36:31,272
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

719
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,024
When?

720
01:36:36,515 --> 01:36:37,914
Very soon.

721
01:36:38,475 --> 01:36:40,670
It's very much to our purpose.

722
01:36:41,795 --> 01:36:46,186
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

723
01:36:49,235 --> 01:36:53,308
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

724
01:36:59,995 --> 01:37:02,190
Will Rome see you again?

725
01:37:09,035 --> 01:37:12,425
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

726
01:37:13,955 --> 01:37:15,707
I shall remember it.

727
01:37:18,795 --> 01:37:23,027
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

728
01:37:23,915 --> 01:37:25,268
They have their way.

729
01:39:01,915 --> 01:39:03,348
Forgive me.

730
01:39:03,715 --> 01:39:05,831
You're a stranger here.

731
01:39:07,035 --> 01:39:09,344
Would you be from Nazareth?

732
01:39:11,515 --> 01:39:12,868
Why do you ask?

733
01:39:13,355 --> 01:39:14,310
I thought...

734
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:18,070
...you might be the one...

735
01:39:19,995 --> 01:39:23,431
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

736
01:39:27,235 --> 01:39:29,590
He would be about your age.

737
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:31,511
Who?

738
01:39:35,075 --> 01:39:36,827
When I find Him...

739
01:39:38,155 --> 01:39:39,634
...I shall know Him.

740
01:39:44,755 --> 01:39:47,986
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

741
01:39:48,235 --> 01:39:50,590
I am the guest of Sheik llderim.

742
01:39:51,435 --> 01:39:53,153
Sack of flesh without brains!

743
01:39:53,355 --> 01:39:55,994
No! No! Not the whip!

744
01:39:57,515 --> 01:39:58,550
That is my host.

745
01:39:58,755 --> 01:39:59,870
Gently! Gently!

746
01:40:00,475 --> 01:40:03,831
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

747
01:40:04,035 --> 01:40:07,266
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood.

748
01:40:07,475 --> 01:40:11,434
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

749
01:40:16,435 --> 01:40:19,791
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

750
01:40:20,595 --> 01:40:21,789
Beautiful horses.

751
01:40:32,995 --> 01:40:35,350
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

752
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:44,190
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

753
01:40:46,275 --> 01:40:48,743
No! No!

754
01:40:50,515 --> 01:40:52,585
Abadon, stop him!

755
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:55,834
Stop that whip!

756
01:40:56,035 --> 01:40:57,946
I'll kill him! I'll kill...!

757
01:41:03,235 --> 01:41:06,272
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

758
01:41:09,235 --> 01:41:11,874
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?!

759
01:41:13,315 --> 01:41:16,034
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

760
01:41:16,275 --> 01:41:17,788
Get off, idiot!

761
01:41:22,915 --> 01:41:24,428
Drive goats, not horses!

762
01:41:24,635 --> 01:41:26,705
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

763
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:30,032
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

764
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:34,708
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

765
01:41:34,915 --> 01:41:36,268
Not a team?

766
01:41:36,475 --> 01:41:39,194
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

767
01:41:39,395 --> 01:41:41,590
- Antares.
- The slow one?

768
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:45,947
He should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

769
01:41:51,475 --> 01:41:54,751
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

770
01:41:54,955 --> 01:41:56,752
In the circus in Rome.

771
01:41:58,715 --> 01:42:01,183
You have driven in the great circus?

772
01:42:02,835 --> 01:42:06,987
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

773
01:42:07,235 --> 01:42:08,714
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

774
01:42:08,915 --> 01:42:10,906
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

775
01:42:11,155 --> 01:42:13,146
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

776
01:42:13,355 --> 01:42:15,425
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

777
01:42:15,635 --> 01:42:18,866
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

778
01:42:20,675 --> 01:42:24,463
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

779
01:42:24,675 --> 01:42:27,235
No other animal has
descended so in scale...

780
01:42:27,435 --> 01:42:29,903
...from the first innocent falling
of the world.

781
01:42:30,915 --> 01:42:34,510
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

782
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:38,025
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

783
01:42:38,515 --> 01:42:40,426
Judah Ben-Hur.

784
01:42:40,635 --> 01:42:43,354
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

785
01:42:43,555 --> 01:42:44,670
Yes.

786
01:42:46,195 --> 01:42:50,029
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

787
01:42:50,835 --> 01:42:53,349
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

788
01:42:53,555 --> 01:42:56,023
We might have achieved wonders!

789
01:42:56,235 --> 01:42:57,987
You have to go.

790
01:43:02,235 --> 01:43:04,191
I make a journey which will not wait.

791
01:43:04,395 --> 01:43:06,625
Ah, well, then perhaps
you will come back.

792
01:43:06,835 --> 01:43:09,144
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

793
01:43:09,355 --> 01:43:10,993
I have no wives.

794
01:43:11,235 --> 01:43:13,066
No wives at all?

795
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:15,590
I have six, no, seven.

796
01:43:15,795 --> 01:43:17,387
I've counted eight.

797
01:43:17,675 --> 01:43:20,747
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

798
01:43:20,955 --> 01:43:24,186
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

799
01:43:24,395 --> 01:43:26,955
- Someday, I hope to have one.
- One wife!

800
01:43:27,195 --> 01:43:31,393
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

801
01:43:31,715 --> 01:43:33,592
It is not generous.

802
01:43:38,635 --> 01:43:42,230
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Indeed.

803
01:43:53,715 --> 01:43:55,546
Thank you. Thank you.

804
01:43:55,755 --> 01:44:00,226
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

805
01:44:01,395 --> 01:44:04,831
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

806
01:44:05,475 --> 01:44:08,148
When ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

807
01:44:08,355 --> 01:44:11,074
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

808
01:44:11,595 --> 01:44:13,825
- I'll make my farewells then.
- No, no, no, stay.

809
01:44:14,035 --> 01:44:15,912
Stay and see them.

810
01:44:29,235 --> 01:44:32,033
Come, my children. Come.

811
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,467
Strangers make them shy.

812
01:44:40,755 --> 01:44:41,631
Come.

813
01:44:42,075 --> 01:44:44,794
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

814
01:44:50,355 --> 01:44:52,311
There, my children.

815
01:44:52,635 --> 01:44:55,354
They are descended from
the Arabians of the Pharaohs...

816
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:57,785
...and I have named them
for the stars.

817
01:44:59,435 --> 01:45:00,948
Come, Antares.

818
01:45:01,195 --> 01:45:04,585
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

819
01:45:04,795 --> 01:45:07,229
What? Yes, yes.

820
01:45:07,435 --> 01:45:11,064
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

821
01:45:11,315 --> 01:45:12,464
Come, Rigel.

822
01:45:12,675 --> 01:45:16,224
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

823
01:45:16,595 --> 01:45:17,744
There's my good Rigel.

824
01:45:19,915 --> 01:45:22,145
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

825
01:45:23,395 --> 01:45:25,784
The day's work done for you, eh?

826
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:29,310
Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

827
01:45:29,555 --> 01:45:31,864
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

828
01:45:33,915 --> 01:45:36,987
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

829
01:45:37,235 --> 01:45:40,750
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

830
01:45:43,195 --> 01:45:45,470
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

831
01:45:45,675 --> 01:45:47,586
You should see their mother, Mira.

832
01:45:47,795 --> 01:45:50,707
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

833
01:45:50,915 --> 01:45:52,792
All right, all right.

834
01:45:56,995 --> 01:46:00,624
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

835
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:04,791
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

836
01:46:05,555 --> 01:46:09,628
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

837
01:46:10,355 --> 01:46:12,744
You must be strong and swift.

838
01:46:12,955 --> 01:46:15,310
Go, my children. Go.

839
01:46:19,515 --> 01:46:22,473
At Jerusalem, they'll race
the world's finest teams...

840
01:46:22,675 --> 01:46:26,270
...and the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

841
01:46:26,475 --> 01:46:28,067
He stops at nothing to win.

842
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:31,034
- Messala? In the circus?
- Yes.

843
01:46:31,235 --> 01:46:32,827
You knew him?

844
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:35,024
I know him.

845
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:37,511
Perhaps without much liking.

846
01:46:40,915 --> 01:46:42,633
My people are praying for a man...

847
01:46:42,835 --> 01:46:45,269
...to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

848
01:46:45,475 --> 01:46:47,511
You could be that man, the one...

849
01:46:47,715 --> 01:46:49,751
...to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

850
01:46:49,955 --> 01:46:52,947
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them...

851
01:46:53,195 --> 01:46:56,665
...one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

852
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,547
It's not possible.

853
01:46:59,795 --> 01:47:01,353
That is a pity.

854
01:47:02,315 --> 01:47:04,271
Think of it. To break his pride...

855
01:47:04,475 --> 01:47:07,831
...to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

856
01:47:08,035 --> 01:47:12,392
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

857
01:47:12,995 --> 01:47:15,065
I know it is not possible.

858
01:47:15,435 --> 01:47:18,074
Does it not delight your imagination?

859
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:21,705
Does it not answer your purpose?

860
01:47:22,715 --> 01:47:24,831
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

861
01:47:25,475 --> 01:47:27,545
And your way is to kill him.

862
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:33,948
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes.

863
01:47:34,315 --> 01:47:38,354
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to kill him.

864
01:47:38,755 --> 01:47:41,030
He will be punished inevitably.

865
01:47:42,075 --> 01:47:43,633
I don't believe in miracles.

866
01:47:44,635 --> 01:47:46,466
But all life is a miracle.

867
01:47:46,675 --> 01:47:48,905
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

868
01:47:51,675 --> 01:47:53,506
You do not believe in miracles.

869
01:47:54,355 --> 01:47:57,267
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness...

870
01:47:57,475 --> 01:48:00,035
...and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem...

871
01:48:00,235 --> 01:48:03,193
...where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

872
01:48:03,395 --> 01:48:05,192
And God lived in this child.

873
01:48:06,275 --> 01:48:09,984
By now, He is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

874
01:48:10,235 --> 01:48:11,827
That is why I have returned here...

875
01:48:12,035 --> 01:48:14,708
...so that I may be at hand
when He comes among us.

876
01:48:16,835 --> 01:48:18,348
He is near.

877
01:48:19,315 --> 01:48:22,785
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

878
01:48:23,315 --> 01:48:27,069
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

879
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:29,785
Perhaps He is a shepherd...

880
01:48:29,995 --> 01:48:32,748
...a merchant, a fisherman.

881
01:48:33,235 --> 01:48:34,873
But He lives...

882
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:39,227
...and all our lives from now on
will carry His mark.

883
01:48:41,315 --> 01:48:43,954
There are many paths to God, my son.

884
01:48:45,035 --> 01:48:47,185
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

885
01:48:57,595 --> 01:48:59,347
I'm ready for sleep.

886
01:49:13,195 --> 01:49:15,504
Balthasar is a good man...

887
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:19,788
...but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

888
01:49:20,075 --> 01:49:22,066
And our intention true.

889
01:49:23,195 --> 01:49:24,867
So I must leave you.

890
01:49:26,995 --> 01:49:28,792
One last thought.

891
01:49:28,995 --> 01:49:31,589
There is no law in the arena.

892
01:49:32,435 --> 01:49:34,187
Many are killed.

893
01:49:36,835 --> 01:49:38,109
I hope to see you again.

894
01:49:53,435 --> 01:49:55,710
Fine Damascus silk.

895
01:49:55,995 --> 01:49:58,225
Fine Damascus silk.

896
01:52:00,155 --> 01:52:01,474
Esther?

897
01:52:12,555 --> 01:52:14,227
It's Judah.

898
01:52:22,155 --> 01:52:23,986
You are alive.

899
01:52:24,995 --> 01:52:27,145
You are alive.

900
01:52:28,835 --> 01:52:32,623
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

901
01:52:41,675 --> 01:52:42,949
I'm here.

902
01:52:44,835 --> 01:52:45,950
I'm with you.

903
01:52:52,195 --> 01:52:53,787
Where's your father?

904
01:52:58,595 --> 01:53:02,270
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

905
01:53:02,715 --> 01:53:04,433
They tortured him.

906
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:09,232
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

907
01:53:10,635 --> 01:53:15,186
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

908
01:53:15,795 --> 01:53:17,911
You never went back to Antioch?

909
01:53:18,275 --> 01:53:19,390
No.

910
01:53:19,635 --> 01:53:23,867
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

911
01:53:30,155 --> 01:53:32,032
Where are my mother and sister?

912
01:53:41,275 --> 01:53:43,231
Let me tell him first.

913
01:54:00,995 --> 01:54:02,144
Father.

914
01:54:03,355 --> 01:54:05,949
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

915
01:54:07,235 --> 01:54:09,226
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.

916
01:54:10,595 --> 01:54:13,792
He has come home. He is here.

917
01:54:30,755 --> 01:54:32,029
Judah.

918
01:54:33,795 --> 01:54:36,025
Judah Ben-Hur.

919
01:54:38,595 --> 01:54:40,665
My dear old friend.

920
01:54:42,595 --> 01:54:44,472
Let me look at you.

921
01:54:44,995 --> 01:54:46,474
Let me see you.

922
01:54:47,835 --> 01:54:50,668
Yes, yes. It is true.

923
01:54:51,395 --> 01:54:54,831
Praise God for His mercy.

924
01:55:15,515 --> 01:55:16,834
Where are they?

925
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:21,067
Since that terrible day...

926
01:55:21,955 --> 01:55:24,389
...there has been no word of them.

927
01:55:39,595 --> 01:55:41,506
You should have been less loyal.

928
01:55:41,715 --> 01:55:43,626
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

929
01:55:43,835 --> 01:55:46,747
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

930
01:55:48,235 --> 01:55:52,194
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

931
01:55:52,395 --> 01:55:54,386
We were released on the same day.

932
01:55:54,595 --> 01:55:59,225
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

933
01:55:59,435 --> 01:56:01,744
Since then, I have been his tongue...

934
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,547
...and he has been my legs.

935
01:56:03,755 --> 01:56:06,827
Together, we make a considerable man.

936
01:56:08,675 --> 01:56:10,233
Old friend.

937
01:56:11,635 --> 01:56:14,308
She always said you would return.

938
01:56:14,515 --> 01:56:16,745
She never gave up hope.

939
01:56:18,755 --> 01:56:21,223
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

940
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:26,150
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

941
01:56:27,435 --> 01:56:29,630
But suppose that isn't possible.

942
01:56:29,835 --> 01:56:32,303
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

943
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:35,231
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

944
01:56:35,435 --> 01:56:38,233
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

945
01:56:38,435 --> 01:56:39,504
It is there still...

946
01:56:39,715 --> 01:56:42,991
...to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

947
01:56:46,155 --> 01:56:48,385
That's not why I came back.

948
01:56:48,635 --> 01:56:51,433
Judah, they are dead.

949
01:56:51,835 --> 01:56:56,306
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

950
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:03,673
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

951
01:57:04,355 --> 01:57:06,471
Yes, it is true.

952
01:57:08,715 --> 01:57:11,434
Judah Ben-Hur.

953
01:57:13,915 --> 01:57:17,590
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

954
01:57:17,795 --> 01:57:20,787
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

955
01:57:20,995 --> 01:57:22,269
- Let us laugh.
- We will.

956
01:57:22,475 --> 01:57:24,272
There will be joy again
in this house.

957
01:57:24,475 --> 01:57:27,308
We will celebrate among the dust.

958
01:57:39,755 --> 01:57:41,154
I will take him.

959
01:58:11,435 --> 01:58:13,312
We stood here before.

960
01:58:16,435 --> 01:58:18,391
A long while ago.

961
01:58:19,475 --> 01:58:20,828
Four years.

962
01:58:24,555 --> 01:58:26,273
But now it seems as if...

963
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:28,706
...only yesterday...

964
01:58:30,555 --> 01:58:31,988
I was saying:

965
01:58:34,155 --> 01:58:37,750
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye."

966
01:58:39,715 --> 01:58:41,751
"If I were not a bride...

967
01:58:41,955 --> 01:58:44,628
...there would be
no goodbyes to be said."

968
01:58:54,915 --> 01:58:56,667
I am not a bride.

969
01:59:27,315 --> 01:59:29,465
Why did you never marry?

970
01:59:31,555 --> 01:59:33,273
My father needed me.

971
01:59:37,835 --> 01:59:39,154
And also...

972
01:59:47,715 --> 01:59:49,626
It's still on my finger.

973
01:59:51,875 --> 01:59:56,426
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

974
02:00:03,075 --> 02:00:05,635
It's become a part of my hand.

975
02:00:14,075 --> 02:00:16,987
If Messala once knew you were here...

976
02:00:17,435 --> 02:00:18,788
As he must.

977
02:00:19,355 --> 02:00:21,232
He will know where they are.

978
02:00:28,955 --> 02:00:30,627
And if you should find...?

979
02:00:33,275 --> 02:00:36,824
- If he says they're dead...
- Messala will wish they were living.

980
02:00:42,155 --> 02:00:45,272
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

981
02:00:45,835 --> 02:00:47,951
My father is burned up with it.

982
02:00:49,955 --> 02:00:54,392
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater...

983
02:00:54,595 --> 02:00:57,314
...and love more powerful than hatred.

984
02:00:58,395 --> 02:00:59,828
I believe it.

985
02:01:00,435 --> 02:01:02,266
- Esther.
- Judah.

986
02:01:02,795 --> 02:01:04,387
Stay alive.

987
02:01:04,955 --> 02:01:06,832
Keep away from Messala.

988
02:01:07,075 --> 02:01:09,794
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

989
02:01:11,835 --> 02:01:13,746
That time isn't yet come.

990
02:01:13,955 --> 02:01:18,267
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

991
02:01:18,755 --> 02:01:21,349
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

992
02:01:21,555 --> 02:01:23,671
This time you will be destroyed.

993
02:01:23,875 --> 02:01:25,354
You'll die.

994
02:02:07,395 --> 02:02:10,785
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

995
02:02:10,995 --> 02:02:13,555
- Consul here?
- Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

996
02:02:13,755 --> 02:02:15,746
Thank him. Bring him to me.

997
02:02:16,555 --> 02:02:21,629
- I didn't know the consul had a son.
- He's a champion of the great circus.

998
02:02:21,955 --> 02:02:23,308
Why is he presenting me with gifts?

999
02:02:25,395 --> 02:02:27,670
- Perhaps he'll race against you.
- Look.

1000
02:02:29,515 --> 02:02:31,153
It's magnificent.

1001
02:02:31,355 --> 02:02:33,186
And from a man I've never met.

1002
02:02:33,395 --> 02:02:35,351
You're wrong, Messala.

1003
02:02:58,915 --> 02:03:01,793
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

1004
02:03:03,075 --> 02:03:05,270
You were the magician, Messala.

1005
02:03:05,475 --> 02:03:07,670
You condemned me to the galleys.

1006
02:03:08,395 --> 02:03:11,068
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

1007
02:03:22,795 --> 02:03:24,353
You know his seal?

1008
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:37,706
Now I have come back...

1009
02:03:37,995 --> 02:03:40,270
...as I swore I would.

1010
02:03:45,555 --> 02:03:49,594
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

1011
02:03:50,595 --> 02:03:53,189
You suggest I use it on myself?

1012
02:03:54,635 --> 02:03:58,344
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

1013
02:04:01,955 --> 02:04:04,867
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

1014
02:04:05,515 --> 02:04:06,789
Find them, Messala.

1015
02:04:08,235 --> 02:04:10,669
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed...

1016
02:04:10,875 --> 02:04:14,265
...with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

1017
02:04:17,715 --> 02:04:20,673
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.

1018
02:04:20,875 --> 02:04:21,830
Then get it.

1019
02:04:26,595 --> 02:04:28,711
I will come back tomorrow.

1020
02:04:29,595 --> 02:04:32,268
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1021
02:04:46,555 --> 02:04:48,147
What became of them?

1022
02:04:48,435 --> 02:04:51,825
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

1023
02:04:52,035 --> 02:04:54,549
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1024
02:04:54,755 --> 02:04:56,871
- And if they're dead?
- They're dead!

1025
02:05:11,235 --> 02:05:14,193
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter."

1026
02:05:14,395 --> 02:05:16,829
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

1027
02:05:17,275 --> 02:05:18,594
E section...

1028
02:05:19,835 --> 02:05:21,268
...Iower level.

1029
02:05:22,355 --> 02:05:25,472
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

1030
02:05:42,435 --> 02:05:43,550
Water.

1031
02:05:44,075 --> 02:05:45,144
Water.

1032
02:05:45,755 --> 02:05:46,983
Let me out!

1033
02:06:21,155 --> 02:06:23,908
- How long since you've seen them?
- Never.

1034
02:06:24,155 --> 02:06:28,034
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

1035
02:06:31,155 --> 02:06:32,793
The food disappears.

1036
02:07:05,835 --> 02:07:07,154
Lepers.

1037
02:07:35,235 --> 02:07:37,988
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

1038
02:07:38,235 --> 02:07:39,793
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1039
02:08:24,675 --> 02:08:26,154
Is someone there?

1040
02:08:31,555 --> 02:08:33,591
There is someone there.

1041
02:08:46,395 --> 02:08:47,589
Who are you?

1042
02:08:50,595 --> 02:08:52,313
Don't come any closer.

1043
02:08:55,475 --> 02:08:56,430
Who are you?

1044
02:08:59,715 --> 02:09:00,670
Esther.

1045
02:09:02,595 --> 02:09:03,869
It's Miriam.

1046
02:09:04,395 --> 02:09:05,464
Miriam.

1047
02:09:07,715 --> 02:09:08,943
Miriam?

1048
02:09:11,515 --> 02:09:13,585
Stay where you are.

1049
02:09:15,715 --> 02:09:17,512
You have come home.

1050
02:09:19,195 --> 02:09:21,186
Stand back, Esther.

1051
02:09:29,515 --> 02:09:30,914
We are lepers.

1052
02:09:43,955 --> 02:09:45,513
Oh, Esther.

1053
02:09:47,355 --> 02:09:48,583
Tirzah.

1054
02:09:56,995 --> 02:09:58,394
Esther...

1055
02:10:00,075 --> 02:10:02,305
...is Judah living?

1056
02:10:03,075 --> 02:10:05,794
Yes, he is alive.

1057
02:10:06,555 --> 02:10:08,193
He is here.

1058
02:10:10,915 --> 02:10:11,870
Where?

1059
02:10:13,755 --> 02:10:17,031
He is searching for you now.

1060
02:10:17,355 --> 02:10:20,153
I must find him and tell him.

1061
02:10:20,355 --> 02:10:21,504
- No!
- Tell my father.

1062
02:10:21,715 --> 02:10:22,830
No.

1063
02:10:23,755 --> 02:10:25,393
Tell no one.

1064
02:10:27,995 --> 02:10:31,305
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

1065
02:10:31,715 --> 02:10:33,194
We won't return.

1066
02:10:36,275 --> 02:10:38,311
Judah has to be told.

1067
02:10:38,755 --> 02:10:39,710
No.

1068
02:10:42,635 --> 02:10:43,704
Please.

1069
02:11:02,235 --> 02:11:04,590
I couldn't see his face.

1070
02:11:06,315 --> 02:11:07,873
Is it changed?

1071
02:11:10,675 --> 02:11:13,633
No, he is not changed.

1072
02:11:19,075 --> 02:11:20,793
He's not changed.

1073
02:11:23,035 --> 02:11:25,026
You love him, Esther.

1074
02:11:35,715 --> 02:11:37,353
Promise me...

1075
02:11:37,955 --> 02:11:39,946
...on your love for him...

1076
02:11:41,155 --> 02:11:43,715
...you will never tell him
you've seen us.

1077
02:11:52,435 --> 02:11:54,312
Is he never to know?

1078
02:11:58,155 --> 02:12:00,623
Let him remember us as we were.

1079
02:12:02,155 --> 02:12:03,304
Promise me.

1080
02:12:13,555 --> 02:12:16,706
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1081
02:12:17,715 --> 02:12:19,307
Only this.

1082
02:12:26,155 --> 02:12:27,793
I promise.

1083
02:12:31,715 --> 02:12:33,387
I am content.

1084
02:12:51,995 --> 02:12:53,144
Wait.

1085
02:13:37,355 --> 02:13:39,391
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

1086
02:13:39,595 --> 02:13:43,508
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

1087
02:13:43,715 --> 02:13:45,512
He'll free them.

1088
02:13:45,715 --> 02:13:47,751
He wants to survive.

1089
02:13:49,195 --> 02:13:50,913
He cannot free them, Judah.

1090
02:13:54,635 --> 02:13:55,590
What do you mean?

1091
02:14:04,355 --> 02:14:05,344
I saw them.

1092
02:14:05,755 --> 02:14:07,347
You saw them?

1093
02:14:07,555 --> 02:14:08,670
Where?

1094
02:14:08,875 --> 02:14:10,467
When did you see them?

1095
02:14:15,875 --> 02:14:17,274
They were dead.

1096
02:14:19,755 --> 02:14:21,347
They were dead.

1097
02:14:23,395 --> 02:14:24,350
When?

1098
02:14:25,955 --> 02:14:28,230
When? When?!

1099
02:14:30,475 --> 02:14:31,828
In the prison.

1100
02:14:33,955 --> 02:14:36,708
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

1101
02:14:41,155 --> 02:14:42,873
Why didn't you tell me?

1102
02:14:48,355 --> 02:14:49,708
I couldn't tell you.

1103
02:14:50,915 --> 02:14:52,587
Nor even you, Father.

1104
02:14:54,195 --> 02:14:56,504
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala...

1105
02:14:57,275 --> 02:15:00,392
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

1106
02:15:00,595 --> 02:15:01,914
It's over now.

1107
02:15:02,395 --> 02:15:03,544
Over?

1108
02:15:04,435 --> 02:15:05,948
- Judah.
- Over?

1109
02:15:06,195 --> 02:15:10,268
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.

1110
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:41,399
Gentlemen.

1111
02:20:41,610 --> 02:20:42,406
Officers.

1112
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:47,089
Defenders of great Rome's imperium...

1113
02:20:47,890 --> 02:20:49,482
...may I enter?

1114
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:51,563
Certainly, sheik.

1115
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:53,881
You do us an unexpected honor.

1116
02:20:54,970 --> 02:20:57,245
The noble tribune is most gracious.

1117
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:07,360
And now...

1118
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:09,322
...the question you're asking:

1119
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:11,122
Why am I here?

1120
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:13,447
As you know, I am a gambling man.

1121
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:14,878
The games approach.

1122
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:19,959
I am racing my whites against the
noble tribune's undefeated blacks.

1123
02:21:20,170 --> 02:21:22,240
I will back my own poor horses.

1124
02:21:22,450 --> 02:21:23,883
No limits?

1125
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:41,769
- Mark me first!
- And me!

1126
02:21:41,970 --> 02:21:43,403
- What odds?
- A moment, please...

1127
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:46,522
...my lords, protectors
of the far flung marshes.

1128
02:21:46,770 --> 02:21:48,123
May I first sit down?

1129
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:50,082
Sit. How much will you wager?

1130
02:21:50,290 --> 02:21:53,009
- Yes, let's call his game.
- Give the Arab a seat.

1131
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:55,041
A bench, quickly.

1132
02:21:56,050 --> 02:21:57,324
Thank you.

1133
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:02,606
<i>- Now.
- 1000 denarii.</i>

1134
02:22:02,810 --> 02:22:05,199
- 2000!
- Mark me!

1135
02:22:05,410 --> 02:22:10,006
Your spirit does you credit, but do
not be impatient. There is time.

1136
02:22:10,410 --> 02:22:13,368
First gentlemen, the odds.

1137
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:17,206
The tribune has won many times. The
odds should be in the same measure.

1138
02:22:18,250 --> 02:22:20,366
What is your pleasure, gentlemen?

1139
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:22,678
Two to one.

1140
02:22:24,490 --> 02:22:28,403
Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,
masters of the Earth...

1141
02:22:28,610 --> 02:22:32,080
...where is the courage
that made Rome master of the world?

1142
02:22:32,290 --> 02:22:34,884
I can get better odds
on any street market.

1143
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:37,043
Three to one.

1144
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:39,680
Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.

1145
02:22:39,930 --> 02:22:43,127
In four years, the tribune has won
four victories in the circus.

1146
02:22:43,330 --> 02:22:45,480
- In all truth...
- Just a moment.

1147
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:49,522
We know you have good horses,
but who is your driver?

1148
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:55,366
Did I not tell you?
How careless of me.

1149
02:22:55,570 --> 02:22:57,481
The Prince of Hur.

1150
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:01,564
Judah Ben-Hur.

1151
02:23:01,810 --> 02:23:03,368
Prince of Hur?

1152
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:07,168
- He was sent to the galleys years ago.
- He has returned.

1153
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:09,486
Returned? Lmpossible.

1154
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:13,046
The divine Tiberius is merciful
as always.

1155
02:23:15,650 --> 02:23:16,605
Well?

1156
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:21,008
Will no one back the noble tribune
against a Jew, a galley slave?

1157
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:26,600
Perhaps I made a mistake
in coming here.

1158
02:23:30,370 --> 02:23:31,803
You, tribune...

1159
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:34,001
...will you give me four to one?

1160
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:39,404
Four to one.

1161
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:40,605
Good.

1162
02:23:41,290 --> 02:23:45,920
Four to one, sheik. The difference
between a Roman and a Jew.

1163
02:23:46,130 --> 02:23:47,643
Or an Arab.

1164
02:23:53,250 --> 02:23:54,842
Bravely spoken.

1165
02:23:56,850 --> 02:24:01,048
Now we will settle the amount
of our wager. I will venture...

1166
02:24:11,490 --> 02:24:13,321
A thousand talents?

1167
02:24:14,890 --> 02:24:18,803
- A thousand talents?
- Yes, a thousand talents.

1168
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:26,201
Of course, if it is too much...

1169
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:29,641
A thousand talents it will be.

1170
02:24:30,050 --> 02:24:31,199
Agreed.

1171
02:25:16,490 --> 02:25:18,958
Treat them well.
They've earned it today.

1172
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:31,643
You're good fellows.

1173
02:25:31,970 --> 02:25:33,881
If only men were this good.

1174
02:25:36,170 --> 02:25:37,364
Remember, Altair...

1175
02:25:37,570 --> 02:25:40,130
...nine times around the circus.

1176
02:25:42,410 --> 02:25:43,604
Aldebaran.

1177
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:49,446
Rigel, did you hear?

1178
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:51,481
Nine lives to live.

1179
02:25:53,210 --> 02:25:55,121
My swift fellow.

1180
02:25:55,890 --> 02:25:59,200
You must not win the race
the first time around.

1181
02:25:59,850 --> 02:26:02,125
You win the last time around.

1182
02:26:03,410 --> 02:26:07,403
And you cannot win alone.
You must wait for the others.

1183
02:26:10,410 --> 02:26:12,640
Steady Antares.

1184
02:26:12,890 --> 02:26:14,323
Like a rock.

1185
02:26:15,770 --> 02:26:17,522
You will be our anchor.

1186
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:27,364
I thought they'd never love
another as they love me.

1187
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:29,845
They have taken me into their family.

1188
02:26:30,810 --> 02:26:32,607
Rest well, my stars.

1189
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:34,806
Tomorrow we go up to the city.

1190
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:39,609
Then if you defeat Messala and
the new governor there to see it...

1191
02:26:39,850 --> 02:26:42,603
...the news will scorch the streets
of the Roman world.

1192
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:43,839
Pontius Pilate here?

1193
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:45,961
Yes, and ready to grind
his heel into us.

1194
02:26:46,170 --> 02:26:49,367
You will make him see
what men are born in this land.

1195
02:26:49,970 --> 02:26:53,201
I only know that
I race against Messala.

1196
02:27:08,810 --> 02:27:10,209
Look for the yoke.

1197
02:27:12,410 --> 02:27:13,889
Ease that strap.

1198
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:57,801
God forgive me for seeking vengeance,
but my path is set.

1199
02:27:58,010 --> 02:28:02,288
Into Your hands I commit my life.
Do with me as You will.

1200
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:18,808
The Star of David.

1201
02:28:19,010 --> 02:28:22,002
To shine out for your people
and my people together...

1202
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:24,246
...and blind the eyes of Rome.

1203
02:28:26,570 --> 02:28:27,366
They are ready.

1204
02:28:55,250 --> 02:28:57,161
Easy, girl, easy.

1205
02:29:35,170 --> 02:29:36,808
Number five.

1206
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:39,880
Where is number five?

1207
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:13,164
This is the day, Judah.
It's between us now.

1208
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:16,687
Yes, this is the day.

1209
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:22,682
Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.

1210
02:30:38,450 --> 02:30:41,886
Judah, be careful.
Don't let him near you.

1211
02:30:53,050 --> 02:30:56,326
Hail, Jupiter. Give me victory.

1212
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:30,164
Watch your line! Keep your places!

1213
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:56,010
The formation is good.
A beautiful line.

1214
02:35:16,690 --> 02:35:17,918
Citizens...

1215
02:35:18,810 --> 02:35:23,326
...I welcome you to these games
in the name of your emperor, Tiberius.

1216
02:35:23,930 --> 02:35:26,444
We dedicate them to his glory...

1217
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:29,084
...and to the glory of Rome...

1218
02:35:29,290 --> 02:35:31,850
...of which you are all part.

1219
02:35:35,010 --> 02:35:38,082
Let us honor those
who race for us today.

1220
02:35:38,570 --> 02:35:41,004
They come here from Alexandria...

1221
02:35:41,210 --> 02:35:42,359
...Messina...

1222
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:43,884
...Carthage...

1223
02:35:44,090 --> 02:35:45,284
...Cyprus...

1224
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:46,605
...Rome...

1225
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:47,999
...Corinth...

1226
02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:49,564
...Athens...

1227
02:35:49,810 --> 02:35:50,959
...Phrygia...

1228
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:52,842
...and Judea.

1229
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:03,807
To the best of these,
a crown of victory.

1230
02:36:04,530 --> 02:36:06,566
The race begins.

1231
02:36:07,170 --> 02:36:09,320
Hail, Caesar!

1232
02:40:02,850 --> 02:40:04,841
Come, my children, come!

1233
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:22,683
The Roman pig!

1234
02:46:39,050 --> 02:46:40,324
Salute.

1235
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:56,042
A great victory.

1236
02:46:56,250 --> 02:46:58,764
You are the people's one true god...

1237
02:46:58,970 --> 02:47:00,528
...for the time being.

1238
02:47:01,090 --> 02:47:02,762
Permit us to worship.

1239
02:47:10,370 --> 02:47:12,759
I crown their god.

1240
02:47:31,890 --> 02:47:35,519
I will send for you.
I have a message from Rome.

1241
02:47:36,210 --> 02:47:40,249
A long life, young Arrius
and the good sense to live it.

1242
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:06,520
We cannot wait, tribune.

1243
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:08,965
He will come. He will...

1244
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:18,761
We cannot wait any longer, tribune.

1245
02:48:18,970 --> 02:48:20,642
He will come!

1246
02:48:24,050 --> 02:48:25,449
He will come.

1247
02:48:26,170 --> 02:48:29,480
I've sent for him, and he will come.

1248
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:33,889
If you wish us to keep you alive,
we have to go to work now, tribune.

1249
02:48:34,610 --> 02:48:35,884
Do you understand?

1250
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:38,126
To hack the legs off me?

1251
02:48:38,370 --> 02:48:41,919
Not yet. Not till I've seen him.

1252
02:48:42,490 --> 02:48:44,845
I don't receive him with half a body.

1253
02:48:58,130 --> 02:48:59,324
No!

1254
02:49:06,690 --> 02:49:09,602
I told you, Drusus. I told you.

1255
02:49:09,970 --> 02:49:11,528
Here he is.

1256
02:49:45,690 --> 02:49:48,124
Triumph complete, Judah.

1257
02:49:48,850 --> 02:49:51,762
The race won. The enemy destroyed.

1258
02:49:56,690 --> 02:49:58,681
I see no enemy.

1259
02:50:00,250 --> 02:50:02,002
What do you think you see?

1260
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:05,008
The smashed body of a wretched animal?

1261
02:50:07,570 --> 02:50:11,165
There's enough of a man
still left here for you to hate.

1262
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:17,922
Let me help you.

1263
02:50:31,850 --> 02:50:35,001
You think they're dead,
your mother and sister.

1264
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:38,489
Dead. And the race over.

1265
02:50:40,690 --> 02:50:42,920
It isn't over, Judah.

1266
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:44,885
They're not dead.

1267
02:50:50,330 --> 02:50:52,082
Where are they?

1268
02:51:03,130 --> 02:51:04,563
Where are they?

1269
02:51:08,250 --> 02:51:09,763
Where are they?!

1270
02:51:13,410 --> 02:51:15,048
Look for them...

1271
02:51:15,330 --> 02:51:18,879
...in the Valley of the Lepers...

1272
02:51:20,810 --> 02:51:23,404
...if you can recognize them.

1273
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:39,562
It goes on.

1274
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:42,966
It goes on, Judah.

1275
02:51:45,050 --> 02:51:46,403
The race...

1276
02:51:48,690 --> 02:51:52,922
The race is not over.

1277
02:53:39,528 --> 02:53:41,325
Is there a way down here?

1278
02:53:41,648 --> 02:53:44,640
Are you a madman?
Keep well out of this place.

1279
02:54:31,608 --> 02:54:32,757
Man.

1280
02:54:37,528 --> 02:54:41,203
I'm searching for two women,
a mother and daughter.

1281
02:54:44,688 --> 02:54:46,679
There are many women.

1282
02:54:48,248 --> 02:54:50,523
Of the family of Hur.

1283
02:54:52,368 --> 02:54:54,563
We have no names here.

1284
02:55:51,608 --> 02:55:52,563
For them?

1285
02:55:57,688 --> 02:56:00,486
- Why did you say they were dead?
- It was what they wanted.

1286
02:56:00,688 --> 02:56:04,647
You must not betray this faith.
Would you do this for them?

1287
02:56:04,968 --> 02:56:06,606
Not to see them?

1288
02:56:06,888 --> 02:56:07,957
They are coming.

1289
02:56:08,168 --> 02:56:12,684
Love them in the way they must need
to be loved. Not to look at them.

1290
02:56:12,888 --> 02:56:15,482
Let them be as if you had
never come here. Please!

1291
02:57:26,808 --> 02:57:28,082
Is Judah well?

1292
02:57:29,368 --> 02:57:31,324
Is he happy?

1293
02:57:32,488 --> 02:57:35,366
Yes, he is well.

1294
02:57:38,488 --> 02:57:41,048
Your mind can be at rest for him.

1295
02:57:41,648 --> 02:57:43,240
He is well, Miriam.

1296
02:57:52,808 --> 02:57:54,241
God be with you.

1297
02:58:29,168 --> 02:58:30,521
They have gone.

1298
02:58:37,168 --> 02:58:38,647
We can go back.

1299
02:58:42,968 --> 02:58:45,562
Go back to what?

1300
02:58:47,888 --> 02:58:50,277
Judah, they have one blessing left.

1301
02:58:50,648 --> 02:58:53,765
To think you remember them
as they were...

1302
02:58:55,048 --> 02:58:56,959
...and live your own life.

1303
02:58:59,568 --> 02:59:01,240
Forget what is here.

1304
02:59:01,448 --> 02:59:02,597
Forget?

1305
02:59:05,448 --> 02:59:07,120
It's as though
they're alive in a grave.

1306
02:59:07,328 --> 02:59:09,922
- But what can you do?
- Undo what you've done.

1307
02:59:10,128 --> 02:59:13,438
How could you have suffered them
to come here? I must see them.

1308
02:59:13,648 --> 02:59:16,082
No, Judah, please! Judah!

1309
02:59:20,248 --> 02:59:24,446
Think, Judah, think. It would
tear them apart if they see you.

1310
03:00:30,128 --> 03:00:33,882
He is here. I have found Him.
The child has become a man.

1311
03:00:34,128 --> 03:00:38,201
And the man, I know it now,
is the Son of God.

1312
03:00:42,208 --> 03:00:43,926
The promise is true.

1313
03:00:45,128 --> 03:00:48,757
Happy Balthasar.
Life has answered you.

1314
03:00:48,968 --> 03:00:50,959
Life has been answered.

1315
03:00:51,208 --> 03:00:53,005
God has answered it.

1316
03:01:07,448 --> 03:01:09,359
Come. Come with me.

1317
03:01:12,568 --> 03:01:14,923
When the Romans were marching me
to the galleys...

1318
03:01:15,128 --> 03:01:17,119
...thirst had nearly killed me.

1319
03:01:17,328 --> 03:01:19,967
A man gave me water to drink.

1320
03:01:20,208 --> 03:01:21,846
I went on living.

1321
03:01:22,208 --> 03:01:25,439
I should have done better
if I had poured it into the sand.

1322
03:01:25,648 --> 03:01:26,478
No.

1323
03:01:27,408 --> 03:01:28,887
I am thirsty still.

1324
03:01:29,608 --> 03:01:31,360
Come and listen.

1325
03:01:33,288 --> 03:01:35,244
I have business with Rome.

1326
03:01:37,008 --> 03:01:38,964
You insist on death.

1327
03:01:43,968 --> 03:01:45,447
Goodbye, Judah.

1328
03:03:34,088 --> 03:03:34,998
You sent for me?

1329
03:03:35,208 --> 03:03:38,086
I hope I bring you
a good conclusion to your victory.

1330
03:03:38,288 --> 03:03:41,325
I have a message for you
from the consul, your father.

1331
03:03:43,328 --> 03:03:46,286
- I honor him.
- As you may honor yourself.

1332
03:03:46,488 --> 03:03:48,683
You have been made a citizen of Rome.

1333
03:03:52,408 --> 03:03:54,444
Do you say nothing to this?

1334
03:03:57,128 --> 03:04:00,325
I have just come
from the Valley of Stone...

1335
03:04:00,528 --> 03:04:04,237
...where my mother and sister live
what's left of their lives.

1336
03:04:04,448 --> 03:04:09,124
By Rome's will,
lepers, outcasts without hope.

1337
03:04:09,368 --> 03:04:13,520
I have heard this. There was great
blame there, very deeply regretted.

1338
03:04:13,768 --> 03:04:18,239
Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.
It already carries Rome's mark.

1339
03:04:18,448 --> 03:04:20,962
Messala is dead.
What he did has had its way with him.

1340
03:04:21,168 --> 03:04:24,478
The deed was not Messala's.
I knew him, well.

1341
03:04:24,688 --> 03:04:27,441
Before the cruelty of Rome
spread in his blood.

1342
03:04:27,648 --> 03:04:31,880
Rome destroyed Messala as surely
as Rome has destroyed my family.

1343
03:04:32,088 --> 03:04:36,161
Where there is greatness,
great government or power...

1344
03:04:36,368 --> 03:04:38,563
...even great feeling or compassion...

1345
03:04:38,808 --> 03:04:41,163
...error also is great.

1346
03:04:41,368 --> 03:04:43,359
We progress and mature by fault.

1347
03:04:43,568 --> 03:04:47,083
Rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future.

1348
03:04:47,368 --> 03:04:48,767
There are other voices.

1349
03:04:48,968 --> 03:04:52,324
The voice, for instance, of Arrius
waiting for you in Rome.

1350
03:04:52,528 --> 03:04:54,917
He would tell you,
if I may speak in his place...

1351
03:04:55,408 --> 03:04:58,445
...not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment...

1352
03:04:58,648 --> 03:05:00,684
...or impossible loyalties.

1353
03:05:00,888 --> 03:05:03,118
Perfect freedom has no existence.

1354
03:05:03,328 --> 03:05:06,126
A grown man knows the world
he lives in.

1355
03:05:06,328 --> 03:05:09,638
And for the present, the world is Rome.

1356
03:05:10,648 --> 03:05:12,923
Young Arrius, I am sure,
will choose it.

1357
03:05:14,928 --> 03:05:16,759
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

1358
03:05:28,408 --> 03:05:30,876
I cross this floor
in spoken friendship...

1359
03:05:31,088 --> 03:05:33,204
...as I would speak to Arrius.

1360
03:05:33,648 --> 03:05:37,163
But when I go up those stairs,
I become the hand of Caesar...

1361
03:05:37,368 --> 03:05:39,802
...ready to crush those
who challenge his authority.

1362
03:05:40,568 --> 03:05:42,638
There are too many men
of envy and ambition...

1363
03:05:42,888 --> 03:05:44,958
...who try to disrupt
the government of Rome.

1364
03:05:45,168 --> 03:05:47,636
You have become the victor
and hero to those people.

1365
03:05:48,208 --> 03:05:52,167
They look to you,
their one true god, as I call you.

1366
03:05:52,608 --> 03:05:56,396
If you stay here, you will find
yourself part of this tragedy.

1367
03:05:57,328 --> 03:06:00,240
I am already part of this tragedy.

1368
03:06:06,408 --> 03:06:08,399
Return this to Arrius.

1369
03:06:09,888 --> 03:06:12,322
I honor him too well
to wear it any longer.

1370
03:06:21,648 --> 03:06:23,764
Even for Arrius' sake,
I cannot protect you...

1371
03:06:23,968 --> 03:06:26,528
...from personal disaster
if you stay here.

1372
03:06:27,328 --> 03:06:29,284
You are too great a danger.

1373
03:06:44,448 --> 03:06:46,200
Leave Judea.

1374
03:06:47,968 --> 03:06:49,765
You have my word.

1375
03:07:22,608 --> 03:07:24,917
I was afraid
you would never come back...

1376
03:07:25,128 --> 03:07:27,323
...afraid of what would happen to you.

1377
03:07:29,048 --> 03:07:30,959
But I see you again.

1378
03:07:33,328 --> 03:07:35,762
Your father's waiting for me.

1379
03:07:39,928 --> 03:07:41,077
Where is he?

1380
03:07:43,808 --> 03:07:45,036
What do you mean to do?

1381
03:07:55,848 --> 03:07:57,964
Rest, sleep.

1382
03:07:58,168 --> 03:08:01,319
For a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace.

1383
03:08:01,528 --> 03:08:02,802
Peace?

1384
03:08:03,008 --> 03:08:04,885
Love and peace.

1385
03:08:05,088 --> 03:08:07,966
Do you think I don't long for them
as much as you do?

1386
03:08:08,288 --> 03:08:09,357
Where do you see them?

1387
03:08:10,848 --> 03:08:12,804
If you had heard this man
from Nazareth.

1388
03:08:13,008 --> 03:08:14,236
Balthasar's word.

1389
03:08:16,048 --> 03:08:18,516
He is more than Balthasar's word.

1390
03:08:19,048 --> 03:08:22,882
His voiced traveled
with such a still purpose.

1391
03:08:23,248 --> 03:08:25,239
It was more than a voice.

1392
03:08:26,128 --> 03:08:28,244
A man more than a man.

1393
03:08:31,808 --> 03:08:35,642
He said, "Blessed are the merciful...

1394
03:08:35,848 --> 03:08:38,043
...for they shall obtain mercy.

1395
03:08:38,888 --> 03:08:41,083
Blessed are the peacemakers...

1396
03:08:41,288 --> 03:08:44,280
...for they shall be called
the children of God."

1397
03:08:44,848 --> 03:08:46,042
Children of God?

1398
03:08:47,048 --> 03:08:49,767
In that dead valley
where we left them?

1399
03:08:49,968 --> 03:08:53,597
I tell you every man of Judea is
unclean and will stay unclean...

1400
03:08:53,848 --> 03:08:56,885
...until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth...

1401
03:08:57,088 --> 03:08:59,204
...of being at the mercy of tyranny.

1402
03:08:59,648 --> 03:09:03,084
No other life is possible
except to wash this land clean.

1403
03:09:03,288 --> 03:09:04,960
- In blood?
- Yes, in blood!

1404
03:09:07,088 --> 03:09:08,840
I know there is a law in life.

1405
03:09:09,048 --> 03:09:12,836
That blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog.

1406
03:09:13,088 --> 03:09:15,079
Death generates death...

1407
03:09:15,288 --> 03:09:17,802
...as the vulture breeds the vulture.

1408
03:09:18,528 --> 03:09:20,996
But the voice I heard today
on the hill said:

1409
03:09:21,208 --> 03:09:22,846
"Love your enemy.

1410
03:09:23,168 --> 03:09:26,205
Do good to those who
despitefully use you."

1411
03:09:26,888 --> 03:09:30,244
All who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done.

1412
03:09:30,448 --> 03:09:32,643
As you make us do now.

1413
03:09:36,168 --> 03:09:38,443
Are we to bear nothing together?

1414
03:09:40,168 --> 03:09:41,442
Even love?

1415
03:09:45,008 --> 03:09:47,476
I can hardly draw breath...

1416
03:09:47,888 --> 03:09:50,038
...without feeling you in my heart.

1417
03:09:51,288 --> 03:09:52,687
But I know...

1418
03:09:54,328 --> 03:09:56,683
...that everything I do
from this moment...

1419
03:09:56,888 --> 03:09:59,925
...bears greater pain
than you have ever suffered.

1420
03:10:01,248 --> 03:10:03,318
It is better not to love me.

1421
03:10:04,848 --> 03:10:09,205
It was Judah Ben-Hur I loved.
What has become of him?

1422
03:10:09,648 --> 03:10:12,481
You seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy...

1423
03:10:12,688 --> 03:10:16,966
...giving evil for evil.
Hatred is turning you to stone.

1424
03:10:17,168 --> 03:10:18,999
It's as though
you had become Messala.

1425
03:10:27,368 --> 03:10:29,359
I've lost you, Judah.

1426
03:11:29,408 --> 03:11:31,080
No further.

1427
03:11:32,008 --> 03:11:33,282
What are you doing here?

1428
03:11:34,008 --> 03:11:36,442
I was here last evening
waiting for you.

1429
03:11:36,648 --> 03:11:39,003
I have waited all night.
What has happened?

1430
03:11:39,888 --> 03:11:41,287
Where is Tirzah?

1431
03:11:44,368 --> 03:11:46,086
Leave the food.

1432
03:11:47,168 --> 03:11:49,807
I am coming closer. Don't be afraid.

1433
03:11:50,008 --> 03:11:52,283
- What are you doing?
- Don't be afraid.

1434
03:11:52,688 --> 03:11:55,202
I've heard Him again,
the man from Nazareth.

1435
03:11:55,408 --> 03:11:59,606
If ever words were from God,
they are in everything He says.

1436
03:11:59,848 --> 03:12:02,806
I cannot bear that
you should have never known...

1437
03:12:03,008 --> 03:12:06,683
...this hand of quiet
reaching towards us.

1438
03:12:07,088 --> 03:12:10,000
He is going to Jerusalem.
We can find Him there.

1439
03:12:10,208 --> 03:12:12,517
Bring Tirzah
and we can go together to find Him.

1440
03:12:15,328 --> 03:12:17,444
Tirzah is dying.

1441
03:12:23,608 --> 03:12:26,042
Leave the food and go.

1442
03:12:28,168 --> 03:12:29,760
It's Judah.

1443
03:12:33,808 --> 03:12:35,844
Why did you tell him?

1444
03:12:36,608 --> 03:12:38,439
Yes, Judah, yes.

1445
03:12:39,048 --> 03:12:42,120
No nearer, please, God, no nearer.

1446
03:12:42,328 --> 03:12:43,317
Mother.

1447
03:12:46,128 --> 03:12:48,961
Wait, Mother, wait.

1448
03:12:49,168 --> 03:12:50,237
Let me talk with you.

1449
03:12:50,448 --> 03:12:51,801
Please.

1450
03:12:52,008 --> 03:12:54,476
No, no further. Please.

1451
03:12:54,688 --> 03:12:58,237
No, Judah. Son, no.

1452
03:12:58,968 --> 03:13:01,846
Mother, let me see Tirzah.

1453
03:13:02,048 --> 03:13:03,003
Tirzah is dying.

1454
03:13:13,248 --> 03:13:16,320
Judah, if they would see Jesus
of Nazareth they will know...

1455
03:13:16,528 --> 03:13:18,439
...that life is everlasting...

1456
03:13:18,648 --> 03:13:22,163
...and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith.

1457
03:13:24,688 --> 03:13:26,280
I will take them to Him.

1458
03:13:28,288 --> 03:13:29,323
No!

1459
03:13:30,168 --> 03:13:31,647
God, no!

1460
03:13:44,848 --> 03:13:47,646
No, no, dear son.

1461
03:13:48,648 --> 03:13:49,797
Mother...

1462
03:13:52,448 --> 03:13:53,927
...where is Tirzah?

1463
03:13:57,008 --> 03:13:57,963
Judah, no.

1464
03:13:59,528 --> 03:14:01,246
Judah, no.

1465
03:14:09,648 --> 03:14:12,401
You must not go to her, dear son.

1466
03:14:13,688 --> 03:14:14,962
Please.

1467
03:14:15,528 --> 03:14:17,007
Dear son.

1468
03:15:06,168 --> 03:15:07,760
I am afraid.

1469
03:15:08,688 --> 03:15:10,246
No cause.

1470
03:15:11,648 --> 03:15:13,957
The world is more than we know.

1471
03:15:48,688 --> 03:15:51,760
Tirzah, it's Judah.

1472
03:15:54,208 --> 03:15:55,960
No, Judah.

1473
03:16:37,848 --> 03:16:40,362
Alms for the blind?

1474
03:16:41,368 --> 03:16:43,928
Alms for the blind?

1475
03:16:46,928 --> 03:16:49,488
Alms for the blind?

1476
03:16:51,248 --> 03:16:55,366
- Why are the streets deserted?
- They have gone to the trial.

1477
03:16:55,568 --> 03:16:57,877
Trial? Whose trial?

1478
03:16:58,088 --> 03:17:01,239
The young rabbi from Nazareth.
They are wanting his death.

1479
03:17:01,448 --> 03:17:03,484
- This cannot be true.
- Alms?

1480
03:17:04,888 --> 03:17:06,162
What has he done?

1481
03:17:06,368 --> 03:17:09,963
Nothing I know of.
For the blind, for the blind.

1482
03:17:10,168 --> 03:17:11,999
Help for the blind.

1483
03:17:12,208 --> 03:17:14,278
- Look, lepers!
- Lepers!

1484
03:17:15,608 --> 03:17:18,168
Get away! Stay away!

1485
03:17:19,448 --> 03:17:20,676
Go away!

1486
03:19:34,408 --> 03:19:36,444
Lepers! Lepers!

1487
03:19:57,128 --> 03:19:59,244
How can this be?

1488
03:20:07,968 --> 03:20:10,198
I know this man.

1489
03:20:23,768 --> 03:20:25,565
Will someone help Him?

1490
03:20:32,768 --> 03:20:33,996
Take pity on Him.

1491
03:20:41,128 --> 03:20:42,880
Have mercy.

1492
03:21:04,128 --> 03:21:05,959
In His pain...

1493
03:21:06,608 --> 03:21:08,883
...this look of peace.

1494
03:21:10,888 --> 03:21:12,685
Watch over them, Esther.

1495
03:21:49,168 --> 03:21:50,396
We must go back.

1496
03:21:50,608 --> 03:21:52,883
I brought you here to this...

1497
03:21:53,568 --> 03:21:55,206
...when I hoped...

1498
03:21:58,008 --> 03:22:00,283
You haven't failed, Esther.

1499
03:22:18,088 --> 03:22:20,556
Hail King of the Jews!

1500
03:24:52,128 --> 03:24:55,518
This is where your search
has brought you, Balthasar.

1501
03:25:02,048 --> 03:25:03,766
He gave me water...

1502
03:25:04,528 --> 03:25:06,439
...and a heart to live.

1503
03:25:09,288 --> 03:25:11,085
What has He done to merit this?

1504
03:25:13,208 --> 03:25:16,803
He has taken the world
of our sins onto Himself.

1505
03:25:18,008 --> 03:25:20,761
To this end He said He was born...

1506
03:25:21,968 --> 03:25:23,799
...in that stable...

1507
03:25:24,488 --> 03:25:26,524
...where I first saw Him.

1508
03:25:30,008 --> 03:25:33,205
For this cause,
He came into the world.

1509
03:25:39,688 --> 03:25:41,360
For this death?

1510
03:25:44,048 --> 03:25:45,481
This beginning.

1511
03:26:16,688 --> 03:26:18,679
I have lived too long.

1512
03:26:48,528 --> 03:26:51,486
As though He were carrying
in that cross...

1513
03:26:51,688 --> 03:26:53,804
...the pain of the world.

1514
03:26:55,208 --> 03:26:59,565
So fearful, and yet why is it...

1515
03:26:59,768 --> 03:27:01,963
...I'm not afraid anymore?

1516
03:27:10,848 --> 03:27:13,078
The shadow of a storm.

1517
03:27:37,648 --> 03:27:39,798
A strange darkness...

1518
03:27:40,008 --> 03:27:41,885
...but still day.

1519
03:27:50,488 --> 03:27:52,604
His life is over.

1520
03:28:13,008 --> 03:28:14,236
What is it?

1521
03:28:22,968 --> 03:28:24,526
This tearing.

1522
03:28:25,408 --> 03:28:27,205
I am in pain.

1523
03:28:28,128 --> 03:28:30,084
I feel it too.

1524
03:29:13,128 --> 03:29:14,846
Do you see your hand?

1525
03:31:46,808 --> 03:31:49,163
Almost at the moment He died...

1526
03:31:50,608 --> 03:31:53,964
...i heard Him say,
"Father, forgive them...

1527
03:31:54,168 --> 03:31:56,398
...for they know not what they do."

1528
03:31:58,528 --> 03:32:00,007
Even then.

1529
03:32:00,248 --> 03:32:01,647
Even then.

1530
03:32:07,088 --> 03:32:11,400
And i felt His voice take
the sword out of my hand.
