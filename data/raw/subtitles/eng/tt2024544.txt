1
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,535
All right now.
Y'all fresh niggers.

2
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,245
Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang.

3
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,457
Very simple.
I want you to take your knife.

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,371
Get in them cane.

5
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,415
Make it sing.

6
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,459
Take the cane out.

7
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,922
Cut my tops.

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,213
Clean the shucks off.

9
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,013
Throw it on a pile for the planting gang.

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,769
Now, them cane ain't gonna jump up
and bite you.

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,928
Don't shy back.

12
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,938

Into bed.

41
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,026
Into bed.
Thank you for the music.

42
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,437
Come on.
Ouch.

43
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,230
Get in there.
Come on.

44
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,024
Give me a kiss.

45
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,737
I love you, Margaret.

46
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,614
I love you, too.

47
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,874
Sleep well.

48
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,207
I'll take this.

49
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,425
I don't want to hear any more noise.

50
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,059
Three weeks and two days.

51
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,395
It is the custom.

52
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,810
I wonder what you will do without me.

53
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,612
I won't stay idle.

54
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,237
Darling, it's good money.

55
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,572
If only I didn't have to share
your cooking with other people.

56
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,996
You don't.

57
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,924
Be good for your mother.
Okay, Alonzo?

58
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,921
Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.

59
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,588
Travel safely.

60
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,177
Stay safely.

61
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,765
Ready?

62
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,087
Devil call his name, there he is now.

63
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,455
Mr. Northup!

64
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,332
I have two gentlemen whose
acquaintance you should make.

65
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,493
Misters Brown and Hamilton.

66
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,786
Sir.

67
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,378
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen were
inquiring about distinguished individuals,

68
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,114
and I was just this very moment
saying Solomon Northup,

69
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:07,985
is an expert player on the violin.
He was indeed.

70
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,132
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

71
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,222
Well, taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty,

72
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,389
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?

73
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,807
Of course.

74
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,349
Good day.

75
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,980
A circus?

76
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,286
That is our usual employee.

77
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,858
The company currently
in the city of Washington.

78
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,739
Circus is too constricting a word,

79
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,401
to describe the talented and
merry band with which we travel.

80
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,491
It is a spectacle unlike most
have ever witnessed.

81
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,074
Creatures from the darkest Africa
as yet unseen by civilized man.

82
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,662
Acrobats from the Orient,

83
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,845
who contort themselves in the
most confounding manners.

84
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,972
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown

85
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,550
an internationally renowned practitioner
in the art of prestidigitation.

86
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,988
We are on our way thither to rejoin
the company having left for a short time

87
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,982
to make a small profit
from our own exhibitions.

88
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,728
The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon...

89
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,512
Yes, we had just a devil of a time in
procuring music for our entertainments.

90
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,180
Men of true talents are seemingly in short supply.

91
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,082
Thank you, sir.

92
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,939
If we could persuade you to accompany us
as far as Washington.

93
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,525
We could give you one dollar
for each day's services

94
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,087
and three dollars for every night
played at our performances.

95
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,084
In addition, we would provide sufficient pay

96
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,204
for your return here to Saratoga,
two weeks from today.

97
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,620
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

98
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,429
Hamilton, you know too much.

99
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,089
Some say not enough.

100
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,973
Solomon, 43 dollars.
All to you.

101
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,062
That is far more than my wages amount to.

102
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,768
It's been a most profitable week, sir.

103
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,225
Cheers.
Cheers.

104
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,608
Cheers.

105
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,732
Another.

106
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,281
Gentlemen, your generosity is extraordinary.

107
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,494
And your talents are undeniable.

108
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,704
To Solomon.

109
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,370
Cheers.

110
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,665
It's all right, Solomon.

111
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,957
There's no shame in it.

112
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,546
No shame at all.

113
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,517
Hamilton, we must hurry.

114
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,460
One too many libation.

115
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,836
We're halfway there.

116
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,104
So sorry...

117
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,140
We won't hear it.
We won't.

118
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,318
Let him sleep, Hamilton.

119
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,892
A good night's rest.

120
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,147
And tomorrow...

121
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:50,896
tomorrow you will feel as well and
refreshed as if the earth were new again.

122
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,815
Hamilton, there's nothing more we can do for him.

123
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,001
Such is the pity.

124
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,331
Well, boy, how do you feel now?

125
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,591
My name...
My name is Solomon Northup.

126
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,007
I'm a free man.
A resident of Saratoga, New York.

127
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,801
The residence of my wife and
children who are equally free.

128
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,845
And you have no right whatsoever
to detain me.

129
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,389
You're not any free man.

130
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,852
And I promise you...

131
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,482
I promise you upon my liberation
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.

132
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,614
Resolve this.

133
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,570
Produce your papers.

134
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,242
You're no free man.

135
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,832
And you ain't from Saratoga.

136
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,247
You're from Georgia.

137
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,503
You ain't a free man.

138
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,388
You're nothing but a Georgia runaway.

139
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,100
You're just a... runaway nigger,

140
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,517
from Georgia.

141
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,472
You're a slave!

142
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,612
You're a Georgia slave!

143
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,035
Are you a slave?

144
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,495
No.

145
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,051
Help.

146
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,020
Help me.

147
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,186
Help me!

148
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,227
Somebody help me!

149
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,063
Help!

150
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,358
Help!

151
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,876
That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters.

152
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,508
You need something proper to wear.

153
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,884
Go on, put it on.

154
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,576
There.

155
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,326
That's fine.

156
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,704
That's fine.

157
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,078
Got no gratitude?

158
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,501
No.
That's from my wife.

159
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,215
Rags and tatters.

160
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,884
Rags and tatters.

161
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,642
Go on, wash up.

162
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,363
The boy, too.
Get him clean.

163
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,401
Scrub now.

164
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,741
Do you know when my mama will come?

165
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,296
Hush him up!

166
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,322
Mama!
Mama!

167
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,490
Quiet.

168
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,125
Quiet, please.
Mama!

169
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,410
Hush him up!

170
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,956
Your mother will come, I swear she will.
But you must be silent.

171
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,007
Be silent.

172
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,607
We need a sympathetic ear.

173
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,469
An opportunity to explain our situation.

174
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,637
Who, in your estimation, is that sympathetic ear?

175
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,522
The two men I journeyed with.

176
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,971
I'm certain they're making
inquiries at this very moment.

177
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,377
I'd be just as certain they're counting the
money paid for delivering you to this place.

178
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,935
They were not kidnappers, they were artists.
Fellow performers.

179
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,408
You know that?

180
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,526
You know for certain who they were?

181
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,370
The reality to come is us
being transported southward.

182
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,626
New Orleans, if I was to venture.

183
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,746
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.

184
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,539
And beyond that...

185
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,935
Well, I suppose once in a slave state,
there's only one outcome.

186
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:47,714
No.

187
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,877
I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John.

188
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,465
Yeah, for y'all there ain't nothing
but John wasn't kidnapped.

189
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:55,897
John's just being held as debt, that's all.

190
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,133
Master pay his debt and John be redeemed.

191
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,630
Boy, our masters will not come for us.

192
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,734
John, John is sorry for y'all but that's how it be,
where you're going, you're going without John.

193
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,113
Mama!
Randall!

194
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,858
Mama!

195
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,407
Are you all right?

196
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,450
Are you all right?

197
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,703
Thank you, God.

198
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,411
Come on.
Get up.

199
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,292
I said, get up!
No, don't...

200
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,378
I don't want to hear you talk!
Get in the yard.

201
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,587
Not my children!

202
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,095
Ain't no need for all that.
Just taking a little trip, that's all.

203
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,091
Don't want to frighten the children
over a little boat ride, do you?

204
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,930
John's master gonna pay his debt.

205
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,094
Line up!

206
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,445
His master gonna pay his debt!

207
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,941
I don't want to hear a word out of none of you!

208
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,281
Not a one.

209
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,879
All right, come on.

210
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,291
Move.
Come on.

211
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,377
Come on, child.
Come on.

212
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,046
Follow your mama.

213
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,271
Come on, boy.

214
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,356
Up these stairs.

215
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,634
Get down out of that wagon.
Come on.

216
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,636
Come on.
Move it!

217
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,479
Let's go! Come on.

218
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,980
Up, up the stairs.

219
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,770
Come on, let's go.

220
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,773
Come on, move it!

221
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,691
All right, come on.

222
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,741
Hey, you. Go on.
Get up.

223
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,822
Sit down, right there.

224
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,166
Come on.

225
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,583
Right there.
Just sit down.

226
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,084
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

227
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,428
If you want to survive,
do and say as little as possible.

228
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:45,138
Tell no one who you really are and
tell no one you can read and write.

229
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,242
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.

230
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,334
Now keep your mouth shut.

231
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,927
I say we fight.

232
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,422
The crew is fairly small.

233
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,608
Were it well planned,
I believe they could be strong-armed.

234
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,510
Three can't go against the whole crew.

235
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,638
The rest here are niggers.

236
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,349
Born and bred slaves.

237
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,768
Niggers ain't got no stomach for a fight.

238
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,277
Not a damn one.

239
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,235
All's I know, if we get where we're traveling...

240
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,070
we'll wish we'd died trying.

241
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,702
Survival's not about certain death,

242
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,322
it's about keeping your head down.

243
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,127
Days ago, I was with my family...

244
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,460
in my home.

245
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,343
Now you tell me all is lost.

246
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,681
"Tell no one who I am."
That's the way to survive?

247
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,974
Well, I don't want to survive.

248
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,642
I want to live.

249
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,070
Better off.

250
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,571
Better than us.

251
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,836
I don't see him.

252
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,720
Clemens!

253
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,717
Clemens Ray!
Master.

254
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,097
Clemens!
Master Ray, sir!

255
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,509
Master Ray!

256
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,796
Who's in charge here?

257
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,927
I'm the captain!

258
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,266
I'm Mr.
Jonus Ray.

259
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,022
My solicitor has documentation,

260
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,933
verifying the Negro known as
Clemens Ray is my property.

261
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,444
I know nothing of this arrangement.

262
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,454
You are ordered to return that property

263
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,231
immediately or be charged with thievery.

264
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,693
Free him!

265
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,737
Master.

266
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,702
Master Ray, sir.

267
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,083
Clemens!

268
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,442
Clemens!
Get him back!

269
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,954
Clemens!

270
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,621
Clemens!

271
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,381
Clemens!

272
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,083
Mr. Parker.

273
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,408
Ah, Mr. Northup.
Mrs. Northup.

274
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,701
Solomon, could I interest you in a new cravat?

275
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,173
Pure silk, by way of the French.

276
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,872
We're in need of a fresh
carry all for my Mrs.'s travels.

277
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,876
Nothing more.

278
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,708
The year has passed already.

279
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,180
Off to work at Sandy Hill again?

280
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,047
I am.

281
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,549
I have just the thing.

282
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:10,012
Something to suit your style and yet
sturdy enough for the 40-mile round trip.

283
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,171
It's beautiful.

284
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,260
At what price?

285
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,348
We will take it.

286
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,636
Children, come see what you
father has just purchased for me.

287
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,363
One moment, sir, and you'll be assisted.

288
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,188
Mr. Parker.
Sir?

289
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,564
If we could discuss the price.

290
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,350
Oh, forgive me, Solomon.
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

291
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,565
A customer waits.
Welcome, sir.

292
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,570
Shop well, sir, but mind your wallet.

293
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,530
Pay no attention to this gentleman's nonsense.

294
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,740
Jasper!

295
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,032
My regrets for the intrusion, sir.

296
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,076
No intrusion.

297
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,376
Good day, sir.

298
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,041
Good day.

299
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,921
Jasper, out.

300
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,341
Very good.
Very good.

301
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,265
Let's see, here.
Eliza!

302
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,893
Stand up when you hear your name.
Eliza.

303
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,606
Lethe!

304
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:07,690
John.

305
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,690
Oren.

306
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,112
Platt.

307
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,120
Platt.

308
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,742
Stand up.

309
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,124
You fit the description given.

310
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,630
Why didn't you answer when called?

311
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,040
My name is not Platt.

312
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,049
My name...

313
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,094
Your name is Platt.

314
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,470
Captain, get these niggers to my cart.

315
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,830
Move.

316
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:07,796
I believe I have something very much
to your liking in the back room.

317
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,673
Follow me, please.

318
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,400
Yes.

319
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,500
Now inspect them at your leisure, but...

320
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:17,838
I ask you to pay particular
regard to young Ezra here.

321
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,091
Incredibly sound limbs.

322
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,352
I have never seen anything quite like him.

323
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,354
And this marvelous creature.
Can you believe it?

324
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,186
She'll make a fine lady's maid.

325
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,520
Madam?

326
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,522
So, inspect at your leisure.

327
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,983
Take your time.
Help yourself to refreshments.

328
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,149
Gentlemen, what catches your fancy here?

329
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,650
This boy?
Yes?

330
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,990
Open your mouth.
Open wider.

331
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,530
Look in there.
Never been sick a day in his life.

332
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,340
And I call particular attention to Martha.

333
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,834
She is an excellent pastry cook.

334
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,711
Ah, Mr. Ford.

335
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,459
Splendid seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?

336
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,670
This lad?
He's very brawny.

337
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,644
How much for the ones Platt and Eliza?

338
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,216
Ah, yes.

339
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,856
A thousand for Platt.

340
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,680
This is a nigger of considerable talent,
I assure you.

341
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,561
700 for Eliza.

342
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,393
My fairest price.

343
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,896
You will accept a note?

344
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,652
Please, sir.
Do not divide my family.

345
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,063
Do not take me unless you take my children.

346
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
Eliza!
Quiet!

347
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,117
You will have the most faithful slave in me.

348
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,617
The most faithful slave that has ever lived.

349
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,901
But I beg that you do not separate us.

350
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,074
Your price for the boy?

351
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,579
Eliza! Stop it!

352
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,910
I will give you something to cry about.

353
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,245
Randall, come forward.
Come, come, come.

354
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,627
Now, do you see how fit this boy is?

355
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,037
Like ripe fruit.

356
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,082
May I take your stick a moment?
Observe this.

357
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,250
Randall, jump, jump, jump.
Run, run, run.

358
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,590
Very good!
Higher.

359
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:38,879
Now, you see this.

360
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,641
It's very likely he will grow into a fine beast.

361
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,602
600 for the boy.

362
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,263
Fair and final.

363
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,105
Done.

364
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,608
Superb.
A moment, please.

365
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,064
Mr. Ford.

366
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,440
Please.
Eliza!

367
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,413
How much for the little girl?

368
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,530
Ah...

369
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,111
You have no use for her.

370
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,947
One so young will bring you no profit.

371
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,952
No, no, no.
I cannot sell the girl.

372
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,741
No, there's heaps and piles
of money to be made from her.

373
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,205
She's a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.

374
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,168
None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated,
cotton-picking niggers, here.

375
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,961
Her child, man.

376
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,125
Please.

377
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,371
For God's sake, are you not
sentimental in the least?

378
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,130
My sentimentality extends he length of a coin.

379
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,798
God, please.

380
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,719
Now do you take this lot,
Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them?

381
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,480
Please, please.
Please.

382
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,186
I will take the ones Platt and Eliza.

383
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,350
Sold, Eliza and Platt.

384
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,643
I will not go without my children!

385
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,860
God damn sniveling wench!

386
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,287
You will not take them from me!

387
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,031
God damn you!
Get her out of here, Cape!

388
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,908
Please!
No! No!

389
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,694
Get her out of here, god damn it!

390
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,830
Platt, get your fiddle.
Play, play, play something.

391
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,083
I will give you something to cry about,
you god damned witch!

392
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,415
Get her out of here, Cape!
Out, now!

393
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,040
Mama! Mama! Mama!

394
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,963
Yes.

395
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,845
Mr. Ford, a pleasure.

396
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,693
Did you bring all those niggers?

397
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,109
Two of them?
You got two?

398
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,822
Mr. Chapin.

399
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,913
This one's crying.
Why is this one crying?

400
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,698
Separated from her children.

401
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,287
Oh, clear.
It couldn't be helped.

402
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,702
Poor, poor woman.

403
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,120
Mr. Chapin.
Yes, sir.

404
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,373
Tomorrow, you have to take these two
up to the mill and start them working.

405
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,756
For now, make them adequate.

406
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,716
Fix them a meal
and have them rest themselves.

407
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,048
Yes, sir.

408
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,178
Come on, now.

409
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,886
Come on!
Don't dawdle!

410
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,802
Something to eat, and some rest.

411
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,608
Your children will soon be forgotten.

412
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,000
For all of you raw niggers that don't know,

413
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:25,546
my name is John Tibeats,
William Ford's chief carpenter.

414
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,091
You will refer to me as "Master."

415
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,978
Mr. Chapin is the overseer on this plantation.

416
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:37,687
You, too, will refer to him as "Master."

417
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,731
So, clap your hands.

418
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,991
Like this.
Come on.

419
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,115
Come on, now.
Clap your hands.

447
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:12,658
"I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob."

448
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:18,371
"And when the multitude heard this,
they were astonished at his doctrine."

449
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,170
"And then one of them, which was a lawyer"

450
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,549
"asked him a question, tempting him."

451
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,769
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail.

452
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,485
Even with a boat full of load.

453
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,944
The distance from the work area to
the point on the latter bayou

454
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,822
is several miles by water fewer than land.

455
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,242
It occurs to me that the expense of
transportation would be materially diminished...

456
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,448
"Materially diminished"?

457
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,578
If we use the waterway.

458
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,490
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

459
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,287
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

460
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,626
Let the man say his piece.

461
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,464
It's a scheme, plenty of engineers
have schemed similarly.

462
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,175
The passes are too tight.

463
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,633
I reckon them at more than 12 feet
at their most narrow.

464
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,848
Wide enough for a tub to traverse
if a team of niggers cleared it out.

465
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,763
And you know what of transport
and terraforming?

466
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,648
I labored repairing the Champlain canal

467
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,152
on the section over which William
van Nortwick was superintendent.

468
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,189
With my earnings, I hired several
efficient hands to assist me

469
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:17,702
and entered into contracts for the transportation of
large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy.

470
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,492
Well, I'll admit to being
impressed even if you won't.

471
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,582
Collect a team.
See what good you can do.

472
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,922
You good?
Clear it out!

473
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,356
Two, three.

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,298
Platt, you are a marvel.

483
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,682
What took you so long?

484
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,306
Thank you, Master Ford.

485
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,204
Platt.

486
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,635
My great thanks, Master Ford.

487
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,895
No, my thanks to you.

488
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,351
And it is the least of it.

489
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,768
I hope it brings us both much joy
over the years.

490
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,636
God!

491
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,642
Eliza.

492
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,979
Eliza.

493
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,730
Stop!

494
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,149
Stop your wailing!

495
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,621
If you let yourself be overcome
by sorrow, you will drown in it.

496
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,497
Have you stopped crying for your children?

497
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,829
You make no sounds, but will you
ever let them go in your heart?

498
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,001
They are as my flesh.

499
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,170
Then who is distressed?

500
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,174
Do I upset the master and the mistress?

501
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,684
Do you care less about my loss
than their well-being?

502
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,185
Master Ford is a decent man.

503
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,470
He is a slaver!

504
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,654
Under the circumstances.

505
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,477
Under the circumstances, he is a slaver.

506
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,683
But you truckle at his boot.

507
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,477
You luxuriate in his favour.

508
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,362
I survive!

509
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,568
I will not fall into despair!

510
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,699
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford!

511
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,657
I will keep myself hearty
until freedom is opportune!

512
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,867
Ford is your opportunity?

513
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,409
You think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest?

514
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,248
But he does nothing for you.

515
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,582
Nothing.

516
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,504
You are no better than prized livestock.

517
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,418
Call for him.
Call!

518
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,712
Tell him of your previous circumstances,

519
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,051
and see what it earns you, Solomon.

520
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,392
So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then?

521
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,615
My back is thick with scars,

522
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,063
for protesting my freedom.

523
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,648
Do not accuse me.

524
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,073
I accuse you of nothing.
I cannot accuse.

525
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,156
I have done dishonorable things to survive

526
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,322
and for all of them I have ended up here.

527
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,871
No better than if I stood up for myself.

528
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,745
God, forgive me.

529
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,710
Solomon, let me weep for my children!

530
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,185
"Whosoever, therefore, shall humble"

531
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,429
"himself as this little child"

532
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,775
"the same is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven."

533
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:03,860
"And who so shall receive one
such little child in my name..."

534
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,865
I cannot have that kind of depression about.

535
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,197
"But who so shall offend one of these little ones"

536
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,254
"it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck..."

537
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,125
"and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."

538
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,202
Amen.

539
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,917
Amen.

540
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,811
Make them boards flush.

541
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,141
They are, sir.

542
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,306
No, they is no such thing.

543
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,061
They are as smooth to the touch
as a yearling's coat.

544
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,569
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

545
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,829
It's all a matter of perspective, sir.

546
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,131
From where you stand,
you may see differently,

547
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,783
but the hands are not mistaken.

548
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,580
I simply ask that you use all your
senses before rendering judgment.

549
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,342
Oh, my, you are a brute.

550
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,428
You are a dog.

551
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,762
And no better for following instruction!

552
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,193
I do as ordered.

553
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,418
Then you'll be up at daybreak.

554
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,351
You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin,

555
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,516
and commence to putting on clapboards.

556
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,854
Yes, sir.

557
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,987
Make them boards flush.

558
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,369
No, please!
Please, Sam!

559
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,880
Where am I going?
Where am I going, Sam?

560
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,875
Solomon! Solomon!

561
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,713
Solomon!

562
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,342
Solomon!

563
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
Solomon!

564
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,818
When I say I had my Master's favor,
you understand.

565
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:13,469
And for nine years he blessed me
with every comfort and luxury in life.

566
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,431
Silks and jewels and even
servants to wait upon us.

567
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,331
Such was our life.

568
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,373
And the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.

569
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,715
But Master Berry's daughter...

570
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,549
she always looked at me with an unkind nature.

571
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:40,061
And she hated Emily, no matter she
and Emily were flesh of flesh.

572
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,601
As Master Berry's health failed,
she gained power of the household,

573
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:52,569
and eventually, I was brought to the city under the
false pretense of our free papers being executed.

574
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,909
My poor children.

575
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,614
I thought I told you to commence
to putting on clapboards.

576
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:44,500
Yes, Master, I'm about it.
These have all been replaced.

577
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,913
And didn't I tell you to get a keg of nails?

578
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,752
And so, I did.

579
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,924
So, you did.

580
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,674
God damn you.
I thought you know something!

581
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,338
I did as instructed.

582
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,725
If there's something wrong,
it's wrong with the instruction.

583
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,177
You black bastard.

584
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,600
You goddamn black bastard.

585
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,814
Strip your clothes.

586
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,317
Strip.

587
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,861
I will not.

588
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:32,542
You will not live to see another day, nigger!

589
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,674
Help!

590
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,716
Murder!

591
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,011
I'm sorry!

592
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,889
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

593
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,526
What is the matter?

594
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,190
What is the matter?

595
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,040
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me.

596
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,987
This ain't done by half.

597
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,664
I will have flesh.

598
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,075
And I will have all of it!

599
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,837
Do not stir.

600
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,709
Do not leave the plantation.
For, if you run, I cannot protect you.

601
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,756
Stay here.

602
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,073
Gentlemen, whoever moves
that nigger is a dead man.

603
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,870
I am the overseer on this plantation.

604
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,751
William Ford holds the mortgage on Platt.

605
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,668
If you hang him, he will lose his debt.

606
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,503
You have no claim to his life.

607
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,505
As for you two...

608
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,672
if you have any regard for your own safety.

609
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,805
I say, be gone!

610
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,227
You got no cause!

611
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,856
Platt is mine, and mine to do with as I please!

612
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,937
If you touch...

613
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:22,964
Sam!

614
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,092
Fetch the mule.
Get Master Ford.

615
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,266
Platt.
Poor Platt.

616
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,347
I believe Tibeats is skulking
about the premises somewhere.

617
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,726
He wants you dead, and he will have it so.

618
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,103
It's no longer safe for you here.

619
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,061
And I don't believe you will
remain passive if Tibeats attacks.

620
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,273
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.

621
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,358
He will take charge.

622
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,714
Master Ford.

623
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,840
You must know that I'm not a slave.

624
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,345
I cannot hear that.

625
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,476
Before I came to you, I was a freeman.

626
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,309
I'm trying to save your life!

627
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,021
And I have a debt to be mindful of.

628
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,442
And that is to Edwin Epps now.

629
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,403
And he is a hard man.
Prides himself on being a nigger breaker.

630
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,615
But truthfully, I could find
no others who would take you.

631
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,697
You've made a reputation of yourself.

632
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:07,165
Whatever the circumstances,
you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

633
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,878
But I fear no good will come of it.

634
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,403
"And that servant..."

635
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,115
"which knew his lord's will..."

636
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,953
Which knew his lord's will.

637
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,710
"...and prepared not himself..."

638
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,876
Prepared not himself.

639
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,596
"...neither did according to his will..."

640
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,725
"shall be beaten with many stripes."

641
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,524
Do you hear that?

642
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,526
"Stripes."

643
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,897
That nigger that don't obey his lord.

644
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,111
That's his master, do you see?

645
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:23,617
That there nigger shall be
beaten with many stripes.

646
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,039
Now, "many" signifies a great many.

647
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,422
40, 100, 150 lashes.

648
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,678
That's scripture.

649
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,608
Pick that cotton.

650
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,694
Move along, now.

651
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,786
Come on, Edward!
Drive them niggers!

652
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,949
Pick that cotton!
Move along, now.

653
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,625
What are you doing, boy?
Come on!

654
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,672
240 for Bob.

655
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,091
What you got for James?

656
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,628
295 pounds.

657
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,843
That's real good, boy.
That's real good.

658
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,592
182 for Platt.

659
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,097
How much can even an
average nigger pick a day?

660
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,515
200 pounds.

661
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,558
This nigger ain't even average.

662
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,649
512 pounds for Patsey.

663
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,486
512!

664
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,404
You menfolk got no shame
letting Patsey out-pick you.

665
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:51,538
The day ain't yet come she
swung lower than 500 pounds.

666
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,339
Queen of the fields, she is.

667
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,544
138 pounds...

668
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,459
I ain't done, Treach.

669
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,763
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate
on the work Patsey done?

670
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,469
Yes, sir.

671
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,187
Damn queen.

672
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,684
Born and bred to the field.

673
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,604
A nigger among niggers.

674
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,691
And God gave her to me.

675
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,786
A lesson in the rewards of righteous living.

676
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,961
All be observant to that.

677
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,047
All!

678
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,376
Now, Treach.
Now speak.

679
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,089
138 pounds for Phebe.

680
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,892
Hit 145 yesterday.
Pull her out.

681
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,719
206 pounds for George.

682
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,059
How much he pick yesterday?

683
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,566
229.

684
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,896
Get him out.

685
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,481
Come on, get.

686
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,818
Come on.

687
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,779
Come on, boy, move!

688
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,016
Get up!

689
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,643
We dance tonight!
Get up!

690
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,304
Get your fiddle, Platt.
Get up!

691
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,518
Come on!
Get, get, get!

692
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,523
Come on, Platt.
Come on!

693
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,323
Come on, where's your merriment?
Move your feet!

694
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,420
Sell her.

695
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,588
What's all this?

696
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,258
You will sell the Negress.

697
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,222
Sell little Pats?

698
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,104
She pick with more vigor than any other nigger.

699
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,405
Choose another to go.

700
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,057
No other.

701
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,567
Sell her.

702
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,311
I will not.

703
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,532
You will remove that black
bitch from this property

704
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,614
or I'll take myself back to Cheneyville.

705
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,661
Back to that hog's trough where I found you?

706
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,498
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.

707
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,257
Because I will rid myself of you

708
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,263
well before I do away with her.

709
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,727
What you looking at?

710
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,689
Damn woman.

711
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,570
I won't have my mood spoiled.

712
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,822
I will not.

713
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,031
Dance.

714
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,902
Dance, I says!

715
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,950
Come on!

716
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,511
Pick it up, Platt.
Play that fiddle, boy.

717
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,115
Platt.

718
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,460
Yes, Mistress?

719
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,045
Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?

720
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,918
I can, ma'am.

721
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,086
This is a list of goods and sundries.

722
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,177
You will take it to be filled
and return immediately.

723
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,558
Take your tag.

724
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,514
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.

725
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,678
Yes, Mistress.

726
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,940
Where you from, Platt?

727
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,311
I told you.

728
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,229
Tell me again.

729
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,772
Washington.

730
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:56,906
Who were your master?

731
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,990
Master name a Freeman.

732
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,901
Was he a learned man?

733
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,328
I suppose so.

734
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,909
He learn you to read?

735
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,993
A word, here or there.

736
01:03:08,335 --> 01:03:10,095
But I have no understanding
of the written...

737
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,339
Don't trouble yourself with it.

738
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,293
Same as the rest, Master brought
you here to work, that's all.

739
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,134
Any more will earn you 100 lashes.

740
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,113
Come here, boy.

741
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,459
Come on.

742
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,307
Where you going, boy?

743
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,972
On my way to Bartholomew's.

744
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,391
Sent by Mistress Epps.

745
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,154
You best get there, then.

746
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,824
Get there quick.

747
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,208
Any trouble?

748
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,869
No, ma'am.
No trouble.

749
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,312
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

750
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,768
Good morning, Master Shaw.

751
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,400
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?

752
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,775
You may.

753
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,864
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

754
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,623
Nigger Platt.

755
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,580
Patsey, Master wishes you to return.

756
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,369
The Sabbath day, I is free to roam.

757
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,539
Master sent me running to fetch
you, said no time should be wasted.

758
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,416
Drink of tea?

759
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,459
Thank you, Mistress,
but I don't dare.

760
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:31,669
Would you know of Master Epps's consternation
to be any lessened with your timely return?

761
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,930
Anger's his constant condition.

762
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:35,889
Sit.

763
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,642
Sit and drink the tea that I offered.

764
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,954
What'n be Epps's concern?

765
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,490
I'd rather not say.

766
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,321
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
All things in moderation.

767
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,120
As you are aware...

768
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:03,665
Master Epps is a man of hard countenance.

769
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,670
You know he has ill feeling towards your husband.

770
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,085
He do.

771
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,096
Master Epps has somehow come to believe

772
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:15,259
that Master Shaw is something of a Lothario.

773
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,312
A misguided belief, no doubt.

774
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,642
No doubt...

775
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,933
if not born out of truth itself.

776
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,777
I meant no disrespect.

777
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,984
He ain't heard you.

778
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,666
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.

779
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,164
Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.

780
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:43,503
I ain't felt the end of a lash
in more years I can recall.

781
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,755
I ain't worked a field, neither.

782
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:51,257
Where once I served now,
I have others serving me.

783
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,472
The cost to my current existence,

784
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,760
be Master Shaw broadcasting his affections,

785
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,769
and me enjoying the pantomime of his fidelity.

786
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:06,564
If that what keep me from cotton
picking niggers, that what it be.

787
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,447
A small and reasonable price
to be paid, for sure.

788
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:20,164
I know what it like to be the object of
Master's predilections and peculiarities.

789
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,952
A lusty visit in the night,

790
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,487
or a visitation with the whip.

791
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,502
Take comfort, Patsey.

792
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,877
The good Lord will manage Epps.

793
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:36,886
In His own time, the good
Lord will manage them all.

794
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,427
The curse of the pharaohs were a poor example

795
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,517
of what wait for the plantation class.

796
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,608
This is nice.

797
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,497
Pats.
Patsey!

798
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,332
Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.

799
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,705
Patsey!
Found her, Master.

800
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,503
And brought her back, just as instructed.

801
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,213
What did you just now tell her?

802
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,052
What did you say to Pats?

803
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,967
No words were spoken, none of consequence.

804
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,353
You're a liar.

805
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,647
You damn liar.

806
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,688
I saw you talking with her.

807
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,190
Tell me.

808
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,531
I cannot speak of what did not occur.

809
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,567
I'll cut your black throat!

810
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,860
Master!

811
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,824
You come here.

812
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,355
Master Epps.
I said come here!

813
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,888
I brought her back, just like you...

814
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,709
Come here!
Master!

815
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,912
Master.

816
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,835
I got her, just as instructed.

817
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,211
Master Epps!

818
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,005
You stay away from Pats, boy.

819
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,562
Master Epps.

820
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,249
It's the Lord's day.

821
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,588
Ain't nothing Christian in us carrying on like this.

822
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,020
I concede to you.

823
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,020
In the name of valor...

824
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:54,901
help your master to his feet.

825
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,691
I'm gonna kill you!

826
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,694
What's the fuss?

827
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,327
Master Epps believed Patsey and me
to be in conversation when we were not.

828
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,241
I tried to explain, but it's led to all this.

829
01:12:08,307 --> 01:12:09,149
What is it?

830
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,044
You can't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?

831
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,013
You are a no-account bastard.

832
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,040
A filthy, godless heathen.

833
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,835
My bed is too holy for you to share.

834
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,093
What's he been telling you?

835
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,596
Of your misbegotten ways.

836
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,756
And he would know what of anything?

837
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,759
I ain't even spoken with him today.

838
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,429
You lying nigger, Platt.

839
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,188
Have I?

840
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,775
Have I?

841
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,776
There.
There's all the truth he got.

842
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,025
Damn nigger.

843
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,138
Patsey.

844
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,344
A moment from the dancing.

845
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,761
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

846
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,738
Thank you, Mistress.

847
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:41,864
Thank you, Mistress.

848
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,017
There will be none for you, Patsey.

849
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,020
You see that?

850
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,193
You see that look of insolence she give me?

851
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,525
I seen nothing but her turn away.

852
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,910
Are you blind or ignorant?

853
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,367
It was hot, hateful scorn.

854
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,624
It filled that black face.

855
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:05,539
You tell me you didn't see it, it's because you
choose not to look, or are you saying I lie?

856
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,048
Whatever it was, it passed.

857
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,460
Is that how you are with the niggers?

858
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:15,218
Letting every ill thought
fester inside them?

859
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,387
Look at them.

860
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,723
They foul with it.

861
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,979
They foul with their hate.

862
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,726
You let it be, it's gonna come
back to us in the dark of night.

863
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,439
You want that?

864
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:34,655
You want them black animals leave us gut
like pigs in our own sleep?

865
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:40,073
You are man less.

866
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,913
A damn eunuch if there ever was.

867
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,250
If you won't stand for me, I pray you'd
at least be a credit to your own kind

868
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,632
and beat every foul thought from them.

869
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,093
Beat it from them!

870
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,119
Eat.

871
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,989
Fill yourselves.

872
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,033
And then we dance.

873
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,708
I said, eat.

874
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:47,973
Platt.

875
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,064
Platt, you awake?

876
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,902
I am.

877
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,239
I have a request.

878
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,908
An act of kindness.

879
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,876
I secreted it from the mistress.

880
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,329
Return it.

881
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,169
It yours, Platt.

882
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,172
For what cause?

883
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:19,510
All I ask, end my life.

884
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,934
Take my body to
the margin of the swamp.

885
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:27,097
Take me by the throat,
hold me low in the water

886
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,937
until I is still and without life.

887
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,268
Bury me in a lonely place of dying.

888
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,232
I will do no such thing.

889
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,189
The gory detail with which you speak.

890
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,859
I thought on it long and hard.

891
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,203
It is melancholia.

892
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,281
Nothing more.

893
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,247
How can you fall into such despair?

894
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,459
How can you not know?

895
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,552
I ain't got no comfort in this life.

896
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:04,884
If I can't buy mercy from you.

897
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,144
I'll beg it.

898
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,896
There are others.

899
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,398
Beg them.
I'm begging you.

900
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,729
Why?

901
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:17,238
Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an ungodly request?

902
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,398
There is God here!

903
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,657
God is merciful...

904
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,447
and he forgive merciful acts.

905
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,325
Won't be no hell for you.

906
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,662
Do it.

907
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,799
Do what I ain't got the strength to do myself.

908
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,961
It's a plague.

909
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,008
It's cotton worm.

910
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,970
It's a plague.
It's damn biblical.

911
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:31,019
Two seasons God done sent a plague to smite me.

912
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:36,976
What I done that God hates me so?

913
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,321
It's that godless lot.

914
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,037
They brought this on me.

915
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,494
I bring them God's word and heathens

916
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,868
they are, they bring me God's scorn.

917
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,539
Damn!

918
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,416
Damn you!

919
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,211
Damn all y'all!

920
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:31,989
Judge.

921
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,828
Mister Epps.

922
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:39,417
I am deeply saddened
to hear about your misfortune.

923
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,091
Your price don't reflect your concern.

924
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,169
Listen up.

925
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:47,713
You're Judge Turner's for the season.

926
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,681
More, if need be, until my crops return.

927
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,760
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.

928
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,850
Don't bring no biblical plagues to him, you hear?

929
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,107
Or I'll take it out on your skin.

930
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:00,521
Get out.

931
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,421
Get off the porch.
You ain't supposed to be on the porch.

932
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,743
Get off the porch.

933
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:03,797
Platt, is it?

934
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,290
Yes, sir.

935
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,461
You cultivate cane previously?

936
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,133
No, sir, I have not.

937
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,468
It comes to you quite naturally.

938
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,632
Are you educated?

939
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,678
No, sir.
Niggers are hired to work, not read or write.

940
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,140
You play the fiddle.

941
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,438
Yes, sir.
Yes, I do.

942
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:30,445
Willard Yarner, a planter up the bayou
celebrates his anniversary in three weeks' time.

943
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,860
I'll hold out your name to him.

944
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,620
What you earn is yours to keep.

945
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,372
Yes, sir.

946
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,287
Mind yourself, Platt.

947
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,187
Joyous day.

948
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,973
Joyous day.

949
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,893
Dark times is behind us.

950
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,484
Clean living and prayer done lifted the plague!

951
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:19,735
As thick and white as New England snow.

952
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,073
Now, my niggers is returned to me.

953
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,084
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

954
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:39,509
Did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?

955
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,935
You won't stand idle, boy.

956
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,353
Not on my land.

957
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,900
Much work to do!

958
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:57,023
Days of old long since?

959
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,447
Joyous.

960
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,914
Joyous, indeed!

961
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,971
Let's go find something sweet for you.

962
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:16,628
Candy.

963
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,009
Candy?

964
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,422
<i>♪ Oh, pick this cotton ♪</i>

965
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:22,606
<i>♪ Pick this cotton ♪</i>

966
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,929
<i>♪ Oh, pick this cotton ♪</i>

01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,219

01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,137

977
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,530
George.

978
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,448
180 pounds.

979
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,208
Patsey.

980
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,790
520 pounds for Patsey.

981
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:55,752
That's my girl.
Don't ever let me down.

982
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,298
Platt?

983
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,710
160 pounds.

984
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,054
Armsby?

985
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,511
64 pounds.

986
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,313
A good day's labor would average 200 pounds.

987
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:13,849
Yes, sir.

988
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,239
I'm sure in time, you'll develop as a picker.

989
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,650
But it takes effort, boy.

990
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,321
Put some damn effort into it.

991
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,158
Yes, sir.

992
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,415
Take them out, get to whipping.

993
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,961
It's a tragedy.

994
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,835
How does such come to pass?

995
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,056
Working a field and picking
cotton like a lowly hand.

996
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,968
I'm of a damn sight better station.

997
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,104
I worked as an overseer, you know.

998
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:53,684
I did not know, sir.

999
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,349
Not "sir."

1000
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,859
Just "Armsby."

1001
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,900
I'm not owed more than any other in the field.

1002
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,032
How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask?

1003
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,035
Ask, it's just conversation.

1004
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:12,124
I became a little too dependent on the whiskey...

1005
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,751
a little too undependable on the job.

1006
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,793
Now, before you say
I'm just a sorry drunkard,

1007
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,083
let me state my case.

1008
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,128
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

1009
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,346
it is no easy chore on the spirit.

1010
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,016
I say, no man of conscious,

1011
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,644
can take the lash to another
human day in and day out...

1012
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:35,180
without shredding at his own self.

1013
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,354
Takes him to a place,

1014
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,022
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

1015
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,866
or he finds some way to trample
his guilty sensations.

1016
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,369
So, I trampled.

1017
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,450
With frequency.

1018
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,118
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity.

1019
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:03,877
But such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters.

1020
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,675
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.

1021
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:14,679
Now, all I want is to earn a
decent wage and get myself home.

1022
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,970
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.

1023
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:53,926
Just a few picayunes,
but all I have in the world.

1024
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,930
I promise them to you if you
will do me the favor I require.

1025
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:02,146
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

1026
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,104
What is it you ask?

1027
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,444
First, your word, sir.

1028
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,150
On my honor.

1029
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,279
It's a simple enough request.

1030
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,453
I only ask that you deposit a letter,

1031
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:22,962
at the post office in Marksville and that you
keep the action an inviolable secret forever.

1032
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,635
A patron is what I require, sir.

1033
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,017
I'll do it.

1034
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,558
And I'll accept whatever payment's offered.

1035
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,856
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

1036
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,486
I will do so...

1037
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,819
but fair compensation is all I ask.

1038
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,248
Draw up your letter.

1039
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,879
We'll meet again in two days?

1040
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,379
In two days.

1041
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,671
Thank you.

1042
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,088
Well, boy...

1043
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:37,097
I understand I got a learned
nigger that writes letters.

1044
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:41,268
Tries to get white fellas to mail them.

1045
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:52,938
Armsby told me today the devil was
among my niggers.

1046
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,576
That I had one that needed watching,

1047
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:00,078
or he would run away.

1048
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,907
When I asked him "why?"

1049
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:08,286
he said you come over to him,

1050
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,297
waked him up in the middle of the night,

1051
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,130
and wanted him to carry a letter...

1052
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,128
to Marksville.

1053
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,640
What do you got to say to that?

1054
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,228
There's no truth to it.

1055
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,643
You say.

1056
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,110
How could I write a letter without ink or paper?

1057
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,777
Who am I gonna write to?
I got no friends living as I know of.

1058
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,576
That Armsby...

1059
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:48,493
That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow.

1060
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,252
Didn't he want you to hire him as an overseer?

1061
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,751
Well, that's it.

1062
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,328
He wants to make you believe
we're all gonna run away...

1063
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,841
so you'll hire him as an overseer.

1064
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,728
He believes you're a soft soap.

1065
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:10,064
And he's given to such talk.

1066
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,690
Made this story out of whole cloth,

1067
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,572
because he wants a situation.

1068
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,409
It's all a lie, Master.

1069
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,870
It's all a lie.

1070
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,047
I'll be damned.

1071
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:51,848
Were he not free and white, Platt.

1072
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:56,269
Were he not free and white.

I just wanna say something about Uncle Abram.

1087
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,551
He was a good man...

1088
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:28,130
and he always looked out for
us ever since we were little.

1089
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,548
God love him.

1090
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,809
God bless him.
God keep him.

1091
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,263

1129
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:14,174
Hey, Bass.

1130
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,555
Oh, no, no, no.

1131
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:19,183
No shame in taking respite from the heat.

1132
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,060
Drink, shade.

1133
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,863
It's ungodly for travelers, hearty or otherwise.

1134
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:29,985
What's funny?

1135
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,865
Epps, I merely mean to finish
the work at hand, as requested.

1136
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,821
And as paid for.

1137
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,781
If something rubs you wrongly...

1138
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,867
I offer you the opportunity to speak on it.

1139
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:46,744
You ask plainly, so I will tell you plainly.

1140
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:51,757
What amused me just then was your concern
for my well-being in this heat,

1141
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,969
when, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers.

1142
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,395
"The condition of my laborers"?

1143
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,422
It is horrid.
It's all wrong.

1144
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:59,841
All wrong, Mr. Epps.

1145
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,260
They ain't hired help.

1146
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:03,473
They're my property.

1147
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:05,304
You say that with pride.

1148
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:07,144
I say it as fact.

1149
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,493
If this conversation concerns
what is factual and what is not,

1150
01:43:13,218 --> 01:43:17,984
then it must be said that there is no justice
nor righteousness in their slavery.

1151
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:20,946
But you do open up an interesting question.

1152
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,535
What right have you to your niggers,

1153
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,033
when you come down to the point?

1154
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:26,746
What right?

1155
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:30,212
I bought them.
I paid for them.

1156
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,331
Of course you did, and the law says

1157
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,254
you have the right to hold a nigger.

1158
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:36,385
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.

1159
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:41,219
Suppose they pass a law taking away
your liberty, making you a slave.

1160
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:42,508
Suppose.

1161
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:44,302
That ain't a supposable case.

1162
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:45,890
Laws change, Epps.

1163
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,147
Universal truths are constant.

1164
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:49,549
It is a fact...

1165
01:43:50,074 --> 01:43:54,528
a plain and simple fact that what is true
and right is true and right for all.

1166
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:56,689
White and black alike.

1167
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,158
You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

1168
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:03,161
I'm only asking, in the eyes of God,
what is the difference?

1169
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:09,327
You might as well ask what the difference
is between a white man and a baboon.

1170
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:13,335
I seen one of them critters in Orleans.

1171
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,875
Know just as much as any nigger I got.

1172
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,840
Listen, Epps.

1173
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,675
These niggers are human beings.

1174
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,197
If they are allowed to climb no
higher than brute animals.

1175
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:25,013
You and men like you will have to answer for it.

1176
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,183
There is an ill, Mr. Epps.

1177
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:30,723
A fearful ill resting upon this nation.

1178
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:34,352
And there will be a day of reckoning yet.

1179
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,611
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass...

1180
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,868
better than any man I know of.

1181
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:46,618
You'd argue that black was white,
or white, black...

1182
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:49,034
if anybody would contradict you.

1183
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:54,414
A fine supposition if you lived
among Yankees in New England.

1184
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,253
But you don't.

1185
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,883
You most assuredly do not.

1186
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,782
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

1187
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,581
Patsey!

1188
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,956
Pats!

1189
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:39,087
Where is she?

1190
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,256
Where's Pats?

1191
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,762
Where is she, damn it?

1192
01:45:46,614 --> 01:45:48,793
Where is she?
Where is Patsey? Where is she?

1193
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:50,156
What you standing there for?

1194
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:51,459
We know nothing of her, Master.

1195
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,892
Know nothing of what?
We know nothing of...

1196
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,133
Of what?
Where has she gone?

1197
01:45:55,158 --> 01:45:56,600
I don't know.
She run off, ain't she?

1198
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:57,768
I don't know, Master.

1199
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,482
Where is she?
I don't know, Master.

1200
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:02,615
You know, you know, you know!

1201
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:03,615
You know!

1202
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,447
No, I don't!

1203
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,659
You miserable black dogs.

1204
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:12,291
You stand like the deaf and dumb.

1205
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,453
Speak!

1206
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:32,307
She gone.

1207
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,648
My Pats is gone.

1208
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,500
Run off?
Run off, did you?

1209
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,659
Master Epps... You miserable wench.
Where you been?

1210
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,163
I been nowhere!

1211
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,422
Lies to your misdeeds!

1212
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:01,932
The Sabbath day, Master.
I took me

1213
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:03,309
a walk to commune with the Lord.

1214
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,768
Bring the Lord into your deceptions?

1215
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,270
You're coming from Shaw's plantation.

1216
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:07,592
No!
Master Epps.

1217
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,131
Now, you speak?

1218
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:11,346
Now that you want to add to her
lies, you find your tongue!

1219
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,819
I went to Master Shaw's plantation.

1220
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:15,346
Ah!
You admit it.

1221
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:16,976
Yes, freely.

1222
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,982
And you know why?

1223
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:21,690
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1224
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:26,191
Mistress Epps won't even grant
me no soap to clean with.

1225
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:30,369
I stink so much, I make myself gag!

1226
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:36,868
500 pounds of cotton.

1227
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,036
Day in, day out!

1228
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:41,046
More than any man here.

1229
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:43,299
And for that, I will be clean.

1230
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,175
That's all I ask.

1231
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:48,383
This, here, what I went to Shaw's for.

1232
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:50,885
Liar.

1233
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:54,643
The Lord knows that's all!

1234
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:55,724
You're a liar.

1235
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:59,311
And you, blind with your own covetousness!

1236
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:02,310
I don't lie, Master.

1237
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,064
If you kill me, I'll stick to that.

1238
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,407
I'll fetch you down.

1239
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,281
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1240
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:12,827
Treach.

1241
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:16,365
Run and fetch some line.

1242
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:17,704
Edward!

1243
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:22,330
Strip her.
Strike her bare and lash her to the post.

1244
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,908
You done this to yourself, Pats.

1245
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:55,783
Do it.

1246
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:03,087
Strike the life from her.

1247
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:10,715
Beat her.

1248
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,590
Give her the whip!
Give it all to her!

1249
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:18,853
Platt, you come here and you beat her now.

1250
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,397
Platt!

1251
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:26,436
Come here!

1252
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:30,360
I'd rather it you, Platt!

1253
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:33,067
You strike her.

1254
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:35,364
Strike her.

1255
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,267
He pantomimes.

1256
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:02,308
There's barely a welt on her.

1257
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:07,480
That's what your niggers make of you,
a fool for the taking.

1258
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,403
Strike her, Platt.
Strike her!

1259
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,547
You will strike her.

1260
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:36,263
You will strike her until her flesh is
rent and meat and blood flow equal

1261
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:39,220
or I will kill every nigger in my sight.

1262
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:40,885
You understand me?

1263
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:43,895
Strike her!
Strike her!

1264
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:29,938
Until I say no more.
I ain't said nothing!

1265
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,157
Give me the whip!

1266
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:43,371
Get up!

1267
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:04,472
Thou devil!

1268
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,559
Sooner or later...

1269
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:14,569
somewhere in the course of eternal justice,
thou shalt answer for this sin!

1270
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:23,032
Sin?
There is no sin.

1271
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:27,412
Man does how he pleases with his property.

1272
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:36,759
At the moment, Platt, I'm of great pleasure.

1273
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:40,675
You be goddamn careful I don't want to
come and lighten my mood no further.

1274
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,477
Master Bass.

1275
01:55:00,769 --> 01:55:03,943
I want to ask you what part
of the country you come from.

1276
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,025
No part of this land.

1277
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,158
I originate from Canada.

1278
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,701
Now, guess where that is.

1279
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:14,787
I know where Canada is.

1280
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,369
I've been there myself.

1281
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:24,133
Montreal...

1282
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:27,341
and Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.

1283
01:55:27,504 --> 01:55:29,347
Well-traveled for a slave.

1284
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:30,553
How came you here?

1285
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:34,307
Master Bass...

1286
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:40,017
if justice had been done,
I never would have been here.

1287
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:46,156
How's this?

1288
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,237
Tell me all.

1289
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:55,870
I'm afraid to tell you.

1290
01:55:57,534 --> 01:56:00,663
Every word you speak is a profound secret.

1291
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:09,884
Your story...

1292
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,015
it is amazing.

1293
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:14,176
And in no good way.

1294
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:22,560
Do you believe, sir, in justice, as you said?

1295
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:25,274
I do.

1296
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:29,237
That slavery is an evil that should befall none?

1297
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:33,866
I believe so.

1298
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:35,952
If you truly do...

1299
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,790
then I ask, I beg...

1300
01:56:43,455 --> 01:56:46,254
that you write my friends in the north...

1301
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:49,424
acquainting them of my situation...

1302
01:56:50,795 --> 01:56:55,096
and beseeching them to forward free papers.

1303
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:01,769
It would be...

1304
01:57:04,768 --> 01:57:07,612
an unspeakable happiness...

1305
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:11,279
to see my wife...

1306
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:16,075
and my family again.

1307
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:25,331
I traveled this country for the best part of 20 years...

1308
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,921
and my freedom is everything.

1309
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:33,430
The fact that I can walk out of here
tomorrow brings me great pleasure.

1310
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:38,302
My life doesn't mean much to anyone.

1311
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:43,311
It seems yours might mean
a lot to a whole lot of people.

1312
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:49,529
But what you ask of me, sir, scares me.

1313
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,534
And I must say, I am afraid.

1314
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,996
Not just for you, but for me.

1315
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:09,336
I will write your letter, sir.

1316
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:12,366
And if it brings you your freedom,
it will be more than a pleasure.

1317
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:14,345
It will have been my duty.

1318
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:17,508
Now, would you kindly hand me those shingles?

1319
02:00:52,078 --> 02:00:53,250
Platt!

1320
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:55,711
Where's the boy called Platt?

1321
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,379
Come here, boy.

1322
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,277
Your name is Platt, is it?

1323
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:27,367
Yes, sir.

1324
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:29,578
You know that man?

1325
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:48,976
Mr. Parker.

1326
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,138
Say again?

1327
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:55,024
Mr. Parker.

1328
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:58,149
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations.

1329
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:00,154
You look me in the eye...

1330
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:02,540
and on your life, you answer me truthfully.

1331
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:04,238
Have you any other name than Platt?

1332
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,402
Solomon Northup is my name.

1333
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,769
Sheriff, what's all this?

1334
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,281
It's official business.

1335
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:10,744
My nigger, my business.

1336
02:02:10,907 --> 02:02:12,534
Your business waits.

1337
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:13,792
Tell me of your family.

1338
02:02:14,118 --> 02:02:15,540
I have a wife, two children.

1339
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:16,579
What the hell?

1340
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,515
What are your children's names?
Margaret and Alonzo.

1341
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:19,891
What was your wife's name
before her marriage?

1342
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:21,418
Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.

1343
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:22,585
Where you going, Platt?

1344
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,381
Who authorized you
to interfere with my property?

1345
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:26,597
My authority.

1346
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:28,099
Platt, you come back here.
Platt!

1347
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,926
You come back here, boy.

1348
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:32,099
Boy.

1349
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:36,979
You unhand him.
Platt is my nigger!

1350
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:38,563
He is Mr. Solomon Northup.

1351
02:02:38,726 --> 02:02:39,602
You say.

1352
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:42,238
You come here, unfamiliar to me,
and make claims.

1353
02:02:42,397 --> 02:02:44,123
I got no doubts.
The man is Solomon Northup.

1354
02:02:44,148 --> 02:02:46,492
The hell he is!
He's my nigger, and I'll fight you for him!

1355
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:47,948
As is your right.

1356
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,312
As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you
in the courts.

1357
02:02:50,446 --> 02:02:52,790
Your decision.
Unhand him.

1358
02:02:53,573 --> 02:02:55,134
I know you had some hand in this, Platt.

1359
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:56,627
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

1360
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:57,912
Pay him no mind.

1361
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,456
I paid good money for this nigger.

1362
02:02:59,581 --> 02:03:00,958
Courthouse got papers to prove it!

1363
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:02,922
And we got papers proving he's free!

1364
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,802
I own you. You belong to me.
You hear me, Platt?

1365
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:06,087
Unhand him!

1366
02:03:06,254 --> 02:03:08,473
You'll have 200 stripes
across your back by sundown!

1367
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:09,757
Platt!

1368
02:03:09,966 --> 02:03:11,809
Get my horse, Treach.

1369
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:22,152
Get away from him, Pats.

1370
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:25,322
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.

1371
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,449
Solomon, we need to make haste.

1372
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,153
No.

1373
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:32,080
Solomon.

1374
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:11,175
I'll apologize...

1375
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:15,258
for my appearance.

1376
02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:19,767
But I have had...

1377
02:05:20,722 --> 02:05:22,690
a difficult time...

1378
02:05:23,683 --> 02:05:26,402
these past several years.

1379
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:32,617
Margaret.

1380
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:39,915
Alonzo.

1381
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,782
Who is this?

1382
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,818
He's my husband.

1383
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,492
Husband.

1384
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:22,667
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1385
02:06:24,452 --> 02:06:26,671
We have much acquainting to do.

1386
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,172
Yes, sir.

1387
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:33,465
And this is your grandson.

1388
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:37,469
Solomon Northup Staunton.

1389
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:49,276
Solomon.

1390
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:56,822
Anne...

1391
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:00,993
forgive me.

1392
02:07:04,534 --> 02:07:08,038
There is nothing to forgive.

1393
