1
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,915
Good morning, Daddy.

2
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,169
Hey, Ben, how you doing, man?

3
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,007
Oh, God.

4
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,052
Daddy's got to get ready for work.

5
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,887
Can't you stay home?

6
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,974
No. I got a real big day at work today.

7
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,310
Kim.

8
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,604
Where's my cell phone?

9
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,189
It's with my crayons.

10
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,817
It's not supposed to be with the crayons.

11
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,364
There you go, sweetie.

12
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,867
Okay, has anybody seen my beeper?

13
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,211
Here it is.

14
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,757
Right by the grape juice.
I wonder how it got there.

15
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,427
Are those my note cards
that I've been working all night on?

16
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,764
I've been up all night
and now they're all sticky.

17
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,767
- Sorry, baby.
- Yeah.

18
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,435
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

19
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,063
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

20
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,692
- Don't forget about the orientation today.
- The what?

21
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,153
Chapman Academy? The preschool?

22
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,907
Okay. Right.
Is there any way we could reschedule that?

23
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,577
Maybe we shouldn't.

24
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,830
Maybe we should take care of business
and be responsible parents.

25
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,207
Don't worry.

26
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,209
- Don't be late.
- I will not be late.

27
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,460
Promise?

28
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,671
I won't be late.

29
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,757
See you later.

30
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,511
- Did he promise?
- He sure did.

31
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,182
What's going on?

32
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,059
Your worst nightmare.

33
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,227
What?

34
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,396
Mr. Broccoli's a no-show.

35
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,399
He got a call-back
on a potato chip commercial.

36
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,944
- These snack foods are killing us!
- Yeah, I know.

37
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,570
Marvin!

38
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,738
Yeah?

39
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,825
The guy who smells the mail?

40
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,161
We need a guy to wear a broccoli suit,
not a normal guy.

41
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,496
Marvin, my man!

42
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,250
My friend, Marvin. What's going on today?
Listen, I need a favor.

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,169
We're having a focus group
and the broccoli guy left.

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,339
I was wondering if you'd put the suit on
and cover for us?

45
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,382
No.

46
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,554
I can't do the broccoli
because it's just not me. Sorry.

47
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,141
Can I be the carrot, though?

48
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,435
Yeah, you could be the carrot.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,061
- Let him try your carrot on.
- No.

50
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,480
- You'll be the broccoli.
- I don't want to be a bush.

51
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,192
It's not a bush, it's a stalk.
A strong stalk of broccoli.

52
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,737
- I'm pretty strong.
- You can make that work.

53
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,614
Let's switch this suit and get the broccoli.

54
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,324
Trust me on this. Let's go.

55
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,536
{y:i}B- R-O-C-C-O-L-I!

56
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,539
{y:i}I am the broccoli and don't know why!

57
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,417
{y:i}C- A-R-R-O and a T!

58
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,503
{y:i}Carrots are healthy for you and me!

59
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,475
{y:i}You want to do the dance?
{y:i}Go Broccoli, it's your birthday!

60
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,478
{y:i}- Go Carrot, go Carrot, go!
- No, I don't want to.

61
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,855
Hello, boys and girls!

62
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,192
Zowie! Do we have
a special treat for you today!

63
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,613
"Hey! We have a brand-new cereal!

64
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,907
"You're the first kid..."

65
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,575
Help!

66
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,745
It's super yummy.

67
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,914
- And loaded...
- Phil, help me.

68
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,708
...with all sorts of stuff that's good for you.

69
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,627
And do you know what we call it?

70
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,129
Veggie-Os!

71
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,967
This cereal sucks!

72
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,386
They're turning on us.

73
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,515
Give it a chance. Let it get in their mouth.
They got to taste it.

74
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,226
Take that!

75
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,106
Help me, Charlie!

76
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,775
Not in the face! Save yourself, Carrot!

77
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,736
Call security now. Stop that!

78
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,494
I guess we better go in, Pooch.
Your Daddy will come a little later.

79
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,496
Come here, let me see you.

80
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,506
I am so sorry, baby.

81
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,676
Things got crazy at work.
What's going on, man?

82
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,679
Look at this place.
It's Princeton for preschoolers.

83
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,306
Let's hurry up
so we won't be late for the orientation.

84
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,850
What's the orientation about?

85
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,894
It's a preschool,
they'll be playing with blocks, right?

86
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,654
Unbelievable.

87
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,616
Language skills are a critical component
here at Chapman.

88
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,744
They're part of our core curriculum.

89
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,287
You must be Charles.

90
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,748
- Call me Charlie. Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

91
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,207
- This is my wife, Kim.
- Hi.

92
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,294
Kimberly. I'm Miss Harridan,
the headmistress.

93
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,879
And this is Ben.

94
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,964
How do you do, Benjamin?

95
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,843
- Come on, little man.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

96
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,845
Shall we begin?

97
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,806
- Look at their outfits. I like that.
- They're cute.

98
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,144
We find uniforms reinforce
the sense of structure.

99
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,480
Structure's good.

100
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,442
Our philosophy is that
a child is like a climbing vine.

101
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,237
With structure to cling to,
and the right gardener to tend them...

102
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,156
they'll grow to the sky.

103
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,535
- Sorry.
- So, Mrs. Hinton...

104
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,829
you're returning to work?

105
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,540
Lawyer, I believe your file said.

106
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,293
Actually, I haven't practiced yet.

107
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,254
We just had Ben when I finished law school.

108
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,715
Still a little nervous about leaving him.

109
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,968
All mothers are. But you needn't worry.

110
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,263
Our little seedlings are in very good hands.

111
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,642
- Turn the darn phone off.
- It's off.

112
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,227
And attack!

113
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,479
Now mark your books, number five.

114
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,691
Cat is to mouse as frog is to...

115
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,901
Are they doing SAT prep?

116
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,070
It's never too early to start.

117
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,948
- Nest.
- That's right. Nest.

118
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,830
- I thought you turned your phone off.
- It's not my phone, it's my two-way.

119
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,875
This is bad.

120
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,129
Go ahead.

121
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,172
Okay. Thank you, baby.

122
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:30,176
I am terribly sorry.
I have an emergency at work. I gotta go.

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,262
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

124
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,930
Hey, little man.

125
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,017
Daddy's got to get going,
but I'll see you later on, okay?

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,518
You want to do the rocket ship?

127
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,437
Let's do the rocket ship.

128
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,241
Sorry about all the noise.

129
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,118
Here you go. Go to Mommy.

130
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,121
I'll see you later. Thank you for your time.

131
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,125
I'm so sorry.
He's trying out a new product at work.

132
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,880
No need to apologize.
Diligence always sets a fine example.

133
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,507
Jenny. Just in time.

134
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,510
Here's a copy of our curriculum...

135
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,347
and a list of your financial obligations.

136
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,599
This is the price per year?

137
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,933
Per month.

138
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,814
- Ben is starting preschool today.
- Where at?

139
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,399
Over at that Chapman Academy.

140
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,361
The Marine Corps of day care.
Max goes there.

141
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,280
Really? What do you think of that place?

142
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,533
There isn't much choice.
You got Harridan and her merry fembots...

143
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,204
or Idiot von Idiot and their School
for Children Who Like Accidents.

144
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,415
Numbers just came in
for Chocolatey Chocolate Balls.

145
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,833
Through the roof!

146
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,628
That's a surprise. You hear that?
Kids like chocolate.

147
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,837
Ice cream, too.

148
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,050
I forgot I was talking to the granola-heads
from the natural food division.

149
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,010
What was the stinker you got saddled with?

150
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,597
It's not a stinker.
It's Veggie-Os, the cereal of the future.

151
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,350
Right, Veggie-blows.
I thought they were killing that.

152
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,435
Jerry!

153
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,439
The numbers on the Chocolatey Chocolate
Balls are through the roof!

154
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,191
What does he mean, "killing that"?

155
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,986
Why you listening to Bruce?
Nothing's being killed. He's a clown.

156
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,197
If something was going down, we'd know.

157
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,824
We're killing it.

158
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,661
Come on, Jim. We had one bad test.
It's a hard nut to crack.

159
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,747
Any fool can sell
Chocolatey Chocolate Balls...

160
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,250
and cotton candy-flavored cereal to kids.

161
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,086
Cotton candy. That's not bad.

162
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,215
Guys, look. I'm sorry, but it was a dog.

163
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,802
Kids just don't want to eat vegetables
for breakfast. Who knew?

164
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,180
I told you that six months ago
when you put us on this project.

165
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,265
You did?

166
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,768
It's not just Veggie-Os.

167
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,521
We're shutting down
the whole health division.

168
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,023
That's like 300 people.

169
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,983
It's not a business we want to be in.

170
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,068
Where are we being reassigned?

171
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,826
Pooch, how was your first day at school?

172
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,745
Okay.

173
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,413
Just okay?

174
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,582
I don't know anybody there.

175
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,002
Give it some time. You'll make some friends.

176
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,463
How was your day, baby?

177
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,256
I lost my J-O-B.

178
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,550
You lost your J-O-B?

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,761
I got F-l-R-E-D.

180
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,637
Me and 300 other people.

181
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,181
They cannot do that!

182
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,268
- Can't Jim Fields do something?
- He's the one that pulled the trigger.

183
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,686
He's not gonna do anything.

184
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,397
When I found out it was him,
I told him to take a flying...

185
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,607
Charlie!

186
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,612
H-l-J-K-L-M-N-O-P.

187
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,907
Don't worry about this.

188
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,077
I'm in demand,
and I'll have a new job in a week.

189
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,044
What if we use the emergency fund?

190
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,173
We can't.
We already used it on the car payment.

191
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,637
There's no way around it.

192
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,264
We gotta pull Ben out of Chapman.
It's too much money.

193
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,433
What will we do for child-care?

194
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:09,938
- Are you gonna stay home with him?
- No, I'm not gonna stay home with him.

195
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,982
We just gotta find something
more affordable, that's all.

196
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,528
- This is the right address.
- You gotta be kidding me.

197
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,115
- We can at least check it out.
- Ben is not going here.

198
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,075
Looks can be deceiving. I'll go look.

199
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,161
Looks can be deceiving?
We're in a trailer park!

200
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,708
I'm looking for the preschool.

201
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,668
Yes, it is.

202
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,171
Welcome to the...

203
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,509
Sorry.

204
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,262
Welcome to the Touch of Eden Preschool.

205
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,348
- Can I help you?
- No, thank you.

206
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,980
- Is this the right address, here?
- I think so.

207
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,527
We keep the children right around here.

208
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,327
Go ahead. After you, ma'am.

209
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,495
Okay.

210
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,543
- Where'd you get this address?
- You picked this place.

211
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,211
We should report this to somebody.

212
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,717
That's what I'm talking about.

213
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,720
I knew there had to be
at least one decent place.

214
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,555
It looks all right.

215
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,684
{y:i}This is the police.

216
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,644
{y:i}We have you surrounded.

217
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,236
All right, Charlie. Give up the keys.

218
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,447
I don't know where the keys are.

219
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,199
Don't even try it.

220
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,828
- Why don't you drive the minivan?
- No. We talked about this last night.

221
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,956
You're staying home with Ben.
I'm driving the Mercedes.

222
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,128
You have me driving around town
in the dumb minivan all day.

223
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,838
Is the top down?

224
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,091
You know what, Kim?

225
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,928
Be careful. Don't just park it anyplace.

226
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,723
Be careful getting in and out of the car.
Don't get any dings in the door.

227
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:09,933
Come here.

228
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,436
Make sure you put good gas in there.
If you put in the cheap stuff...

229
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,147
the engine will start knocking,
and I don't want that.

230
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,275
You don't leave milk in the car
with the windows rolled up.

231
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,944
Always buckle up the car seat.

232
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,697
Don't park in the sun
or the seats will get too hot.

233
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,907
And no juice unless it's in a sippy cup.

234
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,325
Bye, baby.

235
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,329
Can you give a call,
tell us what time you'll be back?

236
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,041
Because we'll be here waiting,
just the two of us.

237
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,335
Bye, Mom.

238
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,796
Not too fast!

239
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,506
See you later.

240
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,761
When's Mommy coming back?

241
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,806
She'll be back around dinnertime, Mommy.

242
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,101
Is dinnertime soon?

243
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,272
No, but don't you worry.
We're going to have a lot of fun.

244
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,984
But we need Mommy to have fun.

245
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,615
Are you trying
to just break me down in the driveway?

246
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,493
- Why you want to break your father down?
- I'm sorry.

247
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,871
That's better. You broke me down smooth.

248
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,748
- My eyes welled up.
- I'm sorry.

249
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,666
- You made my eyes well up.
- Okay, let's...

250
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,127
- Look at my eyes.
- I see your eye twitching.

251
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,962
We're going to have fun!

252
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,024
Do you know how to change a diaper?

253
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,943
Yes, but I thought Max was potty-trained.

254
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,237
Believe me, so did I.

255
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,490
{y:i}Don't do that to me! What are you...

256
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,825
He's throwing things at me, and it smells.

257
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,577
{y:i}I really need your help!

258
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,791
- Are you potty-trained?
- Yes.

259
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,711
You got to go stinky?

260
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,754
Yes.

261
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,048
Then, go on. Go stinky, then.

262
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:14,182
You have a nauseous ache in your stomach
that you're a worthless failure?

263
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,727
We are worthless failures.

264
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,229
Hey, guys.

265
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,272
- Hey, Peggy. How you doing?
- Good.

266
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,982
What's going on, Nicky?

267
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,321
He can be a little hard
to understand sometimes.

268
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,324
Honey, go play. Have a good time, have fun.

269
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,618
Stay away from that cat poop.

270
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,955
- "Hija"? What'd he just say?
- God, I haven't a clue.

271
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,749
The doctor says it's just a phase, but...

272
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,918
It kept him out of Chapman.

273
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,211
Jerks.

274
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,340
Put that mouse down!

275
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,760
Give it to me!

276
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,263
What are you...

277
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,934
Charlie, I think it's great,
you guys being full-time dads.

278
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,270
We're real giants among men.

279
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,482
You are. You should be proud.
Most guys don't know who their kids are.

280
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,568
Joe still hasn't found anything?

281
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,570
No, and he's driving me crazy.

282
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,614
I should go back to work,
but what about Nicky?

283
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,116
Dead mouse.

284
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,452
There's no good alternative to Chapman.

285
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,595
If someone opened a decent day care
program here, they'd make a killing.

286
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,473
Nicky, what did I say about the cat poop?

287
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,457
What?

288
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,417
A day care center? You and me?

289
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:09,005
It's a completely underserved market.
Harridan has a monopoly on this suburb.

290
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,924
All we have to do is come in...

291
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,219
establish ourselves as the value alternative,
and we'll clean up!

292
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,097
- You think I'd be good at child-care?
- Absolutely.

293
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,516
Excuse me? Are these your kids?

294
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:21,851
No.

295
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,440
- Remember when you broke my yo-yo?
- I did not break your yo-yo.

296
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,859
- Yes, you did.
- I did not break your yo-yo.

297
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,403
Your yo-yo was broke.

298
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,031
You're killing me. You're really killing me.

299
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,415
I'm home!

300
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,138
- You said let's do this together.
- No, Daddy!

301
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,015
What's going on here?

302
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,606
A day care center. In our house?

303
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,693
Yes, Phil's apartment's only
a two-bedroom place.

304
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,237
This is crazy on 10 different levels.

305
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,406
What do you both know about
running a day care?

306
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,991
It's not rocket science.

307
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,910
We applied for a license.
It couldn't be any more simple.

308
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,039
- Daddy.
- What you want? The rocket ship?

309
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,544
- That's what you wanted, right?
- Milk.

310
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,339
You wanted milk? I'm sorry. He wanted milk.

311
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:37,093
Rocket man needs milk when he's flying.
It's for strong bones, in case you crash.

312
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,055
We understand each other.
What you think about this?

313
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:45,018
We're talking about other people's kids.
Do you understand that responsibility?

314
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,188
I'll be just as careful with them
as I am with Ben.

315
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:52,317
Don't be rubbing your head into stuff.
Watch where you're walking.

316
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,904
What about when you get a real job?
Just leave the parents hanging?

317
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,782
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

318
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,618
It won't be permanent.

319
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,080
We won't get rich from this,
but it might keep us out of bankruptcy.

320
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,624
- I don't know, Charlie.
- Come on, Kim.

321
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,460
I can't just sit around here.
I got to try to do something.

322
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,587
Come on. I need this.

323
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,676
I guess you better start
handing out those fliers.

324
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,927
All right.

325
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,304
- It makes much more sense...
- Me, too.

326
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,973
Okay, you want me to give you a hug?

327
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,309
Here's a big hug. Group hug.

328
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,695
Excuse me. When you get a chance...

329
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,593
Here you go, Daddy Day Care.

330
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,930
Hey, little karate guy.
Daddy Day Care, karate girl.

331
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,182
Hello! Daddy Day Care.

332
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,018
Hello, how are you?

333
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,486
Here you go. If you get a chance...

334
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,874
When you get a chance,
have a look at that. Thank you.

335
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,044
If it's not too much trouble,
when you get a chance...

336
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,181
"Warm, nurturing, experienced parents...

337
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:50,477
"providing exceptional child-care
at affordable prices."

338
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,856
The "experienced" part
is what I have to take issue with.

339
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,571
I give it three days.

340
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,575
You two guys are running
a day care center?

341
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,079
You're signing up people
at a lemonade stand on the front lawn?

342
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,083
Good luck with that. Come on, Paul.

343
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,087
Wait. Don't you believe in equality
amongst the sexes?

344
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,422
Can't men do everything women can do?

345
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,425
No, we can't. It's unnatural.

346
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,428
Little bit eeky.

347
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,930
You're guys?

348
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,015
What did you think Daddy Day Care meant?

349
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,685
I thought maybe one guy. Not only guys.

350
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,353
I just thought it was a clever name.

351
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,147
- Is this the day care place?
- They're all guys.

352
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,315
They're what?

353
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:41,361
Excuse me. Listen.
We are two loving, caring parents.

354
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,862
We run a day care center.

355
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,906
You're a couple of sickos!

356
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,367
How about a free trial offer?

357
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:48,910
Sickos!

358
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,622
- Oh, dear.
- Come on!

359
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,668
Hi, Peggy! Hi, Nicky. How you doing?

360
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,170
Nicky is so excited for his big day.

361
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,007
- How old are you? Oh, yeah, five.
- I got it.

362
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,968
Wait. You're leaving Nicky here
with these guys?

363
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,847
You have trouble with them being guys?
Are you from the Dark Ages?

364
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,349
Aren't you for gender equality
and all that jazz?

365
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,852
Peggy, come on. Of course we are.

366
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,688
So can't women do what men do
and men do what women do?

367
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,440
These guys can do the job.

368
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,152
- You'll vouch for these two?
- Yeah, I'll vouch for them.

369
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,989
- I'll try it.
- You're doing it?

370
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,949
They'll have a great time.

371
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,159
- Okay.
- Right, kids?

372
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,910
You're a real lifesaver.

373
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,497
You screw this up,
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

374
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,960
- Here, now, go to Phil.
- No, I don't want to go.

375
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,087
- Come on. Let go.
- I don't want to go!

376
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,090
He's got a little bit of separation anxiety.

377
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,552
- Dylan!
- I don't want to go!

378
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,015
- I just stopped breastfeeding.
- I'd freak out, too.

379
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,517
- Lf you could grab a leg.
- I don't want to go.

380
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,186
- All right.
- Here we go.

381
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,563
- Here we go.
- Come on, Dylan.

382
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,024
- All right, sweetie.
- I don't want to go.

383
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,487
Come on. Let go of Mom!

384
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,908
Thank you. Oh, man.

385
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,912
- No lactose, no peanuts, no shellfish.
- Nothing high in fructose.

386
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,624
- Or sucrose or dextrose.
- Or maltodextrose.

387
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,044
- Nothing with red dye number six.
- Or number four.

388
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,005
Or yellow dye number two.

389
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,342
Will you say "maltodextrose" for me again?
So cute.

390
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,260
Maltodextrose.

391
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,474
- Or yellow dye number two.
- Two, right.

392
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,975
His name's Crispin.

393
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,435
My man, Crispin!

394
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,229
How's it going, big guy?

395
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,651
What time's pickup?

396
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,236
At 5:00.

397
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,197
I have laser treatment. Make it 6:00.

398
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,700
Sorry about the outfit. He won't take it off.

399
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,493
How long has he been wearing that?

400
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,911
Couple of weeks.

401
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,248
Who will you call if there are any problems?

402
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,708
911, Mommy.

403
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,918
That's such a good girl.

404
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,047
Come on. I'll let you hold my keys.

405
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,550
How about a Life Saver?
You like Life Savers?

406
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,052
How about money? A dollar?

407
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,182
A dollar.

408
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:19,894
You are a smart man. That is yours.
All right.

409
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,314
Welcome to Daddy Day Care.

410
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,943
We're your team facilitators.
My name is Charlie and this is Phil.

411
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,988
Anybody ever seen
a mission statement before?

412
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,908
Here. Everybody take one.
Take a mission statement.

413
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,494
Here we go. One for everybody. Slow down.

414
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,288
All right. Okay.

415
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:42,000
Who wants to be first one
to read the first sentence...

416
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,085
on the mission statement?

417
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,504
Okay, how about you?

418
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,298
I don't read yet.

419
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,467
I'm looking for someone who can read.

420
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,471
By a show of hands,
how many of you can already read?

421
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,934
Raise your hand
if you don't know how to read.

422
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,521
Here's what we'll do.

423
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,857
I'll read the mission statement aloud...

424
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,986
and what I want you guys to do
is just follow along as I read it.

425
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,865
Doesn't that sound like interesting fun?
Here we go.

426
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:18,328
"As the members and facilitators
of the Daddy Day Care team...

427
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,414
"we will collectively strive to provide..."

428
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:25,585
Sean, don't eat the mission statement.
Get that out of your mouth.

429
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,712
"...will collectively strive to..."

430
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:32,300
Don't rip the mission statement, Little Flash.
It's an important document.

431
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,179
Come back here!

432
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,225
What he's really trying to say is...

433
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,609
Stop running!

434
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,736
Come here.

435
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,865
You want the rocket ship?

436
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,036
- One more?
- Rocket ship!

437
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:04,374
Everybody'll get the rocket ship.
Slow down, everybody.

438
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:10,046
- I thought you said this would be easy.
- You know what I'm thinking now?

439
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,090
This was a huge mistake.

440
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:16,636
I never quit anything in life,
but I'm not sure if I can take this.

441
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,556
- I'll be right back.
- Where you going?

442
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,267
- Help me do the rocket ship.
- Trust me.

443
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:32,068
Four absent children. No explanation.

444
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,070
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

445
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:38,324
In a group this size,
three absent children is a coincidence.

446
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,785
Four is a statistical anomaly.

447
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:44,873
Hello, Santa Luma!

448
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:45,915
Hello, Santa Luma!

449
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,670
Everybody! It's Big Phil with a guitar!

450
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:54,299
Why don't you guys enjoy Big Phil
while I rest my spine?

451
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,968
Max, bring your dad a chair.

452
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,097
They really like that rocket ship.

453
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,266
{y:i}When I was a small boy

454
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,519
{y:i}at the age of five

455
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,439
{y:i}my mama said

456
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,318
{y:i}I'd be the greatest man alive

457
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,612
{y:i}I'm a man

458
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,616
{y:i}I'm a full-grown man

459
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,744
{y:i}I'm a fat man

460
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,582
Hey, come on into the kitchen.

461
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,960
{y:i}Put the lime in the coconut
{y:i}and drink 'em all up

462
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:34,297
{y:i}Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em all up

463
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,634
{y:i}Put the lime in the coconut
{y:i}you drink 'em all up

464
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,638
{y:i}I say, "Doctor,
{y:i}ain't there nothing I can take?"

465
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,599
{y:i}I say, "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache?"

466
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,434
{y:i}I say, "Doctor..."

467
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:49,437
{y:i}Like a rhinestone cowboy

468
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,358
{y:i}Riding out on a horse

469
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,695
{y:i}in a star-spangled rodeo

470
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:01,408
{y:i}Hava nagila, hava nagila

471
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,326
{y:i}Hava nagila

472
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,748
I am definitely out of songs.

473
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,792
Lunchtime.

474
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,719
I don't know
if we should be feeding them this stuff.

475
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,013
Why not? Look at them. They love it.

476
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,394
Yeah, but I'm a little worried.

477
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,854
About what?

478
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,069
911.

479
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,447
He tore off his head!

480
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,950
Crispin stole my doll. I need help.

481
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:48,788
Come on!

482
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,125
You know how old this piano is?
Keep your feet off the piano.

483
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,211
Get your shoes off the couch.
Get them off the couch!

484
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,216
Crispin. Please!

485
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,719
Give me the...

486
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,930
{y:i}The meat ain't the only fresh thing
{y:i}around here.

487
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,183
Don't play with that. Give me this.

488
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,565
Leave it alone, okay?

489
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,917
All right.

490
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,711
You get off those drapes.

491
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,256
Stop climbing the drapes. You stop it.

492
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,883
You come here!

493
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,096
Give me the vase!

494
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,847
Put down the vase!

495
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,439
Tomorrow, we give them all organic.

496
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,109
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

497
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,194
How can you say that? Look at this.

498
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,862
What goes up...

499
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,593
You guys are good.

500
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,847
What do you expect?
You left your kids with professionals.

501
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,060
Sorry to leave you hanging.

502
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,855
Since we got laid off,
Sheila's made me make dinner.

503
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,648
Really? How's that going?

504
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,109
It ain't napping.

505
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,154
- Can I take these snack cakes home?
- Go ahead.

506
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,742
How you doing, little man?

507
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,161
That's how you doing?

508
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,413
Excuse me a second.

509
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,877
Give me that. That's too loud.

510
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,712
Let go, it's too loud.

511
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,547
I'm serious. Let go.

512
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:08,762
It's late. Where's your mom?

513
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,180
Shut up, butthead.

514
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:12,974
Shut... You stop that.
You know something?

515
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,561
Your mommy and daddy
would not like you talking like that.

516
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,897
When your mommy comes,
I'll tell her that you...

517
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,523
Let's go. Motor's running.

518
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:24,194
- Get out of here. Hey, I wish you would.
- Stop, Crispin!

519
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,529
- Don't make that face.
- What?

520
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,199
Don't make lines. Quiet the face.

521
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,910
Relax the face. Quiet the face.

522
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,913
Yes, calm your face.
Show no lines, you know.

523
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:37,874
You got early drop-off?

524
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:40,168
No, we don't have anything...

525
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,504
I'm going to see you tomorrow.

526
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,881
I'll see you tomorrow, Crispin.

527
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,634
You'll be just like your father.

528
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:51,179
Look at him.
Hanging off of him, his skin. Hanging off.

529
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:54,766
- Hey, little man.
- Hey, Dad.

530
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,976
What are you up to?

531
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,023
Just trying to read a story.

532
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,609
Listen, man...

533
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:08,530
I know I was really busy today
taking care of those other kids.

534
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:11,991
I know it probably wasn't easy for you
sharing your toys...

535
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:15,620
and watching Daddy
do rocket ship with everybody, but...

536
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:18,456
Now it's just us,
we can do whatever you want to do.

537
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,460
- Can we read this story?
- We sure can read this story.

538
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:23,920
All right.

539
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,923
"There once was a herd of elephants.

540
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,469
"Elephants young, elephants old,
elephants tall and short, fat and thin.

541
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,850
"All were different, but all were happy,
and almost all were the same color.

542
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:40,186
"And they all made the elephant sound."
They all said...

543
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,482
Let me hear you make that sound.

544
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,069
Do it again?

545
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:51,990
No, I can't do it again,
because Daddy might have an aneurysm.

546
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,707
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

547
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:09,174
I'm not cleaning this up.

548
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:31,321
Hey, take this in there. Go sit down.

549
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,076
Maybe I haven't had my coffee yet,
but it seems like these kids are multiplying.

550
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,828
- Yeah, we got two new kids.
- Oh, come on!

551
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:42,332
We'll have to up our game.
We need structure and planned activities.

552
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,335
No, we need Ritalin and leashes,
that's what we need.

553
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:47,087
All we'll need is this.

554
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,007
Everybody, let's do this.

555
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,967
Everybody, come in here.

556
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,679
Okay, let's try another play. Let's try this.

557
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,639
Let's try this. Here's what we'll do.

558
00:34:57,722 --> 00:35:00,266
This new play's called the Baby Blitz.

559
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,686
I want you to hang back and do a lateral.

560
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:05,397
I want you to go down the middle
for a buttonhook.

561
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,315
I want you to be my blocker.

562
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,110
How about we just run in a circle?

563
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:13,988
We can do that. That's an even better play.
Everybody run in a circle.

564
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,992
Yes? All right, let's run in a circle.
Come on, run in a circle.

565
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:21,204
Tony, you'll see the ball a lot better
if you take your mask off.

566
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,289
I'm not Tony, I'm Flash.

567
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:37,220
How come you're not playing, little man?

568
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,598
Come on, it's football. You love football.

569
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:41,975
Help!

570
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:44,561
Help! Stuck!

571
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,900
I live in California.

572
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,194
- Where do you live?
{y:i}- I am in Hong Kong.

573
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,030
Where's Hong Kong?

574
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:00,577
- Can you hear me now?
{y:i}- I can't hear you.

575
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,289
Can you hear me now?

576
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,832
What is it?

577
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,753
I thought you liked football.
You're telling me you don't like...

578
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,763
I'll be right back, little man. I got to go...

579
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,312
You got a little problem over there with Max.

580
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,773
- It's happening.
- What's happening? What is it?

581
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:33,401
Lt! It's happening.
He hasn't gone for a week. That's it.

582
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:36,654
Oh, no. That's... It's happening?

583
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,032
It's happening. I know the face. Look.

584
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,913
- You got to go and deal with that.
- I can't.

585
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,873
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I can't.

586
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,167
- Come on, you have to do it.
- I can't.

587
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,044
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

588
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,504
- Yes, you can.
- All right, I will!

589
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:53,630
Good. Come on.

590
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:15,985
I can't.

591
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,988
Listen. I see you got issues about this...

592
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,491
so I'll take care of it this time, all right?

593
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,495
- In the future, you got to work it out.
- I got to work it out.

594
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:28,998
That's your son. God willing,
when you get older, he'll do this for you.

595
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,376
So you want to know he owes that to you.

596
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,461
- He owes me.
- He owes you.

597
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,634
- Don't get cute with the thing.
- I'm not assuming you're doing it.

598
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:43,304
- So how you want to do this?
- I can do this myself.

599
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,806
- You sure?
- Yes.

600
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:49,144
Okay, well, you go and do it
with your bad self. You go and do it now.

601
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,230
All right. You need anything,
I'm right out here.

602
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,995
Hey, big guy, how'd it go in there?

603
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,538
I missed.

604
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,873
What does that mean?

605
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,207
I missed.

606
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,585
Oh, hell, no.

607
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,123
- Come on!
- No.

608
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,920
Come on. Put this down.
You don't play with this.

609
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,214
And you ripped up my wife's flowers.

610
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,967
Give me this. You're not supposed to.
Go play with something else.

611
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,929
- What's going on here?
- It's spiraling out of control.

612
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,682
Don't panic. They're like animals.
They can smell fear.

613
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,850
I don't know what to do.
I've run out of ideas.

614
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,769
I'll tell you what...

615
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,651
Quietly, children. Follow me.

616
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:21,736
Six absences.

617
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,948
Single file.

618
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,951
I have to go make a phone call.

619
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,163
Let's get ready...

620
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,916
to rumble!

621
00:39:36,918 --> 00:39:39,462
Let me tell you something,
I have never liked carrots.

622
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,298
And today as I stand here
and look at you before me...

623
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,635
having the audacity to think
that you can defeat me...

624
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,140
let me tell you something, brother,
I am about to kick your carrot butt!

625
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,600
Let me tell you something, Mr. Broccoli.

626
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:57,022
When The Carrot is done with you,
you will be nothing but a kumquat!

627
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,483
I will destroy everything in this world
that is broccoli.

628
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,111
The carrot is the lowest form of vegetable!

629
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:05,488
What about me?

630
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,823
Nobody likes broccoli.

631
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:10,118
Really? Well, Ben likes broccoli, don't you?

632
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,162
No.

633
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,791
You turned my own sprout against me?
Now you're gonna die!

634
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,978
Okay, come on. I felt that.

635
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:38,355
Come on.

636
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,027
Will you stop it?

637
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,364
That's it.

638
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,162
- What's that about?
- I'm sorry.

639
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,373
- You made me crazy!
- You little maniac!

640
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,875
You're wrecking my wife's tables.

641
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,086
Somebody's at the door.

642
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,420
My back.

643
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:11,596
Is this the Hinton residence?

644
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,641
I'm Dan Kubitz, Child Services.

645
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:17,852
I'm here to conduct
a compliance inspection.

646
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,146
No one said anything about any inspection.

647
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,315
We only do it if we receive a complaint.

648
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,651
A complaint?
Somebody complained about...

649
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:27,737
Come on in. You can inspect us.
We have nothing to hide.

650
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:30,782
You caught us at a crazy time.
We're playing with the kids.

651
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,076
Somebody complained about us?

652
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,497
So, where is the nap area?

653
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:40,250
- The nap area?
- Right.

654
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,085
We don't have a nap area.

655
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,130
We just let them fall asleep
wherever they drop.

656
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:49,092
"Sleep where they drop."
Well, I think that should just about do it.

657
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:50,969
What's the bottom line?

658
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:55,390
Well, you need to correct
the deficiencies on this form.

659
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:57,934
And also...

660
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:01,855
you need to fill out
these compliance certification documents.

661
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:04,232
Who wants these, the carrot or the broccoli?

662
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:05,608
Carrot.

663
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:08,236
There's a lot of stuff on here.

664
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:09,904
So we can stay open, right?

665
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:12,532
As long you've done that by 9:00 a.m.
Tomorrow morning.

666
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:13,867
9:00 a.m.

667
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:17,454
Good luck with this.
I like what you're doing.

668
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:19,372
I'd hate to be the guy to shut you down.

669
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,541
We'd hate for you to be that guy.

670
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:23,752
I will be. Don't want to be.

671
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:27,630
Okay. Safety gates
at the bottom of the stairs...

672
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:30,633
top of the stairs, bedrooms, bathrooms.

673
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:32,844
I've gone safety gate crazy.

674
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,347
How many kids have we got?

675
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,682
I've lost track, they run so fast.

676
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,518
You can get started on this batch over here.

677
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:44,564
- It's getting late. Let's just call it a night.
- We can't call it a night.

678
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:46,775
We got a bunch of kids coming
in five hours.

679
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:49,903
I'm serious. We know nothing
about running a day care center.

680
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:52,405
We don't know anything.
We're not even good parents!

681
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,157
I'm a good parent.

682
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,285
- What does that mean?
- What?

683
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,371
That thing. What is that?

684
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:04,376
You know that rocket ship thing you do?
Ben doesn't even like that.

685
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:07,504
That just happens to be Ben's favorite thing.

686
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:12,425
He lets you do it because you like it.
It's the one time you pay him attention.

687
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:15,303
- You don't change your kid's diapers.
- I don't like diapers.

688
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:18,181
You should teach your kid
how to go to the toilet and aim...

689
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,725
so we don't have to redecorate the place
when he goes.

690
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:22,018
You're right.

691
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,186
Let me tell you something.

692
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,730
My kid is 4 years old,
and for the first time today...

693
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:29,025
I saw him playing with the other kids,
just being a normal kid.

694
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,528
It felt great knowing
I had something to do with it.

695
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:32,654
We did that!

696
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:36,574
If we can do that, we can definitely
get this place up to code by dawn.

697
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:39,828
Let's go safety gate crazy.

698
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:42,122
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

699
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,707
It's all right.

700
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,755
- All I got is $5.
- I can break that.

701
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:56,052
Listen, I left the paperwork
on the kitchen table. It's not there.

702
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:57,679
Please tell me you have it.

703
00:43:57,762 --> 00:43:59,055
I don't have it.

704
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:11,067
- Hey, guys.
- Marvin, what are you doing here?

705
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:14,612
The door was unlocked.
I got your final paychecks here.

706
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,114
Thanks.

707
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:18,908
So, what's going on here?

708
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:23,204
Don't even ask.

709
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,262
You can understand him?

710
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,264
Yeah, he's speaking Klingon.

711
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:44,059
That's Klingon.
I thought the kid was an idiot.

712
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,770
God, how much "Star Trek"
does that kid watch?

713
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:49,981
- Too much.
- The guy from Child Services is here.

714
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:53,360
- Sorry.
- No, listen. Why don't you do me a favor?

715
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:56,154
Why don't you take the kids in the back
and play with them?

716
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:59,199
Keep their attention for a while,
while I talk to this guy.

717
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:03,411
Whatever you do, don't let this big bruiser
get near the lawnmower. Thanks.

718
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:07,540
- Mr. Kubitz. Hi.
- I thought I was early, but...

719
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:10,919
- I was just getting the paperwork.
- Great.

720
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:14,089
- You dropped something.
- Yeah.

721
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,635
- The kids wanted to help out.
- That's sweet.

722
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:20,804
So here's everything for you.

723
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:24,474
What I'll need is your signature
on the back of her head.

724
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,352
And on the elbow of this kid.

725
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:29,938
- Do you have a pen?
- I do have a pen.

726
00:45:30,897 --> 00:45:33,316
- This is my lucky pen.
- Thank you.

727
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:36,861
- And where's on the...
- Initial the elbow.

728
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,115
- Sign the back of her head.
- On her neck?

729
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:43,660
- Great. That should just about do it.
- Here we go.

730
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:47,038
- You're ready to roll.
- Let's go in and get started.

731
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:51,710
Well, you know,
everything looks okay here...

732
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,879
but it says here
that you now have 11 children.

733
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,756
That's correct.

734
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,135
So I assume that you've hired
a third care provider.

735
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:02,846
Why would you just assume that?

736
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:07,100
Well, section 768 of the Child Welfare Code
specifically states...

737
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:11,312
that the ratio of children to care providers
cannot exceed 5:1.

738
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,732
- The 768.04.
- 768.04.

739
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:17,527
The ratio thingy.
We resolved that this morning.

740
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,737
- Good.
- Yes.

741
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,573
We hired someone. We hired Marvin.

742
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:28,621
- Marvin was hired! He's with the kids.
- He's an excellent child-care worker.

743
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:31,666
I'd love to take a look,
if that's okay with you.

744
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,545
- You want to go out there?
- It'll be good for me to see for myself.

745
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:37,797
Let's go and have a look at Marvin.

746
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:46,348
Now, put your hands up. Now, wave them.

747
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:52,312
He certainly seems like
he knows what he's doing.

748
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,563
Of course.

749
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:57,150
- I've got to say that.
- Yeah, we interviewed a lot of people.

750
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:00,904
Yeah, it was a really long, grueling
singling-out process.

751
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:08,411
And now, I'm a chicken.

752
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:11,373
I'm a bird. Look, I'm a bird.

753
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:15,460
You can never be too careful
when it comes to kids.

754
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:20,048
And here at Daddy Day Care we'll only work
with the best, so we got Marvin.

755
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:23,927
Sorry.

756
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:28,973
- What did you do to these kids?
- What?

757
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:32,519
- Are they on drugs?
- Well, there's this one kid, maybe.

758
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:34,938
How'd you get them to behave like this?

759
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,066
- Got to know how to handle them.
- How do you know that?

760
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:41,069
I read
"Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care" book.

761
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:44,739
It's not about "Star Trek".

762
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,743
- Finish.
- Yeah.

763
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:55,041
You know, when I was in the back...

764
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,545
I spotted, under the eaves of the porch...

765
00:47:58,628 --> 00:48:00,505
what looked like a beehive.

766
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:03,425
- A big one.
- Don't worry. All taken care of.

767
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:05,885
- I don't want anybody getting hurt.
- No hurt. Gone.

768
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:09,639
- You really have turned this around.
- Thank you very much.

769
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:11,975
- I'm impressed. I really am.
- Thank you.

770
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,560
For our own curiosity...

771
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:16,980
any chance you could
tell us where the complaint came from?

772
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:21,651
I really would love to,
but I have a relationship with the state.

773
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:25,071
- Just for our own curiosity.
- That was Miss Harridan.

774
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:28,283
- I'm sure she'll see us.
- We need to talk to you.

775
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:32,412
- Sorry. They just barged right in.
- That's quite all right, Jenny.

776
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:34,622
Gentlemen, please sit down.

777
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,503
Now, what can I do for you?

778
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:45,300
We wanted to thank you for helping
to expedite our accreditation process.

779
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:48,595
Thanks to your tip, somebody
from child services came to see us.

780
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:52,140
I had heard you opened
some sort of day care program...

781
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:54,351
and I was concerned.

782
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:57,187
That's nice of you.
You don't have to be concerned about us.

783
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:01,191
It's not you I'm concerned about.
It's the children you're looking after.

784
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:05,445
- Wait a minute. We're parents. That's a start.
- Any boob can be a parent.

785
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:08,198
If you want to screw up your own child,
that's your right.

786
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:12,410
But when it comes to other people's kids,
there's a higher standard to answer to.

787
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:16,706
Mr. Kubitz seems to think that we met
that standard. Show her the thing.

788
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,501
That piece of paper doesn't impress me.

789
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,170
We're getting it laminated.

790
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:26,424
You two are just some fly-by-night
operation looking to make a fast buck.

791
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:29,177
You're just afraid of the competition.
Let's go.

792
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,888
Competition? Don't flatter yourselves.

793
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:36,393
Daddy Day Care will never be
in the same league as this institution.

794
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:38,853
Laminated!

795
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,691
That wasn't as satisfying as I thought.

796
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:46,528
I think we can take her. All we need
is some garlic and a wooden stake.

797
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:48,947
You know what she said that was right?

798
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,367
These kids need more than watching.
Tomorrow we'll take it up a notch.

799
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,744
We got to start stimulating their minds.

800
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:00,083
- But I'm not a daddy.
- You don't have to be a daddy.

801
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,753
You're a male-type humanoid.
That fits in with the philosophy of the place.

802
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:07,257
I don't know, guys. I mean,
I guess I like hanging out with the kids.

803
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,591
It's kind of cool.

804
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:12,012
But I guess child-care wasn't necessarily...

805
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,223
an avenue that I felt professionally
I was headed towards.

806
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,851
- That's exactly what I said.
- Excuse me.

807
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,269
Yes, come on in!

808
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,648
- How are you?
- Hey, guys.

809
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:26,776
I am so sorry.
I forgot to write you a check this week.

810
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,030
Ever since the divorce,
my head's just been like...

811
00:50:35,326 --> 00:50:38,038
- Are you the new daddy?
- I'm your daddy.

812
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,792
I'm not your daddy.

813
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:46,171
Well, I'm your baby's daddy. I'm not...

814
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:50,216
I'm not your baby's daddy.
I'm going to be...

815
00:50:53,011 --> 00:50:54,471
You're Marvin.

816
00:50:57,974 --> 00:51:01,853
Well, it's nice to meet you, Marvin. I'm Kelli.

817
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:04,105
Dylan's mom.

818
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:11,237
- I got to run.
- Thank you.

819
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:13,573
- All right. Bye, guys.
- Have a good one.

820
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,492
- Thanks.
- Bye.

821
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,994
I'm in. Do you have a dental plan?

822
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:20,163
All right.

823
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:23,833
Your first assignment is to show us
how you handle kids the way you do.

824
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:24,959
Teach us.

825
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:27,587
If this were a business,
and they were customers...

826
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,214
how do you find out what they want?

827
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,384
- I'd put together a focus group.
- All right, let's do it.

828
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:32,509
We'd like you to tell us what you'd like
to get out of Daddy Day Care.

829
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:36,137
We'd like you to tell us what you'd like
to get out of Daddy Day Care.

830
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,973
Help us to help you.

831
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,142
Who'd like to start?

832
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,605
We need more learning about things.

833
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:48,733
- More learning about things?
- Yes.

834
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,528
We're at a very critical age.

835
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:56,241
- You have to feed our minds.
- All right. You want to write that down?

836
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:59,160
"Feed our minds."

837
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:02,205
Great. Okay, what else?

838
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:06,292
Dolphins. Dolphins are good.

839
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,878
- Dolphins are fish.
- No, they're not.

840
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,090
- They live in water.
- That doesn't mean they're fish.

841
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:16,636
Calm down and talk about something else.
What else would you like to talk about?

842
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,722
Where do babies come from?

843
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:23,059
Let's go back to the dolphin subject
and discuss dolphins...

844
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:26,312
or if there's anything else
on someone's mind we can talk about...

845
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:29,107
- other than that.
- Write that down.

846
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:32,402
- Okay, what else?
- Could we...

847
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:36,072
What were you going to say, Ben?

848
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:39,743
I can see you were going to say something.
What is it, son?

849
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:41,077
More...

850
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:45,081
- drawing?
- More drawings?

851
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:49,377
Yeah! Like pictures and stuff. It's really fun.

852
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:55,258
- Okay, yeah, great. More drawings.
- Yeah!

853
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,595
- More chasing bad guys.
- Excellent idea.

854
00:52:58,636 --> 00:53:00,096
We can chase Joker.

855
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,807
Well, wait a second, buddy.
That's Batman's bad guy.

856
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:05,769
You're Flash,
so you want to be chasing...

857
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,022
- Lex Luthor?
- No. That's Superman.

858
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:13,526
You want to be chasing Captain Boomerang,
Gorilla Grodd, Reverse Flash.

859
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,986
The Riddler?

860
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,989
What have you been doing to these kids?

861
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:25,283
Starting tomorrow, Phil will be hosting
a Three Stooges film festival in the TV room.

862
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,744
I know everybody's looking forward
to that, right?

863
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:28,828
Thanks, Daddy!

864
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:32,374
Last but not least, the Thumb Suckers
Support Group will have a meeting...

865
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,417
under the tree after nap time...

866
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,753
which starts right after
you finish your snack.

867
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:40,757
So after you finish, grab a blanket,
get a spot, and we have that.

868
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,593
Also, next week is going
to be Alpha Girls Group.

869
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:46,596
And we're going to have
Tai Chi under the tree.

870
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,974
And we're going to also have pet day,
so you bring your pets in.

871
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:51,518
We'll have pet show-and-tell.

872
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:56,064
This is my bunny. His name is Tiny.

873
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:59,901
I feed him a lot. Five times a day.

874
00:55:59,984 --> 00:56:03,238
He poops a lot, too. Six times a day.

875
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,281
It's like little marbles.

876
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,742
This is my turtle, Sparks.

877
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:12,038
He's fast. He's the fastest turtle in the world.

878
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:18,586
Go! Go, Sparks!

879
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:26,469
This is my parrot, Paulie.
I'm teaching him to talk. Talk.

880
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,221
Shut up, butthead.

881
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:37,439
Okay, Becca, where's your pet?

882
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:40,608
I had a tarantula,
but I don't know where he is.

883
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:44,612
Okay, all right, don't panic.

884
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,615
What do you mean, don't panic?
There's a big spider in here.

885
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,409
I got a spider on my head!

886
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,083
- So what are we betting on today?
- I'm going to do a diaper stroke, okay?

887
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,501
All right.

888
00:56:58,668 --> 00:57:02,630
Well, if it isn't the geniuses
that brought the world Veggie-Os.

889
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:08,011
- So, how's unemployment?
- Actually, I've got the best job I've ever had.

890
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:09,888
Yeah, it's a start-up.

891
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:14,309
We offer time-management facilitation
to mostly working professionals.

892
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:17,062
That's a tough market.
Sounds pretty cutthroat.

893
00:57:17,145 --> 00:57:20,482
- Yeah. It's a real blood sport.
- What's the money like?

894
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:22,859
Bruce! Let's go, I got Botox.

895
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,695
Hi, Charlie. Hi, Phil.

896
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:28,531
- Hey, Crispin.
- What's up, little man?

897
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:29,824
How do you know my kid?

898
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:33,036
They're his day care teachers,
what do you think?

899
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,581
Day care? That's what it is?

900
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:40,335
Oh, my God.
You're wiping boogers for a living.

901
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,589
Losers.

902
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,260
You're paying us to do it, too, you know.

903
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,721
Losers.

904
00:57:53,723 --> 00:57:55,767
"Do you like green eggs and ham?

905
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:02,732
"I do not like them, Sam-l-Am.
I do not like green eggs and ham.

906
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:05,860
"Would you like to eat them here or there?

907
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:11,741
"I would not like to eat them anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.

908
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:15,120
"I do not like them, Sam-l-Am." Okay?

909
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:19,124
Now see, he was going to punch Sam-l-Am,
but he walked away.

910
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,418
You don't punch, see?
He walked away with it.

911
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:26,089
Where's Mommy?

912
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:29,426
Mommy had to work today.

913
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,930
Remember when you used
to work all the times?

914
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,391
Yeah, back when I had a real job.

915
00:58:36,933 --> 00:58:38,560
Do you miss work?

916
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:42,814
I guess. I suppose so. I miss it.

917
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:47,444
But don't get me wrong. It's not like
I don't like hanging out with you guys.

918
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:51,031
It's just that Daddy used to be
a big shot down at work.

919
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:56,536
I had my own office and a big, pretty view.
Remember that big, pretty view Daddy had?

920
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:59,622
I like it when you spin me around
in that cool chair.

921
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,750
Yeah, that's a cool chair.

922
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,837
A lot of cool things about that job.
Cool chair...

923
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:09,090
I had people working underneath me...

924
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:12,886
and, just between you and I,
the pay wasn't that bad either.

925
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:17,265
- Put that down. What do you think of that?
- What is it?

926
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,893
What do you mean?
It's a dog in the sunshine.

927
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:22,771
- It doesn't look like one.
- That's because it's abstract.

928
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:25,523
You have to squint when you look at it.

929
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:28,735
And when you see it like this,
that's abstract.

930
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:30,445
Yeah? You see it?

931
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:33,990
How about if you tilt your head to the side?

932
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,910
- No, the other way.
- Still doesn't look like one.

933
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:40,163
Okay, well, what are you over there
working on, Michelangelo?

934
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:41,664
What is that?

935
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,509
There's nothing abstract
about that now, is it?

936
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:54,511
Thanks.

937
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,180
That's pretty good.

938
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:59,641
You got Daddy's head
looking kind of round, though.

939
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:01,309
Is my head that round?

940
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:05,730
- No. But I got your mustache.
- Yeah, I see. A nice green mustache.

941
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:08,149
That's all right, son.

942
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,903
I just paid the mortgage,
the car loan and the electric bill.

943
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:14,489
Look at the balance
in the checking account.

944
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:18,535
- 74 cents.
- Yeah. That's right, 74 cents.

945
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:21,371
- You are my Superman.
- You got that right.

946
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:25,625
I've worked hard, and I think
it's time to let off a little of my frustration.

947
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:28,128
It's time for you
to take care of your Superman.

948
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:30,672
- My Superman. Come here, baby.
- That's right.

949
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,758
No! The monster's going to get me!

950
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,388
It's probably a nightmare.

951
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:42,517
- Be right back.
- Okay, hurry up. Mommy's coming!

952
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,436
No, I want Daddy.

953
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:49,774
- Did everything go okay?
- Yeah, everything's just fine.

954
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:57,407
What's that face for?

955
01:00:57,657 --> 01:01:00,201
Since when does he like you
better than he likes me?

956
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:02,120
No, don't even trip. It's not like that.

957
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:05,915
I've just been spending more time with him,
so he wanted me.

958
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:07,834
He's getting much more confident.

959
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:10,462
Remember how he wouldn't play
with anyone else at first?

960
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:13,590
Now, he's even playing with
that kid, Crispin.

961
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:17,427
Crispin happened to say "thank you"
at lunch today without being told.

962
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,305
And that little girl Becca, she can read.
She's just a baby.

963
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:24,976
I seen her pick up a "Curious George" book,
sit down and read like a grownup.

964
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,811
What's that face?

965
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:32,150
I haven't seen you this excited
about something in a long time.

966
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,945
Yeah, I ain't going to front.

967
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:38,656
Them little crumb snatchers
got under my skin.

968
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:43,328
Mrs. Plager, I cannot continue
to expose the other children...

969
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:46,915
to such dangerous, self-destructive,
highly addictive behavior.

970
01:01:46,998 --> 01:01:49,167
So either Juliette stops the thumb sucking...

971
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,712
or you'll just have to find
yourself another preschool.

972
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:01,179
Are you busy?

973
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:04,641
Just pruning a few weeds from the garden.
What is it?

974
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:07,602
Okay, I just thought you should know...

975
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:10,814
we've lost three more students.

976
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:13,983
Are you seriously suggesting
you don't know where they are?

977
01:02:14,025 --> 01:02:15,110
No, ma'am.

978
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,530
- I know where they are.
- So do I.

979
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:22,909
Daddy Day Care.

980
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:25,370
First, it was amusing.

981
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:27,831
Then it was annoying.

982
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:31,209
Now it's really starting to tick me off.

983
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:35,505
Get me a copy of
"Child Day Care Services Regulations".

984
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:53,064
Phil, get the door.

985
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,525
Get the door!

986
01:02:57,235 --> 01:02:59,195
All right, I got it.

987
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:06,411
Mr. Kubitz. What are you doing here?

988
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:09,497
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's a great time.

989
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:13,168
Is the man of the house at home?

990
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:15,045
"Man of the house."

991
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:19,257
Charlie! Mr. Kubitz is here
from Child Services!

992
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:21,217
I'll be right there.

993
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,512
So, let me ask you. Where are the kids?

994
01:03:24,554 --> 01:03:26,890
Outside. Marvin's giving them
a puppet show.

995
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:29,934
Nice. What's on the program? "Pinocchio"?
"Little Red Riding Hood"?

996
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,062
No, "Wrath of Khan".

997
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:33,897
- Mr. Kubitz. Hi!
- Hi.

998
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:36,858
- Wait! What are you doing?
- What?

999
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,361
- What's wrong with your face?
- My face?

1000
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:43,365
What's all that stuff, man? Come on.
What's the matter with you?

1001
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:46,201
Becca and Jamie.

1002
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:50,830
If you'll excuse me,
I have to see two little girls...

1003
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,374
because now I'm a big girl.

1004
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:56,586
He's having fun with...
Mr. Kubitz, so what brings you here today?

1005
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:01,508
- I've received another complaint...
- I guess we know who that came from.

1006
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:06,680
I understand that you've acquired
three more children since my last visit.

1007
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:08,598
Yes. We're 14 altogether now.

1008
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,434
It's still three adults,
so we're still under the 5:1 ratio.

1009
01:04:11,476 --> 01:04:14,396
Right. But you see,
it's a totally different issue this time.

1010
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:16,398
Charlie, can I talk to you for a second?

1011
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:19,943
Mr. Kubitz, excuse me a second.
I'm going to go handle this.

1012
01:04:20,026 --> 01:04:21,403
- Have a cookie.
- Sure. Thanks.

1013
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:23,071
What's going on?

1014
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,664
- What's up?
- Flash is gone.

1015
01:04:32,747 --> 01:04:35,583
- What do you mean, gone? Gone where?
- I can't find him.

1016
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,712
- You looked everywhere? In the garage?
- Everywhere.

1017
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:40,255
What we going to do?

1018
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:43,466
- Is there some kind of problem out here?
- Not at all, Mr. Kubitz.

1019
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,011
We're just having a little conversation
about the...

1020
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:49,139
- Okay, because if it's...
- No problem at all. Why don't you...

1021
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:52,183
Kids! Why don't you meet
our good friend, Mr. Kubitz.

1022
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,061
- Say hi.
- Hi, Mr. Kubitz.

1023
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:56,396
Hi, guys.

1024
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:59,149
Wouldn't it be nice
if Mr. Kubitz played with you guys...

1025
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:01,359
while we had an important conversation?

1026
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:03,570
- Would you be so kind?
- Is that a good idea?

1027
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:06,948
We're having a grown-up conversation
the kids shouldn't be privy to.

1028
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,076
- So just for a second. Please.
- Sure. That's different.

1029
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,830
- I'll check the back yard.
- I'll go upstairs.

1030
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:15,874
I'll check the basement.

1031
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,626
Do we have a basement?

1032
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:46,279
We have to do the laundry. God!

1033
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,546
Oh, my God! They vaporized him!

1034
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:07,634
He couldn't have got far. I'll call the police.

1035
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:11,971
- I'll call his parents.
- Lf only I were a Betazoid, I could sense him.

1036
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,727
- Which kid is this?
- I don't know. What's your name?

1037
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:19,771
Tony.

1038
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:25,944
- Flash's name is Tony.
- Actually, Flash's name is Wally West...

1039
01:06:32,617 --> 01:06:37,080
- Why aren't you wearing your Flash suit?
- I don't want to be Flash anymore.

1040
01:06:37,163 --> 01:06:40,417
- You don't? Who you want to be?
- Tony.

1041
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,253
- Hear that? He wants to be Tony.
- He wants to be Tony.

1042
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:47,007
That's nice. You want to be Tony.
That's great.

1043
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,259
Tony, have a cookie. Have a fresh one.

1044
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:49,551
What are you talking about? I do love you.
I'm just not in love with you.

1045
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:54,264
What are you talking about? I do love you.
I'm just not in love with you.

1046
01:06:54,472 --> 01:06:57,058
Fifteen months of therapy,
that's the best you can do?

1047
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,020
That is the dumbest line I have ever heard.

1048
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:03,773
My mother was right about you.

1049
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:07,485
Wait.

1050
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:10,947
For what? You think this will change?
You think I'll change?

1051
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,158
You think this is what I had in mind?

1052
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:15,535
Being a 55-year-old man,
living with his mother?

1053
01:07:15,618 --> 01:07:18,288
You think that's my idea of a good time?

1054
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,582
I love passive-aggressive losers.

1055
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:28,590
According to state regulations,
a child-care center in a family home...

1056
01:07:28,673 --> 01:07:31,718
is limited to a maximum of 12 children.

1057
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:36,931
- We have plenty of room here for these kids.
- I don't make the rules, I enforce them.

1058
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:40,226
You can't have more than 12 kids
at this kind of location.

1059
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,355
So if we want to stay in business,
we have to fire two kids.

1060
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:47,859
Unless you want to move to a permanent
facility somewhere else, then yes.

1061
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:56,409
So, who do we cut loose?

1062
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,787
How about Becca and Jamie?

1063
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:01,456
I can't do it.

1064
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:04,334
We got to do something.

1065
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,379
Why don't we get a bigger space?

1066
01:08:07,837 --> 01:08:11,049
"Space. The Final Frontier."

1067
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:13,843
I'm serious. Harridan said we're not real.
Let's get real.

1068
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:16,638
Let's get a bigger space, more kids,
hire more people...

1069
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,515
and give this woman a run for her money.

1070
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:21,476
- Great. Let's get a new space.
- Yeah, Final Frontier!

1071
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:25,480
If you don't stop with that "Star Trek",
I'll push you in that sticker bush. Stop!

1072
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:29,984
No! I'm saying that there is a space available
called "The Final Frontier."

1073
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:33,154
This used to be my home away from home.

1074
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:38,243
Jerry, the guy who owned this place,
had the ultimate collection of memorabilia.

1075
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:41,371
You know what he had? Tricorder.

1076
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:44,958
That Ensign Riley wore
in "The Doomsday Machine".

1077
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,377
Yeah. I never saw that episode.

1078
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:50,547
I was with him, not watching also.

1079
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:54,843
Needs a lot of work.

1080
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:57,887
That just means we can fix it up
how we want to fix it up.

1081
01:08:57,929 --> 01:09:00,515
But we'll need some money to do that.

1082
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:03,351
To make money, you got to spend money.

1083
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:06,104
To spend money, you got to have money.

1084
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:09,149
"Rock for Daddy Day Care.

1085
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:12,527
"Help us finance our new permanent home."

1086
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:15,238
Do you know what this means?

1087
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:19,409
It's a chance to improve ourselves
through a little healthy competition?

1088
01:09:19,492 --> 01:09:22,829
No, you bubbleheaded idiot.
It's a death sentence.

1089
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:26,207
If they get their hands
on a big enough space, they'll ruin me.

1090
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:29,377
They're selling fun. I can't compete with fun.

1091
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,508
I should've crushed them
in the beginning when they were weak.

1092
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:39,554
It'll be harder now, but I have no choice.
I've got to stop them.

1093
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:43,141
How are you gonna do that?

1094
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,810
By any means necessary.

1095
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,871
Yeah, ride the pony.

1096
01:10:06,122 --> 01:10:07,624
Pet the goat.

1097
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,169
Get a T-shirt made. Something to eat.

1098
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,171
Enjoy the music!

1099
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,517
- They're showing "Logan's Run", Friday...
- Friday night at 8:00.

1100
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:11,813
If you're not busy Friday nights...

1101
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:15,817
- maybe you'd like to...
- Yeah, sure.

1102
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:17,485
Great.

1103
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:20,530
So we're talking, like,
just dinner, bath, bed?

1104
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:22,907
- The works?
- What?

1105
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:26,119
You want me to baby-sit
so you can go to the movie, right?

1106
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:28,872
Marvin, I want you to go with me.

1107
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,335
Okay.

1108
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:38,048
- Okay. Great.
- All right. Here's your thing.

1109
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:47,849
Thank you very much. Okay. There you go.

1110
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:58,735
I don't think we should do this.

1111
01:11:58,818 --> 01:12:02,280
Jennifer, my dear, in life there are
winners and there are losers.

1112
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:05,492
And if you want to be a winner,
sometimes you have to play dirty.

1113
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:34,187
I'll show you. I'll paint my face first.
And then you paint yourself.

1114
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:37,440
See? Put a little paint.
And I'm just going to...

1115
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:39,442
What's wrong?

1116
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:43,863
That's not paint! It's glue!

1117
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:07,303
Could I have some more
of this delicious potato salad?

1118
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:10,348
Have you tried it? Really. It is so good.

1119
01:13:13,226 --> 01:13:15,770
- What's up?
- Look.

1120
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:18,857
And they got into everything
except for the pies.

1121
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:22,652
Okay, but don't panic.
We'll just sell the people pies, that's all.

1122
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:26,990
Wow. Goats really love pie.

1123
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,706
Leave them on for two hours.

1124
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,458
You got it.

1125
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:42,172
Everybody just take a deep breath
and let's go back to having fun.

1126
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:43,965
Okay?

1127
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:02,359
- How'd we do?
- We haven't even put a dent in it.

1128
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:10,992
- Hello?
- Charlie, Jim Fields.

1129
01:14:11,117 --> 01:14:14,162
How's your vacation going?
No, I'm just pulling your leg.

1130
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:16,956
Listen, buddy,
are you still looking for work?

1131
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,876
{y:i}I've got a job for you,
{y:i}unless you've got other offers.

1132
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:23,129
No, that's really interesting.

1133
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,256
But I've got something going on right now.

1134
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:27,884
Before you say no,
let me fax you over the proposal.

1135
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,804
You can take a look at the numbers,
you think about it...

1136
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:32,472
then you get back to me.

1137
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,933
- Yeah.
{y:i}- Okay. Great.

1138
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:38,061
You say hi to the wife and daughter... Son.

1139
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:54,744
Let me guess. You couldn't get
child services to come back...

1140
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:56,079
so you're doing the inspection.

1141
01:14:56,162 --> 01:14:58,873
I apologize. I don't like to be sneaky.

1142
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:00,959
Still, rules are rules.

1143
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:05,296
- May I come in? I've a proposition for you.
- Yeah, please do.

1144
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:11,428
Can I get you some coffee or tea or water...

1145
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:14,556
- or eye of newt, maybe?
- Water would be lovely.

1146
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:17,267
- Thank you.
- Water. That's an easy one.

1147
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:21,855
You don't mind tap water, do you?
We're out of the bottled water.

1148
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:30,071
So, Miss Harridan, why are you here?

1149
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:35,118
You seem smart, talented, highly ambitious.

1150
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:38,038
What on earth are you doing
running a day care center?

1151
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:40,540
Maybe I enjoy running a day care center.

1152
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:44,461
Obviously. But is this really how you want
to spend the rest of your life?

1153
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:48,298
As a businessman,
you'd have money, power, respect.

1154
01:15:48,798 --> 01:15:52,135
You going to throw that all away
to baby-sit a bunch of 3-year-olds?

1155
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:56,222
I said I'd listen to your proposition.
I'm all ears, and I got other things to do.

1156
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:59,309
- So if you'd be so kind...
- All right. Here it is:

1157
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:03,188
If Daddy Day Care should close,
for whatever reason...

1158
01:16:03,563 --> 01:16:06,941
I'll take all your children
for the price you charge.

1159
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,320
Topflight education at rock-bottom prices.

1160
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:12,280
Think about it.

1161
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,869
Now wait a minute.

1162
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:21,164
You're blowing us off
for Cottony Cotton Balls?

1163
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:25,543
No, Cotton Candy Puffs.
Apparently the whole thing was my idea.

1164
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:28,129
They'll double my salary
and let me run the division.

1165
01:16:28,171 --> 01:16:30,173
So, yes, I am taking myself back.

1166
01:16:30,256 --> 01:16:33,176
Go ahead,
if that's what's important to you. I mean...

1167
01:16:33,259 --> 01:16:37,013
Phil and I can manage.
We'll just find somebody else. Right?

1168
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:38,973
I'm going, too.

1169
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:44,521
This is worse than
when Spock betrayed Kirk...

1170
01:16:44,562 --> 01:16:47,232
- on "Star Trek V".
- It's not like that.

1171
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:51,319
Come back with us. Not in the mailroom,
but to be part of our team.

1172
01:16:51,361 --> 01:16:54,364
I don't want to be on that team.
I want to be on this team.

1173
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:57,992
We thought a lot about this, man.
It's a great opportunity.

1174
01:16:58,076 --> 01:17:01,079
No, this right here is a great opportunity.

1175
01:17:01,162 --> 01:17:05,500
This business is the one that has limits.
And we've reached them, okay?

1176
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,877
Me and Phil,
we got responsibilities to think about.

1177
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:12,841
- We got futures to take into consideration.
- What about now? What about the kids?

1178
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:16,177
These kids were fine before Daddy Day Care.

1179
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:20,348
- They'll be fine when it's over.
- You tell yourself that, Charlie.

1180
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:23,643
I finally found a place where I fit in...

1181
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:27,022
where I feel like I'm doing something good,
and you guys just...

1182
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:28,940
You just spoil it all.

1183
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,699
That couldn't have gone worse.

1184
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:40,952
If you think that went bad,
wait till we tell the kids.

1185
01:17:57,218 --> 01:17:59,012
Can I go to work with you?

1186
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:02,557
No, you can't go to work with me,
but you can come visit me at work.

1187
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,352
And Daddy will be home at night
and on the weekends.

1188
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:10,023
- We'll still have lots of fun together.
- Will Phil and Marvin still be here?

1189
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:13,693
No, I'm sorry, little man.
They won't be around anymore.

1190
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:17,155
It's just for a while, right?

1191
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:20,950
Then you're going to come back
and do Daddy Day Care again.

1192
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,829
No, this is from now on.

1193
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:28,124
Daddy Day Care,
we're not doing that anymore, Ben.

1194
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,128
Let me explain it to you like this:

1195
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:35,340
If Daddy does this, I can get money for us.

1196
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:39,511
And I can use that money
to take care of the house and to buy food...

1197
01:18:39,594 --> 01:18:42,430
and clothes and toys for you to play with.

1198
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:45,183
I'll sell all my toys.

1199
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:48,144
Why you want to sell all your toys?

1200
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:53,149
If I don't have toys, we don't need money,
and you can stay with me.

1201
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:58,655
I wish it was that simple, Ben.

1202
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:05,787
The development department will have
the first samples ready by next week.

1203
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,956
Okay, let's kick it around.

1204
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:11,251
What do you think of
when you think of cotton candy?

1205
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,336
- Clowns.
- Chocolate.

1206
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:16,172
Cavities.

1207
01:19:17,632 --> 01:19:20,552
Hyperactivity, cavities, and dentist bills.
That's what I...

1208
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:23,346
I've been to the other side
and I've seen firsthand.

1209
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,434
When kids eat this stuff, they crash down
so hard they need an air bag.

1210
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:29,894
You know what
the ingredients are to these balls?

1211
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,980
- Puffs.
- They're "puffs." I'm sorry.

1212
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:34,649
You know what's in here?
Red dye number four and sugar.

1213
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:38,278
You know what? Charlie is absolutely right.
You can't ignore the reality.

1214
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:41,489
Parents are not going to want to buy
this product for their kids.

1215
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:44,701
Not unless those kids stomp and scream...

1216
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:49,497
and bang their little heads on the floor
till blood comes out of their ears.

1217
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:51,875
Charlie, you got those figures
that I gave you?

1218
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:55,128
Yeah, I got them right here.
Just give me a second to...

1219
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:59,507
We had an independent marketing firm
do some preliminary research...

1220
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:02,552
to sort out the core value of this product.

1221
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:05,889
The subjects that were tested,
aged two to six...

1222
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:08,224
which are key branding years...

1223
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:13,938
- Charlie, you want to join us?
- I'm sorry about that, Jim. Yeah.

1224
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:18,443
Why don't you tell everybody
what the core value is?

1225
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:20,987
What's the most important thing?

1226
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:25,909
My kid.

1227
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:34,292
My kid, Jim, that's the most important thing.

1228
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:38,088
And I think I've made a tremendous mistake.

1229
01:20:38,588 --> 01:20:41,675
And so, I quit.

1230
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:48,431
What are you doing to me? You scared me.

1231
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:51,226
- How was the marketing meeting?
- I quit.

1232
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:53,728
- What?
- I quit.

1233
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:55,980
- You quit?
- I quit and I feel great.

1234
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,982
- You should quit with me.
- I should quit?

1235
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,151
- You should quit right now.
- We just got here.

1236
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,737
You want to feel how I'm feeling?
Quit. Come on.

1237
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:05,323
- Quit!
- Quit with me.

1238
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:17,127
You weren't going to sell the carrot suit,
were you? The kids love that.

1239
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:29,848
This stuff...

1240
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:33,268
is not for sale!

1241
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:34,436
A literal reader of the text might say...

1242
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,230
A literal reader of the text might say...

1243
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:40,567
that Goldilocks ate the "porridge"...

1244
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,445
because she was "hungry."

1245
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:46,114
But what would Freud say?

1246
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:50,827
Language skills are a critical component
of childhood development.

1247
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,788
They're part of the core curriculum
here at Chapman.

1248
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:55,749
If you'll follow me this way.

1249
01:21:56,875 --> 01:22:00,920
On the path of life,
the proper first steps are essential.

1250
01:22:01,504 --> 01:22:04,591
With our firm guidance, your children...

1251
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:07,844
will take those steps right here at Chapman.

1252
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:11,806
Our philosophy is that
a child is like a climbing vine.

1253
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:15,560
With structure to cling to,
and the right gardener to tend them...

1254
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:19,647
- they'll grow to the sky.
- That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.

1255
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:23,360
We're not talking about plants,
we're talking about kids.

1256
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:27,572
I know you don't want this woman pruning
and cutting and weeding your 3-year-olds.

1257
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:30,116
Some people are uncomfortable
with achievement.

1258
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,788
No, what I'm uncomfortable with
is treating a little kid like it's an adult.

1259
01:22:34,996 --> 01:22:38,583
If your kids come here, they'll be
miserable in four different languages.

1260
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,544
Five. We start Portuguese in the fall.

1261
01:22:43,421 --> 01:22:45,632
How many languages
do you listen to them in?

1262
01:22:45,715 --> 01:22:49,552
You ever stop trying to shove knowledge
down their throat and just talk to them?

1263
01:22:49,594 --> 01:22:51,137
Listen to what they want.

1264
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:53,431
They're children,
they don't know what they want.

1265
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:57,352
Yes, they do know what they want.
All of them. And they're all different.

1266
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:00,355
We took some time, talked to the kids,
got to know them a bit.

1267
01:23:00,397 --> 01:23:04,526
- It made a difference. It helped them.
- Please. Share your success.

1268
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:08,780
Why don't you tell these people exactly
how you help their children?

1269
01:23:14,077 --> 01:23:17,288
Max over here is potty-trained now, okay?

1270
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:18,623
- I don't miss.
- That's right.

1271
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:22,210
- And Becca learned how to read.
- Yes, I did.

1272
01:23:22,585 --> 01:23:26,339
And Crispin is the most polite kid
you'd ever want to meet.

1273
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:30,051
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You are most welcome, Crispin.

1274
01:23:30,427 --> 01:23:32,762
And I made friends.

1275
01:23:35,181 --> 01:23:38,309
That's right, little man,
you made some friends.

1276
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:43,898
As of this moment Daddy Day Care
is back in business.

1277
01:23:46,943 --> 01:23:51,823
- Don't be a fool. You won't make a nickel.
- We might not get rich, but we'll manage.

1278
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:53,867
Excuse me. All right.

1279
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:55,910
How about that?

1280
01:24:01,499 --> 01:24:06,087
Any boob can run a child-care center.
It takes a family to raise some children.

1281
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:10,884
- We're going to be a family from now on.
- Family? What a laughable concept!

1282
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:13,345
We'll just laugh our way down the driveway.

1283
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:15,889
- Have a pleasant day.
- Bye, Miss Harridan.

1284
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:34,824
Come on! Let's go!

1285
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:38,078
Get in there! Come on! Let's go!

1286
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:42,957
Come on! Hold up!

1287
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:49,547
- Everybody's holding hands, right?
- Right.

1288
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,387
Let's go.

1289
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:01,643
"Daddy Day Care."

1290
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:04,771
Jennifer, how could you?

1291
01:25:05,146 --> 01:25:08,525
It's a really great place to work.
You should apply there.

1292
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:11,444
Or not.

1293
01:25:14,948 --> 01:25:18,159
- Have a nice day, Miss Harridan.
- That's nice.

1294
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:28,545
Stop!

1295
01:26:24,684 --> 01:26:25,727
Help!

1296
01:26:26,144 --> 01:26:27,312
Help! Stuck!

1297
01:26:34,027 --> 01:26:36,404
All right, here I come.
What's going on here?

1298
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:37,489
Help!

1299
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:40,325
I'm stuck!

1300
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:42,285
Loser.

1301
01:26:49,876 --> 01:26:51,002
Loser.

1302
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:57,759
Little man.

1303
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:02,722
I'd say this wasn't a bad tradeoff.

1304
01:27:03,181 --> 01:27:04,516
Yeah, Dad.

1305
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:44,848
{y:i}And, action.

1306
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:49,394
We can spend... You know, we can't spend
money without having it.

1307
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:51,521
Hold on one second.

1308
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:54,190
What, are you being beamed up?

1309
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:56,026
- It's Captain Kirk.
- It is!

1310
01:27:58,778 --> 01:27:59,821
{y:i}Action.

1311
01:28:00,071 --> 01:28:02,782
- What are you doing to me?
- Pudding on my hand.

1312
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,662
Okay, wait a minute.

1313
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:15,920
- I would never push you in a sticker bush.
- You couldn't push me.

1314
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:17,839
No, I'd use a shovel on you.

1315
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:22,135
Busy.

1316
01:28:22,218 --> 01:28:25,347
Some other kids around here
hanging out with you. How that sound?

1317
01:28:25,388 --> 01:28:28,683
- See, you going to have to work on it.
- "Mazel tov".

1318
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,519
Remember when you broke my yo-yo?

1319
01:28:31,936 --> 01:28:34,522
- I broke...
- And you never gave me a new one.

1320
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:37,275
That's why you sent me to bed.

1321
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,860
You've been writing.

1322
01:28:39,235 --> 01:28:43,114
No, I can't even write my letters.

1323
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:44,741
{y:i}What's going on here?

1324
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:52,415
You're killing me. You're really killing me.

1325
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:55,335
Joe Frazier's Smokin' Skillets!

1326
01:28:58,254 --> 01:29:01,758
These skillets were made
in the City of Brotherly Love.

1327
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:05,679
- That's a good thing.
- Okay, Eddie.

1328
01:29:06,262 --> 01:29:09,307
They gave you
a little too much direction, didn't they?

1329
01:29:16,606 --> 01:29:18,566
Okay, stop before you pee on yourself.

1330
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:20,694
- What is my line?
- "I'll sell all my toys."

1331
01:29:20,777 --> 01:29:22,904
I'll sell all my toys.

1332
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:27,075
I'll say my other line over again,
because I messed it up. I say, "You..."

1333
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:29,577
- Action!
- Okay, thank you.

1334
01:29:31,121 --> 01:29:33,581
{y:i}- Let it go for a second. There.
{y:i}- Thank you.

1335
01:29:36,126 --> 01:29:38,753
That's why I know
we haven't been to the moon.

1336
01:29:40,839 --> 01:29:44,426
Miss Harridan says
it's preparing me for my future.

1337
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:50,849
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1338
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:56,146
- What do you feel like eating?
- A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

1339
01:29:56,187 --> 01:29:58,273
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

1340
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,608
- I don't know.
- After this scene.

1341
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:01,985
If I give you...

1342
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:04,779
What's so funny?
