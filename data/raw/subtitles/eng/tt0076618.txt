1
00:00:54,034 --> 00:01:01,031
Who will rescue me

2
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:46,975
Oh, who will rescue me

3
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:55,489
Who will rescue me

4
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,433
I'm lost at sea

5
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:19,036
Without a friend

6
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,313
This journey

7
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:29,287
Will it ever end

8
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:35,984
Who will

9
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:39,930
Rescue

10
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,069
Me

11
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:56,839
Rescue me

12
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,290
Rescue me

13
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:03,980
Attention, please.
The economic and social council
will convene in five minutes.

14
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,914
G-Good day, sir.

15
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,884
G-Good day, Mr. Ambassador.

16
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:45,988
How do you do, madam?

17
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,550
Order. Order.
This emergency meeting...

18
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:52,257
of the International Rescue Aid Society
is now in session.

19
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:56,359
Delegates, you have been summoned
from all corners of the globe...

20
00:05:56,436 --> 00:06:00,566
because we have reason to believe
that someone is in distress.

21
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,101
As you know, our society has never
failed to answer a call for help.

22
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,510
Hear! Hear!

23
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:14,645
We will face the portrait of the beloved
founder of our society, Euripides Mouse.

24
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,622
Delegates, hands over hearts.

25
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,793

27
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,305
Heads held high
Touch the sky

28
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:40,813
You mean everything to me

29
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,475
In a fix, in a bind
Call on us anytime

30
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:48,180
We'll appear from nowhere
Mighty are we

32
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:55,358

Heads held high
Touch the sky

36
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:10,100
You mean everything to me

37
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:13,509
In a jam, in a scrape
And you think no escape

38
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,346
Do not fear, we'll be here
Courageous are we

Heads held high
Touch the sky

42
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:33,191
Our hearts we pledge to thee

43
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:39,538
Mouse scouts,
bring in the bottle.

44
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,714
Mr. Bernard, if you please.

45
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,391
C-C-Coming through.
Uh, pardon me.

46
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,051
Have a care there.

47
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,496
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.
Uh-- Excuse me, sir.

48
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,830
- Oops.
- Egad!

49
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,501
Delegates, this is
no time for levity.

50
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:16,269
Serious business, you know.
Serious business.

51
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,945
Now what?

52
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,285
Sir, there, uh-- there-- there are
1 3 steps on this ladder.

53
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:33,257
Oh, superstitious nonsense.

54
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:53,004
What next?

55
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,707
Oh, um, sorry, sir.

56
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,876
I'll, uh-- I'll have it--
have it out in-in a jiffy, sir.

57
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:18,861
''To Morningside Orphanage, New York.''

58
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:22,396
It's difficult to decipher.
I can't make it out.

59
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,104
''I am...

60
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,115
in terrible...

61
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,986
terrible trouble.''

62
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:37,580
Oh, oh, dear,
it's all watered out.

63
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,124
''Hurry.

64
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:41,683
Help. Penny.''

65
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:45,754
Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?

66
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,699
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?

67
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:51,862
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.

68
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,702
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please...

69
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:58,039
please, may I have this assignment?

70
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:02,047
You, Miss Bianca?

71
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:05,778
Dear lady, it's absolutely
without precedent.

72
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:10,551
I mean, it's not like the old days
when it was a man's world.

73
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:15,492
However, I suppose
there has to be a first time.

74
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,791
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.

75
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:22,563
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca
should go. It could be dangerous.

76
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,798
I mean, I mean, any--
anything could-- could happen to her.

77
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:32,476
You see, dear lady,
before our janitor interrupted...

78
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:36,982
I was about to suggest that
you should have a co-agent go with you.

79
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,518
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?

80
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:48,393
Gentlemen, this is indeed a--
a most difficult decision to make.

81
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,991
I choose...

82
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,094
Mr. Bernard
to be my co-agent.

83
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:04,201
M-Me? Oh, th-that's--
that's really very, uh--

84
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:08,373
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.

85
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:12,441
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.

86
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,383
Oh, come on!

87
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,388
Bravo! Bravo!

88
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:24,289
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.

89
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:50,587
Morningside Orphanage.

90
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,920
Here. H-Here it is.

91
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:55,256
Three blocks down and...

92
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,161
uh, uh, four blocks over.

93
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:01,064
Well, why don't we take
the shortcut through the zoo?

94
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:04,797
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--

95
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,601
I-I don't know. I mean, it's--
you know, it could be risky.

96
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,471
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?

97
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,603
Through storm and rain
and dark of night--

98
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,079
Never fail to do what's right.

99
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:21,483
All right, duty calls.

100
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:42,103
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um,
maybe we'd better go back.

101
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,738
It's so dark in there.

102
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:48,144
Dark?

103
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:51,650
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?

104
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:56,450
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.

105
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,803
Wait for me!

106
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:40,527
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks
down and, uh, four blocks over?

107
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:44,730
What did you do
to make him so mad?

108
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:50,171
Nothing. He's just a--
just a grumpy old lion.

109
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:54,111
Well, after all, waking him up
in the middle of the night--

110
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,479
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?

111
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,780
I didn't wake him up
in the middle of the night.

112
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,946
I was walking through the thing,
and he just--

113
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:33,714
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around,
see what I can find.

114
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,867
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.

115
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,941
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.

116
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:59,739
Now we're getting somewhere.

117
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:03,043
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.

118
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,344
Boy, the things kids collect.

119
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,355
Do you think she could be
still here in the orphanage?

120
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:14,223
Well, s-she can't be. It says
on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''

121
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,523
Well, maybe she's been adopted.

122
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:20,054
No, because she would've
taken these things with her.

123
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:23,101
- Mice!
- Cat!

124
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,763
Now, lookee here, you two...

125
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,966
if folks find out
that mice moved in here...

126
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,771
I-I'll get kicked out,
lose my job.

127
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:36,679
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.

128
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,783
I'm a mite too old
to be chasin' mice.

129
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:46,757
Uh, sir, could--
could you tell us what happened
to a little girl named Penny?

130
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:50,853
I sure can. But you ain't
gonna find her around here.

131
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,525
The poor little thing
ran away.

132
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,262
When-- When was the last time
you saw Penny?

133
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:01,033
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.

134
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,200
Let's see now. Uh--

135
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:06,143
The last time I saw her...

136
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:11,206
she was sittin' over there
on her bed, all alone.

137
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:15,311
She looked awful sad,
and so I asked her--

138
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:18,016
What's wrong, Penny honey?

139
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,115
Nothing.

140
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:23,491
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.

141
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,894
You tell old Rufus, huh?

142
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:30,425
Well, it was adoption day
at the orphanage.

143
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,733
Well, what happened?

144
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:35,968
A man and a lady came
and looked at me...

145
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,510
but they choosed
a little redheaded girl.

146
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,844
She was prettier than me.

147
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:45,406
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!

148
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,544
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.

149
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,522
You're something extra special.

150
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,319
No, I'm not.

151
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:57,021
Why, someday a mama and a papa
will come to the orphanage...

152
00:16:57,096 --> 00:17:01,055
looking for a pretty little girl
just like you.

153
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:05,160
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.

154
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,070
But you've got to believe it.

155
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,074
Keep the faith, sweetheart.

156
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,536
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.

157
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,947
Well, faith is a bluebird...

158
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,043
you see from afar.

159
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,580
It's for real, and as sure
as the first evening star.

160
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:28,559
You can't touch it or buy it
or wrap it up tight...

161
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,187
but it's there just the same...

162
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:33,561
making things turn out right.

163
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:37,432
Can't touch it or buy it
or wrap it up tight...

164
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:43,408
but it's there just the same,
making things turn out right.

165
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:47,242
But whoever adopts me
has to adopt Teddy too.

166
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,576
Oh, they'll love him.

167
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:53,675
He doesn't eat much, does he?

168
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:57,814
Oh, here!
I brought you something.

169
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:03,158
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!

170
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:06,392
No! They're ginger snaps!

171
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:13,097
Well, an old codger like me
could use a little ginger.

172
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:19,104
I taked two extra ones
for lunch today.

173
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:22,807
We're not supposed to do that.

174
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:27,319
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.

175
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:29,946
I love you, Rufus.

176
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:36,859
Gee, we'd better hurry,
or we'll be late for supper!

177
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:45,559
She seemed happy enough,
but the next thing I heard...

178
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,265
Penny was gone.

179
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,830
Well, aren't-- aren't the police
still looking for her?

180
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,845
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.

181
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:58,145
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.

182
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:01,209
I just can't believe
that Penny would run away.

183
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:05,053
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.

184
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:10,221
Well, come to think of it,
there was.

185
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:14,494
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.

186
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,400
Get in what? W-With who?

187
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,633
Oh, a weird lady
tried to give Penny a ride...

188
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:24,164
but she wouldn't have anything to do
with trashy people like them.

189
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:26,234
Trashy people? Who?

190
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:30,373
She and her partner run
a sleazy pawn shop down the street.

191
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:34,044
Miss Bianca, we must
go down there and investigate.

192
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,920
Suit yourself, but you'd be
wasting your time going down there.

193
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,757
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.

194
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:47,492
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?

195
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:43,717
Bernard, uh, a child's book!

196
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,791
It's Penny's!

197
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,955
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.

198
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,431
W-What's so funny?

199
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,474
Y-Your tail!

200
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,437
Here, here,
let me help you fix it.

201
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:23,119
Who could be ringing
at this time of night?

202
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:26,426
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.

203
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,329
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!

204
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,996
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!

205
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:35,802
You've found the diamond!

206
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,034
Give you time?

207
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,807
You bungler!

208
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,213
You have been down there
for three months.

209
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:50,954
Bottles? What bottles?

210
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:57,890
You caught Penny
sending messages in bottles?

211
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,454
You blundering fool!

212
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:04,059
Can't you control a little girl?

213
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:08,470
Shut up! I am taking the next
flight down to Devil's Bayou!

214
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:18,809
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.

215
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,682
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.

216
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:33,590
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.

217
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,692
Leave him for a few weeks and--

218
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:48,705
Oh, why won't this
stupid thing close?

219
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:33,786
Out of my way, you road hog!

220
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,878
All passengers,
please report for flight 6 1 4.

221
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:05,185
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could
be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.

222
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:11,162
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does
have to pack a few things, you know.

223
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,030
Will Mr.Jenkins report
to the ticket counter, please?

224
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:36,452
All passengers, please report
for flight 6 1 4, now departing.

225
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,186
Flight leaves 6:45.

226
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,246
Oh, no, we missed the flight.

227
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:17,586
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.

228
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:19,893
You know that flights
are always late.

229
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:23,765
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.

230
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:27,738
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.

231
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:30,741
Luck? Flight 1 3?

232
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,502
Maybe we'd better take the train.

233
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,070
Wake up.!

234
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:39,276
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!

235
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,548
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?

236
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,385
Uh, h-h-hello?

237
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:48,017
Where have you been,
oh,you lazy knucklehead?

238
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:50,220
W-We-We just got here, sir.

239
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:53,924
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent
insisted on packing her, uh--

240
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,092
Look, bud, am I clear to land?

241
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,898
Traffc up here is thicker than
fleas on a hound dog's--

242
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:04,238
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog--
road hog-- Crazy--

243
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,541
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--

244
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:12,812
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.

245
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:16,082
Well, then give him
the permission to land.

246
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:21,558
Uh, Captain, you, uh--
you have our permission to land.

247
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:25,825
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!

248
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,961
Doesn't he fly beautifully?

249
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:34,437
And you wanted to take the train,
you 'fraidy cat.

250
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,906
'Fraidy cat?

251
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:40,342
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.

252
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,506
I mean, they serve,
uh, Roquefort, uh--

253
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:46,510
Pull up! Pull up!

254
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:13,305
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?

255
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:16,313
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.

256
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,214
Oh, great.

257
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:22,014
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.

258
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,016
Play it safe.

259
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,719
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.

260
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:33,356
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.

261
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:37,368
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville,
little lady.

262
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:41,566
All right, all right, uh, it's
most important we get to Devil's Bayou.

263
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,870
Well, now,
will you just keep your shirt on?

264
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:48,242
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder
in five minutes.

265
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:57,717
Eight, nine, ten, eleven...

266
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,815
twelve-- Oh, no.

267
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,827
There are 1 3 steps
on this ramp.

268
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:08,662
Well, why don't you
jump the last one?

269
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,071
This is your captain speaking.

270
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,008
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.

271
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:23,013
Just sit back
and leave the driving to me.

272
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:28,018
Miss Bianca, be sure
it's fastened good and tight.

273
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:31,021
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.

274
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,683
Say, bud,
read the checklist to me.

275
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,556
Uh, oh, yeah.

276
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,356
Goggles down.

277
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,122
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.

278
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,034
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.

279
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:48,402
''If at first you don't succeed...

280
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,467
try, try again.''

281
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:54,034
And here we go!

282
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,748
I sure wish
we'd have taken the train.

283
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,738
Oh, I just love takeoffs!

284
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:35,620
Captain, you fly beautifully.

285
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,087
It's just like being
on a ''roller scoater.''

286
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:48,260
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.

287
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:52,030
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.

288
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,522
Come along

289
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,859
Will there be sunshine shinin'

290
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,797
Will we find a silver linin'

291
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,961
Come along

292
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:29,302
Sing a song

293
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:34,311
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow

294
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:37,746
Sing a song

295
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:41,877
Is it wrong

296
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:44,513
To put all our hopes together

297
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:47,251
And wish for somethin'better

298
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:50,522
Is it wrong

299
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:53,689
To be loved

300
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,161
To face the future
with another

301
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,601
Who means more than any other

302
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:02,765
Is to be loved

303
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:08,045
We'll paint the grey clouds

304
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:12,209
With pretty rainbow hues

305
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:16,618
And we'll brush the gloom away

306
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:22,422
And save it for a rainy day

307
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:26,123
Rainy day

308
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:30,225
Oh, today

309
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:33,595
If troubles cast a shadow

310
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:39,406
And shadows make the sun
afraid to stay

311
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:43,743
Why, it's okay

312
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,113
'Cause there'll be
sunshine shinin'

313
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:48,550
And we'll find the silver linin'

314
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,748
Another day

315
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:56,086
Uh, listen to this.

316
00:31:56,161 --> 00:32:00,928
It says here Devil's Bayou
is uncharted and hazardous.

317
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,660
Each day's operations...

318
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,429
Hmm, interesting.

319
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:07,305
must be...

320
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,306
Good night, dear.

321
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,509
planned with...

322
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:14,442
care and--

323
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:23,344
Tomorrow is another day

324
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:25,446
Good night, Bianca.

325
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:34,089
How I hope you'll always stay

326
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:29,382
Penny!

327
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,978
Penny?

328
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,183
Penny, answer me!

329
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:36,885
Penny?

330
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:48,734
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!

331
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:52,208
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?

332
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:55,542
That little brat
has escaped again.

333
00:33:55,613 --> 00:34:00,107
Nero, Brutus,
bring her back, boys.

334
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:22,431
Why won't it start?

335
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,305
Snoops! What's wrong?

336
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:28,744
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.

337
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:31,145
Oh, shut up!

338
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:36,950
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!

339
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:56,265
Well, folks, we'll be landing
at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.

340
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,208
Your crew thanks you
for flying Albatross Air--

341
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,946
What in the--

342
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:12,519
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!

343
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,188
Bail out! Bail out!

344
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:20,790
Help!

345
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,356
Bernard!

346
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:30,200
Mayday! Mayday!

347
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:46,213
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?

348
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,556
Luke! Luke, wake up!

349
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:55,089
Luke, get down here!

350
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,707
It's Orville!

351
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,538
Oh, that Orville.

352
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,842
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!

353
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,905
I'm a-comin'.

354
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:24,118
Wow-wee!

355
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:28,097
This new batch
really packs a wallop!

356
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,602
Look out below!

357
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,048
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.

358
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:54,948
Say, cousin, you look like
you could use a swig of this.

359
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:57,324
It's good for what ails ya.

360
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,894
There.

361
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:05,299
Where are you folks from, anyway?

362
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:08,805
We're--

363
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:12,742
We're from New Y-- New York.

364
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,076
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna
hang around this creepy place long.

365
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,742
Clear the runway!

366
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,959
Great balls of fire!

367
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,186
Holy smoke!

368
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:59,655
Why don't you
watch where you're goin'!

369
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:50,674
Bernard,
it's that terrible Medusa.

370
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,403
I'd like to give her a few whacks
with my rollin' pin.

371
00:38:56,481 --> 00:39:01,077
We swamp folks would like to run her
clean out of our bayou.

372
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:04,588
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.

373
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,863
Why did you have to
go and spoil everything?

374
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:21,701
Nero, don't you dare
get my teddy bear wet.

375
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,436
Oh, it's that poor
little young 'un.

376
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:29,776
She's tryin' to run away again.

377
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:33,783
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.

378
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:41,423
Hurry! We've got to find out
where they're taking her!

379
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:51,431
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's
got the fastest boat around here.

380
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:55,438
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!

381
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:03,113
Send Evinrude back
as soon as you need help.

382
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,445
I'll round up the neighbors!

383
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:15,788
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!

384
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:26,427
You stop that, Brutus.

385
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:36,544
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.

386
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:44,520
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.

387
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:52,153
They gotta be
around here somewhere.

388
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:59,226
Oh, dear! We've lost them!

389
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,069
Jehoshaphat!

390
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:07,911
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!

391
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:12,339
Help me, Bernard!

392
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:22,858
Help! Bernard!

393
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,485
Bianca!

394
00:41:57,461 --> 00:42:00,624
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.

395
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:02,393
Keep trying, Evinrude.

396
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:09,463
Poor Evinrude.

397
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,271
Your carburettor
is all pooped out.

398
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:15,403
Bring her right on in, boys.

399
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:18,578
Come on.

400
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:22,210
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?

401
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,053
Put me down, Brutus!

402
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,151
Cranky old dragon.

403
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:32,890
Nice work. Good boys.

404
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:39,899
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!

405
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:42,599
There, there, Teddy.

406
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:47,633
I won't let them do that
to you again. Don't cry.

407
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:50,340
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.

408
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:53,781
All she ever thinks about
is that simple bear.

409
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,753
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero
and Brutus have your old teddy bear.

410
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:01,121
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em...

411
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:03,626
like you are, Mr. Snoops.

412
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:05,821
Oh, don't you sass me.

413
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:09,264
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty
little girl to her room.

414
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:14,297
I can go by myself, thank you.

415
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,184
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.

416
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:36,192
Look out! Here she comes!

417
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:51,804
Where is she? Where is she?

418
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:55,141
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.

419
00:43:55,212 --> 00:44:00,149
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?

420
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:03,050
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.

421
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,988
Those leather-headed lizards
of yours, they're supposed
to be patrolling the island.

422
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:09,151
They let her get away.

423
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:16,161
Ha! My precious pets.

424
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:21,227
We know who caught that
ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?

425
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:24,604
It was your brilliant idea to use
the little girl for this caper.

426
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:28,202
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.

427
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:33,239
I know, I know. She's the only one small
enough to squeeze down the black hole.

428
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:38,254
Yes, but why can't she
find my big diamond?

429
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:42,224
I don't know, but--
but just look at these beauties
that she brought up from the cave.

430
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,887
Oh, they'll sell
for a lot of cold cash.

431
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,953
Ow!

432
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:49,295
I wish you wouldn't do that.

433
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:52,859
She's insane. Utterly mad.

434
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:55,303
I want that diamond.

435
00:44:55,373 --> 00:45:00,310
I've got to have
the Devil's Eye!

436
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:03,245
You didn't leave the girl
down in the cave long enough.

437
00:45:03,314 --> 00:45:06,044
She won't take orders.

438
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:10,554
You are too soft.

439
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:13,647
But the water was rising
and the tide was coming in...

440
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:17,888
and all she did down there was fuss
about her teddy bear getting wet.

441
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:23,594
Snoops, you don't have a way
with children.

442
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,068
You must gain their confidence...

443
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:30,369
make them like you.

444
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:32,671
Yeah? How do you do that?

445
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:35,610
You force them
to like you, idiot!

446
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:37,670
At the next low tide...

447
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:41,980
I am going to
put her down there myself...

448
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:44,248
and keep her there...

449
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:46,516
until she finds it.

450
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,356
And it is as simple as that.

451
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:53,090
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?

452
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:56,133
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.

453
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,161
Yes.

454
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:02,103
Now come along, petsy-poos.

455
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:06,004
We gotta get Penny
out of here tonight.

456
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:26,562
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.

457
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:02,361
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!

458
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,699
Let go, you-you-you,
you big bullies, you!

459
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:48,462
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!

460
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:50,370
I mean now!

461
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,376
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!

462
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,213
Oh, Snoops, kill it!

463
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:09,048
Look! There's another one!

464
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,143
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?

465
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:43,986
Snoops! What's wrong?

466
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:45,653
I don't--

467
00:49:56,573 --> 00:49:58,507
E-E-Evinrude, over here!

468
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:14,249
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?

469
00:50:14,324 --> 00:50:17,088
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.

470
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:19,459
That-- That-- That terrible woman!

471
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:23,933
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.

472
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:27,095
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.

473
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:30,297
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.

474
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:34,270
Wh-What can two little mice do?

475
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:38,780
R-E-S-C-U-E

476
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,410
Rescue Aid Society

477
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:45,887
But, Bernard,
the Society's counting on us.

478
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:48,424
We can't quit now.

479
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,756
Oh, and that little girl.

480
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:53,228
We've just got to rescue her.

481
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:56,755
Rescue Aid Society

482
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,927
Heads held high

483
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:04,638
Penny dear!

484
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:09,168
Auntie Medusa
wants to talk to you!

485
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:11,305
High tide or not...

486
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:15,841
that little brat is going
to find me that diamond...

487
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:17,580
tomorrow...

488
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:19,451
or else!

489
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:23,822
Come in. Come in.

490
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:26,829
Did you want to see me, ma'am?

491
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:31,425
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.

492
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:35,495
Now, I am going to let
bygones be bygones.

493
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:39,770
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?

494
00:51:41,078 --> 00:51:43,638
Yes, you want me
to find that diamond.

495
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:46,649
That's right, dear!

496
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:50,517
But I've tried
hard as I could, honest.

497
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:52,680
Of course you have.

498
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:56,522
But we must try harder,
mustn't we?

499
00:51:56,593 --> 00:52:02,054
Then please will you take me back
to the orphanage like you promised?

500
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:04,464
Penny, don't you like it here?

501
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:08,027
A big, beautiful boat
all to yourself.

502
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:11,632
But if I don't get back
to the orphanage...

503
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:14,199
I'll never get 'dopted.

504
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:16,178
Adopted?

505
00:52:16,246 --> 00:52:18,874
What makes you think
anyone would want...

506
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:21,474
a homely little girl like you?

507
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:51,777
Be brave, little one

508
00:52:51,848 --> 00:52:53,611
Make a wish

509
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:57,245
For each sad little tear

510
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:59,619
Hold your head up

511
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,784
Though no one is near

512
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:09,287
Someone's waiting for you

513
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:14,102
Don't cry, little one

514
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:16,401
There'll be a smile

515
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:20,466
Where a frown used to be

516
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:26,312
You'll be part of the love
that you see

517
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:32,253
Someone's waiting for you

518
00:53:33,657 --> 00:53:36,592
Always keep a little prayer

519
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,458
In your pocket

520
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:45,934
And you're sure
to see the light

521
00:53:46,003 --> 00:53:51,566
Soon there'll bejoy
and happiness

522
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,839
And your little world

523
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:58,608
Will be bright

524
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:03,817
Have faith, little one

525
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:09,917
Till your hopes and your wishes
come true

526
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:13,485
You must try to be brave

527
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:16,691
Little one

528
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:22,433
Someone's waiting

529
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:27,000
To love

530
00:54:27,077 --> 00:54:32,481
You

531
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:43,286
Good night, Teddy.

532
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,794
Sleep tight.

533
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:48,797
Oh, we almost forgot
to say our prayers.

534
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:55,468
Please bless Rufus and Teddy...

535
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:58,303
and all the kids at the orphanage--

536
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:03,210
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.

537
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,216
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.

538
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:11,220
Because running away
isn't working. Amen.

539
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:15,423
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--

540
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:18,928
We'll be all right.

541
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:30,932
Penny. Penny.

542
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:35,540
Yes?

543
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:40,208
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.

544
00:55:41,418 --> 00:55:45,218
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?

545
00:55:45,288 --> 00:55:48,553
We found the bottle with-- with your
message, and we've come to rescue you.

546
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:52,220
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!

547
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:56,759
Didn't you bring
somebody big with you...

548
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,858
like the police?

549
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:01,802
Uh, no, there's--
there's just the-- the two of us.

550
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:06,400
But if the three of us work together,
and we have a little faith--

551
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:08,444
That's what Rufus said.

552
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:11,481
Faith makes things turn out right.

553
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:15,541
Penny, I know it's late, but we
have to escape tonight, right now.

554
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:19,214
But I just got caught
by Brutus and Nero.

555
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:21,553
Look what they did to my pants.

556
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:24,890
Yeah, and they're-- they're still
down there guarding the gangplank.

557
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:30,558
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.

558
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:34,070
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.

559
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:37,436
See there? The elevator.

560
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:40,067
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.

561
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,740
Great idea.

562
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:49,308
Now, uh, wha-wha--
what can we use for bait?

563
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:51,320
Oh, they'll eat anything.

564
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:54,649
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.

565
00:56:54,724 --> 00:56:58,990
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow
the scent right into the elevator.

566
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:01,758
And I'll slam the door.

567
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:04,596
And would that make Medusa mad.

568
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:06,932
Brutus! Nero!

569
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:10,097
Did you let that little brat
escape again?

570
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:12,266
You're too soft.

571
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:18,211
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.

572
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,715
That's exactly like Medusa.

573
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:25,552
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.

574
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:29,718
And we'll be so far ahead,
they'll never catch us.

575
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:33,661
Wait a minute. She-- She might
catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.

576
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,188
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.

577
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:42,370
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up
wh-wh-while we're starting it?

578
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:44,703
W-We're in trouble.

579
00:57:44,774 --> 00:57:46,901
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.

580
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:49,912
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?

581
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,076
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.

582
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,983
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.

583
00:57:57,053 --> 00:58:00,352
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.

584
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,653
It's just got to work.

585
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:06,992
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.

586
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,930
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!

587
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:14,729
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?

588
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:20,374
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--

589
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:23,879
I bet those two are up to something.

590
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:27,883
Gee, I don't wanna go down
that awful black hole again.

591
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,044
Don't worry about that, dear.

592
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,020
You must hurry and get dressed.

593
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:33,885
Come on.
We haven't got much time.

594
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:37,553
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.

595
00:58:39,863 --> 00:58:42,889
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.

596
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:44,763
An-And hurry!

597
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:40,888
Ya-hoo!

598
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:43,619
Are you ready to help rescue
that little young 'un?

599
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:46,856
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!

600
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:51,964
Luke! On your feet,
you lazy critter!

601
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:58,366
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin'
for someone to holler ''charge''!

602
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:02,400
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin'
and get a-goin'!

603
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:08,040
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up,
his nose gets plumb out of joint.

604
01:00:08,118 --> 01:00:09,710
Take it easy, Gramps.

605
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:13,051
We gotta stay here till Evinrude
brings us word from them mice.

606
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:15,648
If'n that bug don't get here soon...

607
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:19,491
they'll put that poor little girl
down the black hole again.

608
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:28,897
All right, you little brat. Now, you
are gonna go down in that hole...

609
01:00:28,972 --> 01:00:31,668
and you are gonna dig
till you find me the diamond.

610
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:34,335
You understand that?
And no sassing me.

611
01:00:34,411 --> 01:00:38,404
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops,
that is no way to speak...

612
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:41,917
to our little Miss Penny.

613
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:44,579
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.

614
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:47,054
Now, my dear...

615
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:50,422
you are going to find
the big, shiny diamond...

616
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,018
for your Auntie Medusa.

617
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,257
Aren't you?

618
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:57,492
Teddy doesn't like it down there.

619
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,502
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?

620
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:04,097
Ah. Poor Teddy.

621
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:08,167
I'll just keep him up here with me,
where he'll be safe.

622
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:10,235
Give me back my teddy bear!

623
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,747
He's mine! He's mine!

624
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,586
You get down there
and find the big diamond...

625
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:25,094
or you will never see
that Teddy again!

626
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:29,097
All right, all right.

627
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:30,860
I'll go.

628
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:33,095
Boss, you've really
got a way with kids.

629
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:39,201
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.

630
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:41,436
I'll find her old diamond.

631
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:59,855
Oh, what a dreadful,
frightening place.

632
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:02,557
Yeah, it used to be
a pirates' cave.

633
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,226
How do you know that, Penny?

634
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:09,362
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!

635
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:12,670
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for
that diamond so we can get out of here.

636
01:02:12,742 --> 01:02:14,437
Oh, I looked there already.

637
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:17,071
Medusa doesn't want
those little ones.

638
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:23,948
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?

639
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:30,423
That's where the water comes in.

640
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:33,121
I'm afraid to go over there.

641
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:36,029
Well, if I was a pirate...

642
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:38,533
that's just where I'd hide
the Devil's Eye.

643
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:43,300
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.

644
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:58,783
Uh, come--
c-come to think of it...

645
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:03,019
if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.

646
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:04,821
Bernard, look!

647
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:08,193
I can see something.
Come on.

648
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:11,131
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.

649
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:12,998
You-- You stay here.

650
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:17,472
I'll see if I can find
a safe way over.

651
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:32,179
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!

652
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:34,723
- Help!
- I'm coming!

653
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:42,161
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.

654
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:44,826
Well, look faster.

655
01:04:12,428 --> 01:04:14,487
Wow!

656
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:21,095
P-Penny, hold--
hold your lantern up again.

657
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:29,108
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.

658
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:33,410
Penny, we found it!
We found it!

659
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:36,577
Medusa, I found it!

660
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,883
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!

661
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:41,389
Back! Ah, good girl.

662
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,925
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.

663
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:15,152
Look, it won't go through.

664
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,918
I can't get it out.

665
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:22,795
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.

666
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:24,924
Stuck tight?

667
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:29,529
You get that diamond,
or you'll never see daylight again!

668
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:34,307
No, no, back! Back, Penny!

669
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:37,346
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!

670
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:59,898
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.

671
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:09,503
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.

672
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:13,242
Not until you get the diamond.

673
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,046
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.

674
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:50,509
Penny! Penny, help!

675
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:09,701
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!

676
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,040
Faster, Snoops. Faster.

677
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:16,442
Pulling as fast as I can.

678
01:07:16,512 --> 01:07:19,106
At last!

679
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:21,776
The Devil's Eye!

680
01:07:26,022 --> 01:07:28,582
It's worth millions!

681
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,150
Just look at it.

682
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:34,753
Filled with power...

683
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:36,822
for its owner.

684
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:39,163
Let me-- Let me look at it.

685
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,901
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.

686
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:47,170
But I know that there's enough there
to cut it into two equal shares.

687
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:51,839
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?

688
01:07:51,914 --> 01:07:56,578
And it's mine. It's all mine.

689
01:07:56,652 --> 01:08:00,281
All yours? Half of it is mine,
you double-crossing crook!

690
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:05,020
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!

691
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:08,325
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.

692
01:08:08,397 --> 01:08:11,696
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!

693
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:51,331
Land's sakes!

694
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:53,136
It's Evinrude!

695
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:55,871
Oh, well, sure is a mess.

696
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,140
Where in tarnation you been, boy?

697
01:08:58,214 --> 01:09:00,011
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?

698
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:02,073
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?

699
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:06,918
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be
quitting now, must we?

700
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:14,420
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!

701
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:16,590
He's plumb tuckered out.

702
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:20,363
Here, son, this'll make
a new bug out of you.

703
01:09:29,245 --> 01:09:31,770
Charge! Ya-hoo!

704
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:38,949
We're gonna have us
a rip-snortin' fight.

705
01:09:42,124 --> 01:09:46,083
Yee-hoo! Charge!

706
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:51,195
Where'd everybody go?

707
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,455
I don't need any help
from anybody!

708
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:25,125
Charge! Ya-hoo!

709
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:37,341
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!

710
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:40,678
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.

711
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:44,948
If either of you
try to follow me...

712
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,512
you'll get blasted!

713
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,684
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.

714
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:54,022
Teddy goes with me, my dear.

715
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:57,463
I've become quite attached...

716
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,023
to him.

717
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:08,206
My diamond!
My diamond!

718
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:19,487
Charge!

719
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:41,171
Now!

720
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:44,840
Now! Now!

721
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,250
Look out!

722
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:05,256
Oh, please start.

723
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:09,662
Advance the spark.

724
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:12,003
Not the horn, the spark lever.

725
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:14,508
Digger, hold this.

726
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,670
It's that doohickey
on the steering wheel.

727
01:12:27,156 --> 01:12:29,090
You-- You...

728
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:31,524
and your infernal fireworks!

729
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:33,858
You-- You--

730
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:35,692
Oh, you dunderhead!

731
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,034
We're not getting any gas.

732
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:43,697
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!

733
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:29,250
Look out! The riverboat!

734
01:13:48,103 --> 01:13:51,163
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!

735
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,538
Bernard, you're wonderful!

736
01:13:53,609 --> 01:13:55,372
- We did it!
- We got her!

737
01:13:55,444 --> 01:13:58,140
We sure showed that Medusa!

738
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:01,307
There goes...

739
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,477
my diamond!

740
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:13,389
And because of a courageous
little girl named Penny...

741
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:16,329
the world's largest diamond,
the Devil's Eye...

742
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:19,162
is now in the Smithsonian Institute.

743
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,965
But what's even
more important, folks...

744
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:24,972
this little orphan's dream
has come true.

745
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,508
Today she's being adopted.

746
01:14:27,576 --> 01:14:30,545
-And here she is
with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow

747
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:33,844
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow

748
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:35,907
From Morningside Orphanage

749
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:39,580
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad

750
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:44,524
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.

751
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:46,754
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...

752
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:49,195
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage

753
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:51,529
You are a darling.

754
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,865
Penny,you were a brave little girl
to do what you did all by yourself.

755
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:57,735
Oh, I didn't do it
all by myself.

756
01:14:57,806 --> 01:15:02,209
Two little mice from
the Rescue Aid Society helped me.

757
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:05,543
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?

758
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:08,048
Yes, they rescued me.

759
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:11,553
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!

760
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,212
Hi, Bernard.!

761
01:15:13,289 --> 01:15:15,519
You can talk to these little mice?

762
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:18,219
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.

763
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:20,228
Didn't you know that?

764
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:23,891
Well, uh, I didn't,
but I do now, Penny.

765
01:15:31,974 --> 01:15:35,705
Evinrude, what are you doing here?

766
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,714
It's another call for help.

767
01:15:43,786 --> 01:15:45,879
Here, uh, uh...

768
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:48,423
you're gonna need some volunteers.

769
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:51,050
But-- B-But, B-Bianca,
we just--

770
01:15:51,126 --> 01:15:54,493
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills...

771
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:57,555
intrigue, travel, exotic places.

772
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,965
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.

773
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:15,411
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.

774
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:47,881
Tomorrow is another day

775
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:56,689
How I hope you'll always stay

776
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:04,227
Tomorrow is another day
