Your eminences,
we have a new Pope.

14
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:01,512
Do you,
most reverend Lord Cardinal,

15
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:05,647
accept your election
as supreme pontiff

16
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,217

Your Holiness.

27
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,300
You say that to me
every day, Francesco.

28
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,954
You find
a different way of saying it,

29
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,739
but basically,
the message is the same.

[Francesco laughs]

31
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,793
[Francesco] Your Holiness,
today we have a meeting

32
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:18,361
with members
of the Vatican Bank.

33
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,019
Seven groups for blessings,
three private audiences.

35
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,110

-Brazil.
-Yes, Brazil.

38
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,987
We have the Italian soccer team.

39
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,687
They're in the finals
of the world cup against Brazil.

40
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,516
Is it all right if I bless them,

41
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,474
or would that set off
an international incident?

42
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:45,606

and a monsoon flood
in the Philippines

46

52
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:16,506
Also, two missionaries
were killed in Guatemala.

53
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,726
We are trying
to get the details,

54
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,945
but apparently government troops

55
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,035
have destroyed the villages
they were working in.

56
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:28,605
We are preparing a statement
and setting up a fund

57
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:29,998
for the families.

58
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:35,482
I will write
the statement. Myself.

-Hmm?

The doctors say
he will die soon.

74
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,513
Paolo, do you know
that God thinks

-about you every day?
-You are the Pope.

76
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:57,477

Tell him to send a miracle.

-Well...
-He's going to be better?

80
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,279
I can't...
I can't make a miracle.

81
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,763
I can only pray for one.
We'll both pray, hmm?

82
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:27,855
But you're God's chosen.
Why can't you make a miracle?

83
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,647
-Your Holiness...
-Francesco, could you think

84
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,649
of something to call me
other than "Your Holiness."

85
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,956
My Holiness, everyone else
calls you "Your Holiness."

86
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,959
Yes, but they don't address me
fifty times a day.

-Thank you.

Ah, yes.

92
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,898
The Vatican Bank is attracting
too few depositors.

93
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:15,772
We feel the situation
might be improved

94
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,253
by offering certain enticements.

95

Your Holiness.

Medium-level depositors,

-No.

111
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,264
No, it's got to be more humble.

112
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:16,398
-Your Humbleness.
-That's ridiculous.

113
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,227
He's the Holy Father.
What should I call him?

Uh. Sorry to... to interrupt.

I think,
it's perfectly reasonable.

Why don't we give them
what they want.

00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,574
I bring greetings
from my government,

177
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:44,361
and respectfully request
that your priests cease

178
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,147
their subversive activities
within my country.

179
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:51,542
Otherwise, I cannot be
responsible for their safety.

180
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,206
But you are responsible.
I believe, ultimately,

181
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,644
we're all responsible
for each other. Hmm?

182
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,125
I'll remember you in my prayers.

185
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:41,157
Well, it's been
a hard year, Leo.

186
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,292
But you survived it well.

187
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,992
Stefano, don't tell me
I've survived it well.

188
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,124
Don't tell me that.

189
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,607
I'm completely out of touch
with how most people live.

190
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,526
I sometimes wonder
if anything I say or do

191
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,702
has any effect
outside these walls.

192
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,316
That isn't for you
to decide, Leo.

193
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,712
You are loved
and respected by millions.

194
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:20,370
You've done all
that you've been asked to do.

195

[Leo] When I was a priest,

196
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,599
I could see
the results of my work.

197
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:36,560
Now I'm a Pope... [chuckles]
...but I'm no longer a priest.

198
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,042
It's not possible to be both.

Pope Paul X,

of the modern popes.

Let's face it, the Pope's just
a mascot for the church.

put a bunny costume on him.

00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:26,400
or...

346
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,797
or if I'm being compelled
by God...

347
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,151
to do something
that he wants me to do.

348
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,461
And, uh...

349
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,291
I'm looking
for... for some guidance.

-Sorry. This road is closed.

361
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,451
But I have to get
to the village.

362
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:46,018
You can't.
The village is quarantined.

363
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:48,020
There's an epidemic.
People are dying.

my friend?

367
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,164
How are things at the ministry?

00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,253

-Oh, that's good.

-Fine. Just fine.

370

You don't remember me, huh?

388

No? All right.

389
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:53,814
I had a large cross here,
no beard.

390
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:58,819
[chuckles] Hello.

391
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,300
You're beautiful.

392
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:12,528
I came
to see you and your village.

393
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:16,489
Huh? Is this your house?

394
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,146
Ah, I... I see.

395
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:28,849
Don't tell anyone about me.
Mm-hmm?

396
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:32,635
It's a se... [shushes]
...secret between just us.

397
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,596
-Yes? I have nowhere...
-[coughs]

398
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:42,080
...to sleep in the village.
Do you know some?

399
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:46,388
Yes. All right.

400
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:53,178
Not your sister, no? Yes.

401
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:59,358
[Lucia] Excuse the dust,
but... [sighs]

402
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:02,404
...business isn't too good
during an epidemic.

403
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,668
[Leo] No, it's... it's, uh,
it's very nice,

404
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,497
I'm very grateful. Thank you.
Thank you, Isabella.

405
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,457
Hmm, how do you know her name?

406
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,373
Uh, she showed me her medallion.

407
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:15,504
Ah.

408
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,378
And, uh, how did you
get into the village?

409
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:22,120
Oh, I, uh,
I... I walked up the hill.

410
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,252
I... I didn't know
there was an epidemic.

-[dogs barking]
-Oh.

412
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:27,864
And?

413
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,520
What? Sorry.

414
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:33,914
I... I would like to know
a little bit more about you.

415
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,569
Yes, anything-- What...
what would you like to know?

416
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:38,571
Your name.

417
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:42,879
Ah! I should have it written
on my medallion. [chuckles]

418
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,447
Well, what is it?

419
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,320
-It's a cross.
-[Lucia] No. I mean your name.

420
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:49,930
It's Francesco.

421
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:54,587
-Yes. Francesco...
-Biondi.

422
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:58,939
-Francesco Biondi.
-Francesco Biondi.

423
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,944
Do I know you?
You look familiar.

424
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:08,340
I don't think so, no. [chuckles]

425
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,430
Some people say that I look
like the Pope. [chuckles]

426
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:16,652
[Lucia] Well,
Isabella seems to trust you.

427
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:20,787
I'll show you your room,
it's right over here.

428
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:21,962
Thank you.

429
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:33,930
[dishes clatter]

430
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,845
[Francesco] We won't need you
to serve now.

431
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,893
Thank you.
And please shut the door.

432

[clears throat]

433
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,211
What's he having today?

434
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,213
-Calf's liver.
-Oh, no.

435
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:57,737
-Always has it on Wednesday.
-[sighs]

436
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,260
I can't stand calf's liver.

437
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,437
Maybe that's why
you are not the Pope.

What is this?

444
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:32,805
Hey! Hey. Put this down!
What! Hey...

445
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,114
-Ah! Who is there?
-[footsteps approaching]

446
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:47,907
What are you doing?

447
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:50,475
Huh?

448
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,174
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

449
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:59,092
-I asked you first. Who are you?
-Oh, God.

450
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,052
-[Giuliano] Are you the police?
-No.

451
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:07,056
Police are looking for me.
Hundreds of them.

452
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:08,971
But they will never catch
Giuliano.

453
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,975
-Are these your boys?
-Yes.

454
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,065
Mm. Not very many.

455
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:20,113
-I have more.
-That's good. That's good.

456
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,123
-Real gold?
-Yes.

457
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,560
If it was real gold,

458
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:33,779
why don't you care
that I took it?

459
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,781
All right, then. Don't take it.

460
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,784
-Maybe he's a priest.
-No.

461
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:42,048
A priest would be telling us
we go to hell for this.

462
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:44,659
-If I were you...
-[grunts]

463
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:46,182
...I'd leave Montepetra.

464
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:49,708
It's not such a good place
for strangers.

465
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,498
Giuliano...

466
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:07,116
the cross is worth money.
Don't squander it. Keep it.

467
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,989
One day you may need it
for something important.

[indistinct chatter]

481
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,561
I just found out
about the epidemic.

482
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,214
[Lucia] Oh?

483
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,741
Yes, um, from one of the dead,
as a matter of fact.

484
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:01,666
There was a real one here.
Three years ago.

485
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:05,887
The health ministry came in
and quarantined the town.

486
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:09,195
And then they brought in food.

487
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,242
The men liked it so much,
they decided to do it again.

488
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:15,375
How do they get the marks
on their faces?

489
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:19,858
You rub an herb on your face.
It makes a nice welt.

490
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:23,818
You ought to be leaving then.

491
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,212
No. I, um, I thought

492
00:43:26,342 --> 00:43:28,083
I would try to find some work
in the village.

493
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:32,305
No work in Montepetra.
The men go over to Rigio.

494
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:35,221
Ones who aren't pretending
to be sick anyway.

495
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:37,702
Yes, I thought I would go
with them in the morning.

496
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:41,967
-[scoffs] You won't like it.
-Maybe not.

497
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,840
I'll have Isabella
wake you in the morning

498
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:48,408

-He's in the south.
-Whereabouts?

512
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:46,047
Are you all right?

513
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:47,745
Yes, yes, I'm... I'm fine.

514
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,529
I'm just a little tired
from working.

Work? You got a job?

00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:57,189
Well, it's not...
it's not exactly a job.

517
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:01,106
Um, I... I sort rags
with the villagers.

518

-He's sorting rags.
-Rags?

519
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:08,896
Your Holiness,
with all due respect.

520
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,204
Can't these people sort
their own rags?

521
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:17,252
Well, yes, yes, they could,
but, uh...

Your Holiness,
when are you coming back?

526
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,485
No. I, well, I don't know
When... when I'm coming back.

527
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:35,401

to do something here.

529
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:41,233

530
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:43,365
that you are
on a two-week retreat.

531
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:47,456
What can we do
if you're not back in time?

532
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,285
Well, you'll think of something.

533

complete confidence in you.

-What is it?

537

I can see
why you wanted somebody to come.

544
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:40,205
I feel rather inadequate,
to tell the truth,

545
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:43,991
because there is rather
a lot to do.

546
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:50,563
I'm not sure where to begin.
In fact...

547
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:55,220

I could do with some help.

I never thought of that.

560
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,733
No. No,
they... they didn't fire me.

561
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:16,301
-Maybe God did.
-[sheep bleating]

562
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:19,434
I can put your mind
to rest with that.

563
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:23,134
There's no such person.

[bells dinging]

565
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:42,066
What happened
to the aqueduct?

566
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:49,073
[scoffs] Earthquake.
Half the village went with it.

567
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:51,597
[Leo] Why was it never rebuilt?

568
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,731
-For that you need the money...
-[sheep bleating]

569

-...and the will.
-Hmm.

570

The money was taken
by the priests.

Why should I break my back
for nothing

589
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:23,983
when I can take it easy
and still get nothing?

590

it will come to nothing?

-Mm... well...
-[sheep bleating]

594

Where exactly
do your interests lie?

596
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:00,802
Your profession
doesn't allow you to understand.

597
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,414
-My profession?
-Mm-hmm.

598
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:06,808
What is my profession?
Tell me. What is my profession?

599
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:08,245
Your profession--
You're the Pope.

600
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,942
-Mm.
-[mumbles]

601
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:12,379
Yes, and of course you have
exactly your idea

602
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,946
of what the Pope is,

603
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:15,991
because it's impossible
for you to realize

604
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:18,255
that a Pope can be anything.

605
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:21,823
He can even be a-- Like a tramp
who comes to a deserted village

606
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:23,738
to help some neglected people.

607
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,871
Yes. That's exactly
what I expect the Pope to be.

608
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:28,395
In whatever way,

609
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:31,790
the practice is the same,
hmm?

610
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,574

Could I... could I just
talk to you for a second?

615
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:05,954
I was, um...
I was looking at the aqueduct.

616
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:08,479
Uh, I think it could be rebuilt.

617
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:11,612
I think you could get some water
back into the hills.

618
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,788
Better than to go into Rigio
to work in the dump.

619
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,574
Yes, but how?

620
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:19,011
Well, you know there's, uh,

621
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:20,839
there's a lot
of timber down there

622
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:22,841
just lying around.
Um, the trough is broken.

623
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:25,409
There are holes you know.
There is wood in the village

624
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:27,976
and I think, we have find enough
to repair the trough.

625
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,674
-Do you understand?
-[Leo] Well, we...

626
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:31,066
we can find a way
to turn the wheel.

627
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,765
Sure, very good idea.
Thank you very much.

636
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,813
I already sold
your stinking cross.

637
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,858
It wasn't even real gold.

638
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:26,818
The guy that sold it to you
took you for a ride.

639
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,820
I didn't come about the cross.

640
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,865
You do anything to me,
my men will hunt you down

641

and kill you like a dog.

642
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:39,091
It's a terrifying prospect.

643
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:41,572
No, not those guys.
Those guys are worthless.

644
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:43,051
Some other guys.

645
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:44,575
You told me
about the other guys.

646
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:50,929
I'll make a deal with you.
If you call off the other guys,

647
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:55,586
I'll let you work with me
for one whole week.

648
00:56:56,325 --> 00:57:00,068
-What kind of a deal is that?
-Terrible. It's a terrible deal.

649
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:02,984
No, I-- For you I admit,
it's... it's not good.

650
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:08,947
Look, you have all these guys.
I have nobody at all.

651
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,037

you wouldn't mind

652
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,778
giving me a hand.

653
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:15,736
And that thing
you're going to build?

654
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:17,695
Do you know the whole village
is laughing at you.

655
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:20,045
It's going to be
an irrigation system.

656
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:23,004
You get to mix cement,
you could do some digging--

657
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:25,006
I don't do that kind of stuff.

658
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:27,531
Oh, but I would teach you.
I think you could be good at it.

659
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:30,534
You can execute me right here.
I'm not gonna do no digging.

660
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,016
But, Giuliano,
you owe me a favor.

661
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:37,715
What favor?

What makes you think
I'm going to show up?

664
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,943
-I'll take your word for it.
-I didn't give you my word.

665
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:51,903
I'll take it anyway.
I'll see you in the morning.

666
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,037
You can keep the cross,
Giuliano.

667
00:57:56,777 --> 00:58:00,738
I give it to you with pleasure.
Bring the pulleys.

00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,977
He said two
were better than one.

687
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:08,675
Well, that wasn't the agreement.

688
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,590
-Okay, I'll go tell him.
-Uh-uh-uh.

689
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:11,809
After you work, huh?

[boy] Ciolino, look.
It's Giuliano's guys.

693
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:53,590
Hey, this mean trouble.

696
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:13,914
Excuse me.
I need to clean the room.

697
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:15,742
Oh, do you want me to leave?

698
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:17,701
[Lucia] That's all right.
May I come in?

699
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:19,137
-Oh, yes.
-[Lucia] Thank you.

-[Lucia] Thank you.
-Thank you.

703
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:06,853
-[Giuliano] I can't do it.
-[Ciolino] Yes, you can.

704
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:10,074
That bald guy right there.
Okay, go on.

705
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:11,728
I'm not going to school.

706
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:13,120
-Don't do this.
-I'm not going to go...

707
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,905
-Let's go.
-No, no.

708
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:16,863
-I'm not going to go--
-I told your mother

709
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:18,256
-you're going to school.
-I'm not going to go to school.

710
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:19,736
-No.
-Let's go.

711
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:21,215
-No.
-Don't make me get mad.

712
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:23,174
-No, I'm not going to.
-I'll take that.

713
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,958
I'm going to do it, right here,
in front of everybody.

714
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:26,743
-Come here. Come here.
-Don't do it.

715
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:28,005
-Come here.
-[Giuliano] Don't do it.

716
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:29,310
I said come here.

717
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:31,051
-Come here.
-[man] Get away.

718
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:31,965

-[Giuliano] Stop!
-[Ciolino] Where's the wallet?

No money in the wallet!

[Lucia] No.

743
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,103
You've caused
nothing but problems.

-Yes, I think so.

01:03:57,311 --> 01:04:00,314
Are you all right? [pants] Huh?

758
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:02,142
How can I possibly
be all right?

759

-[chuckles softly]
-He punched me five times,

760
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:05,189
he kicked me seven times.

-I'm in a very bad--
-I'm not joking.

-Are you all right? [laughs]
-[laughs, pants]

763
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:20,117
Let me see.

[sighs]

765
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,083
-No, it's not really, uh...
-It is.

766
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,533
Why do you stay in Montepetra?

767
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:49,537
-[scoffs] This is my home.
-Hmm.

768
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:52,105
Did you ever live
anywhere else?

01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:53,280
Yes.

770
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:56,283
-Where?
-Naples.

771
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:59,417
I went there
after Vittorio died.

772
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:02,463
Isabella was three years old,
and I was alone.

773
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:04,335
And I saw a notice in the paper

774
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,511
about jobs for girls
in the canning factory.

775
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:09,383
So, this was a chance
to change my life, eh?

776
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,169
So, I took Isabella,
and I went there,

777
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:14,649
but, uh, there were no jobs.

778
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:17,043
Hundreds of girls just like me

779
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:18,523
-but no jobs.
-Hmm.

780
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:21,569
They often do that
to keep the wages down.

781
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,007
I see.

782
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:26,705
I'm sorry to be
boring you with all this.

783
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:29,055
No, no, no.
You're not boring me.

784
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:30,143
What happened?

785
01:05:32,189 --> 01:05:33,233
Nothing.

786
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,540
I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't pry.

787
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,976
No, I mean, I just...

788
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,066
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.

789
01:05:40,197 --> 01:05:41,676
-All right, it's all right.
-[chuckles]

790
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,375
-What happened?
-Well, we didn't have money

791
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:46,420
to eat or to come home, so...

792
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,683
Did you have somewhere to live?

793
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:51,208
Well, I found a place, yes.

794
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:52,644
There was this man
who came to us--

795
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,559
Who said he had a place,
but... [scoffs]

-[breathes deeply]
-[groans]

797
01:05:58,302 --> 01:05:59,259
Sorry.

798
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:03,742
[chuckles softly] What?

799
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,010
Well...

800
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:15,101
there was nothing else.

801
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:29,986
[somber music concludes]

802
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:33,598

[boy 1] Oh, my God.

807
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:53,009
[boy 2] What are we going to do?

808
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:54,445
[Leo] Stay back. Stay back.

809
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:56,099
[boy 2] Can we stop it?

810
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:00,277
[indistinct clamor]

[fire crackling]

812
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:17,250
What happened?

813
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,166
Some men from Ciolino.

814
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:21,646
[sheep bleating]

815
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,257
Did you see them?

816
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:27,695
-Yes.
-[sheep bleating]

817
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,132
You tried to stop them?

818
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:34,441
[sighs] What could I do?

819
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:38,271
Besides,
it's none of my business.

820
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:40,708
[sheep bleating]

821
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,406
It's going to be your business

822
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:44,712
if your house burns down!

823
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,672
[sheep bleating]

824
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:57,682
Why would they do this?

825
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,031
[Lucia]
This is Ciolino's village.

826
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:00,206
He doesn't want you here.

827
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:04,863
Well, I'll build it again.

828
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:06,125
Like they'll come,
and burn it again.

829
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:07,431
So, I'll build it again.

830
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:08,780
And when they come back,
I'll be here,

831
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,173
I'll be waiting for them.

01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,483
I'm sorry. I woke you.

835
01:09:05,706 --> 01:09:06,533
Ah, Lucia.

836
01:09:07,752 --> 01:09:09,754
I just wanted
to be close to you.

837
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:12,670
Oh, Lucia.

838
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:24,247
Lucia.

839
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:27,380
[smacks lips]

840
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:28,860
I...

841
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:32,603
-I'm in love.
-No.

842
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:34,387
-No, I--
-No.

843
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:36,172
No, but I have to...
to explain to you

844
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:38,435
that I want you
to be here with me.

845
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:40,785
Then I'll be here with you.

846
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,832
-I wanted to be here with you.
-But--

847
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:46,443
But for a reason that--

848
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:49,794
That you'll understand later.

849
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,796
-[sighs]
-It's impossible.

850
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:52,927
Don't.

851
01:09:58,933 --> 01:09:59,804
It's all right.

852
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:04,852
But it's...
it's very important that...

853
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:09,857
that you understand
that I want you to be here.

854
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:16,995
[sighs] It would have been
very awkward anyway.

855
01:10:19,476 --> 01:10:20,651
[Leo] Hmm, Lucia.

856
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:23,567
[Lucia] Don't be sorry.

857
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,397
I'll say good night now.

858
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,356
I'll see you in the morning.

859
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:35,927
May God bless you, Lucia.

860
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:57,992
[dramatic music concludes]

861
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:02,736
-[birds chirping]
-[indistinct chatter]

862
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:07,437
I, uh, I thought that maybe
you could use some supplies

863
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,787
if you're going to be staying
down at the aqueduct.

864
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:10,918
Oh.

865
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:14,052
So, I put them on the--

866
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:17,751
-To prepare.
-That's very kind of you.

867
01:11:18,665 --> 01:11:20,754
Thank you. That's, uh,
that's a lot of stuff.

868
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:23,844
-I... I didn't realize, I--
-I would like to help you,

869
01:11:23,975 --> 01:11:26,325
But if that would embarrass you,
of course, I won't.

870
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:28,284
Why...
why should I feel embarrassed?

871
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:30,547
Well, the men here,
they don't like to work

872
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:32,418
-with women.
-[hammer thudding]

873
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:33,593
Oh. No, well,

874
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:36,422
for me, it would be a pleasure.

875
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:38,511
-Good.
-[chuckles]

876
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:44,561
[girl] Good morning.

877
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,607
We come to work with you.

878
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:51,350
-Didn't know already.
-[chuckles]

879
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:54,701
[joyful music playing]

880
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,314
[tools clattering]

881
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:04,668
[hammer thudding]

882
01:12:22,947 --> 01:12:25,036
Hey! Tonino, look who's coming.

883
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:33,610
-How you doing?
-Eh. Hello.

884
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:36,700
I want you to meet Bianca.

885
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,355
-How do you do, Bianca?
-Hello.

886
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:42,488
So, Giuliano,
where have you been?

887
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,142
Boy,
I've been getting you some boys.

888
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:46,318
It's pitiful for a man like you

889
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,928
working with a bunch
of little girls.

890
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,669
You want everybody
laughing at you?

891
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:51,889
I think they're already laughing
at me.

892
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:53,325
[Giuliano]
You had enough laughing.

893
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:54,892
No. It doesn't matter.

894
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:57,503
So, where did you get
all these boys?

895
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:59,549
Eh, I got Franco
his first woman,

896
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:04,380
I got Fabio out of trouble,
and I beat up a guy for Stefan.

897
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:07,034
I know-- I'm... I'm beginning
to understand.

898
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:09,776
-How are these guys doing?
-[Leo] They're, uh,

899
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:11,865
they're fine. They're, uh,
they're working very hard.

900
01:13:11,996 --> 01:13:13,650
They give you any trouble,
you let me know.

901
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:14,955
Oh.

902
01:13:15,826 --> 01:13:17,175
Thank you, Giuliano,

903
01:13:17,305 --> 01:13:18,132
for everything
that you're doing.

904
01:13:18,263 --> 01:13:19,395
No, it's okay.

905
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:28,839
-Hold this for a moment, please.
-Oh, sure, yeah.

906
01:13:30,797 --> 01:13:33,539
Uh. Why don't you get yourself
a cup of coffee?

907
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:35,846
We have some business
to talk about.

908
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:39,763
Okay.

909
01:13:44,115 --> 01:13:48,075
Very good. All right, Giuliano.
Now, see what we're doing?

910
01:13:48,206 --> 01:13:49,860
We're putting up these posts

911
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:52,950
because we have to reconstruct
all of this.

912
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:59,652
[telephone ringing]

913
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:02,568
-Hello.
-[Leo] <i>Hello, Stefano.</i>

914
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:04,178
Your Holiness.

915
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:05,963
Your Holiness,

916
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:08,618
are you on your way back?

917
01:14:08,748 --> 01:14:11,229
No, no, no, not yet, um,

918
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:13,100
I called to tell you
that... that, uh,

919
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:14,928
I could be here
for some time yet.

920
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:16,452
Longer than two weeks?

921
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:18,062
[Leo] <i>Stefano, listen carefully.</i>

922
01:14:18,192 --> 01:14:20,238
I'm helping the village

923
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:23,763
to rebuild
the irrigation system.

924
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,983
Do you know
how to do such a thing?

925
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,681
No, Stefan,
I don't as a matter of fact

926
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:29,987
but I'm learning.

927
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,119
We can send
everything they need.

928
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:37,473
Engineers, materials,
we can build it for them.

929
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,997
These are defeated people.
Hmm.

930
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:42,521
It would fall into disuse
in a couple of weeks.

931
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:44,218
They have to do it themselves.

932
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:47,787
But this could take months.

933
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:51,269
Well... [inhales deeply]
...anyway, Stefano, it, uh,

934
01:14:52,139 --> 01:14:53,924
it may be some time yet.

935
01:14:54,054 --> 01:14:57,623
Holiness,
Cardinals are restless,

936
01:14:59,059 --> 01:15:01,235
And the press
is trying to bribe the staff

937
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:02,759
for information.

938
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:06,284
Stefano,
I will be back sometime.

939
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:09,287
-Good-bye.
-Hmm.

940
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:11,768
Good-bye, Holiness.

941
01:15:18,992 --> 01:15:20,951
So, why do you work
for this guy?

942
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,127
I lost a bet with him.

943
01:15:25,912 --> 01:15:27,261
So, he's not even from here.

944
01:15:27,392 --> 01:15:29,133
Why do you have to be
honest with him?

945
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:30,961
I'm an honorable man.

946
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:32,876
[clicks tongue]

947
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:37,924
Don't get wise with me,
you little shit.

948
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:42,668
You were nothing
when I found you.

949
01:15:44,235 --> 01:15:45,845
You go on working or this guy,

950
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:47,586
I'm going to cut you off,
you understand?

951
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:51,634
No more pretty girls,
no more fancy suits.

952
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:55,812
Go on, work for slave labor.
See what you get.

953
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:58,858
-At least I work.
-[chair scraping]

954
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:03,210
You're going to starve to death,
you bastard.

955

[foreboding music playing]

956
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,654
[firecracker sparks]

01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:09,973
[dog barking in distance]

958
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:22,028
[Giuliano] Who's there?

959
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:29,688
-Is the bombardment over?
-What are you doing here?

960
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:33,170
I just came to say hello.

961
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,390
So, hello.

962
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,828
Come in. Sit down.

963
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:40,786
Thank you.

964
01:17:43,354 --> 01:17:47,140
[coughs, exhales]

965
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,321
Where did you get the fireworks?

966
01:17:54,452 --> 01:17:55,453
I bought 'em.

967
01:17:56,454 --> 01:17:57,803
Did I say you didn't?

968
01:17:58,935 --> 01:18:00,240
I have all different kinds.

969
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:03,374
Mandarin ducks, bantam phantoms.

970
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:05,463
Bantam phantoms.

971
01:18:05,593 --> 01:18:07,160
Yeah, and it comes
festival time,

972
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,032
-I sell them to all the towns.
-Yeah.

973
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:11,774
But that's nothing. How's this?

974
01:18:13,123 --> 01:18:14,472
[Leo] Wonderful.

975
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,127
I'm the only one
in Montepetra with a TV.

976
01:18:17,257 --> 01:18:19,956
Ah, you have electricity here.

977
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,827
Nope.

978
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:24,830
It must be
rather difficult to watch.

979
01:18:25,613 --> 01:18:28,878
-Yeah, sometimes.
-[chuckles] Sometimes.

980
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:32,708
It's a confessional
from the church?

981
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:34,448
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

982
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,845
Who is the...
the man in the picture?

983
01:18:40,977 --> 01:18:41,934
Somebody.

984
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:44,937
Hmm.

985
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:50,116
What happened
to your mother and father?

986
01:18:51,988 --> 01:18:53,119
Something. I don't know.

987
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:55,861
Hmm.

988
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:59,343
I didn't ever know
my mother and father.

989
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:02,868
I was... I was brought up
in an orphanage, you know.

990
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:07,046
The nuns found me
and they took me in. I--

991
01:19:07,177 --> 01:19:09,135
They said the biggest mistake
they ever made

992
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:10,833
was to take me in. [chuckles]

993
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:12,312
[chuckles]

994
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:16,229
I was in one
of those places, too.

995
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,536
My father,
he couldn't take care of me.

996
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:21,408
He always doing
a lot of traveling,

997
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:23,323
so he dropped me off there.

998
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:24,977
What happened to your mother?

999
01:19:27,197 --> 01:19:28,546
She died when I was born.

1000
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:31,505
Ah.

1001
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:37,903
Some of us, you know,
are... are sleeping out

1002
01:19:38,034 --> 01:19:39,818
by the... by the water wheel.

1003
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,038
And...

1004
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:45,781
we could do with some
new conversation out there.

1005
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:48,261
Why... why don't you come
and stay there

1006
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:49,393
for a few nights?

1007
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:51,830
Yeah, maybe.

1008
01:19:51,961 --> 01:19:53,266
Whatever you think.

1009
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,270
[tools clattering]

1010
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:59,142
See how well
your boys are doing?

1011
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:01,405
When my boys do something,
they do it good.

1012
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:05,931
[Leo] Let me pass. Let me pass.

1013
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:07,063
[sighs]

1014
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,460
Look. Look, look. Giuliano.

1015
01:20:14,026 --> 01:20:16,072
[boy] Hey, guys,
look who's here.

1016
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:20,206
Did you bring your matches?

1017
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,557
[crow cawing]

[suspenseful music playing]

1019
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:34,220
[Fabio] This thing
is going to work?

1020
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:35,395
[Franco] I know it's gonna work.

1021
01:20:35,526 --> 01:20:37,136
[Fabio] Good.

1022
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:38,355
[Franco] Just put it down tight.
Hold tight, okay?

1023
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:39,399
[Fabio] All right.

1024
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:49,366
[wind rustling]

1025
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:54,284
[Fabio]
Back up a little further.

1026
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:55,502
[Franco] All right.

1027
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:58,375
[Fabio]
Don't worry, don't worry.

1028
01:21:02,553 --> 01:21:04,424
[Fabio] Are you sure
about this?

1029
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:05,991
[Franco] Yeah. Put it down.

1030
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:27,578

1042
01:22:40,346 --> 01:22:43,001
I repeat,
his condition is not serious.

1043
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:45,743
And there is absolutely
no cause for alarm.

1044
01:22:46,657 --> 01:22:50,008
I'll continue to make
His Holiness' announcements

1045
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:51,749
until such time
as he's recovered

1046
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:53,751
from his influenza. Thank you.

1047
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:55,361

that might be?

1048
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:57,146
I can't say.

1049
01:22:57,276 --> 01:22:59,626
First he was indisposed,
then he had a cold.

1050
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:01,715
Now, it's influenza.
It's getting worse.

[Francesco]
As I already told you,

1052
01:23:03,804 --> 01:23:06,633
His Holiness is restricted
to bed for the time being.

1053
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:07,678
Thank you.

1054
01:23:08,287 --> 01:23:10,115
Is it true
that heart specialists

No more free food!

1061

It's over.

1062
01:23:44,106 --> 01:23:45,498
What are you talking about?

1063
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:48,458
They took down the roadblock.

1064
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:53,637
Somebody talked.

What do you want?

1067
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,758
You stay out of this.

1068
01:24:27,975 --> 01:24:29,151
You've caused
enough problems already.

All of you, get down!

1071
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:39,552
Why should they get down?

1072
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:41,598
Because we're going to burn it.

1073
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:44,122
No.

1074
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,256
No, you're not going to burn
something which can be

1075
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:49,084
of benefit to these people,

1076
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:51,216
and have them go back
to garbage dump.

1077
01:24:51,347 --> 01:24:52,696
Tell the women to get down.

1078
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:54,698

They are not going to come down.

for the whole world.

to face before...

of someone that I loved.

What about Stefan VII?

1129
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:08,218
He ordered the body
of his predecessor Formosus

to be exhumed,
clad in papal robes,

1131

and put on trial.

1132

01:32:20,186 --> 01:32:21,840
In history,
there's always someone

1134
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:23,363
who got there first.

[breathes deeply] So?

1137
01:32:29,413 --> 01:32:31,023
The point I'm trying to make is,

1138
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:32,938
compared with these
other people,

1139
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:34,984
our Pope Leo is a very sane man.

1140
01:32:35,898 --> 01:32:37,029
I think he'll come back.

1141
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:39,641
Perhaps.

1142
01:32:40,424 --> 01:32:42,165
But I have things to do.

1143
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:43,645

build this water trestle...

01:34:32,492 --> 01:34:35,757
and wondering
if you ever considered

1170
01:34:35,887 --> 01:34:37,933
how you were going
to turn the water wheel?

1171
01:34:42,067 --> 01:34:44,374
Well, yes, as a matter
of fact, I have, um...

1172
01:34:47,072 --> 01:34:49,118
I have considered that. Yes.

1173

Huh.

1174
01:34:51,947 --> 01:34:53,426

I have... I have faith

how to turn your water wheel.

I was fired.

approach the same hell.

you should be in there.

I'm more happy
than I can express

1284

that I can spend it with you.

1285
01:47:41,019 --> 01:47:44,588
I must thank all of you
who have written letters

of sympathy

1287

who wear this hat.

So, I must ask
your forgiveness...

1293
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:12,137
and tell you that...

1294
01:48:14,096 --> 01:48:18,579
I was not confined to bed
with influenza...

1295
01:48:20,015 --> 01:48:22,060
as was generally supposed.

1296
01:48:24,628 --> 01:48:25,629
Instead...

1297
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:28,763
I was in the middle

1298
01:48:29,981 --> 01:48:32,201
of an extraordinary adventure.

1299
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:37,815

1305

he became increasingly
depressed and alone.

1306
01:49:01,926 --> 01:49:05,626

to know the people

1307
01:49:06,061 --> 01:49:07,976
who looked to him for guidance.
