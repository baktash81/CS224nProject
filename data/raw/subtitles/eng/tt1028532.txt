1
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:20,905
<i>So, even if Columbus got lost and
wasn't the first to discover America,</i>

2
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,782
he is still my hero.

3
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:27,370
He was really brave to sail his
tiny ship over a really big ocean.

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,081
And because of him, we get
Columbus day off from school.

5
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:35,837
Thank you, Heather. Ronnie?

6
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:37,922
Tell us about your hero.

7
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,020
What is he writing?

8
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,983
Hachiko was my grandfather
Wilson's dog.

9
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,155
Everyone called Hachi a mystery
dog because,

10
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:05,658
they never really knew
where he came from.

11
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,746
Maybe Hachi escaped from
a dog pound.

12
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:14,208
Or maybe he jumped out of
somebody's car,

13
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,919
from some place faraway like
Florida or New Jersey.

14
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:24,009
But no matter how, Hachi was lost.

15
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,516
No matter how it happened,

16
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:58,770
a long time ago, in a town my
grandfather lived in...

17
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,815
Hachi appeared at the train station.

18
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,235
And that's where their story begin.

19
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,981
<i>Six days?</i>

20
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,608
- I'll miss it.
- Yes.

21
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,902
<i>That was great, a lot of music.</i>

22
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:50,488
<i>No, no, no, I'll walk. I'll walk.</i>

23
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,533
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

24
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:00,081
Hey, buddy... you lost?

25
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,166
Come here.

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,835
Come ...

27
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,756
You lost here, bud?

28
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,510
Someone must be looking for you.

29
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,392
This guy was wandering around.

30
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,560
<i>- Really... out on the platform?</i>
- On the platform, yeah!

31
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:23,854
<i>Good for you for finding him.</i>

32
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:26,565
Yeah. Well...

33
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,713
I tell you, this little crate
out there is broken.

34
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,861
I don't know what's going on but,

35
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:34,073
Hey, someone gonna be
here for him, sorry.

36
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,846
- Yeah.
- You just hold him here.

37
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:37,618
Please hold him till they comes.

38
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,078
No, I can't... I can't do that.

39
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,288
- I can't do that, Professor.
- What?

40
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:44,500
Well, he was here... No one was
gonna leave this dog, this--

41
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,377
I... know, I know that. I know,
no one's gonna leave it there.

42
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:48,254
They'll be back for it so...

43
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,131
You take him with ya, and
when anyone show's up...

44
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,007
I'll tell them that you've it.

45
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,467
- Someone gonna be here.
- Yeah.

46
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,927
You know, you don't understand.

47
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,387
Someone will come for him.
Really, just --

48
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:59,306
I'm gonna have to put this in here for
like the whole night if nobody comes.

49
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,246
If they're not here,
I'll locked him in here and

50
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,185
he'll be safe for the night but...

51
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:06,814
I... I... all I can do is take him to
the pound in the morning.

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,371
Well, today's Friday.

53
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:28,210
Know where you went...
Meanwhile stay with me.

54
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:32,172
In a warm house, plenty of company,
you'll be alright.

55
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:35,384
What? Yeah, you'll like it.

56
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:38,780
Sh-sh-sh ...

57
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,450
Alright--

58
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:47,038
Here, sit right here.

59
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,875
Sit right there.
Okay... yeah, here you go.

60
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:56,005
Ok, come on. Stay, stay...
It's your house, it's okay.

61
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,513
Hello, handsome.

62
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:05,598
- Hi.
- Hi.

63
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:07,683
- How did it go?
- It was great.

64
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,603
- You good, you missed me?
- Not a bit, and you?

65
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:13,189
No, didn't think about you none.

66
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,194
I've a little surprise.

67
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:22,239
Yeah... well, I might have a little
surprise for you too.

68
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:24,364
Come on,
we've some catching up to do.

69
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:24,867
Yeah.

70
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,455
Catching up. Catch up!

71
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,972
Do you hear something?

72
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,892
That was a branch against
the window.

73
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,776
- Okay, okay... it's alright!
- Parker!

74
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:42,361
- We had an agreement!
- I know, I know...

75
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,863
- Or did you forget?
- No, I didn't forget!

76
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:48,492
No, he was at the train station.
I mean, it just...

77
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:51,620
Kind of lost. Carl was gonna send him
to the pound tomorrow and I thought...

78
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,748
You just thought you bring him home
and talk me into keeping him, right?

79
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:57,167
No, no, I don't want to keep him.
I don't.

80
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,564
Tomorrow morning I'm
getting up early and find

81
00:08:58,565 --> 00:08:59,961
out exactly where he belongs,
okay. I promise.

82
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,047
I promise you, I will do that.

83
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,800
Alright, this was Lucas's stuff.

84
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,886
Okay... okay.

85
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:10,096
Okay, here we go. Get in there.

86
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:18,938
Now look, a lot of good stuffs here.

87
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:21,649
Keeps you warm, you get that.

88
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,403
This is pretty cool.

89
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,782
You like this?
Yep, this was Luke's favorite.

90
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:33,578
Here's your water.

91
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:38,875
Seems strange. You could tell, huh.
Could ya?

92
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:42,420
Okay, buddy.

93
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:49,427
That's better.

94
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,639
Good night, buddy.

95
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,611
<i>You know, you're the one who's
should be in the doghouse.</i>

96
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:09,739
<i>I promise,
I won't bite your finger.</i>

97
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,583
Puppy, puppy!

98
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,502
Here, hey... puppy.
Puppy, puppy... come on.

99
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:27,798
That's good... ohh.
Good puppy.

100
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,135
Dad, I love him.

101
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,220
Does he have a name yet?

102
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,223
Yes, he does. <i>Temporary guest!</i>

103
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,899
You'll have to keep him.
Don't the house

104
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,568
feel so empty since Lucas been gone.

105
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:50,821
Ask your mother.

106
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,281
Mom!

107
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,199
Yeah?

108
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,867
Could you come here, please?

109
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,038
Look, he even likes your music.

110
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:01,645
Really? I can't believe it,
he's a wonder dog.

111
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:04,251
I absolutely have to keep this.

112
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:07,504
No more dog.
Don't encourage him.

113
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:08,547
I won't!

114
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:09,798
You're so mean.

115
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,926
Dad, he's gonna jump out
of it, here.

116
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:14,595
Oh yeah, that's better.

117
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:20,017
You know what, bud?

118
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:25,105
Well, that's good.
I like it, great!

119
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,816
So, you saw Michael last night?

120
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:33,864
Yeah, we drove over to the look-out.
Looks common but it's beautiful.

121
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,949
Very romantic.

122
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,618
It was.

123
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:44,708
Are you the...

124
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,751
Can I help you, pop?

125
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,170
Yeah... yeah, I just found this little
tyke at the station last night.

126
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:50,589
Can you board him till
we find his owner?

127
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:52,675
Board him?
We can't board him.

128
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,760
This isn't a boarding service,
it's a pound, pal!

129
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:59,556
Look, I just found him,
what am I going to do with him?

130
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,393
Listen...

131
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,523
He's cute. That'll help with
the adoption but...

132
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:11,651
We give them two weeks.

133
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,196
Two weeks?

134
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,699
We're packed!

135
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,244
Excuse me.

136
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:27,584
I'll call you next week then,
alright... bye-bye.

137
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:30,420
- Morning Mary Anne.
- How are you doing, Parker?

138
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,048
I'm doing great. I was wondering
if I could ask you for a favor?

139
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,508
Sure... anything.

140
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:44,475
Oh... look at this!

141
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:48,771
Hey little one. Hello... hello.

142
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,983
Oh... oh, he's gorgeous.
Where did you comes from?

143
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:54,069
Well, he was wandering
around the station last night.

144
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,154
- Hi, sweetheart.
- I don't know, it's pretty strange.

145
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,948
Really? He is adorable!

146
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,034
I just want to put that up.

147
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,119
- Okay, fine... fine!
- Window? - Yep, and over there.

148
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,519
And anyone of those.

149
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:07,915
Parker, this dog is just fabulous!

150
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,792
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

151
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,669
What, the puppy?

152
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,337
Fine young puppy like that.

153
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:16,174
What do you think, Anthonio?
New room-mate?

154
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,676
Oh no, Anthonio!

155
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,764
Sit quietly.

156
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:36,193
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

157
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:37,236
Jess!

158
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,800
Sugar, 2 creams coming up.

159
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,364
- Er-huh.
- Hey, what've you got there?

160
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:42,867
A new friend here, you want a dog?

161
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,618
I prefer cash.

162
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:47,121
It'll be a great guard dog for ya.
Look at it.

163
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:51,500
Guard dog to guard the hot-dogs?
I don't think so.

164
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,294
Ha-ha, I don't think so either.

165
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:56,922
- Sorry about that.
- Why you want a dog, eh?

166
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,050
Everyday you'll have to walk him,

167
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,135
feed him, clean him,
pick up the food...

168
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,595
How many of these gonna help him?

169
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:04,763
On the house.

170
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,140
Why trouble?

171
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,225
Yeah, you're right.
Thank you, Jess.

172
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:09,268
My pleasure.

173
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:11,979
Hey, any news?

174
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,315
No, nobody came, nobody show up,
nobody call.

175
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:15,816
Nobody?

176
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:19,028
Strange, really strange.

177
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,072
Just one second.

178
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:27,369
Cate made up some flyers.
Put that up for me.

179
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,371
Come on!

180
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,540
Alright, I'll put them up for you.

181
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,000
What a samaritan you are.

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,042
I know... I know.

183
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:37,796
He really likes being in the bag.

184
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:41,049
Professor, no dog's on the train.

185
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,635
- No dog's on the train
- Right!

186
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,325
Okay, hold on a second.
Let me show you something.

187
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,265
We skipped the...
repeated the first section,

188
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,204
go directly to the lyrical section.

189
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,247
Let's try that.

190
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:55,290
Okay.

191
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,667
It just mean you've got to
build up quicker.

192
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,752
And then when you, when we
get to the lyrical section, just...

193
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,588
Deep breath, deep breath.

194
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,163
Hello.

195
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,425
That's great.

196
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,716
Do you want a puppy?
You want a puppy

197
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,728
- Well, let's go again.
- Yes, from the start.

198
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,024
This was the only thing
left on the crate.

199
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,236
<i>Yamanashi,</i> it's all I can read.

200
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,281
- Where is that?
- It's a part of central Japan.

201
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,952
- No ordinary dog, Parker.
- I know.

202
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:18,622
It's a Akita. Akita, as you say.

203
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,333
- A very special breed.
- Yeah?

204
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,839
- And what's that?
- Hachi.

205
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,092
- What? - Japanese, for 8,
a number of good fortune.

206
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,929
Good fortune, very nice.

207
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,308
Hachi ... Hachi, it's good name.
I like that.

208
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,394
He might have been born
the eighth in the litter.

209
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:44,898
Spiritual significant in a 8, reaches
up to heaven comes down to earth.

210
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,112
So, will you take him?
You want him?

211
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,991
Me? No, I think he made his choice.

212
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,076
Meaning what?

213
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,329
Well, meaning he's your problem,
not mine brother.

214
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,040
You are not a problem, right?

215
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,380
Well, wether you found
him or he found you,

216
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,134
who's to say. It's meant to be.

217
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:17,347
It's also said that the <i>Shoguns</i> breed
these Akita for combat and hunting.

218
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:21,851
I guess in a way,
they're a kind of dog royalty.

219
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,065
Did Ken give you any ideas where
you can find this royal dog a home?

220
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:35,073
I put up 10 flyers already. You
know, someone gonna claim Hachi.

221
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,200
Who's Hachi?

222
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,996
This... It was what on his collar,
there's this symbol.

223
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,665
You named him?

224
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,916
- No, I didn't...
- Parker, do you wanna keep...

225
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,709
- ...keep him?
- No, I do have...

226
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,003
I don't want to keep him.
I just...

227
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,755
Admit it! You do....
you want to keep it.

228
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,841
- I wasn't even thinking about it.
- Yes!

229
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,260
Hachi?

230
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,888
Where did you go?

231
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,393
Oh no...

232
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,772
Oh god... Parker,
that's months of hard work.

233
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,606
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

234
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,316
I want him to stay out
there all night long.

235
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,172
Do not let him get back in here,
you hear me?

236
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,026
Yes... yes, I hear you.

237
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,611
- End of discussion!
- I hear you!

238
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,739
I hear you.
I heard you alright now.

239
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,250
<i>- It's two months of work!
- Believe me, I'm sorry.</i>

240
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,752
<i>The work is important not only for me,
it is important for the city!</i>

241
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,795
<i>For...</i>

242
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,089
<i>...4 months of work.</i>

243
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,718
<i>No, you do not care what I do.
Yes, you just spit on it!</i>

244
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,679
<i>Cate, that's not true.</i>

245
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>Calm down!</i>

246
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,150
Hachi!

247
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,155
Come on, buddy. Come on.

248
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,741
Yeah, come on inside.

249
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,577
And I'll take these too.

250
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,052
Okay...

251
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,389
...found you here.

252
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,185
Yeah, here you are.

253
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:34,525
Your blood line goes back at least
4000 years, maybe much more.

254
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,779
Yeah?
What else we've got here?

255
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,620
Look at that.

256
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:54,836
It's said the first partnership
between man and animal is with you.

257
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,173
Do you knew about that?
You knew that already?

258
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,592
You did, didn't you?
Yeah, you did.

259
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,221
There you are.

260
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,725
Let's see, settle you down now.

261
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,273
This isn't too bad.

262
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,361
Alright, stay there.
Stay there now, okay.

263
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,499
Sit quietly. Now...

264
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,381
<i>... no idea that Stan was inside,
so they... lean out there.</i>

265
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,945
<i>... out there and shoot the
ball into the right field,</i>

266
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,509
<i>which's what they did in game 2.</i>

267
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,848
All right there,
just step a little bit closer.

268
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:51,351
<i> ... bad. Still one point in the lead</i>

269
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,192
Catch!

270
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,903
Come on.

271
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:38,064
Forgive me, please.

272
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:40,149
Don't move...

273
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,777
- I was just coming up.
- Yeah, yeah... sure.

274
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,535
Just one night.
One night only, okay?

275
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:53,329
Be a good boy.

276
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,500
Stay there, alright. You will be fine.

277
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:05,299
I can't believe it.
He loves the <i>Yankees.</i>

278
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:06,759
No.

279
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,053
- Yeah, honestly.
- Really?

280
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,472
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

281
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:13,557
Alright... Hachi,
this is what we gonna do.

282
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,851
This is ball. Ball.

283
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:18,979
Throw, you go get it.
You bring it back, okay?

284
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:20,856
Okay, you ready?

285
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:23,776
Go get it! Go get it!

286
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:26,987
No, no, no, the ball.

287
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:30,240
Hachi, Hachi! Hachi--
Hey, Hachi!

288
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:31,686
Hachi--

289
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:35,245
I'll throw it, you bring it, okay?
Good!

290
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:38,040
Go get it!

291
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,170
Hachi, no, no, no.
Get the ball!

292
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,799
Hachi, come here.
Hachi, come here!

293
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,386
Go get it. Wait... wait.
Hachi... Hachi.

294
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:54,848
Come on, this ball.
See this ball, come here.

295
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:59,019
Come here, Hachi. Hachi, come here.
You can do this. I know you can.

296
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:01,647
I just think that you're being
a little tough about that dog.

297
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:04,650
That dog's in a fix and dad just
trying to do the right thing.

298
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:07,986
<i> Okay, let's see. </i>

299
00:24:07,986 --> 00:24:08,945
Mom!

300
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:13,533
<i>Ball, ball, ball, ball!
Get the ball!</i>

301
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,285
Hey, come on.

302
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:20,916
He has lost it.

303
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,129
Hello?

304
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:30,217
Oh, the puppy flyer, yes?
Are you the dog's owner?

305
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:35,326
No, no one comes forward yet.

306
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:37,724
We just want to make sure
the dog has a good home.

307
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,186
Could I get your number?

308
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:42,937
I'm sure my husband
would want to call you.

309
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,149
One second, I need to find a pen,
hold on.

310
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,259
Hello.

311
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,264
The dog's already been taken.

312
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,270
I'm really sorry.

313
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:53,883
Ow! No, no, no, Hachi!

314
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,968
Hachi Hachi Hachi Hachi!

315
00:25:57,637 --> 00:26:00,348
Come on! Take it in. Take it in!

316
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:04,226
No, you can't go. Can't go.
Gotta work.

317
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,520
See you back here tonight, bye.

318
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:45,934
Good morning, Professor.
You are late today.

319
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:49,271
- I'm already working.
- One sugar, two creams.

00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:14,171
Hachi!

323
00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:19,926
What're you doing here? What are
you doing? What're you doing.

324
00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:22,429
You gotta go home, okay.
Go... No!

325
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:24,181
Yes, I know. Go, go home,
go on.

326
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:27,934
Go home! Go on!
I gotta get on the train. Go... go!

327
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:29,853
Okay, come on... gotta go.
Come on!

328
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:32,022
Ho-oh... Professor, you want
me to hold him?

329
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:33,064
Yeah... could you?

a moment, alright.

Go, go, go, go... go on home.

- Alright, let her go.
- Let her go!

343
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:11,644
You want me to call you a cab?

344
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:15,190
No, I'll walk him home.

00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:26,034
Oh, God.

346
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:34,792
Parker? I thought you left for work.

347
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:37,420
- I didn't go.
- You're gardening now?

348
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,505
He ran out, missed the train.

349
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:43,176
Don't say it.
I know what you're going to say.

350
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:44,782
No, let me do this.
You're gonna get filthy.

351
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,387
I'll fill it, get the next train.

352
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:48,639
- Okay.
- Thanks!

353
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:53,978
And you - you stay.

354
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:56,147
- He will.
- See you tonight.

355
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:44,737
Here's your treat!

356
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:46,613
Here's your treat!

357
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,663
Alright, okay... just one more.
Just one more, that's it.

358
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:55,706
Hold on! Hold on!

359
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:04,256
Well... you're okay?

360
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:08,427
Alright, alright... this's the last.

361
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:12,055
Here you go. Good boy, Hachi!

362
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,274
Okay, one last one.

363
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,027
Take it.

364
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:46,172
That's great... that's really great
everybody. I'm proud of ya.

365
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:49,718
<i>- Finally.
- And the ending to be repeated.</i>

366
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,803
- Sorry, I'm running late.
- No problem.

367
00:30:51,803 --> 00:30:53,972
- Off the hook?
<i>- Yeah!</i>

368
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:55,015
Good, thank you.

369
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,846
Hey, Hachi!
What are you doing here?

370
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,723
<i>Sugar in your drink.</i>

371
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:09,797
- Chuck.
- Good bye.

372
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,477
Hey... hey Hachi.

373
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:27,606
What're you doing here?

374
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:29,692
Bedridge Station!

375
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:35,239
Yes, yes, ma'am,
we've got one at 7:30.

376
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,244
He's been here all day?

377
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,329
No... no, he's just rode up 2 minutes
ago. He went right there.

378
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,707
You're kidding. You seen Cate?

379
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:46,500
I haven't seen her.

380
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,794
Okay.

381
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:52,005
Ok... come on.
Guess we'll go home.

382
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,093
That son of a gun.

383
00:32:56,093 --> 00:33:01,807
Come on, come on, boy.
Come on... come on.

384
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:05,352
Mom!

385
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,437
Yeah sweetie, I'm in here.

386
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,691
- Hey... hi!
- Hi!

387
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:12,359
- I got the chips.
- Oh, thanks.

388
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,902
 Hi...Mrs. Wilson, good to see you.

389
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:15,988
Oh, Michael, nice to see you!
Call me Cate.

390
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:18,030
Ok. Thank you... thank you.

391
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,741
Everything looks delicious.

392
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:22,035
- It's a great spread.
- Why don't you take this to dad?

393
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,620
- You sure?
- Yeah, he's out back.

394
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,163
Okay, the grill's ready?

395
00:33:25,163 --> 00:33:27,374
It's getting there, yeah.
Yeah, nice to see you.

396
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,417
Nice to meet you.

397
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,502
- Cut? And where is...
- Yeah, that would be great, honey.

398
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:36,133
You know, I actually took
the dialog when I was a kid.

399
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,175
You do?

400
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,970
Yeah, when I was nine
or ten years old.

401
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,431
I had to stop because my brother
slammed my fingers in the car door.

402
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:46,852
I mean he always said that
it was an accident but

403
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:48,937
after that, I don't know...
I stopped practising.

404
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:52,482
I wish I didn't though cause
I really loved music,

405
00:33:52,482 --> 00:33:56,987
and I've so much respect for
musicians and people playing...

406
00:33:56,987 --> 00:33:59,364
Michael, do you love my daughter?

407
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:03,952
Yes, sir... Yes, I do.

408
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:06,559
You know... that's good.
Cause that's what

409
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,165
you want to remember
on a bad days.

410
00:34:11,042 --> 00:34:12,919
Right.

411
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:18,466
Hachi, this is Michael.
<i>Michael, Hachi.</i>

412
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:20,218
Pleased to meet you.

413
00:34:24,597 --> 00:34:27,517
Hachi, hey... you wanna play
a little catch, huh?

414
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:30,353
Yeah... ready?
Okay, go get the ball.

415
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:34,315
Go get it... there it is.
Go get the ball, right there.

416
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:38,987
Go Hachi, go get it.
Go... go get the ball.

417
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:41,802
Go get it.

418
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:42,793
Micheal, you want to get
that ball back,

419
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:43,783
you gonna have to get it yourself.
Hachi doesn't fetch.

420
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,993
He doesn't do it!?

421
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:49,539
Okay!

422
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,667
Are you alright... are you okay?

423
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,709
- All is good.
- Honey, are you okay?

424
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,752
Honey, are you okay?

425
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:55,795
Keep playing.

426
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:56,838
- Totally, I'm gonna get the ball.
- Are you sure?

427
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:57,880
Okay!

428
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,092
I'm good. Look at that.

429
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:03,803
- Everything okay?
- Don't let me distrupt the game.

430
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:04,845
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,727
Look, I'll throw the ball,
just one foot. Go get it, okay?

432
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:15,064
Really, if I... even if I just tossed
it right here, he's not gonna get it?

433
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,917
Argh!

434
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,045
Ball?

435
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:40,839
Fetch, right. I throw it,
he brings it back. He won't do it.

436
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,925
Not Akita, Parker.

437
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:45,219
They have something
against fetching?

438
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:47,555
No, if you wants a dog
that fetches,

439
00:35:47,556 --> 00:35:49,890
you get a collie,
you get a sprinter-spaniel.

440
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,767
Alright, Hachi fine with me.
I'm okay.

441
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:55,729
Well good, because Akita's
are not into people pleasing.

442
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,189
What are they up to?

443
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,734
It comes with the training because
of your special connection.

444
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:04,696
Hey buddy, go get that ball.
Why would you do that?

445
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:09,076
Well, for fun. For a cookies.

446
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:11,161
Because it made me happy, basically.

447
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:15,249
They can't be bought.
They're Japanese not Americans.

448
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:16,792
- Yeah, American...
- I know.

449
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:21,797
Well, if he's gonna fetch, it'll
be for a very special reason.

450
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:25,759
I'll find a reason.

451
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,846
No, no, no, no...
Hac, come on.

452
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:32,140
You can't go. I'm sorry.
You can't go, come on.

453
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,145
No, stay.

454
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,449
Okay! Come on... come on.

455
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,492
It's alright... come on.

456
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,221
Come on. Good boy.

457
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:57,590
Hey...Hac Hac Hac Hac!
Come on, come on!

458
00:37:00,374 --> 00:37:04,836
Hey...Hac--
Hey...

459
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,309
Let's go!
Come on. Come here.

460
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,306
- Good morning, Milton.
- Good morning.

461
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:14,349
How're you doing today?

462
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,768
- Myra.
- Morning Parker.

463
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,770
Stayed out of the sun.

464
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,275
Careful.

465
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:31,095
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

466
00:37:31,096 --> 00:37:32,492
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning, Parker!

467
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:34,577
He won't bite, eh?

468
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:36,663
Oh no, he's doing really good.

469
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:37,705
Come on, boy!

470
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:40,646
Alright, I want you to go
straight home.

471
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,044
Go straight home,
you understand me?

472
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:46,381
I'll see you here tonight.
So go ahead... go on home.

473
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:50,218
Good boy. Good boy!

474
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:59,393
- Great day Carl, isn't it?
- Have a good one, professor.

475
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:09,737
Hachi!

476
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:15,660
There... yeah, sh-sh-sh ...
Don't tell Milton, okay?

477
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,528
Hey... Hachi.

478
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:55,946
Oh, what a good boy.

479
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,147
You've been waiting for me all
day and thinking...

480
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:07,503
<i>Oh, how good I am, how good I am!</i>

481
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,051
Hey, Hac!

482
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:24,394
More champagne!
Bring more champagne.

483
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:26,772
I could, well... I don't know.

484
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:27,814
Should be in the kitchen.

485
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:30,651
<i>Seems like no one else at
the wedding other than us.</i>

486
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:34,071
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

487
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,537
You love the snow, huh?

488
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,214
Let's take a walk, you and me.

489
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:54,925
Only the two of us, let's go.

490
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,927
Tell me about something.

491
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,534
Hachi!

492
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,462
That's great, Jake.

493
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:33,505
<i>Thanks.</i>

494
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:36,549
Cate! Have you seen Hachi?
He wasn't at the station.

495
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,511
No, I haven't seen him since
this morning.

496
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:41,554
- Hmm.
- Here!

497
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:46,768
Look at her.

498
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:52,815
Can you believe they had
her cover for 30 years?

499
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,027
It's beautiful.

500
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:58,237
Yes, yes.

501
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:04,160
- I'm falling behind schedule.
- Aww, you'll catch up.

502
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,871
Just think about opening night,
that will freak you out?

503
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:12,502
The young soloist step down stage
sings from La Bohème.

504
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:16,735
And then dance, of course.
Following that,

505
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:20,968
rock, rap, hip-hop, jazz and...
Hamlet!

506
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:26,959
Then, of course, the entire town is
going to rise up, standing ovation,

507
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:28,226
the whole place going crazy.

508
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,708
Mayor seize you down,
he pulls you up on stage,

509
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:33,773
put you center stage and thank
you for making it all possible.

510
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:34,815
Yeah?

511
00:41:34,815 --> 00:41:35,858
Yeah!

512
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,735
I like it.

513
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:41,614
Hachi!

514
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:45,451
Come on boy.

515
00:41:50,998 --> 00:41:52,333
Hachi?

516
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,214
Hachi!

517
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:04,011
What are you doing?

518
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,312
Alright!

519
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:19,985
Stay, stay Hachi.

520
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:23,614
Sh-sh-sh, don't bother it.

521
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,495
Okay, go on, go away.
Go on, get out!

522
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:38,960
Get...  get, get out of here.
Get out! Get out!

523
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,271
Well, okay.

524
00:42:57,689 --> 00:42:59,107
Come on... come on.

525
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,810
Wooh!

526
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:05,045
Ugh!

527
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,084
Parker!

528
00:43:33,308 --> 00:43:35,059
We got skunk!

529
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:38,313
You want to come in with us?

530
00:43:38,313 --> 00:43:39,981
No, I'm going to pass.

531
00:43:42,275 --> 00:43:43,526
Well, okay.

532
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:50,825
Better open the window
before you go to sleep.

533
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,162
You really think we smell
that bad?

534
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:58,833
Perhaps you're right.

535
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:05,923
Mom!

536
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,260
Oh, hi honey.

537
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,762
What's up?

538
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,142
Hey, can I tell you something?

539
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:18,978
Guess what?

540
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:20,021
What?

541
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:21,981
- Okay, wait... that's right.
- What?

542
00:44:25,693 --> 00:44:27,737
See anything different?

543
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:29,488
No.

544
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:30,531
Yes!

545
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:34,702
Oh... it's so sweet.

546
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:37,955
Oh, it's so wonderful!

547
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:40,583
I've to call grandma right away.

548
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:42,543
Where is dad?

549
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:44,211
Out there, as usual.

550
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:46,881
Daddy!

551
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,260
Dad!

552
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,265
Dad, what're you doing?

553
00:44:56,265 --> 00:45:00,644
It's a full body massage,
following the book, see it?

554
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:02,438
You're gonna be a grandfather.

555
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:03,689
You gotta get really deep
down into the muscle...

556
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:05,774
Dad, dad!

557
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,071
Micheal and I are having a baby.
I am pregnant.

558
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:13,490
You...

559
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:18,704
Really?

560
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:19,747
Yes.

561
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:21,498
You're having a baby?

562
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,548
- I'm going to be a grandpa.
- Yes.

563
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:33,385
Cathy, I can't believe this!

564
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:37,294
This is terrific news.
I'm so happy for you.

565
00:45:38,724 --> 00:45:40,267
Hi sweetie.

566
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:42,060
- Mom.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

567
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:44,646
Oh, what you got?

568
00:45:44,646 --> 00:45:46,523
All kinds of healthy things for you.

569
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:50,819
Fresh vegetables, raspberries,
pita with cholesterol-less sprouts...

570
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:53,781
You know, when I was carrying you,

571
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:55,262
I was sending out your
father for pizza with red pepper

572
00:45:55,263 --> 00:45:56,742
and double anchovies for
a week straight.

573
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:58,744
He couldn't even watch when I eat it.

574
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:03,331
You and dad have been
together for 25 years.

575
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:05,625
We've been longer together
than we've been apart.

576
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,668
Wow.

577
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:14,968
Dad said after your first date,
by the time he got back...

578
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,346
to the car, he miss you so much,
he went back for you.

579
00:46:19,055 --> 00:46:21,558
I know, I was watching
from the window.

580
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:24,748
And when I saw him come
up the walk again,

581
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:27,313
I almost ran out the door
and jumps into his arm.

582
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:29,274
- Should have.
- I know.

583
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:31,359
But I always stop and
think too much.

584
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,778
That's true... you do.

585
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:35,113
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

586
00:46:35,113 --> 00:46:36,156
Okay!

587
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,535
Hey, Hachi!
Come on... Hachi, come on.

588
00:46:41,786 --> 00:46:43,246
He always greets him there?

589
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:44,289
Look.

590
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,711
- Isn't it strange?
- Come on, let's go home.

591
00:46:52,005 --> 00:46:53,172
Hey, Mr. Professor.

592
00:46:53,172 --> 00:46:54,632
Good night, Parker!

593
00:46:54,632 --> 00:46:55,675
Good night, Mary Anne.

594
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:56,926
How do you taught your
dog to do that?

595
00:46:56,926 --> 00:46:59,012
That's amazing, everyday.

596
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,816
Parker!

597
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:18,823
Parker!

598
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:38,968
You're all dress.

599
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:46,475
Well, that might be something
I'll be able to do without.

600
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:49,603
Thank you.

601
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:54,066
Anything else you required, madam?

602
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:57,403
It depends on what you've got.

603
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:00,739
Everything.

604
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:01,782
Everything?

605
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:16,380
Yeah... everything.

606
00:48:30,018 --> 00:48:33,230
You've to put up with a lot,
I know that.

607
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:37,109
I don't remember ever
thanking you.

608
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:47,244
You know how much I love you.

609
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:52,457
And I love you.

610
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,043
Strange.

611
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:01,717
Especially when you do smell
like a dog or a skunk.

612
00:49:03,802 --> 00:49:06,638
That doesn't happen very often,
actually you should worried about...

613
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:08,932
It happens, just don't know when.

614
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,950
- I love you. Call you later.
- And I love you too, bye-bye.

615
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:33,206
Okay, Hachi... come on.

616
00:49:37,794 --> 00:49:39,587
Hachi... come on.

617
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:44,801
Come on now, what's wrong
with you... come on.

618
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:48,638
What's it?

619
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,728
Come here Come here!
Come here...

620
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,150
Come here, what's with you?
Come here now, you've got a problem?

621
00:50:03,444 --> 00:50:06,698
Alright, what's going on?

622
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:12,203
Alright... okay.
Alright now, okay.

623
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,028
Come on! Come on!

624
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,085
What's wrong with him?

625
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,753
I don't know.

626
00:50:20,753 --> 00:50:23,799
Hachi, you wanna come because
I've got to go, it's a work day.

627
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,587
Come on, buddy.
Come on!

628
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:28,594
I've got to go.

629
00:50:29,303 --> 00:50:32,139
- Love you, honey.
- Love you too. See you tonight.

630
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,768
Last chance.

631
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,313
Bye!

632
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:09,552
- Hi, Mary Anne.
- Hey Jess, how're you?

633
00:51:09,552 --> 00:51:13,305
- I already've your coffee and donuts.
- Oh yeah, thank you. - Alright.

634
00:51:26,985 --> 00:51:28,445
Where's Hachi?

635
00:51:36,453 --> 00:51:38,747
Hey, Hachi.

636
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,166
Ah, here he comes.

637
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,711
Oh, I'm happy to see you.

638
00:51:44,711 --> 00:51:46,797
Why did you bring the ball for?

639
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:48,882
<i>Why you giving me the ball?</i>

640
00:51:48,882 --> 00:51:51,802
You want to play catch?
Here, here... here.

641
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:52,470
Wait... wait!

642
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:55,138
Here boy. Go get it!

643
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,350
Go get it. Go get it!

644
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,478
Quite good. Now, bring it back.

645
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:05,857
Oh... that's it.
That's what I wanted.

646
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:08,902
Try another one. Big one.
Big long one.

647
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:12,121
Okay, go get it. Go on!

648
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:17,035
Good boy!
Oh yeah, now bring it back.

649
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,312
Okay, come on... come on.
Come on!

650
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:22,874
Come on. Oh, what a good boy.
What a good boy.

651
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:26,127
Aren't you the good boy?
You see that.

652
00:52:26,127 --> 00:52:27,170
Hmm.

653
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,924
Threw the ball, he brought it back.
First time he fetch. A real fetch.

654
00:52:30,924 --> 00:52:33,301
Congratulations.

655
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:36,012
Thanks you. Good boy!

656
00:52:36,012 --> 00:52:39,557
Okay, gotta go work.
Come on, take the ball.

657
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:43,103
First time!

658
00:52:43,103 --> 00:52:44,896
Heh, first time!

659
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:49,484
<i>No... wait, Mr. Professor! Wait!
I'll make you a coffee right now.</i>

660
00:52:49,484 --> 00:52:50,527
Alright.

661
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:51,569
Sorry, I'm late today.

662
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:53,133
Did you see what he did?

663
00:52:53,134 --> 00:52:54,697
I threw the ball, he brought it back.
It was a fetch.

664
00:52:54,697 --> 00:52:56,157
No, no, no.

665
00:52:56,157 --> 00:52:58,243
You keep the ball.

666
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:01,246
Do you want me to have that?
I can't play now.

667
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:03,456
I've got to go to work.
I've got to go to work.

668
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,625
I'll take the ball, alright.

669
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,377
- Okay.
- Here you go.

670
00:53:07,377 --> 00:53:09,045
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

671
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:11,130
- See you at 5.
- I will be here.

672
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,633
Okay! Go home Hac... go home.

673
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:25,103
Alright... come here!
Come here... come here.

674
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:28,022
Okay, it's alright.

675
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:33,236
See you at 5 o' clock, alright.
Here you go. Hey, go home, go on.

676
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:33,212
You think it was better that time?

677
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:34,254
<i> Laughter.</i>

678
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:37,382
<i>(Inaudible)</i>

679
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:43,305
Alright, you remember we were
talking about John Philip Sousa,

680
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:47,184
a great <i>March</i> composer
at the turn of the century?

681
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:53,440
He... very famous man but he
had a huge thing about...

682
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,568
... recorded music. He never
allowed his music to be recorded.

683
00:54:56,568 --> 00:54:59,113
Even when Thomas Edison
came to him

684
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:01,657
with his brand new invention
- the phonograph.

685
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:05,682
But Edison's didn't care, he
went ahead and did it anyhow.

686
00:55:05,683 --> 00:55:09,081
He secretly recorded his
marching band in a parade.

687
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:12,501
I guess makes it the very
first boot-leg.

688
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,342
So what do you think about that?
Do you think Sousa was right?

689
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:22,261
Do you think it's okay now?

690
00:55:22,262 --> 00:55:24,179
What about today's performance,
will you be able to just walk up...

691
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:25,578
to the middle of the stage,

692
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:30,977
plug in your CD player to a <i>Marshall
Stack</i> and that's it, good enough?

693
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,022
I don't know.

694
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,443
I am a lot older than you but

695
00:55:36,444 --> 00:55:41,821
I tend to think that
there's an element of music...

696
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:45,386
... that cannot be capture.
Life cannot be capture.

697
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:46,951
The human heart cannot
be captured.

698
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:50,288
The moment of creation
itself is fleeting.

699
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,574
<i>Oh my God!</i>

700
00:56:26,574 --> 00:56:28,534
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

701
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:30,620
<i>It looks like a heart attack.</i>

702
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:41,172
Hey Hachi... how're you doing?

703
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:43,966
Hey Hachi.

704
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,054
See you tomorrow, Hachi.

705
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,556
Good night, Hachi.

706
00:57:47,863 --> 00:57:49,865
Hey, buddy.

707
00:57:50,991 --> 00:57:52,701
You ready to go home?

708
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,680
Yeah.

709
00:58:30,697 --> 00:58:32,532
Hey, Hachi.

710
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,952
Are you alright?

711
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:49,924
And that's how he did it?

712
00:58:49,924 --> 00:58:52,010
Sorry, I'm learning.

713
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:05,064
Andy! Time to go... sweetheart.

714
00:59:06,483 --> 00:59:10,278
Good boy. You stay here, okay.
We'll be back.

715
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,810
I've said that the soul is
not more than the body.

716
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,439
And I have said, that the body
is not more than the soul.

717
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,777
And nothing, not God is greater
to one than one self is.

718
00:59:51,777 --> 00:59:54,864
I hear,
behold God in every object

719
00:59:54,865 --> 00:59:57,950
that understand God not
in the least.

720
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:02,621
Nor do I understand who's there
can be more wonderful than myself.

721
01:00:02,621 --> 01:00:05,645
In the faces of men and women,

722
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:08,669
I see God and in my own face
in a glance.

723
01:00:08,669 --> 01:00:11,589
I find letters from God
dropped in the street

724
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,508
and everyone signed by
God's name.

725
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:17,428
But I leave them where there are

726
01:00:17,428 --> 01:00:22,766
for I know that wherever I go,
others will constant comes.

727
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:25,978
Forever and ever.

728
01:01:21,366 --> 01:01:25,746
Look, you don't have
to wait anymore.

729
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:29,708
He's not coming back.

730
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:46,266
Alright Hachi,
you do what you've to do.

731
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:33,938
Come on... buddy.
Come on... let's go.

732
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:35,898
Come on boy, come on.

733
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,863
Come on Hachi.
Come on Hachi.

734
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:44,866
You're gonna be with us now.
Let's go... come on.

735
01:02:46,075 --> 01:02:48,619
Alright, time to go, Ronnie's waiting.
Come on.

736
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,937
Let me get that for you, sweetie.

737
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:00,673
Come on, Hac, up, up up.
Here we go.

738
01:03:00,673 --> 01:03:04,844
What a good boy.
Come on Hachi.

739
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,280
Watch your head.
Watch your head!

740
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:11,843
Good boy!

741
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:08,782
Hey, there's my guy!
Andy!

742
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:09,825
- Yeah?
- Hachi!

743
01:04:09,825 --> 01:04:10,868
Hachi!

744
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:13,245
- Andy!
- What, dear?

745
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:16,832
Hachi! Hachi! Come back here.

746
01:04:18,148 --> 01:04:18,682
Hachi!

747
01:04:20,664 --> 01:04:21,864
Hachi...come on!

748
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,196
<i>Hachi!</i>

749
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:29,890
<i>Hachi!</i>

750
01:06:44,436 --> 01:06:46,689
<i>Inaudible dialog</i>

751
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:49,817
Hey, looks like we got the
first visitor.

752
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:54,196
Hey there buddy! Come to
welcome us to our new home?

753
01:06:55,322 --> 01:06:57,533
<i>We started from the top,
where almost everything is ready.</i>

754
01:06:57,533 --> 01:06:59,410
<i>Yeah, but something
with the basement too?</i>

755
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,370
<i>The cellar has long
been ready.</i>

756
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:08,877
<i>Donut with chocolate icing.</i>

757
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:11,588
<i>No, I don't like chocolate.</i>

758
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:14,925
Hey Hachi,
what are you doing here?

759
01:07:14,925 --> 01:07:17,553
Look it... look it!

760
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:23,392
He's staying right in the
same spot.

761
01:07:23,392 --> 01:07:26,395
- I thought he moved away.
- He did.

762
01:07:26,395 --> 01:07:31,316
- He looks hungry, huh.
- You're a softie, Jess.

763
01:07:31,316 --> 01:07:33,402
<i>We must give him a little.</i>

764
01:07:33,402 --> 01:07:40,617
Hey, Hachi! Want a hotdog, bud?
Come on, boy.

765
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,330
Maybe he don't likes your
cooking, Jess.

766
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,875
This is Jess special. Come on, lick it.
You'll like it. It's good for you.

767
01:07:55,966 --> 01:07:57,842
Where did he comes from?

768
01:07:57,842 --> 01:08:00,971
Just show up.
Come on boy! Eat it.

769
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:06,184
Oh... you better be careful. Hachi
got hotdogs in there older than you.

770
01:08:06,184 --> 01:08:08,520
Don't listen to them.

771
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:24,577
Hachi.

772
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:25,870
Oh, God.

773
01:08:25,912 --> 01:08:28,915
Hi! Oh... hi, I was so worried
about you...

774
01:08:31,709 --> 01:08:33,294
<i>I need you.</i>

775
01:08:33,294 --> 01:08:35,588
And why does she just
hanging around him for?

776
01:08:35,588 --> 01:08:39,550
This the professor's daughter.
He probably lived with them.

777
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,636
<i>And Hachi ran out?</i>

778
01:08:41,636 --> 01:08:42,679
<i>Disappeared?</i>

779
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:44,055
<i>Oh, dear God...</i>

780
01:08:44,055 --> 01:08:46,140
Will you come home with me?

781
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:48,101
Hey, hey, hey, hey, she took it.

782
01:08:48,102 --> 01:08:49,143
It's alright. It's okay.

783
01:08:49,143 --> 01:08:50,520
It's okay.

784
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:54,148
- Come on, come on
- Let's go, buddy.

785
01:08:54,148 --> 01:08:56,025
Thank you very much.

786
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:06,369
- That's the best stuff.
- Alright, get me a coffee.

787
01:09:08,037 --> 01:09:10,331
Jess, come on, pour me a coffee.

788
01:09:24,387 --> 01:09:28,140
I think of him too, everyday.

789
01:09:56,502 --> 01:09:57,670
Hey.

790
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:04,343
You know we love you Hachi.
We want you to stay here with us.

791
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:12,684
If you've to go, that's okay too.

792
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,313
Okay!

793
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:36,875
Bye, Hachi.

794
01:10:48,553 --> 01:10:50,847
Good afternoon, Hachi.

795
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:27,133
Hey Hachi, here you go.
Don't tell Myra, alright!

796
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:31,095
Good night, Hachi.

797
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:59,040
- Good morning, Jess.
- Hello, how are you?

798
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,794
- I think a big hot dog and
two donuts. - Okay.

799
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,886
<i>Be careful, it's hot.</i>

800
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:19,602
<i>Lucky, let's go!</i>

801
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:21,979
Come on, sweetie.
Hey, Lucky!

802
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:25,524
- Your coffee, enjoy your meal.
- Here girl. Come on Lucky, let's go.

803
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:35,951
- Oh, excuse me, sir. - Uh-hmm?
- That dog out there...

804
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:37,745
Yeah?

805
01:12:37,745 --> 01:12:40,873
Is that the dog that I've been
hearing so much about?

806
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,835
What's it to you?

807
01:12:44,835 --> 01:12:49,632
Oh, I am sorry. I'm Teddy Barnes,
I'm with the Metro column.

808
01:12:50,841 --> 01:12:54,094
Yeah, I've been hearing a lot
of talks about him on the train.

809
01:12:54,094 --> 01:12:57,348
I don't know. Sounds like
it could make a good story.

810
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:02,561
That's Boilils, Carl Boilils.

811
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:05,981
B-o-i-l-i-l-s.

812
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:07,024
- Yes, there's no 'Y' in there.
- Got it.

813
01:13:07,066 --> 01:13:10,152
I'm the one that found him,
handed him over.

814
01:13:10,194 --> 01:13:11,737
Oh yeah?

815
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:16,116
So Carl... where does he live?

816
01:13:16,116 --> 01:13:20,913
Well... we're not really sure.
He comes and goes.

817
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:23,624
- Nobody bothers him?
- No, we put up with him.

818
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,335
He just does what's he is doing.

819
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:31,340
Mind if I take a picture?
For the newspaper.

820
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,051
Oh, I don't mind,
Hachi don't mind?

821
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:35,927
Thank you very much.
Very nice... very nice.

822
01:13:35,927 --> 01:13:38,764
Er... one without first please.

823
01:13:38,764 --> 01:13:41,767
Not the dog, alright.
Stay there.

824
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:44,394
Hmm... No, I...

825
01:13:45,062 --> 01:13:47,814
- Oh yeah, alright.
- I appreciated it.

826
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:50,650
That's very kind of you.

827
01:13:51,735 --> 01:13:53,361
Okay, nice and easy.

828
01:13:53,361 --> 01:13:54,821
- Oh yeah!
- Yeah... yeah.

829
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:56,907
Look there, big smile.

830
01:13:56,907 --> 01:13:59,284
Smile... Aah, that's...

831
01:14:00,484 --> 01:14:02,684
That's beautiful, thank you.

<i>Faithful dog awaits return

833
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:17,427
Hey Hachi.

834
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:23,391
This kid in Gary,

835
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:26,227
He ask me to buy you
treats with it.

It's the third one this week.

837
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:32,984
If this keeps up, I've gotta
open a bank account for you.

838
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,695
Don't say I never gave you though.

839
01:14:39,032 --> 01:14:41,326
Dog's making it like a bandit here.

840
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:44,579
Look at this! Isn't that cute?

01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:02,305
- Be right with you, sir.
- Thank you.

844
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:22,408
Hello Hachi, how are you?

845
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:27,830
Here you are Hachi.
There you are.

846
01:15:28,623 --> 01:15:30,333
Hungry... eh?

847
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:34,211
Yes, very cold. He must eat.

848
01:15:35,671 --> 01:15:38,674
I'm just Jess,
I run the hotdog stand.

849
01:15:38,674 --> 01:15:41,427
I'm Ken-Vijish,
Professor Wilson's friend.

Mr. Professor, ha.

851

One sugar, two creams.

852
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:49,477
So then you must have
read the article then?

853
01:15:49,477 --> 01:15:50,519
I did!

854
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:52,605
You saw my name in the article?

855
01:15:52,605 --> 01:15:54,773
Yes, I did. That...

856
01:15:54,773 --> 01:15:55,816
Twice.

857
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:58,319
Please, let me help with the expense.

858
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:00,613
No, no, no, please. No money.

859
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:02,698
What if he get sick?
Medical expenses...

860
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:05,472
They get collection,
from the travellers,

861
01:16:05,473 --> 01:16:08,245
the vendors and
we will take care of it.

862
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:10,581

roams now.

863
01:16:10,582 --> 01:16:12,916

same place...

864
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,376
... here only.

865
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:15,961
You'll do that for him?

866
01:16:15,961 --> 01:16:17,713
Take care of him?

867
01:16:17,713 --> 01:16:19,298
Of course!

868
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:25,429
Okay then.
Got to serve some hotdogs.

869
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:26,472
Good to meet you.

870
01:16:26,472 --> 01:16:28,974
Me too.
Thank you very much.

871
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:21,860
Come on, mister.
Here we go.

872
01:17:25,613 --> 01:17:29,784
Want some more?
Here, take this.

873
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:36,541
Okay... come on boy, last piece.
Taste good, eh?

874
01:17:47,093 --> 01:17:48,636
<i>This is where you
all brought it?</i>

875
01:17:48,636 --> 01:17:51,764
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- See you tomorrow, Hachi.</i>

876
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:54,809
<i>Ciao, Hachi!</i>

877
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,640
<i>Thanks.</i>

878
01:18:47,737 --> 01:18:50,072
<i>The usual, eh?</i>

879
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:52,658
<i>Why you ever not take
chicken wings?</i>

880
01:18:52,658 --> 01:18:53,701
<i>Hey, this...</i>

881
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:54,743
<i>Mustard?</i>

882
01:18:55,786 --> 01:18:58,080
Mrs. Wilson, nice to see you.

883
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,123
Good afternoon.

884
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,752
Hey, that's the professor's wife, eh?

885
01:19:14,555 --> 01:19:16,890
<i>Now Showing
The Merchant of Venice</i>

886
01:19:56,263 --> 01:20:00,475
<i>Parker H. Wilson
Loving husband and father</i>

887
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:05,897
Cate.

888
01:20:09,526 --> 01:20:10,861
Ken...

889
01:20:13,572 --> 01:20:15,657
It's been awhile.

890
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:18,368
Certainly have.

891
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:32,757
It's 10 years... can you believe it.

892
01:20:47,355 --> 01:20:49,148
Hi Hachi!

893
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,782
<i>Good day, Hachi.</i>

894
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:13,736
<i>Coffee without sugar, and don't
put mustard in the hot dog.</i>

895
01:21:13,737 --> 01:21:16,134
<i>Ketchup is the best.</i>

896
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:18,219
Alright, have a good one.

897
01:21:41,909 --> 01:21:43,661
Hachi?

898
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:52,336
Hachi...

899
01:21:56,173 --> 01:21:59,301
Oh, you poor thing,
you're still waiting.

900
01:22:10,271 --> 01:22:12,564
Good boy.

901
01:22:14,316 --> 01:22:17,444
Hachi!

902
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:36,130
If it's alright, could I wait with
you for the next train?

903
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:40,509
Yeah?

904
01:22:42,052 --> 01:22:44,137
Thanks.

905
01:22:52,896 --> 01:22:54,564
Oh, Hachi...

906
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:08,412
<i>You're so tiny.</i>

907
01:23:08,453 --> 01:23:09,496
<i>You like that mom?</i>

908
01:23:09,496 --> 01:23:10,539
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

909
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:12,499
Let's go somewhere.

910
01:23:12,499 --> 01:23:13,542
Oh, that's me.

911
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:16,566
I know, I remember.

912
01:23:16,567 --> 01:23:19,589
I remember I was there that day
when the picture was taken.

913
01:23:20,549 --> 01:23:22,425
- He is so excited.
- Hmm!

914
01:23:24,094 --> 01:23:26,054
Oh, he's at the wedding.

915
01:23:26,054 --> 01:23:31,059
Yeah, he's right there.
Right there.

916
01:23:31,059 --> 01:23:33,478
Where did grandpa find Hachi?

917
01:23:34,604 --> 01:23:38,566
<i>Ronnie, actually Hachi found
your grandfather.</i>

918
01:23:38,566 --> 01:23:40,443
<i>How?</i>

919
01:23:40,443 --> 01:23:45,156
<i>One night, your grandfather
was coming back from a trip.</i>

920
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:51,704
<i>Got out of the train station
and on the platform...</i>

921
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:47,152
Hey, wake up.

922
01:25:47,152 --> 01:25:49,655
Hey, boy.

923
01:25:50,781 --> 01:25:54,534
Hey, come on. Let's go!

924
01:26:22,896 --> 01:26:24,564
Hachi!

925
01:26:24,564 --> 01:26:26,858
Hey boy!

926
01:27:09,192 --> 01:27:14,197
I never met my grandfather.
He died when I was just a baby.

927
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:20,495
But when I hear about him and Hachi,
I feel like I know him.

928
01:27:20,495 --> 01:27:24,145
<i>They taught me the
meaning of loyalty, </i>

929
01:27:24,146 --> 01:27:27,794
<i>and you should never forget
anyone that you love.</i>

930
01:27:28,211 --> 01:27:32,590
And that's why Hachi  will
forever be my hero.

931
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,648
Oh, he's happy to see somebody.

932
01:27:51,025 --> 01:27:52,693
Move along.

933
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,532
Come on Hachi, let's go!
