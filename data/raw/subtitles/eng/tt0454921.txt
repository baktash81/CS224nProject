1
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,599
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:40,734
-All right, Dad.
-Come on.

3
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,438
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:40,083
-I think I should make a list.
-What do mean?

5
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,691
-For your birthday gifts?
-Yeah.

6
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:45,419
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,691
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,836
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:55,237
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,034
-I think so.
-All right. That's good.

11
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,881
-How you doing in here, man?
-Okay.

12
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:16,093
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:20,352
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,123
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,900
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,001
Excuse me.

17
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,504
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,974
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:40,542
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,152
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an l.

21
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:48,322
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,853
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,291
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,022
...that when I had children...

25
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,567
...my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,203
This is part of my life story.

27
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:08,377
This part is called "Riding the Bus. "

28
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,513
What's that?

29
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:19,351
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:21,749
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,053
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,457
This machine...

33
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:28,159
...this machine on my lap--

34
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,334
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:33,594
He travels in the past
with this machine and....

36
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:36,034
--it is not a time machine.

37
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:39,201
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:42,672
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,371
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,676
-I appreciate it.
-We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,648
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,981
-Well, maybe next--
-Thank you.

43
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:58,154
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,757
-Hey.
-Hey, baby.

45
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,628
-What happened?
-No, nothing.

46
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,393
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:09,133
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,069
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,443
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,239
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:19,575
-Yes.
-And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:23,311
-What are you gonna do about that?
-Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,823
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,394
That's mine.

55
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,565
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,257
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,369
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,506
-Maybe next quarter.
-It's possible.

59
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:49,904
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:52,146
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,116
...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,918
The problem is...

63
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,321
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,697
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,428
Since birth?

66
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,933
-What's that?
-What?

67
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:23,238
-What is this?
-It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,938
-From who?
-Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,244
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,444
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:35,250
Make every side the same color.

72
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,825
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,258
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:47,198
-You already filed an extension.
-Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:51,268
That's-- It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,607
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:56,177
-And a penalty?
-Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,012
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:06,383
-Come here. Calm down.
-I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:18,027
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:21,671
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:25,603
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:29,007
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,874
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,710
...and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,684
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:40,982
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:44,559
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:48,198
...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,632
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1 957.

91
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:56,398
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:08:56,607 --> 00:09:00,907
... we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:04,070
Twenty years ago, in 1 960...

94
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:08,445
...our federal government payroll
was less than $ 1 3 billion.

95
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,348
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:17,118
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23. 3 percent....

97
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,043
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:41,377
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:45,981
-I'm a stockbroker.
-Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,158
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:52,122
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,729
-That's it.
-Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,991
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,669
-But I need it back for Monday.
-Feed the meter.

105
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:09,244
I still remember that moment.

106
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:18,181
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:27,762
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:46,714
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,045
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:53,519
-For what?
-I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,352
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,885
You know, when l--

113
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:01,724
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:05,265
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,304
What job?

116
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,004
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:18,509
-Stockbroker?
-Yeah.

118
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,907
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,391
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:44,337
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,236
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,144
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:52,543
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,517
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,584
Probably not.

126
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:00,281
We're already two months behind.

127
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:03,517
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:08,124
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:12,832
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:16,734
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:20,170
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:21,742
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,273
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,148
Linda.

135
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:33,246
Linda.

136
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,347
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

137
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:08,688
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:12,760
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,454
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,691
...looking smalltime.

141
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:22,962
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:26,438
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:31,542
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right?

144
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,589
-Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
-Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,123
-Come with me.
-Yes, sir.

146
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:46,091
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:49,527
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,395
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,696
I mean, I'm-- You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:57,840
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so....

151
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,067
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,679
-We....
-Thank you very much.

153
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,042
I need to go.

154
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,345
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:11,713
-Thank you.
-Okay.

156
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:22,589
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,427
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:30,073
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

159
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:37,976
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay--!

160
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,289
Stop! Stop!

161
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:51,689
Don't move!
Stop this--! Stop the train!

162
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:55,027
Stop! Stop!

163
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:13,678
The program took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,977
One got the job.

165
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:22,891
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:27,226
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:35,294
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:48,877
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,520
...made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn...

170
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:54,316
...and try to get
to a solid color on each side.

171
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:58,154
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1 98 1.

172
00:15:58,362 --> 00:15:59,761
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:02,397
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:05,090
... who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,532
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:11,105
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:13,936
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,840
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:18,571
Eat.

180
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:22,151
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, baby.

181
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:25,344
-Come back without that, please.
-Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:28,491
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,126
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,296
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:34,555
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,431
Bye.

187
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:41,229
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:44,566
-Is it an adjective?
-No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,504
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,305
-Is "fuck" spelled right?
-Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:53,642
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,753
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:01,823
-But just don't use that one, okay?
-Okay.

194
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,186
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,496
My nickname.

196
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:08,289
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:11,865
-Oh, yeah? What's it say?
-"Hot Rod."

198
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:16,896
-Did you have a nickname?
-Yep.

199
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,837
-What?
-"Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:22,944
-What's that?
-I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:27,776
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:31,546
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,282
-Hoss wears that hat.
-Hoss?

204
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,287
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:40,254
-How do you know Bonanza?
-We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:44,025
-You watch Bonanza at daycare?
-Yeah.

207
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:47,161
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:51,034
-After snack? After your nap?
-After Love Boat.

209
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:58,107
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:03,410
-Yeah, what'd you put on there?
-A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:11,290
-He says he's been watching TV.
-Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:14,589
-Love Boat?
-For history. Navy.

213
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:17,061
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,394
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:23,972
We're paying you $1 50 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,574
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:30,577
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:37,648
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:42,956
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,627
Bye.

221
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:32,907
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:38,638
...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:42,842
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,611
-Morning, Mr. Twistle.
-Good morning.

225
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,220
-Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
-Hi.

226
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:49,221
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:52,827
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,259
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:58,263
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:01,437
-Yes, sir. You have a great day.
-You too.

231
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,070
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,475
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:14,843
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:18,543
I was wondering if--
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,314
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?

236
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:25,188
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,866
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,340
Hey!

239
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:41,909
This part of my life...

240
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:44,808
-Wait!
-...this part here...

241
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,010
...it's called "Running. "

242
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:50,152
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:51,911
Wait!

244
00:20:52,823 --> 00:20:55,656
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,225
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,487
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,260
Which was unlikely...

248
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:06,128
...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,998
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:15,003
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,579
-Can you feel it, baby?
-Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:19,305
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:22,041
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:26,120
...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:32,194
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:38,366
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:44,240
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,806
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:56,875
Hey, man, l--

260
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:01,054
-Who's he?
-He's that guy....

261
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:15,436
-Did you forget?
-Forget what?

262
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:18,864
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:22,306
-Yeah, I know.
-You have two now.

264
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,213
Hey.

265
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,787
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:48,002
One, two, three!

267
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:52,200
-That's a basketball!
-Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:54,138
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:58,246
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:00,916
-No, it's not.
-There, there.

271
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:04,411
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,697
-That paper's a little heavy, huh?
-Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:28,469
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:31,203
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down--

275
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:33,006
Whatever.

276
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:37,678
-What?
-Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:40,085
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,088
-"Whatever" what?
-Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:44,658
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,159
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:48,797
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,399
-I'm trying to keep a clean house.
-Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:54,365
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:57,904
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,911
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

286
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:08,107
-So you don't trust me now?
-Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,529
-Taxi!
-Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:28,397
-Yeah, hi.
-Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,436
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,700
I submitted an application for the
intern program about a month ago...

291
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,140
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly--

292
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:38,314
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:41,814
-Take care of yourself.
-Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:44,384
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:46,316
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:49,985
-All right, get in.
-All right.

297
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,829
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:01,868
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:06,702
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,468
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:13,945
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and....

302
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:18,251
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important--

303
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,852
-I can do it.
-No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:27,723
-That's bullshit.
-No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:31,361
-No, you can't.
-Let me see it.

307
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:33,163
Give it here.

308
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:40,439
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:42,167
Sorry.

310
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:48,673
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the center pieces never move.

311
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:51,979
So if it's yellow in the center,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:54,679
If it's red in the center,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:58,520
-Okay.
-So.... You can slow down.

314
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:01,788
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,693
-Yeah, I can.
-No, you can't.

316
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,060
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

317
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:07,202
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:11,369
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:26,552
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:28,624
Holy cow.

321
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:42,635
-You almost had that one.
-I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,943
Look at that.

323
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:16,433
You're almost there.

324
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:43,860
-1 7.1 0.
-This is me.

325
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:47,401
Good job.

326
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:52,333
-Goodbye.
-Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,473
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,671
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,749
Two-- A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:08,355
-Just flip around.
-Okay.

331
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,030
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:54,961
-Where are you going? Come here!
-No!

333
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:58,004
-No, no, no!
-You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:58,207 --> 00:28:59,538
-Give me my money.
-Please stop.

335
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,733
-Please, please, please!
-Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:04,504
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:06,238
-Come here!
-I'm sorry.

338
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,144
-I'm so sorry.
-I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:11,781
-I'm sorry!
-Idiot.

340
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:23,929
I'll get you!

341
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:27,625
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,112
Hey!

343
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:48,222
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:50,584
Stop him!

345
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:56,521
Stop him!

346
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:03,466
The doors are closing.

347
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:06,506
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,578
No! No! No!

349
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:22,053
No!

350
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:47,580
-Hello?
-Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,479
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:53,917
-Chris, I missed my shift.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:57,422
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:59,993
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:02,187
-What?
-Did you hear what I said?

356
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:07,001
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:08,727
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,504
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:14,233
-Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--
-I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:23,374
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:27,155
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:33,451
...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:35,494
And I remember thinking:

364
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:40,067
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:44,968
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:48,200
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:50,205
...no matter what.

368
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:52,108
How did he know that?

369
00:31:57,353 --> 00:32:00,151
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,784
-Hello?
-Chris.

371
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:37,619
-Who is this?
-Jay Twistle.

372
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:40,292
-Hey.
-Dean Witter.

373
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:43,192
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,867
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:47,330
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:50,438
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,406
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,168
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:01,912
-Hold on one second.
-All right.

380
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:07,915
Hello?

381
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:10,456
-Chris?
-Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,288
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:15,555
-She can give you all the specifics.
-Yep.

384
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,630
-Okay, 41 5.
-41 5.

385
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,528
-864.
-864.

386
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:21,760
-0256.
-0256.

387
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:24,963
-Yeah, extension 4796.
-4796.

388
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:29,440
-Right. Call her tomorrow.
-Yes, sir. 41 5-864-0256.

389
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:30,942
-Okay, buddy.
-All right, yes.

390
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:33,308
-Thank you very much.
-We'll see you soon.

391
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:37,246
864-0256.

392
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:40,650
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:45,524
-Chris.
-Hey.

394
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,992
Did you--? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:50,097
-No. You catch the game last night?
-No, no.

396
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,664
You didn't see that, 1 1 8, 1 --?

397
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:54,062
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,933
-No, I haven't see them.
-1 1 9-1 20. Double overtime.

399
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,267
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 1 7 seconds left.

400
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:02,068
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:04,405
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:07,242
-What's your problem with numbers?
-864-2....

403
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,384
-And you owe me money.
-Yeah.

404
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:11,348
You owe me $1 4.

405
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:13,419
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,758
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,953
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,620
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,122
-You hear me?
-Leave me alone!

410
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:53,158
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,125
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:58,630
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,358
-Do you wanna leave?
-Yeah.

414
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:03,402
-You wanna leave?
-Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,505
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,234
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:11,743
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:15,041
-You are so weak.
-No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:17,845
-I'm just not happy!
-Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:18,054 --> 00:35:19,419
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,820
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:23,821
-Stop!
-Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:26,526
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:55,623
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:58,157
-How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
-Hi.

426
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:04,391
-Where's Mom?
-Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,058
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,295
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,070
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:23,712
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,046
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:28,917
-Yeah.
-All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,583
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,319
-Yeah.
-All right.

435
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,555
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:41,430
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:57,546
Christopher.

438
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:17,937
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,573
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:22,175
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:25,404
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:27,172
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:30,784
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:34,315
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:35,717
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:38,223
-All right, look. I need more time.
-No.

447
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:40,554
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:46,133
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some
more time-- I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:55,808
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:49,323
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:52,629
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:56,703
-Payable to the City of San Francisco.
-Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:56,906 --> 00:39:00,398
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,076
This is all I got.

455
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:10,245
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,812
-What?
-You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,549
No.

458
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,557
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:22,356
-I have to pick up my son.
-You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:27,194
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 1 0:1 5 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:29,098
-I cannot stay--
-9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:31,637
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,308
-Is there anyone else who can--?
-I take care of him.

464
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,536
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:45,280
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:50,721
-Hello.
-Hey.

467
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:52,655
What do you want?

468
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:58,426
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:03,264
Just keep him for the night and I'm--
And-- Just one night.

470
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:05,531
What happened?

471
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:09,199
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:11,174
I'm gonna go right--
You can just--

473
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,678
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:17,452
-No.
-Come on, Linda.

475
00:40:17,653 --> 00:40:21,919
-Why you doing that?
-No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:26,454
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,857
-How is he?
-He's fine.

478
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:33,125
All right, just-- All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:37,135
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:40,308
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,176
Okay?

482
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:44,903
Linda?

483
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:47,014
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:51,045
All right, all right.

485
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:53,118
Thank you.

486
00:40:55,557 --> 00:40:57,047
Bye.

487
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,579
I'm okay?

488
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,647
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,657
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,097
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:22,075
This way.

492
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:26,338
It'll be right this way.

493
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:39,860
What is the word on that one?

494
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:03,382
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:07,615
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,047
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:14,528
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,698
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,426
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:22,194
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:26,670
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:30,902
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:35,948
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:40,850
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:42,024 --> 00:43:43,787
So the truth is...

506
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:46,620
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:48,693
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:52,759
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:54,959
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,196
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,568
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,504
I hope so.

513
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:04,440
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:04,646 --> 00:44:07,012
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:09,343
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:12,952
-He said you're smart.
-Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:16,147
-And you want to learn this business?
-Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:18,383
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:20,255
Absolutely.

520
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:22,793
-Jay?
-Yes, sir.

521
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:25,091
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,962
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,936
-Was he ever dressed like this?
-No.

524
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,334
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:35,244 --> 00:44:38,145
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:40,178
-High school?
-Yes, sir.

527
00:44:40,616 --> 00:44:43,608
-How many in the class?
-Twelve.

528
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:45,548
It was a small town.

529
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:49,355
-I'll say.
-But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:52,823
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:55,297 --> 00:44:57,128
Can I say something?

532
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,995
I'm the type of person...

533
00:45:00,202 --> 00:45:03,467
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:05,936
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:07,472
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:12,670
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:15,611
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:18,046
Chris.

539
00:45:19,388 --> 00:45:23,119
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:25,316
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:28,462
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:35,795
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:54,046
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:54,256 --> 00:45:56,520
-...but you pulled it off.
-Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:56,725 --> 00:45:59,125
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:02,253
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:05,363
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,535
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime--

549
00:46:07,736 --> 00:46:09,863
What are you talking--?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:12,836
-You stood here--
-Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,406
-No.
-I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,201
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:16,745 --> 00:46:20,442
-...and I need to be certain that I'll be--
-All right. Okay.

554
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:25,177
Tonight.

555
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:28,879
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:32,083
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:35,263
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.

558
00:46:35,564 --> 00:46:38,965
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:41,837 --> 00:46:44,431
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:47,032
Tonight.

561
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:57,285
There was no salary.

562
00:46:57,486 --> 00:47:00,649
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:11,959
One intern was hired at the end
of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,597
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:16,168
...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:18,202
... to another brokerage.

567
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:22,869
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:47:23,078 --> 00:47:27,014
... would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:31,674
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:21,798
-I got him. I got him.
-He's asleep.

571
00:48:22,003 --> 00:48:23,527
All right.

572
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,811
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:46,122
I got it.

574
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,158
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:24,929
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,992
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:32,262
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:37,143
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:46,918
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:49,215
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:51,289
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,526
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:02,437 --> 00:50:03,961
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:11,702
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:11,913 --> 00:50:13,380
...and I got it.

586
00:50:13,582 --> 00:50:16,142
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

587
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:19,945
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:22,089
No, it's not.

589
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:25,920
I gotta go.

590
00:50:59,494 --> 00:51:01,860
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:04,089
And....

592
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:12,370
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:14,269
I know that.

594
00:51:55,884 --> 00:51:58,614
-Dean Witter.
-Yes, hi.

595
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,651
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:06,418
-Your name?
-Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:06,628 --> 00:52:07,754
The message is:

598
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:13,628
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the program.

599
00:52:13,835 --> 00:52:19,705
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:21,773
Is that all?

601
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:23,601
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:25,575
-Okay.
-Thank you.

603
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,338
Bye.

604
00:52:53,942 --> 00:52:55,239
-Be careful with that.
-What?

605
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:58,207
Be care-- Go ahead.

606
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,005
-Are we there?
-Yep.

607
00:53:38,286 --> 00:53:40,846
-Hey, you know what today is?
-Yeah.

608
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:42,716
-What?
-Saturday.

609
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:45,222
-You know what Saturday is, right?
-Yeah.

610
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:47,860
-What?
-Basketball.

611
00:53:48,062 --> 00:53:50,963
-You wanna go play some basketball?
-Okay.

612
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,726
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:53,935 --> 00:53:58,201
-How about that? Wanna do that?
-No.

614
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:01,807
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,479
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:06,748 --> 00:54:08,113
Okay.

617
00:54:08,316 --> 00:54:11,114
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:14,083
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:17,383
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:21,388
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:24,224
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:24,432 --> 00:54:27,299
...I really-- You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:27,502 --> 00:54:29,936
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:31,662
-All right?
-All right.

625
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:33,704
Okay.

626
00:54:34,843 --> 00:54:36,470
All right, go ahead.

627
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:01,928
Hey.

628
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:07,438
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:10,202
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:13,005
Not even me.

631
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:17,546
-All right?
-All right.

632
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:20,414
You got a dream...

633
00:55:20,622 --> 00:55:22,852
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,619
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:28,261
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,400
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:44,445 --> 00:55:46,003
Let's go.

638
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,017
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:49,017 --> 00:55:51,645
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:55:51,853 --> 00:55:54,321
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

641
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,616
-You gotta trust me, all right?
-I trust you.

642
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:01,556
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:05,766
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:06,301 --> 00:56:08,496
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

645
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,933
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:13,206
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:56:13,408 --> 00:56:16,866
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

648
00:56:17,078 --> 00:56:19,546
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

649
00:56:19,747 --> 00:56:22,079
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

650
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:25,480
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,053
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

652
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,383
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

653
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,822
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

654
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:37,520
And God said, "l sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:40,266
Do you like it?

656
00:56:40,468 --> 00:56:43,198
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

657
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,871
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Yes, sir.

658
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,706
-You got the bill of sale here.
-Yes.

659
00:56:52,914 --> 00:56:54,313
All the information you'll need.

660
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:56,142
Thank you very much
for your business.

661
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:57,841
Thank you.

662
00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:03,285
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:05,118
...7, 8, 9, 1 0.

664
00:57:05,727 --> 00:57:06,819
Thank you.

665
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:12,098
-Hey, you want one of those?
-No, it's okay.

666
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,598
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

667
00:57:15,503 --> 00:57:19,030
-You like that one? How much?
-Twenty-five cents.

668
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:36,951
This part of my life
is called "Internship. "

669
00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:40,376
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

670
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:42,843
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

671
00:57:43,048 --> 00:57:44,948
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

672
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,981
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

673
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:50,314
...from every Fortune 500 company
in the financial district.

674
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:53,319
You will be pooling
from 60 Fortune companies.

675
00:57:53,525 --> 00:57:56,289
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

676
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:59,487
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

677
00:57:59,698 --> 00:58:02,963
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

678
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:06,103
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

679
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:11,242
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

680
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:13,536
...we'll cook the fish.

681
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:16,371
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

682
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:18,982
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

683
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:21,742
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

684
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:24,149
That person's gonna be the guy...

685
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:26,620
...who can turn this into this.

686
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:29,885
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

687
00:58:30,429 --> 00:58:32,260
You, you, help me hand these out.

688
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:36,158
This is going to be your bible.

689
00:58:36,368 --> 00:58:37,699
You'll eat with it.

690
00:58:37,903 --> 00:58:39,598
-You'll drink with it.
-It was simple.

691
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:42,774
X number of calls
equals X number of prospects.

692
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:45,944
X number of prospects
equals X number of customers.

693
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:49,305
X number of customers
equals X number of dollars...

694
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:51,676
-...in the company's pocket.
-Your board exam.

695
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:57,754
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

696
00:58:57,957 --> 00:59:01,324
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass/fail.

697
00:59:01,527 --> 00:59:04,928
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

698
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,496
Be safe, score a hundred.

699
00:59:08,467 --> 00:59:11,630
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 1 0.

700
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:23,848
-Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
-Hi.

701
00:59:24,049 --> 00:59:26,244
-Chris, how are you?
-I'm good. How you doing?

702
00:59:26,452 --> 00:59:30,548
-Fine, thank you for asking.
-First day in there. It was exciting.

703
00:59:30,756 --> 00:59:32,849
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

704
00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:34,889
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

705
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:37,892
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

706
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:39,792
Oh, man, I remember mine.

707
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:42,524
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

708
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:45,135
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

709
00:59:45,337 --> 00:59:48,738
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

710
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:51,102
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

711
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,676
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so--

712
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:56,211
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

713
00:59:56,415 --> 00:59:59,213
-No, go ahead.
-Good talking to you, sir.

714
01:00:28,714 --> 01:00:32,650
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

715
01:00:32,951 --> 01:00:35,818
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

716
01:00:36,021 --> 01:00:38,216
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

717
01:00:38,424 --> 01:00:40,688
I'm trying to cross the street.

718
01:00:40,893 --> 01:00:44,351
-Well, you're all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

719
01:00:44,696 --> 01:00:46,254
-Where's my shoe?
-What?

720
01:00:46,465 --> 01:00:50,265
-You knocked off my shoe!
-I don't know where your shoe is.

721
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:54,604
-Where's my damn shoe?
-I don't know.

722
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:01,879
Hey.

723
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:06,046
-Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
-No, I'm sorry.

724
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:09,618
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

725
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:12,723
-We should wait for the police.
-I gotta go to work.

726
01:01:13,425 --> 01:01:17,156
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

727
01:01:17,496 --> 01:01:21,023
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

728
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,271
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

729
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:37,540
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

730
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:44,787
Dad.

731
01:01:45,324 --> 01:01:48,316
-You don't have a shoe.
-Yeah, I know.

732
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:51,587
-Wanna know what happened?
-Yeah.

733
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:53,821
I got hit by a car.

734
01:01:54,032 --> 01:01:56,694
-You got hit by a car?
-Yep.

735
01:01:56,902 --> 01:02:00,531
-Where?
-Just right by the office.

736
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:03,799
-No, where in your body?
-Like, the back of my legs.

737
01:02:04,009 --> 01:02:05,840
-Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
-Goodbye.

738
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:09,207
-Where you on the street?
-Yeah, I was running in the street.

739
01:02:09,414 --> 01:02:12,315
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

740
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:14,516
Yeah, thanks.

741
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,449
I'll remember that next time.

742
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:20,156
And here I was again.

743
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:22,953
-Show up early.
-While qualified persons...

744
01:02:23,228 --> 01:02:27,096
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

745
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:29,199
-Now, Chris.
-Yes, sir.

746
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:31,426
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

747
01:02:31,637 --> 01:02:35,539
Favors for Frakesh,
our office manager. All day.

748
01:02:35,741 --> 01:02:38,301
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

749
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:40,944
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

750
01:02:41,146 --> 01:02:44,047
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

751
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:45,580
Okay, yes, thank you.

752
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:47,149
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

753
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:51,083
-Chris?
-Yes, sir.

754
01:02:52,457 --> 01:02:55,620
Feeling underrated
and unappreciated.

755
01:02:55,928 --> 01:02:57,452
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

756
01:02:57,663 --> 01:02:59,961
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

757
01:03:00,165 --> 01:03:01,530
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

758
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:04,930
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax--

759
01:03:05,137 --> 01:03:07,401
Okay, thank you, sir.

760
01:03:08,507 --> 01:03:13,206
Then catch the bus by 4 to the place
where they can't spell "happiness. "

761
01:03:13,412 --> 01:03:15,175
Then the cross-town.

762
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:17,544
The 22 home.

763
01:03:18,817 --> 01:03:21,445
-Hey, Chris!
-Hey. Hi, Ralph.

764
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:24,554
-I'm waiting.
-All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

765
01:03:24,756 --> 01:03:26,815
I'm gonna get that for you.

766
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,436
Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.

767
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:40,730
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

768
01:03:40,939 --> 01:03:43,999
We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.

769
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:46,507
-From the bottom to the top.
-Yes, sir.

770
01:03:46,712 --> 01:03:49,408
-From the doorman to the CEO.
-Okay.

771
01:03:50,182 --> 01:03:52,810
They'd stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.

772
01:03:53,018 --> 01:03:56,044
I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.

773
01:03:56,255 --> 01:03:59,383
Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

774
01:03:59,591 --> 01:04:01,183
In order not to waste any time...

775
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,588
...I wasn't hanging up the phone
in between calls.

776
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:05,854
Okay, thank you very much.

777
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:09,627
I realized that
by not hanging up the phone...

778
01:04:09,835 --> 01:04:11,803
...I gained another eight minutes
a day.

779
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:14,234
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

780
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:16,964
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.
-I wasn't drinking water...

781
01:04:17,175 --> 01:04:19,200
...so I didn't' waste any time
in the bathroom.

782
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:21,606
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity--

783
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:24,873
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

784
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,414
But even doing all this...

785
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:30,714
...after two months, I still didn't have
time to work my way up a sheet.

786
01:04:43,935 --> 01:04:46,460
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

787
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:47,866
Walter Ribbon's office.

788
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:51,269
Yes, hello, my name is Chris Gardner.
I'm calling for Mr. Walter Ribbon.

789
01:04:51,476 --> 01:04:52,636
-Concerning?
-Yes, ma'am.

790
01:04:52,844 --> 01:04:54,175
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

791
01:04:54,379 --> 01:04:56,074
Just a moment.

792
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,712
-Hello?
-Mr. Ribbon.

793
01:04:59,918 --> 01:05:02,887
Hello, sir. My name's Chris Gardner.
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

794
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:04,817
-Yeah, Chris.
-Yes, Mr. Ribbon...

795
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,424
...I would love to have the opportunity
to discuss some of our products.

796
01:05:08,627 --> 01:05:11,061
I'm certain that I could
be of some assistance to you.

797
01:05:11,263 --> 01:05:13,094
Can you be here in 20 minutes?

798
01:05:14,399 --> 01:05:17,334
-Twenty minutes. Absolutely.
-Just had someone cancel.

799
01:05:17,536 --> 01:05:19,629
I can give you a few minutes
before the 49ers.

800
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:22,966
-Monday Night Football, buddy.
-Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

801
01:05:23,175 --> 01:05:25,473
-See you soon.
-Bye-bye.

802
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:30,206
Excuse me. Thank you.

803
01:05:30,415 --> 01:05:31,973
-Chris, what's up?
-Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

804
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:33,481
Hey, do you have five minutes?

805
01:05:33,685 --> 01:05:35,380
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon--

806
01:05:35,587 --> 01:05:38,647
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

807
01:05:38,857 --> 01:05:42,122
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

808
01:05:42,327 --> 01:05:45,524
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

809
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:48,291
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

810
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,990
And you have to jimmy that.

811
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:52,193
-Jimmy what?
-You have to jimmy the key.

812
01:05:52,404 --> 01:05:57,068
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

813
01:06:13,258 --> 01:06:14,987
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

814
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,663
Oh, no!

815
01:06:20,999 --> 01:06:22,432
Come on.

816
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,505
-Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
-Thank you.

817
01:06:42,454 --> 01:06:45,218
-Thanks a lot.
-Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

818
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:52,497
No, no, no!

819
01:07:02,607 --> 01:07:05,371
Rachel, get Ristuccia on the phone
for me, please.

820
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:55,019
-Hi.
-Hi.

821
01:07:55,227 --> 01:07:57,821
I'm Chris Gardner. I have
an appointment with Mr. Ribbon.

822
01:07:58,029 --> 01:07:59,428
Oh, you just missed him.

823
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:03,557
Thank you.

824
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:31,561
-What's that?
-Just filling out a check...

825
01:08:31,763 --> 01:08:34,254
...paying some bills...

826
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:36,491
...and a parking ticket.

827
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,429
We don't have a car anymore.

828
01:08:40,639 --> 01:08:42,869
Yep, I know.

829
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:49,438
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

830
01:08:49,648 --> 01:08:51,912
A couple of doctors' offices.

831
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:56,218
-On sales calls, okay?
-Okay.

832
01:08:59,124 --> 01:09:03,117
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

833
01:09:03,328 --> 01:09:06,161
-Really?
-Possibly.

834
01:09:06,598 --> 01:09:09,032
-All right?
-All right.

835
01:09:09,234 --> 01:09:11,327
Come on, finish up.

836
01:09:11,836 --> 01:09:14,805
-Are you sure?
-Possibly.

837
01:09:16,007 --> 01:09:17,599
Really?

838
01:09:47,539 --> 01:09:52,067
-Are you bringing it to the game?
-Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

839
01:09:52,277 --> 01:09:55,246
And maybe
we're going to the game.

840
01:09:56,748 --> 01:10:00,707
-Where are we going now?
-To see someone about my job.

841
01:10:01,086 --> 01:10:02,781
I don't understand.

842
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:06,185
-You don't understand what?
-Are we going to the game?

843
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:08,916
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

844
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:11,493
-You know what "possibly" means?
-Like probably.

845
01:10:11,696 --> 01:10:14,324
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

846
01:10:14,532 --> 01:10:17,262
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

847
01:10:17,469 --> 01:10:20,529
-What does "probably" mean?
-It means we have a good chance.

848
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:22,104
And what does "possibly" mean?

849
01:10:22,307 --> 01:10:24,775
-I know what it means.
-What does it mean?

850
01:10:24,976 --> 01:10:27,536
It means that we're not going
to the game.

851
01:10:29,214 --> 01:10:32,479
-How did you get so smart?
-Because you're smart.

852
01:10:37,555 --> 01:10:40,319
-Are we there?
-Yeah.

853
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,388
-Mr. Ribbon.
-Yes?

854
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:50,500
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

855
01:10:51,036 --> 01:10:53,470
-Oh, hi. Hi.
-This is my son, Christopher.

856
01:10:53,672 --> 01:10:55,196
-Hi.
-Hey, Christopher.

857
01:10:55,407 --> 01:10:57,807
-What are you doing up here?
-I came to apologize...

858
01:10:58,009 --> 01:11:00,671
-...for missing our appointment.
-You didn't need to come up.

859
01:11:00,879 --> 01:11:03,473
We were in the neighborhood
visiting a very close friend...

860
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:07,209
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

861
01:11:07,419 --> 01:11:10,252
-I know you probably waited for me.
-Little bit.

862
01:11:10,455 --> 01:11:12,980
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

863
01:11:13,191 --> 01:11:15,250
Oh, come on. What's that?

864
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,918
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

865
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:22,665
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

866
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:25,529
-I have a meeting after the game.
-You're going to the game?

867
01:11:25,737 --> 01:11:27,500
-Yeah.
-Possibly.

868
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,905
-Possibly.
-We're going too.

869
01:11:30,108 --> 01:11:31,769
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 1 2-year-old.

870
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:33,102
We were just leaving. Tim!

871
01:11:33,378 --> 01:11:35,312
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

872
01:11:35,513 --> 01:11:38,243
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

873
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,509
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

874
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,243
-You got it.
-Thank you very much.

875
01:11:42,454 --> 01:11:44,115
You take care. Here, come on.

876
01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:45,653
-Say bye-bye, Chris.
-Bye.

877
01:11:45,857 --> 01:11:47,484
Bye, Christopher.

878
01:11:47,692 --> 01:11:49,216
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

879
01:11:49,427 --> 01:11:52,362
-What--? To Candlestick?
-We're going now. Come with us.

880
01:11:52,564 --> 01:11:55,727
-Where are your seats?
-We've-- We're upper deck.

881
01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:57,162
We got a box. Come on.

882
01:11:57,368 --> 01:11:59,529
-You wanna sit in the box?
-No.

883
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:04,664
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

884
01:12:04,876 --> 01:12:07,344
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

885
01:12:08,012 --> 01:12:11,743
-Okay.
-Okay, kids in the back.

886
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,580
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

887
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:20,224
-Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
-We don't have a car.

888
01:12:21,126 --> 01:12:23,321
-Oh, my--
-What happened?

889
01:12:23,528 --> 01:12:24,893
I think I got stung by a bee.

890
01:12:25,096 --> 01:12:28,031
-You all right?
-Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

891
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:30,827
-You're not allergic or anything?
-No, no, no.

892
01:12:31,035 --> 01:12:34,368
-Where'd he get you?
-Just right at the back of my head.

893
01:12:34,572 --> 01:12:37,006
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

894
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:39,335
-Does it hurt?
-Christopher, I'm fine.

895
01:12:39,544 --> 01:12:43,412
-Let me see.
-Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

896
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:45,981
Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times...

897
01:12:46,184 --> 01:12:48,982
...in the Declaration
of Independence.

898
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,980
May seem like a strange word
to be in that document...

899
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:57,127
...but he was sort of....
He was an artist.

900
01:12:57,362 --> 01:13:01,924
He called the English
"the disturbers of our harmony. "

901
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,996
And I remember standing there
that day...

902
01:13:04,202 --> 01:13:06,500
... thinking about
the disturbers of mine.

903
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:10,970
Questions I had:
Whether all this was good.

904
01:13:11,342 --> 01:13:13,105
Whether I'd make it.

905
01:13:16,114 --> 01:13:19,106
And Walter Ribbon
and his Pacific Bell pension money...

906
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:20,682
... which was millions.

907
01:13:20,885 --> 01:13:22,512
Yeah!

908
01:13:22,954 --> 01:13:25,889
It was a way to another place.

909
01:13:26,624 --> 01:13:28,751
Wow, this is....

910
01:13:29,127 --> 01:13:31,095
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

911
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:34,390
-Thank you very much for this, really.
-Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

912
01:13:34,599 --> 01:13:37,864
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

913
01:13:38,069 --> 01:13:40,936
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

914
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:43,400
...which we believe
to be far superior...

915
01:13:43,608 --> 01:13:46,202
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

916
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:48,242
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

917
01:13:48,746 --> 01:13:53,479
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

918
01:13:53,685 --> 01:13:56,245
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

919
01:13:56,454 --> 01:13:59,912
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

920
01:14:00,124 --> 01:14:02,217
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

921
01:14:02,427 --> 01:14:05,555
So, you know, come on, relax.
Let's play the game. Go, go, go!

922
01:14:06,497 --> 01:14:07,794
Yes!

923
01:14:10,802 --> 01:14:12,861
Yes! Yeah!

924
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:18,600
-Here you go.
-All right.

925
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,573
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

926
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:23,338
-Chris, I'll talk to you later.
-I'm gonna give you a call.

927
01:14:23,548 --> 01:14:25,243
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

928
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,042
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

929
01:14:33,858 --> 01:14:36,622
-Bye.
-Bye, Christopher.

930
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:10,652
After four months, we had sold
all our scanners.

931
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,329
It seemed we were making it.

932
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:15,494
What's the...

933
01:15:15,867 --> 01:15:18,358
-...fastest animal in the world?
-Jackrabbit.

934
01:15:20,571 --> 01:15:24,007
It seemed we were doing good.

935
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:25,971
Till one day...

936
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,905
...that day...

937
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:30,413
...that letter brought me
back to earth.

938
01:15:37,789 --> 01:15:40,383
This part of my life is called
"Paying Taxes. "

939
01:15:42,427 --> 01:15:43,758
If you didn't pay them...

940
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:46,897
... the government could stick
their hands into your bank account...

941
01:15:47,565 --> 01:15:48,793
...and take your money.

942
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,967
Dad.

943
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:52,159
No warning. Nothing.

944
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:55,498
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

945
01:15:55,707 --> 01:15:58,835
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

946
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:00,440
I was-- I was--

947
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:03,978
Listen, l--
That's all the money that I have.

948
01:16:04,182 --> 01:16:08,482
You cannot go into my bank acc--
No--

949
01:16:08,686 --> 01:16:11,052
It was the 25th of September.

950
01:16:11,255 --> 01:16:12,950
I remember that day.

951
01:16:13,157 --> 01:16:15,250
Because that's the day
that I found out...

952
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:20,591
...there was only 21 dollars
and 33 cents left in my bank account.

953
01:16:20,798 --> 01:16:22,493
I was broke.

954
01:16:32,844 --> 01:16:35,176
-Dressed yet?
-No.

955
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:42,383
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

956
01:16:42,587 --> 01:16:45,351
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

957
01:16:45,556 --> 01:16:49,117
-I need that money now, not later.
-When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

958
01:16:49,327 --> 01:16:51,227
Now!

959
01:16:54,866 --> 01:16:56,959
Hey, what's happening, man?

960
01:16:57,201 --> 01:17:00,068
Wayne, I need to get
that $1 4 from you.

961
01:17:01,739 --> 01:17:03,604
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

962
01:17:03,808 --> 01:17:06,868
-What? Why?
-Why what?

963
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:09,444
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

964
01:17:09,647 --> 01:17:11,615
I helped you move.

965
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:16,752
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

966
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:18,717
That's 200 yards.

967
01:17:18,923 --> 01:17:20,857
It's been four months, Wayne.

968
01:17:21,059 --> 01:17:24,654
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

969
01:17:24,862 --> 01:17:27,194
-I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
-Go get my money.

970
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:29,628
-Wayne, get my mo--
-I really don't, man. It's $1 4.

971
01:17:29,834 --> 01:17:31,529
It's my $1 4!
Go get my money!

972
01:17:31,736 --> 01:17:34,296
-All of this for $1 4.
-Get my money, Wayne.

973
01:17:52,657 --> 01:17:54,818
Dad, look at me!

974
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:56,988
Dad.

975
01:17:57,995 --> 01:18:01,522
-Should I go?
-Sure, man. Why not?

976
01:18:17,582 --> 01:18:18,640
-Stay here.
-Dad, look.

977
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,442
-No, no. Stay right here.
-Dad.

978
01:18:20,651 --> 01:18:23,415
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

979
01:18:28,526 --> 01:18:32,018
-Dad, where you going?
-Hey, what did I say?

980
01:18:35,066 --> 01:18:36,693
Dad!

981
01:18:36,901 --> 01:18:40,302
Dad, wait! Dad!

982
01:18:48,446 --> 01:18:50,505
-Dad.
-I gotta--

983
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:54,082
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

984
01:18:54,285 --> 01:18:58,585
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

985
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:04,355
Bring back my time machine!

986
01:19:05,696 --> 01:19:07,357
Bring my time machine back!

987
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,835
-Dad, where are we going?
-Just be quiet.

988
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:23,174
Go get your things. Go.

989
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,065
-Chris?
-Yes.

990
01:19:48,272 --> 01:19:52,174
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

991
01:20:03,354 --> 01:20:05,822
Where are we going now?

992
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:09,856
Gotta-- We gotta
see somebody else.

993
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:14,090
I'm tired.

994
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,727
I know.

995
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:29,205
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

996
01:20:29,647 --> 01:20:31,945
-I have to go now, Chris.
-No, no, no.

997
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:36,017
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

998
01:20:37,822 --> 01:20:40,120
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

999
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:43,157
-No, no. I have to fix it now.
-No.

1000
01:20:43,361 --> 01:20:48,594
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1001
01:20:48,799 --> 01:20:50,926
I really have to go, Chris.

1002
01:20:52,136 --> 01:20:53,831
Thank you. Thank you.

1003
01:20:54,038 --> 01:20:55,903
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1004
01:20:56,107 --> 01:20:57,802
I'll see you soon.

1005
01:21:49,794 --> 01:21:52,228
Why are our things here?

1006
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:54,857
Dad.

1007
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:40,105
-Let's go. Come on.
-Where?

1008
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:44,044
-Just out of here.
-Why?

1009
01:22:44,248 --> 01:22:47,240
-We can't stay here tonight.
-Yes, we can. Open the door!

1010
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:50,420
-Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
-Open the door!

1011
01:22:52,123 --> 01:22:55,991
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1012
01:22:56,193 --> 01:22:57,683
Stop it.

1013
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:03,389
Come on.

1014
01:23:12,476 --> 01:23:13,966
Come on.

1015
01:23:30,961 --> 01:23:32,622
Wayne!

1016
01:23:33,697 --> 01:23:35,597
Wayne!

1017
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:45,105
Wayne!

1018
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:04,355
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1019
01:24:20,211 --> 01:24:22,236
Where are we going?

1020
01:24:24,415 --> 01:24:27,748
-Dad, where are we going?
-I don't know.

1021
01:24:43,234 --> 01:24:45,634
It's not a time machine.

1022
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:47,269
Dad.

1023
01:24:47,638 --> 01:24:48,969
It's not a time machine.

1024
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:52,438
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1025
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:55,209
-What guy?
-The guy. He was at the park.

1026
01:24:55,446 --> 01:24:57,346
He said it was a time machine.

1027
01:25:03,654 --> 01:25:04,916
Yes, it is.

1028
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,287
No, it's not.

1029
01:25:10,294 --> 01:25:12,262
-It is.
-No, it's not.

1030
01:25:18,469 --> 01:25:22,997
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1031
01:25:26,176 --> 01:25:27,336
Wanna push it?

1032
01:25:31,849 --> 01:25:33,510
Okay.

1033
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:36,643
Come on.

1034
01:25:38,155 --> 01:25:39,782
Come on, man.

1035
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:46,520
Right here.

1036
01:25:46,931 --> 01:25:48,523
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1037
01:25:48,866 --> 01:25:50,891
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1038
01:25:51,435 --> 01:25:52,663
You gotta close your eyes.

1039
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,835
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1040
01:25:57,007 --> 01:25:59,441
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1041
01:26:05,215 --> 01:26:07,046
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1042
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:09,946
It takes a few seconds.

1043
01:26:12,356 --> 01:26:14,256
Oh, my goodness.

1044
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:16,653
Open, open, open!

1045
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:22,692
-What is it?
-Dinosaurs.

1046
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,095
-Where?
-You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1047
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:30,133
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1048
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,275
-Can you see them?
-Yeah.

1049
01:26:34,478 --> 01:26:35,877
Wait. Come on, come on.

1050
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,411
-Wait, watch out.
-What is it?

1051
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:39,674
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1052
01:26:40,017 --> 01:26:42,281
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1053
01:26:42,486 --> 01:26:43,885
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1054
01:26:44,588 --> 01:26:46,954
-Watch out!
-Whoa! Oh, my good-- A T. rex.

1055
01:26:47,157 --> 01:26:50,786
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1056
01:26:51,762 --> 01:26:54,856
-We gotta find someplace safe.
-Like what?

1057
01:26:55,065 --> 01:26:57,033
We need a cave.

1058
01:26:57,234 --> 01:26:58,326
A cave?

1059
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:00,560
-We gotta find a cave. Come on.
-Okay.

1060
01:27:00,771 --> 01:27:02,534
Come on, come on.

1061
01:27:04,108 --> 01:27:05,507
Watch your back! Look out.

1062
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:07,734
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1063
01:27:07,945 --> 01:27:10,846
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1064
01:27:11,048 --> 01:27:12,276
Go ahead. Get in.

1065
01:27:12,483 --> 01:27:14,348
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1066
01:27:17,955 --> 01:27:21,721
-Are we safe?
-Yeah, I think so.

1067
01:28:29,693 --> 01:28:31,320
Hey.

1068
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:34,557
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing good.

1069
01:28:34,765 --> 01:28:36,198
How are you getting along?

1070
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,595
-Good. I'm good.
-You doing good?

1071
01:28:38,802 --> 01:28:41,327
-How you doing?
-I'm doing great.

1072
01:28:42,473 --> 01:28:44,100
Where you going?

1073
01:28:47,377 --> 01:28:50,403
I-- Sacramento.

1074
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:53,709
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from--

1075
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,545
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over--

1076
01:28:56,754 --> 01:28:58,016
Get them over to us.

1077
01:28:58,222 --> 01:28:59,951
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1078
01:29:00,157 --> 01:29:01,988
Awesome.

1079
01:29:02,192 --> 01:29:04,160
Hey, let them win a round.

1080
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,324
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1081
01:29:11,535 --> 01:29:14,629
-Where?
-He's outside. Please come with me.

1082
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:24,037
Hi.

1083
01:29:27,384 --> 01:29:29,909
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1084
01:29:32,156 --> 01:29:33,783
We need a room.

1085
01:29:34,391 --> 01:29:37,360
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1086
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:40,189
-There's just some glass work.
-Let me stop you right there.

1087
01:29:40,397 --> 01:29:42,865
-I wish I could help you--
-This is my son, Christopher.

1088
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,191
-He's 5 years old.
-Hi, baby.

1089
01:29:45,402 --> 01:29:48,462
-We need some place to stay.
-Okay, and I would love to help you...

1090
01:29:48,672 --> 01:29:51,539
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1091
01:29:51,742 --> 01:29:54,802
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1092
01:29:55,012 --> 01:29:56,411
We gotta stay together.

1093
01:29:56,613 --> 01:29:57,978
We got-- We're--

1094
01:29:58,182 --> 01:30:00,013
-Okay, listen.
-You gotta have some place--

1095
01:30:00,217 --> 01:30:03,084
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1096
01:30:03,287 --> 01:30:04,777
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1097
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:08,389
-And where is it? Come on.
-Ellis and Jones.

1098
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:49,259
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1099
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:52,567
-Man.
-Hey, come on, man.

1100
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:53,963
-Come on.
-Come on, what?

1101
01:30:54,171 --> 01:30:55,763
-Hey, that's my spot.
-Back off.

1102
01:30:55,973 --> 01:30:58,407
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't--

1103
01:31:00,777 --> 01:31:02,335
Dad!

1104
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:04,838
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1105
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:06,640
Stop! Stop!

1106
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:09,148
Get out of the line, both of you.
Both of you.

1107
01:31:09,353 --> 01:31:11,947
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1108
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,190
I got here on time. I was in line.

1109
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:16,154
I came from work, I got my son.

1110
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,885
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1111
01:31:19,096 --> 01:31:20,688
He sliced in front of him in line.

1112
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:23,196
-Who did?
-He did.

1113
01:31:23,467 --> 01:31:27,995
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1114
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:39,238
That's it. No more.

1115
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:49,225
-What's your favorite color?
-Green.

1116
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:50,688
Green?

1117
01:31:50,894 --> 01:31:53,886
-What do you like that's green?
-Trees.

1118
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:57,089
Trees. What else?

1119
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:58,768
Holly.

1120
01:32:00,537 --> 01:32:04,496
-Holly. What's holly?
-The Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:05,242 --> 01:32:07,233
Christmas stuff.

1122
01:32:08,045 --> 01:32:09,808
What's that?

1123
01:32:13,016 --> 01:32:15,917
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1124
01:32:22,492 --> 01:32:27,486
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1125
01:32:27,931 --> 01:32:29,660
Can you breathe?

1126
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:32,130
-You're good?
-Yeah.

1127
01:32:32,569 --> 01:32:34,560
-I gotta go work on the scanner--
-Don't go.

1128
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:37,968
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1129
01:32:38,175 --> 01:32:42,305
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1130
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:45,475
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1131
01:32:45,682 --> 01:32:48,173
I wanna go home.

1132
01:32:50,253 --> 01:32:54,053
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1133
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:56,755
All right?

1134
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,894
I'm gonna go out there.

1135
01:32:59,096 --> 01:33:02,463
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1136
01:33:03,567 --> 01:33:05,262
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1137
01:33:06,236 --> 01:33:08,363
-All right?
-All right.

1138
01:33:08,572 --> 01:33:10,904
You gotta trust me, okay?

1139
01:33:11,108 --> 01:33:13,133
You gotta trust me.

1140
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:16,673
I trust you. I trust you.

1141
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,313
I trust you.

1142
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:21,507
-I can't hear you.
-I trust you. I trust you.

1143
01:33:25,322 --> 01:33:27,051
Give me a kiss.

1144
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:42,672
-I'll just be a little while, okay?
-All right.

1145
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:45,608
-I'll be right here.
-Okay.

1146
01:33:45,809 --> 01:33:48,004
-Can you still hear me?
-Yeah.

1147
01:33:48,211 --> 01:33:49,701
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1148
01:33:49,946 --> 01:33:52,414
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

1149
01:34:39,629 --> 01:34:41,290
-Yeah.
-Like that?

1150
01:34:41,498 --> 01:34:45,161
-Yeah, put that....
-Then you go like that.

1151
01:34:45,368 --> 01:34:48,860
-Is that okay?
-I don't know. What do you think?

1152
01:34:49,072 --> 01:34:50,130
Good.

1153
01:34:51,475 --> 01:34:53,705
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1154
01:34:54,945 --> 01:34:57,914
-Hey, why don't you leave it?
-We can't.

1155
01:34:58,115 --> 01:35:00,242
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1156
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:02,008
Go.

1157
01:35:07,357 --> 01:35:08,722
Hey, Chris.

1158
01:35:08,925 --> 01:35:12,258
-Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
-What's up?

1159
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:14,456
Work trip.

1160
01:35:14,664 --> 01:35:16,928
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1161
01:35:17,134 --> 01:35:18,897
-Yes, she does.
-And you guys are both...

1162
01:35:19,102 --> 01:35:20,763
...looking to retire at the same time?

1163
01:35:20,971 --> 01:35:23,064
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1164
01:35:23,273 --> 01:35:24,706
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1165
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:28,400
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1166
01:35:29,012 --> 01:35:30,912
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

1167
01:35:31,114 --> 01:35:33,014
I learned to finish my work quickly.

1168
01:35:33,316 --> 01:35:35,511
I had to finish quickly.

1169
01:35:35,852 --> 01:35:39,344
To get in line at Glide by 5.

1170
01:35:43,059 --> 01:35:44,993
Come on.

1171
01:35:45,462 --> 01:35:47,054
Come on.

1172
01:35:51,134 --> 01:35:53,932
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1173
01:35:54,804 --> 01:35:56,567
My Captain America!

1174
01:35:56,806 --> 01:35:59,104
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1175
01:35:59,309 --> 01:36:02,574
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1176
01:36:04,915 --> 01:36:06,940
-Why don't you let the lady in?
-Hey, back up.

1177
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:10,210
-Hey, man, that's not cool.
-Back up! Back up!

1178
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:19,995
Come on.

1179
01:36:22,999 --> 01:36:25,229
Dad, we need to get it!

1180
01:36:27,837 --> 01:36:30,465
The important thing about
that freedom train...

1181
01:36:30,674 --> 01:36:32,835
...is it's got to climb mountains.

1182
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:35,807
We all have to deal with mountains.

1183
01:36:36,012 --> 01:36:38,947
You know, mountains
that go way up high.

1184
01:36:39,349 --> 01:36:41,374
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1185
01:36:41,585 --> 01:36:42,847
-Amen, preacher!
-Yes.

1186
01:36:43,053 --> 01:36:45,351
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1187
01:36:45,655 --> 01:36:47,782
We sing about them.

1188
01:36:48,558 --> 01:36:54,087
Lord, don't move that mountain

1189
01:36:55,498 --> 01:37:01,926
Give me strength to climb it

1190
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:09,106
Please don't move
That stumbling block

1191
01:37:09,312 --> 01:37:15,876
But lead me, Lord, around it

1192
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,548
My burdens, they get so heavy

1193
01:37:24,394 --> 01:37:30,026
Seems hard to bear

1194
01:37:30,967 --> 01:37:34,528
But I won't give up
No, no

1195
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:36,763
Because you promised me

1196
01:37:36,973 --> 01:37:43,708
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer

1197
01:37:43,913 --> 01:37:51,445
-Lord don't move that mountain
-Please don't move that mountain

1198
01:37:51,655 --> 01:37:56,922
But give me strength to climb it

1199
01:37:59,162 --> 01:38:01,153
When's your test?

1200
01:38:02,365 --> 01:38:03,855
Tomorrow.

1201
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:10,035
Are you ready?

1202
01:38:13,943 --> 01:38:15,376
Of course.

1203
01:38:54,484 --> 01:38:55,781
Thank you, sir.

1204
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:07,356
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

1205
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:14,360
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere...?

1206
01:39:14,571 --> 01:39:17,039
I have to go somewhere.

1207
01:39:17,607 --> 01:39:20,440
-But I finished the whole thing too.
-Oh, good.

1208
01:39:20,643 --> 01:39:22,577
-You?
-Yeah.

1209
01:39:23,079 --> 01:39:26,048
-How'd you feel about the graphs?
-Easy.

1210
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:31,111
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1211
01:39:31,321 --> 01:39:34,950
-Essay question?
-Yeah, on the back.

1212
01:39:44,868 --> 01:39:46,233
Hey, Chris.

1213
01:39:46,436 --> 01:39:49,701
-Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
-Yeah.

1214
01:39:49,906 --> 01:39:53,398
-Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
-I never actually got your number.

1215
01:39:55,145 --> 01:39:57,113
Here's my number. Call me, okay?

1216
01:39:57,313 --> 01:39:59,975
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1217
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:04,516
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1218
01:40:04,721 --> 01:40:06,985
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1219
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:10,182
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1220
01:40:15,565 --> 01:40:17,726
-I'll pay you back, honest.
-Five is good?

1221
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:21,563
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1222
01:40:34,918 --> 01:40:37,409
That's it. That's the room quota.

1223
01:40:37,787 --> 01:40:40,551
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1224
01:40:40,757 --> 01:40:43,658
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1225
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,852
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1226
01:40:47,063 --> 01:40:51,363
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1227
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:28,099
You like it?

1228
01:42:19,155 --> 01:42:22,818
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1229
01:42:25,929 --> 01:42:29,524
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1230
01:42:29,732 --> 01:42:32,530
-How much?
-Eight dollars.

1231
01:42:33,636 --> 01:42:36,969
-What's that?
-It's to repair the light.

1232
01:42:37,173 --> 01:42:39,198
Can I see it?

1233
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:44,170
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1234
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:48,874
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1235
01:42:50,086 --> 01:42:51,951
I don't mind.

1236
01:42:52,422 --> 01:42:54,253
Yeah, you will.

1237
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,906
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1238
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:14,269
Okay.

1239
01:43:14,477 --> 01:43:17,571
-Warm enough?
-Yeah.

1240
01:43:17,847 --> 01:43:19,508
All right.

1241
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:24,519
Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:27,857 --> 01:43:32,055
-What?
-Did Mom leave because of me?

1243
01:43:36,633 --> 01:43:41,161
Don't-- Don't even think
something like that.

1244
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:44,365
Mom left because of Mom.

1245
01:43:44,574 --> 01:43:46,838
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1246
01:43:47,543 --> 01:43:49,443
Okay.

1247
01:43:59,288 --> 01:44:01,347
You're a good papa.

1248
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:11,189
All right, go to sleep.

1249
01:44:12,001 --> 01:44:14,936
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1250
01:45:11,394 --> 01:45:13,385
So far, so good, Chris.

1251
01:45:19,469 --> 01:45:22,029
-It works.
-Thank you very much.

1252
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:26,072
Two hundred and fifty dollars.
Four more weeks of oxygen.

1253
01:45:26,409 --> 01:45:30,641
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1254
01:45:30,847 --> 01:45:33,611
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1255
01:45:34,751 --> 01:45:36,378
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

1256
01:45:36,586 --> 01:45:37,917
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:40,055
-You ready?
-Yep.

1258
01:45:41,991 --> 01:45:44,892
-Are we going to the church place?
-No.

1259
01:45:45,094 --> 01:45:47,062
Where are we going, then?

1260
01:45:47,864 --> 01:45:50,424
-Probably stay at a hotel.
-A hotel?

1261
01:45:50,633 --> 01:45:51,691
Just for the night.

1262
01:45:51,901 --> 01:45:54,665
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1263
01:45:54,871 --> 01:45:56,600
No, thank you.

1264
01:45:56,806 --> 01:45:59,331
-Ever?
-I hope not.

1265
01:45:59,542 --> 01:46:01,009
Why not?

1266
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:04,008
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1267
01:46:04,213 --> 01:46:06,545
...and then not so much the next.

1268
01:46:06,749 --> 01:46:09,650
-Like the bus?
-Yeah, like the bus.

1269
01:46:09,852 --> 01:46:13,049
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh,
should I?

1270
01:46:26,068 --> 01:46:27,763
Sometimes when we're moving
at night...

1271
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:30,700
...we pass houses with lights
and people.

1272
01:46:31,474 --> 01:46:33,339
Sometimes you can
hear them laugh.

1273
01:46:38,748 --> 01:46:42,115
The next day, after work...

1274
01:46:42,318 --> 01:46:44,548
... we just went to the beach.

1275
01:46:44,754 --> 01:46:46,654
Far away from anything.

1276
01:46:46,856 --> 01:46:48,221
Everything.

1277
01:46:48,424 --> 01:46:50,085
Just Christopher and me.

1278
01:46:51,727 --> 01:46:54,093
-Did you see me?
-Yeah.

1279
01:46:54,297 --> 01:46:57,391
Far away from buses and noise...

1280
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:03,232
...and a constant disappointment
in my ten-gallon head...

1281
01:47:04,407 --> 01:47:06,272
...and myself.

1282
01:47:06,876 --> 01:47:09,242
-Chris, thank you very much.
-Well, thank you, Dean.

1283
01:47:09,445 --> 01:47:11,276
-Take care.
-You made all the right moves.

1284
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,004
Thanks, Chris.

1285
01:47:15,084 --> 01:47:16,415
Because when I was young...

1286
01:47:16,619 --> 01:47:20,385
...and I'd get an A on a history test
or whatever...

1287
01:47:20,590 --> 01:47:25,186
...I'd get this good feeling about
all the things that I could be.

1288
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:30,725
And then I never became
any of them.

1289
01:47:38,241 --> 01:47:40,766
-Hey, Chris.
-Hey.

1290
01:47:40,977 --> 01:47:43,605
-How you doing, Jay?
-I'm doing fine.

1291
01:47:43,813 --> 01:47:47,943
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1292
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:49,583
Yeah, yeah.

1293
01:47:49,785 --> 01:47:53,585
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1294
01:47:53,789 --> 01:47:55,416
I guess.

1295
01:47:58,394 --> 01:48:00,624
So one more day.

1296
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,422
Getting nervous?

1297
01:48:02,999 --> 01:48:05,365
-No, I'm okay.
-Yeah?

1298
01:48:05,568 --> 01:48:07,502
Listen, whatever happens...

1299
01:48:07,703 --> 01:48:10,137
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1300
01:48:10,339 --> 01:48:11,897
I mean that.

1301
01:48:12,742 --> 01:48:14,573
Take care of yourself.

1302
01:48:29,558 --> 01:48:32,755
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1303
01:48:33,062 --> 01:48:35,155
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1304
01:48:35,364 --> 01:48:37,855
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1305
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:40,062
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1306
01:48:40,703 --> 01:48:42,330
Yes, sir.

1307
01:48:42,538 --> 01:48:43,903
No, sir, that's it.

1308
01:48:44,106 --> 01:48:46,597
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1309
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:51,077
Chris. Come.

1310
01:49:18,474 --> 01:49:21,568
-Hi, Chris.
-Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1311
01:49:22,712 --> 01:49:24,646
-Nice shirt.
-Thank you, sir.

1312
01:49:24,847 --> 01:49:26,041
-Chris.
-Hey, Jay.

1313
01:49:26,482 --> 01:49:30,748
-Chris.
-Chris, sit down, please.

1314
01:49:33,689 --> 01:49:37,750
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1315
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,928
You know,
being the last day and all.

1316
01:49:40,129 --> 01:49:43,462
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1317
01:49:44,367 --> 01:49:46,130
But...

1318
01:49:46,335 --> 01:49:49,133
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1319
01:49:49,338 --> 01:49:52,273
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1320
01:49:53,009 --> 01:49:56,240
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1321
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:59,411
Would you like that, Chris?

1322
01:50:00,316 --> 01:50:01,908
Yes, sir.

1323
01:50:02,118 --> 01:50:05,485
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1324
01:50:06,455 --> 01:50:09,618
So welcome.

1325
01:50:11,494 --> 01:50:16,488
-Was it as easy as it looked?
-No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1326
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:21,234
-Good luck, Chris.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1327
01:50:27,643 --> 01:50:29,508
Oh, Chris.

1328
01:50:32,014 --> 01:50:34,107
I almost forgot.

1329
01:50:36,152 --> 01:50:37,710
Thank you.

1330
01:50:58,107 --> 01:51:00,302
This part of my life...

1331
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:03,405
...this little part...

1332
01:51:06,749 --> 01:51:09,377
...is called "Happiness. "

1333
01:51:56,098 --> 01:51:59,727
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1334
01:52:29,398 --> 01:52:31,798
So how many...

1335
01:52:32,001 --> 01:52:33,935
