176
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,607
I need full exposure.

177
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,151
Oh, I like full exposure from you, dear.

178
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,111
[Mrs. Walls chuckles]

179
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,031
You really think we'll build it?

180
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,407
Of course.

181
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,533
When?

182
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:42,620
You know, this running around
is only temporary.

183
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:47,458
We just need the perfect location
and then we can get to work on our castle.

184
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,378
Okay, now who needs a book?

185
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,005
- [kids] Me.
- Me.

186
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,799
[chuckles] You can drive.

187
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,551
Here's a new Zane Grey adventure.

188
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:01,222
And, oh, look.
You'll love this one, Jeannette.

189
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,515
<i>Black Beauty.</i>

190
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,935
It's like <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin,</i>
but for horses.

191
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,730
Dr. Taylor said,
staying home and reading books on our own

192
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,982
isn't a well-rounded education.

193
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,859
Oh, really?

194
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,654
He said we should be going to real school.

195
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,323
A real school, huh?

196
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,536
- [Mr. Walls] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [all screaming]

197
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,764
- [Mr. Walls] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [all screaming]

198
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:29,041
[all screaming, laughing]

199
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,379
[Brian] You're gonna kill us!

200
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,008
[Jeannette] Dad!

201
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,885
[tires screeching]

202
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,012
Everyone out.

203
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,931
[Mr. Walls] Come on!

204
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,350
Look at this.

205
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,272
All those Juniper and Joshua trees
have adapted to survive

206
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,400
on only five inches of rainfall a year.

207
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:59,947
That inselberg was formed from cooling
magma over a hundred million years ago.

208
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,409
Pretty soon, the sun's coming down
and we'll be watching

209
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:09,582
Orion and Aquarius and Horologion
rotate through the night's sky.

210
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,376
This is as real as it gets, kids!

211
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,046
And don't let no
dumbass doctor tell you different.

212
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,632
You learn from living!

213
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,468
Everything else is a damn lie.

214
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,388
Oh! Look at that.

215
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,890
What is it, baby?

216
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:29,977
That is the most beautiful tree
I've ever seen!

217
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,062
Somebody get my canvas!

218
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,566
It looks like
we'll be sleeping here tonight, kids.

219
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,278
[Mr. Walls] This is actually great
for your posture.

220
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:44,325
You know, the Indian's never use pillows
either and look how straight they stand.

221
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,662
Why that one?

222
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:54,335
[sighs] The wind's been beaten
that tree down since the day it was born.

223
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,129
But it refuses to fall.

224
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,507
It's the struggle that
gives it its beauty.

225
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,902
[footsteps approaching]

226
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:38,295
[whispering] Dad. Dad.

227
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,839
Hmm?

228
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,635
I think maybe I saw something out there.

229
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:50,057
All right. Did you get a good look at it?

230
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,310
Not really.

231
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:59,358
Was he a big ol' hairy son of a bitch

232
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,778
with the damnedest lookin'
teeth and claws?

233
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,698
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

234
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:12,371
And uh, did it have pointy ears and
evil eyes with fire in them?

235
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,916
You've seen him too?

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,793
Oh yeah. Yeah.

237
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:21,005
I've been chasing that demon for years.

238
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,216
Where'd you see him?

239
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,177
Ow.

240
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,433
I gotta get that off of you.

241
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,311
[wood thudding]

242
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,272
It's okay, fire can't get you here.

243
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,401
We're just gonna let
this wound breathe a little.

244
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,570
Yeah?

245
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,699
Now I want you
to just hold this puppy right there.

246
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:56,498
You see the top of the flames where
the yellow dissolves into the heat?

247
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:02,796
That zone is known in physics as
the boundary between turbulence and order.

248
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,301
It's a place where no rules apply.

249
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:11,138
Or at least,
they haven't figured 'em out yet.

250
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,350
And that's how life is.

251
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,896
A bunch of molecules bouncing off
each other at random.

252
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:24,401
So there's no point in trying to find
a reason or pattern

253
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,446
for why you were born at a certain time

254
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,865
or why you got bit by that fire.

255
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,912
You just got a little too close
to the chaos is all.

256
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,124
You understand?

257
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,961
[laughing]

258
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,963
I'm not sure I do either.

259
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,596
There. How's that feel?

260
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,662
- [man] Jeannette.
- Yeah?

261
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,915
Got a surprise for you in here.

262
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,751
Okay.

263
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,756
You said it was fun.

264
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,092
No, I said it was funny.

265
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,511
- Okay, well...
- And it's very overpriced.

266
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,431
It's Italian. That's why.

267
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,932
Just sit down in it.

268
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,101
Enjoy the chair for a second.

269
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,856
Just wiggle around in it a little bit.

270
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,942
You're not wiggling... There you go.

271
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,487
I'll take it back. It's fine.

272
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,549
- No, no. It's fine. I'm just...
- Don't worry about it.

273
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,617
- I'll take the chair back.
- It's not about the chair. I...

274
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,579
I'm getting lunch with my mom today.

275
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,839
I didn't tell you
'cause I didn't want you to worry.

276
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,632
Are you gonna tell her?

277
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,092
About, about us?

278
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,221
I'm gonna have to tell her at some point.

279
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,473
Okay.

280
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,685
[chuckles] Okay.

281
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,729
Just, please,

282
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:27,107
try to not let her dump
her crap on you this time.

283
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,735
That's what parents are for.

284
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,403
Can you just try though?

285
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,072
- Of course I'll try.
- Thank you.

286
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,540
Mom?

287
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,380
Well, your dad said he saw you pass by
in a cab the other night.

288
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,299
Acted like we weren't even there.

289
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,426
You shouldn't be ashamed of us

290
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,887
just 'cause we choose
a different lifestyle than you.

291
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,516
Being homeless in New York City
does not count as a lifestyle choice.

292
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,851
Well, if we heard from you more you'd know

293
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,103
that we found a lovely place
on the Lower East Side.

294
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,398
Lori says you're squatting
in an abandoned building.

295
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,776
That does not sound safe, Mom.

296
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,945
Why did you lose your sense of adventure?

297
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,532
I have a little bit of money now,
I can help you if you want.

298
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:20,202
Nuh-uh. We're fine.
You're the one that needs help.

299
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,330
Look at you. Your values are all confused

300
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,298
So, what did you want to talk about?

301
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,762
I'm getting married.

302
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,476
To the accountant?

303
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,437
David is a financial analyst.

304
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:52,651
Well, I don't mean to be rude
but isn't he a little...

305
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,404
Mom, David is good for me.

306
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,532
You mean he's got money.

307
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,118
I mean I'm in love with him.

308
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,875
Can I see that again?

309
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,716
Mm. Well...

310
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:20,721
I just hope you've got a good plan
for telling your dad because this...

311
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,557
is gonna kill him.

312
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,188
[baby cooing]

313
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,776
[Jeannette]
Shh. It's okay. I'm right here.

314
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,780
Everything's gonna be okay, Maureen.

315
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,824
I'm gonna take care of you.

316
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,076
[cooing]

317
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,287
[startling noise]

318
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,832
Let's go, kids! Time to pull off stage
and leave this hellhole behind.

319
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,209
- What's going on?
- The Feds are on our tail.

320
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,962
- [Brian] Really?
- He means the bill collectors.

321
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,547
Truck leaves in 15 minutes.

322
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,800
[Mrs. Walls] No, there's not enough room
in the cab,

323
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,845
so you guys are in for a real treat.

324
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,513
You get to ride in the back.

325
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,806
What?

326
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,684
Hey,
it's not an ideal scenario for anyone,

327
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,770
so we'll just try to make the best of it.

328
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,356
It'll be kind of like
that road ride at the fair.

329
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,149
[Lori] Except without
any lights or oxygen.

330
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,027
[Mrs. Walls] Oh, don't be so dramatic.
It'll be an adventure.

331
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,198
- Be careful. There you go.
- [Maureen crying]

332
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,741
[Mrs. Walls] Okay, scoot back.

333
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,870
[Lori] How long do
we have to be back here?

334
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,714
[Mr. Walls] Don't worry. This'll be the
last time you have to do this.

335
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,249
[door shutting]

336
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,210
[door opening]

337
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,298
[Mr. Walls] Welcome
to the oldest mining town in Utah.

338
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,842
- I thought that was the last town.
- Me too.

339
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,803
That one was the oldest in Nevada.

340
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:47,015
[Mr. Walls] People been striking it rich
here for a hundred years.

341
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,143
They must've moved somewhere else
to spend their fortune.

342
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,938
It has a real frontier quality to it.

343
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,400
Think we might be able
to stay here for a while?

344
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,695
Mm, I got a good feeling about this one.

345
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,279
[chuckles]

346
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,330
[Mrs. Walls] I got it.

347
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,085
[kids chattering]

348
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:19,715
[Mrs. Walls] The kids are tired of moving
to a new town every time you lose a job.

349
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,591
They loved it in West Virginia.

350
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,097
I just think it'd be good for them to see
where their daddy grew up.

351
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,851
Mountain Goat, let go.

352
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,894
Try floating a little.

353
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,107
We're fine where we are.

354
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,818
Taking showers at the public pool?

355
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,739
I'll get the water turned on this weekend.

356
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,991
You said that two months ago.

357
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,787
Okay, Brian. Don't be shy.

358
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,083
Everyone here is the same as us,
they've just got different complexions.

359
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,711
Go on. Go play.

360
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:07,053
If we went, your parents
can help us out with some money.

361
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,058
I ain't moving back to Welch.

362
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,686
What are you so afraid of?

363
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,107
I ain't afraid of nothing.

364
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,110
Hey!

365
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,613
Quit clinging to the side!

366
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,866
[splashes]

367
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,210
Yeah. Don't be scared. I gotcha.

368
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,924
Yeah. Kick your legs.

369
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,885
Yeah, it's not so hard.

370
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,305
It's all about moving the water.

371
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,182
Yup.

372
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,062
Move your arms. Go ahead.

373
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,607
Woo, in the water. Push the water.
Push it.

374
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,735
Push it with your arms. That's good.

375
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,362
It's not so bad, is it?

376
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:09,115
Good. 'Cause you're gonna learn
to swim today.

377
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,076
No!

378
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:20,085
- [gasps]
- Catch your breath. Catch your breath.

379
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,629
Oh, my goodness.

380
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,257
All right. Breathe. Nice.

381
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,092
- Why'd you do that?
- Okay.

382
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,846
- Now, sink or swim.
- No!

383
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,108
[gasps]

384
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,820
- [Mrs. Walls] Rex!
- It's okay!

385
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,155
She's already getting it.

386
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,451
Pretty soon she's gonna
be doing the backstroke. Right?

387
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,954
- No. I wanna go back.
- Yeah? Okay.

388
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,998
- All right!
- Dad!

389
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,755
[gasps]

390
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,424
[Mr. Walls] You did it, baby!

391
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,467
- [Jeannette crying]
- You were swimming!

392
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,511
Hey!

393
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:15,015
- Mountain Goat.
- [woman] Mister, you're wrong for that.

394
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,492
[Mrs. Walls] Come on, kids. Let's go.

395
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,060
- [crying] No!
- Hey. Hey!

396
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,271
Don't touch me!

397
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,565
- You tried to kill me.
- Hey.

398
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,359
I would never let anything bad
happen to you.

399
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,405
But I can't let you cling to the side your
whole life just because you're scared.

400
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,159
If you don't want to sink,
you have to learn how to swim.

401
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,577
Understand?

402
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,332
Hey, you were swimming.

403
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:43,335
You were swimming. I'm so proud of you.
[chuckles]

404
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,798
Hey. Everything okay?

405
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,551
She's fine. Mind your own damn business.

406
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,137
What happens in my pool is my business.

407
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,431
Oh, so this is your pool?

408
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,266
As far as your concerned, yeah.

409
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,062
Oh, so you're the one who limits the black
families to an hour in the mornings,

410
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,272
so that the whites can swim
the rest of the day.

411
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,942
That's been a federal offense since '64.

412
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,362
Does he always act like this,
or just when he's drunk?

413
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,033
- [choking]
- Dad! No!

414
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:15,992
- Dad, don't!
- Rex!

415
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,120
I can't let you talk to me like that
in front of my daughter.

416
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,289
- Let go! Stop
- I'm gonna tap him out.

417
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,333
- Is that a tap? I couldn't tell.
- Dad! Let go!

418
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,043
- Is that a tap?
- [Mrs. Walls] Rex!

419
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:26,544
Will you stop?

420
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,297
- [boy] Come on, man!
- You're going to jail, asshole.

421
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,967
- [man] Why you let him go?
- [indistinct commotion]

422
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,056
Get in the car.

423
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,060
[Mrs. Walls]
We're leaving with or without you.

424
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:46,439
I'd rather be in hell with my back broke
than live in that godforsaken town.

425
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,793
Yeah? You should have thought of that
before you got every

426
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,694
policeman in town looking for us.

427
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,905
I'm not gonna let them take our kids away.

428
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,616
We cannot live like this anymore.

429
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,245
Like what? This is freedom.

430
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:03,331
Freedom? You call this freedom?

431
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:10,964
Here we go.

432
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,302
[exhales] Welch is gonna be fun.

433
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,890
We'll live in the mountains
with the squirrels and the chipmunks.

434
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,602
And you'll get to meet your Grandma
and Grandpa Walls.

435
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,897
Who are genuine hillbillies

436
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,608
[engine starts]

437
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,069
We don't need him.

438
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,500
Rex!

439
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,628
Come on, Dad!

440
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,797
[honks]

441
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,258
You're the head of this family!

442
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,849
[door opens]

443
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,060
[door shuts]

444
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,656
Are you coming?

445
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:20,575
Negative.

446
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,372
Mountain Goat, you know your...
your Mama has

447
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:31,586
convinced you that we need to go
because she's in a state of fear.

448
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,797
Now what you need to do

449
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,091
is stand your ground.
You see, that's what I'm doing.

450
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,926
This is a very important lesson for you.

451
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,388
You don't look like
a very important lesson to me.

452
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,810
Come on.

453
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,188
Can I hold your ankle?

454
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,397
No.

455
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,108
Just for stability.

456
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,193
I feel like I'm about to fall.

457
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,570
You're on the ground already.

458
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:58,988
[Mr. Walls chuckling]

459
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,493
- [door closes]
- [Mr. Walls] All right, let's do it.

460
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,786
[Jeannette] I got him.

461
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,038
He's alive.

462
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,998
[Mrs. Walls] Oh, thank God.

463
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,336
Oh, watch out. Don't squish Maureen.

464
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,341
Move over, baby. I'm driving.

465
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,053
Come here, give me some sugar.

466
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,097
[Mrs. Walls chuckles] Oh, Rex.

467
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:25,849
[David] Jeannette.

468
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,411
- Can I have another tissue, please?
- Oh, jeez, David.

469
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,622
- I just... I need, I need another tissue.
- You're sweating through your shirt.

470
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,332
Please don't point it out.
You know when you point it out

471
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,334
- it only makes me sweat more.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,235
You have nothing to be nervous about.

473
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,279
[exhales] Your dad already hates me.

474
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,841
If he finds out we're getting married,
he's gonna throw me through a window.

475
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,700
Hey, he's not gonna do that.

476
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,535
He might kick you in the stomach though.

477
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,412
It's too real to be funny.

478
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,830
I know I'm just not there yet.

479
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,039
Okay.

480
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,101
He's gonna try to make me
to get drunk with him again.

481
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,210
- No, he's not.
- You know he is.

482
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,045
David, just tell him that
you don't want it.

483
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,172
Well...

484
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,382
Maybe, maybe I will do that.

485
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,277
- Yeah, I'm not to be bullied by him.
- I know you're not.

486
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,344
- I will not be bullied.
- Hey...

487
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,763
- We're getting married.
- We are getting married.

488
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,557
We can get through this. This is nothing.

489
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,683
Okay.

490
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,270
Hey, Dad.

491
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,983
Oh, come on.

492
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,737
Hey, Dad.

493
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,365
Oh, so you're acknowledging
my existence now?

494
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,660
Well you're not exactly
the easiest man to ignore.

495
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,999
Well, I wanted to get this done
before you got here.

496
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:37,712
I don't know who designed this junk,
but the mechanics are all wrong.

497
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,383
Look at you.

498
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,720
Fancier every time I see ya.

499
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,559
It's good to see you, Mr. Walls.
How are you?

500
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:56,397
Did you win that wet t-shirt contest?
Nice nips.

501
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,816
- Cut it out.
- It was really hot in the car.

502
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,193
It's the humidity.

503
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,736
Humidity.

504
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:05,406
Okay, just try not to drip
on my marble floor.

505
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,701
Grab that toolbox
if it's not too much for you.

506
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,286
Okay.

507
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,581
Just finished hooking every squat
in the building to an insulated

508
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,251
cable that hotwired it off
the utility pole down the block.

509
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,773
Now the other squatters want to make me
the mayor of the place.

510
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,342
Your mama's tradition of yellow door.

511
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,844
Still gotta get hinges for this thing.

512
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,305
This is my friend, Eddy.

513
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,807
- Does he live here?
- Hello.

514
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,059
Oh! There she is.

515
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,062
- Hey, sweetie. How are ya?
- Oh, Mom.

516
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:39,649
Look at that food.

517
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,276
What a place.

518
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,695
Anyone else feel like
they're back at Welch?

519

00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,584
How about the other one?

693
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:14,343
Okay, I'll be back in an hour with a feast
you can tell your children about.

694
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,345
Your children's children.

695
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,972
Children's children's children.

696
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:24,019
And their children's children's children's
children's children's children's...

697
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,938
[crickets chirping]

698
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:36,240
He probably just
got stuck talking to someone.

699
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,117
For ten hours?

700
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:43,789
[door closes]

701
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:44,915
[muttering]

702
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,378
[footsteps]

703
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:53,507
- [clattering]
- [Mr. Walls] Oh lord.

704
00:43:58,762 --> 00:43:59,763
Dad?

705
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,684
Hey, kiddo.

706
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,978
What are you doing up?

707
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,605
What happened?

708
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,735
Oh, I got into a fight with the mountain.

709
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,280
Mountain won.

710
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,537
Dad, that looks really bad.

711
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,415
Yeah. That don't look good.

712
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:29,793
What can I do?

713
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,138
Don't worry about me.

714
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:45,476
I'm so thoroughly pickled...

715
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,228
I won't feel a thing.

716
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,482
Here.

717
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,157
Okay, go ahead.

718
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,793
- Go on.
- I can't do it.

719
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,213
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:16,924
It's okay. It's all right.

721
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,593
We'll do it together, okay?

722
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:22,930
[Mr. Walls chuckling]
It's all right. Come here.

723
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,807
Squeeze it together.

724
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:29,728
That's it. Now, push it through.

725
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,147
Yeah. Ah...

726
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:34,691
Good. Just push it right through.

727
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,278
Good.

728
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:41,907
Oh, that's good. Brave.

729
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,409
You are amazing.

730
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,287
Ah...

731
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,498
- Okay.
- Push it right through. Go on.

732
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,292
That's it. Yeah.

733
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,380
Oh, my God, that's beautiful. Oh, jeez.

734
00:45:56,463 --> 00:46:00,300
You don't have to tug quite so hard on it.
It's not like tug of war.

735
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:01,969
- [chuckles]
- [Mr. Walls scoffs]

736
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:03,804
[Jeannette] Okay.

737
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,931
[Mr. Walls]
And one more. That's good.

738
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,099
Wow.

739
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,728
That's some mighty fine handiwork.

740
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:23,198
I swear... at times I think that...

741
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,159
you're the only one around...

742
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,538
that still has any faith in me.

743
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:37,254
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

744
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,548
Anything.

745
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,259
All you got to do is ask.

746
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,938
Do you think...

747
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,740
you could maybe stop drinking?

748
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:13,957
It's just... when you drink,
you can't take care of us.

749
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,305
You must be awfully ashamed
of your old man.

750
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:31,016
No.

751
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,605
I'd just think we'd have money for food.

752
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:41,318
Maybe even some extra
for the glass castle.

753
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:47,908
You can do it if you want.

754
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,454
You're stronger than anyone.

755
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,922
[exhales]

756
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,885
Well, if you don't mind, honey, I...

757
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,640
I'd figure I'd like to just...

758
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,686
sit here by myself for a while.

759
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,515
Dad?

760
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:59,771
For the next few days

761
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:03,567
I'm gonna be keeping to myself from
upstairs and

762
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:05,652
I uh...

763
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:09,322
I need you kids to steer clear of me.

764
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:14,161
Take your brother and sisters outside,
do something fun, okay?

765
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:19,291
And no matter what happens...

766
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:24,546
If I ask for a drink,
you can't let anyone give me one.

767
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,841
Not a drop.

768
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,010
Okay?

769
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,512
Can you do that for me?

770
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:35,390
Yeah.

771
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:36,683
You promise?

772
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:43,899
That's a good girl.

773
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,507
[Brian] Do you think we can start
building the new house soon?

774
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:50,947
[Jeannette] Probably.

775
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,617
[Mr. Walls groans]

776
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,077
Help me!

777
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,205
[Mr. Walls groans]

778
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,460
[Mr. Walls screams]

779
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:09,799
- Oh, God! Make it stop!
- Shh.

780
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,219
- It's okay.
- Please, make it stop!

781
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:15,472
- Just breathe, honey.
- Rose Mary!

782
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:19,309
- [Mr. Walls] God, help me!
- [Mrs. Walls] Shh. It's okay, it's okay.

783
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:23,522
[Mr. Walls, distant] No... Help!

784
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,360
- [Jeannette] No...
- [Mr. Walls] Help me! Please...

785
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,907
[Mr. Walls, distant] Mountain Goat!

786
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,581
Dad...

787
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,003
Mountain Goat.

788
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,798
Please...

789
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,384
give me a drink.

790
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,555
I'll get you some water.

791
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,306
No, no, no.

792
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,852
There's some whiskey under the sink.

793
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:05,647
Go fetch it for me.

794
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:11,903
Jeannette...

795
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,365
I'm dying.

796
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:20,495
If you don't give me a drink,
I'm gonna die.

797
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,999
That is a scientific fact.

798
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:25,667
Understand?

799
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,589
You want me to die?
Do you want your daddy to die?

800
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:33,967
I can't, Dad.

801
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:36,469
I promised too.

802
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:39,848
I don't care about your stupid promise!

803
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,809
Go get me a drink right now!

804
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,687
- [Jeannette crying]
- [Mr. Walls] Jeannette, go get me a drink!

805
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,064
Jeannette!

806
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:06,708
[Mr. Walls] Foundation looks pretty good.

807
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,085
We're almost ready to start building.

808
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:16,509
- [Jeannette] I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

809
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,182
How 'bout that?

810
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,523
[Mrs. Walls] Oh, look at that.

811
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:36,071

814
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,499
Dad's leaving for work!

815
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,419
Stop. I can't put your hat on.

816
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:55,090
[grunts] All right,
make sure it ain't faulty.

817
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,094
Ow, ow, ow. Okay, okay, okay. It's fine.

818
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,114
- Oh, thanks, Bill. Merry Christmas.
- [Bill] Good evening, Rex.

819
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,391
- [Mr. Walls] Merry Christmas, ladies.
- [woman] You too.

820
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,434
[Mr. Walls] The foreman forgot his toolbox

821
00:53:06,518 --> 00:53:11,481
and so I had to use this macaroni noodle
to insulate these cross wires

822
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,818
and now I got every damn person
at work telling me

823
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,278
that I really know how to use my noodle.

824
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:19,572

827
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,798

with that thing.

[Jeannette] It's so pretty.

834
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:06,453
[Mr. Walls] And beautiful.

835
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:12,417
Rich city folk live in fancy apartments.

836
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,546
But their air is so polluted,
they can't even see the stars.

837
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:22,761
We'd have to be out of our minds
to trade places with any of them.

838
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,850
Go on, pick out your favorite one.

839
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,478
It's yours for keeps.

840
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:34,272
You can't give me a star.

841
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:37,275
It's your Christmas present.

842
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:42,071
No one owns the stars.

843
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:46,993
Well, that's why you've got to claim 'em
before anyone else does.

844
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,456
Like uh, Columbus claimed America
for Queen Isabella.

845
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:54,793
Claiming a star for your own
has just as much logic.

846
00:54:56,002 --> 00:55:00,632
Maybe more 'cause you don't have to kill
and subjugate millions of people to do it.

847
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,343
So go ahead and pick out anyone you want.

848
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:06,471
Except for Beetlejuice and Rigel
because uh,

849
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:09,849
Lori and Brian already laid claim to them.

850
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:15,188
I want that one.

851
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:17,212
- [Mr. Walls] The bright one?
- Yeah.

852
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,443
That's Venus. She's a planet.

853
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:23,363
Kind of dinky compared to real stars.

854
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:26,282
She just looks brighter
'cause she's close to us.

855
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,454
I like it anyway.

856
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:37,502
What the hell, it's Christmas.
You can have a planet if you want.

857
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,504
[mutters]

858
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:42,465
You know her atmosphere's
a lot like the Earth's,

859
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:45,969
only uh, 500 degrees hotter.

860
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:47,554
- Really?
- Yeah.

861
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:52,433
So when the sun starts to burn out
and the Earth turns cold.

862
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:55,270
Everyone might want to move to
Venus to get warm,

863
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:58,165
and now they're gonna have to get
permission from your descendants first.

864
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,357
[chuckles]

865
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,743
You know, I love you, kid.

866
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,287
I love you more.

867
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,835
[Mr. Walls exhales]

868
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:24,257
[soft music playing]

869
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,517
I really like David.

870
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:38,354
- You really what?
- [Mrs. Walls] Yeah.

871
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,356
He's not that boring

872
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,902
I think he'd be a nice addition
to the family.

873
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:48,448
Oh, by the way, I just found out

874
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:51,618
my brother's planning to sell
his half of Mom's land.

875
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:54,412
- Uncle Jim?
- Yup and it's a real shame.

876
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:56,497
My father always taught me you never...

877
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:58,249
[Mr. Walls] Free market my ass.

878
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,085
The whole thing is a rigged game
and you know it.

879
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:05,673
It's a system created by all you fat cats
to make yourselves richer

880
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:07,675
and keep the poor where they are.

881
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:10,261
It's nothing more than legalized larceny

882
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:12,585
- Admit it, David.
- Well, on behalf of all the fat cats,

883
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,617
I'm not going to admit
to something that's not true.

884
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,351
- David.
- Jeannette, it's fine.

885
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,853
- We're just, we're just talking.
- Yeah, we're just talking.

886
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:21,898
You know what, Rex?
Let's just agree to disagree.

887
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:26,402
On behalf of the 90 percent in our country
working for 4.75 an hour,

888
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:28,112
I will do no such thing.

889
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:30,073
Now very noble of you.

890
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:32,200
A real champion of the people.

891
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:33,451
How drunk are you?

892
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:36,454
How 'bout we settle this
the way they did in ancient Rome,

893
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:39,290
with a good ol' fashion
arm wrestling match?

894
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,310
Pretty sure that's not something
they did in Rome.

895
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:42,627
Dad, enough.

896
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,880
Come on, Mountain Goat.
David was gonna fight for your honor.

897
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:48,007
- This is ridiculous.
- Yes.

898
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:50,468
It's ridiculous. We are going home.

899
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:53,721
What? You're giving up already?

900
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:57,976
You gonna just wander out of here
with your tail between your legs?

901
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:03,564
I'm not gonna arm wrestle you.

902
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:05,775
Oh, okay. So you admit it.

903
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:07,694
I'm right and you're wrong.

904
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,199
[scoffs] Okay.

905
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,035
- What the hell?
- Attaboy!

906
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:19,288
- [Mrs. Walls cheering]
- [Jeannette] No, David.

907
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,874
- This is a bad idea.
- Babe, it's gonna be fun.

908
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:24,544
- Babe, it's gonna be fun.
- Babe, it's gonna be fun.

909
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:26,212
Dad, please.

910
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:29,090
Come on. Don't you want to give him
a chance to prove me wrong?

911
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:32,552
[David]
Yes. Jeannette, let me prove him wrong.

912
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:36,973
Okay. You guys want to be idiots?

913
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,767
- [all cheering]
- [David] All right. Here we go!

914
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,787
- [Mrs. Walls] Rex, come on.
- [Brian] Put 'em up!

915
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:43,691
- [Brian] All right.
- [Mrs. Walls] Let's do it.

916
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:46,065
- [Brian] Ready! Set!
- [Mrs. Walls] Straighten up.

917
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,569
- Go! Come on, David!
- [Mrs. Walls] Come on, Rex!

918
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,963
- Yay, yay. Come on!
- [Brian] Come on, David.

919
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:54,091
- [Brian] David, you got this. David, push!
- [Mrs. Walls] Come on, Rex. Come on.

920
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:55,575
[Mr. Walls] How does that feel, boy?

921
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,136
[Mrs. Walls] Come on, David. Come on!

922
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,454
[Mrs. Walls and Brian cheering]

923
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:01,748
[Mr. Walls]
You're gonna lose to an old man.

924
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,916
Come on, honey.
Bring it home, bring it home!

925
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,586
[Mrs. Walls]
Let out the wild man, come on, Rex!

926
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:09,380
David, come on. You're stronger than this.

927
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,859
- Come on, let's go, David.
- [Mrs. Walls] Let the wild man go!

928
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:13,843
What did I tell ya? No fight.

929
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,181
Go on, David, kick his ass!

930
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,515
Take him down!

931
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,102
- [all cheering]
- Murder him! Murder him, David!

932
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:25,786
- [cheering continues]
- Let's go, David. Bring him down. Come on!

933
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:28,232
Rex, don't lose this! Come on!

934
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:31,027
You're better than this, you bastard!
Take him down!

935
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,195
Take him down!

936
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,864
[cheering continues]

937
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:37,575
Go, go, go, go, go!

938
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:41,954
[cheering continues]

939
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:46,793
Dow Jones will live to see another day!

940
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,087
Left-handed rematch.

941
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,172
I wanted a left-handed rematch.

942
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:54,675
- No, Dad, don't be a sore loser.
- Left-handed rematch.

943
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:57,637
I'm ready for whatever
you want to throw at me, old man.

944
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,013
- Oh!
- [gasps]

945
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:00,515
What the hell, Dad?

946
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,118
- [Brian] Oh, Jesus.
- [Lori] Oh, shit.

947
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,061
Well, you heard that man. I mean he said

948
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:07,313
he was ready for whatever
I wanted to throw at him.

949
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:10,066
- I think he broke my nose.
- [Mr. Walls] It's not my fault.

950
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,110
I have a soldier's reflex.

951
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:14,654
I seriously thought you were ready.

952
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,532
Tell your boyfriend that
he needs to be careful

953
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,283
about saying things he doesn't mean.

954
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,203
He's not my boyfriend, Dad.

955
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,663
He's my fiancé.

956
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,208
[Lori] Let's get you home.

957
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,397
It's not stopping, I don't know where all
the blood is coming from.

958
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,714
And please, I don't want that.

959
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:37,593
Why do you still have all
these stupid boxes?

960
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,805
David, you're drunk. Just drink some water
and let's go to bed.

961
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,741
- He punched me in the face, Jeannette.
- I know.

962
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,933
You told me not to worry

963
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:46,352
and then he punched me
right in the middle of the face.

964
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,729
And everybody was shouting.
It was so loud.

965
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,607
And you screamed at me,
you said, "Murder him!"

966
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,235
You shouted it right into my ear,
like a madwoman.

967
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,029
- Please just drink some water.
- This is serious, Jeannette.

968
01:00:57,113 --> 01:01:00,158
Your dad is a total nut-job.

969
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,326
Hey, I can call him that. Not you.

970
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,786
Your mom is delusional.

971
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,372
Poor Maureen,
she's got to be out of her mind

972
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:08,433
that she's choosing to live in
that dump with them.

973
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,877
This is my family that
you are talking about.

974
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,796
I know, and they are totally insane.

975
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:34,984
Jeannette, I...

976
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:39,155
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you,

977
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:41,532
but if we're gonna try
and do that together...

978
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:48,039
I can't have any more
of whatever that was tonight.

979
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,800
I gotta, I gotta go pee.

980
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,179
I'm gonna pee.

981
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:06,515
[door closes]

982
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:14,232
Don't worry,
it's about a 20-hour drive to Texas.

983
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:17,401
I can do it in under 15.
We'll be back before you know it.

984
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:19,237
How did Grandma Smith die?

985
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,531
My mother was an old woman.
Old woman die.

986
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:23,950
Did she leave you anything?

987
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,452
What kind of a question is that?

988
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:27,995
Why can't we come with you?

989
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,622
I don't want to stay with Erma.

990
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:32,667
Your dad hasn't had a drink in two months.

991
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,877
I think we deserve a little vacation.

992
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:36,420
But Erma hates us.

993
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:39,298
Don't blame her for her misery,
it's all she knows.

994
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:40,800
[Jeannette] She's a dumb witch.

995
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:43,010
Actually, she's very smart.

996
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:45,221
That's where your dad gets it from.

997
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:48,182
[man on TV] <i>He painted a self-portrait
with a bandaged ear.</i>

998
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:49,100
Van Gogh.

999
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,827
- [woman] <i>Who is van Gogh?</i>
- [man] <i>That's right.</i>

1000
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,561
[Erma]
You eat what I put on your plate.

1001
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:54,647
If you spit that out,
you're gonna eat that too.

1002
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,817
No running in the house.
No shouting. No whining.

1003
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,695
No opening the windows or the curtains.

1004
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:01,821
Edgar Bergen.

1005
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,984
<i>- Who is Edgar Bergen.</i>
- [man] <i>Edgar Bergen is right.</i>

1006
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:11,372
It's so weird that Dad lived here
when he was our age.

1007
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,250
Yeah, I thought we had it bad.

1008
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,129
[Brian] Look at this.

1009
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:29,015
You think Dad really wrote all this?

1010
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:31,517
Listen to this.

1011
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:35,855
"There might be more than
this blanket of black dust.

1012
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:40,609
The stench of the tug,
the crunch of the coal-stained snow.

1013
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:45,740
More than the sound of her cackle,
the cracks in her callused hands.

1014
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:49,618
There might be more but I won't ever know

1015
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:52,747
because it's impossible to breathe when
you're drowning in..."

1016
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:55,875
he cusses.

1017
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:03,424
"It's impossible to breathe when
you're drowning in shit."

1018
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,635
[all laughing]

1019
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,888
- [thudding]
- [Erma] Keep it down!

1020
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,974
This is gonna be a fun week.

1021
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:21,901
You bring a sharpener?

1022
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,320
Yeah, in my bag downstairs.

1023
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:35,039
[indistinct chattering]

1024
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:37,500
[Brian] No, Erma. Please.

1025
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,710
- [Erma] You do what I tell you.
- [Brian] Stop it.

1026
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:43,589
- [Erma] Just be quiet, boy.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1027
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,883
- [Erma] I'm just going to... Hold still.
- Hey!

1028
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:48,511
Get away from him!

1029
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:49,929
Lori!

1030
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:52,973
The boys britches needed fixing.

1031
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,810
I know what I saw. She's a pervert.

1032
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:57,478
- Little bitch.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1033
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,938
Let's just calm down, okay?

1034
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,356
[gasps]

1035
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:06,320
[groans]

1036
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:08,823
[Jeannette]
Come help me! Hold her down!

1037
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,492
Get the hell off of me, you little beasts.

1038
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:14,370
[Jeannette] Nobody messes
with our brother!

1039
01:05:14,453 --> 01:05:16,580
[Erma] Stanley. Get them off me.

1040
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:19,750
- [kids muttering]
- [Jeannette] Put me down!

1041
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,303
[door opens]

1042
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,018
Dad.

1043
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,855
We were just protecting ourselves.

1044
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:44,233
- Erma was grabbing his...
- Shut up!

1045
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,239
I don't want to hear another damn word
about whatever did or didn't happen!

1046
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:53,409
It don't matter!

1047
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,539
Brian's a man,
he can take care of himself!

1048
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,624
Can't you?

1049
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,255
Let's go.

1050
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,064
Are you coming?

1051
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:35,451
Come on, kids, let's go inside.

1052
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:40,498
Come on, guys, let's go.

1053
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:43,166
Come on.

1054
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:57,973
Get out.

1055
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:03,479
Not if you're gonna drink.

1056
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,650
You promised.

1057
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:23,791
[door opens]

1058
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,878
[door slams closed]

1059
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,298
I'm not going.

1060
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:36,053
I'm not going. I don't want to...

1061
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:40,057
Stop! Dad...

1062
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,231
[Jeannette's indistinct cries]

1063
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:54,154
[Jeannette] I don't want to see him drunk.

1064
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:58,450
See what you do?

1065
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,579
[Mr. Walls] It was one damn drink!

1066
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,056
[Mrs. Walls] That's a lie and you know it.

1067
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,915
- I can smell it on your sweat.
- Come on.

1068
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:07,159
[Mr. Walls] What are you,
a bloodhound all of a sudden?

1069
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,503
Why don't you go sniff
your own butt for a change

1070
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,273
'cause that ain't smelling too pretty
these days.

1071
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:13,578
That's very funny.
You're supposed to be at work right now

1072
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:14,967
or you're gonna lose another job!

1073
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,388
Well, why don't you go get a job instead
of wasting your time on all this crap?

1074
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,181
What the hell is this anyway?

1075
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:23,392
Abstract expressionism!

1076
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:25,978
Well, here's some realism for you!

1077
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,609
You're just like your mother.

1078
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:37,531
[clattering]

1079
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:40,534
Don't you touch me!

1080
01:08:40,618 --> 01:08:43,495
Get back here, you castrating whore.

1081
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:44,705
[Mrs. Walls] Hands off me!

1082
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,808
- [Mr. Walls] Come here.
- [Mrs. Walls] Get off of me!

1083
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,959
[fighting upstairs]

1084
01:08:49,043 --> 01:08:51,378
- [Lori] Maureen, you want to jump rope?
- [Maureen] Yeah.

1085
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:54,632
[Lori] Come on.

1086
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:57,092
[Mr. and Mrs. Walls arguing]

1087
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:59,386
- Ready?
- Get set. Go.

1088
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:03,599
- [windows open]
- [Mrs. Walls screaming]

1089
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:05,827
- [Mr. Walls] Come on. Get up here!
- [Mrs. Walls] Help!

1090
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:08,228
- [Mr. Walls] Goddammit
- [Jeannette] Mom! Hold on!

1091
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:14,845
[Mrs. Wall's screaming continues]

1092
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:20,032
- [Mrs. Walls] Help! Help me!
- [Jeannette] Mom!

1093
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,284
- Help! Don't help me!
- [Jeannette] Mom.

1094
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:25,120
- [Lori] Don't let her fall!
- [Jeannette] What did you do to her?

1095
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:26,997
[Mr. Walls] I didn't do anything!

1096
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:28,582
Get your hands off me!

1097
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,918
I don't think you want me to let go. Ow!

1098
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,045
- [Mr. Walls] She bit me!
- Just pull me in.

1099
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,588
[Mr. Walls] Goddammit!

1100
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:37,883
He's trying to kill me!

1101
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:41,291
- [Jeannette] Mom, are you okay?
- [Mrs. Walls] I'm okay.

1102
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,099
What do you mean is she okay?
Am I okay? She just bit me.

1103
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:47,059
Why did you push her?

1104
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:50,813
I didn't push her! She jumped!
I swear to God!

1105
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:54,942
You know she's crazy! You saw
she just bit me. I think she's broken...

1106
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:58,195
[Mr. Walls] Hey.

1107
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:12,376
[both laughing]

1108
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:20,342
[laughter continues]

1109
01:10:21,135 --> 01:10:23,345
You are one hell of a woman.

1110
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:24,763
You know that?

1111
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:28,267
And you're a stinky rotten drunk.

1112
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,770
But you love the stinky rotten drunk,
don't you?

1113
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:35,023
Oh, Rex.

1114
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,781
[both giggling]

1115
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,122
Hey, sweetie.

1116
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,921
You have to leave him.

1117
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:10,517
You know,
when your dad first met my mother,

1118
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:13,604
he asked her why she didn't have any
of my paintings on her walls.

1119
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,775
And she said she didn't want to encourage
a hobby with no future in it.

1120
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:22,780
He looked her right in the eye
and said, "To hell with the future.

1121
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:26,116
Masterpieces like these should be
on display right now."

1122
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:35,459
So he took down all other paintings.

1123
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,086
And put up mine.

1124
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:44,635
He's never going to change.

1125
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,224
You have to leave him.

1126
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:02,778
I can't.

1127
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,499
[Lori] Maureen, do you have any queens?

1128
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:16,583
Go fish.

1129
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,338
[Maureen] Brian, do you have any nines?

1130
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:23,423
[Brian] Go fish.

1131
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,051
We don't need them.

1132
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:32,766
They're never going to take care of us,
so we have to do it ourselves.

1133
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:36,395
We'll all go to school,
and start saving up

1134
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,118
so we can move out when we're old enough.

1135
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,025
If we're going to make it out of this,

1136
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,236
we have to do it together.

1137
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,530
[Jeanette] Deal?

1138
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:55,664
We are getting the heck out of here.

1139
01:12:57,749 --> 01:12:59,626
[acoustic guitar playing]

1140
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:16,518
[crowd cheering]

1141
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:18,520
[cheerleaders] Let's go, Knights!

1142
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:24,359
- [crowd applauds]
- [shutter clicks]

[indistinct chatter]

1144
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:40,375
...is the same as.

1145
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:43,211

1146
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:55,182
[music continues playing]

1147
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:09,571
[song ends]

1148
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:13,283
Miss Bivens asked me
to be editor of the paper next year.

1149
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,744
What? That's amazing.

1150
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:18,497
I swear by the time you graduate,

1151
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,980
you're gonna have every school
in New York fighting over you.

1152
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,798
They're here.

1153
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,471
[Jeannette] Don't worry about us.

1154
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,431
We'll be fine.

1155
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:39,059
Yeah.

1156
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,519
Hey uh...

1157
01:14:42,062 --> 01:14:43,647
I left five bucks in there.

1158
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:46,733
Start saving up, you're next.

1159
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:50,028
Dad's in the backyard.

1160
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:52,239
I think it's clear.

1161
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:54,783
[Lori] I love you guys.

1162
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:56,994
[Maureen] Love you.

1163
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,789
- [Lori] All right, bye.
- [Jeannette] Bye.

1164
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:02,592
- [Lori] I love you.
- [Jeannette] Love you.

[door closes]

1166
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:11,049
- [woman] Lori.
- [man] Let's go.

1167
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:13,319
[Mr. Walls] Hey, where the hell
do you think you're going?

1168
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,095
Guess it wasn't clear.

1169
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,458
- [Mr. Walls] Hey!
- [man] Hurry!

1170
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,533
- [Mr. Walls] I'm talking to you, girl!
- [man] Get in.

1171
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:20,934
[Mr. Walls] Get your ass out of that car
right now!

1172
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:22,477
[woman] Brad, go!

1173
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:44,458
[Mr. Walls] You know why she left?

1174
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:48,920
Huh?

1175
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:54,926
Brian?

1176
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,803
You know why she left?

1177
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:01,683
Maureen?

1178
01:16:10,317 --> 01:16:12,069
You gonna leave too?

1179
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:18,325
Answer me.

1180
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:21,035
Answer me!

1181
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:23,830
- Rex.
- Shut up!

1182
01:16:28,752 --> 01:16:29,753
No, sir.

1183
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,430
Who didn't take out the damn trash?

- [phone rings]
- [Jeannette] Lori?

1188
01:17:28,145 --> 01:17:29,771
<i>- Coast clear?</i>
- Yeah.

1189
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:31,982
He's passed out. How is everything?

1190
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:36,528
<i>Well, last night at the restaurant
I met a writing professor from Barnard.</i>

1191
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:39,823
<i>I told her you had applied to her school
and she was really nice about it.</i>

1192
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:42,242
<i>She said she'd be happy
to read your stuff.</i>

1193
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,828
- Are you serious?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1194
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,872
<i>She said to call her when you get up here.</i>

1195
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:48,623
That's amazing.

1196
01:17:48,707 --> 01:17:50,333
<i>How's the escape fund looking?</i>

1197
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:52,252
Oh, it's getting close.

1198
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:55,088
I think I've babysat every demon child
in Welch by now.

1199
01:17:55,172 --> 01:17:56,214
- You wanna hear?
<i>- Uh-hmm.</i>

1200
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:02,512
- Sounds like freedom.
<i>- Sure sounds fat.</i>

1201
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:07,267
<i>Oh, you're really gonna
love it here, Jeannette.</i>

1202
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:09,936
<i>It feels like you're breathing
for the first time.</i>

1203
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,774
I don't think he's gonna let me go.

1204
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:18,737
<i>Hey, come on. Don't even think about that.</i>

1205
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,656
<i>- It doesn't matter...</i>
- [glass shattering]

1206
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,782
<i>- What was that?</i>
- Hold on.

1207
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:24,951
- Can you call me back? Call me back.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1208
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,013
I'm sorry.

1209
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,268
Erma died.

1210
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:08,620
[inaudible]

1211
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,383
Do you think...

1212
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:25,011
Erma ever did something to Dad?

1213
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,389
Like what?

1214
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,395
Like what she did to Brian.

1215
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:39,234
You can't think about things like that.

1216
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:41,027
It'll make you crazy.

1217
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:48,743
I'm gonna meet you back at home.

1218
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:59,296
[bar music playing]

1219
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:05,635
[indistinct chatter]

1220
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:17,605
Dad...

1221
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,192
I'm sorry about Erma.

1222
01:20:22,944 --> 01:20:25,113
Time to go, you go.

1223
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:29,576
I'm not talking about that.

1224
01:20:33,288 --> 01:20:36,041
"It's impossible to breathe
when you're drowning in shit."

1225
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:48,337
- [man] Ready to lose that 40 bucks?
- [clears throat]

1226
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,227
[man] Pay me now or pay me later?

1227
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:58,146
[man 2]...40 bucks.

1228
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:59,939
You still believe in your old man?

1229
01:21:02,484 --> 01:21:04,903
You want to help me hustle this guy?

1230
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:06,196
Make some money?

1231
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:11,868
Yeah. Okay, so, as long as you stroke
his ego, he'll keep playing.

1232
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,788
I'll pull the plug.
The second we drain him...

1233
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:16,331
[clears throat]

1234
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:17,665
You know the drill.

1235
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,087
Robbie.

1236
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:26,299
- [Robbie] Hey, Rex.
- How are you?

1237
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:29,386
- [man] Who's that?
- My daughter.

1238
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,138
[indistinct chatter]

1239
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,608
Jeannette?

1240
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:46,361
Name's Robbie.

1241
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:49,239
I didn't know Rex had a daughter.

1242
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:53,159
He has three.

1243
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,371
Rex said you like to dance.

1244
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:04,087
[slow, country music playing]

1245
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,633
Do you like living in this town?

1246
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:12,637
It's all right.

1247
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,472
It ain't all right and you know it.

1248
01:22:15,849 --> 01:22:20,103
We're all mudbugs in the boiling pot.
Don't even know we're being cooked alive.

1249
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:22,272
[Jeannette chuckles]

1250
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:27,318
I'm heading off to Chicago
as soon as I can afford up savings for it.

1251
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,321
What 'bout you?

1252
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:37,787
I'm saving up to move up to New York City
to be with my sister.

1253
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:40,248
All right.

1254
01:22:41,374 --> 01:22:42,750
The Big Apple.

1255
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,502
I like that city.

1256
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:46,546
I've been there a couple times.

1257
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:48,882
You're gonna love it.

1258
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:53,636
Yep.

1259
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:59,976
Hey, Robbie. Do something worthwhile
with those damn hands of yours.

1260
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:01,519
Get over here, play a game.

1261
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:06,107
Well, all right.

1262
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:11,738
[Mr. Walls] Side pocket.

1263
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,281
Sure about that, Rex?

1264
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:18,286
- Ooh.
- [Robbie] Damn!

1265
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:22,165
Four games in a damn row.

1266
01:23:22,624 --> 01:23:25,376
That'll be 80 bucks
unless you want to go double or noth'.

1267
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,755
Nope, take it all.

1268
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:32,342
- You deserve it.
- Here you go. Wash down that humble pie.

1269
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:36,971
To your daughter.

1270
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:40,016
And her big move to New York City.

1271
01:23:44,312 --> 01:23:46,314
To New York City, huh?

1272
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:56,491
Can't believe I let that old fart take me.

1273
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:58,868
I don't know if I'm ticked or impressed.

1274
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:07,961
Hey, you know my apartment
is right upstairs.

1275
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,296
Got a bunch of records
laying on that jukebox,

1276
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,298
if you want to come up and listen a bit.

1277
01:24:12,924 --> 01:24:14,634
Thanks, but I can't.

1278
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:19,097
Rex, you mind if I bring
your daughter upstairs for a bit,

1279
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,765
listen to some records?

1280
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:29,232
She's a big city girl now,
she can handle herself.

1281
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:33,695
Holler if you need me.

1282
01:24:54,674 --> 01:24:56,860
- You know, I can't stay long.
- [Robbie] That's all right.

1283
01:24:56,884 --> 01:24:59,887
I just want a light tune or two.

1284
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:04,100
I think you're gonna like this one.

1285
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,936
[dance music begins playing]

1286
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:12,358
Where were we?

1287
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:19,407
I think we were dancing.
Sort of like this.

1288
01:25:24,704 --> 01:25:27,790
Trying to sniff my hair?
What are you doing?

1289
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,378
- Oh.
- That's what I was trying to do.

1290
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:34,631
Oh, I'm not that kind of girl.

1291
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,595
Oh, we'll just dance then, all right?

1292
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:48,770
Oh. How'd that happen?

1293
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:53,983
Okay. Robbie, what are you doing?

1294
01:25:54,734 --> 01:25:56,277
- Stop.
- Whoa.

1295
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:58,655
I just want to see what you
got underneath this dress.

1296
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,615
Robbie, stop.

1297
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:03,117
Easy. Take it easy.

1298
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:05,119
- Robbie.
- It's all right.

1299
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:06,996
Hey. Hey.

1300
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:09,666
Let me show you.

1301
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:23,888
Okay.

1302
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,265
There you go.

1303
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:35,024
- [Robbie] Whoa.
- Uh-hmm.

1304
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:39,320
When I was a little girl,
I lit myself on fire.

1305
01:26:42,156 --> 01:26:44,033
It gets worse down there.

1306
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,748
I'm gonna go now.

1307
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:57,130
[door closes]

1308
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:14,063
I knew you could handle yourself.

1309
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:21,154
Just like that time I taught you to swim.

1310
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:25,199
You thought you was gonna drown,
but I knew you'd do just fine.

1311
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:34,959
We'll cut it here.

1312
01:27:37,587 --> 01:27:39,046
Here's your cut.

1313
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,634
Take it or not?

1314
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:46,429
Might come in handy for the big move.

1315
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:54,687
I don't care what Erma did to you.

1316
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:58,524
There's no excuse.

1317
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:04,781
I am moving to New York.
There's nothing that you can do about it.

1318
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:16,459
- You okay?
- I need to get the hell out of here.

1319
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,474
[door opens]

1320
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,477
[door closes]

1321
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:45,112
Well, somebody sure gutted
your piggy didn't they?

1322
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,532
Any suspects?

1323
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:51,619
That money was mine.

1324
01:29:12,723 --> 01:29:14,600
Why are you doing this to us, Dad?

1325
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:26,445
[phone ringing]

1326
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,031
[continues]

1327
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,871
<i>New York Magazine,</i>
this is Jeannette Walls.

1328
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:36,622
[Maureen] <i>Hey, big shot.</i>

1329
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:38,666
Maureen?

1330
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:40,626
How's your fancy life?

1331
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:44,380
<i>[laughs] Just getting ready
for my fancy engagement party.</i>

1332
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:45,798
We're excited to see you.

1333
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:48,551
<i>I can't make it tonight.</i>

1334
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,428
<i>Why not?</i>

1335
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:53,639
'Cause I'm moving to California.

1336
01:29:54,223 --> 01:29:55,725
<i>You're not serious.</i>

1337
01:29:57,852 --> 01:29:59,729
Maureen, you can't go to California.

1338
01:30:01,147 --> 01:30:02,899
That's the other side of the country.

1339
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:05,985
We have to stick together. We always have.

1340
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:09,947
That's not true.

1341
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:13,367
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1342
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:14,993
<i>I love you.</i>

1343
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:16,412
[hangs up]

1344
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:19,832
Why would she go to California?

1345
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,836
It's as far away from them
as she can get without swimming to Hawaii.

1346
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:28,132
It's our fault.

1347
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:31,135
We should have never
left her alone with them.

1348
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:37,308
She would have hated us anyway.

1349
01:30:37,391 --> 01:30:38,809
[doorbell dings]

1350
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:40,603
David sure doesn't.

1351
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:42,104
Thank you so much for coming.

1352
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:44,774
- Who needs more bubbly?
- [Mrs. Walls] We do.

1353
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:48,861
Hi, handsome.

1354
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:50,237
Did you invite them?

1355
01:30:51,656 --> 01:30:52,657
Oops.

1356
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:56,327
- Look who's here. Oh!
- Okay.

1357
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,413
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1358
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:01,332
This will be interesting.

1359
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:02,935
[Mr. Walls] Let's get this party started.

1360
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:06,295
Congratulations, honey.

1361
01:31:08,673 --> 01:31:12,885
What does an investment banker
use as birth control?

1362
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:17,139
- His personality.
- [all laughing]

1363
01:31:17,223 --> 01:31:18,516
[Mr. Walls] Alright, one more.

1364
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:20,935
What's the difference between
a bag of manure on your lawn

1365
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:23,413
- and an investment banker?
- Can I speak with you for a second?

1366
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:25,314
Right in the middle of a punchline.

1367
01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:27,149
Okay, hold that thought, gents.

1368
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:28,734
- [men groaning]
- [man 1] All right.

1369
01:31:28,818 --> 01:31:30,027
[man 2] Who is that guy?

1370
01:31:35,408 --> 01:31:36,575
Swanky.

1371
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:38,869
I don't see one of your mama's paintings.

1372
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:41,622
What are you doing here?

1373
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:46,085
Well, just networkin'
with all these fantastic people.

1374
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:49,672
Every time someone leaves
you act like a child.

1375
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:52,008
You think you'd be used to it by now.

1376
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:54,552
What's that supposed to mean?

1377
01:31:54,635 --> 01:31:56,470
It's not a surprise, Dad.

1378
01:31:57,471 --> 01:32:00,099
Maureen left because your bullshit
drove her crazy.

1379
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:04,145
You really want to talk
about bullshit right now?

1380
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:07,898
Look around. This ain't you.

1381
01:32:07,982 --> 01:32:10,026
You ain't like those pawns
and you know it.

1382
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:11,444
Don't turn this on me.

1383
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,945
You're a Walls.

1384
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:16,532
You were born to change the world,
not just add to the noise.

1385
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:18,868
You cannot marry that fool.

1386
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:22,747
You're better than him and you're better
than that goddamn gossip column.

1387
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:24,373
You're a real writer.

1388
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:27,209
I like my life, Dad.

1389
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:31,505
Well then why is all your crap
packed up in those boxes?

1390
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,551
What's going on guys?

1391
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,637
We don't want to upset David.

1392
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:41,140
Why do you care so much about David
all of the sudden?

1393
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:45,311
Well, he's like, part of the family now.
Right, honey?

1394
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:47,563
Hey, hey, hey. This is not the time.

1395
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:50,066
- Well when's the right time?
- Not right now, okay?

1396
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:51,543
Well, there were three more offers today.

1397
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:53,319
So you can wait till tomorrow.

1398
01:32:53,402 --> 01:32:54,945
- I had to tell her.
- Tell me what?

1399
01:32:55,029 --> 01:32:56,715
- Trust me now is not the time.
- Tell me what, Mom?

1400
01:32:56,739 --> 01:32:58,115
Let me talk!

1401
01:33:01,077 --> 01:33:03,120
You know how I was telling you
about my brother

1402
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:05,581
selling his half of Mom's land in Texas?

1403
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:10,753
Well, now that you're getting married
and you have all these nice things...

1404
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:18,052
we were thinking that maybe we could...
borrow the money to buy it.

1405
01:33:18,803 --> 01:33:22,515
So the only reason why you're being nice
to David is because you want his money?

1406
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:26,477
No, it's not the only reason.
I'm also just a nice person.

1407
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,854
- You are a nice person.
- Thank you.

1408
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:31,857
We wouldn't ask
if it wasn't urgent, honey.

1409
01:33:32,525 --> 01:33:33,526
How much?

1410
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,653
- Let's not get into...
- About a million.

1411
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:39,365
A million dollars.

1412
01:33:39,907 --> 01:33:41,033
A little under.

1413
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:43,619
A little under.

1414
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:48,499
Well if Uncle Jim's land is worth
that much than yours is too.

1415
01:33:48,582 --> 01:33:51,210
Well, I don't know,
I've never had it appraised.

1416
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:55,464
I-I... My father taught me,
you never sell land.

1417
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:57,842
- [Mr. Walls] Good advice.
- [Mrs. Walls] Right.

1418
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,263
Grandma Smith died when I was 11.

1419
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:07,309
Have you been sitting on
a million dollars since I was 11?

1420
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:11,814
No, no. It appreciates over time.
It escalates.

1421
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:13,816
You knew about this?

1422
01:34:15,985 --> 01:34:18,279
You realize what we could have done
with that money?

1423
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:21,157
I don't want my kids raised
on a goddamn handout.

1424
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:22,658
What the hell?

1425
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:24,243
What the hell is wrong with you?

1426
01:34:26,287 --> 01:34:27,663
Nice, Rose.

1427
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:31,750
[Mr. Walls] Hey, Mountain Goat.

1428
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:33,586
Don't ever call me that again.

1429
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,005
- Uh, Jeannette.
- [Jeannette] David, please.

1430
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:37,840
Come on. I know you're upset,

1431
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,860
but let's just go back
and talk about this. Come on.

1432
01:34:39,884 --> 01:34:43,095
Dad. Why do you think all of us
ran away from you?

1433
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:45,097
We were drowning.

1434
01:34:46,015 --> 01:34:49,101
I still don't understand
why you followed us here.

1435
01:34:49,185 --> 01:34:51,437
We wanted to be a family again.

1436
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,231
We were never a family, Mom.
We were a nightmare.

1437
01:34:54,315 --> 01:34:56,942
Your mom and I did everything
we could for you, okay?

1438
01:34:57,026 --> 01:34:58,360
We looked after you...

1439
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,613
- and it was a happy family.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

1440
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:01,864
[Jeannette] We did it!

1441
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:05,159
We took care of each other
because you were too drunk to.

1442
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:11,540
It was your job to protect us
and you didn't even try.

1443
01:35:11,624 --> 01:35:13,709
That ain't true, okay?

1444
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,395
- You got some kind of weird revisionist...
- [Jeannette] It is true.

1445
01:35:15,419 --> 01:35:16,545
history going on.

1446
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:18,088
- You were a happy kid.
- Dad...

1447
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:19,774
- stop talking.
- And they were happy kids.

1448
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:21,234
- Stop talking!
- And we looked after you!

1449
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:22,968
- And...
- Stop talking!

1450
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:24,762
Talking is not trying!

1451
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:28,641
You talked my whole goddamn life!

1452
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,853
I believed you.

1453
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:36,023
- Come on.
- Don't.

1454
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,680
[Mr. Walls] Hey, don't do this.

1455
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:40,236
I don't want you in my life.

1456
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,256
- Jeannette, you do not mean that.
- I don't want you to call,

1457
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,115
or write,
or show up out of the blue.

1458
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,493
I don't want another one
of your bullshit stories.

1459
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:49,286
I don't want to see you anymore.

1460
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:11,016
I gotta go.

1461
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:14,353
See you soon, little sister.

1462
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:46,427
I think I figured out how to deal
with the lack of sunlight on the hillside.

1463
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:51,890
I just need to install specially
curved mirrors to all solar cells.

1464
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,953
- See what I was thinking was you don't...
- Dad.

1465
01:36:54,977 --> 01:36:55,978
go right away.

1466
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:57,938
- You could just uh...
- Dad.

1467
01:36:58,022 --> 01:36:59,523
you could finish school here

1468
01:36:59,606 --> 01:37:01,525
- and get a job at the <i>Welch Daily News</i>
- Dad.

1469
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:04,028
- and I will help you write those articles.
- I am going.

1470
01:37:04,111 --> 01:37:06,322
Remember how we used to do that?

1471
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:07,948
You remember that?

1472
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,493
You are never going to build
the glass castle.

1473
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:13,162
- Oh, I am.
- You're not.

1474
01:37:13,245 --> 01:37:14,538
I am.

1475
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:17,499
- Um, I got it right there.
- And even if you do, it doesn't matter.

1476
01:37:19,043 --> 01:37:20,919
I'm getting on the first bus out of here.

1477
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:24,381
- Well.
- If the bus breaks down, I'm gonna walk.

1478
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,425
I am gonna finish this thing.

1479
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:29,386
- I can guaran-goddamn-tee it.
- I will hitchhike if I have to, Dad.

1480
01:37:30,429 --> 01:37:33,474
Build it if you want,
but don't build it for me.

1481
01:37:33,557 --> 01:37:35,893
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Jeannette.

1482
01:37:38,729 --> 01:37:40,731
- Mountain Goat!
- [door closes]

1483
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:08,467
Okay, so I'm gonna pick you up after work

1484
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,636
and we'll head straight
to the restaurant from there.

1485
01:38:11,345 --> 01:38:12,721
Where?

1486
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:14,932
We have dinner
with Mr. Lehocky and his wife.

1487
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:19,853
Jeannette, remember I told you about this?

1488
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:23,625
Furniture designer? This guy's got more
money than he knows what to do with it.

1489
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:25,289
He made the chair that you're sitting in.

1490
01:38:26,693 --> 01:38:29,738
Oh, right. The furniture designer.
I... Yeah, I got it.

1491
01:38:31,448 --> 01:38:32,449
Jeannette, please.

1492
01:38:33,617 --> 01:38:35,411
This is a very big account, okay?

1493
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:36,745
It's huge for us.

1494
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,123
I said I got it.

1495
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:41,750
- [phone rings]
- Okay. Can you get that? I got to go.

1496
01:38:41,834 --> 01:38:42,918
Uh-huh.

1497
01:38:43,419 --> 01:38:46,296
[ringing continues]

1498
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,068
- [answering machine beeps]
- [Mrs. Walls] <i>Jeannette?</i>

1499
01:38:50,092 --> 01:38:51,969
<i>It's me, sweetie.</i>

1500
01:38:52,886 --> 01:38:55,055
<i>It's been too long.</i>

1501
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:57,558
<i>You can't ignore us forever, honey.</i>

1502
01:38:58,892 --> 01:39:01,437
<i>Just really need to talk to you
about something.</i>

1503
01:39:02,563 --> 01:39:04,606
<i>- Okay?</i>
- [hangs up]

1504
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:09,611
Have you been to the Picasso Retrospective
up at MoMA yet?

1505
01:39:09,695 --> 01:39:11,864
- Mom.
- Oh, don't, don't waste your time.

1506
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:15,200
He really didn't do anything worthwhile
after his Rose Period.

1507
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:17,369
All that cubist stuff is so gimmicky.

1508
01:39:17,453 --> 01:39:19,830
Mom, I have to go back to work.
Why are you here?

1509
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:23,876
I-I-I need to sit down.

1510
01:39:27,713 --> 01:39:31,341
You know how I am
with sentimental situations like this.

1511
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:33,844
I just...

1512
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:36,680
I don't know what to do.

1513
01:39:38,807 --> 01:39:40,225
What's going on?

1514
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:45,147
Your dad's sick.

1515
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,399
And he's not getting better.

1516
01:39:48,317 --> 01:39:50,277
He stopped talking last week.

1517
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,031
Well, what does that mean?

1518
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:56,783
Oh, he was ranting about
that night at David's.

1519
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:59,953
All that stuff he said
about his drinking and...

1520
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:03,874
how talking isn't trying
and whatever else he said

1521
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,877
And then he asked me
if I think he talks too much

1522
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,754
and I said yeah 'cause he does.

1523
01:40:10,756 --> 01:40:12,424
And then he just stopped.

1524
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:17,554
Hasn't said a word since.

1525
01:40:20,516 --> 01:40:23,352
Won't get out of bed. Barely eats.

1526
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:25,771
Sounds as awful.

1527
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:34,071
He's dying, Jeannette.

1528
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:39,993
You have a right to be angry.

1529
01:40:40,077 --> 01:40:41,620
And you think I don't know that?

1530
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,038
Of course you do.

1531
01:40:45,582 --> 01:40:48,210
Look, I don't want to tell you
what to do, ever.

1532
01:40:50,337 --> 01:40:52,839
But I know you love him and I just think

1533
01:40:52,923 --> 01:40:55,801
you'll regret it if you don't come home
and say good-bye.

1534
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:04,351
Mom, I said good-bye a long time ago.

1535
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:05,644
Jeannette.

1536
01:41:09,398 --> 01:41:12,568
The doctor told him a month if
he stops drinking which he won't.

1537
01:41:12,651 --> 01:41:14,611
So who knows.

1538
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,656
What exactly is it?

1539
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:20,993
Pretty much everything you can get from
four packs of cigarettes

1540
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:23,412
and two quarts of booze
every day for 50 years.

1541
01:41:24,288 --> 01:41:25,706
He doesn't look good.

1542
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:28,125
You have to go see him.

1543
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:32,546
No, I don't.

1544
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:35,215
You're right, you don't...

1545
01:41:37,134 --> 01:41:38,969
but you kinda do.

1546
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:41,530
He's done a lot of shitty things but...

1547
01:41:43,724 --> 01:41:45,058
he's had his moments.

1548
01:41:51,273 --> 01:41:53,567
[people laughing]

1549
01:41:54,651 --> 01:41:56,236
[sighs]

1550
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:01,366
[Mr. Walls] Daddy in the hall!

1551
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:03,744
Does anybody know where
Jeannette's room is?

1552
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:06,913
Oh, thank you kindly, ma'am.

1553
01:42:06,997 --> 01:42:12,044
[howling]

1554
01:42:13,253 --> 01:42:14,796
What are you snoseling about?

1555
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,090
What are you doing here?

1556
01:42:17,174 --> 01:42:22,429
Uh, I thought I'd finally come check out
this high falutin' college of yours.

1557
01:42:22,512 --> 01:42:26,058
I gotta say for the tuition,
I expected a bit more.

1558
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:33,398
Your mom says that you're jumping ship.

1559
01:42:34,316 --> 01:42:36,443
What happened to all
your fancy scholarships?

1560
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,613
It isn't enough.

1561
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:43,533
And they don't cut a break for poor little
country girls with big dreams?

1562
01:42:44,117 --> 01:42:45,619
I didn't say I didn't warn you.

1563
01:42:45,702 --> 01:42:48,789
Did you come all the way here from Welch
just to rub it in my face?

1564
01:42:49,665 --> 01:42:51,375
You were right, okay?

1565
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,960
I never should have come here
and now I'm dropping out.

1566
01:42:54,044 --> 01:42:55,545
The hell you are.

1567
01:43:00,425 --> 01:43:04,805
That's $950 and uh,

1568
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:09,685
that there is genuine 100% mink.

1569
01:43:09,768 --> 01:43:12,229
You should be able to pawn that
for at least 50.

1570
01:43:14,648 --> 01:43:16,358
Where did you get all this?

1571
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:21,279
New York City's full of poker players who
wouldn't know their ass from their elbows

1572
01:43:21,363 --> 01:43:24,449
and your ma said I finally had
a good reason to gamble.

1573
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,745
You did this for me?

1574
01:43:29,329 --> 01:43:32,874
Since when is it wrong for a father
to take care of his little girl?

1575
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:36,461
[sentimental music playing]

1576
01:43:43,343 --> 01:43:45,846
So it turns out Mrs. Lehocky
is actually a fan of yours.

1577
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:47,931
She reads your column every week.

1578
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:50,976
Rich, white and old
is our target audience.

1579
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:57,983
I heard your Mom's message on the machine.

1580
01:43:59,067 --> 01:44:00,610
Is something going on?

1581
01:44:02,529 --> 01:44:04,406
Ah, it's just Mom-being-Mom.

1582
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,869
You know, whatever they want...

1583
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:11,913
please don't give in.

1584
01:44:13,331 --> 01:44:15,208
You've been so much better without them.

1585
01:44:19,796 --> 01:44:21,339
Have I?

1586
01:44:25,552 --> 01:44:28,805
We've been a team so long
it's hard to tell who does what anymore.

1587
01:44:29,431 --> 01:44:31,683
But Ollie's always been
a master craftsman

1588
01:44:31,767 --> 01:44:33,769
and I'm more of a visual person.

1589
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:35,854
Vi's the real artist of the operation.

1590
01:44:35,937 --> 01:44:37,481
I just make sure they don't fall apart

1591
01:44:37,564 --> 01:44:39,483
- when you sit down.
- [chuckling]

1592
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:43,028
But when we were your age, we didn't
think any of this was going to happen.

1593
01:44:43,111 --> 01:44:47,532
We would've been fine making chairs out of
a tiny garage for the rest of our lives.

1594
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,284
Ah, just do what makes you happy.

1595
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:51,203
You may make some money and you might not.

1596
01:44:51,745 --> 01:44:53,985
It don't matter either way
if you're doing what you love.

1597
01:44:54,998 --> 01:44:58,418
And what about you Jeannette?
Is this what you've always wanted to do?

1598
01:45:01,046 --> 01:45:03,757
Um, no, actually.

1599
01:45:04,758 --> 01:45:06,760
I was once a political science major.

1600
01:45:07,302 --> 01:45:11,890
I was very eager to write stories
that would actually matter.

1601
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:13,767
[Vi] Your stories matter to me.

1602
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,060
Thank you.

1603
01:45:16,186 --> 01:45:18,146
I don't know. It's just um,

1604
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:20,524
this is not where
I thought that I was gonna end up.

1605
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:22,984
Well, maybe you're not at the end yet.

1606
01:45:27,739 --> 01:45:30,867
Jeannette's dad is developing
a technology to burn

1607
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:33,411
low-grade bituminous coal
more efficiently.

1608
01:45:34,037 --> 01:45:36,957
- [Vi] Well, isn't that nice?
- [Ollie] Hmm.

1609
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:39,209
[Vi] Where's your dad now?

1610
01:45:39,292 --> 01:45:40,293
Oh.

1611
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:43,046
[sighs]

1612
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:48,260
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me for a sec?

1613
01:45:53,348 --> 01:45:54,724
[sighs]

1614
01:46:06,111 --> 01:46:07,279
[Mr. Walls] There.

1615
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:09,364
How does that feel?

1616
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:16,496
It's so ugly, Daddy.
I look like the demon.

1617
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:21,001
Hey. There's nothing ugly about you.
You hear me?

1618
01:46:22,711 --> 01:46:24,713
One day I promise you,
you're gonna look at this

1619
01:46:24,796 --> 01:46:28,216
as just another side of
how strong you are.

1620
01:46:30,802 --> 01:46:32,762
You're a Walls, Mountain Goat.

1621
01:46:33,638 --> 01:46:35,640
And we ain't like other people.

1622
01:46:35,724 --> 01:46:39,019
We got a fire burning in our bellies.

1623
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:41,771
And that there is goddamn proof of it.

1624
01:46:45,525 --> 01:46:46,525
Now...

1625
01:46:47,652 --> 01:46:52,073
this knife is especially designed
to hunt demons.

1626
01:46:53,408 --> 01:46:54,618
It's very sharp.

1627
01:46:55,243 --> 01:46:57,495
Don't take it out unless you see him.

1628
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:03,043
You can borrow it for the night.

1629
01:47:06,296 --> 01:47:09,174
You know, all monsters are the same.

1630
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:13,887
They like to frighten people,
but the minute you stare 'em down,

1631
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,139
they turn tail and run.

1632
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:25,148
I love you, Mountain Goat.

1633
01:47:36,034 --> 01:47:37,661
[sighs]

1634
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:46,628
[exhales]

1635
01:47:53,885 --> 01:47:56,447
[David] I think that it expands the
business and then there's a...

1636
01:47:56,471 --> 01:48:01,017
[sighs] My parents are squatting in an
abandoned building on the Lower East Side.

1637
01:48:01,101 --> 01:48:02,701
- [David] Jeannette.
- They were homeless

1638
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:05,563
for three years before that which
is pretty much how they raised us.

1639
01:48:06,773 --> 01:48:09,901
My dad is not developing
a technology for bituminous coal,

1640
01:48:09,985 --> 01:48:12,487
but he could tell you anything
that you want to know about it.

1641
01:48:13,488 --> 01:48:15,573
He is the smartest man that I know.

1642
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:19,244
He is also a drunk.

1643
01:48:19,327 --> 01:48:23,540
[inhales] Never finishes what he starts
and can be extremely cruel.

1644
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:26,960
But he dreams bigger
than anyone I've ever met.

1645
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:29,254
And he never tries to be somebody
that he's not.

1646
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:33,299
He never wanted me to either.

1647
01:48:42,392 --> 01:48:44,519
I'm sorry, but I have to leave.

1648
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:52,944
Go.

1649
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:08,752
You ready to go get that demon?

1650
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:16,551
[both howling]

1651
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:18,094
Let's go!

1652
01:49:18,178 --> 01:49:19,596
[sentimental music playing]

1653
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:39,491
[song ends]

1654
01:49:39,574 --> 01:49:40,700
[exhales]

1655
01:50:00,178 --> 01:50:01,429
[Mrs. Walls sighs]

1656
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:10,772
I'll go get some air.

1657
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:12,732
I'll leave you to it.

1658
01:50:17,821 --> 01:50:18,988
[door closes]

1659
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:24,160
Hey, Dad.

1660
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:48,226
Do you remember when those grape pickers
in California went on strike?

1661
01:50:49,144 --> 01:50:51,980
And the vineyards had to sell everything
for a nickel a pound?

1662
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:57,110
You stuffed the car so full,
we couldn't see out the windows.

1663
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:03,199
Brian found some in his pocket two weeks
later that had turned into raisins.

1664
01:51:06,953 --> 01:51:10,915
Or when you let me pet that
cheetah at the zoo.

1665
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:20,967
She was licking that
popcorn butter off your hand.

1666
01:51:22,677 --> 01:51:25,555
Those other parents wanted
to chop my head off.

1667
01:51:28,224 --> 01:51:29,559
They were just jealous.

1668
01:51:34,647 --> 01:51:38,067
[inhales] Remember when
you made your own braces?

1669
01:51:39,194 --> 01:51:42,280
You were a goddamn freakin'
engineering genius.

1670
01:51:43,239 --> 01:51:45,200
It was a hanger and a rubber band.

1671
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:47,660
By God, worked.

1672
01:51:50,121 --> 01:51:52,498
Look at those gorgeous chompers.

1673
01:51:52,582 --> 01:51:54,250
[laughing]

1674
01:52:02,425 --> 01:52:04,928
Oh, Mom says
you haven't been talking lately.

1675
01:52:14,145 --> 01:52:15,605
[coughing]

1676
01:52:19,442 --> 01:52:20,652
[groans]

1677
01:52:20,735 --> 01:52:23,655
It's 'cause I'm taking some time to think.

1678
01:52:25,698 --> 01:52:27,492
[groans]

1679
01:52:29,035 --> 01:52:30,370
Here.

1680
01:52:36,584 --> 01:52:37,669
What's this?

1681
01:52:39,003 --> 01:52:41,714
It's every story
you've written since eighth grade.

1682
01:52:44,342 --> 01:52:46,803
I thought maybe
you could start adding to it for me.

1683
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:09,325
[Mr. Walls clears throat]

1684
01:53:12,537 --> 01:53:14,247
I've spent my whole...

1685
01:53:15,331 --> 01:53:16,582
life...

1686
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:21,296
hunting for those demons
in the wild and...

1687
01:53:22,714 --> 01:53:26,843
the entire time
they were hiding inside my own body.

1688
01:53:35,268 --> 01:53:37,687
Sad state to spend your life in.

1689
01:53:39,063 --> 01:53:41,149
Being afraid of your own self.

1690
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:48,448
I know it...

1691
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:52,452
wasn't easy on you kids.

1692
01:54:01,586 --> 01:54:04,756
I've got a lot to regret about my life.

1693
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:07,008
Dad.

1694
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:15,308
Never forget...

1695
01:54:16,684 --> 01:54:19,479
how beautiful you are, Mountain Goat.

1696
01:54:21,356 --> 01:54:27,528
And smart and creative and strong.

1697
01:54:29,489 --> 01:54:31,366
You're so strong.

1698
01:54:31,449 --> 01:54:32,909
[chuckles]

1699
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:41,209
No little girl should ever
have to carry her daddy on her back.

1700
01:54:45,088 --> 01:54:46,506
[exhales]

1701
01:54:49,467 --> 01:54:51,677
You ain't like me at all, Mountain Goat.

1702
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:55,348
You're not afraid to...

1703
01:55:01,187 --> 01:55:02,897
I am like you.

1704
01:55:06,651 --> 01:55:07,860
And I'm glad.

1705
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:16,911
We had some good times, didn't we?

1706
01:55:25,545 --> 01:55:28,047
We never did build that glass castle.

1707
01:55:31,634 --> 01:55:32,885
No.

1708
01:55:35,805 --> 01:55:37,765
But we had a good time planning it.

1709
01:55:49,569 --> 01:55:51,195

1711
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:18,764
Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

1712
01:56:18,848 --> 01:56:20,576
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Something smells good.

1713
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,268
How's life as a freelancer?

1714
01:56:22,351 --> 01:56:25,271
- I'm still getting used to it.
- Yeah, you like being poor again?

1715
01:56:25,354 --> 01:56:27,374
- [Jeannette] Thanks, Brian.
- [Brian] Careful with my child.

1716
01:56:27,398 --> 01:56:28,858
- [Maureen] Hey.
- Maureen.

1717
01:56:28,941 --> 01:56:31,461
- [Brian] I like your new place.
- [Jeannette] How's California?

1718
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:32,904
It's really nice. It's sunny.

1719
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:34,906
Here's your housewarming present.

1720
01:56:35,573 --> 01:56:37,909
I thought you'd like one of him.

1721
01:56:37,992 --> 01:56:40,453
I didn't do so well with the hair, but

1722
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:42,580
do you like it, honey?

1723
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:45,082
It's perfect.

1724
01:56:46,751 --> 01:56:49,212
Wait. What? What?

1725
01:56:49,879 --> 01:56:52,590
- I never told you about this?
- No you didn't.

1726
01:56:52,673 --> 01:56:54,592
He didn't have money for presents,

1727
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,511
so he takes each of us outside,

1728
01:56:56,594 --> 01:56:59,180
and says that we could
just pick out our own star.

1729
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:01,098
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1730
01:57:01,182 --> 01:57:03,684
Anyone we want, so you know,
I took uh, Rigel.

1731
01:57:03,768 --> 01:57:06,187
It's that little blue, little blue one
on the foot of Orion.

1732
01:57:06,687 --> 01:57:08,773
Yeah. What was yours, Lori?

1733
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:12,360
Well, I chose Beetlejuice 'cause it was
this pretty shade of red.

1734
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:15,563
Then later that night Dad told me, it was
only that color because it was dying.

1735
01:57:15,613 --> 01:57:18,074
That's right. You got the dud!

1736
01:57:18,157 --> 01:57:19,659
You were so mad.

1737
01:57:19,742 --> 01:57:21,661
Yeah 'cause he wouldn't let me
pick a new one.

1738
01:57:21,744 --> 01:57:23,746
There's no return policies in outer space.

1739
01:57:23,829 --> 01:57:26,916
Right? Well that only works for plastic
toys made in Japan.

1740
01:57:29,877 --> 01:57:31,754
[Brian] But he also said...

1741
01:57:32,713 --> 01:57:35,883
"When everyone else's junk
is broken and forgotten,

1742
01:57:35,967 --> 01:57:37,802
you'll still have your stars."

1743
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:41,847
[Lori] Yeah.

1744
01:57:47,353 --> 01:57:49,673
- [Brian] Jeannette, what's going on?
- [Maureen] You okay?

1745
01:57:50,606 --> 01:57:52,775
[Mrs. Walls] What are
you thinking, sweetie?

1746
01:57:56,862 --> 01:57:58,823
I ju... I just...

1747
01:58:01,409 --> 01:58:04,453
I feel really lucky.

1748
01:58:08,249 --> 01:58:10,376
[Mrs. Walls] That's so sweet.

1749
01:58:11,669 --> 01:58:13,921
Let's make a toast to Rex.

1750
01:58:14,672 --> 01:58:15,965
Yeah.

1751
01:58:16,048 --> 01:58:20,052
A life with your father was never boring.

1752
01:58:20,136 --> 01:58:21,762

1753
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:35,086
[woman]
All these here are portraits of people.

1754
01:59:35,169 --> 01:59:37,713
I have a whole box of flowers back there.

1755
01:59:37,797 --> 01:59:41,425
Down here, people like my flowers
better than they did in New York.

1756
01:59:41,509 --> 01:59:42,802
[chickens clucking]

1757
01:59:42,885 --> 01:59:46,013
You know Jeannette's story about how
he gave her a star?

1758
01:59:46,097 --> 01:59:48,891
What a difference between Lori's
and Jeannette's.

1759
01:59:48,974 --> 01:59:52,853
"Jeannette, I got a star.
Oh, Daddy, you're so wonderful."

1760
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,106
"I love you."

1761
01:59:56,148 --> 02:00:00,152
And Lori says, "You goddamn son of
a bitch, you did have enough money."

Dad loved grand gestures

1769

that preferably did not require
a whole lot of follow up.

1770

by the city officials using
taxpayers money to tear down buildings

1789

so that they can give away
the property to the goddamn developers.

So the developers
will pay 'em off under the table.
