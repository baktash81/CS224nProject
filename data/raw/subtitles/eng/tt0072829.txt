244
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,225
Cheryl, that your daddy
was in the air force

245
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,183
and must have died for his country.

246
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,184
We need gas, Mama.

247
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,600
I feel like California's a sink.

248
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,475
Someone pulled the plug out on us.

Like we're just gonna go
gurglin' right down the drain.

Seems like we never shoulda come west.

251
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,725
Headin' west was the
start of all our trouble.

252
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,850
No, Daniel and the farm

253
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,642
was the start of all our troubles.

254
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,225
What the heck we gonna do now?

255
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:15,350
You need a home, baby.

256
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,475
That's what you really need.

257
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,433
Any one of your dads would
have made a home for you

258
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,475
with grass and trees.

259
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:23,308
Real trees. Oak trees, mountains, uh.

260
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,101
That's right.

261
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,225
I'm gonna get it all for you, baby.

263
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,558
We're going back to Jerusalem, Arkansas.

264
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:29,100
What the heck for?

265
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:30,683
I'm gonna buy back our farm.

266
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:31,725
[Sheba] What!

267
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:33,808
I'm gonna buy it with
good solid, honest cash

268
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,267
and nobody can never take
it away from us again.

269
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,558
You got any idea where
we're gonna be tonight?

270
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:41,267
Yes, we're gonna be in.

Now Melba, just hold up here.

274
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,558
Now, you're traveling too fast.

275
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,683
We're gonna buy back
the Stokes 60 acres.

276
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:56,767
Cotton, soy beans, chickens,
pigs, horses, mules.

277
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,308
Mama's gonna sell eggs and milk.

278
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:00,350
Yee hoo!

279
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:02,517
String beans and ripe red tomatoes,

280

281
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,433
And dirt and mules and worms.

282
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,434
And worms.

283
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,517
No, I think you're
running a fever, Mama.

284
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,808
If I am, I don't want you
to tell me about it, Cheryl.

285
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:12,975
I'm gonna be sick.

286
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,267
Not yet.

289
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,226
Hold it right in.

290
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,517
And if we have to, we'll buy
the bank that took our farm.

291
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,933
No more loan company.

292
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:22,433
Paid, everything!

293
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:23,600
I said hold it in, honey.

294
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:24,393
Hold it in.

295
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,017
There's a gas station right there.

296
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,832

Got a wrench?

306

Fill it up with gas, please.

307
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:44,642
Get Mama a wrench.

Air, air, air in the tires, air.

312

the gasoline, mister.

313

We need some water, water and the air...

00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,558
Give Mama room!

I'm gonna catch 'em.

331

She asked me for a wrench.

332
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,142
They dimmed my lights
for a lousy 15 bucks.

333
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,183
That's terrible.

334
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:41,018
How many were there?

335
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,808
There was three of 'em.

336
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,642
The call one grandma.

337
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,476
I'll kill 'em.

339
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:48,142
Ah, thanks son.

340
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:48,976
I'll kill 'em.

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,308
You're welcome, mister.

342
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,808
Hey hey, hey, what, what.

343
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:52,642

348
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:56,933
I have to get going.

349
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:57,767
I need a few hours.

350
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,601
I'm not really like the those people.

351
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,425

486
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:18,267
Not my mother (mumbles)

495
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:33,518
Reach for what?

496
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,808
And don't point that damn thing at me.

497
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,058
Reach for ya' pants,

He's no rapist, Mama.

501
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,350
Well, he can put his
pants on in the presence

young California gentleman.

503
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,058
Hi, Mrs. Stokes.

504
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,308
Good evening, Shawn.

505
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,183
Nice to see you.

506
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:52,184
Is that your mother?

507
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,874
That's my mama.

508

514
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,101
Mama, who said anything about killin'?

515
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,416
But I'm gonna kill him.

516
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:19,892
Now you decided, Melba,

517
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,392
that we was to bust loose.

518
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,267
Are we goin' all the way or ain't we?

519
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,850
Sure we are, Mama.

520
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:27,058
But we'll deal with Clarence
Mudde when we get to him.

521
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,142
Right now, we need money.

522
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,832
But I don't see why we need him.

523
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,225
Fairy, you don't even know
how to comb your own hair.

524
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,308
Put up or shut up you homo greaser.

525
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:36,600
It's him or me, Cheryl!

526
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:37,434
Huh?

527
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,183
Well it's you, Shawn.

528
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,433
But I like Snake, too.

529
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:42,268
Huh?

530
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,600
I'd hit you but I might
slip on your grease.

531
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,142

Melba needs her money.

538
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,517
We gotta figure a way to help her get it.

539
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,475
Am I right or wrong?

540
00:21:58,499 --> 00:21:59,393
Yeah, you're right.

541
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,725
Okay. You got any ideas?

542
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:03,058
Okay, hold it everybody.

543
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:04,642
One at a time.

544
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,725
This is a business meetin'.

545
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:07,225
We're gonna do it right.

546
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:09,767
Okay, ladies first, Mama.

547
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:10,933
Okay, rob a bank.

548
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:12,517
What we foolin' around fer.

549
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,725
I got a sure fire way to beat the house.

550

551
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,642
Blow the safe in one of the big hotels.

552
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,017
We'd get thousands of
dollars in jewelry alone.

553
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,308
That's a rotten idea.

554
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:24,933
How 'bout startin' one
of those chain letters?

555
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:28,017
That's really for the birds, man.

556
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:28,850
Hey, listen.

557
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:29,768
That's penny ante stuff.

558
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:30,850
I'm gonna tell ya' right now,

559
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:32,933
you're not gonna beat the system.

560
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:35,683
You can if you take 'em by surprise.

561
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,267
Hit when they don't expect it.

562
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,308
That's how the keep gettin' us.

563
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:42,683
Well sure, honey, but
buying and supplying a farm

564
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:44,892
takes a might big parcel of money.

565
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,892
How about one of those
24 hour wedding chapels?

566
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,892
Cheryl and Shawn could get married

567
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,541
while we cut the thatch.

568
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,808
I don't wanna get married.

569
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:54,975
Thank you very much.

570
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:55,809
Yeah.

571
00:22:55,833 --> 00:23:00,791
Melba honey, I'd be mighty
proud to make you my wife.

572
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:11,749
Mama?

573
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:15,707
I've always wanted a white wedding.

574
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:17,957
Oh lady baby.

575
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:21,100
That would just suit me fine.

576
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:22,975
(laughs)

577
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,808
Oh definitely, yes, reverend.

578
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,541
We want love, honor and obey.

579
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,707
Don't we, lover?

580
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,433
Yes, honey.

581
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:32,457
We want it all.

582
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,433
And don't forget until death do us part.

583
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,916
It's really important.

584
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:40,832
Very fine.

585
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:42,999
A little music.

586
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,308
(record needle scrapes)

587
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:48,600
(Organ music)

588
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:50,332
Now, we'll proceed.

589
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:52,916
Dearly beloved,

590
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:57,642
we are gathered here in the sight of God.

591
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,142
You better believe it.

592
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,541
Amen.

593
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:08,558
To join together in holy matrimony,

594
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,791
this man and this woman.

595
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:15,142
(door quietly shuts)

596
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:20,124
Do you, Lana Monroe, take this man,

597
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:23,457
Homer Alamo, to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

598
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,541
(gasps) I do.

599
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:35,332
(shuffling)

600
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,892
And do you, Homer Alamo,

601
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,683
take this woman, Lana Monroe,

602
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:42,600
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

603
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,850
I do.

604
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:47,850
(metal clanging)

605
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:51,166
(organ music continues)

606
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,142
And now, may the grace
of God be in your hearts.

607
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,666
And may your souls by Him be possessed.

608
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:15,791
Bestow upon you the riches
that God has to offer.

609
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,725
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

610
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:33,207
(organ music intensifies)

611
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:45,517
Duly appointed by the state of
Nevada, Justice of the Peace.

612
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:48,874
(soft 50's guitar music)

613
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,267
Hold it right there, folks.

614
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,892
Congratulations, I'm sure
you'd love a 8x10 glossy

615
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:01,916
of this momentous...

616
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:05,454
Just give me your name and
address and I'll send you,

617
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:07,433
five dollars alright?

618
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:09,683
Sure you'd love it, don't you want.

619
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:12,350
Oh, I've got a client list a mile long.

620
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:15,058
They all consider me a great artist.

621
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:16,850
Come on, folks, give me a break.

622
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:18,433
(motorcycle engine revs)

623
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:20,475
A full refund if you're not satisfied.

624
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:21,308
(laughing)

625
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:22,143
All I wanna see is my marriage license.

626
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,933
Well, what do you want?

627
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:26,558
Whoo, we're on our way.

628
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:29,058
Got some rice in my purse.

629
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,475
Homer Alamo.

630
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:31,808
I'll get it.

631
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:32,643
(laughs)

632
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,600
Where'd you ever pick
a dumb name like that?

633
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,559
You didn't give me any time to think.

634
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,892
You know, our weddin' was
just to pull a job, Jimmy Bob.

635
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,767
It's the only time I
ever got married at all

636
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,058
and I know it's peculiar,

637
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:44,142
but I feel all warm
inside, like crying, sir.

638
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,018
I get it, Melba.

639
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,892
I feel just as free as you.

640
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:47,916
Just as free.

641
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,642
Yup, we're gonna put together a real stash

642
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,183
and then we're gonna
buy back your 60 acres

643
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:57,017
and I'm gonna forget I ever
had that wife, Ellie Mae.

644
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:57,892
Tell me something.

645
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:58,726
I really gotta know.

646
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,892
Is she pretty?

647
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,058
When I was 17, she
wasn't downright ugly.

648
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:03,725
And she was the richest gal in town.

649
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,517
But is she pretty?

650
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,850
She's depressing and the
boys are depressing, too.

651
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:10,600
I love you, Jim Bob, I swear I do.

652
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:11,559
Mmh hmm.

653
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,558
That wedding chapel register,

654
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:16,058
that money's just hummingbird doo doo.

655
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:17,892
Hardly paid for the wedding.

656
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:22,725
Well if I'm gonna do spring
farmin' in Arkansas, Bertha,

657
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:25,183
cuz' my baby, Melba,

658
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:27,017
she's a might flighty.

659
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,624
Oh, is she?

660
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:31,624
But I love her.

661
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:34,475
Course you do.

662
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:37,457
(surf guitar music)

663
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,642
I still cannot believe
what we just did back there.

664
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,666
Crazy.

665
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,100
Look at the sky.

666
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:56,916
Imagine what the beach is like today.

667
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,457
Cheryl, I don't wanna be an outlaw.

668
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,558
Look at this damn rice.

669
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,267
And why are we goin' to Arkansas?

670
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,475
My mom must be crazy wondering where I am.

671
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,975
Well, at least your mama
has a roof over her head.

672
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,767
Mine doesn't and she
wants to go to Arkansas

673
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,791
and she needs me.

674
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:16,975
So, you can go on back if you want to.

675
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,207
I'm stickin' with my mama.

676
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,850
Cheryl.

677
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:21,642
What?

678
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,666
Oh come on.

679
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:25,791
Come on, you know I'm
gonna stick with you.

680
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,559
You sure?

681
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,683
Yes.

682
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,541
(surf guitar music continues)

683
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:38,041
(engines revving)

684
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:56,249
(register chiming)

685
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:03,100
The prices they charge us for fruit.

686
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,850
You'd think they plucked
it from the Garden of Eden.

687
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:06,314
Look at this one, that's a beauty.

688
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,017
Yeah, right.

689
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:08,850
(giggles)

690
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:09,725
Pardon me, ladies.

691
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,643
Oh, I love apples.

692
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,308
Here we go.

693
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:13,600
She's a beaut.

694
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,142
It's so juicy.

695
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:15,975
Get some bananas, honey.

696
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:16,809
Don't take that, Cheryl.

697
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,475
Put that back.

698
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:21,683
Oh, oh. Oh my heart.

699
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:22,642
Mama.

700
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,475
Oh my heart.

701
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:24,351
Oh sweet Jesus!

702
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,392
(boxes thudding)

703
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,267
(whining)

704
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,059
Oh it's nuts.

705
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,683
The man's pushin' into my chest.

706
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:31,999
Oh hurry, get the manager!

707
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:36,457
Get the manager!

708
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,707
(screaming)

709
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,892
Get out, get out!

710
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:43,851
This is no PT Barnum shame.

711
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:44,916
Break for Jesus.

712
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:47,851
Find a couch

713
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,725
and give her her medicine.

714
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:51,100
Get away, people, get out.

715
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,374
Oh, my heart.

716
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:56,707
Just take me in your arms, sweet Jesus.

717
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:00,725
Oh oh, let me sit down here.

718
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:01,749
Oh my God.

719
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:05,308
(gasping)

720
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:06,600
I'll call the doctor.

721
00:30:06,624 --> 00:30:08,207
No, just open the safe.

722
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:10,933
We need that money a lot more than you do.

723
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:12,683
It's only $40.00 in there.

724
00:30:12,707 --> 00:30:14,267
Then get it, right now.

725
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,683
Move, hurry up.

726
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:17,100
Come on, come on.

727
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:18,642
Business has been lousy.

728
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,267
Get that safe open.

729
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,433
You're standin' in front of it.

730
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:23,975
Give it, give it.

731
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,082
Do it, do it.

732
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:28,350
Do it, do it, get it.

733
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:29,808

Hey, drive my Harley in here

926
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:20,933
and I'll kick up the dust

927
00:40:20,957 --> 00:40:23,100
and I'll just make a u-turn
and we could knock over...

928
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:25,017
Bad idea, Snake, bad idea.

929
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,392
No, I don't reckon I've been
taking care of you ladies

930
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,725
like you deserve.

931
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:31,683
Yeah, you have, honey.

932
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:34,058
Well, I've been giving
it a real think, now.

933
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:35,892
What you been thinkin', Jim Bob?

934
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,499
Why don't we just kidnap me?

00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:40,892

937
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:41,726
How do.

938
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,267
Looky here, boy.

939
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:46,808
Mayor Jim Bob Trotter, Steamhead Texas.

940
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,582
Also happen to be the
sheriff of Gozula county.

941
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,850
I like this fair state of New Mexico.

942
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:52,768
I want you people to know that.

943
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:55,142
I'd like to spend some time here.

944
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,225
Peaceful and quiet, no phone calls.

945
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,267
No crazy phone calls of any kind.

946
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,268
I'd like to rest my nerves.

947
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,058
Now you got that or don't you got that?

948
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,517
Yeah, I got that.

949
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,351
(tires squealing)

950
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,142
I want you to rip that phone
out of my room, you hear?

951
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,767
And if my wife calls, I want you...

952
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,933
(got shots and breaking glass)

953
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:10,767

954
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:11,642
Hey what's going...

955
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:12,476
What the mother?

956
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,975
Now come on, come on!

957
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,642

00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,142

I dug you first, didn't I, Shawn?

1103
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,933
You dug me first?

1104
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:13,957
Yeah.

1105
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:17,268
I want,

1106
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,457
I just wanna know how
you feel about Snake.

1107
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:21,916
Aw, Shawn, come on.

1108
00:47:23,124 --> 00:47:25,707
Now my daughter, Jim boy,

1109
00:47:27,082 --> 00:47:30,933
could have been married
about six times before this.

1110
00:47:30,957 --> 00:47:34,707
The men became big executives.

1111
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:38,933
Yeah, you should have
seen her as a little girl.

1112
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:43,874
Always so in love with
nature and life in general.

1113
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,767
Once Daniel got shot,

1114
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:47,916
we traveled west.

1115
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,225
She just worked at
everything she could find

1116
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:52,416
to help pay the rent.

1117
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:57,017
Beg, borrowed, but never stole.

1118
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,725
She never stole to get
the down payment on that.

1119
00:47:59,749 --> 00:48:02,350
God damn beauty parlor.

1120
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:03,916
You love me, don't you, Shawn?

1121
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,183
I mean you wouldn't leave me, would ya'?

1122
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:09,207
No.

1123
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:12,475
God.

1124
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:14,957
Cheryl, you don't even
know what's going on.

1125
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,332
Why don't you kiss me.

1126
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:22,582
Well,

1127
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:26,249
let's do something that'll
make us both feel real good.

1128
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:37,517
[Sheba] She almost died
giving birth to Cheryl.

1129
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:38,476
Told the doctor,

1130
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,666
if it comes down to me or the baby,

1131
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:43,624
you save that child.

1150
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:44,392

1155
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:57,308
I ain't been so free since I broke out

1156
00:49:57,332 --> 00:49:59,642
of the old folks home.

1157
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,475
That step son of mine, the bastard,

1158
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,558
he was the last kin I had left.

1159
00:50:04,582 --> 00:50:07,517
He decided to put me away.

1160
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,517
That was seven years ago today.

1161
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:12,225
My 75th birthday.

1162
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:14,850
Oh, it's your birthday?

1163
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:16,600
Oh, it's her birthday.

Happy birthday!

Oh, happy birthday, it's her birthday.

1166
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:24,433
It's the first time for 17 years,

1167
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:26,933
I haven't been alone for my birthday.

1168
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,683
I feel like I have my family again.

1169
00:50:29,707 --> 00:50:32,392
You do, we're your family.

1170
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:33,933
[Snake] You better believe that, Bertha.

1171
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:35,267
Bertha, by your next birthday,

1172
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,558
you're gonna be in the nut
house with the rest of us.

1173
00:50:37,582 --> 00:50:39,225
Bertha?

1174
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,850
She'll be in a home for unwed mothers.

1175
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:43,541
Young fellar, are you...

1176
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,558

You propositioning me?

1178

[Snake] Well...

1179
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,683
Cuz' if you are, there's
only one way to find out.

1180
00:50:52,707 --> 00:50:55,892
And you better grow up
a little cuz' I like 'em

1181
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:56,957

(giggling)

1183
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,541
Oh, Jim Bob.

00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,392
Make me feel so good.

1185
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:08,642
Mmh hmm.

1186
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:13,582
Make me feel like Ava,
Lana, like Rita Hayworth.

1187
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:17,850
Like Elizabeth and Eddie.

1188
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:18,874
Oh, baby.

1189
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:21,600
Don't forget the Alamo, alright.

1190
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:25,183
You're lover, God damn the tummy bump.

1191
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,267
Not scared of the tummy bump.

1192
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:31,308
Yeah, no need to be scared, honey.

1193
00:51:31,332 --> 00:51:33,457
Cuz' you're the lady baby.

1194
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:37,975
Did you ever smoke a cigar?

1195
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:39,058
What?

1196
00:51:39,082 --> 00:51:41,267
Well, I think I'm gonna
start smokin' a cigar,

1197
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,541
you know, change my image.

1198
00:51:43,832 --> 00:51:44,975
What's so good about being an outlaw

1199
00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:46,767
if you look like an in-law.

1200
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,683
Come on, let's go here.

1201
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:50,017
This better be good.

1202
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,933
My hair better not fall out

1203
00:51:51,957 --> 00:51:54,183
or you're gonna be minus some teeth.

1204
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:55,558
Who's got teeth?

1205
00:51:55,582 --> 00:51:57,350
Meanwhile here in Steamhead, Texas.

1206
00:51:57,374 --> 00:52:00,767
The wife and kids of
mayor, big Jim Trotter...

1207
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:05,058
Oh sometimes, I think you
don't even understand America.

1208
00:52:05,082 --> 00:52:06,933
Oh, hell.

1209
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,933
America's God's country.

1210
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:11,124
If you do good, you get good.

1211
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:13,892
Hey!

1212
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:16,142
My husband's a peace officer.

1213
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,475
He is sheriff of this here Gazula county.

1214
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:21,392
Ah yes, Mrs. Trotter.

1215
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:22,226
I would just like to ask you

1216
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,850

1217
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:26,767

1219
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:32,642

Say, well, tell me.

1222
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,892
Are you actually planning
to pay the ransom?

1223
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:44,666
Well, uh, I just don't see
how I have any other choice.

1224
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:46,808
Do you?

1225
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:49,850
Well, how could Jim
Boy ever been married

1226
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:52,850
to that dried up piece of baggage?

1227
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:55,225
Well, that baggage was full of gold

1228
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:57,142
and he was young and inexperienced

1229
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,225
and had a hard on for Ft. Knox.

1230
00:52:59,249 --> 00:53:01,374
Bertha, you're a pistol.

1231
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:05,666
(singing softly)

1232
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:12,350
(door slides)

1233
00:53:12,374 --> 00:53:13,892
Snake!

1234
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:14,916
Yowza!

1235
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:18,808

since you gathered me up
in your big strong arms.

1239
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,850
Thunder and lightening.

1240
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:30,166
You know, you're one hell of a gal.

1241
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:33,725
(groaning)

1242
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:34,933
Don't get it in my eye.

1243
00:53:34,957 --> 00:53:36,600
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim Bob.

1244
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:37,475
I'm not very good.

1245
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:38,309

- Okay.

1246
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,142

(laughs)

1248
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:44,225
God, you're both babies.

1249
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:45,101
Don't you know when a woman likes

1250
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:46,933
to have privacy in the bathroom?

1251
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,183
Well, speaking of babies.

1252
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:49,725
We're naming it Stokes.

1253
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:50,601
Stokes?

1254
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,683
- Stokes.
- Stokes.

1255
00:53:51,707 --> 00:53:53,850
I cannot believe what's happening here.

1256
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:55,017
Look at this

1257
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,225
and the really weird
thing is I'm not even mad.

1258
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:58,059
I'm not mad at Snake.

1259
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,683
I'm not mad at Cheryl.

1260
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:00,707
Why aren't I mad?

1261
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:05,892

1263
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:11,225
there's a missile aimed
right at this teepee

1264
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:14,933
and any moment, it could go off.

1265
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:15,957
Boom!

1266
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:18,582
So don't sweat the small stuff.

1267
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:20,957

Yell 'em into heaven.

1459
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:39,100
[All Together] Yay, Jim Bob!

1460
01:05:39,124 --> 01:05:40,124
Yay, Bertha!

1461
01:05:49,832 --> 01:05:52,933
[All Singing] Told
me that he would buy me

1462
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:55,957
a rubber dolly if I be good.

1463
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:59,142
Now don't you tell her

1464
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:01,183
I get a fellar,

1465
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,975
Look, children, look, look,

1466
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:07,558
this here is the land.

1467
01:06:07,582 --> 01:06:08,393
[Melba] That's right.

1468
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:12,517
And the good Lord, Jesus,
rose from land like this.

1469
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:13,351
Amen.

1470
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,475
And the most important fact is,

1471
01:06:16,499 --> 01:06:17,892
it's pretty.

1472
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:20,017
Mamma, you can cry now if you want to.

1473
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,642
It's been 30 years.

1474
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,600
And I'm gonna cry.

1475
01:06:23,624 --> 01:06:25,642
And if you wanna, you can laugh,

1476
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:27,999
cuz' that's alright, too.

1477
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:33,392
(soft 50's guitar music)

1478
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:35,517
(dog barking)

1479
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:37,350
Just a minute.

1480
01:06:37,374 --> 01:06:42,332
You try to tell me that this
here is Jerusalem, Arkansas?

1481
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:43,851
[Melba] It is, Mama.

1482
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,308
Maw, what do you think
we've been driving for...

1483
01:06:46,332 --> 01:06:47,916
Oh bull crap!

1484
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:52,642
What kind of a dumb hick you take me for.

1485
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:55,207
Ain't any of you can drive or read a map.

1486
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:59,392
We're, we're back in Long Beach.

1487
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,892
Well, maybe the town's changed.

1488
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:05,975
[Sheba] No, why would anybody
wanna do a thing like that.

1489
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:07,850
Change Jerusalem.

1490
01:07:07,874 --> 01:07:09,832
It was a nice town.

1491
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:13,683
Our little house is sittin'
there waitin' for us, Mama.

1492
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:15,975
Our hill out in back.

1493
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:17,624
My apple tree must be huge by now.

1494
01:07:18,874 --> 01:07:22,225
Don't you try to cheer me up now, Melba.

1495
01:07:22,249 --> 01:07:24,558
I lost everything a girl ever had

1496
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,999
or ever wanted to have.

1497
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:31,124
Oh, poor Jim Bob's back
there somewhere dead.

1498
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:33,933
Well now, alright.

1499
01:07:33,957 --> 01:07:35,558
Alright now, children.

1500
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:39,517
We're going straight out to the cemetery

1501
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:41,541
and then on to the farm.

1502
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:51,249
(engine idles)

1503
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:05,874
I know he's out here somewhere.

1504
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:10,166
But who the hell are the rest
of these sons of bitches.

1505
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:12,018
They're dead, Mama.

1506
01:08:12,042 --> 01:08:14,624
They're just packin' 'em in
like there's no tomorrow.

1507
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:19,350
Why this here field
was just covered with,

1508
01:08:19,374 --> 01:08:24,308
just covered with
daisies and corn flowers.

1509
01:08:24,332 --> 01:08:26,100
Here, take a deep drink, Mama.

1510
01:08:26,124 --> 01:08:28,642
Bring that other bottle, Snake.

1511
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,541
We're going hikin' up into heaven.

1512
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,058
[Shawn] I'd give my right
arm for a Long Beach pizza.

1513
01:08:35,082 --> 01:08:36,082
For a real taco.

1514
01:08:37,707 --> 01:08:40,517
I hope Mama Sheba can get the farm.

1515
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:43,475
But we are hunted, wanted criminals.

1516
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:45,433
[Snake] Yeah, we're all
gonna end up in jail, too.

1517
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:46,808
[Cheryl] We ain't goin' to jail.

1518
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:47,832
Nobody's going to jail.

1519
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:55,582
Where the grapes of wrath is stored.

1520
01:08:56,624 --> 01:09:00,017
He hath loosed the fateful lightning

1521
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:05,041
of his terrible swift sword.

1522
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:08,041
His truth is marchin" on.

1523
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:17,058
(jaw harp music)

1524
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:18,082
Can't be.

1525
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:22,267
They can't bury that dirty cock roach

1526
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:26,291
in the same sacred soil
you're daddy's buried in.

1527
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:30,541
He was so full of crap,
his eyes was brown.

1528
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:33,999
(scraping)

1529
01:09:35,707 --> 01:09:36,707
Daniel.

1530
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:46,124
I'm home, Daniel.

1531
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:49,707
I come back to the Stokes land

1532
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:55,582
and I've brung the family.

1533
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:00,999
Now, this here is Shawn

1534
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:03,916
and our baby, Cheryl.

1535
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:08,267
And old Snake, there.

1536
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:11,207
And here's your baby, Melba.

1537
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:17,933
Well say something to your daddy, Melba.

1538
01:10:17,957 --> 01:10:21,392
♪ Buy me a new dolly if I be good ♪

1539
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,124
(softly humming)

1540
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:37,249
(birds chirping)

1541
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,892
(clicking)

1542
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:05,166
(gun fires)

1543
01:11:12,374 --> 01:11:14,749
(shattering)

1544
01:11:23,957 --> 01:11:25,374
On Stokes land, Mama.

1545
01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:31,017
And we're drunk as a pair of queens.

1546
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,767
Here you finish this, honey.

1547
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,767
Oh, you always give me
the best white lightenin'

1548
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,517
whenever I had the...

1549
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,434
And you never,

1550
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:40,933
you never missed one day of school.

1551
01:11:40,957 --> 01:11:42,666
You was an honor student.

1552
01:11:43,791 --> 01:11:45,933
Then my bossoms started showin'.

1553
01:11:45,957 --> 01:11:46,809
(laughing)

1554
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:48,517
Happy and blessed.

1555
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:52,957
Oh, I know if love is free on this land.

1556
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:59,082
Mama, they added on to our little house.

1557
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,892
They put a new roof on it.

1558
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,808
Mama, wait.

1559
01:12:03,832 --> 01:12:05,582
Cheryl, Cheryl!

1560
01:12:10,749 --> 01:12:13,600
The most important thing
in the world is mercy,

1561
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:15,267
'cept for one other thing.

1562
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:16,933
That's stayin' alive.

1563
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,017
You gotta look out for yourself

1564
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,350
and for that little Stokes
growin' inside of you.

1565
01:12:21,374 --> 01:12:22,808
Is that from the good book, Mama?

1566
01:12:22,832 --> 01:12:24,142
That's from my book.

1567
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:26,207
You stay right here, don't you kids move.

1568
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:28,457
You stay right there.

1569
01:12:29,457 --> 01:12:31,791
(footsteps)

1570
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:43,707
(somber 50's guitar music)

1571
01:12:57,374 --> 01:13:01,308
My, they sure keep this grass up nice.

1572
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:02,975
It's like velvet, Mama.

1573
01:13:02,999 --> 01:13:05,267
Must keep a lot of cows.

1574
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:08,308
Well, you better watch
out for them cow pies.

1575
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:10,392
Sure keep it up nice.

1576
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:13,058
You don't have to worry about no cow pies.

1577
01:13:13,082 --> 01:13:14,874
Now what the hell is this?

1578
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:18,124
Oh.

1579
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,475
Mudde weddin'?

1580
01:13:21,499 --> 01:13:23,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

1581
01:13:23,124 --> 01:13:27,350
I give you Mr. and Mrs.
Clarence Mudde, Jr.

1582
01:13:27,374 --> 01:13:29,999
I only wish you poor father
was here to see this day.

1583
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:34,392
(crowd chattering)

1584
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:37,392
- Mr. Clarence Mudde.
- Oh.

1585
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:39,666
Junior, the law is the law.

1586
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,975
God bless you, Melba.

1587
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,100
Hee hee.

1588
01:13:46,124 --> 01:13:48,850
He bares a liken to his daddy.

1589
01:13:48,874 --> 01:13:50,392
Don't he just.

1590
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:51,725
Mama.

1591
01:13:51,749 --> 01:13:53,707
(gasps)

1592
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:57,600
(phone dial scraping)

1593
01:13:57,624 --> 01:13:59,600
Now look here, Mr. Mudde.

1594
01:13:59,624 --> 01:14:02,683
I don't care about no bank note.

1595
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,999
You are officially evicted

1596
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:09,767
from this here land, Stokes land.

1597
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,183
This is outrageous!

1598
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:12,017
What is the meaning of this?

1599
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:12,809
If you don't like it,

1600
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,975
you can just get out of our party!

1601
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:16,017
Go on, get out!

1602
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,725
No wait, wait a minute!

1603
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:20,558
(glass shattering)

1604
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:21,850
(screaming)

1605
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,166
(gun fires)

1606
01:14:25,499 --> 01:14:26,499
Not yet!

1607
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:30,767
(jaw harp music)

1608
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:34,017
(brakes skidding)

1609
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:36,832
(tires squealing)

1610
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:40,726
We have to kill those cops.

1611
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,683
Cheryl, you gotta say it.

1612
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:44,683
You gotta tell us, it's your blood.

1613
01:14:44,707 --> 01:14:47,142
It's me, it's my blood.

1614
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,892
Mama told me what to do.

1615
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:49,916
She told me.

1616
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,124
Come on, come on!

1617
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:55,558
Now you know the law

1618
01:14:55,582 --> 01:14:56,850
and I know the law.

1619
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:58,058
And if you don't,

1620
01:14:58,082 --> 01:15:02,433
you're gonna get this
right between your eyes.

1621
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:04,183
Don't those guns, ladies!

1622
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:06,541
(gun fires)

1623
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:11,600
(glass shatters)

1624
01:15:11,624 --> 01:15:13,308
(screaming)

1625
01:15:13,332 --> 01:15:14,808
You just don't understand!

1626
01:15:14,832 --> 01:15:16,267
Mama!

1627
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:19,808
I'm the land lady of
this particular land!

1628
01:15:19,832 --> 01:15:20,642
(gun shots)

1629
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:21,666
Mama!

1630
01:15:24,999 --> 01:15:25,999
Mama!

1631
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:28,541
Mama!

1632
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:30,332
Mama!

1633
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:32,767
(gun shots)

1634
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:33,601
Mama!

1635
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:34,808
(screaming)

1636
01:15:34,832 --> 01:15:35,832
