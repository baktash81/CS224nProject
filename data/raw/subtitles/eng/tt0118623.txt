1
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,967
Always in my dream,

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,648
I'm clinging to a branch,

3
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,690
knowing full well that
death inevitably awaits me.

4
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:23,113
The fear of dying without ever having
known love was greater than the fear

5
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:27,989
of death itself I know now I was not alone
in the horror of this darkness.

6
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:32,121
So, too, was the fear
of Anna Karenina.

7
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,808
It was then that a drop of honey
sweet enough to divert my eyes

8
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,989
from the cruel truth
came into my llfe.

9
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:12,230
She was the princess

10
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:15,075
EKaterina Scherbatsky.

11
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,672
Thank you, Constantine Dmitrich.

12
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,728
I didn't know that
you were in Moscow.

13
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:26,582
I arrived yesterday.

14
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:27,916
I mean, today.

15
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,574
I was going
to come to see you.

16
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,288
I didn't know
you could skate so well.

17
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,268
I'm awful.

18
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:37,035
But the rumor is that

19
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:38,957
you are a superlative skater.

20
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:42,932
Oh, years ago. lt used to be
my passion.

21
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,199
Skate with me.

22
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,296
Must be dull in the country
in the winter.

23
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,218
Not at all. I'm very busy.

24
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,142
Mama said that you live
like a barbarian out there

25
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,978
and wear peasant clothes.

26
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,207
There's a lot more to it
than you think.

27
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:04,360
It's very scientific.

28
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:06,688
Are you here for long?

29
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,084
I don't know.
That depends on you.

30
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:18,255
Mama's waiting for me.

31
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:24,029
-May I call on you?
-We're at home on Thursday as usual.

32
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,002
Today, then.

33
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:26,910
Au revoir!

34
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,921
You said you wanted my advice
on a delicate matter?

35
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:34,766
Yes, Stiva.

36
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,413
I think I'm in love...

37
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,525
but I'm plain and too old.

38
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,758
She may be able to love me as a friend,
but I would've to be handsome

39
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:51,409
and more remarkable to make
her love me as a husband.

40
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,742
Who is the lucky girl?

41
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:53,896
Can't you guess?

42
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:55,809
I'd be your brother-in-law.

43
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,113
Kitty.

44
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,522
Do you think there's
any possibility?

45
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:00,625
Oh, why shouldn't
there be?

46
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,550
For God's sake, be absolutely
frank with me.

47
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,077
I'll tell you something.

48
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:08,295
My wife Dolly is a most
wonderful woman.

49
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:12,082
-She can see through people.
-What do you mean?

50
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,842
Well, I mean, not only that
she likes you,

51
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,768
but she says Kitty is certain
to be your wife.

52
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,566
They are sisters,
after all.

53
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,611
She... she said that?

54
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,530
Constantine Dmitrich Levin.

55
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:29,631
Oh, God.

56
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,356
He's come early.

57
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,052
I don't think I've come
at the right time.

58
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,185
-I'm too early.
-Oh, no.

59
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,488
This is what I wanted...

60
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,436
to find you alone.

61
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,206
The guests should be
here in a moment.

62
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:54,392
I told you that I didn't know
whether I would be here long...

63
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,260
that it depended on you.

64
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,763
I meant...

65
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,066
I meant do say...

66
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,650
be my wife.

67
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,416
I cannot be.

68
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,428
Forgive me.

69
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:28,820
It was not meant to be.

70
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:35,890
Why, Constantine Dmitrich.

71
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:38,314
Do stay. Have some tea.

72
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,180
Ah, Constantine Dmitrich.

73
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,122
Back in our corrupt Babylon.

74
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,406
Well, is Babylon reformed,
or have you been corrupted?

75
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,892
That you remembered my words so well.
They must have made an impression on you.

76
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,829
Of course. I note down
everything you say.

77
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:58,712
What's the matter with Levin today?Why
doesn't he launch into one of his tirades?

78
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,593
Please.

79
00:06:01,304 --> 00:06:02,680
Constantine Dmitrich.

80
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:06,262
How's it that at home in our village of
Kaluga, the peasants have spent their all

81
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,368
on drink and now pay us nothing?

82
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,750
What is the meaning of that?

83
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:13,810
You're always so full of praise
for peasants.

84
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,643
Do let me introduce you.

85
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,720
Constantine Dmitrich Levin,

86
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,442
Count Alexei Kirillovich
Vronsky.

87
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:26,438
Constantine Dmitrich despises
and hates town and us townspeople.

88
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:29,299
Do you live in the country
all year round?

89
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:32,144
I should think it must be
rather dull in winter.

90
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:34,412
Not at all if one has work
to do. Besides, you can't...

91
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:37,886
-be dull in your own company.
-l like the country.

92
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:39,118
I'd be bored to tears.

93
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:42,731
One simply can't live without
sophisticated conversation.

94
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,330
Countess Nordston was telling me

95
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,659
about a demonstration of table
rapping and spiritualism she attended.

96
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:50,330
Oh, that would be fascinating.

97
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:52,128
I've never seen anything
supernatural.

98
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:55,118
Do you believe in spirits,
Constantine Dmitrich?

99
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,506
Why'd you ask me that? You know
perfectly well what my answer will be.

100
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,806
But I want to hear you opinion.

101
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,140
My opinion's that table rapping
merely proves

102
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,799
that the so-called educated classes
are no better than the peasants.

103
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,855
They, too, believe in the evil eyes
and spirits.

104
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,335
But I've witnessed it myself.

105
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:11,391
But don't you think
there's something in it?

106
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,522
If we admit to the existence
of electricity

107
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,476
of which we know nothing,

108
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:21,354
Why shouldn't there exist
some new forces yet unknown to us?

109
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,919
Because with electricity when
you rub wool and resin together,

110
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:27,049
you invariably produce a
recognizable phenomenon.

111
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,666
But with this hocus-pocus...

112
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:32,605
Suppose we try now.

113
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,678
Do let us try,
Princess Kitty.

114
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:56,820
Ah, Stiva.

115
00:07:58,346 --> 00:07:59,306
Who are you meeting?

116
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,467
My mother.

117
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,081
-You were missed last night.
-Where?

118
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:06,343
The Chateau des Fleurs,
of course.

119
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:10,934
My God, there was this wonderful
little girl doing the cancan.

120
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:14,822
I went home. I felt in such an agreeable
frame of mind when I left the Scherbatskys',

121
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,535
I didn't want to go
anywhere else.

122
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:20,548
"By the mark of your steed, I can
tell your fine breed

123
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,544
and a young man
in love by his eyes."

124
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:27,202
-And who are you meeting?
-I've come to meet a pretty woman.

125
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,018
-Oh, indeed.
-Shame on you.

126
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:30,863
My sister Anna.

127
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,039
Karenin's wife?

128
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:34,765
Yes, well, you must know her.

129
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,585
I don't think so. I know Karenin
by sight and by repute.

130
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,538
You've a very illustrious brother-in-law.
Very high up in the Ministry.

131
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,337
Yes, a remarkable man.

132
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:45,740
But not our kind.

133
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,474
Like your friend Levin. I met him last
night, an insufferable fellow.

134
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:51,433
Oh, you don't appreciate my Levin.

135
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:54,130
But yesterday there was a reason
for him being out of sorts.

136
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:55,864
You don't mean he, uh...

137
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,809
Levin has been in love with
Kitty for so long,

138
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:02,046
and I feel so very sorry
for him.

139
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,483
So that's it.

140
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:27,661
Excuse me.

141
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:41,129
You got my telegram?

142
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,517
How are you?Well?

143
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:45,943
-Have a good journey, mama?
-Anna Arkadyevna!

144
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,142
Can't youfind your brother?

145
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,124
Stiva, here!

146
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,444
She's very charming, isn't she?

147
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:55,699
Poor girl. Her husband refuses
to travel with her. He says he's too busy.

148
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,530
Well, Countess, you've met
your son, I've met my brother.

149
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,662
Pardon me for not recognizing you,
but I don't think we've ever met before.

150
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,145
Anna Arkadyevna

151
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,299
has a little boy of 8, Seriozha.

152
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,224
They've never been
parted before, and she's fretting

153
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,765
at having left him behind. Really,
Anna, you can't expect never to leave him.

154
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,604
Well, good-bye, countess.

155
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,955
Good-bye, my dear.

156
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,198
Very charming.

157
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:34,744
Horrible.

158
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:45,492
He's dead.

159
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,929
It is a bad omen.

160
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,787
Nonsense. You've come.

161
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,671
That is the chief thing.

162
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,975
You cannot imagine how much
I'm counting on you.

163
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:05,794
Stiva, I know you're to blame.
Don't deny it.

164
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,382
9 years... my children...

165
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,645
all to be thrown away
because of a...

166
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:12,633
momentary lapse.

167
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,193
True. lt was not nice

168
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:18,503
that she was the
children's governess.

169
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,305
What can I do?

170
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:24,805
Drop me at your house and
go bacK to the court.

171
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,657
Is this Grisha?

172
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,698
How he's grown!

173
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:30,845
How happy and well
you look.

174
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,147
He told me.

175
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,999
He met me at
the station.

176
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,169
Grisha, go and find Tanya.

177
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,126
of course she's young,

178
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:59,133
and she's pretty.

179
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,133
My youth and looks are gone,

180
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,971
taken by him and
his children.

181
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,371
I hate him.

182
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,796
I don't want to speak up
for him,

183
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,970
but what is the best thing to do
in this dreadful situation, Dolly?

184
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:13,197
Stiva is ashamed.

185
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,459
But he made love to her.

186
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,340
I don't excuse him, but...

187
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,348
that's how it is.

188
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:32,035
Anna's mission to heal the rift
in her brother's family

189
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:35,640
was not unliKe my own desire
to restore the ties with my brother,

190
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:38,879
so desperate were we both
to feel love.

191
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,246
Good evening.

192
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,137
Excuse me. Is Nikolai Levin here?

193
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,163
There is a gentleman here,
Nikolai Dmitrich.

194
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,270
Nikolai.

195
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:01,991
Kostya.

196
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:05,382
What is it?
What do you want?

197
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,649
I don't want anything.

198
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:09,199
I came to see you.

199
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:10,468
You're my brother.

200
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,450
This woman is my life's
companion.

201
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:16,019
Maria Nikolayevna.

202
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,249
I took her out of a brothel.

203
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:26,675
But anyone who wants
to know me must respect her, too.

204
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,507
All right, then, Masha,

205
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:39,007
supper for 3, then.

206
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:41,233
with vodka and wine.

207
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,651
Your brother drinks too much.

208
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,694
Take no notice of her.
She's a whore.

209
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:50,796
You are a gentleman.

210
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,808
Nikolai, don't drink.

211
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,234
Leave me a...
Leave me alone.

212
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,600
I'll beat you.

213
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:03,146
How about supper, then?

214
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:07,902
Have a drink.

215
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:10,569
Tell me how you do it.

216
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,656
Why aren't you married yet?

217
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:16,760
Oh, no luck.

218
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,266
I think there must be something
about me that repels people.

219
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,541
Why?

220
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,234
For me, everything's over.

221
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:28,844
For you...

222
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,431
Come back with me...

223
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:36,945
to the country.

224
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,656
For the sake of your health.

225
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,689
No. Too much to do.
I've become a communist.

226
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:43,988
Nikolai, the police.

227
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:47,307
They'll persecute me like they do
anyone who's not a scoundrel.

228
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,040
Here.

229
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:04,816
You want to fell
magnanimous...

230
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:07,593
feel righteous.

231
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,427
I'll let you have that
satisfaction.

232
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,617
Don' t think too badly
of me, Kostya.

233
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:33,355
Mama, please.

234
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,363
Princess Kitty, may I ask you
for the quadrille?

235
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,020
I'm sorry, but I'm promised
to count Vronsky,

236
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,472
but you may have
the second quadrille.

237
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,992
An honor, princess.

238
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,459
The master of ceremonies
can never be refused.

239
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,538
It was nice of you
to come in good time.

240
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:23,155
Such a bad habit to be late.

241
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,094
-Where may I take you?
-Madame Karenina's over there, I think.

242
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,466
Will you take me to her, please?

243
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:11,163
Pardon, mesdames,
monsieurs, pardon.

244
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,803
You even dance into the room.

245
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:19,066
Princess Kitty's one of my
most faithful helpers.

246
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:22,889
She adorns the ballroom and
makes the ball gay.

247
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:27,740
-May I have the pleasure?
-No. I never dance if I can help it.

248
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,277
Oh, but you must tonight.

249
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,329
Well, but if it's impossible
not to dance, let us dance, then.

250
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:08,098
Well?

251
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,605
Nothing.

252
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,561
Princess, you are such
a delight.

253
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,818
Is your card free
for the mazurka?

254
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:29,093
I should withdraw.

255
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,177
This is turning out
absurdly.

256
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:35,823
Will you stay to supper? I have a
wonderful cotillion in mind.

257
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:38,207
No, I won't stay. I've danced
more at this ball

258
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,826
than I have in a whole winter
in Petersburg.

259
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,487
These few brief moments
intoxicated Anna

260
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,439
liKe a light pouring into
the dark room that was her llfe.

261
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:52,970
We've stopped, mistress.

262
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,649
I want a breath of air.

263
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:26,051
What are you
doing here?

264
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:30,135
You know that I have come
to be where you are.

265
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:31,922
I cannot help myself.

266
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,063
Forgive me if what
I say offends you.

267
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,367
You shouldn't say that.

268
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:50,331
And I beg you, if you're a gentleman,
to forget this as I willforget it.

269
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:52,146
Not one word...

270
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,264
not one gesture of yours...

271
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:56,992
Shall l...

272
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,834
could I ever forget.

273
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,021
Stop it.

274
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:49,978
Yes, as you see, here is
your devoted husband

275
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:51,765
burning with impatience
to see you.

276
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,441
Is Seriozha all right?

277
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:57,491
Is that all the reward
I get for my ardor?

278
00:22:57,706 --> 00:22:59,274
Yes, he's quite all right.

279
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,711
Did you have
a good night?

280
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,691
Excellent. Thank you.

281
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:14,030
Ah, we've met before, I believe.
Count Vronsky.

282
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,296
You set off with the mother and return
with the son. Back from furlough, I presume.

283
00:23:17,434 --> 00:23:19,501
So, my dear, how was Moscow?

284
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,433
I hope I may have the honor
of calling on you.

285
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:24,090
Delighted. We're at home
on Mondays.

286
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:45,472
I told you it was mama!
I knew!

287
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:48,277
Oh, my pet.

288
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:54,236
Gifts from Tanya
and Grisha.

289
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:57,229
Tanya can read now, you know?
She's even teaching Grisha.

290
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,859
Is she nicer than me?

291
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:03,573
To me you're nicer than anyone
else in the world.

292
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,488
I know I am.

293
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:16,206
On the whole, then, your
visit was a success?

294
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:20,170
I cannot see how a man
like that can be exonerated,

295
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:21,829
even if he is your brother.

296
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:26,361
But I'm glad it all ended satisfactorily
and that you're back again.

297
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:29,465
You wouldn't believe how
irksome it is to dine alone.

298
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,257
I missed you, too.

299
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,169
Time for bed.

300
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:06,830
Betsy,

301
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:10,746
-I'm beginning to lose hope.
-Whatever hope could you have?

302
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,013
None.

303
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:17,461
Excuse me. I'm afraid
I've become ridiculous.

304
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:20,298
Oh, my dear, you're in
no danger of that.

305
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:23,233
A man pursuing a young girl
might be ridiculous,

306
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:25,020
but a man in love
with a married woman,

307
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,324
that has something fine
and grand about it.

308
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:31,077
It could never be ridiculous.
Next you'll be telling me

309
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,862
that young girls should be
virtuous, women chaste,

310
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:36,086
men virile, and children should be
brought up

311
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:39,655
to pay their debts and earn their
bread and all the other nonsense.

312
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,771
But look at them...

313
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:42,724
Karenin,

314
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:46,143
that awful Lydia lvanovna.

315
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,335
So old-fashioned,

316
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:50,472
so stuffy.
They surround her.

317
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,056
When I am old and ugly,

318
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,703
I'll become like them.

319
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,813
For a beautiful woman
like Anna, it is too soon

320
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:02,718
for her spirit to be crushed
by such boredom.

321
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:06,248
We must rescue her

322
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:08,906
before it is too late.

323
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,204
Come to my house
on Saturday.

324
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,713
Is it true that the younger Vlassiev
girl is going to marry Topov?

325
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,607
Yes, they say it's
quite settled.

326
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:37,072
I am surprised at her parents.
I heard it was a love match.

327
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:41,041
A love match?What antediluvian
ideas you have.

328
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:42,878
Who talks of love nowadays?

329
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,551
That foolish old custom's
not left us yet.

330
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:47,967
The only happy marriages are
marriages of convenience

331
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:51,700
where both parties have sown
their wild oats.

332
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:54,506
ln my young days, I was
in love with a deacon.

333
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,336
I didn't know that
it did me any good.

334
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:59,166
No, but joking apart.
I believe that

335
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:00,919
before one can know
what love really is,

336
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,321
one must have a fall
and pick oneself up again.

337
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,360
Even after marriage?

338
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:07,920
It's never too late.

339
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,183
I've been wanting to tell you that you
behaved badly, very badly, indeed.

340
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:24,281
You think I don't know
that I behaved badly?

341
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:26,924
But who made me?

342
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:28,764
How can you say that?

343
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,844
You know why.

344
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:33,625
That only shows
you have no heart.

345
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,578
I came here tonight knowing
that I would meet you

346
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:44,316
to make it perfectly clear
this must stop.

347
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,203
You make me feel as if
I was guilty of something.

348
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:48,823
What do you
want me to do?

349
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:50,708
I want you to go
to Moscow and...

350
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,521
You don't want that.

351
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:57,694
Then do this for me.

352
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,459
Never utter
those words again.

353
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,059
And let us
be good friends.

354
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:25,052
Friends
we shall never be.

355
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:26,743
You know that.

356
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:30,663
There is only one way
we can be happy.

357
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,109
I have nothing left
but you. Remember that.

358
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:31,050
Nothing matters anymore...

359
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,723
Not even life...

360
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,626
for one moment
of happiness like this.

361
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,729
Happiness?

362
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:41,178
Don't ever
speak of it again.

363
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,660
I have to warn you.

364
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:21,325
Warn me?
What about?

365
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:25,231
That by thoughtlessness and
indiscretion, you may cause yourself

366
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,662
to be talked about
in society.

367
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,285
You're beginning
to attract attention.

368
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,703
I'm sure
they're only rumors.

369
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:38,342
You are always like that.

370
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:41,300
You don't like me to be dull,
and then you don't like it

371
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:43,056
when I go out
and enjoy myself.

372
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:46,378
Stop it. You Know
I can't stand it.

373
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,685
And I would like to know
what all this is about.

374
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:51,598
Your feelings are the affair
of your own conscience,

375
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:55,046
but I am duty-bound to point out
to you your duties.

376
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:58,109
Our lives have been joined
not by man but by God.

377
00:32:58,081 --> 00:33:00,776
Only a crime
can sever that union.

378
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:03,868
A crime of that nature brings
its own heavy punishment.

379
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,119
I don't understand
a thing you are saying.

380
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:09,259
And besides,
I'm desperately sleepy.

381
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:13,021
Anna, for God's sake, don't
speak like that. Perhaps I am mistaken.

382
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:17,139
But believe me, what I say
I say as much for my sake as for yours.

383
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,063
I am your husband,
and I love you, but if

384
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:22,541
-there are the slightest grounds...
-l have nothing to say.

385
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,587
It is really bedtime.

386
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,447
Here it is.

387
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:21,323
Stupid miss
with the right barrel.

388
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:29,720
Stiva?

389
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,186
When's Kitty
getting married?

390
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,626
She isn't thinking
about marriage.

391
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:38,721
She's very ill.

392
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,241
The doctors
have sent her abroad.

393
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,571
Where's Vronsky now?

394
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,944
He's in Petersburg.

395
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:59,679
He left shortly after you did. And
he's not been in Moscow once since then.

396
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:03,507
Do you know, Kostya,

397
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:06,652
I'll be frank with you.
It was your own fault.

398
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,586
You took fright at the sight of your rival.
Why didn't youfight it out?

399
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:13,797
Kitty was never
serious about him.

400
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,333
She was just attracted
by his good looks.

401
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,638
I tell you candidly

402
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:22,222
that when she returns
from her cure,

403
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:25,804
she'll be going to Yergushovo
for some quiet country life.

404
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:30,399
And that's not too far
from here, Kostya, is it?

405
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,370
I don't know
if you know,

406
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,318
but I don't care.
I'll tell you.

407
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:43,989
I did make an offer...

408
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,169
but I was rejected.

409
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:54,359
Now Kitty's nothing more than a
painful, humiliating memory. It's over.

410
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:58,302
I was hanging down
that dark well,

411
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:00,278
but the one thing
I held onto

412
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:02,134
was work.

413
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:06,278
I clutched it and clung to it
with all my might.

414
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,201
once I lost my temper
with a bailiff

415
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:13,031
and in a fit of anger took a scythe
and began mowing.

416
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,694
It calmed me,

417
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,745
So I resolved
to mow with them... all day long.

418
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:29,076
As I mowed,

419
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:30,770
I lost all count of time.

420
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,158
I had no idea whether
it was late or early.

421
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:39,338
A change came about my work,
which gave me intense satisfaction.

422
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,361
When I forgot what I was doing
and mowed without effort,

423
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,324
My line was almost
as smooth and good as Titus'.

424
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:52,939
More and more often now
came those moments of oblivion.

425
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:56,021
When it was not my arms
which swung the scythe,

426
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:59,814
the scythe seemed to mow
by itself.

427
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:03,522
Some external force
seemed to propel me on,

428
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:06,768
as though by magic...

429
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,418
the work did itself
regularly and carefully.

430
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,407
These were the most
blessed moments.

431
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,923
It was she.

432
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,763
It was Kitty...

433
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,580
on her way to Yergushovo.

434
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,919
Quiet, sweet.

435
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:46,665
Loot at her face, mama.

436
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:52,380
So spirited and yet so gentle.
I feel she could almost speak.

437
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:53,949
A fine horse.

438
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:58,502
Everybody's betting on you.
Not entirely for the right reasons.

439
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,010
What are you
implying, mama?

440
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,033
Don't be coy with me.

441
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,310
You must know how you've
become the center of gossip.

442
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:11,619
An affair
in the highest society

443
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,111
puts a finishing touch to
a brilliant young man.

444
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:17,998
Lord knows
I shouldn't preach, but there are those

445
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:21,657
who are becoming displeased with you,
Alexei. I want you to break it off.

446
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,327
I will not have anyone cast doubt
on the honor of my...

447
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:27,577
Her honor is nonexistent.
So is yours.

448
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:31,491
I've been told you've refused
a post in Moscow.

449
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,454
A promotion.

450
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,617
Mother, I would ask you
respectfully not to pry.

451
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,154
You only get one chance
at a career.

452
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:43,225
Why throw it all away
on some passion?

453
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:46,693
A brilliant, worldly liaison
I would approve of,

454
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:49,782
but not this desperate...

455
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:51,808
Oh, if my love were some ordinary,

456
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:54,019
vulgar society intrigue,

457
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,218
you would leave me alone.

458
00:39:56,909 --> 00:40:00,004
You have not the remotest
idea what I feel.

459
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:04,546
I find the lying, the deceit,
the scheming intolerable.

460
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:06,264
Then give her up.

461
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,557
I wasn't expecting you.

462
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:48,148
Gracious, what cold hands.

463
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,455
You startled me.

464
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,876
I'm waiting for Seriozha. l...he went out
for a walk. They'll come back this way.

465
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,758
Forgive me. I couldn't go the day
without seeing you.

466
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,912
But shouldn't you be
preparing for the race?

467
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:02,839
What were you
thinking of?

468
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,530
Please tell me.

469
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:13,106
Anna, what's the matter?
I can see that something's wrong.

470
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,830
I'm going to have your baby.

471
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,921
Tell him everything
and leave him.

472
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,228
-Oh, my son.
-You must be free of him!

473
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,238
Free to become
your mistress?

474
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,661
When can
I see you?When?

475
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:32,502
Tonight. 1:00.

476
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,742
Well, I must be
at the races.

477
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:53,365
Do you like horse racing?

478
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:01,329
Good-bye.

479
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:04,893
Seriozha, there is
no need to be so rude.

480
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:07,644
Papa told me always
to be truthful.

481
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:23,813
Save your strength
for the finish.

482
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:25,341
Fine.

483
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:29,957
Watch out for the water jump.

484
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:38,788
Are you riding today?

485
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,913
Here we are!

486
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:50,900
There is so much splendors here.
one's eyes are dazzled.

487
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:52,576
I will be staying the night.

488
00:42:52,812 --> 00:42:55,924
I am sure you are glad
we can be together.

489
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:36,414
We can go
if you like.

490
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,073
I again
offer you my arm

491
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,866
if you want
to be going.

492
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:21,702
I'm obliged to tell you
that your behavior...

493
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,878
What about my behavior?

494
00:45:22,826 --> 00:45:24,452
Be careful.

495
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:31,035
The despair you were unable to hide
when one of the riders fell.

496
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,818
Possibly I am mistaken.

497
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,887
in that case,
I beg your pardon.

498
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:45,370
I listen to you,
but I'm thinking of him.

499
00:45:46,674 --> 00:45:49,201
I love him
and I'm his mistress.

500
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:52,093
I can't endure you,

501
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:55,103
and I'm desperately unhappy.

502
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:02,025
You can do
what you like with me.

503
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:22,101
Is everything all right ma'am?

504
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:24,121
What time is it?

505
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:26,590
Almost midnight ma'am.

506
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,255
I've told my husband everything. I must
see you. Come at once to the house.

507
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:40,301
Count Vronsky!

508
00:46:41,974 --> 00:46:44,377
Ah, General Serpuhovsky!

509
00:46:44,855 --> 00:46:46,939
Brooding on your misfortune?
It won't do at all.

510
00:46:46,855 --> 00:46:48,272
Come on. Let's go and
have something to drink.

511
00:46:48,215 --> 00:46:51,685
I heard news of your promotion. I was
delighted and not a bit surprised.

512
00:46:51,898 --> 00:46:55,535
I heard you refused an important
post. Men like you are wanted.

513
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:58,346
-By whom?
-By Russia.

514
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,300
Russia needs men.

515
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:04,331
-The communists are gathering force.
-There're no such things as communists.

516
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:07,771
Scheming people always have to invent
some dangerous, noxious party.

517
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:09,817
-It's an old trick.
-Oh, well, I won't fight you.

518
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,796
Shall we go outside? I heard Therese
is going to perform as lady Eve.

519
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:16,677
I like to see that kind of show
with a gypsy girl on my knee.

520
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:20,388
-I'm afraid I've an assignation.
-Assignation? No, you don't Vronsky, old boy.

521
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:23,451
Karenin arrived this afternoon.
Saw him at the races.

522
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:25,247
I wouldn't keep
that appointment.

523
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:15,199
I took the liberty of ordering you
some brandy and cucumbers.

524
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,833
Drink the brandy.

525
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:33,791
Oh, and, this came for you.

526
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:40,598
Bad news?

527
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:43,198
She's told him
everything.

528
00:48:44,977 --> 00:48:46,854
I must go to her.

529
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:01,211
What do you want?!

530
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:04,368
Sit down! I have something
to say to you.

531
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:06,708
I know l... I've done wrong
and I'm...

532
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,139
Whatever your conduct may have been,
I don't consider myself justified

533
00:49:10,106 --> 00:49:13,066
in severing the ties through which a
higher power has bound us.

534
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:14,492
I shall ignore it

535
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:19,562
as long as the world knows nothing of it,
as long as my name is not disgraced.

536
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:22,336
And therefore I simply
warn you that our relations

537
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,124
must remain as they've always been.

538
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:27,147
-l can't be your wife while l...
-So you see nothing wrong with

539
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:29,934
your infidelity yet refuse to perform
the same duties for your husband!

540
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:32,024
What do you want
from me?

541
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,812
I want you to never
see him again!

542
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:38,694
I want you to be
a dutiful wife!

543
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:41,821
I can't change
what has happened.

544
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:54,867
Well, understand this.

545
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:57,917
I'll go to Moscow. I will not return
to this house again.

546
00:49:57,804 --> 00:50:00,706
I'll divorce you
on the grounds of adultery.

547
00:50:00,684 --> 00:50:02,503
My son will go
to my sister's.

548
00:50:03,686 --> 00:50:06,738
No. You must leave me Seriozha.
You don't love him.

549
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:10,422
I've even lost
affection for my son

550
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:14,218
because he is associated
with my loathing for you!

551
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,228
But all the same,
I shall take him.

552
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,875
You are a whore.
You have no legal rights.

553
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:21,036
Alexei Alexandrovitch,
leave me Seriozha.

554
00:50:21,212 --> 00:50:23,697
You know I can't live
without him.

555
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,363
If you'll conduct yourself
so that neither society

556
00:50:34,335 --> 00:50:37,238
nor the servants can find
anything to say against you,

557
00:50:37,218 --> 00:50:40,287
you can enjoy all the privileges
of a respectable wife

558
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:42,912
without fulfilling
the duties of one.

559
00:50:45,822 --> 00:50:48,465
and you may
keep your son.

560
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,763
Late as usual.

561
00:51:44,016 --> 00:51:47,070
-You have a lot of people here.
-Who's here?

562
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,460
Is Kitty here?

563
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:55,118
I never did quite believe that there
was anything wrong with my lungs,

564
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:59,389
but the seclusion and quiet
of Karlsbad were all helpful to me.

565
00:52:00,294 --> 00:52:03,214
I learned how to help care
for the other patients,

566
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:05,876
those with serious ailments...

567
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,174
and the work suited me.

568
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:10,935
I learned that there are
so many more important...

569
00:52:10,864 --> 00:52:12,516
I saw you last summer

570
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,620
Oh, you didn't see me,
but I saw you.

571
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,498
Where?

572
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:21,603
You were driving to Yergushovo.
My estate's on the way.

573
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,043
It was very early in the morning.
You were probably only just awake.

574
00:52:26,037 --> 00:52:30,358
You had a splendid team
of horses with bells.

575
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,151
You flashed by
in a second.

576
00:52:33,204 --> 00:52:36,539
I saw you through the window.
Your head was like this.

577
00:52:37,647 --> 00:52:39,442
And you were playing

578
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,519
with the ribbons of your cap,

579
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:47,656
thinking about
something very deeply.

580
00:52:49,097 --> 00:52:52,218
I wish I knew what
you were thinking then.

581
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:54,359
Really?

582
00:52:54,982 --> 00:52:57,277
I don't remember.

583
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:09,229
Don't go.

584
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,887
I've a question I've been wanting
to ask youfor a long time.

585
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:19,045
What is it?

586
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:23,557
Here.

587
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,573
That's the first letters
of the words.

588
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:39,896
What is that word?

589
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:42,004
-Never.
-Is it something I once said?

590
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,669
I know what it is.

591
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:53,439
"When you told me it could not be...

592
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:57,639
...did that mean never...

593
00:53:58,558 --> 00:54:00,436
...or then?"

594
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:23,341
I don't know.

595
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:28,155
"Then I could not answer
differently."

596
00:54:29,826 --> 00:54:32,079
Only then?

597
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:20,184
He will have reached the church
any moment now.

598
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,200
Word will come.

599
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:37,431
Oh! This is impossible!

600
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:40,426
Don't worry. You'll just
have to wear mine.

601
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:43,800
Yes, well, if I was going to do that,
I should've done it a long time ago!

602
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,581
Everything will
turn out just fine.

603
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,017
Don't you worry.

604
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,567
I went out to buy a new shirt.
All the shops were shut...

605
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:19,265
I was beginning to think that you had
made up your mind to run away.

606
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,188
What happened to me was
so silly, I was...

607
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,480
I'm ashamed
to tell you.

608
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:53,057
Kitty should have
stepped on the mat first.

609
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:54,726
Whoever does
runs the household.

610
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:56,614
I did.

611
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:58,447
What about you, Dolly?

612
00:56:58,878 --> 00:56:59,879
I don't remember.

613
00:56:59,998 --> 00:57:01,834
Why on earth not?

614
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:05,469
I was so in love.

615
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:41,351
Sir, Madame Karenin
miscarried last night.

616
00:57:41,796 --> 00:57:43,841
My God, how is she?

617
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:46,950
Very bad. The doctor
is with her now.

618
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,050
Who is here?

619
00:58:00,052 --> 00:58:00,969
Is... is she...

620
00:58:01,013 --> 00:58:04,042
She has
a very high fever.

621
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:09,160
Ana Arkadyevna,
he has come.

622
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:15,597
Has Seriozha had his dinner?
I Know they will allforget.

623
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,231
I am entirely
in your hands.

624
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:20,369
He must be moved
into the corner room...

625
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:24,597
Maria told
to sleep with him.

626
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:33,832
I'm not afraid of you.

627
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:41,425
I know I'm dying now.
You ask him.

628
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:46,698
I feel it already.

629
00:58:49,014 --> 00:58:52,085
I want only one thing...

630
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,999
for you to forgive me.

631
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:58,730
Forgive me completely..

632
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,186
There is some hope..

633
00:59:42,863 --> 00:59:44,907
I must stay.

634
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,794
She may ask for me..

635
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:57,230
I've long wanted to be
revenged on you and her.

636
00:59:59,197 --> 01:00:03,337
When I got the telegram.
I came here with the same sentiments.

637
01:00:05,162 --> 01:00:06,831
But I saw her...

638
01:00:07,243 --> 01:00:08,996
and forgave her.

639
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,636
And the happiness of
forgiving her revealed to me

640
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,487
my duty.

641
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:17,378
I will not
forsake her,

642
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:22,262
and I will never utter a word
of reproach to you.

643
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,925
Should she want to see you,
I will let you know.

644
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:31,849
Now I think
you'd better leave.

645
01:01:18,026 --> 01:01:20,113
ldiot!

646
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:24,533
You had the misfortune to fall in love
with man who's not your husband.

647
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:28,406
This is a misfortune,
but this is a fact.

648
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:30,538
Your husband
has forgiven you.

649
01:01:31,197 --> 01:01:33,366
Also a fact.

650
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,441
The question is,

651
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:37,278
can you go on living
with your husband?

652
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,264
Do you want to?
And what does he want?

653
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:42,727
I don't know.

654
01:01:42,729 --> 01:01:44,815
I don't know at all.

655
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,825
I feel I'm flying headlong
over a precipice.

656
01:01:49,935 --> 01:01:51,854
We'll catch you,

657
01:01:51,776 --> 01:01:54,305
and we won't
let youfall.

658
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:59,210
There is
nothing left for me,

659
01:02:00,104 --> 01:02:02,090
except for it
to be all over.

660
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,870
Look at you.

661
01:02:56,954 --> 01:03:00,568
I hardly know you
with this short hair.

662
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,879
You've grown so pretty,
but how pale you are.

663
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:04,885
I'm still very weak.

664
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:07,186
We'll go to ltaly.

665
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:09,147
You'll soon get well.

666
01:03:09,284 --> 01:03:10,936
We'll live together
as husband and wife.

667
01:03:11,045 --> 01:03:12,296
You'll be ruined.

668
01:03:12,407 --> 01:03:14,977
I resigned
my commission.

669
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:17,204
Now all I want
is you.

670
01:03:51,442 --> 01:03:52,735
My dear friend,

671
01:03:54,324 --> 01:03:57,229
you must not give way
to your grief.

672
01:03:57,607 --> 01:04:00,094
You willfind support,

673
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,901
but seek it not in me,

674
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:04,892
though I beg you

675
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,577
to believe in
our friendship.

676
01:04:06,735 --> 01:04:08,905
I will set to work..

677
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:12,628
I will be your housekeeper.
Don't thank me.

678
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,389
I do it not of myself.

679
01:04:16,664 --> 01:04:18,316
How can I help
thanking you?

680
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:20,089
You must...

681
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:21,192
thank Him,

682
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:23,963
and ask for His help.

683
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:27,676
ln Him alone
can we find peace.

684
01:04:35,882 --> 01:04:37,885
My dear, dear boy.

685
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:41,341
How unhappy you must be.

686
01:04:42,606 --> 01:04:44,509
I'm quite well,
countess.

687
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:48,110
Your poor father is...

688
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:50,819
to distraught

689
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,772
to tell you himself,

690
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:55,003
so he's left it to me.

691
01:04:55,818 --> 01:04:58,697
He is...
a saint,

692
01:04:58,701 --> 01:04:59,869
you know?

693
01:05:01,905 --> 01:05:02,822
Your mother...

694
01:05:04,466 --> 01:05:05,425
is dead.

695
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:30,747
Letters have arrived from town,
Constantine Dmitrich.

696
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:35,534
You see, your lady's settled me here,
told me to sit a little with her.

697
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:38,316
Here.

698
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:40,749
I opened
your letter, too.

699
01:05:40,777 --> 01:05:44,015
I think it's from that woman,
your brother's,

700
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,009
and this is a letter
from home.

701
01:05:46,062 --> 01:05:49,534
Dolly took Grisha and Tanya to a
children's party at the Sarmatskys'.

702
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,691
Tanya went
as a French marquise..

703
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,247
What's...
what's the matter?

704
01:05:57,112 --> 01:05:59,474
My... my brother
Nikolai is dying.

705
01:06:03,238 --> 01:06:05,767
l... I must go to him
I'll leave tomorrow.

706
01:06:22,975 --> 01:06:24,018
Let's go.

707
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:37,737
Why didn't you
let me know sooner?

708
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,373
What is so awful
for me...

709
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:32,245
is that I can't help...

710
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:36,025
remembering him as he was
when he was young.

711
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:43,061
you can't imagine
what a charming boy he was.

712
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:53,550
But I didn't
understand him then.

713
01:08:06,026 --> 01:08:07,737
ln infinite time...

714
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:10,824
in infinite matter...

715
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:13,636
in infinite space...

716
01:08:14,354 --> 01:08:16,590
an organic cell
stands out,

717
01:08:17,356 --> 01:08:20,386
will hold together
awhile...

718
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,493
and then bursts.

719
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:26,382
And that cell is me.

720
01:08:28,126 --> 01:08:29,861
I cannot live without
knowing.

721
01:08:30,047 --> 01:08:33,770
what I am and why I am here,
and that I cannot know.

722
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:37,770
So, therefore, I
have no reason to live.

723
01:08:39,456 --> 01:08:40,749
What?

724
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,753
I'm pregnant.

725
01:08:51,466 --> 01:08:53,592
Well, don't spare
me now.

726
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,654
It's going
to be perfection.

727
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,856
-I'm not going to finish it.
-Why? Why ever not?

728
01:09:00,954 --> 01:09:04,384
Because its defects will become
more and more obvious.

729
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:08,477
I can't fool myself
that I am an artist.

730
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:10,336
I am going
to give it up.

731
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:26,395
I confess I hardly miss
Seriozha at all.

732
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,782
But you do.

733
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:34,262
Yes.

734
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,693
Let's go back to Russia.

735
01:09:45,754 --> 01:09:47,574
Karenin will
grant us a divorce.

736
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,285
We'll get married,
and we'll be together.

737
01:09:49,437 --> 01:09:53,410
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.
I'm so unpardonable happy here,

738
01:09:54,322 --> 01:09:57,142
away from all of them,
all of that.

739
01:09:57,444 --> 01:09:59,014
I thought you were, too.

740
01:10:00,368 --> 01:10:01,828
Being with you

741
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:04,920
is the realization of
all my deepest desires,

742
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:07,753
but there is nothing
I can do here.

743
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:09,943
I need a purpose.

744
01:10:10,897 --> 01:10:14,786
That's what I like so much,
having you all to myself.

745
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:19,232
Seriozha
needs his mother.

746
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,923
Dear Lydia lvanovna,

747
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:29,785
Forgive me for
reminding you of myself.

748
01:10:29,832 --> 01:10:32,970
Count Vronsky and I are
returning to St. Petersburg.

749
01:10:33,557 --> 01:10:35,459
I am unhappy at
being parted from my son.

750
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,582
I beg to be allowed
to see him.

751
01:10:38,842 --> 01:10:42,647
Will you send Seriozha to me, or should
I come to the house at some fixed hour?

752
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:46,069
You cannot conceive
the yearning I have to see him

753
01:10:46,048 --> 01:10:49,269
and so can not conceive the gratitude
your help will arouse in me.

754
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:51,060
Anna.

755
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,949
I don't think
I can refuse her.

756
01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:57,690
My dear friend,
You never see evil in anybody..

757
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:00,424
Her love for her son
exacts...

758
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,629
But is it love?

759
01:11:02,703 --> 01:11:05,565
My friend,
is it sincere?

760
01:11:06,265 --> 01:11:09,195
Have we the right to toy with the
feelings of that little angel?

761
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:10,958
He thinks she's dead,

762
01:11:11,069 --> 01:11:12,863
and he prays for her

763
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:15,272
and besieges God
have mercy on her sins,

764
01:11:15,794 --> 01:11:17,004
and it is...

765
01:11:18,035 --> 01:11:19,370
better.

766
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,876
Madame,

767
01:11:24,641 --> 01:11:27,212
to remind
your son of yous

768
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:31,338
Might lead to questions on his part
which it would be impossible to answer.

769
01:11:31,648 --> 01:11:33,525
I beg you to interpret
your husband's refusal

770
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:36,187
in the spirit
of Christian love.

771
01:11:50,385 --> 01:11:54,149
I am here to tell you that I look upon my
union with Madame Karenina as marriage.

772
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:58,938
If you wish to be on good terms with me
then you must be on good terms with her.

773
01:12:01,114 --> 01:12:02,908
Our intimate friends

774
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:05,792
can and must look at it
in the proper light.

775
01:12:05,678 --> 01:12:08,917
I for one am so glad
you are back.

776
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:11,877
I can imagine how horrible our
Petersburg must seem to you

777
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:13,832
after your
delightful travels.

778
01:12:14,326 --> 01:12:17,964
-How about the divorce? Is that all settled?
-I'm only waiting for Karenin.

779
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:21,199
People will throw
stones at me, I know,

780
01:12:21,372 --> 01:12:22,982
but I shall come
and see Anna.

781
01:12:23,053 --> 01:12:24,915
I will ignore
the conventions,

782
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:27,144
but other starchy people
will give you the cold shoulder

783
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:29,210
until you are married,.

784
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,470
and that's
so simple nowadays.

785
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:34,759
Of course, I cannot invite her to my
home. I have daughters growing up.

786
01:12:35,544 --> 01:12:36,879
How can you
say that..

787
01:12:36,826 --> 01:12:39,745
When everyone knows you were
Tushkevich's mistress?

788
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:43,444
How dare you
make comparisons?

789
01:12:45,232 --> 01:12:46,400
Aliosha, darling,

790
01:12:46,994 --> 01:12:50,066
You hardly have
the moral high ground.

791
01:13:12,217 --> 01:13:14,453
The doctor.
It's time.

792
01:13:19,744 --> 01:13:20,912
Are you all right?

793
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:38,865
Get out of here,
Kostya! Go!

794
01:13:49,369 --> 01:13:51,313
Lord have mercy on us
and help us.

795
01:14:10,628 --> 01:14:11,504
A boy too!

796
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,284
You may ease your mind.

797
01:14:14,511 --> 01:14:15,680
All is well.

798
01:14:15,673 --> 01:14:18,493
Show him to his Papa!

799
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,783
That's how they are
when they come out.

800
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:30,084
This one is a beauty.

801
01:15:25,335 --> 01:15:26,795
Seriozha...

802
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:31,495
my darling.

803
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:49,289
They told me
you were dead.

804
01:15:49,394 --> 01:15:51,088
You didn't believe it,
my precious.

805
01:15:51,237 --> 01:15:53,365
I never believed it!

806
01:15:57,482 --> 01:15:59,885
Oh no, you'd never
have let her in!

807
01:16:00,045 --> 01:16:03,099
Ten year's service and nothing but
kindness from her,

808
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:06,231
and you'd have got up
and shown her the door.

809
01:16:06,131 --> 01:16:09,853
He'll get up presently and
you will be out on the streets.

810
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,152
Don't go. He won't
come just yet.

811
01:16:14,297 --> 01:16:16,325
Seriozha, my darling,
you must love him.

812
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:18,204
He's better than I am,
and I have been wicked to him.

813
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:20,252
When you're grown up,
you will understand.

814
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,148
Don't go.
Mama!

815
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:31,485
Get out! Our door
is closed to you!

816
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:34,730
You're not welcome here!
You deserted your son!

817
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:50,229
The laudanum prescribed for Ana
after the loss of her child

818
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:54,031
Now became the opiate used to
deaden the pain of Seriozha's loss.

819
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:21,503
Why shouldn't I go?

820
01:17:21,557 --> 01:17:22,517
You are going.

821
01:17:23,559 --> 01:17:25,879
Oh, of course, there's
no reason whatever.

822
01:17:27,402 --> 01:17:29,222
That's exactly
what I say.

823
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:33,550
Anna, for heaven's sake,
what has come over you?

824
01:17:34,448 --> 01:17:36,353
I don't understand
what you mean.

825
01:17:38,216 --> 01:17:39,746
You know you can't go
into the opera.

826
01:17:41,985 --> 01:17:43,155
Why not?

827
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:46,456
I'm not going alone.

828
01:17:46,477 --> 01:17:48,549
I'm... I'm going
with princess Varvara.

829
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:52,488
Princess Varvara...

830
01:17:53,532 --> 01:17:55,604
Is little more
than a courtesan.

831
01:17:56,499 --> 01:17:58,155
She's no worse
than the others.

832
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:02,286
Besides, I am not ashamed
of what I have done.

833
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:04,432
I'm not ashamed
of my love for you.

834
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:11,677
And whom
are you accompanying?

835
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:19,535
You've been out
with your mother quite a bit lately.

836
01:18:19,673 --> 01:18:21,496
Anna, she is my mother.

837
01:18:21,518 --> 01:18:25,245
I hear your mother has taken on
princess Sorokina as a companion.

838
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:30,348
Why don't you make your mother
happy and marry her?

839
01:18:30,257 --> 01:18:31,828
Anna, I have not
the slightest interest

840
01:18:32,102 --> 01:18:34,104
in princess Sorokina.

841
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,580
How do you think
that makes me feel?

842
01:18:40,442 --> 01:18:41,319
What?

843
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:45,947
How am l
supposed to feel?.

844
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:49,323
You spend your evenings
with a pretty young girl.

845
01:18:51,307 --> 01:18:53,087
What do I know?
Only what you tell me.

846
01:18:53,753 --> 01:18:55,576
Oh, you don't trust me?

847
01:18:55,918 --> 01:18:58,007
Why can't I go out?

848
01:19:00,929 --> 01:19:04,379
I love you, and nothing
else matters to me..

849
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:07,236
So long as you
haven't changed....

850
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:11,542
As long
as you still love me.

851
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:17,365
Oh, look at me.

852
01:19:19,854 --> 01:19:21,885
All we need
is the divorce.

853
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:26,668
I know how difficult your
situation must be until then,

854
01:19:27,912 --> 01:19:31,348
but, please, don't make matters worse.
Please, please, don't go.

855
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:34,220
Oh, I'll stay,
as you wish..

856
01:19:58,182 --> 01:19:59,603
Princess Sorokina.

857
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:02,033
Your mama
is asking for you.

858
01:20:02,233 --> 01:20:03,361
Good evening, mama.

859
01:20:03,956 --> 01:20:05,862
I'm sorry to be late.

860
01:20:05,881 --> 01:20:09,191
Well, you're here now,
and that's all that matters.

861
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:04,538
You're not worthy of him.
You've lost your child! You're a whore.

862
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,823
You're a whore!

863
01:21:08,466 --> 01:21:10,514
You deserted him!

864
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:37,078
Excuse me. You seem to be putting me
in the position of defendant. I was given

865
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:42,105
to understand that Anna declines a
divorce if I insist on keeping the boy.

866
01:21:42,305 --> 01:21:45,381
I replied to her in that sense
and considered the matter closed.

867
01:21:45,353 --> 01:21:49,974
Alexei Alexandrovich,
you are a good man.

868
01:21:50,084 --> 01:21:52,408
Put yourself in
her position for a moment.

869
01:21:52,568 --> 01:21:53,972
She's moved to Moscow.

870
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:57,782
She's been there 6 months now,
each day expecting your decision.

871
01:21:57,862 --> 01:22:02,007
I'm a believer now. I can't go against the
teachings of Christianity in such a matter.

872
01:22:02,192 --> 01:22:05,878
Why, divorce is sanctioned,
even by the church.

873
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:08,653
I must think it over.

874
01:22:08,606 --> 01:22:10,971
I must seek guidance.

875
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,024
What do I see?

876
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:28,007
Ah, Yes. That's right.

877
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:31,418
We must go away.
I long to be in the country,

878
01:22:31,301 --> 01:22:33,055
and there's nothing
to keep you here, is there?

879
01:22:32,984 --> 01:22:36,879
-My one wish is to get away.
-You know, it came over me like an

880
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,764
absolute inspiration. Why should we
go on waiting here for the divorce?

881
01:22:40,842 --> 01:22:44,278
I've made up my mind that it
shan't influence my life anymore.

882
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,940
-Do you agree?
-Oh, yes..

883
01:22:47,338 --> 01:22:49,161
Well, how was
your dinner party?

884
01:22:49,743 --> 01:22:51,356
Oh, the dinner
was first-rate

885
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:53,849
and the boat race
and all that quite enjoyable.

886
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:55,483
Well, when are we off?

887
01:22:56,228 --> 01:22:58,042
The sooner the better.

888
01:22:58,065 --> 01:23:00,129
We can't get off
tomorrow, I'm afraid,

889
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:02,680
but we could be ready
the day after.

890
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:04,584
Oh, no. Wait a moment.

891
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:07,685
The day after tomorrow is Sunday,
and I have to see mama.

892
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:08,901
-You could go there tomorrow.
- No, I'm going there on business

893
01:23:08,848 --> 01:23:12,894
to do with the power of attorney,
and the money won't be ready tomorrow.

894
01:23:13,562 --> 01:23:15,460
ln that case, then,
we won't go at all.

895
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:17,136
I won't go any later!
Monday or not at all!

896
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:20,057
Why? There's
no sense in that..

897
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,173
You see no sense in it because...

898
01:23:22,828 --> 01:23:24,935
because you care
nothing for me.

899
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:26,784
You seem unable
to see my position.

900
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:29,805
How do you think I feel
cooped up in these rooms?

901
01:23:29,778 --> 01:23:32,758
But you are free.
Yes, you are free,

902
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:37,170
and if you don't love me anymore, that
would be better and more honest to say so.

903
01:23:37,126 --> 01:23:39,939
Oh, really! This
is becoming unbearable!

904
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:43,815
Why do you try my patience?
It has its limits.

905
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:44,837
What do you mean
by that?

906
01:23:44,795 --> 01:23:46,210
I mean...

907
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,713
I mean, well,
what do you want of me?

908
01:23:48,668 --> 01:23:51,648
What I want is that you should not desert
me as you are thinking of doing.

909
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:54,796
No. I don't want that.
what I want is your love,

910
01:23:55,459 --> 01:23:57,148
but it has gone,
so it is all over.

911
01:23:57,895 --> 01:23:58,727
Wait. Wait. Wait!

912
01:23:59,892 --> 01:24:01,581
What is this all about?

913
01:24:02,048 --> 01:24:05,886
I said that me must put off our departure
for a matter of 3 days,

914
01:24:06,002 --> 01:24:08,940
and you, Anna, sit by accusing me of
lying and being dishonorable.

915
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:13,547
It is a matter of complete indifference to me
what your mother thinks and whom she

916
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:16,310
wants to marry you to.

917
01:24:16,746 --> 01:24:18,227
But we're not talking
about that.

918
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,158
Precisely about that!

919
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:23,401
I know all about that
little princess Sorokina,

920
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:25,024
and let me tell you,
a heartless woman..

921
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:28,141
Be she old or not old, your mother or
anyone else is of no consequence to me,

922
01:24:28,849 --> 01:24:31,220
and I do not want to have
anything to do with her.

923
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:34,646
I will not have you speak
disrespectfully of my mother.

924
01:24:35,878 --> 01:24:37,877
There's a limit
to my endurance.

925
01:24:58,643 --> 01:25:00,432
Why didn't I die?

926
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:32,055
Mashka is going
to eat your banana!

927
01:27:19,509 --> 01:27:21,240
Who is that telegram from?

928
01:27:21,427 --> 01:27:23,242
-It's from Stiva.
-Can I see it?

929
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:24,669
It is addressed to me.

930
01:27:24,623 --> 01:27:26,479
What secrets
can Stiva have from me?

931
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:29,836
I don't want you to see it because
Stiva has a passion for wiring.

932
01:27:29,975 --> 01:27:31,664
Why telegraph
when nothing is settled?

933
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:32,885
He wires:

934
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:36,710
could get nothing out of him.
Promises definite answer soon.

935
01:27:36,604 --> 01:27:38,685
Read it yourself.

936
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,760
Little hope, and I'll do everything
possible and impossible.

937
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:47,198
I don't care about
the divorce anymore,

938
01:27:48,426 --> 01:27:50,465
And there was not the slightest
necessity to hide this from me.

939
01:27:50,383 --> 01:27:53,114
I just want things
to be definite.

940
01:27:53,259 --> 01:27:56,779
I am sure your irritability is due to
the uncertainty of your position.

941
01:27:56,732 --> 01:27:59,655
And why did princess Sorokina
deliver this telegram?

942
01:28:01,845 --> 01:28:03,718
She did not.

943
01:28:05,441 --> 01:28:07,438
This arrived earlier
while you were sleeping.

944
01:28:07,357 --> 01:28:10,671
Princess Sorokina came with the money
and the documents from my mother.

945
01:28:10,633 --> 01:28:12,156
I couldn't get them
yesterday.

946
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:16,369
I didn't want anything
to delay our departure.

947
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:19,578
By the way,

948
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:22,658
we are definitely
going tomorrow, aren't we?

949
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:26,518
You are...

950
01:28:26,607 --> 01:28:28,564
but not me.

951
01:28:33,078 --> 01:28:35,059
Ana, we can't
go on like this.

952
01:28:35,075 --> 01:28:37,156
You are, but not I!

953
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:39,109
This is intolerable!

954
01:28:41,226 --> 01:28:43,831
You will be sorry
for this.

955
01:33:46,444 --> 01:33:48,133
God,
forgive me everything.

956
01:33:59,703 --> 01:34:01,868
I have here...

957
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:05,379
the latest dispatch...
from the front!

958
01:34:05,415 --> 01:34:09,187
The infidel muslims
have been driven back!

959
01:34:14,042 --> 01:34:15,415
We russians...

960
01:34:15,959 --> 01:34:16,833
have flown to help

961
01:34:17,997 --> 01:34:20,144
our Serbian Slavonic brothers,

962
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,761
our fellow Christians!

963
01:34:29,258 --> 01:34:31,714
Count Vronsky.

964
01:34:31,655 --> 01:34:33,652
Perhaps you'd rather not have seen me.
If so, please don't hesitate to say.

965
01:34:33,573 --> 01:34:35,305
I can always find
another compartment.

966
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:38,421
No. Please.

967
01:34:40,762 --> 01:34:43,160
The Serbian war
is a blessing for me.

968
01:34:44,716 --> 01:34:48,655
As a man I have the merit that my
life is of no value to me.

969
01:34:50,787 --> 01:34:55,250
I'm glad there's something for which I may
lay down the life which isn't simply useless,

970
01:34:55,459 --> 01:34:57,373
but loathsome to me.

971
01:34:58,935 --> 01:35:00,833
Anyone is welcome to it.

972
01:35:02,968 --> 01:35:05,842
I know the dreadful
thing you have suffered,

973
01:35:05,843 --> 01:35:08,631
But I beg you not to continue
on this course you are following.

974
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,419
I am doing my duty
as a Russian...

975
01:35:10,518 --> 01:35:11,641
and a Christian.

976
01:35:12,354 --> 01:35:14,518
Please, hear me out.

977
01:35:17,227 --> 01:35:20,040
I saw your lady only once.

978
01:35:22,898 --> 01:35:26,211
I wish I'd spoken up then,
but I did not.

979
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:30,671
which is why I cannot
remain silent now.

980
01:35:31,844 --> 01:35:34,409
Ever since the death
of my brother,

981
01:35:34,561 --> 01:35:38,458
all I have been searching for are
answers to questions like,

982
01:35:38,554 --> 01:35:40,120
"what am I?" , "why am I here?"

983
01:35:40,632 --> 01:35:42,130
"What am I living for?"

984
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,842
When, suddenly,
it all became clear to me.

985
01:35:43,986 --> 01:35:47,783
I'd been living on spiritual truths
that I'd drunK in with my mother's milk,

986
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,798
but I'd never
acKnowledged them.

987
01:35:51,095 --> 01:35:53,676
I know what is right and wrong.
I wasn't taught this..

988
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:56,868
It was given to me, as it is to everyone.
I discovered nothing.

989
01:35:57,406 --> 01:35:59,470
I merely opened my eyes
to what I knew.

990
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:05,096
For me it is too late.

991
01:36:05,155 --> 01:36:08,868
As a man, I am finished. As a weapon,
I may be of some use.

992
01:36:11,863 --> 01:36:13,719
Don't think ill of me.

993
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,537
I have lost too much.

994
01:36:18,693 --> 01:36:22,698
All I ask is to be able
to remember Anna as she once was...

995
01:36:24,246 --> 01:36:26,144
when I first met her.

996
01:36:26,641 --> 01:36:30,205
I try to bring back
those moments, but I cannot.

997
01:36:30,955 --> 01:36:33,270
I cannot
see her face.

998
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,853
I can only see her
laid out

999
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:38,591
in the railway shed
where they took her.

1000
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,079
She was...

1001
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,310
This new feeling
has not changed me.

1002
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:20,661
It has not made me happy
and enlightened all of a sudden

1003
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,733
as I dreamed it would.

1004
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,873
just liKe the way it was with
my feeling for my son.

1005
01:37:25,752 --> 01:37:28,715
-Come to the nursery at once.
-Is something wrong with Mitya?

1006
01:37:29,347 --> 01:37:30,804
There was no surprise
about this, either.

1007
01:37:30,745 --> 01:37:34,100
-What's going on?
-Mitya wants to see you.

1008
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,136
But be it faith or not.
I don't Know what it is.

1009
01:37:36,056 --> 01:37:41,351
Through suffering, this feeling has crept
just as imperceptibly into my heart.

1010
01:37:42,046 --> 01:37:43,961
He knows me.

1011
01:37:44,923 --> 01:37:47,820
and has lodged
itself firmly there.

1012
01:37:51,434 --> 01:37:55,147
I shall still be unable to understand
with my reason why I pray,

1013
01:37:56,147 --> 01:37:59,252
and I shall
still go on praying.

1014
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,378
But my llfe now...

1015
01:38:02,857 --> 01:38:05,863
my whole llfe... independent of
anything that can happen to me,

1016
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:10,902
every minute of it is no longer
meaningless as it was before,

1017
01:38:11,644 --> 01:38:13,583
but has a positive meaning
of goodness

1018
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,489
with which I have
the power to invest it.
