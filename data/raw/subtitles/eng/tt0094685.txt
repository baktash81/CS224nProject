00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:08,809
Good morning.

4
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:12,640
Good morning, Miep.

5
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,505
Although, it's not
so good, I admit.

6
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,959
Still, it's not
the end of the world.

7
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,548
Ellie here thinks
it's the end of the world.

8
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,240
Well, I'm happy delay,
that's progress perhaps,

9
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,448
but not the end.

10
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:29,139
Oh, Miep,
isn't it terrible?

11
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,762
Maybe it won't
be so bad, Ellie.

12
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,246
We'll just have
to wait and see.

13
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,904
The bright side,
that's the ticket.

14
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:37,562
If it won't be so bad, why did
the queen run away to England?

15
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:40,599
Wilhelmina did not run away.

16
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,395
She'll do far better
for us all in England as a...

17
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,328
symbol of a free
Netherlands

18
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:48,020
than as a captive
monarch in The Hague.

19
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:50,057
Also it must have
infuriated Hitler.

20
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:51,334
That's an added dividend.

21
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,267
And as for surrender, well...

22
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:55,856
Nothing will be the same.

23
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,582
Everything will
be different now.

24
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,894
They can't change
everything, Ellie,

25
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:00,895
not everything.

26
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,381
It's just a matter
of keeping up.

27
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:04,589
That's the ticket.

28
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:13,770
Well, so much for royal
declarations of neutrality.

29
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,532
It could've
been worse, Kraler.

30
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:19,155
Bear it in mind.

31
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:23,159
We might have been bombed
like Rotterdam.

32
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:26,300
Think of the devastation
of Rotterdam.

33
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,302
Think of the dead.

34
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:30,891
I was merely making an
observation, Koophuis,

35
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:33,825
not a judgment.

36
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,827
Coffee, Ellie.

37
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,243
Will it mean anything to the
business, Miep, do you think?

38
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,280
Oh, I don't
think so, Ellie.

39
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,523
Even the Germans
like jam.

40
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,255
Yes? Yes, sir.

41
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,366
Good morning,
Mr. Van Daan.

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,300
Hello, Miep,
how are you this morning?

43
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,890
Yes, well, we all have
to make the best of it, ay?

44
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,378
As much as they'll
permit us to, at least.

45
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:12,070
Would you like some coffee?
It's ready.

46
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,037
Not just now.

47
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:17,386
Thank you, Miep.

48
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,637
Come.

49
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:33,712
Good morning, Mr. Frank.

50
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:34,955
Good morning.

51
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,440
And as Mr. Cooper says,
not so good.

52
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,927
How are the others
taking it, Miep?

53
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,482
As well as can be expected,
I suppose.

54
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:47,243
When I left Germany in '33,
the Nazi's were saying

55
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,659
"Today, Germany,
tomorrow, the world."

56
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:54,699
Such a ridiculous boast
it seemed to us then.

57
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:58,565
Never the world,
surely, Mr. Frank.

58
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,016
Pray God.

59
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:04,778
So...

60
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,780
Meanwhile,
Mrs. Frank and I

61
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,368
are having a little
gathering on Saturday.

62
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:12,302
We would be very pleased
if you and Jan would come by.

63
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:15,892
Oh, that would be lovely,
Mr. Frank, thank you.

64
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:19,413
Life goes on.

65
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,738
Travis and Company.

66
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,912
<i> It's me.
</i><i> How are you so far?</i>

67
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,916
I'm trying not
to be too depressed,

68
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,815
not very successfully I fear.

69
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,610
Have you seen
any of them yet?

70
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:46,198
The master race?
Not yet.

71
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,545
I've been wondering
all morning what I'll do

72
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:48,891
the first time
I see them.

73
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:52,515
Oh, you'll look, and you look
away and you'll go on.

74
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,449
So will we all
as best we can.

75
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:56,623
What time will you
be finished tonight?

76
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:59,660
About 6:00,
I should think.

77
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:01,662
Shall we have dinner?

78
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:10,637
Mr. Frank doesn't seem to think
the business will be affected.

79
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,503
Particularly, since
we're a German firm.

80
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:17,264
I suppose that
may be so, but...

81
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,059
We'll just have
to wait and see.

82
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,409
I just realized
what's wrong.

83
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:27,654
Is something wrong?

84
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

85
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,348
Have you ever heard
it so quiet here?

86
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,904
That's what it is.

87
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:37,905
Of course.

88
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,320
I knew something
was different.

89
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:42,116
We can't let them make us
start talking in whispers.

90
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,051
It's only the first
chalk.

91
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:48,675
We'll go on.

92
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,788
We'll go on!

93
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,342
Yeah.

94
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,560
I want more
than ever now

95
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,322
for us to find a place
we can live together.

96
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,255
If only we'd found
something before the city

97
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,464
began to burst
with refugees.

98
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:23,572
But don't worry,

99
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,850
somewhere in Amsterdam
at this very moment,

100
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:29,094
a modest flat with an affordable
rent is being vacated.

101
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,372
That flat will be ours.

102
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,547
I guarantee it.

103
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,515
Do you have the address
by any chance?

104
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:39,380
I'm on optimist,
not a magician.

105
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,452
Hmm... That's good
enough for me.

106
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:02,438
Coming directly to the point,
Miss, may I call you Hermina?

107
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,579
Oh, if you like,
I rarely use my formal name.

108
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:09,341
Coming directly
to the point, Hermina,

109
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,240
I am, as I mentioned,

110
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:13,587
a representative
of The Amsterdam Chapter

111
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:16,556
of the German Girls Association
of the Netherlands.

112
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,697
Our purpose, as you may have
already presumed,

113
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,872
is to add your name to our
fast increasing roles

114
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:25,116
of our membership here
in Amsterdam.

115
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,740
A brochure outlining our
purposes and principals,

116
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,294
which I believe you'll
find quite inspiring.

117
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,746
Of course, it is about
Fuhrer Adolf Hitler.

118
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,990
Our membership application,

119
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,957
which is only
a formality of course,

120
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,925
but I believe you'll
find it very useful.

121
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,824
I suppose there's
been some mistake.

122
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,654
I'm not German, you see.

123
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:51,038
Born in Vienna,
Austria, 1909.

124
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,626
Emigrated to the
Netherlands 1920.

125
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:56,285
Presently with Mr. and Mrs.
Van Nuden, foster parents.

126
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:57,942
Religious application,
Catholic.

127
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,357
Presently possessing
a passport

128
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,980
of the National Socialist
Republic of Germany.

129
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:07,779
That I hold a German passport
was not by my choice, miss.

130
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:11,956
My passport was Austrian
until 1938 at the time

131
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,474
of the German occupation
of Austria

132
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,996
when I was forced to accept
a German passport.

133
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,585
Nonetheless,
I'm Austrian by birth,

134
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,933
and Dutch by choice, by virtue
of my great affection

135
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,661
for this country
and its people.

136
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:30,871
In view of your disloyal
attitude towards the fatherland,

137
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:34,219
it seems curious that you've
never become a naturalized

138
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,290
citizen of this country
from which you prefer

139
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,396
such misguided affection.

140
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,432
In recent years,
I've had occasion to regret

141
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:43,332
that carelessness,
never more so than now.

142
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:45,886
As for your
Furher's principals,

143
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:49,062
I think they may best
be judged by the suffering

144
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:51,478
they have caused for so many
thousands of innocent people.

145
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:55,240
The swastika is on my passport,
miss, not on me.

146
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:59,417
Bravo.

147
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:03,421
Those are the types that need
such telling off.

148
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,941
To our Dutch friends.

149
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,805
Our Dutch friends.

150
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:13,465
Still, I think it might have
been incautious of you, Miep.

151
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,434
If Miep chooses not to join
some silly little club

152
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,575
of those hysterical
female fascists,

153
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,163
it's none
of their business.

154
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,164
Yeah.

155
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,406
Perhaps.

156
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,442
More coffee, Mr. Gies?

157
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,030
Thank you.
No, Mrs. Frank.

158
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:28,826
I believe
I've had my fill.

159
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,243
You Germans like your coffee
strong all right.

160
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,831
Think this is strong?

161
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,936
You should have tasted our
coffee at home.

162
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,593
This is only
refugee coffee.

163
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,526
Coffee that the spoon
will stand up in,

164
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,703
that's what's wanted.
God, how I miss it.

165
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,878
If only that was all that was
to be missed of home, Herman.

166
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,191
The trouble is, Edith,
you still think of home

167
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,193
as though it
was still there.

168
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:55,715
Germany is not there anymore,
if you see what I mean.

169
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,683
It was already not there
when we had to run away from it.

170
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,305
We're all homesick.

171
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,068
I think perhaps Edith,
just a little bit more.

172
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,587
To be realistic,

173
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:10,315
I must agree with Petronella,
home is gone.

174
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,904
No.

175
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,354
It followed us the other day.

176
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:22,155
Well, then, here's something
we can all agree on, I think.

177
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:24,985
To the Germany that was.

178
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,849
<i>Proest.</i>

179
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,767
Come, Pet, let's dance.

180
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,635
Sweeping me off my feet.

181
00:12:56,672 --> 00:13:00,503
You're still light
on your feet, Pet.

182
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:04,335
Miep, I have some news
for the two of you.

183
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,924
In respect to your
search for a flat.

184
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,857
Which has grown rather
desperate of late,

185
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,341
in fact.

186
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,377
There seems to be not so much
as a cupboard to be found

187
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,723
in all Amsterdam.

188
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:16,312
I think I've managed more
than a cupboard for you.

189
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,383
We have a friend,
Mrs. Sampson,

190
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:20,696
quite near by in the
Rainer Strasse.

191
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,906
She lives alone, but in the
recent situation,

192
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:27,427
she has become quite fearful
of being on her own.

193
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,395
As it happens,
she has two rooms rarely used.

194
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,330
She has decided to make
them available to let.

195
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:37,299
I've spoken to her about you
and the rooms are yours

196
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,818
if you want them.

197
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,336
If we want them?

198
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:45,721
Oh, Mr. Frank,
how can we thank you?

199
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,274
This is wonderful news.

200
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,035
Hello, Miep.

201
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,864
Hello, Mr. Gies.

202
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,693
Margot, where have
been keeping yourself?

203
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,902
In the kitchen.

204
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:56,870
I thought you went
to the cinema or something.

205
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,665
And where is your sister?

206
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:00,184
Sulking in the kitchen.

207
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,876
Why is she sulking, darling?

208
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,292
Because I beat her again
of course, Father.

209
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:06,535
At what?

210
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,575
I've only played this once
or twice before.

211
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,888
I'm not very good.

212
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,822
Have you seen the new
American film, Miep?

213
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,341
Not yet.
What is it?

214
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,826
"The Philadelphia Story,"

215
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,071
starring Katherine Hepburn
and Cary Grant.

216
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:28,005
I think Katherine Hepburn
is fabulous.

217
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,491
I think I like her even
better than Carole Lombard,

218
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,562
although it's
a difficult choice.

219
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,391
I think it would be wonderful

220
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,773
to be either one
of them, don't you?

221
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:41,363
Cary Grant is a different
story, of course.

222
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:44,607
There's no question in my mind,
when it comes to Cary Grant--

223
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:47,541
I think Cary Grant
is the most

224
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:51,200
terrifically handsome man
in the entire world!

225
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:53,271
Well, except for Daddy.

226
00:14:56,516 --> 00:15:00,140
Are you afraid
of the Germans, Miep?

227
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:02,867
I try not to be.

228
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,006
But are you?

229
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:17,019
So, we only have to go down
there and give them this

230
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:19,297
information they
want to have.

231
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:21,437
It's a kind
of registration.

232
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:23,439
For everyone?

233
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:26,408
No, only
the Jewish people.

234
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:27,788
But why?

235
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,691
It's the policy of the Germans
in occupied countries.

236
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:39,317
It's nothing
to be worried about.

237
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:41,319
A formality, that's all.

238
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:42,631
But why would they
want our names

239
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:45,599
and where we live and what
adults do in their professions?

240
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:48,913
They are a very bureaucratic
sort, the Germans.

241
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,191
They like to have
everything on record.

242
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:54,401
They are very fond of paperwork,
four copies of everything.

243
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:57,577
It will be a wonder if they
don't smother themselves

244
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,337
to death in their
own paperwork

245
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:03,307
long before the Allies
beat them.

246
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:07,449
But mostly it has something to
do with their not liking us,

247
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:08,691
isn't that so, Daddy?

248
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:14,732
♪♪

249
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:18,253
All right.

250
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,466
Go to the end
of the line.

251
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,951
Next.

252
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,787
Next.

253
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:39,377
How many?

254
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,435
Now you sit down.

255
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,258
Next one.

256
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:40,266
Next.

257
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,188
Next one.

258
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:07,845
Next.

259
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,987
Sit down.

260
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,816
Sit straight.
Look into the camera.

261
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,234
Sit higher.
Look here.

262
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,587
Wait!

263
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,554
Wait.

264
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,940
Otto.

265
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,907
Morning, Herman.
How are you feeling?

266
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,909
Not altogether up to snuff.

267
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,704
I didn't want to stand
another day.

268
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:43,467
I know you can't get along
without me.

269
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,848
Carl called me at home
yesterday.

270
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:47,850
I didn't like at all what
he had to tell me.

271
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,300
Oh?
What was that?

272
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:52,545
That we have to register with
the Germans as a Jewish firm.

273
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:55,237
Gies and Company is as
German as sauerkraut.

274
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:59,379
All businesses run by Jews
must register.

275
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:03,763
All businesses with one or more
Jewish partners must register.

276
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:07,560
All businesses with a subsidiary
firm or regional office,

277
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:11,564
of which a Jew is a director,
must register.

278
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:13,635
I don't like this, Otto.

279
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,947
They are going to close
us down, do you think?

280
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:19,296
I don't like to think too much
about the future, Herman.

281
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,884
Did you see? Look.

282
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
Every radio in Amsterdam

283
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:25,164
has to be registered with
the police.

284
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,167
What the hell is that
all about?

285
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:39,212
What's the matter, sweetheart?

286
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,869
I've received a letter

287
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:43,043
to appear at the German
Consulate, Mrs. Sampson.

288
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,045
What about?

289
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,219
It doesn't say.

290
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:49,360
It just says to appear before
the 22nd of October.

291
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:52,121
That's tomorrow.

292
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:29,400
According to our information,

293
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:32,679
you recently were afforded the
opportunity of membership

294
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:36,407
in the German Girls Association
of the Netherlands.

295
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:39,479
An opportunity that
you chose to decline.

296
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:40,515
Is this correct?

297
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,795
They invalidated my passport.

298
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,831
They say I have to leave Holland
within 90 days.

299
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,247
They say I have to go back
 to Austria.

300
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,041
For how long?
Permanently.

301
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:51,940
They're deporting me
permanently.

302
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,942
What are you saying? Why?
What's happened?

303
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:57,186
Do you remember that stupid
fascist club I refused to join?

304
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,050
For that?
For that.

305
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:02,951
There's absolutely
no possibility of
a compromise of some sort?

306
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:05,954
He called me an
undesirable alien.

307
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:08,128
A Nazi sitting at a Nazi desk

308
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:10,130
in a country occupied
by the Nazis,

309
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:13,272
and he called me an
undesirable alien.

310
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,998
Compromise?
What could I have said?

311
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,691
That I would join his
rotten little ladies club

312
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:21,141
if he would let me
stay in my own country?

313
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:22,798
No, no, you could hardly have
said that.

314
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,248
Alien?

315
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,940
I'm as Dutch as anybody born in
any building on this street.

316
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,770
In your heart.Where it matters.

317
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:31,117
Not to them.

318
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,739
I could kick myself
around the block

319
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:34,879
for never having become
a legal citizen.

320
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,847
What am I going to do?

321
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:42,508
You're going to become
a legal citizen.

322
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,855
How?

323
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,581
By marrying a Dutchman.

324
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:48,824
If you marry a Dutchman,
you'll be Dutch.

325
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:51,068
They couldn't touch you.

326
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,036
All you need to do is
find a handsome,

327
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,487
intelligent, charming
gentlemen of Dutch birth,

328
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:59,490
sound of mind and body
and financially solvent,

329
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:03,080
and with a fairly promising
future in his chosen profession.

330
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,462
Offering you
comfort and security

331
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:08,154
in your twilight years.

332
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:11,606
May I suggest
such a gentlemen?

333
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,611
On all the occasions
we discussed

334
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:20,028
the possibility of marriage,
I never imagined

335
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:22,962
that the actual proposal would
be quite like this.

336
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,964
I might have done it in
a more conventional way,

337
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:27,380
but this was so much more
interesting, don't you think?

338
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,624
That's true.

339
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,315
Do it in a conventional way.

340
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:41,532
Will you marry me, my love?

341
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,294
Yes.

342
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,417
Jan, Miep!

343
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:07,972
Come on! Please!

344
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:10,665
Please. Yes, yes.

345
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:20,088
Mrs. Frank, please!
This way now!

346
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:22,987
Smile, everyone.

347
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:25,921
Thank you.

348
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:28,441
Go on, you'll be late.

349
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:30,685
You'll miss your train!

350
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,605
It begins.

351
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:32,125
It always begins,
everywhere the Germans go.

352
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,231
Do they know how many
were taken?

353
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,129
They estimate 400.

354
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:39,719
They have been taken to some
sort of detention camp.

355
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,308
They won't be there for long,
you'll see.

356
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:44,931
They'll disappear.

357
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:48,935
To where, not even
the resistance will know.

358
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,528
It always begins.

359
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:03,122
Oh.

360
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:04,123
Shhh.

361
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:09,300
<i>This is Radio Orange,</i>

<i> Good luck and God be with you,</i><i>

376
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:54,242
But you understand,

377
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,831
the strikers
knew what would happen

378
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,902
and still
it didn't stop them

379
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:00,835
from doing
what they wanted to do,

380
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:03,458
to show us we have friends,

381
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:06,668
to show us
their hearts.

382
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:10,638
Nor did it stop the Germans from
showing us theirs today.

383
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:13,157
What do you mean, Mama?

384
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:15,263
The fact is...

385
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:19,163
they issued some rather
unfortunate rules today, girls.

386
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:21,027
What kind of rules?

387
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:24,583
Well, we won't be permitted to
stay in hotels anymore,

388
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:28,552
or patronize cafes or
restaurants or cinemas.

389
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:34,351
Libraries and public parks will
also be out of bounds for us,

390
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,216
I'm sorry to say.

391
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,288
But never you mind.

392
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:43,015
You'll be amazed how much you
can learn to do without

393
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,499
if you really have to.

394
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:49,435
Meanwhile, there's one law they
can't stop us from breaking.

395
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:52,541
And I see it's time
to break it.

396
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:01,792
Germans are trying
to jam it again.

397
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:04,346
What would the Nazis really do
if they caught us

398
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,728
listening to radio or enjoying
the BBC, Daddy?

399
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,455
Ah, but they can't catch us,
can they?

400
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,802
How can they possibly know which
Jewish people

401
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:15,288
are listening to
the radio and which aren't?

402
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:18,740
There's nothing they can do
about it.

403
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,746
Come on.

404
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,583
I don't know if the Americans
being in the war

405
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:10,619
will be of much
help to us, Miep.

406
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:13,174
Of course it will, Mrs. Samson,
absolutely.

407
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,003
They have to fight
the Japanese.

408
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:17,730
How much will will they
be able to fight the Germans?

409
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:20,457
They're only in North Africa,
not even in Europe yet.

410
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,737
America is a huge country with
many men for fighting.

411
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,155
We only have to be patient.

412
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,476
Oh, marvelous.

413
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,719
Absolutely.

414
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,755
Will you dare to do that?

415
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,757
If the Nazi's want to put
yellow stars on the Jews,

416
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,863
we'll show them plenty
of yellow.

417
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,612
You got to hand it
to these Dutch,

418
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:14,649
they've got guts.

419
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:17,238
According to Radio Orange,
the Dutch and the Danes

420
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:19,033
are the only people
in occupied Europe

421
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:21,621
who have the nerve to stand up
to Germans in ways like this.

422
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:24,038
Did you hear that?
It takes guts.

423
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:26,178
They're going to speak to me
today, Herman.

424
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:27,455
Today?

425
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:30,423
I think it's time,
do you agree?

426
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,840
Yes, yes, I agree.

427
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,811
Miep, I have a secret
to confide to you.

428
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:42,332
You know, of course, that there
are Jews here in Amsterdam,

429
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,437
and elsewhere surely,

430
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:46,094
who have gone
into hiding?

431
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:48,234
Yes.

432
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:50,685
Mrs. Frank and I
have decided to take
that course of action.

433
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:53,999
We are going to hide in with
Margot and Anne.

434
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:57,002
Mr. Van Daan and wife and son
will join us.

435
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:59,211
Yes, I see.

436
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:02,179
As for the business,
Mr. Koophuis and Mr. Kraler

437
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:05,907
will be able to keep
things going.

438
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:08,668
And I will be available
for consultation.

439
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:18,851
Look, would you be willing...

440
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:22,475
to help take care of us...

441
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,029
while we're in hiding?

442
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:26,169
Absolutely.

443
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:30,863
Don't answer
too quickly, Miep.

444
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:32,554
You know the punishment
for those

445
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,625
who help the Jews
is harsh.

446
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,283
Imprisonment certainly
sometimes.

447
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:40,045
We needn't discuss that
any further, Mr. Frank.

448
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,049
Just tell me
what you want me to do.

449
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,886
Miep, I wondered if you
would get you coat

450
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,784
and come with me,
would you?

451
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,201
Now?
Why not?

452
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,444
A bit of a break from all this
routine tragedy

453
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,861
will do you good,
come on.

454
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,006
This is it.

455
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,180
There you are, madam.

456
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,458
Good day, Mr. Hendriks,
see you next week.

457
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:21,120
Ah, how are you, Van Daan?

458
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:23,122
I could complain,
but why bother?

459
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:25,573
Give me half pound of this.

460
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:28,093
Such as it is.

461
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,062
Allow me to introduce
my friend, Mrs. Gies.

462
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,108
You're looking quite fit,
Van Daan.

463
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:45,593
It's all these miles
of walking lately.

464
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:48,182
You Protestants don't know
what you're missing
of the benefits.

465
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:50,080
Not allowing the Jews in
the streetcars anymore

466
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,530
and taking away
our bicycles

467
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:53,118
is the best thing the
Krauts have did for us

468
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,327
by way of our health.

469
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,845
Mustn't let them know,
however,

470
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,848
or they'll have us back on
the streetcars in nothing flat.

471
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:07,235
Well, back to the office
for us.

472
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,928
Mr. Van Daan, I don't
understand why you wanted me--

473
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,378
Miep, look at
it this way.

474
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:16,037
In this life, it never hurts
to know an honest butcher.

475
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:24,770
Hello?

476
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:28,981
What's the matter, dearest?

477
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,639
What is it?

478
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:35,263
Calm down.
Calm down, Edith.

479
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:37,817
Tell me what's happened.

480
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:40,027
It was so good of you to come.

481
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,926
We do not allow callers so late
in the evening,

482
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,307
but the fact is--

483
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:48,587
The fact is Margot...

484
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,487
received a summons today to
report for transit

485
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:54,351
to a labor camp in Germany.

486
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:57,216
Oh, my God. When?

487
00:32:57,251 --> 00:33:00,150
Tomorrow.

488
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,670
Now, we--But she's only 16 years old.

489
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:04,465
It doesn't matter to them,
it doesn't matter.

490
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,777
Is there anything that
can be done, Mr. Frank?

491
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:10,160
Yes. We aren't as prepared as we
would like to be, of course,

492
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:14,475
but this development
makes it necessary

493
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:17,029
for us to go into
hiding immediately.

494
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,341
Do you see?

495
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,618
Tonight?

496
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,208
Tomorrow morning.

497
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:25,658
Are you still willing to help
us, Miep?

498
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:27,591
What do you want me to do?

499
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:29,731
We still have one bicycle.

500
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,148
I held it back when we were
required to turn them in.

501
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:35,737
Margot will use that if you will
take her to the hiding place.

502
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,291
It would be faster.

503
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:39,396
It is an hour's walk from here
to the office.

504
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:42,779
She won't wear her star.

505
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,057
We will follow along
right after.

506
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:49,406
You understand
the situation, Miep?

507
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:52,720
You will be with a Jew

508
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:56,034
who is riding
an illegal bicycle

509
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,864
and is without her star.

510
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,060
Go, go.

511
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:49,639
Uhh!

512
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:37,307
Is this it?
The attic?

513
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:39,723
Yes. You go on up.
I'll be up again later.

514
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:41,208
Stay away from the windows.

515
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,141
Don't make any noise.
Do you understand?

516
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,591
The office will be
opening soon.

517
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:48,594
Father has explained
everything.

518
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:50,596
Couldn't I wait down there
for them to come?

519
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:52,529
No, it wouldn't be safe.

520
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:55,498
They'll be along very soon.

521
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,954
Gies and Company.
May I help you?

522
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:42,096
Yes.

523
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,548
Oh, yes, it was sent
this morning.

524
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:47,135
Not at all.

525
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,551
Good-bye.

526
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,697
Thank you, Miep.

527
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,671
Welcome.

528
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:23,301
Have you had any luck in regard
to the ration books?

529
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,649
Jan has contacted his friends
in the underground.

530
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:28,961
They will provide us with
forged ration books

531
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:30,204
for all of you.

532
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:31,861
No questions asked, of course.

533
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,138
That's excellent.

534
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:35,382
Now, what about my cigarettes?

535
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:38,592
Have you had the chance to
go by our flat, Miep?

536
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:41,974
I passed by there yesterday,
Mrs. Van Daan.

537
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:43,528
I'm sorry to have to tell you

538
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:46,220
it appears...
they have emptied it out.

539
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:48,429
Oh, well.

540
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:50,224
Oh.

541
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,709
All of our lovely furniture.

542
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:55,125
All our pretty things.

543
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,681
All gone.

544
00:38:58,715 --> 00:38:59,992
All gone!

545
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:01,684
No, no, no, no.
There, there, there.

546
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:03,306
It's, it's all to the good.

547
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,790
It's a good sign.

548
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,447
It means they've given up
on our returning.

549
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:09,381
They know we've disappeared
for certain.

550
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,349
They'll forget all about us.

551
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,351
You could have hardly
expected to go back

552
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,974
when this is all over
and find things
as they were, Petronella.

553
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,666
You are not being realistic.

554
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:26,087
Here is our
shopping list, Miep.

555
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:29,367
Just do what you can.

556
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,197
Everything is in good order
here, Koophuis.

557
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,301
Thank you.

558
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:37,823
Well, it's back
to work for me.

559
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,411
Mr. Frank, the shopping list,

560
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:41,620
I think we'll be able to
manage most of it,

561
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:43,519
but I'm afraid our
ration coupons

562
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:46,142
simply won't
provide us much meat.

563
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,594
I believe Mr. Van Daan
has seen to that.

564
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:51,250
Ah. You may recall, Miep,

565
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:53,114
our little
walk we took together

566
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:56,152
a couple months ago for
a bit of shopping.

567
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,844
May I presume that
a certain butcher

568
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:02,261
will be quite cooperative
by way of ration coupons?

569
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:06,542
It never hurts to know
an honest butcher.

570
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:16,241
May I help you, please?

571
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,212
I'm not quite sure
what I need.

572
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:23,800
Why don't you wait on this
gentlemen?

573
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,043
Sir?

574
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:27,390
See if you can find me
six pork chops.

575
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,463
If there was some meat on them,
that would help.

576
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:34,397
I can't believe it.

577
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,813
I seem to have lost my list.
I'll be back later.

578
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:37,987
As you wish, ma'am.

579
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:47,237
I found it.

580
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:12,746
<i> ...continued his pursuit in</i><i> North Africa</i>

581
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,333
<i>of Rommel's shattered army.</i>

582
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:15,990
<i>British columns</i><i>
were said to be</i>

583
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:19,615
<i>200 miles west of El Alamein,</i><i>
close to the Libyan border.</i>

584
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:21,202
<i>The United States Navy</i><i>
announced</i>

585
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:23,273
<i>that army forces on</i><i>
Guadalcanal Island</i>

586
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:26,691
<i>have attacked Japanese troops</i><i>
to the east of the airfield.</i>

587
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:27,830
<i>It was also...</i>

588
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,758
Are you certain
it was the man you knew?

589
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,864
Don't I know Mr. Blumberg
when I see him?

590
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:03,969
He is walking the streets,
before the war,

591
00:42:04,004 --> 00:42:05,384
and suddenly one day,
he's gone.

592
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:06,834
Certainly it was him.

593
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:09,492
All this time hiding with
Mr. and Mrs. Fontaine.

594
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,700
They were betrayed,
you know.

595
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:12,322
They must have been betrayed.

596
00:42:12,357 --> 00:42:15,809
Yes, possibly,
or they became careless.

597
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:17,949
I don't think so.

598
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,227
Not Mr. Fontaine,
he's too clever.

599
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:22,160
He's a very clever man.

600
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:24,852
He's a professor
at the university.

601
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:27,234
No, they were betrayed.

602
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:30,548
I just know it in my bones.

603
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:33,412
For five guilders.

604
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:36,484
That's what Germans
are paying for Jews
in hiding now, you know.

605
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:39,142
Five guilders.

606
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:42,490
Well...

607
00:42:42,525 --> 00:42:45,114
at least I'll know
what I'm worth, Miep.

608
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,598
What do you mean?

609
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:50,533
I've made my decision, Miep.
I'm going into hiding.

610
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,674
You and Jan can
stay on here, of course.

611
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:56,919
In fact, I'll be thankful
for it.

612
00:42:56,953 --> 00:43:00,129
If the flat was left unoccupied,
you know what would happen.

613
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,545
In no time, there would be
a van out there

614
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,202
being filled with all
my possessions.

615
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:07,170
Then I would come back
to nothing.

616
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:09,690
Assuming, of course,
that I come back.

617
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,833
Dinner offered by
the Secret Annex

618
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,973
on the occasion
of the anniversary

619
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:21,391
of the marriage of
Mr. and Mrs. Gies, Esquire.

620
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,466
To begin, bullion a la Miep,

621
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:31,194
followed by roast beef Hendriks,
medium rare.

622
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:34,646
After which there
will be salad riche onion,

623
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:37,200
salad Hollandaise and one
potato.

624
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,032
And finally, sugar cinnamon.

625
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:42,412
Cinnamon.

626
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:44,656
And raspberry juice
to be served

627
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,452
with coffee, cream and various
desert surprises.

628
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:49,212
Voila!

629
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:54,321
I want you to have this as a
keepsake

630
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:56,081
of this special
occasion.

631
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:58,670
We'll keep it always.
I promise.

632
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,396
Maybe on your next
anniversary,

633
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,606
you might consider inviting us
to your home.

634
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,918
Consider it done.

635
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:06,574
We'll be there.

636
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,685
Oh!

637
00:44:15,307 --> 00:44:17,965
I haven't seen a cake like that
since we left home.

638
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,175
The icing is a specialty of
Margot's.

639
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,214
What do you think of
the situation in Stalingrad,
Mr. Gies?

640
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:26,802
It seems to me as though
the Russians

641
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:28,493
are making a terrific fight
of it, Peter.

642
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,702
You can bet the crowds in
Stalingrad

643
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:33,256
would rather be in North Africa
fighting the Americans.

644
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,292
At least it's war.

645
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,227
How far is it from North Africa
to Italy, Papa?

646
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:40,091
Oh, not far, darling.

647
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,782
A skip and a jump.

648
00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:43,335
The Allies will be
invading Italy

649
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,268
within six months,
mark my words.

650
00:44:45,303 --> 00:44:48,237
Well, it still seems to me
that the best news

651
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:49,928
is what Miep has
told us,

652
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:52,620
and much closer to home,
that the round-ups have stopped.

653
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:54,830
It's been weeks and weeks
since the last one.

654
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:57,764
Maybe they are only making room
in the death camps for more.

655
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:06,876
Well, Miep, Jan, you might be
interested to know

656
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:10,535
that while we rely on you for
events on the outside,

657
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:13,572
Anne is keeping track
of all the news in here.

658
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:16,265
Such as it is.

659
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,508
Writing it all down
in your little book,

660
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:20,027
aren't you, darling?

661
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:22,478
Yes. It seems we have a writer
in the family.

662
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:26,171
Revealing all of our darkest
secrets, no doubt.

663
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:29,830
Scribble, scribble, scribble.

664
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:31,211
Anne doesn't scribble.

665
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,454
There are no dark secrets.

666
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:36,043
And even if there was, I
certainly wouldn't reveal them.

667
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:39,150
It's a strictly private matter
between me and myself.

668
00:45:39,184 --> 00:45:41,462
May I please be excused, Daddy?

669
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:49,022
Anne can sometimes be
awfully sensitive.

670
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:50,748
That's more than could be said
for some people.

671
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,475
More coffee, Jan?

672
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:07,385
May I come in?

673
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:11,389
Yes, of course.

674
00:46:19,638 --> 00:46:21,813
I'm sorry I was so rude,

675
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:25,196
but really, sometimes...

676
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,371
Well, how can a person expect
to remain calm and polite

677
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:31,961
all the time in a situation
that's so completely...

678
00:46:31,996 --> 00:46:34,412
not normal?

679
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:37,829
Can you imagine having to sit
in one place all day, every day

680
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:40,556
without moving unless it's
absolutely necessary

681
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,627
from morning to night?

682
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:46,320
I don't know what
I would do if it wasn't for
you and Jan and the others.

683
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:51,601
There's just no telling how long
it's going to last, is there?

684
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,983
That's the worst part of it,
I suppose.

685
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:55,985
Not knowing
when it will be over

686
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,781
and when we can go
back to our normal lives.

687
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:08,308
I know it isn't the same

688
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:11,069
as being locked away in hiding
as you all are.

689
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:17,489
But the way I try to think
of the occupation

690
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:23,185
is that every day that passes
is one day less of it.

691
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:26,844
Sometimes it helps
to think of it that way.

692
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:30,917
Yes.

693
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:36,888
I see what you mean.

694
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:38,096
I'll try to do that.

695
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:46,691
In the meantime,

696
00:47:46,725 --> 00:47:50,419
do you know what
I would adore to happen?

697
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:52,628
What?

698
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,803
I would adore it
if you and Jan

699
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,220
could come and spend the night
here with us here one night.

700
00:47:58,254 --> 00:48:02,396
Oh. Well, I'm not quite sure

701
00:48:02,431 --> 00:48:04,536
that would be convenient
for everyone.

702
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:07,574
Oh, it would be
no trouble at all.

703
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:09,887
Look, you could stay here
in our room,

704
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:11,958
and Margot and I could sleep
in Mommy and Daddy's room.

705
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:13,580
It would be no trouble.

706
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:15,168
I'll ask Daddy.

707
00:48:15,202 --> 00:48:17,377
If he says yes, will you?

708
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,103
Will you stay the night
with us, Miep?

709
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:22,071
Well, if it's all right with
the others, we'd be delighted.

710
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:23,935
Oh, that would be wonderful.

711
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,937
I know he'll say yes.

712
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:28,077
I'll wait until tomorrow
to ask him, though.

713
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:29,941
He's probably not too pleased
with me just now

714
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:31,874
for being so rude
to Mrs. Van Daan.

715
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,565
Oh...

716
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:40,469
I wonder, could you do
something for me, Miep?

717
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,298
Whatever I can.

718
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,300
Could you bring me something
more to write in?

719
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:47,131
I'm running out of space
in my diary.

720
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:52,032
Daddy gave it to me on my last
birthday just before...

721
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:56,864
well, just before
we came here.

722
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:59,488
I'm sure I'll find you
something.

723
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:02,560
I kept a diary long ago
when I was about your age.

724
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:05,528
Do you have it still?No, I threw it away.

725
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:08,635
Oh, you should have
kept it, for always.

726
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:11,155
Sometimes I wish I had.

727
00:49:11,189 --> 00:49:15,366
It might be amusing to know what
kind of girl I was then.

728
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,126
Exactly.

729
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:19,957
I'm keeping mine for always.

730
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:50,504
Okay, pull.

731
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,664
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

732
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:17,980
It could have been suicide,
of course,

733
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,087
but more likely the poor
fellow simply died in hiding

734
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,330
and had to be disposed of
by his protectors.

735
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:25,436
Rinse.

736
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:34,548
I have decided I must go into
hiding, Miep.

737
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,241
Mrs. Dussel and I have
discussed the possibility

738
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:40,209
and decided it would
be for the best that
I find a safe address.

739
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,901
Only you?My wife is a Lutheran.

740
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:44,765
Oh, yes, of course,
I had forgotten.

741
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,320
She wants to go with me,
but I have insisted.

742
00:50:47,354 --> 00:50:49,115
Why should she
suffer for me in that way?

743
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:51,531
You wouldn't happen to know
of a safe address,

744
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:53,774
would you, Miep,
by any chance?

745
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,707
I only ask because I know
you and your husband

746
00:50:55,742 --> 00:50:58,193
have been good
friends to us.

747
00:50:58,227 --> 00:50:59,884
For all I know,
you may have helped

748
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:02,404
the Franks and the
Van Daans to escape.

749
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:03,991
Oh, my God.

750
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:06,856
How long has it been since they
all disappeared?

751
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:10,274
Six months?
More?

752
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:14,450
I only hope they are safe in
Switzerland someplace.

753
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:19,490
But I don't ask.
It's none of my business.

754
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:24,184
Well, if you hear of a place
that might be possible for me.

755
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,773
Open.

756
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:29,120
I don't know, Jan.

757
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:30,949
I'll have to think it over.

758
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:34,746
Of course, there would
have to be some discussion
with the others.

759
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:36,714
I understand.

760
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,406
Have you looked for other
possibilities?

761
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,201
Yes, we have.

762
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:43,134
To no avail so far.

763
00:51:43,169 --> 00:51:45,343
That's why we...

764
00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:47,932
decided to discuss
the possibility with you.

765
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:50,900
Of course you said nothing to
Dussel about us here.

766
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:53,179
Absolutely not.

767
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:56,561
Well, I hope you enjoyed your
stay at the hotel Secret Annex.

768
00:51:56,596 --> 00:51:59,323
If you are half as comfortable
as Anne is delighted,

769
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:00,876
you should have
a decent night of it.

770
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,120
After tonight, you will never
want to stay

771
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,743
in the hotels of
Europe again.

772
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:08,401
Good night.

773
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:09,919
Good night.Sleep well.

774
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:12,370
You took two.No, you took two.

775
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:14,890
No, you took two when
I put it down. It's my--

776
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:18,273
Everyone would have to agree
to it, of course.

777
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:21,759
But naturally, I wanted to
discuss it with you first.

778
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:25,383
If it comes to a vote,
mine will be yes.

779
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:28,283
How could we refuse, Otto?

780
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:32,425
It would be a strain
in every way.

781
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:34,220
Because that than the thought of
what might happen

782
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:37,050
if we were to turn him away.

783
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:41,192
As you say,
how can we refuse?

784
00:52:41,227 --> 00:52:43,298
We'll talk to others
in the morning.

785
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:45,162
Who can tell?

786
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:49,338
Another face might actually be
something of a relief.

787
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:52,065
God knows he's a far better
bridge player

788
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:54,032
than Petronella Van Daan.

789
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:18,229
Are you asleep?

790
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:20,818
Not yet.

791
00:53:20,852 --> 00:53:22,578
What are you thinking?

792
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:26,237
That in the morning,

793
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:29,551
we are free to leave here

794
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:31,518
and live our
normal lives.

795
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:36,937
For the first time,

796
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:40,320
I think I begin to know
just the littlest bit

797
00:53:40,355 --> 00:53:42,633
what it's like to be them.

798
00:55:11,135 --> 00:55:13,344
I don't know how to thank you.

799
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:14,483
Where is it to be?

800
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:17,417
We can't tell you, Doctor,
only--When?

801
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:19,350
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

802
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:20,593
That's impossible.

803
00:55:20,627 --> 00:55:22,733
Delay is dangerous.

804
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:24,182
If you begin to make
preparations,

805
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,701
you can't help it.

806
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:27,600
Someone else notices, who knows
who will become suspicious.

807
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:31,604
It's too dangerous.

808
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:35,366
Yes, all right,
whatever you say.

809
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:37,575
Will it be very far away
in the country?

810
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,163
Can you tell me that?

811
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:41,993
No, Doctor, we can't tell you.
I'm sorry.

812
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:44,341
Tell me what you can.

813
00:55:49,656 --> 00:55:55,248
Tomorrow morning at 7:00,
you go to this address.

814
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:57,457
Wait there on the street.

815
00:55:57,492 --> 00:55:59,045
Carry as little as possible.

816
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,599
Nothing that would make you
conspicuous.

817
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:04,706
The best way is to wear several
layers of clothing.

818
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,571
That's the usual thing,
but don't overdo it.

819
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:12,092
A man will approach you and say,
"Follow me, please."

820
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:14,957
That's all there is to it.

821
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:16,718
And don't wear your star.

822
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:18,685
But that is dangerous.

823
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,169
What if...

824
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:23,103
Yes.

825
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:25,968
Yes, I see what you mean.

826
00:57:06,768 --> 00:57:08,114
Follow me, please.

827
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:11,669
Quickly please, Doctor.

828
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:29,998
Good God, what the hell
is going on here?

829
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,206
Pardon my French.

830
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,828
Come and see, Doctor.

831
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:43,598
This is amazing.

832
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:45,220
I would never have dreamt it.

833
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:48,499
Welcome to the Secret Annex,
Dr. Dussel.

834
00:57:48,534 --> 00:57:49,983
Switzerland would have been
better, Doctor,

835
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:52,365
but we make the best of it.

836
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:56,611
Come on, come on, everybody,
breakfast is ready.

837
00:57:56,645 --> 00:57:59,027
If only I knew where he was,

838
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:01,650
it would help a little,
I think.

839
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:07,622
Secrets fly, Mrs. Dussel.

840
00:58:07,656 --> 00:58:10,763
Things are best left
as they are.

841
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:12,489
The fewer who know
will be safer.

842
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:14,525
What happens if they die?

843
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:18,702
Hmm?

844
00:58:18,736 --> 00:58:21,083
These people in hiding,

845
00:58:21,118 --> 00:58:23,569
what happens if they
become ill and die?

846
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,506
The Germans have increased
the reward for the Jews.

847
00:58:31,093 --> 00:58:34,718
It must be because there are
so few of them left.

848
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:37,306
Have you noticed?

849
00:58:37,341 --> 00:58:40,033
One doesn't see many Jews
about on the streets anymore.

850
00:58:40,068 --> 00:58:42,001
When it all began,

851
00:58:42,035 --> 00:58:45,314
I recall Albert telling me

852
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:49,284
there were 140,000 Jews
in Holland.

853
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,356
I wonder how many are left.

854
00:59:23,249 --> 00:59:24,699
What's happened?

855
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:27,184
Miep...

856
00:59:45,892 --> 00:59:47,618
Miep!

857
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,658
I told you it was going to be
all right, didn't I?

858
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:54,245
I knew it!
I told you!

859
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,662
It was only natural to think it
was the Germans down there.

860
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:59,009
I said it might only be
burglars. I was right.

861
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:02,219
Always helpful to have
an optimist around.

862
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:08,535
What happened?

863
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,503
Burglars.

864
01:00:10,537 --> 01:00:13,610
Well, Mr. Koophuis, that
was a close one, I'd say.

865
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:16,026
Obviously, we owe you
a special thanks

866
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,754
for the inspiration of
that bookcase.

867
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:21,618
Absolutely. Without that,
those hoodlums

868
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,136
would be through the door
in nothing flat,

869
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:24,897
turning us all in.

870
01:00:24,931 --> 01:00:26,174
What's the current
German price on us?

871
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,589
Still five guilders a piece?

872
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,797
That's assuming,
of course,

873
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:30,765
they didn't hear us
moving about up here.

874
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,594
If they did, they might
well be squawking

875
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,423
to the green police
this very minute.

876
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:37,357
So far, so good.

877
01:00:37,392 --> 01:00:40,637
Koophuis, when this ridiculous
nightmare is over,

878
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:42,362
I'll buy you the biggest
bottle of champagne

879
01:00:42,397 --> 01:00:43,950
to be found
in all of Amsterdam.

880
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:49,059
There's nothing original
about it at all.

881
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:52,200
It always happens in those, uh,
those spooky films.

882
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:55,824
The hidden door behind the
bookcase.

883
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:59,000
What was the name of that fellow
always in those films, Anne?

884
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:00,967
Bela Lugosi.

885
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:02,417
That's the fella.
The one with the cape.

886
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:05,972
Always the hidden door behind
the bookcase.

887
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:07,525
It was obvious.

888
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,803
In that case,
we should all

889
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:10,770
write a letter of thanks
to Mr. Lugosi.

890
01:01:10,805 --> 01:01:13,186
I'll sharpen his teeth
at no charge.

891
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:14,774
for the rest of his life.

892
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:01,096
What's the matter with you?

893
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,478
Are you totally crazy?

894
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:07,033
Can't you obey
the most simplest of rules?

895
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:09,380
Damn you all!

896
01:02:09,415 --> 01:02:13,453
You vile, rotten people!

897
01:02:13,488 --> 01:02:15,870
You think you own the world
and everyone in it!

898
01:02:15,904 --> 01:02:18,562
You don't own the world!
You'll never own it!

899
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:20,081
Never!

900
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:23,222
And every day you're losing
more of what you did!

901
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:24,602
And thank God for that!

902
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:27,260
Our day will come!

903
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:28,710
And when it does,

904
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,748
we'll make you pay for
everything!

905
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,922
For everything you've done!

906
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,088
Something terrible has happened.
Hendriks has been arrested.

907
01:03:03,676 --> 01:03:05,505
Hello, Mr. Dortmunn.

908
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,162
Hello, Mrs. Gies.

909
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:09,578
An arrest you say?

910
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:11,132
Not a friend of yours, I hope.

911
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:15,170
Well, no, he isn't
a friend exactly.

912
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:16,620
He was our...

913
01:03:16,654 --> 01:03:18,104
He was my butcher.

914
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:19,657
Butcher?

915
01:03:19,692 --> 01:03:22,143
Safe to guess what brought about
that arrest, then.

916
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,007
The black market, no doubt.

917
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:27,631
A Jew?

918
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:30,392
No, no, he isn't a Jew.

919
01:03:32,463 --> 01:03:34,120
There are some Christians
who are not

920
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:37,675
altogether kosher either, eh,
Kraler?

921
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:42,715
Better luck next time in your
choice of butcher.

922
01:03:42,749 --> 01:03:45,062
Heil Hitler.

923
01:03:45,097 --> 01:03:47,168
Have a safe journey,
Mr. Dortmunn.

924
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,308
Thank you.

925
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:51,275
He just dropped in
out of nowhere.

926
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,725
On his way back
to Germany,

927
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:54,175
visiting the branch offices

928
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:57,040
and complaining about the
quality of the product.

929
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:59,870
It was all I could do to refrain
from reminding him

930
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:01,734
that if they hadn't
started the war,

931
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:04,323
the quality of the product would
be as good as it ever was.

932
01:04:04,357 --> 01:04:06,981
I have to go sit down.
My knees are shaking.

933
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:19,027
Anne, I brought you
some more notebooks.

934
01:04:19,062 --> 01:04:22,203
Oh, thank you, Miep,
that's wonderful.

935
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:30,073
Miep?
Hmm?

936
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:34,387
What's your opinion on the
Americans invading Italy?

937
01:04:34,422 --> 01:04:38,012
Why didn't they invade France
as they've been promising

938
01:04:38,046 --> 01:04:39,496
is what I'd like to know.

939
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:41,532
Italy is so far away.

940
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:42,809
It will take them
an awfully long time

941
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:44,777
to get here from Italy,
don't you think?

942
01:04:47,538 --> 01:04:51,439
I have also brought you
a little gift.

943
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:54,304
I don't know if they will fit,
you're growing so fast.

944
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:56,582
Have you noticed?

945
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,377
I think Peter has.

946
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,172
Uh, shoes.

947
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:05,660
Only second-hand,
but I think pretty good.

948
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:14,496
Oh, Miep!

949
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:15,877
For me?

950
01:05:19,191 --> 01:05:21,987
Oh, they're beautiful!

951
01:05:22,021 --> 01:05:24,610
I've never had
high-heeled shoes.

952
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:26,681
Well, it's time you had.

953
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,786
Try them on.
See if they fit.

954
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:38,382
Oh!

955
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:40,453
I feel like I'm going to
fall on my face.

956
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:43,698
We all do at first.
You'll get used to it.

957
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:45,803
Walk.

958
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:06,686
Oh!

959
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,948
Only one bag per person.

960
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,778
It's hardly worth the waiting.

961
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,065
♪♪

962
01:08:40,495 --> 01:08:41,979
Hello.

963
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:44,016
Good morning, Mr. Koophuis.

964
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:47,330
What news?

965
01:08:49,642 --> 01:08:51,196
Oh, my God.

966
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:55,165
Is that true?
Are you certain?

967
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,410
Oh, my God.

968
01:08:58,444 --> 01:09:01,344
Yes, yes.

969
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:04,554
Thank you, Mr. Koophuis,
thank you.

970
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:09,041

Don't move.

992
01:11:39,847 --> 01:11:42,850
They say they can't find
the work order anywhere.

993
01:11:52,963 --> 01:11:56,553
Shall we discuss
your friends upstairs?

994
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:03,180
We must keep calm.

995
01:12:03,215 --> 01:12:05,079
They may only be
sniffing around.

996
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,081
I think they know.
I think they know.

997
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,083
Miep, the ration books.

998
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,016
Oh, my God.

999
01:12:12,742 --> 01:12:14,813
Jan, they're all here.

1000
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,573
Are they found?Not yet.

1001
01:12:16,608 --> 01:12:18,368
I think they know, Jan.

1002
01:12:18,403 --> 01:12:20,197
Don't let the police
find it.

1003
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:21,992
Take the ration books
out of here.

1004
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:23,408
Elli, go with Jan.

1005
01:12:23,442 --> 01:12:26,065
Yes, Elli, go with Jan.
Get a raincoat.

1006
01:12:40,977 --> 01:12:43,013
You.

1007
01:13:14,907 --> 01:13:16,599
Back already?

1008
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:18,635
You're working too hard, Jan.

1009
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,637
You should at least take your
full lunch time.

1010
01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:21,880
It doesn't take very long

1011
01:13:21,914 --> 01:13:24,089
to eat what little there is
these days, does it.

1012
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:26,643
No.
You can say that again.

1013
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:30,258
Papers.

1014
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,492
Born in Vienna.

1015
01:15:01,358 --> 01:15:03,533
I was born in Vienna, too.

1016
01:15:06,605 --> 01:15:08,918
You shame your German blood.

1017
01:15:08,952 --> 01:15:11,334
As you can see,
I am married to a Dutchman.

1018
01:15:11,368 --> 01:15:12,577
I am Dutch.

1019
01:15:12,611 --> 01:15:15,614
You are a German slut helping to
hide Jewish garbage.

1020
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:18,099
You betray the Fatherland,
you shame your people

1021
01:15:18,134 --> 01:15:19,307
and you shame me!

1022
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:29,317
I expect no more from this
Dutch trash! But you?

1023
01:15:29,352 --> 01:15:32,286
How dare you display
such contempt

1024
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,220
for one of the Furher's
greatest personal victories

1025
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:38,154
by harboring these specimens
of Jew filth!

1026
01:15:40,674 --> 01:15:43,400
I can't believe
you are so stupid

1027
01:15:43,435 --> 01:15:45,610
as not to have understood
the consequences

1028
01:15:45,644 --> 01:15:48,820
of your disgusting actions.

1029
01:15:48,854 --> 01:15:51,098
Are you prepared for them now?

1030
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:53,618
Are you prepared to share the
fate of your Jew friends?!

1031
01:15:53,652 --> 01:15:57,035
Or the punishment of
these Dutch Jew lovers?

1032
01:15:58,761 --> 01:16:03,144
You are a stupid,
stupid, woman.

1033
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:14,190
So...

1034
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:16,882
what am I going
to do with you?

1035
01:16:19,298 --> 01:16:21,542
Hmm?

1036
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:29,481
What am I going to do with you?

1037
01:16:31,414 --> 01:16:33,347
I tell you frankly
that only our common blood

1038
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:37,316
gives me the slightest
hesitation in that regard.

1039
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:42,080
You have that to thank and
nothing else for whatever

1040
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:47,603
shred of sympathy I might feel
for you at this moment.

1041
01:16:49,294 --> 01:16:51,952
That and nothing else,
you understand.

1042
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:56,232
Do you understand?

1043
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:01,030
I can only say that
I am prepared

1044
01:17:01,064 --> 01:17:03,860
for whatever
consequences there may be.

1045
01:17:53,738 --> 01:17:55,325
Ah!

1046
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,335
Everybody out!

1047
01:18:08,442 --> 01:18:10,824
Move! Move!

1048
01:22:32,809 --> 01:22:35,019
Maybe we can buy them back.

1049
01:22:35,053 --> 01:22:37,883
What?

1050
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:40,369
If we could get enough money
together...

1051
01:22:40,403 --> 01:22:41,818
we could take up
a collection.

1052
01:22:41,853 --> 01:22:44,649
There are plenty who
would contribute.

1053
01:22:44,683 --> 01:22:46,478
Maybe we could buy them back.

1054
01:22:46,513 --> 01:22:48,825
Darling--There have been rumors.

1055
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:51,069
You know as well as I do
that the Germans can

1056
01:22:51,104 --> 01:22:53,934
sometimes be approached now
that they are losing the war.

1057
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,487
You know as well as I,

1058
01:22:55,522 --> 01:22:59,871
after all these years,
the reliability of rumors.

1059
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,944
But maybe we could.

1060
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,602
Maybe we could buy them back.

1061
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,581
In respect to what?

1062
01:23:56,928 --> 01:23:59,103
To our friends.

1063
01:23:59,137 --> 01:24:01,277
How much money would it take
to free them?

1064
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:09,354
You think we're in the business
of selling Jews?

1065
01:24:11,287 --> 01:24:13,324
I thought that it might be
possible to appeal to you--

1066
01:24:13,358 --> 01:24:15,878
If we were in the business
of selling Jews,

1067
01:24:15,912 --> 01:24:18,122
we'd all be
millionaires now.

1068
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:24,093
In 30 seconds,

1069
01:24:24,128 --> 01:24:28,201
you will either be out on
the street on your way home,

1070
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:31,859
or you will be in transit
to the Amersfoort camp

1071
01:24:31,894 --> 01:24:33,896
to join your
Dutch friends.

1072
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:35,725
One or the other.

1073
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,453
I can promise you.

1074
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:03,684
I, uh, shall be brief.

1075
01:25:04,996 --> 01:25:09,587
The Germans have capitulated
unconditionally.

1076
01:25:09,621 --> 01:25:11,451
The war is over.

1077
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,408
Hello, Miep.

1078
01:26:32,497 --> 01:26:36,536
Of course, when we arrived at
Auschwitz,

1079
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:40,643
they separated the
men from the women.

1080
01:26:40,678 --> 01:26:44,889
This was standard procedure.

1081
01:26:44,923 --> 01:26:46,546
But there was
sometimes ways of

1082
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,237
keeping track of others
in the camp,

1083
01:26:48,272 --> 01:26:52,586
the usual grapevine sort
of thing.

1084
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:56,694
After some months,

1085
01:26:56,728 --> 01:26:59,869
October, I think.

1086
01:27:02,286 --> 01:27:05,910
Anne and Margot...

1087
01:27:05,944 --> 01:27:08,188
and Mrs. Van Daan

1088
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:12,054
were transferred to
Bergen-Belson.

1089
01:27:15,506 --> 01:27:17,749
Edith...

1090
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,926
I'm sorry to have to
tell you,

1091
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,791
Edith won't be coming back.

1092
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:30,314
She died in Auschwitz
infirmary

1093
01:27:30,348 --> 01:27:33,938
sometime during the winter.

1094
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,261
Van Daan, I saw
with my own eyes

1095
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:48,090
on his way to the gas chamber.

1096
01:27:48,124 --> 01:27:50,644
Oh, God.

1097
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:57,306
Just before the Russians
liberated the camp,

1098
01:27:57,341 --> 01:27:59,584
the Germans took a great many
of the younger,

1099
01:27:59,619 --> 01:28:04,140
stronger men with them
in their retreat.

1100
01:28:04,175 --> 01:28:06,764
Peter was one of those.

1101
01:28:10,008 --> 01:28:12,701
I don't know what
happened to him.

1102
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:17,878
Nor Dr. Dussel.

1103
01:28:17,913 --> 01:28:21,813
I lost track of him altogether,
I'm sorry to say.

1104
01:28:23,677 --> 01:28:26,887
And Mrs. Van Daan
and the girls?

1105
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:30,477
I have high hopes.

1106
01:28:30,512 --> 01:28:32,997
Bergen-Belson wasn't a death
camp, you see.

1107
01:28:33,031 --> 01:28:35,137
There were no gas chambers.

1108
01:28:35,171 --> 01:28:37,933
And I think especially Anne
and Margot,

1109
01:28:37,967 --> 01:28:40,591
they are young, stronger.

1110
01:28:42,903 --> 01:28:46,976
Anne will be 16 in just a
weeks time, you know?

1111
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:50,670
The 12th of June.

1112
01:28:50,704 --> 01:28:52,844
Yes...

1113
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:56,020
I have high hopes.

1114
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:03,786
This is terribly
kind of you, Miep.

1115
01:29:06,858 --> 01:29:09,896
I can't thank you enough.

1116
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:14,659
You are welcome to say here for
as long as you like, Mr. Frank.

1117
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:16,627
It would please us so very much

1118
01:29:16,661 --> 01:29:20,389
if you would consider this
your home until you can

1119
01:29:20,424 --> 01:29:23,219
make more comfortable
arrangements for yourself.

1120
01:29:23,254 --> 01:29:24,600
Well, then,

1121
01:29:24,635 --> 01:29:27,120
it would please me very much if
you would call me Otto.

1122
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:31,952
Oh, uh,
it's never seemed...

1123
01:29:31,987 --> 01:29:36,440
Well, of course, if you prefer
it. Of course, Mister---

1124
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:38,062
Uh, but only outside
of the office.

1125
01:29:38,096 --> 01:29:39,615
I think it would be
very awkward for me

1126
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:41,410
to be so informal
at the office.

1127
01:29:41,445 --> 01:29:43,792
If you insist.

1128
01:29:43,826 --> 01:29:45,621
Especially if there would
be no office

1129
01:29:45,656 --> 01:29:49,107
for me to come back to if
it were not for you.

1130
01:29:49,142 --> 01:29:52,110
Fortunately, after
Mr. Koophuis was released,

1131
01:29:52,145 --> 01:29:54,803
we're able to
keep on keeping on.

1132
01:29:54,837 --> 01:30:00,429
Such good news about him and
Kraler.

1133
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:03,294
I thought of them often

1134
01:30:03,328 --> 01:30:06,435
and prayed God they wouldn't be
severely punished.

1135
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,645
Yes.

1136
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,923
May I?
Thank you.

1137
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:14,995
Yes, fortunately, all our
prayers were answered,

1138
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,826
in that respect,
at least.

1139
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,449
Now, what about these people
you have spoken to

1140
01:30:20,484 --> 01:30:24,971
who are trying to relocate
prisoners from the camps?

1141
01:30:25,005 --> 01:30:27,594
When might you have some news of
Anne and Margot?

1142
01:30:27,629 --> 01:30:30,873
It's impossible to say.

1143
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:33,531
There are so many, Miep.

1144
01:30:36,707 --> 01:30:40,469
"Displaced persons"
they call us.

1145
01:30:40,504 --> 01:30:43,127
There are millions.

1146
01:30:43,161 --> 01:30:47,614
Isn't it astonishing?

1147
01:30:47,649 --> 01:30:50,203
Millions.

1148
01:30:57,106 --> 01:31:02,560
Just last week,
after Mr. Kraler came back,

1149
01:31:02,595 --> 01:31:07,703
we talked about that day for
the first time altogether.

1150
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:10,188
Mr. Kraler and Mr. Koophuis

1151
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:13,847
and Elli and Jan and I

1152
01:31:13,882 --> 01:31:15,573
about who might have done it.

1153
01:31:15,608 --> 01:31:19,853
Who might have been the one
who betrayed you.

1154
01:31:19,888 --> 01:31:24,893
But, of course, we could only
suspect and speculate.

1155
01:31:27,033 --> 01:31:28,552
I wonder if we'll ever know.

1156
01:31:28,586 --> 01:31:31,313
Do you want to, Miep?

1157
01:31:33,695 --> 01:31:34,903
Don't you?

1158
01:31:36,214 --> 01:31:38,458
No.

1159
01:31:40,218 --> 01:31:43,118
I don't ever want to know.

1160
01:31:51,885 --> 01:31:53,128
Come.

1161
01:31:55,717 --> 01:31:57,063
Good morning, Mr. Frank.

1162
01:31:57,097 --> 01:31:59,514
Good morning.

1163
01:31:59,548 --> 01:32:01,585
Your mail.
Thank you.

1164
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:09,109
Have you heard the news this
morning, sir, about this bomb?

1165
01:32:09,144 --> 01:32:11,111
Yes, I have.

1166
01:32:11,146 --> 01:32:13,148
It seems inconceivable.

1167
01:32:13,182 --> 01:32:16,254
Maybe it will end the war
over there.

1168
01:32:16,289 --> 01:32:18,878
Pray God.

1169
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,912
Mr. Frank?

1170
01:32:55,328 --> 01:32:57,295
Mr. Frank?

1171
01:32:59,677 --> 01:33:01,368
Otto?

1172
01:33:05,683 --> 01:33:07,512
Otto, are you all right?

1173
01:33:13,311 --> 01:33:17,902
Anne and Margot are...

1174
01:33:21,043 --> 01:33:24,391
...not coming back, Miep.

1175
01:34:21,794 --> 01:34:24,382
Excuse me, Otto.

1176
01:34:31,873 --> 01:34:34,599
I was saving this for Anne.

1177
01:36:12,836 --> 01:36:15,355
We were only a few
