1
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:48,526
I want you
to go out looking good,

2
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:51,399
Harry, one of a proud breed.

3
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,400
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,098
Remember you're a seller.

5
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,534
There's not just a
salesman in the world,

6
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:59,537
but the sellers,
they're a race apart.

7
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:00,973
Remember when they used
to come up and shove

8
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,888
it right in our pockets, Harry?

9
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,504
The last of the Champions.

10
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,377
Come here
and give me a kiss.

11
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,162
Wouldn't
let you see these before

12
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:18,252
with that bad ticker you have
got, but these are yours now,

13
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:20,428
mate.

14
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:24,780
Oh, these
are disgusting.

15
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,650
Mhm.

16
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,912
I'm a family man.

17
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,745
So that's the difference
between you and me, Harry.

18
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,573
Yeah?

19
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:38,010
You've wasted years in
here studying anatomy.

20
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,403
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,796
While I've been in
the library developing

22
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:41,884
the scam of the century.

23
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,146
Is it true, Cec?

24
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,016
It's all planned.

25
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,670
It's all on paper.

26
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,499
What good is it to me?

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,197
I'm just a poor
old man who's gonna

28
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,416
die in this stinking prison
because that rotten mongrel

29
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:55,245
of a governor won't give a
dying man a medical pardon.

30
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,641
You'll never see me again, pal.

31
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,511
That I'll do.

32
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:05,734
Are you coming
or staying, Harry?

33
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:06,778
Don't rush me.

34
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,779
It's a big thing leaving home.

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,129
Who's going home?

36
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:13,785
I'm gonna miss you, mate.

37
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,135
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

38
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:20,879
Cell by myself.

39
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:24,970
Come up here for me, Harry.

40
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:25,928
I'll have two for you.

41
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:46,644
Harry Reynolds, you
steal from a dying man!

42
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:50,039
Poor old Cec,
misses me already.

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,476
You thieving mongrel!

44
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,870
You've stolen my life's work!

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,088
Paranoid now, of course.

46
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,526
I'll
get you for this!

47
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:00,136
It's prime real estate.
If I sent to you an account--

48
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,659
- See you, Mick.
- See you, Harry.

49
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,922
--for the time that I've
spent seeing your client

50
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,141
in this human garbage dump--

51
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,144
--property
is not bullshit.

52
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:11,887
I have just seen your client,
and he will not be signing

53
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,932
the paper giving me control.

54
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:17,806
Does this jailbird think he's
going back to selling bonds?

55
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,938
A Montblanc, a
driver's license,

56
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,725
one snapshot female porn.

57
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,466
Oh, great.

58
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,946
Mate, I could not give a
stuff about his wife and kids.

59
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:31,776
I'm a real estate developer,
not a bloody registered charity.

60
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,300
All right, I'll tell him.

61
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,997
Mr. Bostock--

62
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:35,824
--charitable
act by a convicted criminal.

63
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,521
--taxi outside.

64
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:38,740
Look, I'll toss him a line
for a price, his signature

65
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,784
on the contract today.

66
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,569
Well, that's it, Harry.

67
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,745
I'm the only one
offering him money right now.

68
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,702
See you next time.

69
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,703
Maybe we'll share a cell.

70
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,708
No offense, just a joke, Tom.

71
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:51,796
There you go.

72
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,276
See you.

73
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,625
Hey, Harry, that's my
bloody name you signed.

74
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:55,670
That's my name.

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,498
It just looks like your name.

76
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:15,516
You for Bostock?

77
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:16,386
Yes.

78
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,609
Oh, Bostock, Charlie Sanville.

79
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,872
We met last year at a convention
at the Regent, I think it was.

80
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,656
Hey, listen.

81
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:26,483
There's been a bit of a mix
up with the taxis, your blokes

82
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:27,876
broken down.

83
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,399
I thought perhaps you'd
like to share mine.

84
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,748
Well, I need to get away
from that scum in there.

85
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,315
They should castrate
the whole lot of them.

86
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,229
You know what I mean?

87
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,935
I've been seeing
a client myself.

88
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,698
Don't worry about
this, I'll get it.

89
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:08,612
Why wouldn't you?

90
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,049
It's your cab.

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,703
Yeah, right.

92
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,706
Fair enough 'cause you'll
be paying for everything

93
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,273
else, Mr. Bostock.

94
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,798
My hand shakes
steady and my words are sweet,

95
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:24,280
and the whole world's
lying here at my feet.

96
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,456
Put your trust in me.

97
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,023
Oh!
Oh, sorry.

98
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,981
I rub my eyes--
- Cash or charge?

99
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,592
Charge.

100
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,159
--and I
catch my breath.

101
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,117
I'm almost choking on
the smell of success.

102
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:38,250
Put your trust in me.

103
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:41,123
Hey, put your trust in me.

104
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,211
Thank you, Mr. Bostock.

105
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,778
Thank you.

106
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,215
I get careless now and then.

107
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,655
31?

108
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,355
I won't
let you down again.

109
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,268
25.

110
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,535
I got x-ray eyes.

111
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,538
And with just one
look, I can read

112
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,018
your future like an open book.

113
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,893
Put your trust in me,
put your trust in me.

114
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,475
There you are, Mr. Bostock.

115
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:32,174
Portuguese, early 16 century.

116
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,741
That's the one.

117
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,005
My hand shakes
steady and my words are sweet,

118
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:40,617
and the whole world's
lying here at my feet.

119
00:06:40,748 --> 00:07:00,420
Put your trust in me,
put your trust in me.

120
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,706
Most of the travelers
don't come down here anymore.

121
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:26,663
What travelers?

122
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:27,708
You're a salesman, right?

123
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:28,709
Who's a salesman?

124
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,058
Have it your own way.

125
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:31,451
But I'm telling you
there's no money here.

126
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,843
No money?

127
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,062
The guts has fallen
out of the bloody place.

128
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:47,989
Why not?

129
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,472
How are you?

130
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,996
Great.

131
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,406
Can't seem to find
your reservation.

132
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,844
That's strange.

133
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,933
This is the Carinya
guesthouse, isn't it?

134
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,412
Yeah.

135
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,719
My office was supposed
to have made a booking.

136
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,113
I'll just have to see
what I can do for you.

137
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,070
Good on you.

138
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,551
I'll just have a wait.

139
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:30,945
Shit.

140
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,424
David!

141
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,469
Single or double?

142
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,079
Double.

143
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,386
Yeah, with a double bed.

144
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,909
You married?

145
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,520
No, but I've got
very long legs.

146
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,349
Double cost
more because of the mortgage.

147
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,916
I think maybe you ought
to get your old man.

148
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,439
The booking was
probably made with him.

149
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,529
It's a big mortgage, and
my father's in Brisbane

150
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,313
with his dye blonde trollop.

151
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,315
David, why don't
you answer me.

152
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,838
Mom said she had
a bum reduction job.

153
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,318
- Yeah?

154
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:57,928
Sorry, I was in the kitchen.

155
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,930
This man isn't married,
but he wants to double bed.

156
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:00,888
Is that OK?

157
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,237
Yes, that's OK.

158
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,281
And I'm sure he's not
interested in Miss

159
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,762
Brenda's little figure problem.

160
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:06,807
Lively one.

161
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,070
Uh, yes.

162
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,593
Well, you can have your
pick at the moment.

163
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,769
There's a nice double
overlooking the harborage.

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,079
Beautiful.

165
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,429
Not many views like
that were I'm from.

166
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,216
Washbasin, getting noise
from the pub at night,

167
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,044
dinner's at 6:00--
the locals insist.

168
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,176
You're American, right?

169
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,657
Uh-huh.

170
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,006
Long way from home?

171
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,704
No, this is my home.

172
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:35,749
Just you and your son, is it?

173
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,229
Yeah, just me and David.

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,405
The, uh, burnt steak is
at the pub across the road

175
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,233
if you get sick of my cooking.

176
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,453
I hope you don't mind
sharing a bathroom.

177
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,889
No, that's all right.

178
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,935
I've shared a bathroom
for the past five years.

179
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:51,329
Oh, so you were married.

180
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,767
No, we just lived together.

181
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,812
We never had any spark.

182
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,248
She's not my type physically.

183
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,034
You stayed
together for five years?

184
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,427
It's hard to get out.

185
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,341
I've been there.

186
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,874
I like him.

187
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,224
You don't know
anything about him.

188
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:18,226
But I think that you
should charm his sights.

189
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,146
David.

190
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:28,062
Mom, I'm not matchmaking.

191
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,063
Oh, yes you are.

192
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:32,544
- Am not.
- Am so.

193
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,415
Not.

194
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:34,851
Am so, am so.

195
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:38,289
Well, no one around
here is gonna ask you.

196
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,900
I don't want them to ask me.

197
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:51,651
HARRY REYNOLDS
Dear Cec,

198
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,740
I apologize for
stealing your research,

199
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,656
but with your bad ticker,
you might die in there.

200
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,570
And then the warden will
be down here in Beachport

201
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,921
making money off your hard work.

202
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,184
Better me than him.

203
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,403
If anything comes of it,
I'll send you a split.

204
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:06,927
Yeah, I'll bet.

205
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:09,059
Look at it
as a divorce settlement.

206
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,020
Your friend for life, or five
years max, whichever is longer,

207
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,804
Harry Reynolds.

208
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,423
Mr. Reynolds, I
thought you'd like

209
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,121
someone to show you around.

210
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,818
I could give you
the $7 guided tour

211
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,777
of Beachport for only $6.30.

212
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:31,908
That's 10% off.

213
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,083
How old are you, mate?

214
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,694
10.

215
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,391
So.

216
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,045
Mr. Foster thinks there's an
old Portuguese treasure ship

217
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,742
buried in the sand dunes, hey?

218
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,092
Everyone around town reckons
Mr. Foster is a fruitcake.

219
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,398
Good day, Mr. Lewis.
- How are you?

220
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:44,312
Morning.

221
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,228
In here.

222
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,552
What a wonderful place.

223
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,340
Wonderful.

224
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,213
1530 Portuguese galleon,
three masks, two taser guns

225
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,694
carried broadside,
treasure ship.

226
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,570
Saint Sebastian, wrecked.

227
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,398
Of the Azores.

228
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,749
Harry, come here.

229
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,359
Do you have him?

230
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:37,626
It's, um,
autographed by the author, me.

231
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,193
That's you all right.

232
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,107
Great photo.

233
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,286
NORMAN FOSTER More
astonishing than fiction,

234
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,332
the legendary dune
ship is a vital part

235
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,551
of the history on which--

236
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,335
It's on special.

237
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,033
Already got one.
Harry.

238
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,599
NORMAN FOSTER --will
pose no harm [inaudible]..

239
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,862
You a local, are you?

240
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,820
No, my dad was.

243

What do we got here?

244
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,956
NORMAN FOSTER [ON

245
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:06,742
of the Australian
coastline 250 years

before Captain Cook
claimed Australia

247
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,965
for the British Empire.

248
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:16,447
Relics found on the sand
dunes near Beachport,

249
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:20,321
uh, prove the theory
that a Portuguese galleon

250
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:25,021
was wrecked here in the 1520s.

251
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:29,199
People have, uh, actually
seen the remains of the ship,

252
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,462
uh, in 1883.

253
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,117
And in 1953, uh,
another interesting

254
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,164
observation by a champ
who was unfortunately

255
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:40,428
intoxicated at the time.

256
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:44,693
Where did you get that?

257
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,650
What?

258
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,043
The Portuguese doubloon.

259
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,219
Oh, that?

260
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,700
That's just an old
coin of my father's

261
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,397
Well, where
did your father get it?

262
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,225
The sand.

263
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,618
Your name is, uh--

264
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,054
Reynolds, Harry Reynolds.

265
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,143
Reynolds, Reynolds.

266
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,667
You said your father
came from around here.

267
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:03,755
Did I say that?

268
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,844
Oh, yes, you did.

269
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:05,845
Did I?

270
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,107
Did your father find that--

271
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,021
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:08,978
I'm very sorry.

273
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,371
It's too premature.

274
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:11,720
I can't really talk
about my project yet.

275
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,417
Excuse me.

276
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:17,160
If your father found that
here, it could be crucial.

277
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,119
Morning, Mr. Foster.

278
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,163
Wonderful place.

279
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,866
See, Harry, I told
you he was a fruitcake.

280
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,563
Yeah,
but a nice fruitcake.

281
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,394
Don't touch anything.

282
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:36,136
Boy, these
things are great.

283
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,442
Tough to
find a parking spot for them.

284
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,009
Good day.

285
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,315
Any of this equipment
still available?

286
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,403
No, mate.

287
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,013
They here 'cause they look good.

288
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,841
No, it's
not a problem, mate.

289
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,408
They're all available.

290
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,714
Jim, Jim,
you see that guy over there?

291
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:50,933
Don't look, don't look.

292
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,326
Mhm, yes, yes.

293
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,154
He's got a gold coin
from the dune ship.

294
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,504
He's father found
it, our Mr. Reynolds.

295
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:57,592
Mhm.

296
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:58,941
He's a tall man.

297
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,421
Mr. Reynolds is a
short man, as I recall.

298
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,683
No.
He was skinny.

299
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:04,294
No, no, don't look now.

300
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:05,817
Three times a day,
one hour before meals.

301
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,080
OK?
- All right, thanks a lot.

302
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,516
- Bye-bye.
- See you later.

303
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:09,647
- Good day, Mr. Thomas.
- How are you, David?

304
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,171
- All right.
- You sell stamps?

305
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,389
Yeah, just the letter, is it?

306
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,260
Yeah.

307
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,221
$0.27, right?

308
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,224
$0.41, they haven't
been $0.27 in five years.

309
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,880
Right, not a
great correspondent.

310
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,794
Thanks.

311
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,323
This is a beauty.

312
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,324
You like fishing?

313
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:35,282
Yeah.

314
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,544
Your dad teach you?

315
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:37,937
No, I taught myself.

316
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:38,938
My dad was never home.

317
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,156
I had a dad like that.

318
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:45,074
Goodbye.

319
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:49,035
Oh, sorry.

320
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,297
Can you fish?

321
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,559
Of course, I can fish.

322
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:52,516
I was born with a
line in the hand.

323
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,083
What do you use for bait?

324
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,303
Bait?

325
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,304
Mangoes.

326
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:58,348
Mangoes?

327
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,002
Yeah, up north we do.

328
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,351
You don't.

329
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:02,265
We do.

330
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,136
Would I lie to you?

331
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,363
Hey.

332
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:20,370
Mr. Reynolds.

333
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,289
Pillow fishing?

334
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,728
This one's a bit small
on throwing it back.

335
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,906
They say the big ones
run off the dock.

336
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:35,777
You wanna come up?

337
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:39,607
You need a new line.

338
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,700
There's some men
downstairs to see you.

339
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,570
I'll be down in a minute.

340
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,926
No, I know it's
your idea, but so

341
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,319
was last year's sand festival.

342
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,452
Now just keep quiet,
let me do the talking.

343
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,496
All right.

344
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,758
How can I help you, gentlemen?

345
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:07,635
Jim Scraper.

346
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,071
Jim.

347
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,246
For my sins, I'm the
mayor of this town.

348
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,422
This is Harold Lewis.

349
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:13,945
He's the editor
of the local rag.

350
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:14,903
Uh, how are you, Harold?

351
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,078
How do you do?

352
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,427
I believe you've
met Mr. Foster.

353
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,559
Indeed, love that museum.

354
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:19,473
Thank you.

355
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,481
So how are you
enjoying Beachport?

356
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,656
Uh, very much.

357
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,397
Good, good.

358
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,746
And the weather
is up to your expectations?

359
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:32,964
How could I ask for more?

360
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:35,967
Wonderful weather, wonderful.

361
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:40,102
You're here to dig
up the dune ship.

362
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,626
I am?

363
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:45,194
It's the buried
treasure, isn't it?

364
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,978
No.

365
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,373
Coin, he had a coin.

366
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,289
You've come here to steal
our treasure on the quiet.

367
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,595
Absolutely not.

368
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:03,473
Bottom line, Mr.
Reynolds, you can't

369
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:08,043
dig up the sand dunes unless
the local counsel says you can.

370
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,044
And who's the local counsel?

371
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,094
Us.

372
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,921
Yes, I'm
here to find the dunes.

373
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,272
I know where it is
within 50 meters.

374
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:22,188
Nobody knows
exactly where it is.

375
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,364
Satellite photos,
computer enhanced,

376
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,757
reveal a mass beneath
the sand the size

377
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:30,109
and shape of a
Portuguese galleon.

378
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,024
I have got to
see those photos.

379
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,461
No one sees it.

380
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:35,636
Then why
should we believe you?

381
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:36,985
I'm not asking
you to believe me.

382
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,029
Just walk away and
let me get on with it.

383
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,205
Let you get on with what?

384
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:40,554
The thing that'll
save this town.

385
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,859
What do you mean,
what are you saying?

386
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,691
The Japanese trawlers
have taken your fishing,

387
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,650
haven't they?

388
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,697
Farmers have got the ass side
of their strides, haven't they?

389
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:59,225
You're dead in the water, but
this one thing can save it.

390
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,835
Tourism, that's where
the real treasure is.

391
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,315
You think we haven't
tried that, hey?

392
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,751
We've advertised,
had competitions.

393
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,056
You haven't tried the
best thing that you've

394
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,972
got going for you, romance.

395
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:08,843
Romance?

396
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,498
Here in Australia,
we're being discovered

397
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,064
by the international tourists.

398
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,676
And here, right
here in Beachport,

399
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:18,331
we can sell them romance.

400
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:19,201
Now how?

401
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:21,247
I'll tell you how.

402
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,858
We find that dune ship,
and around the dune

403
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:26,817
ship we build a theme park.

404
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,515
It'll be like Disneyland.

405
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,299
We'll call it dune ship park.

406
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,214
And after it's
working, we'll build

407
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,478
another one on the Gold Coast
and call it dune ship world.

408
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,045
And you think of it.

409
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,179
450 years ago, gallant
mariners set out from Europe

410
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:45,575
and found here in the South
Seas adventure, danger, death.

411
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,187
I see.

412
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,580
I can see Portuguese
sailors dressed

413
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:53,322
in exotic costumes,
conquistadors,

414
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,020
buried treasure and caravans.

415
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,284
Oh, come down to Earth.

416
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,546
This
place will rival

417
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:00,634
the Gold Coast of Queensland.

418
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,157
It'll be Australia's Miami.

419
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,724
Now hang on, hang on.

420
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,205
You're talking real money here.

421
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,598
Mr. Mayor, I am
talking real money.

422
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,034
I'm talking money,
money, money--

423
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,212
buckets of lovely money.

424
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:15,301
Now, 40 years ago the
Gold Coast of Queensland

425
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:18,608
was one pub and a lot
of holiday shacks.

426
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:19,914
And now it's a
billion dollar tourist

427
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:21,263
playground, built on what?

428
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,134
Listen, we could
never be the Gold Coast.

429
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,310
It's bullshit, I mean--

430
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,095
Yeah, correct,
built on bullshit.

431
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,665
A billion dollars of
tourism built on bullshit,

432
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:32,622
built on a high.

433
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:35,451
Yes.

434
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:36,844
But do you want to be rich?

435
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:40,108
Oh, yeah.

436
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,154
You want your, uh, miserable
little bits of real estate

437
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:48,247
to become choice blocks
with a million dollars?

438
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,639
That would be nice.

439
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,206
Nice.

440
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:54,775
Well, let me get on with
this my own way, please.

441
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,658
He's got the photos!

442
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:09,659
Gold mine, yes.

443
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,095
Those are my photos!

444
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,532
He's walking away.

445
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,404
Those are my photos!

446
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:16,840
Quick, quick--

447
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,059
You're disturbing
my [inaudible]..

448
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,060
You're the head.

449
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,017
You-- you talk to him.

450
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:20,975
Come on.

451
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:29,157
Reynolds, you count
us in or you don't dig.

452
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,901
Well, I suppose 5%
labor participation

453
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:34,945
isn't going to kill me.

454
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,860
Now that's 5% of the 100%.

455
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,993
5% of 25%.

456
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,474
Oh, no, no.

457
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:42,562
No.

458
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:43,432
Hey, listen.

459
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:44,433
This has been my dream.

460
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,914
I deserve the lion's share.

461
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,263
Forget it, Reynolds.

462
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,177
Hey, please.

463
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:58,317
OK, 5% of 100%, that's
a $50,000 seed money,

464
00:21:58,447 --> 00:21:59,448
and I won't take a penny more.

465
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:02,930
75 then.

466
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,327
All right, 100.

467
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:11,591
You can put in
$100,000, but you have

468
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,506
to give me unconditional
development right

469
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:15,899
of the dunes for five years.

470
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,771
If that doesn't satisfy
you bloodsucking vultures,

471
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:19,599
then stuff it because I'm out.

472
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,470
O-U-T, out!

473
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:33,482
Local money can put in
100,000, that's 100,000.

474
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:37,747
That represents
10% of net profit.

475
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,838
I worked for
years, I get screwed

476
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,362
by a bunch of hillbillies.

477
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,932
Well, thanks, fellas.

478
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,413
My old man was right about
this place, talk about greedy.

479
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,372
You lucky if my share
covers our hotel bill.

480
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,820
You'll
notice that the excavation

481
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,952
site, based on the
evidence in my book,

482
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,693
is a long way from the ocean.

483
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,348
This is because over
the past 400 years,

484
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:16,220
there's been massive shifts
on the shape of the shoreline

485
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:17,961
here.

486
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,703
So when the Portuguese came
here, the Egyptians and perhaps

487
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,357
even the ancient Phoenician--

488
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,620
Out there in section A--
you folks with the shovels,

489
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:25,752
you might as well lean on them.

490
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,755
I need you for a minute.

491
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,627
Now this is how they discovered
the pyramid, you know.

492
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,890
There's no telling

493
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,544
what else far down here.

494
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,372
This could be bigger
than the pyramid.

495
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,766
Of course, you got to be a bit
careful, like digging for eggs.

496
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:42,682
Golden goose eggs!

497
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:44,423
Oh, no, Mr. Mayor.

498
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,512
We've got to keep everyone out
of this roped off area here.

499
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,992
Can't afford to
disturb the surface.

500
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,994
Can I leave that
with you to fix up?

501
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,605
OK, great.

502
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,392
Hey, Harry, my
fish are running.

503
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,698
Yeah?

504
00:23:58,828 --> 00:23:59,699
Got the mango.

505
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,702
Beauty.

506
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:05,400
You reckon we'll
find the dune ship?

507
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,490
Well, if it's there to
be found, we'll find it.

508
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:09,796
Will it have masts?

509
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:10,753
It's hard to tell.

510
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,581
It's been there a long time.

511
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,453
How big will it be?

512
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,193
I'll lend you the book.

513
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:17,630
You can learn a lot from books.

514
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,587
OK.

515
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,067
Let's go.

516
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,218
This is a fantastic place.

517
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,133
Yeah, but all my
friends are in Sydney.

518
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,309
This is better than Sydney.

519
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,920
Wish I'd grown up in
a place like this.

520
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,356
Down here, Harry.

521
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:56,712
What's the matter?

522
00:24:56,843 --> 00:25:00,716
Northeasterly, not
good for mangoes.

523
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,892
You'll have to use what you
know when you're down here.

524
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:04,894
These cost a $1.60.

525
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,331
We'll eat it or we'll save
it to catch tropical fish.

526
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,643
OK.

527
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:15,644
Ooh!

528
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:21,476
You are dangerous.

529
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,522
Born with a line
in your hand, hey?

530
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,048
Give me your yo-yo.

531
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:29,832
What are you gonna do,
catch a fish with it?

532
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:31,617
Just give me your yo-yo.

533
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,370
Eiffel Tower.

534
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,071
Texas Star.

535
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,120
Over the Falls--

536
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,034
Wow.

537
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,517
--and Rock the Baby.

538
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,563
Now, I may not know
everything, but I know yo-yos.

539
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,002
So let's make a deal.

540
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,917
I'll take you and
you teach me, OK?

541
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,707
Yeah, yeah, let me
help you with that.

542
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:22,755
Wow.

543
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,104
Yeah.

544
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,758
Now what you do--

545
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,977
see, when you cast it
out, remember, you push

546
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,457
this thing out and turn that.

547
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,371
You see?

548
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,112
Yeah.

549
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:34,505
Cast it out and
just wait for a nibble, OK.

550
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,811
Right, watch this.

551
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,291
You ready?

552
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:39,685
See, Harry.

553
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:43,036
Wow, that's my best.

554
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,604
Go on, you can do it.

555
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:48,607
Yeah, good arm.

556
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:49,825
Pretty good, hey?

557
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:52,088
Yeah, quick learner.

558
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,220
What's your dad
do for a living?

559
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,833
He's a salesman.

560
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,748
You're a salesman,
aren't you, Harry?

561
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,011
No, I'm a seller.

562
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,796
What's the difference?

563
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:06,276
A salesman goes
to people and tries

564
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,930
to get them to buy things.

565
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,845
But a seller, people come
to him and take things

566
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,847
and shove money in his pocket.

567
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:14,676
Mhm.

568
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,070
Well, Mr. Reynolds,
you created quite a stir.

569
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,593
Some investors to see you.

570
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,421
Ooh, those are nice.

571
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,598
Bring them out in the kitchen.

572
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:24,773
So the mango worked?

573
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:25,774
I got some money to invest.

574
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:26,775
Don't rush me.

575
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:27,907
We didn't want to miss out.

576
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:28,951
Is it a good investment?

577
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,214
Ask Mr. Scraper, he thinks so.

578
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,956
They've invested and
the rest of the council.

579
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,350
See, when
you're a seller, people come

580
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,221
and shove money in your pocket.

581
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:39,527
Oh, yeah.

582
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,182
Yeah, I reckon my
dad was a seller.

583
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:43,531
Yeah, I reckon
you might be right.

584
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,058
David, I don't want
you to be a seller.

585
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,320
Why not?

586
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,582
Because I just
couldn't bear to have

587
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,280
another seller in my life.

588
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,064
I'm gonna go
out and play with the fish.

589
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:59,547
And I don't want you hanging
around with Mr. Reynolds, OK.

590
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,244
OK?

591
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,942
HARRY REYNOLDS
Cec, you're truly a genius.

592
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:06,032
Today was day one of the
great Beachport bonanza.

593
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,469
The town folk are begging
to stuff money in my pocket

594
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,297
and I'm graciously allowing it.

595
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,865
It will be bigger than
even you imagined.

596
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,127
All I need is a
few weeks and I'll

597
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,650
be lying on a beach
in Bali and you'll

598
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,434
have enough money to
live out your days,

599
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,523
however short, in style.

600
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,706
PS, you know, I'm starting
to like this place, Cec.

601
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,055
Beachport is beautiful.

602
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:32,449
A lot of sand and
money, but no dune ship.

603
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:36,976
Morning, gentlemen.

604
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,020
Harry.

605
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:38,891
Morning.

606
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,675
Was looking for you.

607
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:44,113
We'd like to invest
a little more.

608
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,201
I don't have my receipt book.

609
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,072
Oh, that's fine.

610
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:54,167
See, Harry, they're
shoving money in your pocket.

611
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,952
They look like dogs in
suits having a gang bang.

612
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,824
That's disgusting.

613
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:00,477
Where did you learn
language like that?

614
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,392
Just asked my mom
about the Stock Exchange.

615
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:04,612
That would be right.

616
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,526
Harry!

617
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,272
Harry we found it.

618
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,753
We found the dune ship.

619
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,711
All's fair, Harry.

620
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,234
The press are gonna love this.

621
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:19,148
Come on.

622
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:19,975
The dune ship?

623
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:26,765
I've got Harry.

624
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,685
It's just an old tree.

625
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,080
Can't you tell the difference
between a tree and boat?

626
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,170
Definitely a tree.
Norm.

627
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,696
Nearly, Norm, next time.

628
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,960
Uh, do you blokes, uh,
want your checks back?

629
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,657
Uh-huh.

630
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,441
You don't fool us, Reynolds.

631
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:53,095
You made a deal,
you stick with it.

632
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,752
Right.

633
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,536
You've read about it in the
papers, you've seen it on TV.

634
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,539
Now here it is, Beachport,
home of the dune ship.

635
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,280
Dune ship souvenirs
you can find--

636
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,281
Come on, Harry.

637
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:06,456
A real classic, Joe.

638
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:08,197
Can't find these
in Sydney anymore.

639
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:14,943
Hey, listen.

640
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,727
I've had three
phone calls already

641
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,338
this morning, said he managed
selling beachfront properties.

642
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:19,252
Yep, didn't I tell you?

643
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:21,297
Mm-hmm.

644
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:23,734
Mom, look.

645
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,258
It's a classic, isn't it?

646
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,695
See ya!

647
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,222
Come on, Harry.

648
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,702
It's coming to me, that's it.

649
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,313
Here it comes, it's
the king of spades.

650
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,271
It is.

651
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,186
It's the king of spades.

652
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:41,187
All right, quiet.

653
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,797
Now David-- David, there it is.

654
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:45,234
I can see it now, it's
the jack of diamonds.

655
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,148
Yep.

656
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,238
Now think of it.

657
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,414
Think of the card and
it is-- here it is.

658
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,068
It's the six of spades.

659
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,289
Bravo.

660
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,073
Here's another one.

661
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:02,251
I bet that I can push this glass
through the handle of this jug.

662
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:03,774
No way.
I can do it.

663
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:04,950
Who does this
creep think he is?

664
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,342
Who
said you can't?

665
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:06,865
Is that
the best you can do?

666
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:12,609
$20.

667
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,523
Come on, Harry.

668
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:14,873
OK.

669
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,613
Here we go.

670
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,225
Very delicate trick, hasn't
been done by too many people.

671
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:25,274
And I push that glass through
the handle of this jug.

672
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:29,583
Thank you very.

673
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,628
One born everyday.

674
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,847
Very good.

675
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:33,935
Bloody head
through the handle.

676
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:38,287
OK, very good, very good.

677
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,942
Sold a lot of
sand today, Harry?

678
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:43,031
Hey?

679
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,076
David, it's time for bed.

680
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:45,033
Good night, squirt.

681
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,208
Good night.

682
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,995
Hey, will I see you tomorrow?

683
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:53,085
Yeah, if it's
OK with your mom.

684
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:54,434
We'll talk about it later.

685
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,348
- Good night.
- Night.

686
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:56,218
See ya.

687
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,096
I got a bottle in the
kitchen, want a drink?

688
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:05,227
Yeah, I'd love one.

689
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:17,587
So the sleepy little
Beachport is waking up at last.

690
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:20,982
Why is that, Harry?

691
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:22,853
I put it down to
personal magnetism.

692
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,556
Haven't I met
you before, Harry?

693
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:32,385
Well, I don't think so.

694
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,909
No, maybe not.

695
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,216
You're like my
father, same type.

696
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,391
Yeah, that's nice.

697
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:41,829
What's he do?

698
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,572
Well, he, uh,
cheats on my mother.

699
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,835
Here's a man, 58 years
old, cheating on his wife?

700
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,749
Stayer?

701
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:54,842
Oh, no, just to cheat.

702
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,235
And I swear it's
not even the sex,

703
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:59,064
it's the selling,
clinching the deal.

704
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,679
You're selling yourself to
David as the perfect father.

705
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,507
But you taking him fishing,
you're teaching him to surf.

706
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,204
Now just a minute, every
kid should be able to fish

707
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,075
and catch a line.

708
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,859
What's the harm in that?

709
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,904
He has enough problems
without some stranger

710
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,254
fooling with his emotions.

711
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,343
Shit, his own father
did enough of that.

712
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:18,997
I hate to hear a woman
use language like that.

713
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:26,917
Look,
Harry, be a nice man.

714
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,311
We're happy enough as we
are here in little Beachport

715
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:32,053
where nothing ever happens.

716
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:33,011
Leave David alone.

717
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,501
Come on, Harry,
I've got the bait.

718
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:46,459
Let's go.

719
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:47,895
No fishing today, mate.

720
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,505
But you promised last night.

721
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:50,724
Your mom said no.

722
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,291
What?

723
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:53,596
Maybe she thinks we spend
too much time together.

724
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:54,597
Oh, wait here.

725
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,168
I don't believe you did that.

726
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:01,648
Did what?

727
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,389
You told Harry he
couldn't go fishing with me.

728
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,565
We've been having a great time
together and you ruined it.

729
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,350
I told you again and again
to stay away from that man.

730
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,091
Who else am I
going to play with?

731
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,919
You dragged me from the city
down here away from my friends.

732
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,442
Look, David, don't get--

733
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,879
Are your just angry at
him 'cause he's like dad?

734
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,360
That's not his
fault. He knows what

735
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:20,014
it's like not to have a dad.

736
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:20,928
He knows.

737
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:31,373
OK, Harry, let's go.

738
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,245
What about your mom?

739
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,463
It's all sorted out.

740
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:35,986
What you do to
change her mind?

741
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,640
Talk real fast and don't
take no for an answer.

742
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,555
All right, Harry?

743
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:40,426
You're the boss.

744
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:41,340
Let's go.

745
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,210
Yeah.

746
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:45,692
OK,
David, it's alphabet time.

747
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,520
Backwards?

748
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,999
Got to see how
fast you can say like Z, Y X,

749
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,305
and W, V, U,T, S, R, Q, P,
and O, N, M, and L, K J,

750
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,742
and I, H, G, F, E,
D, C, B, A. Good,

751
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:53,743
you're getting a little better.

752
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:54,875
Yeah.

753
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,790
Gordo does names backwards.

754
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,490
You know, like David Maguire,
that's Eriugam Divad.

755
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:04,145
Henry Reynolds, that's Sdlo--

756
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,452
Sd-- Sdlonyer Yrrah.

757
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:07,322
Sit on your ear?

758
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:08,758
Thanks.

759
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,804
And mom's--

760
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,720
Oh, this is a stupid game.

761
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,896
Tell me about your dad.

762
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:18,377
I hate my dad.

763
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,856
You don't.

764
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:20,770
I do.

765
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:31,868
Look who's coming.

766
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:35,524
So is this the outdoors?

767
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:37,483
That's the sky, that's the sand.

768
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,267
And all that wet
stuff, that's the--

769
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,356
That's the ocean.

770
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,576
I've heard about all this.

771
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,578
I thought I'd like to share
some of it with my son

772
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,015
before he grows up.

773
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,260
Bravo!

774
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,478
- cricket.
- Hurry, Harry, get it.

775
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:17,262
Get a run.
OK.

776
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,698
Run!

777
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,134
Harry, hurry!

778
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,051
Get it!

779
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,967
Oh, US
one, Australia zip.

780
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,490
Not for long.

781
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:29,752
Don't kill the batter.

782
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,189
OK.
- Come on, Davey.

783
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,102
Give me a good one.

784
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,016
Good one.

785
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,716
Come on.

786
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:38,065
Get out of the way,
I'm coming through.

787
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,501
Hurry.

788
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:40,415
Don't bother.

789
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,329
Home run!

790
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:45,899
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

791
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:46,813
Oh, crap.

792
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,296
You all right?

793
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:52,166
I'm fine.

794
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:53,428
I'm great.

795
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,908
Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

796
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:56,953
On the left, the magnificent
dune ship is here.

797
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,870
And on the right,
the magnificent

798
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:01,871
dune ship picture theatre.

799
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,178
You like the movies, son?
- Love it.

800
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,310
Beautiful, that's for you.

801
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,050
Yay.

802
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,009
And here, in the center of
the jewel, the dune ship itself.

803
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,271
That is, if you find it.

804
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:11,925
- We'll find it.
- We'll find it.

805
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,187
Yeah!

806
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,407
And beyond, the
world famous Carinya

807
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:18,148
Guesthouse where many
of you are staying,

808
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,498
managed and staffed by--

809
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,064
- David Maguire!
- Yeah!

810
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:21,935
And owned by--

811
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,066
Julie Maguire!

812
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,119
What's that?

813
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,686
What that?

814
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:36,906
You were just got.

815
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:44,349
You know, Harry, I

816
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,567
hope you do find the dune ship.

817
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:52,139
Oh,
Boomtown is busted,

818
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,054
the rigs are all rusted.

819
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:57,971
There's no lights on
my Christmas tree.

820
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:02,410
Well, I tried El Paso
and I tried Amarillo,

821
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:06,458
but I didn't find a
drop of Texas tea.

822
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,764
Well, they hit us
when we're down,

823
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:14,640
and we can't get up though we're
trying with all of our powers.

824
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,209
Now the bottle's run dry
and I'm wondering why,

825
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,602
flushed out and--

826
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,038
Last
week, we had one bus.

827
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,431
This week, four a day.

828
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:24,650
Things are looking
up, I say, gentlemen.

829
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,173
- Uh-huh.
- Hi.

830
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,915
Morning.

831
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:31,700
Invest in a theme park?

832
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:32,658
Yes.

833
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:33,572
No, you can't do that.

834
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:34,964
Yes.

835
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:38,751
I've just had a
settlement in from my ex.

836
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:41,319
I've got $30,000.

837
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,277
Normally, I just buy
David and me a toy each

838
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:44,626
and I put the rest
toward the mortgage.

839
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:48,587
Yeah, well, I suggest
you do just that.

840
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:50,937
You're saying it's
a bum investment?

841
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,504
No, it's a great investment.

842
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:53,896
Well, if it's such
a great investment,

843
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,116
why don't you want my money?

844
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,684
Because--

845
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:04,864
Mhm, mhm, mhm, Harry,
I want in.

846
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,387
Here!

847
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:07,867
I'm not gonna take this money.

848
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:08,824
No way!

849
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:11,871
I'm not gonna take it.

850
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:18,007
Harry, everybody in
town thinks that you're

851
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:21,010
screwing the socks off me.

852
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,098
But I'm not.

853
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,883
I know that, Harry.

854
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:28,714
I know that, but
nobody else does.

855
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:31,325
Now what are they gonna think
if you won't take my money?

856
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,736
Excuse me, Giles would
like to talk with you.

857
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,302
- Harry.
- Giles, how are you?

858
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,216
Harry Reynolds.

859
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,740
Giles, that $20--

860
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,132
I've been meaning
to get that back to you.

861
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,917
Silly trick.

862
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,135
You wouldn't believe the number
of people that fall for that.

863
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,094
Oh, Harry,
we got a problem.

864
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:02,704
Anything I can do
to help, anything.

865
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,271
We need to have a talk.
- Yeah?

866
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,664
What about, Giles?

867
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:08,406
I got a business
proposition for you.

868
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:09,581
Oh, great, great.

869
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:20,766
When I talk business,
I like to be comfortable.

870
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:23,595
Are you comfortable, Harry?

871
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:29,122
You know,
I like to negotiate

872
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,646
from a position of power.

873
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:32,647
OK, Billy!

874
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:37,565
Billy.

875
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,923
Now I've got a little
proposition for you, Harry.

876
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:49,838
Now I don't want you
to feel pressured,

877
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,623
but I hope you won't say no.

878
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,844
I'm saying, yes, Giles.

879
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,412
Sight unseen,
handshake deal, yes.

880
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:02,111
I'm glad
you see it my way, Harry.

881
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:04,026
You know, you're a lot
smarter than you look.

882
00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:06,420
OK, Billy, shut if off!

883
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:13,688
You see, Harry, a smooth
life can be when you sit down

884
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:16,299
and discuss things
like reasonable people.

885
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,997
I don't want to
disrupt the flow Giles,

886
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:21,435
but the dozer's coming this way.

887
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:22,697
Where's the manual?

888
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,612
Jesus.

889
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,223
Do you see what I gotta
bloody put up with?

890
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,399
Will you quit playing
with that bloody thing?

891
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,140
I'm trying to take
a meeting here!

892
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:34,622
I told you that's only
if the bastard says no!

893
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,798
Turn it off!

894
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,278
You bloody prick!

895
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,801
What do you think you're doing?

896
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:40,802
Uh.

897
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:43,196
I'm saying yes, Giles.

898
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:44,066
We all like a little laugh.

899
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,547
Turn the bloody thing off!

900
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:50,725
Uh, [inaudible].

901
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:51,726
I've an alter boy.

902
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:53,032
I went to Holy Cross.

903
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,773
Sister Mary Thomas
gave me

904
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,905
for cleaning the black board.

905
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:57,906
You said you could drive it!

906
00:41:58,037 --> 00:41:59,255
You're gonna run over him.

907
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:00,648
No, you said I could drive it.

908
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:02,128
But he's no bloody
good to us dead.

909
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:05,218
please,
please, God, fundamentally

910
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:06,524
a decent human being.

911
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:09,396
Please don't let
them make me dead!

912
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:13,356
See?

913
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:23,889
Let's just back it up.

914
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:24,759
Yeah.

915
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:42,211
I've come into
some money, Harry.

916
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,865
Good.

917
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:45,432
Yeah, a certain
interest in the city of leasing

918
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,260
my back paddocks, you know.

919
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,262
It's a vertically
integrated operation

920
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,569
where they grow the crop
and process it, and then

921
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,396
merchandise it down
to street level.

922
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,224
I don't want to know
what the crop is, Giles.

923
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,662
Please don't tell me.

924
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:01,187
I need to launder
this money, Harry,

925
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:04,016
so I want you to sell me 10
points in your dune ships

926
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:07,715
scheme for $1,000.

927
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:10,457
I know I'm in a weak
negotiating position

928
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:17,551
here, Giles, but 10
points is $100,000.

929
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:20,336
I'll give you a 1,000
for the 10 points.

930
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,644
You give me a receipt for
a 1,000 to show the taxman,

931
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,734
and then I'll make you
a present of $99,000

932
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:28,562
that the taxman doesn't
need to know about.

933
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,613
Deal?

934
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:36,483
Uh-huh.

935
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:53,326
1,000, 99,000.

936
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:55,807
Oh, Harry, I took my 20 back.

937
00:43:55,937 --> 00:44:01,987
A gift, Harry, that
both of us can now forget.

938
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,945
Well, this is Billy.

939
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,731
He'll be looking after
you and the money.

940
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,908
I mean, I don't want you
leaving town here, do I, Harry?

941
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,303
Dig him out, Billy.

942
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,218
I mean, we can't leave a
company director laying here

943
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,480
on the sand dunes, now can we?

944
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:20,092
I'll be
seeing you, Harry.

945
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:25,010
Bye.

946
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:28,753
Hi, Billy.

947
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:33,801
Be careful, hey.

948
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:35,585
I admire the way you
drive that bulldozer,

949
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,718
Billy, like a real pro.

950
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,937
Thanks, Harry.

951
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:40,765
Giles likes it when
I do a good job.

952
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:41,809
Yeah, I bet.

953
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,898
When I don't, he yells at me.

954
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:45,813
What exactly is
your job, Billy?

955
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:48,294
Oh, I break people's
arms and legs.

956
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:49,338
It's a family business.

957
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,992
Me mom got me the job.

958
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,428
Good old mom.

959
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,691
I like her.

960
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:20,413
Oh.

961
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:28,334
Very
promising, hey, tiger?

962
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:29,683
Mhm.

963
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:30,684
Very promising.

964
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:31,641
Mhm.

965
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:32,555
[speaking japanese].

966
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:37,560
We'll fix that.

967
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:41,782
Can I help you?

968
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:43,088
I'm looking for
a gentleman called

969
00:45:43,218 --> 00:45:46,918
Reynolds, Harry Reynolds.

970
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:47,962
He's in his room.

971
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:49,007
I'll see if he's available.

972
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:49,834
Yep.

973
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:58,059
Harry.

974
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:04,500
Harry, some
gentleman to see you.

975
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:05,501
I'll talk to him later.

976
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:08,200
I'm feeling a bit off color.

977
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,376
That's funny,
you seemed fine a while ago.

978
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:11,594
It's all very sudden.

979
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:27,480
Can I get you something?

980
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,395
No, I think I'll just
spend a bit of time in bed.

981
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:37,403
I mustn't panic.

982
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:38,317
Don't want to panic.

983
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:45,237
Man to see you, Harry.

984
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:46,151
Uh?

985
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,376
Hello, Harry.

986
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:57,510
You remember me?

987
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,817
Dad, is that you?

988
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:01,557
I did not take your wallet.

989
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:02,558
Cut the crap, Harry.

990
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:04,473
Bottom line, you're a thief.

991
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:07,433
Now look, I deal with thieves
in business all the time.

992
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:09,348
Now this is very good,
this scheme of yours.

993
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:10,436
It's not a scam.

994
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:11,567
Scheme, I said scheme.

995
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:12,481
I think it's very good.

996
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:14,309
You must go on with it.

997
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,181
Oh, then maybe I could fit you
in for a few thousand, 10 or 20

998
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,530
maybe.

999
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,314
No, I'm not gonna
give you any money.

1000
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:21,447
You want money, you gotta get
it off of those suckers there.

1001
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:23,579
No, look, I can make my
profits out of this my own way.

1002
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,972
Right.

1003
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:26,365
Look, for a start, you
see this place here,

1004
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:27,366
this Carinya guesthouse?

1005
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:28,628
That'll go.

1006
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:29,977
Tourist hotel
there, resort hotel.

1007
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:32,023
Over here, high
rise condominiums.

1008
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:33,807
This fishing pier, this
will become a marina.

1009
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:35,287
Fisherman will just
have to piss off.

1010
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,898
A man who owns just
1% of the concrete

1011
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:41,815
that will pour in this
place will be a millionaire.

1012
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,383
Now this is a good idea
you've got here, Harry.

1013
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:47,168
Just keep it going, hey?

1014
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:52,739
You stay in this town, and
you do your theme park,

1015
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,610
or I'll send you
straight back to jail.

1016
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,664
Give me your trousers.

1017
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:06,448
What?

1018
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:08,059
Your trousers.

1019
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:08,929
My trousers?

1020
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,843
You've gotta be joking.

1021
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:26,773
Remember
Harry, I wear the trousers.

1022
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,485
No
visitors please.

1023
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,705
Harry.

1024
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:46,575
Julie.

1025
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,278
Can you shut the door?

1026
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:54,148
The drafts.

1027
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:00,981
You manage to eat something?

1028
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:02,156
Yeah, it was lovely.

1029
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:14,038
But still a bit hot.

1030
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:17,824
Mhm.

1031
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,740
Oh, no, no, no, it
feels very good.

1032
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,700
Very good.

1033
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,702
Mhm, very good.

1034
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:49,464
I brought you this, Harry.

1035
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:53,381
Well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

1036
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:54,643
It's very kind of you, David.

1037
00:49:58,082 --> 00:50:01,694
Oh, I think you're
gonna die, Harry.

1038
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:06,568
Come on, drink up.

1039
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:09,006
Remember Harry, you gotta get
better for the dance tomorrow

1040
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:09,876
night.

1041
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:19,538
I got troubles,
you got troubles,

1042
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:23,455
all God's children got troubles.

1043
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:27,633
Living in bad water.

1044
00:50:27,763 --> 00:50:32,855
Bad water trying to
roll all over me.

1045
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:41,168
Harry, the dance, all
the chicks are down there.

1046
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:44,824
Your investors, you gotta
impress your investors.

1047
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:48,523
Oh, Harry, I can't handle
them all on me own.

1048
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,351
All right, all right.

1049
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:51,874
Get outside and
I'll get dressed.

1050
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:52,832
Yeah!

1051
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:55,530
Come on, Billy.

1052
00:50:55,661 --> 00:51:04,452
What am I doing here?

1053
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,758
All right, mate, do your stuff.

1054
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:07,020
That's what you're here for.

1055
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:09,762
Smile for your
customers, sell them.

1056
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:11,633
It's showtime.

1057
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,990
Hey, there, Giles.

1058
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:25,125
We've
been prosperous tonight,

1059
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:26,344
fellow investors.

1060
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,216
- How are you, Harry?
- I got too much to do.

1061
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:30,217
Goodnight, all.

1062
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:31,436
coming tonight?

1063
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:32,350
Hi, Billy.

1064
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,829
How are you?

1065
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,004
Who's this guy?

1066
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:36,484
So you city guys
dance or what?

1067
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:37,877
Us city guys dance.

1068
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:38,834
You joking?

1069
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,575
Whoa.

1070
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:43,491
I like
the way you walk.

1071
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:45,667
I like the way you talk.

1072
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:47,452
Which one of us
is the prettiest?

1073
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:51,804
Let me hold you
hand, try to understand.

1074
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:57,288
I want a girl like you,
tell my troubles to you.

1075
00:51:57,418 --> 00:52:00,247
Don't be afraid.

1076
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,380
You've heard what I said.

1077
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,903
Hey!

1078
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:05,557
Let the
four wind blow.

1079
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:05,861
Whoa!

1080
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:10,736
Yeah.

1081
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:19,310
and make it happen.

1082
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,486
We'll make money, money,
money, money, money, money.

1083
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:22,748
What are you gonna
do with the money?

1084
00:52:27,361 --> 00:52:32,323
Harry, I've come to invest.

1085
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:36,805
Aren't you gonna give your
dear old, Uncle Cec a kiss?

1086
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:38,633
You nearly gave me
a bloody heart attack.

1087
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,374
You deserve one, you
thieving young mongrel.

1088
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:42,333
You stole my research,
years of hard work.

1089
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:44,291
I thought
you were gonna [inaudible]..

1090
00:52:44,422 --> 00:52:45,945
Anyway, I never thought
you'd see the outside again.

1091
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:47,425
Early release came, pal.

1092
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:48,730
What do you mean
early release came?

1093
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:49,818
I'm rehabilitated.

1094
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,037
You?

1095
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,169
Yeah, I got
three psychiatrists

1096
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,431
to say I'm rehabilitated.

1097
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:54,736
What, you got a
pot from my money?

1098
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,042
Now how much have we got?

1099
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:01,787
You've been doing banks, Harry?
'Cause if you've been doing

1100
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:02,875
banks, that's the stone end.

1101
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:04,137
I'm finished with you.

1102
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,182
I have not been
doing banks, honest.

1103
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:06,052
Drugs?

1104
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,185
Shut up, Cec!

1105
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:10,622
If you dealing drugs, that is
the stone end of a family man.

1106
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:11,971
I'm not dealing in drugs.

1107
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:13,015
You're doing
something illegal.

1108
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:14,278
Now look.

1109
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:15,583
There's 20, 30,000
in this damn top.

1110
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:16,497
Now what you got in here?

1111
00:53:16,628 --> 00:53:17,368
193, 000.

1112
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:18,325
A 109--

1113
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:19,370
Shh!

1114
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,459
Be quiet.

1115
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:22,634
They're greedy.

1116
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:24,331
They just keep forcing it on me.

1117
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:26,986
We better get out of here.

1118
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,292
You've got a car?

1119
00:53:28,422 --> 00:53:29,075
Of
course, I got a car.

1120
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:29,989
Follow me.

1121
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:35,690
We got all the towels
we need, thanks.

1122
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,170
Jeez.

1123
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:38,563
You distract King Kong
and I'll take the money

1124
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:39,825
and we'll meet back in Sydney.

1125
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:42,175
Are you sure, Cec?

1126
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,611
All right.

1127
00:53:43,742 --> 00:53:47,354
Later on, we both come
back, have a few beers,

1128
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:52,490
have a bit of a chat, give it an
hour and, psh, out the window.

1129
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,535
Harry, I can tolerate a
lot, but don't tell me

1130
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,408
you're going moral on me.

1131
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:58,452
Time to leave, Harry.

1132
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:15,774
All right.

1133
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:17,906
Come on, Godzilla,
I'll buy you a drink.

1134
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:21,780
Now it's your turn--

1135
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,260
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

1136
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:29,178
--to cry over me.

1137
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:31,137
You look terrific
in your suit.

1138
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,530
Yeah, I like it too.

1139
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:42,844
Every
road has a turning--

1140
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:44,193
Why don't you go get
something to drink?

1141
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:45,630
- OK.
- Yeah?

1142
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:53,725
And that's one
thing you're learning.

1143
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:06,520
I cried for you.

1144
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:20,795
Oh, what a fool I used to be.

1145
00:55:23,755 --> 00:55:25,626
I suppose you'd like to
dance with the big city guy.

1146
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:37,464
But I've found two
eyes just a little bit bluer.

1147
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:51,086
I found a heart just
a little bit truer.

1148
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:52,174
I like it here, Harry.

1149
00:55:56,962 --> 00:55:59,051
I think I like it here better
than any place I've ever been.

1150
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:01,619
I cried for you.

1151
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:09,235
My grandpa has got a
suit just like yours.

1152
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,020
Yeah?

1153
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:13,500
Sharp dresser, is he?

1154
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:15,023
Yeah.

1155
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:17,678
Mom said he could sell
refrigerators to Eskimos.

1156
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:22,814
Eskimos need refrigerators,
kid, to keep their beer warm.

1157
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:25,643
Are you Japanese?

1158
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:30,038
Hi.

1159
00:56:40,048 --> 00:56:41,789
Cec and me gonna
sink a few cold ones.

1160
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,356
Come and join us, Billy.
I can't.

1161
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,444
I'm on duty.

1162
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:45,793
Here, then take
half of theirs,

1163
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:46,968
make your duty a little easier.

1164
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:48,274
You sure?

1165
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,231
Absolutely, for saving

1166
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:50,319
my life with that bulldozer.

1167
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,451
Well, thanks, Harry.

1168
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:57,501
One hour, another hour.

1169
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,770
Bloody woman!

1170
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,249
There's, of course,
a man's downfall.

1171
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,250
They brought sin in the world.

1172
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,687
See you tomorrow, Cec.

1173
00:57:09,817 --> 00:57:12,907
Look, I'm a family man,
but I can't abide women.

1174
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:14,518
Oh, you know what, Harry?

1175
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:15,432
You'll regret it.

1176
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:16,824
Am I right, Billy?

1177
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:20,524
Billy's nodding his
head, yes, Harry.

1178
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:22,656
Am I spoiling your
plans for the evening?

1179
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,445
Slow down.

1180
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,185
We've got all the
time in the world.

1181
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:35,016
No, I can talk to
Cec any old time.

1182
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:38,803
Well, I bet he gets lonely.

1183
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:41,588
This is OK, isn't it?

1184
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,024
I mean, I get a little
embarrassed with Billy

1185
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:46,114
out there.

1186
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:49,030
You're very
strange, aren't you, Harry?

1187
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:50,249
It's not my fault
I'm straight outta

1188
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:51,468
Holy Cross primary school.

1189
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,874
It's always a
matter of trust, David.

1190
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:10,748
The whole world
operates on trust.

1191
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:13,315
And the man who has
confidence in you,

1192
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:15,013
a man who gives
you his trust is--

1193
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:16,057
A man to watch out for.

1194
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:16,971
Right, Cec?

1195
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:21,976
The kid's got a lot
of talent, probably

1196
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:23,891
more than you had at that age.

1197
00:58:24,022 --> 00:58:25,153
I was a pro at his age.

1198
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,547
Harry, don't lie to me.

1199
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:29,288
I happen to know your
old man didn't go to jail

1200
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:30,942
until you were fully 13.

1201
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:32,726
Well, you stay
away from the kid.

1202
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:34,293
Don't even corrupt him.

1203
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:37,209
Then we both gotta leave town.

1204
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:40,517
Here is
your tea and milk, yeah.

1205
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:47,611
All right, but
not until the night.

1206
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:50,178
I'm gonna say
goodbye to the kid,

1207
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:51,832
and I'm giving Julie
her money back.

1208
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:58,665
Here we go.

1209
00:58:58,796 --> 00:58:59,927
Ow!

1210
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:08,893
Hey, what you doing?

1211
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:10,068
Knock your block off.

1212
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,199
What you reckon, Harry?

1213
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,592
You got a great
surf here, mate.

1214
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:15,203
I only wish I could
do this every day.

1215
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,988
You do realize,
though, that I just

1216
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:19,207
can't solely spend the rest of
my life swimming and fishing.

1217
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:21,775
I'm a businessman, and
businessman have to take trips.

1218
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:23,211
Yeah, my dad
used to take trips.

1219
00:59:23,342 --> 00:59:24,082
And mine.

1220
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:30,828
You going away, Harry?

1221
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:33,352
Well, yeah.

1222
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,745
Well, I mean not--

1223
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,399
I might have
to go away for a trip

1224
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,621
some time and I don't want
you sort of thinking that--

1225
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:46,017
look, my dad went away a lot,
and I turned out pretty good.

1226
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:54,112
Didn't I?

1227
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,635
Yeah, Harry.

1228
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,071
You turned out the best.

1229
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:01,946
So will you.

1230
01:00:02,076 --> 01:00:03,643
I mean, a boy needs
his mom and his friends

1231
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,253
when he's growing up.

1232
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:07,604
But sooner or later, he's
gotta get out on his own,

1233
01:00:07,734 --> 01:00:09,606
and then it's what's
inside him that matters.

1234
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:14,219
And you're gonna
be the very best.

1235
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:17,309
Hey!

1236
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:22,357
I got something for you.

1237
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,666
It sort of lights up, you know.

1238
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:34,761
I'm waiting!

1239
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:38,635
And a book.

1240
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,640
Harry!

1241
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:48,688
You better go
and see that man.

1242
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:54,389
I'll see you at the
blessing of the fleet night.

1243
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:09,361
Hop in.

1244
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:18,283
What do you want, Bostock?

1245
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,764
This local council's
giving me the runaround.

1246
01:01:20,894 --> 01:01:22,156
Every time I ask
them for something,

1247
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:25,159
they say, Mr. Reynolds
has it all tied up.

1248
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,074
What did you do to get
this cockamamie five year

1249
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:28,249
option, hypnotize them?

1250
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,250
They practically
forced it on me.

1251
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:30,991
It's all their idea.

1252
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:34,255
Well, in my eye, is
that you forced yourself

1253
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:36,780
to help the man who could
call your parole officer

1254
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:39,434
and tell him where you are
and what you've been doing.

1255
01:01:43,264 --> 01:01:47,051
This is a contract
drawn up by my lawyers.

1256
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:50,054
It transfers to my
company all the rights

1257
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:53,579
and permits that you've
obtained from the local counsel.

1258
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,582
Well, I'll have to read it.

1259
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,845
Well, you do that, Harry.

1260
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:01,282
And I'll just call
your parole officer.

1261
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:04,938
Do you have the
telephone number?

1262
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:06,592
This is very
unethical behavior.

1263
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,812
That's all right because
I have the telephone number.

1264
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:14,948
Eight digits, wasn't it, Harry?

1265
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,341
The number four?

1266
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,135
It's ringing, Harry.

1267
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:32,096
Hello?

1268
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,579
Oh, could you just hold
on a moment, please.

1269
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:47,938
I'm sorry, it was
a wrong number.

1270
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:50,505
I'm
getting to like this place.

1271
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:52,899
I don't want you destroying it.

1272
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,728
Well, conservationists, hey?

1273
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,862
It's kinda touching.

1274
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:01,908
It's so beautiful,
so unspoiled.

1275
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:05,738
Might be unspoiled to you,
Harry, but it's unused to me.

1276
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:07,479
I mean, what's the use
of all this scenery

1277
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:10,395
if millions of people can't see
it, and how much more beautiful

1278
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,441
when it turns a profit.

1279
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:18,751
Cement, Harry, it's the
mother Earth to the developer.

1280
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,492
You're a snake, Bostock.

1281
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:23,234
Well, please, Harry.

1282
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:24,409
Flattering.

1283
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,216
God, I love this view of
the guesthouse, don't you?

1284
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:50,565
Yeah.

1285
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:51,697
It could do with
some paint, though.

1286
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,005
Maybe cream with a red trim?

1287
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,049
Oh, I don't know.

1288
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,659
I like it just the way it is.

1289
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,444
Looks great.

1290
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:01,011
Wish it could stay
that way forever.

1291
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,013
It will.

1292
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,057
Oh, look, they're starting.

1293
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,801
God, our
father, you created this--

1294
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,546
Yep, the blue boat,
that's the King Fisher.

1295
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:18,115
Wouldn't it be great to
own a fishing boat, Harry?

1296
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:21,335
Cecil Arthur Heggarty,
what a surprise.

1297
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:23,163
Sergeant.

1298
01:04:23,294 --> 01:04:24,991
Sergeant Watts, isn't it?

1299
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:26,906
We haven't brought our
checkbook and credit cards back

1300
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:28,516
to Beachport, have we, Cecil?

1301
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:30,257
No,
Sergeant, just a holiday.

1302
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:31,693
Ah.

1303
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:34,435
And where
are we staying, Cecil?

1304
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:37,830
He's staying at the
guesthouse, Sarge.

1305
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,006
I wouldn't take any checks
if I was you, Mrs. Maguire.

1306
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,577
The last time Cecil was
here, what, uh, five years

1307
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:47,448
ago, he cashed a lot of checks.

1308
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,321
I had to send him away
to Sydney for a holiday.

1309
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:51,539
Harry.

1310
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,150
That's discrimination,
Sergeant.

1311
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,760
What you're doing
is illegal under

1312
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,196
the anti-discrimination act.

1313
01:04:56,327 --> 01:05:00,766
Oh, I'm a bad boy.

1314
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,899
Yeah, and your timing
is atrocious, Sergeant.

1315
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:04,726
You were
arrested here by passing paper

1316
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:06,467
and you came back?
- I had to come back.

1317
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:08,339
You stole my research
and I knew you'd be here.

1318
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,036
- What'd you think of it, Harry?
- It was great.

1319
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:10,994
Great parade.

1320
01:05:11,124 --> 01:05:12,299
Thanks.

1321
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,648
You couldn't have
even done the scam.

1322
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:15,476
I had to check if
Watts had moved on, get

1323
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:16,608
a partner in if he hadn't.

1324
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,610
You-- I was grooming you for it.

1325
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,003
You didn't even do
the research, did you?

1326
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,004
It was all
[inaudible],, wasn't it?

1327
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:22,135
You make these accusations.

1328
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:23,310
Wasn't it?

1329
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,311
All right, I'll tell you.

1330
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:25,486
He didn't know what he had.

1331
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:26,879
It was all bloody
history to him.

1332
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,489
He couldn't see the potential.

1333
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:29,795
That's what I get for mixing
with the criminal class.

1334
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,362
You've got no moral
sense, no brains.

1335
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:33,320
Oh, you should talk,
sleeping with a divorced woman.

1336
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:35,279
You leave me out of this.

1337
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:37,063
It's the morality
I can't stand.

1338
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:44,941
- Harry, I want to talk.
- Later, please.

1339
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:46,290
I want to talk now.

1340
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,466
David, you go do
something in the kitchen.

1341
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,685
Uncle Cec-- tell me.

1342
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:52,122
Tell me now.

1343
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:53,166
Cec has had a bit of
hard luck in his time

1344
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:54,385
and I'm just trying to help him.

1345
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:55,647
Please don't
bullshit me, Harry.

1346
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:56,822
I used to get this
from my husband.

1347
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,215
I can hear it.

1348
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:00,043
I can hear it by the
way you're saying it.

1349
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:02,001
No, he's not your uncle.

1350
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:03,176
Tell me, where do
you know him from?

1351
01:06:03,307 --> 01:06:04,134
Come again?

1352
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:05,570
Where?

1353
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:09,574
Where, the YMCA, youth
hostels, church choir?

1354
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:10,444
Long Bay jail.

1355
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:17,799
Oh, I am such a fool.

1356
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,410
I am such an idiot.

1357
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,715
Look, I wasn't
gonna take your money.

1358
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:22,630
Oh, no, just everybody else's.

1359
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:23,892
Well, they forced it on me.

1360
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,068
They're greedy mongrels.
You saw that.

1361
01:06:25,198 --> 01:06:26,765
You saw them.

1362
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:29,594
They just came and they just
stuffed it in your pocket.

1363
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:31,030
Look, Julie, I never thought--

1364
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:34,164
Well, I have lunch to cook.

1365
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:36,557
In big business,
Billy, nobody trusts you.

1366
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:37,558
I've always found--

1367
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:38,559
Get straight off my bed.

1368
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:39,430
Oh, still touched, are we?

1369
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,214
You too, Billy.

1370
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:43,173
Come on, Billy, I'll buy you
a beer, tell you about women.

1371
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:45,914
They may smell like roses,
but that bouquet is one part

1372
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,916
rose, 11 parts carbon monoxide.

1373
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,484
I promised Giles I'd
stay and watch the money.

1374
01:06:50,615 --> 01:06:53,139
Harry won't let
that money out of his sight.

1375
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,967
See, he even locked the door.

1376
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:56,490
Come on, let's go.

1377
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:57,361
All right, then.

1378
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:02,322
MAN
Harry Joseph Reynolds,

1379
01:07:02,453 --> 01:07:04,368
three convictions
of false pretenses,

1380
01:07:04,498 --> 01:07:06,935
partner associate of
Cecil Arthur Heggarty.

1381
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:07,849
Make sure--

1382
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,763
That's all I need.

1383
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:14,508
Back off, Giles.

1384
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:17,076
He's mine.

1385
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:18,295
So where is your partner, Cec?

1386
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:19,165
What partner?

1387
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:20,340
You stay--

1388
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:21,254
Yeah, call him
by his first name.

1389
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:22,429
I pay taxes.

1390
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,474
Hey, you let these
cons out of jail

1391
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:24,518
and screw all our citizens.

1392
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:25,606
Now you watch your language.

1393
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:29,045
Aw, blow it out
your nose, pop.

1394
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:32,091
Reynolds, you better have
all my money or the next time

1395
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:34,789
I bury you it won't be in sand!

1396
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,184
Hey, hey, Brain Damage--

1397
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:40,056
Please don't call
me that, Giles.

1398
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:42,623
If you let that Reynolds
bastard out of your sight,

1399
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:46,540
then I'm gonna rip
your head off, huh?

1400
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:49,717
It's all
right there, $94,000.

1401
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:51,415
I want
your receipt books

1402
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:53,591
and I want you in the council
hall at 7 o'clock tonight

1403
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,201
to talk to your investors.

1404
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:57,160
You got a warrant, Sarge?

1405
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,509
I've checked
your record, Harry.

1406
01:07:58,639 --> 01:07:59,945
You're on parole.

1407
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,165
You can go back
inside just like that.

1408
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:04,863
Fine, I got nothing to hide.

1409
01:08:09,433 --> 01:08:10,651
Sit down.

1410
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:13,219
dune
ship research 20 years.

1411
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:14,829
Is it true you've
been to jail?

1412
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:28,756
Please, please.

1413
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:31,759
Please give Harry a
chance to say something.

1414
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:37,374
Why shouldn't he have
another chance to speak?

1415
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:53,346
Harry, tell me--
tell us all the truth.

1416
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:58,525
The truth.

1417
01:08:58,656 --> 01:09:00,440
Yes, please.

1418
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:01,615
Just tell us the truth.

1419
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:09,797
Truth is, I'm a conman--

1420
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:18,937
--three months since I was
born, turned pro at seven.

1421
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,417
I've taken a lot
of people's money.

1422
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:21,679
I've had three convictions.

1423
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:22,593
No.

1424
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,556
No!

1425
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:30,470
David.

1426
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:42,743
No, Harry, you're a liar!

1427
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:44,745
Liar, liar!

1428
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:50,925
Listen, he's told us
himself he's a conman.

1429
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:03,460
I don't think we need to waste
a lot of time on Harry Reynolds.

1430
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,157
I mean, Harry's of no account.

1431
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:07,768
But the interesting thing
about Harry Reynolds

1432
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:11,294
is the great idea he
bought to Beachport.

1433
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:17,517
The dune ship theme park will
put Beachport on the map.

1434
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:22,261
So Harry, thank you and goodbye.

1435
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:25,830
Now get these nice
people back their money,

1436
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,048
and get on your bike.

1437
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,790
Now just a minute.

1438
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:32,880
I'm a conman, I admit it.

1439
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:36,014
But I'm small time
compared to him.

1440
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:37,929
If he has his way, he'll
change this town so you'll

1441
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:39,365
never recognize it again.

1442
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,759
You're bullshit, your
dune ship's bullshit.

1443
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:43,369
Not
bullshit, Giles.

1444
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,547
A myth, a thing to live by.

1445
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:49,114
A dream to take us all through.

1446
01:10:51,029 --> 01:10:53,640
And look at what's been going on
in this town in the last month.

1447
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:57,383
This place came around,
there's cars in the street.

1448
01:10:57,514 --> 01:11:00,081
People from out of town
are spending money here.

1449
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:02,867
Real estate, your real
estate and your real estate,

1450
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,086
it's starting to move.

1451
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:08,394
People are pulling
money out of mattresses.

1452
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:10,527
This ghost town is
coming alive again.

1453
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,340
This town's on its way now.

1454
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:44,038
You don't need me,
you don't need him.

1455
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:46,302
You don't need anybody
but yourselves.

1456
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:56,790
I found something here that
I could only imagine before,

1457
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,183
but I don't deserve this place.

1458
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:06,191
Just don't sell this town to
the bastards of the world.

1459
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,933
They'll destroy it.

1460
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:13,198
Words, just pretty words.

1461
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:18,116
What I am offering you is real.

1462
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:22,686
My references are
governors, bank presidents,

1463
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:24,601
merchants with full wallets.

1464
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:27,299
What are your references, Harry?

1465
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,171
The warden at Long Bay prison?

1466
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:34,175
Look, Harry.

1467
01:12:34,306 --> 01:12:35,263
Take a look.

1468
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:43,576
I found the dune ship!

1469
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:46,579
I found it!

1470
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:49,016
The dune ship, I
found it, Harry!

1471
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:50,496
I found it!

1472
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:54,500
The dune ship-- the dune
ship, I found it, Harry.

1473
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:55,501
What?

1474
01:12:55,632 --> 01:12:57,460
The dune ship, I saw it!

1475
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,462
The dune ship--

1476
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,464
Shut up!

1477
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:02,813
The dune ship's
there, I saw it.

1478
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:03,770
Where?

1479
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:04,684
Stamper Point.

1480
01:13:04,815 --> 01:13:05,859
It's really there.

1481
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:07,034
The storm blew
all the sand away.

1482
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:08,427
It's there.

1483
01:13:08,558 --> 01:13:10,386
I knew it.

1484
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:14,128
Stamper Point, just
like I've always said.

1485
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:15,739
It's the moon and the tides.

1486
01:13:15,869 --> 01:13:17,001
Oh, I knew it.

1487
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:30,101
Come on, Harry.

1488
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,961
We always knew it'd be there.

1489
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:06,746
Didn't we, Harry?

1490
01:14:06,877 --> 01:14:10,924
They came halfway around the
world in that little ship,

1491
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:12,752
almost like going
to another planet.

1492
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:41,999
As-- as
you'll notice up here,

1493
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:46,525
you'll see by the geological
location and [inaudible],,

1494
01:14:46,656 --> 01:14:51,487
this would have to be the--
the most important wreck

1495
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:54,315
found in the world.

1496
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:57,623
I mean, it's an enormous
significance to,

1497
01:14:57,754 --> 01:15:00,974
uh, to international
or ecological studies.

1498
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:04,674
It's-- it's-- it's
infinitely precious.

1499
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:07,459
I mean, this would have
to be the Tutankhamun's

1500
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,113
tomb of the South sea.

1501
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:10,767
Harry, we can make
a fortune out of this.

1502
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:12,203
Let's stick around
and see what happens.

1503
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,204
We delivered.

1504
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:14,422
Look, let them calm down.

1505
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:15,772
They'll be grateful,
and we can--

1506
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:17,251
Listen.

1507
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:18,296
The ship was a fluke, Cec.
We're con artists.

1508
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:19,166
That's our job, isn't it?

1509
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:20,080
Conning people.

1510
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,089
I think that's
yours, Mrs. Maguire.

1511
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,352
Thanks, Sarge.

1512
01:15:31,483 --> 01:15:32,223
Mr. Giles.

1513
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:44,801
$1,000, as per receipt.

1514
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:45,845
Is that it?

1515
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:47,673
I mean, there isn't any more?

1516
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:51,111
The last of the big
spenders, hey, Giles?

1517
01:15:51,242 --> 01:15:52,765
No.

1518
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,941
No, that'll be more than
enough to pay for the funeral.

1519
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:15,396
Harry,
you're just gonna

1520
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:16,920
leave without saying goodbye?

1521
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,051
I was gonna get around to it.

1522
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:27,670
I don't want you to go without
knowing there's a place for you

1523
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,758
here if you want it.

1524
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:29,628
Do you reckon?

1525
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:32,588
Yes, I reckon.

1526
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:35,199
Look at this town, Harry,
you breathed life into it.

1527
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:37,505
You let something loose here.

1528
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:39,246
Can't you stay and
see it through?

1529
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:02,618
You're better than you
think you are, Harry.

1530
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:48,228
That'll be right.

1531
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:49,316
You'll be wanting some money?

1532
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:52,015
I'll be wanting 99 grand.

1533
01:17:52,145 --> 01:17:53,930
Giles, I'm about to
put in a counter offer.

1534
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,453
I've had some expenses.

1535
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:59,283
I want you to listen
before you react, 50 grand.

1536
01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:00,893
50?

1537
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:02,808
50!

1538
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:06,507
You jail birds, you crawl out
of your sewers like slime rats.

1539
01:18:06,638 --> 01:18:08,118
You come down here
wearing suits.

1540
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:09,380
You're cheating
us honest farmers.

1541
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:12,122
We gotta work for a living.

1542
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:13,601
Break his bloody arm, Billy.

1543
01:18:17,257 --> 01:18:19,216
All right, Giles.

1544
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:20,826
Harry.

1545
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:25,962
I hate to do this, but
Harry and Cec are me mates.

1546
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:28,181
Your mates?

1547
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:30,183
You moron.

1548
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:31,489
You bloody imbecile.

1549
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:35,406
You cretinous dead shit!

1550
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:37,190
I can't stand bad language.

1551
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,543
50, Giles, 50.

1552
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:44,197
Yes, severe penalty
for early withdrawal.

1553
01:18:44,328 --> 01:18:45,633
Best offer you'll get all day.

1554
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:47,418
Harry.

1555
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:50,290
Don't think revenge, think
of two words, income tax.

1556
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:56,644
Count on me for a
reference, Billy.

1557
01:18:56,775 --> 01:19:00,126
Let that be a lesson.

1558
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:01,562
Here, let me help you, Giles.

1559
01:19:01,693 --> 01:19:03,129
Just piss off.

1560
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,652
Well, you can't keep
being rude to people, Giles.

1561
01:19:04,783 --> 01:19:06,742
Just stop!

1562
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:07,786
Is it OK if I quit, Giles?

1563
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:08,700
I think you're sick.

1564
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:13,661
Good for you, Billy.

1565
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,503
Now where's the money,
you thieving young bastard?

1566
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:30,983
I know it's here somewhere.

1567
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:32,071
There's 40 here.

1568
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:40,123
You got it on you, haven't you?

1569
01:19:40,253 --> 01:19:41,341
All right, stop the car.

1570
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:42,342
It's a strip search.

1571
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:43,474
Get your bloody clothes off.

1572
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:50,394
Right on time, Harry.

1573
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,096
Here you go, Harry.

1574
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:00,534
Thanks, mate.

1575
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:06,889
The black fish are running.

1576
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:16,376
Harry, you don't want a woman
and a kid around your neck.

1577
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:17,813
I had some once
and it interfered

1578
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:18,770
with my career moves.

1579
01:20:23,209 --> 01:20:25,429
On the other hand, we--

1580
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:28,606
we could take the kid with us.

1581
01:20:28,736 --> 01:20:31,304
Harry, what a team the
three of us would make.

1582
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:32,958
We can work the
airline terminals

1583
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:34,351
and he could tell the old
ladies he's lost his ticket.

1584
01:20:34,481 --> 01:20:35,569
You'd like that,
wouldn't you kid?

1585
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,440
Can I come, Harry?

1586
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,571
Can I?

1587
01:20:37,702 --> 01:20:39,617
You are a moral
defective, Cec.

1588
01:20:39,747 --> 01:20:41,140
That's a horrible thing to say.

1589
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:45,405
Davey, listen to me.

1590
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:54,458
Here, this will get you
to Melbourne in style.

1591
01:20:54,588 --> 01:20:58,331
No, Cec, you
gotta go to Sydney.

1592
01:20:58,462 --> 01:20:59,898
Ah, take
it all, you deserve it.

1593
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:02,031
It was a great scam.

1594
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:04,772
Get on, mate.

1595
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:06,296
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1596
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:08,559
It's past
now, Harry.

1597
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:12,128
Maybe, I wouldn't bet on it.

1598
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:15,348
See you, Cec.

1599
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,829
Come on, square.

1600
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,439
How do you reckon
it'll go, Davey?

1601
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,746
Oh, she'll be all right, mate.

1602
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,704
Tell him to get off his ass.

1603
01:21:23,835 --> 01:21:25,054
Look, we're paying
him an arm and a leg,

1604
01:21:25,184 --> 01:21:27,143
so I tell him to get
off his backside, hey.

1605
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,710
Ah, could-- could we just have
a word with you, Mr. Bostock.

1606
01:21:29,841 --> 01:21:30,929
Just a minute.

1607
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,148
Uh,
what

1608
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:33,627
you were saying last
night about, uh,

1609
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:35,020
Reynolds having a good idea--

1610
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:36,500
Well, now we have
our money back.

1611
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,154
What we thought--

1612
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:39,329
We thought of getting a
similar scheme off the ground.

1613
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:42,288
So we'd like to
invest with you.

1614
01:21:42,419 --> 01:21:43,855
Well, look, there will
be a dune ship theme

1615
01:21:43,986 --> 01:21:46,031
park, gentlemen,
but, uh, we won't

1616
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:48,164
be having a local investment.

1617
01:21:48,294 --> 01:21:49,121
What?

1618
01:21:49,252 --> 01:21:50,079
We're offering you money.

1619
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:51,732
I've got money.

1620
01:21:51,863 --> 01:21:53,473
Now it's-- look,
it's-- it's our dune ship.

1621
01:21:54,518 --> 01:21:56,302
No, it's not.

1622
01:21:56,433 --> 01:21:57,695
It's my dune ship.

1623
01:21:57,825 --> 01:22:00,567
You gave Harry Reynolds
full development rights.

1624
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,743
Well, he sold them to me.

1625
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:03,657
He sold them?

1626
01:22:03,788 --> 01:22:05,007
Harry did that?

1627
01:22:05,137 --> 01:22:07,009
Hey, he made a
handsome profit too, hey.

1628
01:22:07,139 --> 01:22:10,055
And believe me,
gentlemen, it's all legal.

1629
01:22:10,186 --> 01:22:14,494
It's just like Reynolds
to stab you in the back.

1630
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,452
Are you still there?

1631
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:16,670
Yeah, right.

1632
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:18,411
Look, I want the
engineer over here

1633
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:19,978
too because I want to get this
road underneath the other--

1634
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:20,848
There is Harry.

1635
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:27,768
I'll handle this.

1636
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:52,228
What are you doing
back, Reynolds?

1637
01:22:52,358 --> 01:22:53,751
You forget something?

1638
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:59,017
Yeah, I came back to
stop you ruining our town.

1639
01:22:59,148 --> 01:23:03,195
You get in my way and
I'll see you back in jail.

1640
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:05,502
And you wouldn't like
that, would you, Harry?

1641
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:09,375
To save this town, try me.

1642
01:23:09,506 --> 01:23:13,379
Ah, Harry, he said you
sold him all the right.

1643
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,468
Now why did you do that, Harry?

1644
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:17,557
Oh, I don't remember
selling him anything, Norm.

1645
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:20,430
Once a liar, always a liar.

1646
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,998
Let me refresh
your memory, Harry.

1647
01:23:23,128 --> 01:23:27,045
He signed all his
rights over to me.

1648
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:30,875
Now what we have here is a
completely legal document.

1649
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:38,752
Harry.

1650
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,500
Hello.

1651
01:23:47,631 --> 01:23:49,459
Who, Bostock.

1652
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:51,156
Yeah, there was
somebody by that name,

1653
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,941
but he had to leave
town quite suddenly.

1654
01:23:54,072 --> 01:23:55,291
Didn't he?

1655
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:58,772
Council meeting in
half an hour, fellows.

1656
01:23:58,903 --> 01:23:59,643
David!

1657
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:04,561
Mom!

1658
01:24:13,526 --> 01:24:16,834
How you reckon it'll go, Harry?

1659
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,357
Well, she'll be
all right, mate.

1660
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:23,319
Oh, my hand shakes
steady and my words are sweet,

1661
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:26,844
and the whole world's
lying here at my feet.

1662
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:33,938
Put your trust in me,
put your trust in me.

1663
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,942
I rub my eyes and
I catch my breath.

1664
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,380
I'm almost choking on
the smell of success.

1665
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:46,211
Put your trust in me,
put your trust in me.

1666
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:59,442
I get careless now and then,
but I won't let you down again.

1667
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:06,013
I got x-ray eyes.

1668
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,973
And with just one
look, I can read

1669
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,410
your future like an open book.

1670
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:16,633
Put your trust in me,
Put your trust in me.

1671
01:25:47,881 --> 01:25:58,153
I get careless now and then,
but I won't let you down again.

1672
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:06,639
Oh, my hand shakes steady
and my words are sweet,

1673
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:10,295
and the whole world's
lying here at my feet.

1674
01:26:10,426 --> 01:26:52,076
Put your trust in me,
put your trust in me.
