1
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,636
<i>Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.</i>

2
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:47,844
<i>And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.</i>

3
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,437
<i>Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith</i>

4
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:58,442
<i>sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.</i>

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:05,616
<i>Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,</i>

6
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,491
<i>an ancient force of infinite destruction.</i>

7
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,782
Malekith.

8
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,667
Asgard's forces are upon us.

9
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,285
<i>The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,</i>

10
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:31,429
<i>waged a mighty war
against these creatures.</i>

11
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,692
Send in the Kursed!

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,295
<i>As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,</i>

13
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,845
<i>Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.</i>

14
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,152
Ahh!

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,234
<i>But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.</i>

16
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,449
<i>Without it, the Dark Elves fell.</i>

17
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,928
<i>With the battle all but lost,</i>

18
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,590
<i>Malekith sacrificed his own people</i>

19
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,473
<i>in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.</i>

20
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,649
Their deaths will mean our survival.

21
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,103
This war is far from over.

22
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:19,333
<i>Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.</i>

23
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,244
<i>Or so we were led to believe.</i>

24
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,049
Sire, the Aether.
Shall we destroy it?

25
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,086
If only we could.

26
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,095
But its power is too great.

27
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,174
Bury it deep.

28
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,722
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

29
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,556
Loki.

30
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,269
Hello, Mother.

31
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,643
Have I made you proud?

32
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,184
Please, don't make this worse.

33
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,110
Define "worse."

34
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,862
Enough!

35
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,319
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

36
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,714
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

37
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,252
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

38
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,220
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

39
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,382
and death.

40
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,769
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.

41
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,105
Just like you.

42
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,060
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

43
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,607
Just as humans do.

44
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,940
Give or take 5,000 years.

45
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,861
All this because Loki desires a throne.

46
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,370
It is my birthright.

47
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,874
Your birthright was to die

48
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,913
as a child.

49
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,504
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

50
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,633
If I had not taken you in,

51
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,420
you would not be here now to hate me.

52
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,722
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

53
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,300
just swing it.

54
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,602
It's not that I don't
love our little talks,

55
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,600
it's just...

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,353
I don't love them.

57
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,688
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

58
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,189
and you will never see her again.

59
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:57,404
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

60
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,655
And what of Thor?

61
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,875
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

62
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,537
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

63
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,224
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

64
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,340
and then, yes...

65
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,173
He will be king.

66
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,013
Ah!

67
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,267
I've got this completely under control!

68
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,474
Is that why everything is on fire?

69
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,444
Ah!

70
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,041
You're welcome.

71
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,707
Ha!

72
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,772
All yours.

73
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,375
Hello.

74
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,300
I accept your surrender.

75
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,527
Anyone else?

76
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,952
Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.

77
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,163
Keep moving. Come on!

78
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,097
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

79
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,884
Where do we go next?

80
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,022
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

81
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,688
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

82
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,443
Asgard can wait.

83
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,821
You have my thanks.

84
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,654
As you have mine.

85
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,455
Heimdall, when you're ready.

86
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,373
Is Vanaheim secure?

87
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,004
As are Nornheim and Ria.

88
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,846
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

89
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,883
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

90
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,131
That was not my intent.

91
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,641
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,

92
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,514
the Nine Realms are at peace.

93
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,100
They're well reminded of our strength

94
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,894
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.

95
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,102
Thank you.

96
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,730
Nothing out of order

97
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,029
except your confused
and distracted heart.

98
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,444
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

99
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,501
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

100
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,694
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

101
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,039
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,

102
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,166
but as your father.

103
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,246
You are ready.

104
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,378
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

105
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,250
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

106
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,381
Join your warriors.

107
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,929
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

108
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,391
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

109
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,563
Another!

110
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,866
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.

111
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,295
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

112
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,664
so much that you nearly
started the second.

113
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,333
Well, the first was so much fun.

114
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,846
Take a drink with me.

115
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,016
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

116
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,021
No, this is one I set myself.

117
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,065
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

118
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,437
There are nine realms.

119
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,574
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

120
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,406
I thank you for your sword

121
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,618
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

122
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,097
Hi.

123
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,433
Hi.

124
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,925
So, what's the story with you?

125
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,641
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

126
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,982
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

127
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,032
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

128
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,531
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

129
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,745
I think there's a story

130
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,078
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

131
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,085
It's complicated.

132
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,415
Is he still around?

133
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,542
No, he...

134
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,211
went away.

135
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,750
I've been there.

136
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,964
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

137
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,469
I was seeing a woman

138
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,427
and she took a job in New York.

139
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,887
Eventually, the distance killed it.

140
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,436
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

141
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,188
- No!
- Oh, so many.

142
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,351
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

143
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,564
Sure, I'd love some.

144
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,278
Richard, this is Darcy.

145
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,781
What are you doing here?

146
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,984
Oh. Hello.

147
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,829
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,

148
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,667
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,

149
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,502
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

150
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,661
You know who.

151
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,875
Ah.

152
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,419
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

153
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,133
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

154
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,251
Is there a point to all this?

155
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,415
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

156
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,679
Right.

157
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,774
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

158
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,268
You might want
to start looking at it again.

159
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,434
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

160
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,555
It's malfunctioning.

161
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,640
That's what I said.

162
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,605
That's what I did.

163
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,652
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

164
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,373
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

165
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,610
It doesn't look like nothing.

166
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,251
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

167
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,367
Our friend Erik

168
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,487
kind of went banana balls.

169
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,579
He's not interested.

170
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,656
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

171
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,328
It's time for you to go now.

172
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,792
Okay.

173
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,168
Short but sweet.

174
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,966
She needs help.

175
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,179
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

176
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,215
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

177
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,684
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

178
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,315
Sea bass...

179
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,600
Sea bass.

180
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,106
Jane?

181
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,778
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

182
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,901
and go after your friend.

183
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,023
This was so fun.

184
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,947
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

185
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,827
And I hate you.

186
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,587
What? I said he was cute.

187
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,711
Just shut up and drive.

188
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,162
- You need to take the next left.

189
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,054
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

190
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,394
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

191
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,516
Hello, Dr. Foster.

192
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,482
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

193
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,855
Right. I have to call Erik.

194
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,322
Oh, take a right.

195
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,658
And a left.

196
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,706
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

197
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,326
Hi, Erik. It's me again.
Where are you?

198
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,371
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

199
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,918
I'm here at Stonehenge

200
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,254
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.

201
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,086
<i>The police were called to the scene</i>

202
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,671
<i>shortly after 11 A.M. this morning</i>

203
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,179
<i>after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area</i>

204
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,056
<i>then, decided to strip naked
and effectively</i>

205
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,305
<i>terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment</i>

206
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,315
<i>whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.</i>

207
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,695
<i>The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

208
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,398
<i>has been called in
for questioning by police.</i>

209
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,448
Come on, this is exciting.

210
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,737
Look! The intern is excited.

211
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,072
Ian.

212
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,665
Do you want the phase meter?

213
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,208
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

214
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,164
The toaster-looking thing.

215
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,876
Yeah. I know
what the phase meter is.

216
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,924
How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?

217
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,974
An astrophysicist with three degrees

218
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,802
should be able
to change her own ringtone.

219
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,995
Why are you calling me?

220
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,723
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

221
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,854
- Ian. My name is Ian.
- Shh.

222
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,038
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

223
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,660
It's okay, we're Americans.

224
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,711
Is that supposed to make them like us?

225
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,539
- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.

226
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,467
Oh, they're kids.

227
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,919
Are you the police?

228
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,264
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

229
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,640
Thanks.

230
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,430
We just found it.

231
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,853
Can you show us?

232
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,834
That doesn't seem right.

233
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,897
Where'd it go?

234
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,449
That's...

235
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,125
That's incredible!

236
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,261
What happened?

237
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,801
Sometimes they come back.

238
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,515
Sometimes they don't.

239
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,685
I want to throw something!

240
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,933
Jane, give me your shoe.

241
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,733
I haven't seen readings like this since...

242
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,356
Since...

243
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,482
New Mexico?

244
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,951
Don't touch anything!

245
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,293
Give me your shoe.

246
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,132
Oh.

247
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,816
Were those the car keys?

248
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,672
Whoa. Ah!

249
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh!

250
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,513
Darcy!

251
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,728
Oh!

252
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,804
The Aether awakens us.

253
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,440
The Convergence returns.

254
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,828
You're late.

255
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,162
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.

256
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,968
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

257
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,670
Perhaps.

258
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,675
How fare the stars?

259
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,507
Still shining.

260
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,468
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.

261
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,097
Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?

262
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,355
Yes.

263
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,851
The alignment of the worlds.

264
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,735
It approaches, doesn't it?

265
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,857
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

266
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,119
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

267
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,077
But while its effects can be dangerous,

268
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,751
it is truly beautiful.

269
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,504
I see nothing.

270
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,209
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

271
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,390
How is she?

272
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,471
She's quite clever,
your mortal.

273
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,844
She doesn't know it yet,

274
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,430
but she studies
the Convergence <i>as</i> well.

275
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,813
Even...

276
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,979
What?

277
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,234
I can't see her.

278
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:23,238
Jane!

279
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,111
Where the hell were you?

280
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,863
Tell me you didn't call the police.

281
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,068
What was I supposed to do?

282
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,991
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

283
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,287
You call the cops,
they call the Feds.

284
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,286
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.l.E.L.D. crawling all over

285
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,958
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

286
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,128
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

287
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,499
We had unimpeded access.

288
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,127
Our only competition was ten years old!

289
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,837
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

290
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,627
What?

291
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,140
That's weird.

292
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,120
Typical.

293
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,914
Jane.

294
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,332
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

295
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,001
It's been a very strange day.

296
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,669
I am. Jane, what...

297
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,133
Where were you?

298
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,338
Where were you?

299
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,598
Heimdall cannot see you.

300
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,509
I was right here where you left me.

301
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,853
I was waiting, and then I was crying

302
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,516
and then I went out looking for you.

303
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,226
You said you were coming back.

304
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,733
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

305
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,439
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

306
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,733
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

307
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,898
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

308
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,238
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

309
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,164
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

310
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,793
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

311
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,666
but I was wrong.

312
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,706
I was a fool.

313
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,051
But I believe
that fate brought us together.

314
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,178
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

315
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,008
What?

316
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,307
I know...

317
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,638
You do?

318
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,232
Do what?

319
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,976
What?

320
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,561
Hey!

321
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,780
Is this you?

322
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,574
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.

323
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,661
Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.

324
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,907
Hold that thought.

325
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,920
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

326
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,669
How's space?

327
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,875
Space is fine.

328
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,252
Excuse me.

329
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,539
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

330
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,587
Do you know this man?

331
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,256
He's my intern.

332
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,596
My intern's intern.

333
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,719
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

334
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,099
You'll have to come with me.

335
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,894
Jane.

336
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,654
- Jane.
- Thor?

337
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,981
Are you all right?

338
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,362
What just happened?

339
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,444
Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.

340
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,574
This woman is unwell.

341
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,654
She's dangerous.

342
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,998
So am I.

343
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,119
Requesting armed response officers
to scene.

344
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,120
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

345
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,510
Holy shit.

346
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,039
We have to do that again.

347
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,495
Hi.

348
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,504
Welcome to Asgard.

349
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,532
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

350
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,737
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

351
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,661
Our survival will be your legacy.

352
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,292
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

353
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,623
I will reclaim the Aether.

354
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,958
I will restore our world.

355
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,759
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

356
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052
What's that?

357
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,183
Be still.

358
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,106
This is not of Earth.
What is it?

359
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,570
We do not know.

360
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:22,246
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.

361
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,464
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?

362
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,921
It's a soul forge.

363
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,259
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

364
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,175
Yes.

365
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,048
Quantum field generator.

366
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,098
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

367
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,386
She is ill.

368
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,764
She is mortal.

369
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,477
Illness is their defining trait.

370
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,279
I brought her here
because we can help her.

371
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,232
She does not belong here in Asgard

372
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,773
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

373
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,532
Did he just...

374
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,201
Who do you think you are?

375
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,825
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

376
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,534
Protector of the Nine Realms.

377
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,283
Oh. Well, I'm...

378
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,294
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

379
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,622
You told your dad about me?

380
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,966
Something is within her, Father.

381
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,404
Something I have not seen before.

382
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,634
Her world has its healers.

383
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,672
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

384
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,594
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

385
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,467
No, I would not...

386
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,394
touch her.

387
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,809
Jane, are you all right?

388
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,473
Yeah.

389
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,437
It's impossible.

390
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,399
The infection... It's defending her.

391
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,321
No.

392
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,491
It's defending itself.

393
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,531
Come with me.

394
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:51,456
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.

395
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,498
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

396
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,001
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

397
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,339
They had a dawn

398
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,674
as they will have a dusk.

399
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,005
But before that dawn

400
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:10,521
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

401
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,369
"Born of eternal night

402
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,334
"for the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."

403
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,610
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

404
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,943
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

405
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,618
and it was called the Aether.

406
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,743
While the other relics
often appear as stones

407
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,496
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

408
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,252
It changes matter into dark matter.

409
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,964
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

410
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,177
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

411
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:46,090
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

412
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,384
But, after eternities of bloodshed

413
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,062
my father Bor finally triumphed

414
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,726
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.

415
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,898
What happened?

416
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,110
He killed them all.

417
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,403
Are you certain?

418
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,563
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

419
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,820
and yet here it is.

420
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,410
The Dark Elves are dead.

421
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,543
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

422
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,620
No.

423
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,248
It does not.

424
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,969
The worlds are nearly aligned.

425
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,142
You will be the last of the Kursed.

426
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,937
Let my life be sacrificed.

427
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,615
It is no less than our people did,

428
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,446
or you have done.

429
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,210
You will become darkness.

430
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,132
Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

431
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:11,259
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

432
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:21,148
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

433
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,377
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

434
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,637
Oh, please!
If they were beneath you,

435
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,840
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

436
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,522
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

437
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,699
Odin continues to
bring me new friends.

438
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,821
How thoughtful.

439
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,541
The books I sent,
do they not interest you'?

440
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,334
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

441
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,541
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

442
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,671
Have you?

443
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,552
Does Odin share your concern?

444
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,551
Does Thor?

445
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,344
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

446
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,555
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

447
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,439
My actions?

448
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,852
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

449
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,607
That I was born to be a king.

450
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,654
A king?

451
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,732
A true king admits his faults.

452
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,297
What of the lives you took on Earth?

453
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,035
A mere handful
compared to the number

454
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,908
that Odin has taken himself.

455
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,745
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

456
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,837
Then am I not your mother?

457
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,010
You're not.

458
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:19,770
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

459
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,117
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

460
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,490
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

461
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,287
You were no longer on Earth.

462
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,746
How is that possible?

463
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,919
I believe you were and you weren't.

464
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,873
The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil

465
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,418
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

466
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,714
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

467
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,016
and we call this the Convergence.

468
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,810
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

469
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,271
It's possible
you found one of these points.

470
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,529
We are lucky that it remained open.

471
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,943
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

472
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,408
then the connection is lost.

473
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,545
I like the way you explain things.

474
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,215
What's going to happen to me?

475
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,974
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

476
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,307
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

477
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,184
Don't let him hear you say that.

478
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,853
Jane Foster...

479
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,275
Please meet Frigga,

480
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,273
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

481
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,490
Hi.

482
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,036
Move!

483
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,872
To the dungeons!

484
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,248
Come on!

485
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,486
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

486
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,878
The prisons.

487
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,835
- Loki...
- Go.

488
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,840
I will look after her.

489
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,861
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

490
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,693
There's no pleasing some creatures.

491
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,854
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

492
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,201
You have my word.

493
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,376
Very well, you do not have my word.

494
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,254
Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.

495
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,929
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

496
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,684
- Odin.
- Frigga.

497
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,552
Go!

498
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,597
It's a skirmish.

499
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,893
Nothing to fear.

500
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,475
You've never been a very good liar.

501
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,480
Take her to your chambers.

502
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,436
I'll come for you when it's safe.

503
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,063
You take care.

504
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,267
Despite all I have survived,

505
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,784
my queen still worries over me.

506
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,111
It's only because I worry over you

507
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,079
that you have survived.

508
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,790
Listen to me now.

509
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,920
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

510
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,208
Yes, ma'am.

511
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,417
Oh!

512
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,167
- Ow!
- Ah!

513
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,892
The throne of Asgard
is destroyed! To the king!

514
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,700
Frigga.

515
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,923
Stand down, creature,

516
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,713
and you may still survive this.

517
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,890
I have survived worse, woman.

518
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,719
Who are you?

519
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,308
I am Malekith.

520
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,099
And I would have what is mine.

521
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,362
Ah!

522
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,927
You have taken something, child.

523
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,012
Give it back.

524
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,490
Witch!

525
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,696
Where is the Aether?

526
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,119
I'll never tell you.

527
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,333
I believe you.

528
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,001
No!

529
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,518
<i>The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle</i>

530
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,167
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

531
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,758
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.
And...

532
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,552
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.

533
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,683
Normally, they're separate.

534
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,560
But during the Alignment,

535
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:22,186
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

536
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,521
All nine realms
are passing through each other

537
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,944
and gravity, light, and even matter,

538
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,650
is crashing from one world to the other.

539
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,907
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

540
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,492
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

541
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,498
This time, the Alignment

542
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,581
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

543
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,249
It's beautiful.

544
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,923
It's simple. Any questions?

545
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,094
Yeah.

546
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,267
Can I have my shoe back?

547
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,022
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

548
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:15,117
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

549
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:51,983
Jane Foster?

550
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,820
You need to come with us.

551
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,162
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

552
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,701
Our artillery cannot detect them.

553
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,620
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

554
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,919
My king, we are all but defenseless.

555
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,968
She's your prisoner now?

556
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,680
Leave us.

557
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,854
I do not wish to fight with you.

558
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,102
Nor I with you.

559
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,029
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

560
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,485
We possess the Aether.

561
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,365
Malekith will come to us.

562
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,526
Yes, and he will destroy us.

563
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,738
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

564
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,206
No, I value our people's lives.

565
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,664
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

566
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,629
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

567
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,706
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

568
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,671
And I will destroy it and him.

569
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,463
If you fail, you risk this weapon

570
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,389
falling into the hands of our enemies.

571
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,885
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

572
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,977
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

573
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,395
we would never even know it.

574
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,726
If and when he comes

575
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:12,982
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

576
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,482
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

577
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,571
As many as are needed!

578
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,742
Ah!

579
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,078
We will fight!

580
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,125
Till the last Asgardian breath.

581
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:35,962
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

582
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,214
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

583
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,018
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

584
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,115
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

585
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,159
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

586
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,123
- What's S.H.l.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

587
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,121
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

588
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:13,041
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

589
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,757
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

590
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,792
<i>Something else
went missing this week</i>

591
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,963
<i>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

592
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,637
<i>notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</i>

593
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,096
<i>streaked nude across...</i>

594
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,808
Darcy,
you really need to look at this.

595
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,142
Your friend, Erik...

596
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,973
What was his last name again?

597
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,311
<i>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</i>

598
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,525
<i>He was later taken into police custody</i>

599
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,445
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

600
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,656
<i>Police are still refusing to confirm...</i>

601
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,210
You were not at Odin's war council.

602
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,675
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

603
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,172
No one is to come

604
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,548
or to go.

605
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,349
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

606
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:11,228
What use is a guardian such as that?

607
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,432
Malekith will return, you know this.

608
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,023
I need your help.

609
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:23,240
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

610
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,984
I'm not asking you to.

611
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,536
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged

612
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,243
whether he is or not.

613
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,123
But he is blinded, Heimdall

614
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,951
by hatred and by grief.

615
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,707
As are we all.

616
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,003
I see clearly enough.

617
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,706
The risks are too great.

618
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,716
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

619
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,593
There is no other way.

620
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,766
What do you require of me?

621
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,433
<i>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</i>

622
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,770
<i>Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.</i>

623
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:04,740
<i>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</i>

624
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,446
<i>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</i>

625
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,739
<i>but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

626
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,741
We must move Jane off-world.

627
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,581
The Bifrost has been shut down

628
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,420
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

629
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,708
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

630
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,714
One, actually.

631
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,547
No.

632
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,180
Thor. After all this time

633
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,937
and now you come to visit me.

634
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,439
Why?

635
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,818
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

636
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,566
Loki, enough.

637
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,826
No more illusions.

638
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,086
Now you see me, brother.

639
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,512
Did she suffer?

640
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,973
I did not come here to share our grief.

641
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,185
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

642
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,812
Go on.

643
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,645
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

644
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,694
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

645
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,354
Vengeance

646
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,943
and afterward, this cell.

647
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:39,497
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

648
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,754
What makes you think
you can trust me?

649
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,251
I don't.

650
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,049
Mother did.

651
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,838
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

652
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,139
I did so with a glimmer of hope

653
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,092
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

654
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,187
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

655
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,392
You betray me, and I will kill you.

656
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,404
Hmm.

657
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,615
When do we start?

658
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,033
He will betray you.

659
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,736
He will try.

660
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,701
This is so unlike you, brother.

661
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,869
So clandestine.

662
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,235
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

663
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,874
If you keep speaking, I just might.

664
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,842
Fine. As you wish.

665
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,382
I'm not even here.

666
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,214
Is this better?

667
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,884
It's better company at least.

668
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,933
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

669
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,858
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

670
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,401
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

671
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,737
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

672
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,947
given that you seem
to like them so much.

673
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,529
Oh, this is much better.

674
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,613
Ooh.

675
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,575
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

676
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,038
But the confidence...

677
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,624
I can feel the righteousness surging.

678
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,256
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

679
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:09,924
Honor? Patriotism?

680
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,001
God bless Amer...

681
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,055
What?

682
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:21,929
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

683
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,972
My dagger, something.

684
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,729
At last.

685
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,530
A little common sense.

686
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,202
And I thought you liked tricks.

687
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:45,832
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

688
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,746
who will see you coming
from miles away.

689
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,547
I won't be the one who comes for her.

690
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,340
I'm not hungry.

691
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,884
What the...

692
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,220
Good. Let's go.

693
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,647
You're...

694
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,777
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

695
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,402
That was for New York.

696
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,858
I like her.

697
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,655
And what of the Allfather?

698
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,039
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

699
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,785
You called me here on an urgent matter.

700
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:27,827
What is it?

701
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,583
Treason, my lord.

702
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,006
Whose?

703
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,753
Mine.

704
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,002
My king!

705
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,087
The mortal has been taken.

706
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:41,967
Stop Thor.

707
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,178
By any means necessary.

708
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,391
There they are! Take them.

709
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,483
On my command.

710
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,777
I'll hold them off. Take her.

711
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:54,817
Thank you.

712
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,777
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

713
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,622
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

714
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:14,549
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

715
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,168
what good would it do?

716
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,130
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

717
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,432
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

718
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,305
I will give you as much time as I can.

719
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,231
Thank you, my friend.

720
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,568
If you even think about betraying him...

721
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,316
You'll kill me?

722
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,401
Evidently, there will be a line.

723
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,802
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.

724
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,758
I said, "How hard could it be?"

725
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,133
They're on the ship!

726
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,264
Get to the ship!

727
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,566
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

728
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,019
- Shut up, Loki.

729
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,279
You must have missed something.

730
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,115
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

731
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,784
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

732
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,744
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

733
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,865
Ha, ha!

734
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,087
Get him! Get him!

735
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,152
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

736
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,661
Look,
why don't you let me take over?

737
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,995
I'm clearly the better pilot.

738
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,209
Is that right?
Well, out of the two of us,

739
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,832
which one can actually fly?

740
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,935
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

741
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,011
Jane.

742
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:33,805
I'm okay.

743
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,937
Ah!

744
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,280
Not a word.

745
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,776
Now they're following us.

746
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,282
Now they're firing at us.

747
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,792
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,

748
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,210
it's not at all distracting!

749
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,375
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

750
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,146
You know, this is wonderful.

751
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,561
This is a tremendous idea.

752
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,819
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

753
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,229
and escape in that.

754
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,484
Flying around the city,

755
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,941
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

756
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,785
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

757
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,920
I see your time in the dungeons

758
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,594
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

759
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,766
You lied to me.

760
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,387
I'm impressed.

761
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,938
I'm glad you're pleased.

762
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,014
Now, do as you promised.

763
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,940
And take us to your secret pathway.

764
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,711
- Fandral.
- Right.

765
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,420
For Asgard.

766
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,143
Nothing personal, boys.

767
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,819
Loki...

768
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,247
if it were easy, everyone would do it.

769
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,324
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

770
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,516
Ta-da!

771
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,400
We must strike now.

772
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,436
No.

773
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:33,694
Asgard is meaningless.

774
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,828
The Aether has found its way home.

775
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,094
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

776
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,851
It would consume you.

777
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,398
She's holding up all right.

778
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,350
For now.

779
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,442
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

780
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,905
Say goodbye.

781
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,778
Not this day.

782
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,698
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

783
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,491
It's a heartbeat.

784
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,907
You'll never be ready.

785
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:22,844
The only woman
whose love you've prized

786
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,707
will be snatched from you.

787
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,083
And will that satisfy you?

788
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,751
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

789
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,049
Surrender is not in mine.

790
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,335
- The son of Odin...
- No.

791
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,466
Not just of Odin.

792
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,931
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

793
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,092
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

794
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,514
Trust?

795
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,929
Was that her last expression?

796
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,773
Trust? When you let her die?

797
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,609
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

798
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,107
Who put me there?

799
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,229
You know damn well!

800
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,690
- You know damn well who!

801
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,620
She wouldn't want us to fight.

802
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,290
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

803
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,501
I wish I could trust you.

804
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,983
Trust my rage.

805
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,528
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

806
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,366
What?

807
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,830
Oh, yeah.

808
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,909
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

809
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,996
One man's leather wallet, brown.

810
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,548
One key ring, three keys.

811
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,588
Prescription medicine...

812
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,586
Various.

813
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,007
- And...
- Erik.

814
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,014
- These.
- Yeah.

815
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,310
Those.

816
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,100
Thank goodness.

817
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,982
Erik.

818
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,894
Yes?

819
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,692
It's, uh, Darcy.

820
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,904
Darcy.

821
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,905
So good to see you.

822
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,073
Oh, I missed you, too.

823
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,616
How did you find me?

824
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:23,947
You were naked on TV.

825
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,451
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

826
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,537
Getting weird now.

827
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,083
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

828
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:39,054
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

829
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,132
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.

830
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,471
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

831
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:46,811
Are you all right?

832
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,812
I've had a god in my brain.

833
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,607
- I don't recommend it.

834
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,524
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

835
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,981
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

836
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,774
Wait. What's happening?

837
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,742
Birds?

838
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,239
Birds are happening?

839
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,575
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

840
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,914
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

841
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:12,579
- Nerd.
- Look!

842
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,339
Where did they go?

843
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,437
What the hell was that?

844
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,607
Why are you smiling?

845
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,009
There's nothing more reassuring

846
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:41,783
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

847
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,737
Take me to Jane's lab.

848
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,674
Jane.

849
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,641
Malekith.

850
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,828
All right. Are you ready?

851
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,242
I am.

852
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,882
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

853
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,884
Yes, possibly.

854
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,873
You still don't trust me, brother?

855
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,646
Would you?

856
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,784
No, I wouldn't.

857
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,041
Thor!

858
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,460
No!

859
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:28,222
You really think I cared about Frigga?

860
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,015
About any of you?

861
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,011
All I ever wanted

862
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:36,560
was you and Odin

863
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:37,773
dead at my feet!

864
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,404
Malekith!

865
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,491
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

866
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,581
and I bring you a gift.

867
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:01,380
I ask only one thing in return...

868
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,879
A good seat from which
to watch Asgard burn.

869
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,754
He is an enemy of Asgard.

870
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,590
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

871
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:25,938
Look at me.

872
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,456
Loki! Now!

873
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,087
Ah!

874
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,301
Ah!

875
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,911
- Ah!
- No!

876
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,289
See you in hell, monster.

877
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,609
No. No, no, no.

878
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:18,189
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

879
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:19,273
I know...

880
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,489
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

881
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:23,740
Stay with me, okay?

882
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,991
I'm sorry.

883
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:29,250
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...

884
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,663
It's okay.

885
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,790
It's all right.

886
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:39,418
I'll tell Father what you did here today.

887
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,428
I didn't do it for him.

888
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,352
No!

889
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,203
He's going to unleash it.

890
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:57,501
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

891
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:58,747
How?

892
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,004
Jane, how?

893
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,345
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

894
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,297
The Convergence.

895
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,635
Oh, God.

896
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:10,154
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

897
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,678
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it

898
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,476
that much sooner.

899
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:17,024
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

900
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:18,893
Jane...

901
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,237
Now we're trapped here.

902
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:29,994
It's not me.

903
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,497
Hello?

904
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,831
<i>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</i>

905
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:35,743
Richard? Where are you?

906
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,085
I'm still at the office.

907
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,170
It's been a crazy day here today.

908
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,169
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
<i>- Is it?</i>

909
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,507
<i>I quite enjoyed our lunch</i>

910
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,677
despite never actually
ordering anything.

911
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,173
How am I getting service here?

912
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,381
<i>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</i>

913
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,679
No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.

914
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:53,677
Okay, then.

915
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,138
<i>I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</i>

916
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,689
<i>Uh, maybe dinner next time.</i>

917
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,391
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

918
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,769
<i>- Just stay on the phone, okay?</i>
- Yeah, I will.

919
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,862
Oh, my God.

920
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:08,854
Am I interrupting something?

921
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,619
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

922
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:11,778
Come on.

923
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:12,954
<i>I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</i>

924
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,535
Where are we going?

925
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:15,616
<i>Hello?</i>

926
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,584
Why are there so many shoes in here?

927
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,004
I'll just text her.

928
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,472
So, who's Richard?

929
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,103
Really?

930
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,904
- Jane!
- Hey.

931
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,731
You can't just leave like that.

932
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:49,111
The whole world is going crazy.

933
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,117
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

934
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,454
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

935
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:58,246
Jane! How wonderful.

936
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,164
Oh!

937
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,332
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

938
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,164
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.

939
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,882
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

940
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,677
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

941
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:09,966
Okay.

942
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,139
- Are you well, Erik?

943
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,091
Your brother's not coming, is he?

944
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,435
Loki is dead.

945
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:17,602
Oh, thank God!

946
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,981
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.

947
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,645
Thank you.

948
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,125
Forgive me, my liege.

949
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,462
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

950
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,014
Thor?

951
01:24:55,674 --> 01:25:00,100
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

952
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,147
What?

953
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,728
We found a body.

954
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,567
Loki.

955
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:19,497
Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot

956
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:21,579
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

957
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,169
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

958
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,666
For each additional world,

959
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,881
the power will increase exponentially.

960
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:31,044
The effect would be universal.

961
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,795
But the Alignment is only temporary.

962
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,927
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.

963
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,721
Well, how do we know where that is?

964
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:41,348
We follow the directions.

965
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,763
This has happened before

966
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,233
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.

967
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,269
All the great constructions,

968
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,821
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

969
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:55,322
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

970
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,494
And they left us a map.

971
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:58,991
Stonehenge,

972
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,494
Snowdon,

973
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:02,745
the Great Orme.

974
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,701
These are all coordinates taking us...

975
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,079
Here.

976
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,049
Greenwich?

977
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,752
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

978
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,240
Physics is going to go ballistic.

979
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,138
Increases and decreases in gravity,

980
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,723
spatial extrusions.

981
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:21,427
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

982
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,933
I better get my pants.

983
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,860
Focus! This is important.

984
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,486
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

985
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,901
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.

986
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,699
They're taped together.

987
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:38,197
Do you even know
what these things do?

988
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,195
Uh... No.

989
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:41,530
Neither do I.

990
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,627
Shh!

991
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,332
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

992
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,138
Holy...

993
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:07,264
Shit.

994
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:20,777
Ah!

995
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,099
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

996
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,439
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

997
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,057
Not by your hand.

998
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,893
Your universe was never meant to be.

999
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:38,071
Your world and your family

1000
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,274
will be extinguished!

1001
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:43,906
We're running out of time.

1002
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,371
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

1003
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:49,040
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

1004
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:51,167
Oh, come on.

1005
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,542
Come on, Darcy.

1006
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:10,937
You know, with all that power,

1007
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,556
I thought you'd hit harder.

1008
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,048
Done.

1009
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:48,683
The Convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.

1010
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,001
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

1011
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,352
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

1012
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:06,402
That is awesome!

1013
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:07,986
<i>How did you do that?</i>

1014
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,366
Well, the gravitational fields

1015
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,744
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

1016
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,245
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!

1017
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,538
- Oops.
- Let's go.

1018
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,085
Um...

1019
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,171
- What the hell just happened?

1020
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,961
Move!

1021
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,067
What are you all doing?

1022
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:44,861
You need to get out of here, now!

1023
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,528
You're joking, right?

1024
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:47,617
That's Thor out there.

1025
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,820
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

1026
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:50,130
Ah!

1027
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,691
Confirming ship is hostile.

1028
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,735
<i>Confirmed, ship is hostile.</i>

1029
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:13,240
<i>You have permission to engage.</i>

1030
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:14,536
<i>Roger.</i>

1031
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:15,738
<i>Missiles locked.</i>

1032
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:18,325
<i>Missiles away.</i>

1033
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,956
<i>Missiles off target.</i>

1034
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,755
<i>I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</i>

1035
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:26,629
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
Lost positive control.</i>

1036
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:29,753
What are you doing?

1037
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,338
My signal's not connecting.

1038
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:34,632
Jane!

1039
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:35,808
Come on.

1040
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,390
Are you all right?

1041
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:20,553
You saved my life.

1042
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:25,183
Yeah.

1043
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,563
I guess I did.

1044
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,360
Mmm.

1045
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:36,736
Darcy?

1046
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,071
- Jane!

1047
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:40,498
- Ian!
- Selvig!

1048
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:42,204
Mew mew!

1049
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,706
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1050
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:50,998
How do I get to Greenwich?

1051
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,045
Take this train. Three stops.

1052
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,634
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1053
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,520
Sorry. Sorry.

1054
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,681
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

1055
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:43,928
Jane!

1056
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,293
Thor!

1057
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,337
We're too late.

1058
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,803
The Convergence is at its peak.

1059
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,796
Can those things stop him?

1060
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,014
Not from here.

1061
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,972
We can't get close enough.

1062
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,262
Loan.

1063
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:51,579
Malekith!

1064
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:02,216
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1065
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:05,640
Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?

1066
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,766
I've come to accept your surrender.

1067
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,417
You think you can stop this?

1068
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,917
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1069
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,710
But you can.

1070
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,253
Thor! No.

1071
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:33,644
Jane!

1072
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:56,204
Ah!

1073
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:05,930
Everybody okay?

1074
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:52,431
He's gonna come back.

1075
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,806
Except, you know.

1076
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:59,104
Last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

1077
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,106
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1078
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,863
Did he say anything before he left?

1079
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:07,154
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

1080
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:11,363
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1081
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,247
Oh.

1082
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:24,547
<i>You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.</i>

1083
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:25,710
<i>You were wrong.</i>

1084
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:30,174
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1085
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:33,385
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

1086
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:38,477
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1087
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,517
My life.

1088
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:45,362
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

1089
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:50,239
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

1090
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:52,612
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1091
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:56,867
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1092
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,541
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1093
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,171
it changes you.

1094
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,671
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1095
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:11,051
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1096
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,679
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

1097
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:18,225
This is not for Jane, Father.

1098
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,727
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1099
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:24,151
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

1100
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:25,611
It changes nothing.

1101
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:29,532
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

1102
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:32,569
another who will not take it.

1103
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,862
Is this my legacy?

1104
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,622
Loki died with honor.

1105
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:38,950
I shall try to live the same.

1106
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,455
Is that not legacy enough?

1107
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:53,806
It belongs to you.

1108
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:56,301
If you are worthy of it.

1109
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,887
I shall try to be.

1110
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:05,026
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1111
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,650
I know.

1112
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,826
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1113
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,662
even that, I could not say.

1114
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:22,786
It would speak only from my heart.

1115
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,583
Go.

1116
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,166
My son.

1117
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:31,545
Thank you, Father.

1118
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:48,190
No.

1119
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,193
Thank you.

1120
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,624
I present to you,

1121
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:15,833
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1122
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:18,506
Whoa...

1123
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:26,140
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1124
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:31,941
You know why we're here.

1125
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,567
Of course.

1126
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:40,650
But, if I may ask,

1127
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:44,696
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1128
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,744
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1129
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:51,415
It is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.

1130
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:54,539
That's very wise.

1131
01:45:04,381 --> 01:45:05,758
I can assure you,

1132
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:12,231
it will be absolutely safe here,

1133
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:16,936
in my collection.

1134
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:20,526
See that it is.

1135
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,586
One down.

1136
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,590
Five to go.
