1
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,464
"Something there is in
the float of the sight of things

2
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,598
"That provokes it
out of the soul

3
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:42,035
"Now I re-examine
philosophies and religions

4
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,972
"They may prove well in
lecture-rooms

5
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:49,076
"yet not prove at all under the
spacious clouds and along the landscape

6
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,245
"and flowing currents."

7
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:55,683
I think Walt Whitman's trying to tell us
something here, like maybe we should hold our

8
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:59,620
class outdoors, or maybe we shouldn't
hold it at all.

9
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:03,957
Now before we get into
the elegy on Lincoln,

10
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:08,729
I thought it might be a good
idea for us to first review

11
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,700
a little bit of the activity that Mr.
Whitman was up to during the Civil War.

12
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,869
Yeah. Professor Beckwith, didn't
he try to buy his brother out

13
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,805
of serving in the army?

14
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,041
Yeah, and wasn't his older brother,
George, wounded during the war?

15
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,777
Yeah, George was wounded at Fredericksburg,
that's why he went to Washington…

16
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,013
I think that might be a little
bit of a cop-out then…

17
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,250
He's obviously an egomaniac. He wrote
his own reviews for crying out loud.

18
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,354
Wait a minute, calm down.
Just a minute.

19
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,389
Now, I find this really
fascinating,

20
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,359
that here we are,
fighting amongst ourselves,

21
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,127
and defending
one position and another

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,463
on the man's personal life!

23
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,633
And not a word, not one
phrase, not one reference,

24
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,201
to any individual work
that he did.

25
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:52,240
The important thing is what the man stood
for, and that's reflected in his work.

26
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,207
Daddy!
Hello, darling.

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,677
Climb up here and give
Daddy a kiss.

28
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,546
That a girl. Boy, you're
getting heavy.

29
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,382
You make your dentist
appointment today?

30
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,349
Yep.
Let's have a look.

31
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,051
Very good, then.
Guess what?

32
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,787
What? Jessica
kissed a boy today.

33
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,154
Uh-oh.

34
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,890
Really? All of them are? Everyone?
I just hate them.

35
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,325
Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,859
Hello, darling.
Hello, sweetheart.

37
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,696
How are you, Jess?
Hi, Dad, I'm fine.

38
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,097
What are you guys talking about?

39
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,634
Oh, Jessie was lamenting the quality
of the opposite sex at school.

40
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,170
Well, lack of it, actually. Oh, yeah?
That's not what I heard, red.

41
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,039
Oh, and by the way, I found this
bag of trash in the living room.

42
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,375
Where should I put it? Down the drain.
Like that one.

43
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,812
What's for supper?

44
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:09,283
We are having hamburger with blue
cheese from The New York Times.

45
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,218
Mom, it's a 60-minute gourmet…

46
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,753
Where's Paula? What are
you doing under there?

47
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,556
Daddy.

48
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,025
…two tablespoons,
you need to chop this…

49
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,695
Do you want a glass of wine?
I would love that.

50
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,666
Okay, I need… PAULA:
I'll have what I want.

51
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,868
How'd it go with Larry, honey?

52
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,871
Well, the university board is determined
to cut down my Humanities department.

53
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:31,839
What does that mean?

54
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,642
It means they wanna drop
nine of our people.

55
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:39,613
What? You're kidding.
Nine? Oh, for God's sake.

56
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,115
That's what I said.
What are you going to do?

57
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,885
Try and set up a meeting tomorrow night
with some of the other chairmen.

58
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,455
You know who could help you? Steve Nichols.
I already thought of that.

59
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,589
His wife is one of the trustees.

60
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,490
We'll need all the help
we can get.

61
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,392
I'm sorry. God.

62
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,026
Oh, no, it's not me,
it's our friends.

63
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,228
I know, but it's awful.

64
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,998
Come on, guys,
cut it out, will you, please?

65
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,835
It's not fair, Mom! Oh, shut up…

66
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,170
Now, listen, I've got some
good news for you, at least.

67
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,805
What's up?

68
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,541
We nailed Gavin Wilson's new
book for the university press!

69
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,277
Hey! Congratulations.

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,779
That's a real coup, isn't it?

71
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,814
Oh, God, was I relieved.
Good for you.

72
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,649
Butter, please.

73
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,989
Did Mom tell you about my plan?

74
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,257
What plan?

75
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,026
About Europe.
What about it?

76
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,396
I'd like to go.
I'm sure you would someday.

77
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,864
I mean this summer. You know,
one of Garber's teenage tours.

78
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,100
She's not a teenager yet.

79
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,936
Oh, Daddy, don't be punctilious.
I'm old enough to go.

80
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,405
You're only 12 and a half.

81
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,706
Shut up, birdbrain.

82
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,774
Come on, you guys.

83
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,943
What's your rush, Jessica? Why
can't you wait another year?

84
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,313
I refuse to spend another boring
summer with Grandma in her…

85
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,848
…Cape Cod.

86
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,450
Bourgeois Cape Cod?

87
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,486
Yeah. So what if there's
nuclear war?

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,889
I could die without ever
seeing the Louvre.

89
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,959
Why don't you write a letter to
the President and the politburo,

90
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,662
and maybe they'll make an extra effort
to keep things quiet for another year.

91
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,063
Daddy, you're not
taking me seriously.

92
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,098
Daddy's saying no.

93
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:05,999
No, he isn't.

94
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,635
He hasn't said yes.

95
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,603
He's saying maybe.
Meaning?

96
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:12,205
Meaning I'll discuss it
with your mother.

97
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,676
I forgot to tell you Louis Montcourage
called today from France.

98
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,611
Really, what did he want?
Should I call him back?

99
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,012
No, no, he's on his way
to the country,

100
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,648
but he says he will call you
tomorrow at 4:00.

101
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,583
I said at school.
Our time.

102
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,821
Remember, you promised no lectures
this summer. Huh? Didn't he?

103
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,122
Yeah, you promised.

104
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,924
You promised.

105
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,427
I know that. Maybe I'm up
for a Legion of Honor.

106
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,730
If she goes to Europe,
can I go to Asia?

107
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,799
You're not going to go to Asia,
'cause you pick your nose.

108
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,501
What's wrong with that,
you never pick your nose?

109
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,570
No! That's a disgusting thing.
I do not pick my nose.

110
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,438
You mean you don't
get caught at it.

111
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,607
I think the picking of one's nose is
a good and healthy thing, don't you?

112
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,741
Would you like some cake?

113
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,448
Here you go, kid, take a break.

114
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,984
Oh, thanks, honey.

115
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,752
I got us all set up at Doug's
for tomorrow night at 6:30.

116
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,588
Yeah? 6:30,
what about dinner?

117
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,690
Cathy's going to make a buffet.

118
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:03,924
Oh, that's nice, it'll
be like a little party.

119
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,094
Let's hope it's not a going-away party.
Nah, come on.

120
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,999
How does Wilson read? God, he
is a good writer, you know,

121
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,468
but some of this prose has got more
starch in it than our laundry.

122
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,605
Well, if all those guys
wrote like Adlai Stevenson,

123
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,773
you'd be unemployed right now.
True.

124
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,778
Okay, just a minute. Look, I've got one
more paragraph, I've got to get…

125
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:28,181
Oh, what is she…
…finished. Oh, boy.

126
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,084
You know, I missed you today.

127
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,521
Did you?
What a coincidence.

128
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,896
I'm gonna have to drop the Shakespeare
course next term, Professor Beckwith.

129
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,898
Yeah, Professor Curtis told me that,
that's why I wanted to see you.

130
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,366
What is there,
a scheduling problem?

131
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,068
No, I'm a physics major.

132
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,670
Yeah, I know, but you were
a physics major

133
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,505
when you registered
for the course, right?

134
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,273
Yeah. To tell you the truth,

135
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,676
I don't want to have to compete
with mostly English majors.

136
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,010
Compete for what?

137
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,112
Grades. I've got
to be realistic.

138
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,014
If I'm going to land a job
in nuclear research,

139
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,616
I've got to have
a straight-A average.

140
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,252
Is there no other reason?

141
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,655
Look, I've always enjoyed the
little Shakespeare I've read,

142
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,557
that's why I considered
taking the course,

143
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,825
but I just afford to risk
a below-A grade.

144
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:14,662
Yeah, I understand.

145
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,967
Now tell me, just how much
Shakespeare have you read?

146
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,669
A little.

147
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,839
I played Horatio
in Hamlet in high school.

148
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,576
Did you?
Yes.

149
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,843
Did you retain any of the lines?

150
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,846
Yeah. No.

151
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,753
"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
a little ere the mightiest Julius fell,

152
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,123
"the graves stood tenantless

153
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,727
"and the sheeted dead did squeak and
gibber in the Roman streets as stars with

154
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,128
"trains of fire and dews
of blood."

155
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,134
That's all I can remember.

156
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,604
That's marvelous.

157
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,740
It's embarrassing I can't
remember anymore.

158
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,009
Not at all. You know what
I'm going to do, Mr. Ryan?

159
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,546
I'm going to guarantee you
an A in this course right now

160
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,883
if you'll simply promise to attend
it, relax and enjoy. How'd that be?

161
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:10,951
Are you serious?

162
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:11,785
I'm very serious.

163
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,987
What about Professor Curtis?

164
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,155
I'm just going to tell him
to give you an A.

165
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,659
Well, what excuse
would you make?

166
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,829
That I will personally feel a hell of a lot
safer knowing there's a physicist out there

167
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,530
who's read some Shakespeare.

168
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,666
Excuse me. And I
think you'll be happier, too.

169
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,467
- Hello.
- Professor Beckwith?

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,670
Yes, speaking. WOMAN: You
have a call from Paris.

171
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,771
All right, I'll hang on.

172
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,942
Simply the thing I am
shall make me live.

173
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,578
Shakespeare. Congratulations, you've
just got an A on your first test.

174
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,647
Thanks.

175
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,921
If I knew I was going to perform
Shakespeare, I would have worn my tights.

176
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,757
I'll tell Professor Curtis
to expect you.

177
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,192
Thanks. Thank you.
Good luck!

178
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,296
Hello?
Yes, hello!

179
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,767
Is that you, Bob?
Louis! Ca va?

180
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,835
Fine.

181
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,804
Good, good.
How is Simone?

182
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,006
Simone is well, thank you.

183
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,275
Louis?

184
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,643
I'm here.

185
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,211
Oh! I thought
we got cut off.

186
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,145
No.

187
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:17,617
Bob, do you remember
Nicole Guerin?

188
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,071
Hi, honey.

189
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,041
Hi.

190
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,209
Gosh, we're late, you know.

191
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,344
We're running behind.
I got behind.

192
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,079
How'd it go today?

193
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,413
Hmm?

194
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,549
Where are the kids?

195
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,185
They're having dinner with Stephanie.
Nora's going to bring them home later on.

196
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,220
You gonna change? Hmm?

197
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:28,956
No.

198
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,829
What's the matter?

199
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,706
Are you sick?
No.

200
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:49,877
A problem at school?

201
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,378
No.

202
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,916
Well, will you tell me? You're
scaring me, for God's sake.

203
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,317
Okay, relax.
What's the matter?

204
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,151
Please sit down.

205
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,288
What?
Um…

206
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,659
Do you remember the first time
I went to France alone?

207
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:09,763
You know, that time I went to
lecture on Baudelaire and Poe.

208
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:10,998
Well sort of. That's a
very long time ago…

209
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,833
It was 10 years ago. You
were pregnant with Paula.

210
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,367
Yeah, right, I remember.

211
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:17,771
I had an affair.

212
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,210
In France, 10 years ago?

213
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,380
Why are you telling me now?

214
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:29,917
Is this some sort of
a joke or something?

215
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,919
No, it's not joke.
It's the truth.

216
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,722
Is this somebody I know?

217
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,857
No.

218
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,158
Well, who was it?

219
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,361
Her name was Nicole Guerin.

220
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,764
She was the doctor
that looked after me.

221
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,636
Um, well, how long did it last?

222
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,704
I don't remember.
Two or three days.

223
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,506
Well, which was it,
two or three days?

224
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,042
Does it matter?

225
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,844
Yeah, actually,
everything matters.

226
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,346
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

227
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,249
Because I didn't want
to hurt you.

228
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,251
You want to hurt me now?

229
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,452
Good God, no, Sheila.

230
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,855
I mean…

231
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,990
Are you gonna run away with this
woman, is that what you're telling me?

232
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,659
No, I haven't seen her
in 10 years.

233
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,294
She was killed in an
accident a few days ago.

234
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,495
That's why Louis was calling.

235
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,998
I don't get this.

236
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,800
What…

237
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,469
You must have a reason
for telling me this now.

238
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:24,938
Yes, I do.

239
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,941
Darling, she had a son.

240
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah?

241
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,079
My son.

242
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,848
I'm the boy's father, Sheila.

243
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,826
Oh, Jesus.

244
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,469
What makes you
think that it's your son?

245
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,040
Louis was her closest friend.
He's absolutely certain.

246
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,608
I know that you're angry and
you have every right to be,

247
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,576
but it doesn't change the fact.

248
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,083
Why didn't he tell you before?

249
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,285
Because she made him
promise not to.

250
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,588
She knew I was married
and had kids.

251
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,393
Listen, Sheila,

252
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,896
if it's any consolation
to you, I swear to God,

253
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,966
it's the only time
I've ever been unfaithful.

254
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,902
I haven't seen her in 10 years. I
never wrote her or called her.

255
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,637
Had no contact whatsoever.

256
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,407
What else did Louis tell you?

257
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,613
That the boy has no other family, and
that he and Simone would look after him.

258
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,318
Good, they'll make
great parents.

259
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,120
Let's get out of here,
I'm getting out of here.

260
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,456
I'm the boy's father! I don't
want to hear about it!

261
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,376
I hope you started without us.

262
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,113
Did you think we'd start without
our best and our brightest?

263
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,881
Go on in.
Sheila!

264
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,750
Hello! Hi!
Nice to see you!

265
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,120
Could you help me with this? Hello, Betty.
How you doing?

266
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,322
Hi, Betty. How are you?

267
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,292
Robinson? Hi.
Hi.

268
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,627
What do you got? I need a drink.
I'd like a vodka, straight.

269
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,196
Please.

270
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,032
I don't think you've met
the Dolans.

271
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,433
Listen, I really appreciate
your help on this.

272
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,867
You got a problem?
We'll stick together.

273
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,736
Glass of wine?
No.

274
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,305
What's she having?
Vodka straight.

275
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll have the same, please.
Okay.

276
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,375
You know, I feel awful that we
haven't gotten together before this.

277
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,643
Oh, don't.

278
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,113
Maybe just not interested
in history.

279
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,948
Oh, no, no. I am.
Especially, uh, French.

280
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,618
Oh, thank you.

281
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,487
Uh, we have some distant
relatives in France.

282
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,956
Thanks.

283
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,858
Sheila!

284
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,094
Marsh! Marsh!

285
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,495
Congratulations!
Oh, thank you.

286
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,731
I hear you're editing
Gavin Wilson's new book.

287
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,865
Yes.

288
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,200
Hello, Bob!

289
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,902
This is our friend,
Marcia Whorl.

290
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,938
The Dolans.
Hi.

291
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,341
We played tennis two years ago.
Yeah.

292
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,043
Doubles, right? You lost.
Yeah.

293
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,580
The way I understand, what you're
looking for is a consensus, right?

294
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,981
Yeah, that's about it.

295
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,184
I'll tell you, if this were Cambridge
rather than here in Los Angeles,

296
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,918
we wouldn't be
having this problem.

297
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,788
Don't kid yourself, Richard, they
got the same problems at Cambridge.

298
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,158
They got the same problems in every
institute of higher learning

299
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,226
in this country, I promise you.

300
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,162
The way I see it,
we have two alternatives.

301
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,663
We're gonna have to capitulate

302
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,964
or we can threaten to resign.

303
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,700
I thought we were here to
save others' jobs, not to lose ours.

304
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,502
He's right. Then
I suggest we all leave.

305
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,670
Are you serious?

306
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,172
I'm very serious.

307
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,307
Because if we cave in now,
we're finished anyway.

308
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,975
They'll keep hacking away
at our departments

309
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,579
until this university won't have
a Humanities left in the end.

310
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,782
Gentlemen, couldn't we eat now and
save the Humanities after dinner?

311
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,350
Hear, hear!

312
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,592
What's his name?

313
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,327
Who?

314
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,230
Your son.

315
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,666
Jean-Claude.

316
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,943
I just wish I could
make this up to you.

317
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,312
I don't think you can.

318
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,254
Hey, come on, hon.

319
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,456
You're not gonna let this shatter
our whole relationship, are you?

320
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,191
I don't know.

321
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,392
I don't know anything anymore.

322
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,729
Christ, I wish
I hadn't told you.

323
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,832
Why did you tell me, Robert?

324
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,767
I don't know.

325
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,837
You do, God damn it, you do.
It's the child.

326
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,105
You didn't want it.

327
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,506
You certainly
didn't plan for it,

328
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,676
but now that you've got it, you
feel responsible, don't you?

329
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,686
I just feel I ought
to do something.

330
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,655
You're not his parent because
you screwed his mother.

331
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,657
I know that, Sheila.

332
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,762
I just think I should go over
there and see him. Talk to him.

333
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,897
And say what?

334
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,932
I don't know.

335
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,969
Let him know there's somebody else in the
world that cares about him, I guess.

336
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,305
I don't want you going. I don't
want you going back to France now.

337
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,775
I've gotta go, Sheila.
There's no other way.

338
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,446
Yes, there is.
You could bring him here.

339
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,149
What do you mean?

340
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,354
Let him spend
Easter vacation with us.

341
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,424
Do you know what you're saying?

342
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,361
It isn't generosity, Robert.

343
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,197
It's self-defense.

344
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,866
If I don't let you get this out
of your system sooner or later,

345
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,603
you'll blame me for something or
other having to do with your son.

346
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,372
I wouldn't do that, Sheila.

347
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:00,773
Oh, yes, you would.
You would.

348
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,718
Maybe you're right.

349
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,489
I'll bring him over, then.

350
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,962
It's an extraordinary offer. I
really appreciate it, Sheila.

351
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,765
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't talk about it anymore.

352
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,805
We're going to have to manufacture
something to tell the girls.

353
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,574
I don't like the idea
of lying to them.

354
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,713
Should have thought of that
10 years ago.

355
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,692
You look awful, Daddy.

356
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,465
Yeah, well, I just found out
a friend of mine died.

357
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,800
What friend?

358
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,935
Oh, you never met her.

359
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,106
How come?
If she's a friend…

360
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,575
Well, she lived in France.

361
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,209
I didn't know her either, honey.

362
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,945
Daddy meets a lot of
people when he lectures.

363
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,349
I'm sorry she died.

364
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,451
I am, too.

365
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,589
She had a son.

366
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,956
How old?

367
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,460
Roughly about Paula's age,
I guess.

368
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,698
And, now he's an orphan.

369
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,003
Your mother and I
were thinking that

370
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,906
it'd be a good idea for us to invite him
over here to spend Easter vacation with us.

371
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,007
What do you think?

372
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,775
Sure, it's fine with me.

373
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,976
Good idea.

374
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,211
What's his name?

375
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,846
Jean-Claude.

376
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,981
Jean-Claude Guerin.

377
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,417
Does he speak English?

378
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,485
I don't know.

379
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,653
I hope so.

380
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:58,090
Sounds like I'll be able to…

381
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,459
To prepare for the summer.

382
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,861
We haven't decided
on that yet, young lady.

383
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:02,995
Take your vitamins. Come on.

384
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,367
Is he cute, Daddy?

385
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,835
I don't know that either,
I've never seen him.

386
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,616
Hi, could you tell me what time Flight
891 gets in from Paris, please?

387
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,752
891 from Paris?

388
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,990
891 will arrive
on time at 4:15.

389
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,592
4:15?
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,093
So I'm an hour early.
Mmm-hmm.

391
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,962
And where will it come in?

392
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,130
You can meet the passengers
in the customs area upstairs.

393
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:39,499
Oh, okay. Thanks a lot.

394
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,467
You're welcome.
Thank you.

395
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,481
What could be more appropriate?

396
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:32,819
Baudelaire knew France and the French
character better than most of our poets.

397
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,621
Your lecture was magnifique.

398
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,789
A day the Sorbonne
will never forget.

399
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,591
I wish you'd gone on
for another hour.

400
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,260
The faculty loved it.

401
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,432
Boy, I'll tell you, Louis, you are
one charming Gallic bullshitter.

402
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,999
No, I'm serious.

403
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,002
Watch out, Louis!

404
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,375
Oh, my God!

405
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,244
Are you all right, Bobby?

406
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,679
Oh, my God, you're hurt.

407
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,581
I must get you to a doctor.

408
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,493
Look up, please.

409
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,505
May I ask what you're doing now?

410
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,608
Just checking
your pupillary reflexes.

411
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,145
It's good of you to see
my colleague, Nicole.

412
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,948
No thanks are necessary.

413
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:36,816
It's my job.

414
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,752
Am I gonna live, doctor?

415
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:43,322
A rule about accident victims is

416
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:47,426
if they can ask silly questions,
then it's not too serious.

417
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,028
Thank God, I can take him home.

418
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,564
Simone will be delighted.

419
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,635
Louis, I think
Professor Beckwith

420
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,104
should stay a while so that
I can take some X-rays.

421
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,973
X-rays? Oh, my God.

422
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,676
He wouldn't be here if I hadn't
persuaded him to come and lecture.

423
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,178
Louis, one patient
at a time is enough.

424
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,014
Now, you go home

425
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,149
and I'll bring him when we
have finished, all right?

426
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,350
Maybe I should stay.

427
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,019
No, no, no.
Don't keep Simone waiting.

428
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,453
I'll be all right.

429
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,623
Look, Bobby, you don't have
to worry about a thing.

430
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:17,924
You couldn't be in better hands.

431
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,627
Nicole is the best doctor
in all of Normandy.

432
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,362
Don't forget, he has to be
in shape for my seminar

433
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,430
at the Sorbonne on Tuesday.

434
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,532
No problems.

435
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,801
If necessary, I will give
him a brain transplant.

436
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,004
Hey, it's your jacket.

437
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,741
Oh…

438
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:38,678
See you later, Bobby.

439
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,517
Poor guy is a nervous wreck.

440
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,655
He's a very special person.

441
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,189
Yes, he is.

442
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,290
Take this, please.

443
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,358
What are they?

444
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,693
Aspirin.

445
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,628
Oh, yes. Now I know
you're a real doctor.

446
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,834
Are my brains still intact?

447
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,236
I'm not a psychiatrist.

448
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,173
But I don't see
any signs of fracture.

449
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,843
As you say in America,
you just shook up.

450
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,046
Where did you learn
your English?

451
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,917
I did a year internship
at Boston General.

452
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,086
I almost stayed on.

453
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,722
What brought you back?

454
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,191
Honfleur.

455
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,192
Do you know it?

456
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,194
No.

457
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,930
All I've seen in France so far
is the inside of a lecture hall.

458
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,734
Then you'll go back
to Los Angeles without

459
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,535
experiencing the lovely village

460
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,638
where Baudelaire
wrote Le Voyage?

461
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,439
I'm afraid so.

462
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,874
I can't allow that.

463
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,558
Now I understand why so many
impressionists came here to paint.

464
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:00,660
Yes.

465
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:04,597
It took only one year
working in a Paris clinic

466
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:08,567
to convince me that
this is where I belong.

467
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,138
You seem very happy here.

468
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,107
Since I live
by my own definitions,

469
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,977
I can say
I'm a very happy woman.

470
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,947
What is that song?

471
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,149
It's called Plaisirs d'Amour.

472
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,619
It's a lovely old song.

473
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,355
Maybe as old as this village.

474
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,894
It's about the joy
and sorrow of love.

475
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,292
What is your favorite
poem by Baudelaire?

476
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,728
Les Fleurs du Mal.

477
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,099
What do you like most
about Baudelaire's work?

478
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,668
Love.
Mmm.

479
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,071
Ah, oui.
The hopeless romantic.

480
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,006
But he never surrendered to it.

481
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,076
He believed that
no human relations

482
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,746
are adequate to human desires.

483
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,950
You ever been married?

484
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:04,851
No.

485
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,453
I don't think marriage
is for everyone.

486
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,658
I enjoy being independent
too much.

487
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,094
That doesn't mean
necessarily being lonely.

488
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,432
What about your family?

489
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,702
I lost my family
when I was little.

490
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,905
Louis and Simone
practically raised me.

491
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:32,578
Now I can understand the
importance of your independence.

492
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,280
Now who's playing doctor?

493
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,286
Actually, you may be right.

494
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,455
I have a tendency to use my
studies and my patients as…

495
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,928
As a shield against
personal relationships?

496
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,930
Perhaps.

497
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,133
That could change.

498
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:59,038
I mean, someday you
might even want children.

499
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,706
Oh, but I've thought of it.

500
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,941
And I will.

501
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,178
If I find somebody I like
enough to make a child with.

502
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,222
Come on, come on, quick.

503
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:27,967
Oh!

504
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,041
God, the water looks inviting.

505
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,508
It does.

506
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,247
Why don't we go for a swim?

507
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,921
You mean now?

508
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,589
Yes.

509
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,147
Flight 891 from
Paris is now arriving at Gate 35.

510
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,050
Incoming passengers may be
met at the customs area.

511
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,179
Mr. Collins?

512
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:27,753
Mr. Collins, Mr. Collins?
Excuse me, pardon me.

513
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,721
Tommy, how are ya?

514
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:30,923
How was he?
He's a wonderful boy.

515
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,624
Was he? Good, thank
you very much.

516
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:40,399
Joanne Hall, please pick up
the white courtesy phone. Joanne Hall.

517
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,504
Professor Beckwith?

518
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,210
Professor Beckwith?

519
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:59,518
Professor Beckwith?
Here.

520
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,292
Here's your little passenger.

521
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:10,229
Bonjour, Jean-Claude,
je suis Bob Beckwith.

522
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,238
Au revoir.

523
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,241
He was a very good passenger.

524
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,410
Merci, Madame, merci beaucoup.
You are very welcome.

525
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,645
Au revoir, Madame.
Au revoir.

526
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:33,952
Do you prefer parler
francais ou anglais?

527
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,455
Whatever you like.

528
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:42,094
Well, I'm sure you speak English
better than I speak French,

529
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,530
so we'll speak English, okay?
All right.

530
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,636
I'm very sorry to hear
about your mother.

531
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,239
Thank you.

532
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,044
Is this all your luggage?

533
00:32:58,744 --> 00:32:59,645
Yes.

534
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,415
Should we go?

535
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,761
So, welcome to America.
Thank you.

536
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:19,331
How are Louis and Simone?

537
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,733
Very well, Monsieur Beckwith.
Why don't you just call me Bob?

538
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,735
All right, Bob.

539
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,875
You take this.
You take Fuzzy Wuzzy.

540
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,611
I'm not taking the rat!
Fuzzy Wuzzy's not a rat,

541
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,646
he's a hamster!

542
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,483
Well, whatever he is, he's
sleeping by your side of the bed.

543
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,252
Why do I have to move,
and not Jessie?

544
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:42,020
Well, Mom, I don't
want her in my room.

545
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,056
Will you stop being so selfish?
It's for two weeks.

546
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,225
Come on, remember,
he's an orphan.

547
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,227
Is he gonna feel better in my
room than Jessie's?

548
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,097
It's easier to move you.

549
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,133
Yeah, because I have less things,
because Jessie gets everything…

550
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,668
Come on…

551
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:29,635
Jean-Claude.

552
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,405
Jean-Claude.

553
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:35,707
We're here.

554
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,680
Ladies, may I
present Jean-Claude Guerin.

555
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,249
Jean-Claude,
this is my wife, Sheila.

556
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:47,286
My daughters, Jessica and Paula.

557
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,255
Hi.

558
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,857
Hello.

559
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,862
Jean-Claude, we're very
happy to have you with us.

560
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,498
I'm happy to be here.

561
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,433
Good.

562
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,470
Jean-Claude, je suis Jessica.

563
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,813
What? I think he said
you're blue in the face.

564
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,383
Your French is excellent.

565
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,153
Really, vraiment?
Absolument.

566
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,991
How long did it take from Paris?

567
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,759
It was 10 hours.

568
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,497
Wow.
Oh, I have something.

569
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:39,905
Ah! Thank you!

570
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,609
Oh, look girls. See?
That's hand written.

571
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,978
It was given
to my mother by a patient.

572
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:50,416
That's very kind of you, Jean-Claude.
You must be very tired.

573
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,750
Yeah, he fell asleep in the car.

574
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,319
Come on, Jean-Claude.
I'll take you to your room.

575
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,422
Good night.
I'll do it. Huh?

576
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:58,324
Okay?

577
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,792
Goodnight

578
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,868
He's cute.
You think?

579
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,506
Why's his English so good? He
told me he had a private tutor.

580
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:16,675
Why, is he noble or something?

581
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,678
No. In fact, his mother
was a country doctor.

582
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,380
Wow.

583
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,581
What was his father?

584
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,852
I don't know, but I
know he wasn't noble.

585
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,255
Now, if you'll give me your
key, I'll unpack for you.

586
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,924
No, thank you,
I can do it myself.

587
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,494
Well, um…

588
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,265
All of these drawers
are empty here.

589
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,835
This is the bathroom. You'll have
to share that with the girls.

590
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,703
Thank you.

591
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,521
I can't sleep without Hippo.

592
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,562
Do you like him? Yes, I
have a whale like that.

593
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,566
I'll show you later.
That's neat.

594
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,536
Come, Jean-Claude is tired.

595
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,807
If you need anything else, we'll
be downstairs, all right?

596
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,812
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

597
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:47,699
Who's there?

598
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,574
Jean-Claude, what are you
doing down here?

599
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,379
Couldn't sleep, huh?
No.

600
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,749
May I join you?
That's fine.

601
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,991
Are you cold?
No.

602
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,795
You want a glass of milk
or something?

603
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,544
You're very homesick,
aren't you?

604
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,784
You come from a lovely
village, you know.

605
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,388
Do you know it?
Yes.

606
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,056
I was there once,
many years ago.

607
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,795
Is that where you met my mother?
Yes.

608
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,332
She was a very nice lady.

609
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,935
She was a very good doctor.
Yes, I know that.

610
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,739
Did you know my father?

611
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:04,876
Did you, Bob?

612
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,549
What did your mother
tell you about him?

613
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,421
That he was married
to someone else.

614
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:18,690
And?

615
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,860
They loved each other

616
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,362
and decided to have me.

617
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,900
But of course, he could
not stay in France.

618
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,109
Did, uh, your mother ever
tell you who he was?

619
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:41,447
No,

620
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,718
but I think perhaps
it was an Englishman.

621
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,988
Why do you think that?

622
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,860
Because if he was Italian,

623
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:59,498
I think she would have
made me learn Italian.

624
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:03,769
I think you're right.

625
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:07,739
Jean-Claude…

626
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,779
You just suffered
a very great loss,

627
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,416
and you have
a very, very deep pain.

628
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,587
But I want you to know
you're not alone.

629
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,557
You have Louis and Simone
in France,

630
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:30,896
and you have me, here.

631
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,636
I want you to know that
you can always count on me,

632
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,941
and I want us to be friends.

633
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,045
I think I'm sleepy now.

634
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,080
Magnifique, very good.

635
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:31,757
Pardon, I prefer coffee.

636
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,424
Really?

637
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,561
Oh, of course.
I should have asked.

638
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,195
I'll have some coffee, too.
Me, too.

639
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,131
No, you won't.
Why not?

640
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,735
Because I don't approve
of children having coffee.

641
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,271
But his mother was a doctor.
I know.

642
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,107
It's an honest
difference of opinion.

643
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,277
Why don't you just give
him some coffee, Sheila?

644
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,113
That's why I stood up,
Robert, to get him a cup.

645
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,625
I still don't know why
I can't have any coffee.

646
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:07,893
Because I said no.

647
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:11,730
And he can because
his mother said yes.

648
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,402
What would you like in it,
Jean-Claude?

649
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,737
It's all right,
I'll have the milk.

650
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,447
Okay,

651
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,282
okay, okay, okay.

652
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,956
You're gonna like our friend Bernie.
He's a lot of fun.

653
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,125
Bernie Edwards
is a crashing bore.

654
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,393
Come on, Jessica.
He's my oldest friend.

655
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,196
All he ever talks about is sports,
and how great his son Davey is.

656
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,666
So he's a sports man?

657
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,401
No, no, he's a lawyer, but most of
his clients are big-league athletes.

658
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:52,604
You know, like baseball,
basketball, football.

659
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,205
Football?

660
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,942
The American version
of breaking empty heads.

661
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,778
Anyway, he has this big barbeque
every year around Easter time.

662
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:00,912
That's where we're going.

663
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,750
One on one, Richard.
George, let me see your dunk.

664
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,752
Let me see your dunk.

665
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,720
Okay, let him shoot,
let him shoot.

666
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:10,756
All right, that's it, that's it.

667
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,927
Hey, Barbara.
Hey, Barbara.

668
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,009
Come on, Christians,
let's meet the gladiators.

669
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,050
Hey, hey, hey, Bernie!
Let's see that ball.

670
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,787
Hey, right here! Whoa.

671
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,855
Homer! Try and stop this.
Are you ready?

672
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,325
Get in there.
Whoo!

673
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,796
Give up? Homer, you might
make the team this year.

674
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:54,065
How are ya, Bernie?
Hey, Bob. How are ya?

675
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,566
Happy Easter.
Hey, same to you.

676
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,035
Hey, Uncle Bob!
Hey, Davey!

677
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:58,303
Oh, this is Jean-Claude Guerin.

678
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,438
Hey, the French kid you've
been talking about, right?

679
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,674
Yeah. Jean-Claude, this is
Bernie and his son, David.

680
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,542
Does he play any
touch football, Bob?

681
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,512
Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry Bernie,

682
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,648
but, you know, in some areas, the
French are culturally deprived.

683
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,050
Oh, yeah, I understand that.

684
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,020
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

685
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,290
Hey, Homer, teach
Jean-Claude how to play.

686
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,926
Hey, Ned. See you
later, Jean-Claude.

687
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,260
Easy.

688
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:27,232
I'm telling you, there are some All-Americans
down there. Did you see Davey?

689
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:29,067
I mean, he was
playing with them, Bob.

690
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,468
Yeah, I saw him. Did you see
that 20-footer he made?

691
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,269
Uh-huh.
Huh?

692
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:36,074
So you've been giving the dean a little
trouble here this week, haven't you?

693
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,177
I'm doing my best.

694
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,212
Yeah, I know, Bob, but I
think you gotta understand,

695
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:43,949
see, this is recruiting week now.
We got some kids coming in here

696
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:47,252
that can pay your salary
for the next four years, okay?

697
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,320
I'm not worried about my salary,
I'm worried about what I teach.

698
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,255
Bob,

699
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,458
the university needs
a seven-foot center.

700
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,463
Well, with all this room,
Bernie, maybe you can grow one.

701
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,732
Hey, Nance.

702
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:02,768
Hi, can I steal her away?
Yeah, sure.

703
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,571
Champagne?
Yes, yes, I…

704
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:09,274
You know, you look terrific,
you lucky thing. Do I?

705
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:13,411
Yes, you do. Is it
overwork or the Scarsdale?

706
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:17,148
Honey, I keep telling ya, it's
in the genes. This I know.

707
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:18,449
Oh…

708
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:23,288
Sheila, do not leave without
signing that petition.

709
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:24,856
It's on Bernie's desk
in his study.

710
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,491
Okay, all right,
now what am I signing?

711
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:30,261
The seals again, they're being butchered
in Canada. It's easy to remember.

712
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:34,232
Easter time, it's the seals. Right,
right, Easter, the seals, okay.

713
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,902
Okay. I'm going to
say hello to Lorraine, honey.

714
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,870
See you later. Bye.
Have fun.

715
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,174
Lorraine!
Oh, hello, Sheila.

716
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,576
Oh, I got lipstick on you, sorry.
Oh, that's all right.

717
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,178
What are you two talking about?

718
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,114
Well, I've been
practicing my French.

719
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,149
This is an absolutely
charming child.

720
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,451
Isn't he?
I know, I know, but…

721
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,053
You know, actually, Lorraine,

722
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,256
I think Jean-Claude should
practice his English, don't you?

723
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:02,393
Jessie, so do you want to go to
the movies some day this week?

724
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,163
The name is Jessica and I
don't go out with juveniles.

725
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,900
I'm 14 months
older than you are.

726
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,937
Anyway, I'm just gonna be
a superstar athlete.

727
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,372
I couldn't care less.

728
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:18,844
What sport?
Soccer.

729
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:22,981
My dad says it's gonna be real big in the
'80s, and I can kick with both feet.

730
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:25,016
Not at the same time, I assume.

731
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,987
Very funny. So, uh, who's
that shrimp with you?

732
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,591
He's not a shrimp. His name is Jean-Claude.
Guest from France.

733
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,095
He comes from a very important family.
Big deal.

734
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,430
And I plan to return the visit
when I go to Europe this summer.

735
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,832
Are you really going?

736
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,335
What?
Look it up, stupid.

737
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,910
Dad. Daddy, are you all right?
Sorry, Mr. Beckwith.

738
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:30,181
Oh, Daddy.
Bob, are you okay?

739
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,617
Yeah, I twisted my knee. You'd
better bring in another guy, Bernie.

740
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,987
All right. Bob, ain't that
kid something, though, huh?

741
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:40,325
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, love.

742
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,559
Why don't you get me some ice?

743
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,228
Okay.

744
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:46,497
Is he allowed to do that, Bob?
No.

745
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,868
Oh, Dad. Daddy's all
right, sweetheart.

746
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,738
Aren't you glad I'm a professor

747
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:54,940
and not a professional
football player?

748
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:56,074
Down six points, let's go.

749
00:47:57,142 --> 00:48:01,379
How's your knee? ROBERT: Not bad.
In here, anyway.

750
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:06,651
Serves me right.
I'm not in shape.

751
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,921
Nobody's in shape for an insanely
competitive 15-year-old.

752
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,127
Do you think anybody
suspected today?

753
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,333
I don't know.

754
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:27,305
You know, people sense things.
I know I do.

755
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:31,509
I really couldn't care less.

756
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,445
Oh, you wouldn't have minded telling
everybody today, would you?

757
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:37,115
Why not? I'm not ashamed of it.
Hmm.

758
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,990
Tell me about her, Robert.

759
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,162
Come on, Sheila, she's dead
and gone, what's the point?

760
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:55,000
I wanna know.
I wanna hear about her.

761
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:58,936
I do, really, listen,
I can handle it. Trust me.

762
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,006
Just tell me about her.

763
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,774
I don't want
to hurt you, Sheila.

764
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:07,145
Oh, honey, you can't
hurt me. It's me.

765
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,048
It's Sheila. I'm a big girl.

766
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,583
Just tell me.

767
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,023
Why do you wanna know?

768
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:21,459
If I had an affair with someone and had a
child with them, wouldn't you wanna know?

769
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:22,593
Hmm?

770
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,164
Yeah, I guess I would.

771
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,533
Yeah, of course you would.

772
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:32,570
Come on, sweetheart, just feel
loose, get comfortable. Tell me.

773
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:34,705
Tell me about her. Trust me.

774
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,444
Well…

775
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,981
She was, uh… You know…

776
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,186
Very independent.

777
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:52,257
I would say uniquely independent.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

778
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,527
She lived by her own rules.
Yeah?

779
00:49:56,561 --> 00:50:01,066
She had integrity. Great integrity.
Uh-huh. Integrity.

780
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,740
I was alone in France.
It was a beautiful summer.

781
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,711
Beaches were gorgeous.

782
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,281
I wanna hear about her,
not a damn travelogue.

783
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,519
Just tell me, will you,
please? Come on.

784
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:27,292
I mean, what was
she like physically?

785
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:31,329
She was very attractive, Sheila.

786
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,231
Yeah?

787
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:35,766
Exciting?

788
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,036
Yes, she was beautiful, Sheila.

789
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,639
And a good body?

790
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,642
Yes, she was beautiful, Sheila.

791
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:49,046
Yeah? It was inferred.

792
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,983
She was fantastic, she was the most
incredible, gorgeous, voluptuous creature

793
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,319
I've ever seen in my life.

794
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:57,222
God damn it!

795
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:01,659
Yeah, that's why I went to
France and divorced you

796
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,661
10 years ago,
so I could be with her!

797
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,663
Well, she was
uniquely independent.

798
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,434
Yes. She was uniquely
independent!

799
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12,103
And don't forget about
her wonderful integrity.

800
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:15,740
Uniquely independent!
Great integrity!

801
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,143
Oh, shush. Be quiet. The
children, you'll wake them up.

802
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,713
"Trust me."

803
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,149
Shit.

804
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:30,087
He didn't tell me, Margo.
I mean what is that?

805
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,190
A marriage that has been
open and honest,

806
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,325
people who have been
as close as we are,

807
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,027
I really thought we had the best
marriage of anybody I knew.

808
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:41,266
You do.
Oh, yeah, we do, huh?

809
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:44,602
Look, I've been married
and divorced three times.

810
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:49,640
Nowadays, one affair in 10 years?
Why, that's absolute celibacy.

811
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:53,978
You know what I found out? I'm not a nowadays
person, Margo. I thought that I was.

812
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,581
You know what goes on out there?

813
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,817
I mean, I was a 22-year-old virgin
when I got married, for God's sake.

814
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,220
I was too, I think.

815
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:07,592
What do you mean, you think?
Well, all my sex has blurred.

816
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:13,298
I mean, I must have been a virgin at
some time. Why not when I got married?

817
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,933
I know I was a virgin for practically
a year before I got divorced,

818
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,403
that I know for sure!

819
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:23,408
Did I really think that we would go through
40 or 50 years of being completely

820
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,410
faithful to each other?
What's the matter with me?

821
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,415
I mean what a really modern woman would
say is this is none of my business…

822
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:32,583
I mean, it really has to…

823
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:35,620
Don't do this to yourself…
Or the marriage!

824
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:40,525
It was a funny time. You
were pregnant, he was away.

825
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,126
He was in France,
for heaven's sake.

826
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,162
I mean, the wine, the romance.

827
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,898
I know, the beaches, the moon, don't
give me a travelogue, please.

828
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,868
All he did was have an affair.
That's all that happened, right?

829
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:54,004
It's not all that happened, Margo,
he had a son with her. What?

830
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:57,508
Yes, he had a son. I couldn't even
bring myself to tell you before…

831
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:02,913
He's here with us. We brought
him here for Easter vacation.

832
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,985
Their child…
Yes, their child.

833
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,687
…is in your home?
Yes.

834
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:13,258
Oh, come on!

835
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,593
I mean, what are you,
a candidate for sainthood?

836
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,628
Look, I'm not a saint,
I'm scared.

837
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:18,829
You know, I'm afraid
of losing what I have.

838
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:24,769
If I didn't let him bring him here, it
would be a cloud over us forever, you know?

839
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,774
What do the girls think? I don't
know, they think he's cute.

840
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,242
They don't know who he is.

841
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,579
Is he?

842
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:35,813
I don't know.

843
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:36,914
Well, don't you look at him?

844
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:40,718
As little as possible.

845
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:44,522
When I do, all I see is her and
the son I could never give him.

846
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:48,192
I think I'd kill Bob
if I were you.

847
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,396
You know, I would like to kill
him sometimes, I really would.

848
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:57,368
The rest of the time I feel I need him more
than ever. I don't know. I don't know.

849
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:00,037
I think what you need now
is a drink.

850
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,340
I know I need one. Let's get out of here.
I would love a drink.

851
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:04,375
I have to meet
Gavin Wilson. I'm late.

852
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,777
You need some company?

853
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,613
Since when are you
interested in detente?

854
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:11,316
I never stop thinking about it.
Another time.

855
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:16,687
I envy you.
Why?

856
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,492
I wish I could love any man
as much as you love Bob.

857
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:26,597
See ya.

858
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,099
Oh, yeah.

859
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:32,503
Bob, I can't believe this, I mean you
and Sheila, like the perfect couple,

860
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:35,440
like those figures on a wedding cake.
What made you do it?

861
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:37,542
I wanted to talk to you about
what's happening now, Bernie,

862
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,844
not what happened 10 years ago.

863
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:43,147
Well, she must have been something for
you to… I mean, Sheila, my God.

864
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,749
I mean, were you
in love with her?

865
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:47,452
I don't know.

866
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,355
Maybe I was at the time.

867
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,459
Got a picture of her?

868
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:56,994
Oh, for Christ sake, Bernie, look at
the boy, she looked a lot like him.

869
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:02,967
Oh… I, I couldn't do it.
Something like that with Nancy.

870
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,702
God forbid, know what I mean?

871
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,704
She'd get me in court,
I'd get on the stand.

872
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:08,205
She'd talk about my income tax.

873
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,907
That tax shelter in Colorado.

874
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,610
God forbid.

875
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,680
Now, Bo Derek, if Bo Derek liked
me, then I'd maybe consider…

876
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,452
Hey, the knee's better, huh, Bob?
Yeah, a whole lot, Bernie!

877
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,056
Yeah, it's good.
It's good.

878
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,659
I very much like your suggestion of
changing the order of some of the chapters.

879
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:31,562
I think that's excellent.
Oh, good.

880
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:36,166
So, we've agreed that you'll rewrite the
material which you printed as conjecture

881
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,904
when you started the book three years ago,
now that it's an indisputable fact, huh?

882
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:43,408
Yeah, did you make any particular notes
on that? I did, here and here…

883
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,379
You really did do your
homework, didn't you?

884
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:53,884
Uh, and you'll rewrite the new introduction
taking the new facts into account, will you?

885
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:56,086
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I'll do an exchange with you.

886
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,622
Why don't you
have a look at that?

887
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:02,059
Well, you've started
this already!

888
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:05,362
Why did you make me go through my song
and dance? Because I like the music.

889
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,669
Are there any other problems you gonna
throw at me here? I have very little.

890
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,304
Just one general impression.

891
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:17,274
I think in the section on arms limitation,
you're a bit on shaky ground when you use

892
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,276
the word ideology.

893
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,446
You think it's a bit too Marxist
for the university press, do you?

894
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:24,815
Well, I don't know.

895
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,418
I don't mind. It's only a sub heading.
You got any ideas?

896
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,589
Well, I was thinking something
like "The Spirit of Salt One"

897
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,424
or "The Spirit
of Vladivostok."

898
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,025
Perhaps.

899
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,927
Okay. Fine.

900
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:40,698
All right.

901
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:46,604
Would you like a drink?
I have a long drive.

902
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,039
Uh, a soft drink? Really,
I'd better get going.

903
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,879
I am trying to delay your departure.
You do realize that, I hope.

904
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,682
Is that what you're doing?

905
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:01,719
Well in that case, I'll,
um, I'll have a Perrier.

906
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:04,455
Excellent.

907
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:10,160
By the way, I really like that stuff you
did on the Donnelly book, you know.

908
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:13,163
I read the original. I thought
you did some very sophisticated

909
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,732
and intelligent work in it.

910
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,034
Well, thank you, but he
did all the work on that.

911
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,470
Max Perkins said,

912
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:24,909
"An editor can only release energy,
he cannot be creative himself."

913
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,578
Is that what he said?

914
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,618
Here's to.

915
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,989
And when are you gonna start
releasing my energy?

916
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:49,033
Why don't we both do our
reading and meet tomorrow?

917
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,569
I'd like that.

918
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,011
May I buy a postcard for Louis and Simone?
Sure, pick one out.

919
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:04,314
Can I have
a Magic Mountain T-shirt?

920
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,283
Oh, Daddy, let's go to the rollercoaster!
Wait a minute.

921
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,818
Yes, the rollercoaster, please!

922
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:10,621
No, no, wait… Please! Please!
Rollercoaster! Rollercoaster!

923
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,526
That rollercoaster?
Yeah!

924
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,829
No way, you're talking to the wrong man.
What do you think?

925
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,565
Not me. All right. Is
this the one you want?

926
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:21,799
Yes.
Okay, how much is that?

927
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,134
25 cents.
You got a deal.

928
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,136
Hey, guys, come with me. I
got a better idea. Okay.

929
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,151
Here we go!

930
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:45,856
Woah!

931
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,793
Oh!

932
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,837
Let's start with a cap. Everybody in
America has a baseball cap, and so do you.

933
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,440
Uh, what is "La"? No, it's
not "La," that's L.A.

934
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,810
That stands for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, the best team in baseball.

935
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:08,112
Here you go. And this is a baseball.
Hang onto that.

936
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,280
And this is a bat. Two bats.

937
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,617
There's one for you, it's a
Louisville Slugger. Best bat made.

938
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,986
Now, the object of the game is the pitcher
stands on the mound and he throws the ball

939
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,088
to the batter,
and the batter hits the ball.

940
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:20,224
Now, if the ball goes in
the outfield, the batter

941
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:22,627
run, run, runs to first base!
What is a base?

942
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,528
The base. The bag.

943
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,163
Uh, all right.
Tell you what.

944
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:31,035
You like the hat? That's all you need
to know about baseball. Come on.

945
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:42,079
Daddy, you're not
supposed to look!

946
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,514
I'm not looking. Am I looking?
Did anyone see me look?

947
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:45,883
Yeah!
Yeah!

948
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,054
Hello! What are you guys up to?
Mommy!

949
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:54,491
Hello, Mrs. Beckwith!
Hi. Hi. Hello, Jean-Claude.

950
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:58,128
How did it go, huh? Real good,
we missed you. Welcome home.

951
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:01,498
Wash up, everybody! Oh, Mom, we were
just gonna show you and Dad something!

952
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,334
They were rehearsing a dance recital,
they were trying to teach Jean-Claude

953
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:07,371
the stank and the pogo. Oh, yes?
Well, what were they just doing?

954
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:08,873
Was that the stank or the pogo?
You're asking me?

955
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,908
Don't look, Mommy! I never
got beyond the bossa nova.

956
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,577
I won't look. I won't look.

957
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,313
Starving! Kids are getting along
great together, aren't they?

958
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,614
Looks that way, yeah.

959
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,951
Did you happen to see Margo
when you were down there?

960
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:22,920
Oh, yeah, she's great.
Doing well.

961
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:26,824
What kind of a guy
is Gavin Wilson?

962
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,259
Um… Charming.

963
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:34,398
You were always a sucker
for a British accent.

964
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,001
Oh, this stuff must have one
moment when it tastes right.

965
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,969
Well, yeah,
when you're desperate.

966
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,977
When are you going down to
work with him again? Tomorrow.

967
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:52,582
That soon? I have to take
advantage of his being here.

968
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:56,854
He's called away often to, um,
testify in lecture places, you know.

969
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:01,258
How would it be if I came down
to Newport to see you tomorrow?

970
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:06,030
With the children? No, alone.
I can get a sitter.

971
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:12,436
Pick you up after you finish work and
take you out to a gourmet dinner.

972
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:15,005
Maybe catch a show down at
the Old Globe in San Diego.

973
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:18,743
You're catching me at a time
when I'm very vulnerable

974
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,711
to the idea of
a good dinner, you know.

975
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:44,494
Robert.
Hmm?

976
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,265
About Newport tomorrow.
Yes?

977
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:50,968
No.

978
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:19,864
Just when I thought everything was
coming together for all of us,

979
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,531
she left this morning
without a word.

980
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:27,104
Well, Bob, you went to France, you had an
affair that resulted in a child and then

981
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,373
you bring the child home…
What do you expect?

982
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,275
I don't know, it was her
idea to bring him here.

983
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,642
No, I don't think so.

984
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:34,811
I think she was just testing you,
I think she wanted you to say no.

985
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:36,280
No, no, that's not true, Bernie.

986
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,082
She knew I'd go
to France to see him.

987
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:41,385
That's why she made the deal.

988
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:44,354
Ah, come on, if people honored their
deals, I'd be out of business, huh?

989
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,525
I wanna tell you something. You
know the best thing you can do is?

990
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,260
You can send that kid home
as soon as possible.

991
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:51,929
Today wouldn't be bad.
Oh, come on, Bernie.

992
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:53,964
Do you know what
that would do to that boy?

993
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:57,167
Hey, my friend, do you know what
this is gonna do to your marriage?

994
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:02,372
I mean, you're real close
to being a free agent, Bob.

995
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,543
Another thing. What if Sheila wanted to
get even. Have you thought about that?

996
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,844
No, I haven't.

997
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,315
Would you blame her?

998
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,350
I don't know.

999
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:18,956
You know something?
These things get real vicious.

1000
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,726
And I can only
represent one of you.

1001
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:24,061
That's real comforting, Bernie.

1002
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,036
Hey, Frenchie. How come you're
always playing with the girls?

1003
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:33,971
My name is Jean-Claude.

1004
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:37,741
His name is Jean-Claude.
Well, excuse us!

1005
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:41,912
I thought it was Jeanie. Yeah,
with the light brown hair.

1006
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:44,481
He speaks French, and you don't.

1007
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:48,085
You, you… You dope!
Come on, Jean-Claude.

1008
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,990
Hey, Jessica. Why don't you take
Jeanie and get him a dress?

1009
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,327
Hey, all right!
Come on.

1010
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,097
Yay, all right!

1011
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,900
Look at this.
He can really play!

1012
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:06,403
Come on, Jean-Claude!

1013
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:08,105
All right. Come on,
block that ball!

1014
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,615
Wait a minute.
Is that Jean-Claude?

1015
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,522
That can't be Davey.

1016
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:29,994
He's baiting him. I didn't know he
could play soccer. Yeah, I see.

1017
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:34,231
Look at that! Did you see that?
Over the head.

1018
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,200
My God. Yeah. It wasn't
quite over his head.

1019
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:51,248
Davey, you're not trying. It's
just not fair. Did you see that?

1020
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:57,454
He's still at it. Bob, you'd better get
rid of that kid before it's too late,

1021
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,789
you know that? What do
you mean "too late"?

1022
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:01,458
Before you fall
in love with him.

1023
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,727
I already have, Bernie.

1024
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,065
Wasn't he incredible? Huh?

1025
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,735
Magnifique. But of course.
Daddy, I want to get one.

1026
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,804
I think I'll have one myself.
What will it be, gang?

1027
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:17,874
May I have those chips? Yeah, sure, which
one do you want, this one? This one?

1028
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,776
Doritos, here you go.
What do you say, gang?

1029
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,179
Yep. What will you have, Jean-Claude?
I'll have a Coke.

1030
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,181
One Coke. You want any chips?
No, thanks.

1031
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,949
No, nothing else?
Okay, I'll be right with you.

1032
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,884
Let's see, we got four drinks
and two chips.

1033
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,220
Three bucks.
$3, there you go, sir.

1034
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:33,057
You see that kid play soccer? What
a miracle, you really missed something.

1035
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,426
How we doing, gang?

1036
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,462
Oh, boy, how about
that kid, huh?

1037
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:44,734
Jean-Claude, don't you feel good about
what you just did? I feel good.

1038
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,971
Then why don't you smile?

1039
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,339
I can feel good without smiling.

1040
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,541
You can, huh?

1041
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:57,081
I bet I can make you smile.
I don't believe you can.

1042
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:59,083
I'll go you one better, pal.

1043
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:00,317
I'll bet you
I can make you laugh.

1044
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,319
I'll bet you a dollar I can make
you laugh before they count to 10.

1045
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,787
10 francs.

1046
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,290
10 francs? That's worth about a
dollar and a half, isn't it?

1047
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:08,392
All right, Frenchie, you're
on, but you're gonna laugh.

1048
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,593
Right, you guys count.
Okay. One!

1049
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:11,461
No, no, no, not yet.
Wait a minute!

1050
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:13,963
- I got it. Okay, now start counting.
- One!

1051
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:17,267
Jean-Claude, this is my impersonation of
an Olympic swimming champion. Here we go.

1052
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:18,402
Two!

1053
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,074
Hello! And it's grandpa
in the lead, huh?

1054
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,344
Oh, don't like
horse racing, huh?

1055
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,879
Five! Oh, okay, fine. One of the
great jugglers of our time.

1056
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:32,149
Here we go.
Six!

1057
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:34,084
Ah, Dad! Oh, no. I'm gonna lose.
I'm desperate!

1058
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:37,521
Seven! Oh, is he laughing?
Is he laughing?

1059
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:41,558
Put it over his head, Daddy.
Nine!

1060
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:49,399
He's laughing! I did it! I did it!

1061
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:52,969
All right go, Daddy!
All right, Daddy!

1062
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,938
Come on, gang.
Let's clean up this mess.

1063
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,274
Yeah, I know, it's okay.
We bought everything, right?

1064
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,909
There you go. Get all this cleaned up.
There we go.

1065
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:02,546
Hey, you know what? I got a great
idea, listen to this, gang.

1066
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:06,750
What do you say we head home now, and all
of us chip in and make a nice, special,

1067
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,052
gourmet dinner for Mom as a big surprise?
All right!

1068
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,455
Is it a deal? You hold this.
Can I help?

1069
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:14,291
Only if you smile.
All right.

1070
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,160
Good. All right, gang,
finish cleaning up here.

1071
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:28,172
I peeled all the onions.
Good.

1072
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:31,541
When are we gonna
start cooking this?

1073
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:34,077
As soon as I finish
with the ingredients.

1074
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,180
What's this called anyhow?

1075
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,349
Grandma's chicken.

1076
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,387
You're very easy to work with,
Gavi, not at all what I expected.

1077
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:49,926
I'm not sure whether that's a compliment
or not. Formidable, really you are.

1078
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,862
Well, I tell you this, this is definitely
going to be the hardest part of every day,

1079
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:54,798
saying goodnight. To you.

1080
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,134
Can I tempt you to dinner?

1081
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,036
I… I don't think so.

1082
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,338
Look…

1083
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:04,140
You're a very attractive woman.

1084
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,744
Am I?
You are.

1085
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:13,049
You know, I actually needed
that today, Gavin, thank you.

1086
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:16,220
Here you are, then. Sometimes to
break out is good therapy, no?

1087
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,156
Are you making a pass at me?

1088
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,493
I'm not sure.

1089
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,530
Look, I really am…

1090
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:28,365
I'm just not good
at this, you know.

1091
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:31,501
I do not approach women well. I mean,
I don't. Seems I'm too direct.

1092
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:33,537
Maybe that's why I
write non-fiction.

1093
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:40,544
Look, I may be wrong, but it doesn't
seem as if you want to rush home.

1094
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:42,579
One drink, then.

1095
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,549
One brandy.
Just one brandy.

1096
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,688
Brandy.

1097
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,963
Hi.
Hello!

1098
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,933
Wow, I didn't realize editing
was a 12 hour a day job.

1099
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,869
No, it isn't. I finished
a couple of hours ago.

1100
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:44,908
Really? Where have you been?
Hmm, wandering around.

1101
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,877
Put these down. Oh, I love
that picture of you and Frank.

1102
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:50,647
It's Ted.
Is it?

1103
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,751
Oh, was he number two or three?
Oh, will you stop? Come on.

1104
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:59,088
And what were you doing?
Thinking, mostly.

1105
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:02,392
Uh-huh. And when you
weren't thinking?

1106
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:07,697
Well, I had a bacon and tomato sandwich
and a chance to sleep with Gavin Wilson.

1107
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,600
I thought so. I hope they
were both delicious.

1108
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:12,736
I finished the sandwich.
Yeah? What about Gavin?

1109
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,273
I only went as far as
a brandy at his house.

1110
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:21,244
Well, why didn't you stay for a second one?
Oh, come on, I couldn't.

1111
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,648
Weren't you, uh, flattered that a
man like Gavin Wilson wanted you?

1112
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:28,618
I certainly was.

1113
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:31,455
Well, then, what are
you doing here?

1114
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,460
Bob went to bed with
somebody he barely knew.

1115
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:39,529
I found out I couldn't.

1116
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:43,633
Margo, could we have some wine?

1117
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,034
What do you want?
Red or white?

1118
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:47,504
Red. I'll make a quick call
and see how the kids are.

1119
01:11:58,281 --> 01:11:59,516
Excuse me.

1120
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,257
Hello.
Robert, it's Sheila.

1121
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:10,960
Sheila!
Where the hell are you?

1122
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:14,964
I'm down at Margo's.
How are the kids doing?

1123
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,867
They're fine, love. They made
a very special meal for you,

1124
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:19,669
and we're all
sitting here waiting.

1125
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,104
Is there any chance
you can come home?

1126
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:24,808
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I don't think I can.

1127
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,677
You know, I'm down here
working very hard.

1128
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:32,382
I've been, uh,
preoccupied with things.

1129
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,488
Look, Robert, I know,
but I've been busy.

1130
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:42,992
I'm sorry I didn't call,
you know. I'm not perfect.

1131
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:03,713
Huh. I just did something I never
did before. I hung up on Robert.

1132
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:11,455
Your role as the perfect wife is
hardly rewarding, is it? Perfect?

1133
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,892
I certainly wasn't
prepared for all the surprises.

1134
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,963
It's a long way from
Vassar, isn't it?

1135
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:22,999
Hmm.

1136
01:13:27,471 --> 01:13:29,473
I want you guys
to clear the table.

1137
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,000
Your favorite.

1138
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,037
What is this, one of those new light
wines with very little alcohol?

1139
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:03,039
No!

1140
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:05,642
It's a regular bottle
of cheap Italian.

1141
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,511
The kind that used to make us
feel so good in college.

1142
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,046
Mmm-hmm. Has our metabolism
changed that much?

1143
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,749
Well, I think we just felt pretty
good to begin with in those days.

1144
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,184
A gentleman caller?

1145
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:16,786
Hmm, I hope so.

1146
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:23,459
It's Bob, what do you
want me to do?

1147
01:14:23,493 --> 01:14:24,894
Ah, let him in.

1148
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:33,036
Hi, Bob. Margo. Sorry
to barge in so late.

1149
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,471
Oh, it's no problem. What
are you doing here, Robert?

1150
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:36,673
Who's with the children?
Don't worry about the kids.

1151
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:37,941
Since when do you hang up on me?

1152
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,509
Don't start this
in front of Margo.

1153
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:41,678
It's already started.
I asked you a question!

1154
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:44,080
Since when do you
hang up on me, Sheila?

1155
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:45,915
Why don't I make us
all some coffee?

1156
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:48,051
Good idea, Margo.
Why did you hang up on me?

1157
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,385
I didn't have anything else
to say to you.

1158
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,054
I got some things to say to you.
What do you have to say?

1159
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:53,156
What the hell are you really
doing down here? I'm working!

1160
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:55,659
What's the urgency?
I told you, Gavin is a…

1161
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,094
Ah, to hell with him. He's not
Henry Kissinger, for Christ sake,

1162
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:00,229
and you're not working
for Simon and Schuster!

1163
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,766
He is a serious writer.
I'm a serious editor.

1164
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:04,534
What are you serious
about, Robert?

1165
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:05,869
I'm serious about
our marriage, God damn it!

1166
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:07,571
That's why I came down here.

1167
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,706
The hell you are. You know what
you're serious about? Your son.

1168
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,507
All right, what if I am?
What is so wrong about that?

1169
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,209
Your son.
To hell with our marriage!

1170
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,879
The only thing you've been concerned
about since that boy came to the house

1171
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:18,514
is that somebody would
find out he was my son.

1172
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:22,151
Yeah, well that is right. That is right.
I admit it. I can't deal with it.

1173
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,287
Obviously, you can't deal… So
what does that make me? I'm sorry.

1174
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,623
I… I'm angry.

1175
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:28,725
I have every right
to be angry. You lied to me.

1176
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:31,094
You never did that to me before.
I'm jealous.

1177
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,329
I'm jealous when I see you
look at him the way you do,

1178
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,865
with pride in your eyes. You don't
look at the girls that way.

1179
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,601
You don't look at me that way.
You don't care.

1180
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:39,068
Oh, Jesus!
Where have you been?

1181
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:40,770
You have never
said to me just once,

1182
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:43,139
"Sheila, can you
handle this?"

1183
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:46,109
You just never reached out
to me emotionally at all.

1184
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:48,211
All right. But it was your idea to
bring him here in the first place.

1185
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:51,547
All right. That was intellectual.
I did it in my head.

1186
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,883
But my heart is here. And I
can't make the connection.

1187
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:03,627
All right. It's true!

1188
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,863
I had an image of you and an image of our
marriage. And both are shot to hell.

1189
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,798
So where do we go from here?

1190
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,138
In a funny way, maybe it's the best
thing that could have happened to us.

1191
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:18,608
You know. I mean, everybody has always
treated us as a perfect, perfect couple.

1192
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,844
And we find out, don't we?

1193
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:22,646
We're just like
everybody else, aren't we?

1194
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:24,681
We can start from scratch,
if there is any love left.

1195
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:28,484
Well, I'm not everybody else's husband
and you're not everybody else's wife.

1196
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,655
And whatever is wrong between us shouldn't
affect the child. He's an innocent bystander.

1197
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:34,257
He is my son, and he's going
be my son all my life.

1198
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,726
And I am going to be his father.

1199
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,794
You want him to stay here
forever, don't you?

1200
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:39,963
Confess it, Robert.

1201
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:43,466
You know that's what you've been
driving at since he's been here.

1202
01:16:43,499 --> 01:16:45,802
It's true. I can't deny it.
That's what I want.

1203
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,006
Yeah, I don't know if I can handle it.
You know. I can't.

1204
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:52,375
Love, there are problems
between us, but look,

1205
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:55,111
he is only going to be here for,
what, almost a week. Can't you…

1206
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:58,748
Give a little bit.
Can't you…

1207
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:00,383
I mean…

1208
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,221
Listen, I need you, Robert. I need you.
I still love you, and…

1209
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,826
I'm lost without you.
Oh, God, I love you, darling.

1210
01:17:24,774 --> 01:17:27,076
Can I talk to you for
a minute, Jessie? Hi.

1211
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:31,014
So talk. Not here, outside.
In private.

1212
01:17:32,716 --> 01:17:34,250
Come on, Jessie, it's important.

1213
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,887
Such an adolescent.

1214
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,942
I heard my parents talking
last night…

1215
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:23,699
This is the finest
medical school in California.

1216
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:28,471
What would you think about going
to school here in America?

1217
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:31,140
I'd have to think about it.

1218
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,443
My mother wanted me
to go to school in France.

1219
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,716
I'm sure she wouldn't have minded if she
knew you were going to be with friends.

1220
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,787
Does that mean I would go to school
with Jessica and Paula? Sure.

1221
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,121
I would like that.

1222
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:48,257
You'll just have to
give that some thought.

1223
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:53,362
You know, I thought Mr. Wilson
was going to be conceited,

1224
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:55,431
but he wasn't.
Here, let me that for you.

1225
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:59,368
We missed you. Good. I missed you.
Where is everybody anyway?

1226
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,304
Mom. Mom! Yes, sweetheart,
we're in here.

1227
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,739
What? What's the matter?

1228
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,209
Is it true?
Is what true?

1229
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,378
Is it true about Daddy
and Jean-Claude?

1230
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,014
Did something happen?
What are you talking about?

1231
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:12,782
Who told you?
It is.

1232
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:15,251
I can see it in your face.

1233
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:17,921
What's going on? David just
told me that Jean-Claude

1234
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:19,823
is Daddy's son.

1235
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,160
Let me explain it to you.
No! First admit it.

1236
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:26,195
Tell her that Dad
is really his father.

1237
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:31,034
Yes, it's true.
He's our Dad! He's ours.

1238
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,837
Don't you understand,
you little idiot?

1239
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,271
He had an affair with
Jean-Claude's mother.

1240
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:36,873
What's an affair?

1241
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,542
He went to bed with her
and made a baby.

1242
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:44,047
Is Daddy going to leave us?

1243
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:45,982
No, he's not going to leave us.

1244
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:48,584
Look, will you let me
explain it, please?

1245
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,054
You ruined our whole family.

1246
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:53,923
It's going to be all right.
Let me explain.

1247
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:56,860
Hey. Hello, everybody.
Guess what?

1248
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,828
I took Jean-Claude on
a tour of the university,

1249
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:00,864
and he's decided to enter medical
school tomorrow. Isn't that right?

1250
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:04,567
What…

1251
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:08,004
You. You little bastard!

1252
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:09,939
Jessica!

1253
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:14,210
He's our Daddy,
not yours. He's ours!

1254
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:15,945
Paula.

1255
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,548
What the hell is going on here?

1256
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:21,817
Ask your friend Bernie. Why didn't
you put an ad in The Times?

1257
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:23,819
Girls.

1258
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:27,991
Jean-Claude, wait a minute.
Jean-Claude!

1259
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:32,095
Jean-Claude!

1260
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,169
Hey, Jean-Claude, wait up.

1261
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,271
Hey!

1262
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,175
Hey, you forgot something.
I forgot nothing.

1263
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,512
Jean-Claude, listen to me. I'm
sorry about what Jessica did you.

1264
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:50,346
Listen to me, will you?

1265
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:54,717
Look, she's upset
with me, not you.

1266
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,420
Jessica would never do anything to
harm you. You know that, don't you?

1267
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,688
I want to go home tomorrow.
I don't want you to go home.

1268
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:01,624
I should never have come here.

1269
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:04,593
My mother wanted me to go to school at
La Roche, and that is where I'm going.

1270
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:05,995
Is that what you really
want to do?

1271
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:09,065
I belong in France, not here. You
belong here with me. I'm your father.

1272
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,008
I… I don't believe you.

1273
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:24,013
Well, it's true, God damn it.
It's true.

1274
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,626
Louis knows all about it.

1275
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,532
I didn't even know you existed
until a few days ago.

1276
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:47,370
Your mother never
wanted me to know.

1277
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:50,906
I'm sorry. I…

1278
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:55,979
I should have told you
when you first got here.

1279
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,347
But I was afraid.

1280
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:03,352
I was trying to protect Sheila
and the girls and myself.

1281
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:07,490
I'm really sorry, Jean-Claude.

1282
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:14,697
I hope you can forgive me for causing
you so much misery and unhappiness.

1283
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,033
But I'm happy, Bob.

1284
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,536
What?

1285
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:23,272
I'm happy you're my father.

1286
01:22:26,309 --> 01:22:27,143
Really?

1287
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:30,546
My mother used to
talk about my father.

1288
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:33,116
What did she tell you?

1289
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:34,617
She said

1290
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:36,952
that he was good,

1291
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:40,089
and kind and funny.

1292
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,660
And even when I first saw you,

1293
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:48,431
I hoped that maybe

1294
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,700
my father could be
someone like you.

1295
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,389
Come on. Take me home,
will you?

1296
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,662
My home is in France.

1297
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:21,530
And that's where I feel
I must live now.

1298
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,067
I understand.

1299
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:36,445
Jean-Claude.

1300
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:43,352
You okay?

1301
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:46,655
I'm fine, Bob.

1302
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:49,325
You want some dinner?

1303
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:51,227
No, thank you.

1304
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:55,598
I'm going to go upstairs now
and pack.

1305
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:56,532
Okay.

1306
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:13,182
A demain, Jean-Claude.

1307
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:17,186
A demain, Bob.

1308
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:35,538
Did you tell him?

1309
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:39,642
I didn't have any choice.

1310
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:43,512
How is he?

1311
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,552
He went upstairs to pack.
He wants to go home tomorrow.

1312
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:54,757
Where are the girls?

1313
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:57,326
In their room.

1314
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:00,629
Bob.

1315
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,778
All right, let's have this out.

1316
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:22,351
I want to discuss
things with you.

1317
01:25:22,385 --> 01:25:23,819
There's nothing to discuss.

1318
01:25:25,388 --> 01:25:27,323
Look, I know how you feel.
No, you don't.

1319
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:34,062
Look, this has been a real big shock for
both of you. And I want to apologize.

1320
01:25:34,096 --> 01:25:36,199
I don't want your apology.
Me neither.

1321
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:41,404
I'm apologizing for lying
about Jean-Claude.

1322
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:43,239
And what about your
affair with his mother?

1323
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,642
I don't have to apologize
about that to you, young lady.

1324
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:47,610
That's between
your mother and me.

1325
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:50,246
Don't you love us anymore?

1326
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:53,516
Of course I love you, darling.
I love you very much.

1327
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:55,418
Why did you bring him here?

1328
01:25:58,221 --> 01:25:59,154
Because I had to see him.

1329
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:01,290
Why?

1330
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:05,494
Because he's my son, Paula.

1331
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:13,502
Look, I did something
about 10 years ago.

1332
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:17,273
Something I shouldn't have done.

1333
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:19,608
I am not very proud of it.
But I am very proud of him.

1334
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:24,480
And up until a few minutes ago, before
you guys found out he was my son,

1335
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,482
you thought he was hot stuff,
didn't you?

1336
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,584
Come on, admit it. You did.

1337
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:32,020
In your own words, Jessica,
you said he was magnifique.

1338
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:33,322
And he is magnifique.

1339
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:38,427
As long as we're being honest about it,
let's be honest about something else.

1340
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:40,162
You guys have had it
pretty good growing up.

1341
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,797
You've have both parents, your
own home and a lot of love.

1342
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:44,767
And all he's had is a mother.
Now she's gone.

1343
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:49,372
Put yourself in my shoes.
What would you do?

1344
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:51,807
What would you do if you heard about
somebody out there all by themselves,

1345
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,842
somebody who wasn't
even related to you?

1346
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,278
Wouldn't you go out to them?

1347
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:56,945
Sure you would.
I know you would.

1348
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,554
Jean-Claude's
going home tomorrow.

1349
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:10,959
I don't know if we'll
ever see him again.

1350
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:13,228
And whether or not you guys decide
to talk to him is up to you,

1351
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:14,663
but I think you owe him
an apology.

1352
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:16,432
Both of you.

1353
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:27,410
You think about it.

1354
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:32,348
I love you both very, very much.

1355
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,351
And I know that you love me.

1356
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:06,048
I hope that's the way
you like it.

1357
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:08,484
Thank you.

1358
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:20,596
I'm sorry this has been
such a hard time for you.

1359
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,767
No. It is I who should
apologize.

1360
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,371
I think I have brought you
much sadness.

1361
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:31,740
It was not my wish.

1362
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,044
It's not your fault.
You must never think that.

1363
01:28:38,914 --> 01:28:41,016
When I came here,
I did not know.

1364
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:43,652
I know.

1365
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:44,987
We should have told you.

1366
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,055
That Bob is my father?

1367
01:28:49,392 --> 01:28:51,059
Yes, Jean-Claude.
Bob is your father.

1368
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:53,929
That is why you are
angry with him?

1369
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:56,565
Yes.

1370
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:02,037
So you must also have been
angry with me.

1371
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,943
I suppose so, at first.

1372
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:11,079
But then you came.

1373
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:13,649
We got to know each other.

1374
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:18,020
And I hope now
we can be friends.

1375
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:22,525
Can we be friends, Jean-Claude?

1376
01:29:27,963 --> 01:29:30,599
Thank you very much
for the coffee, madame.

1377
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:32,801
It was very good.

1378
01:29:42,645 --> 01:29:44,480
We have to go now, Jean-Claude.

1379
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:58,994
Please say goodbye
to Jessica and Paula for me.

1380
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:02,998
Goodbye, madame.

1381
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,735
Many thanks for everything.

1382
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:09,071
Goodbye, Jean-Claude.

1383
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:04,560
What's going to happen now, Mommy?
I don't know, sweetie.

1384
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,934
How can you even talk to Daddy
after what he's done? Jessica.

1385
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,039
Do you know the most painful
part of growing up? No.

1386
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,942
Discovering nobody is perfect.

1387
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:22,244
Not even your parents.

1388
01:31:57,479 --> 01:32:00,883
I called Louis last night. He's going
to pick you up at the airport in Paris.

1389
01:32:02,284 --> 01:32:03,151
All right.

1390
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:25,674
Bob, I bet you 10 francs that I can
make you laugh before you count to 10.

1391
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:28,811
I bet you a dollar you can't.

1392
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:35,183
No, no!
It's okay.

1393
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:09,818
Can I see your ticket please?

1394
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:15,958
This is an excursion fare. You
have to stay at least 10 days.

1395
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:17,392
I know. I'm going to pay
the difference.

1396
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:18,827
That's $225.

1397
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:34,643
TWA announces the departure
of Flight 890, non-stop service to Paris,

1398
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:38,981
now boarding at Gate 35. Passengers
please have your boarding passes ready.

1399
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:54,029
You sure you've got enough in
here to read for the flight?

1400
01:33:54,062 --> 01:33:55,363
Yes.

1401
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:08,911
Will those passengers
holding green boarding passes,

1402
01:34:08,944 --> 01:34:12,047
rows 49 through 65,
kindly board now?

1403
01:34:15,918 --> 01:34:17,753
Well, your seat number
is 24, but…

1404
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,823
You can board last. We…

1405
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:23,291
We have a few minutes.
Let's sit down over here.

1406
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:38,206
Will those passengers
holding green boarding passes,

1407
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,876
rows 48 through 30,
please board now?

1408
01:34:49,051 --> 01:34:50,919
So…

1409
01:34:50,953 --> 01:34:53,021
Maybe you'll visit us
again at Christmas time.

1410
01:34:54,122 --> 01:34:57,192
Or even this summer.
I mean, any time you want.

1411
01:34:58,193 --> 01:34:59,027
Thank you.

1412
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:03,398
So, you'll come again
this summer?

1413
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:07,035
Oh, thank God.
We thought we'd missed you.

1414
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:10,038
Jessica and Paula wanted to
say goodbye, Jean-Claude.

1415
01:35:10,906 --> 01:35:12,775
I'm really sorry
about what I did.

1416
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:15,143
So am I.

1417
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:18,080
We want you to come
back and see us, Jean-Claude.

1418
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:20,448
Yes, I would like that.

1419
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:23,051
Bye, Jean-Claude.

1420
01:35:23,085 --> 01:35:25,187
Goodbye. Excuse me,
are you going on this flight?

1421
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,990
Um, no. He is. Well, I will
take his ticket, then.

1422
01:35:28,023 --> 01:35:29,758
And you have to board
right away, okay?

1423
01:35:32,761 --> 01:35:33,762
Goodbye, Mrs. Beckwith.

1424
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:39,301
Goodbye, Jean-Claude.

1425
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,941
I'm sorry, sir. He has
to board right now.

1426
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:23,979
Sir, he has to board the flight
now, or he will not make it.

1427
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:45,267
Go on.

1428
01:36:50,338 --> 01:36:51,206
Au revoir, Papa.

1429
01:36:52,707 --> 01:36:53,475
Au revoir, mon fils.

1430
01:36:55,911 --> 01:36:56,912
Je t'aime.

1431
01:36:58,313 --> 01:36:59,247
I love you, too.
