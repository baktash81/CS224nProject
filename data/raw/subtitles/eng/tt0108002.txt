1
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:18,766
All right, guys, line up.

2
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:23,940
Rudy, take that stupid helmet off.
You're not even playing.

3
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:29,080
Me and Pete, we're Notre Dame.
You guys, you're Michigan.

4
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:32,082
Okay, huddle up. Come on.

5
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:36,790
- Same play. I'll hand it off to you.
- Okay. I got it.

6
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:38,957
One, two, three, break!

7
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:41,829
Come on, Rudy.
Get on the ball.

8
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:44,198
Ready! 42, blow!

9
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,266
Set, hut!

10
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,341
I told you to cut inside.

11
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,110
Do it right.

12
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,810
Come on, Todd.

13
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,211
Try it again. Let's go.

14
00:01:57,246 --> 00:01:59,583
All right, Todd. Same thing, okay?

15
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:00,849
Break.

16
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:03,020
- Ready?
- Let's go. Get on the ball.

17
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,121
I'm sick of being all-time center.

18
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:07,659
- What?
- I'm sick of being all-time center.

19
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,026
I told you five times.

20
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,664
You can't play anything
else but that.

21
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,297
You're too small.

22
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:16,036
- I can too.
- You guys, I'm going. I'm sorry.

23
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,502
- I gotta go.
- We need you.

24
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,974
- Come on.
- Let Rudy play in my place.

25
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,876
Good idea, Frank. Let Rudy play.

26
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,176
Come on. Why not?

27
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:27,416
Okay, you can rush the passer.

28
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,602
All right, Rudy.

29
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:31,680
We gotta get them.

30
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,286
- Break.
- Okay.

31
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,858
Okay, let's go.

32
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,561
Ready!

33
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,194
Set, hut!

34
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:43,534
Get him, Rudy. Get him.

35
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,106
- The snow, for the touchdown.
- Yeah!

36
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,592
All right!

37
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,010
What a spaz.

38
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:55,081
All right! We won, guys!

39
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,961
- There you go.
- Thanks.

40
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,312
Pete, you got your own home?

41
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:53,418
- Last time I looked.
- You're welcome here anytime.

42
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:55,753
Excuse me, young lady. Who are you?

43
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:56,887
Sherry Walinski.

44
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:58,657
- Bob's kid?
- Rudy's girlfriend.

45
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,560
She is not.

46
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,395
Yes, I am.

47
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,131
- Everybody has a job at the mill.
- But I don't want that.

48
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:11,239
Where else you gonna get 5 bucks
an hour? You got union protection.

49
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,276
You got relatives watching
your front and your back.

50
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,277
Tell me where you'll find this...

51
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:19,616
- ... and God be with you.
- But, Dad, Pat's going there-

52
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:22,920
- You gonna give me indigestion here?
- Leave the boy alone.

53
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,623
But this boy can go off on his own.
You heard him.

54
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:29,259
That's enough.

55
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:34,500
Has anybody else got anything to say
before I start this meaI?

56
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,605
After high schooI, I'm gonna
play football at Notre Dame.

57
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,808
Play football at Notre Dame?

58
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:44,579
And I'll buy a mansion
on Lake Shore Drive.

59
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,891
Rudy...

60
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,762
What are we watching? ChanneI 7.

61
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:04,607
- Don't you want something to drink?
- That's okay. Thanks.

62
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,476
- Mr. Ruettiger?
- Yeah, Pete.

63
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:16,316
At halftime, could we watch
some of the Indiana-Purdue game?

64
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:19,520
There's only one team we watch
in this house, right?

65
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:21,930
Right.

66
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:33,403
And I want the ends in there fast,
every play, every play.

67
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:34,936
We're under controI.

68
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:38,308
Any men in the backfield,
analyze before you move.

69
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:41,646
If they throw a forward pass,
see the ball in the air...

70
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,081
...and then go and get it.
When we get it...

71
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:47,469
...that's when we go on offense.
That's when we go to them.

72
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:50,824
We're going inside and outside them,
inside and outside them.

73
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:53,425
We'll get them and
keep them on the run.

74
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,696
We won't pass unless our
secondary comes up too close.

75
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,369
But don't forget, we'll get them
on the run and go, go, go, go!

76
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,736
Don't stop untiI we're
over the goaI line.

77
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,673
Don't forget men, today's
the day we're gonna win.

78
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:09,912
They can't beat us in the fight and
we'll fight, fight, fight, fight!

79
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:12,557
What do you say, men? Yeah!

80
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,060
Ruettiger! Hey, Rudy!

81
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,995
Kill that halfback.
Move that secondary back.

82
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,072
- We gotta get ready for those-
- Come on, offense. Break!

83
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:34,877
Black, 80!

84
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,682
Set, hut!

85
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:45,054
- Bring it on down. Come on!
- All right, let's go.

86
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,923
Come on, Pete. Come on, buddy.

87
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,662
I didn't hurt you, did I?

88
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,065
Take a knee, guys.

89
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,400
Listen up.

90
00:06:56,435 --> 00:07:00,640
You seniors, this is
your last practice.

91
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:04,845
And with the exception of
Thomas, Lee, Bo...

92
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,479
...Sypitch, you get on the weights...

93
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:12,520
...tomorrow night will be the last
time you put on a football uniform.

94
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:16,659
You know these last four years
have gone by too fast.

95
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:19,560
They always do.

96
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,630
And I gotta tell you guys...

97
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:25,635
...that I really appreciate
the hard work and effort...

98
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,973
...that you've given to me,
to the coaches...

99
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,643
...and to the Hilltoppers.

100
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,043
As a reward...

101
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,146
...I'll give each
one of you seniors...

102
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:40,887
...one finaI hit on me and
my friend down there.

103
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,389
All right. Seniors, stay here.

104
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:46,971
Underclassmen, two lines,
five yards apart. Let's go!

105
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,008
You're first, McConnell!

106
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:03,319
Give me your best shot!
Remember, it's gonna be your last!

107
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,073
Good shot!

108
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,067
Shower room.

109
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,036
Constantino!

110
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:16,970
Come on, David!

111
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,822
Ruettiger!

112
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:43,527
Okay, Rudy. Okay.

113
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:46,669
Hey, Rudy, we're gonna miss you.

114
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,848
Come on, Pete!

115
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,995
I can't believe it's over.

116
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:15,817
The bicameral legislature
originated...

117
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:18,738
...not in the United States,
but where?

118
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,476
Rudy, Rudy.

119
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,982
Mr. Ruettiger, would you be
interested in joining us?

120
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:32,818
- The House and the Senate-
- Don't even try.

121
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:37,859
If I were giving out grades for
daydreaming, you'd be getting an A.

122
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:40,245
But in civics, you're failing.

123
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,563
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

124
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,936
...the problem with dreamers
is, they usually aren't doers.

125
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:49,705
Their achievements are
grand up here...

126
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,977
...but here where it counts,
they fall short.

127
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:59,218
Now, the bicameraI legislature
originated- Hold up.

128
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:02,387
I have an announcement.

129
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:07,227
"If you are a student interested in
the University of Notre Dame...

130
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:12,033
...a bus will be leaving here
at 10 a. m. Saturday, December 15th...

131
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,598
...for a one-day guided
tour of the campus.

132
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:19,128
Please sign up by Wednesday,
November 5th. "

133
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:44,104
And Raciniak, good.

134
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,072
Whoa, wait!

135
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:47,774
Where are you going?

136
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,578
I'm going to see Notre Dame.

137
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:57,052
Do you have some friends
in South Bend?

138
00:10:57,087 --> 00:11:00,455
- No.
- Then there must be some other reason.

139
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,061
When you announced it in class,
I thought anybody could go.

140
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:09,735
I'm sorry. This bus is for students
who want to attend the university.

141
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,072
It's not a sightseeing tour.

142
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:19,445
Maybe someday I'll go to schooI there.

143
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,014
- Father Joseph, take over for me.
- Of course.

144
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:25,985
Rudy...

145
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,357
...you don't have the grades for Joliet
Community, much less Notre Dame.

146
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:33,528
The secret to happiness
in this life...

147
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:34,931
...is to be gratefuI for the gifts
the good Lord has bestowed upon us.

148
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:39,241
Rudy...

149
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,121
...not everyone is meant
to go to college.

150
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:18,515
Dad, wait up!

151
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,617
What about this order?

152
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:23,689
We have to change
the rollers on number 13.

153
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,289
- Thirteen?
- Yeah.

154
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:28,762
All right, we'll have the crane
ready for you, okay?

155
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,330
Hey, Rudy.

156
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:34,801
Rudy!

157
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:37,538
You were late again today?

158
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,392
You were late?

159
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,175
Get serious.

160
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,623
No speciaI days here.

161
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:54,692
What is today?

162
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:58,530
- Friday.
- No, no, I mean the date.

163
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:00,701
August 23rd.

164
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,770
And that is...?

165
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,769
My birthday.

166
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:08,073
Twenty-two big ones!

167
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:11,611
Pete, it's starting to go by too fast.

168
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:14,405
Well, I didn't
have time to wrap it, but...

169
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,166
- Go ahead, open it.
- You shouldn't have.

170
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:32,373
This is fantastic.

171
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,273
Where did you find this?

172
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:40,413
I saw it in this surplus store and
I said, "That's gotta be yours. "

173
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:43,215
This is unbelievable.

174
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,060
Pete, I don't know how
I'm ever gonna thank you.

175
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:55,663
How's it look?

176
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:58,106
You were born to wear the jacket.

177
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,574
Do you know Ara...

178
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:09,247
...is the only coach in Notre Dame
history who encourages walk-on players?

179
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:13,218
You probably know more about
the team than half the players.

180
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,288
I can't wait to get there.

181
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,959
Guess how much money I have saved up?

182
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,294
Twenty?

183
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:23,532
Eighty? Fifty?

184
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,736
1000 dollars.

185
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:31,245
That's a good start!

186
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:40,518
You're the only one who ever
took me serious, Pete.

187
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:43,186
Well, you know what
my dad always said.

188
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:48,035
"Having dreams is what
makes life tolerable. "

189
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,771
-2-2-0-5.
-2-2-0-9.

190
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:01,442
That's 2-2-0-9.
That's the house, Rudy!

191
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:03,142
Isn't it cute?

192
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,678
We can afford this.

193
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:07,483
And know what else it has?
Wall-to-wall carpeting.

194
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:11,005
It has a fireplace.

195
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,457
And a big kitchen.

196
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:18,095
It's close to the schools.

197
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,931
What's wrong?

198
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,869
Nothing.

199
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:27,278
It's great, Sherry. It's great.
You did a great job.

200
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,812
Look, buddy...

201
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:37,117
...I've put in my time.

202
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:39,921
I've been very patient
waiting for us to save up...

203
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:43,759
...so we could get married
and do this right.

204
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,229
You owe me.

205
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:48,630
Come on.

206
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,402
I think you're gonna like it.

207
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:59,245
- Can I get another beer down here?
- Sure. Coming right up.

208
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,247
What are you doing tomorrow night?

209
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:03,215
A little TV.

210
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,987
Coach Parseghian is speaking at the
Chicago Grid Iron Club. Wanna go?

211
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:09,422
Sure. If Rhonda
lets me stay out late.

212
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:12,526
Tell her the D train gets
back no later than 10:30-

213
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:15,597
Ara Parseghian? You just
can't give it up, can you?

214
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:18,565
He's the greatest coach
in the country, Frank.

215
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,403
Are you gonna kiss his autographed
picture every night?

216
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:25,309
- What is your problem?
- Or maybe he'll let you wipe his ass.

217
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:29,144
- Why don't you leave him alone?
- Mind your own business.

218
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:33,751
As long as my brother talks this crazy
Notre Dame shit, he deserves this.

219
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,223
Hey, you were a pretty big
Notre Dame fan.

220
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:41,228
I used to collect baseball cards too.

221
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,995
Forget about it.

222
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,702
You know what Coach Gillespie
said about you, Frank?

223
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:49,969
He said you had a lot of talent.

224
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:53,308
But your problem was,
you were too afraid of getting hit.

225
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:55,461
You had no guts.

226
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,545
Go to hell, Pete.

227
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,749
- Come on.
- It's okay.

228
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:05,623
He used to tell me if you had one
half of Rudy's heart and desire...

229
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:09,060
...you could have been
all-conference.

230
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,067
He said you were a pussy.

231
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,007
Frank!

232
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,778
Come on, Frank.

233
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,778
Rudy!

234
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,649
- Rudy! Rudy!
- All right!

235
00:17:27,684 --> 00:17:29,219
That's enough!

236
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:31,056
Do you hear me?!

237
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,858
That's enough!

238
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,898
Frank, good!

239
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:44,722
Don't nothing ever change?

240
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:47,946
Throw them out, Mary Ann.

241
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:58,319
You didn't have to get into it
with Frank. I can take care of myself.

242
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:01,955
I know you can.
That was between him and me!

243
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,360
Ever since he started working here,
he's been pissed off.

244
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:08,231
Because he's not the same
kind of god around here...

245
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,773
...that he was in high schooI.

246
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:19,691
We got a breakout!

247
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,662
Rudy, I need more water!

248
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,933
I'm not getting any!

249
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:39,171
Try another valve!

250
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,709
I'm not getting any, Pete!

251
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,076
Come on, goddamn it.

252
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:50,216
There's no pressure in the line.
We need to get out of here!

253
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,622
Turn something!

254
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:00,277
Pete!

255
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,117
Let us pray.

256
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:27,322
O, God, who alone are ever
mercifuI and sparing of punishment...

257
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:32,063
...humbly we pray You in behalf of
the souI of Your servant, Peter...

258
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:35,799
...whom You have commanded to
go forth today from this world.

259
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:40,523
Do not hand him over to the enemy,
and do not forget him forever...

260
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,504
...but command that this souI
be taken up by the holy angels...

261
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,414
...and brought home to Paradise.
So that, since he hoped...

262
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:52,153
...and believed in You, he may not
undergo the punishments of Hell...

263
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:55,458
- I'm so sorry. He was a friend.
- Thank you.

264
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,253
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

265
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,559
You okay?

266
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,633
You wanna just go home?

267
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,070
I'm going to South Bend.

268
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,471
Now is not the time.

269
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:42,852
If I don't go now, I'll never be any
good for you or for me or anybody.

270
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,491
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:56,561
Well...

272
00:20:56,596 --> 00:21:02,537
...if you have to go, then
you'll have to go alone.

273
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:06,006
I know.

274
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,439
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,579
Dad.

276
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,592
What are you doing here?

277
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:54,047
You can take a couple of weeks off.

278
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:14,187
Your grandfather saved
all of his life...

279
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:18,291
...to bring the family
to this country.

280
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:22,365
He got a good job in the stockyards.
He had a nice little house...

281
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,972
...South Chicago.

282
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:33,510
I was about 12.

283
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:38,150
Somebody sold him on the idea
he ought to move to the country...

284
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:40,625
...and become a dairy farmer.

285
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:47,994
Well...

286
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:52,671
...he buys some land, you know,
and gets a couple hundred cows.

287
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:57,312
Within five months, every one of
those cows was dead with disease.

288
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:07,101
It was the Depression.

289
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,889
Couldn't sell the land.

290
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:15,528
There was no work.

291
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:18,933
So one day...

292
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:22,804
...he took off.

293
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,606
Didn't come back.

294
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:29,030
My brothers and me, we split up...

295
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,420
...to live with friends and relatives.

296
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:41,791
Chasing a stupid dream...

297
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:49,534
...causes nothing but you and
everyone around you heartache.

298
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,705
Notre Dame is for rich kids...

299
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,206
...smart kids...

300
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:59,947
...great athletes. It's not for us.

301
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,148
You're a Ruettiger.

302
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:07,322
There's nothing wrong with that.
You can have a damn nice life.

303
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:10,524
Frank is gonna take over
plant number two.

304
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,463
A couple years, he'll make
more than me and Johnny.

305
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,732
He's in charge of
the expansion program.

306
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:19,672
I don't wanna be Frank or John.

307
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:58,383
Excuse me, I need to see somebody
about going to schooI here.

308
00:24:58,418 --> 00:24:59,783
Now?

309
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:04,323
Admissions office doesn't open
for another couple of hours yet.

310
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:07,661
There's gotta be somebody
I can talk to now.

311
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:09,094
Please?

312
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:15,336
Well, you could talk to a priest.
Maybe that's what you need, son.

313
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:18,207
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

314
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:20,011
Just a minute.

315
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:30,357
Mr. Ruettiger?

316
00:26:30,392 --> 00:26:33,065
- Rudy.
- I'm Father Cavanaugh.

317
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:40,971
How long have you thought
about this decision?

318
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:42,871
For as long as I can remember-

319
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:47,261
Have you taken the proper steps,
investigated the process?

320
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:51,617
- Yes. I have more to learn, but-
- Are you fully aware...

321
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,755
...of the sacrifices
you'll have to make?

322
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,489
I am.

323
00:26:57,524 --> 00:27:01,529
I'll do whatever it takes.

324
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:05,499
What brought you here today?

325
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:09,037
I just came from my best friend's
funeraI. He said that-

326
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:10,605
Of course.

327
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,107
What do you mean, "Of course"?

328
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:15,343
Well, it's very common for people...

329
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:18,482
...suffering a crisis to seek
escape into the cloth.

330
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:21,586
- We recommend a grieving-
- Escape into the cloth?

331
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:24,020
That's just an expression
that we use...

332
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:28,361
...for those who are running away from
emotionaI or psychologicaI pain...

333
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:32,731
...by choosing priesthood.

334
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:37,271
You think I want to become a priest?

335
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,272
Don't you?

336
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:44,113
Nothing against being a priest,
but I don't think it's for me.

337
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:46,247
Why are you here?

338
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:53,089
I want to go to schooI at Notre Dame.

339
00:27:53,124 --> 00:27:54,824
Well, have you applied?

340
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:58,729
No, my grades have never been
very good, even though I tried.

341
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:02,601
But I'll try harder. I'll study
20 hours a day if I have to.

342
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:07,205
This university,
it's not for everybody.

343
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,676
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to go to schooI here.

344
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:16,950
And ever since I was a kid,
everyone said it couldn't be done.

345
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:21,657
My whole life, people have been telling
me what I could do and couldn't do.

346
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:28,165
I've always listened to them,
believed in what they said.

347
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,037
I don't want to do that anymore.

348
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:36,708
Okay, Mr. Rudy.

349
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:39,643
Here's the deaI...

350
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:45,785
...Holy Cross Junior College is nearby.
I can get you one semester there.

351
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,223
You make grades,
you get another semester.

352
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:51,023
Maybe with a good GPA...

353
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:54,633
...you might have a chance
of getting into Notre Dame.

354
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:42,422
Hey, kid!

355
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:45,759
You're not supposed to be here!

356
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:49,997
Hey, this place is really
something else, huh?

357
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:53,937
Someday, I'm gonna come out of that
tunneI and run onto this field!

358
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:59,275
Well, it ain't gonna be this day.

359
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,781
I'm here to play football
for the Irish.

360
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:05,087
Coach Parseghian know about it?

361
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:10,622
No, not yet.

362
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:14,629
Well, maybe you best tell him first.

363
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,429
Yeah, you're right.

364
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:19,234
Yeah, that's what I should do.

365
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,001
Thanks.

366
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:22,941
I'll see you around.

367
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:27,342
Is he expecting you?

368
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,096
This'll just take a second.

369
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:30,779
- Now just a moment-
- Coach?

370
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:34,886
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- I'm sorry, coach, I tried.

371
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:38,957
- No, it's all right. I've got it.
- Shall I close the door?

372
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:43,194
- How can I help you, son?
- I'm Rudy Ruettiger.

373
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:46,099
I'm here to talk about playing
football for Notre Dame.

374
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:49,134
Our walk-on tryout date
was two weeks ago.

375
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:53,708
I'm not talking about this year.
I was thinking about next springtime.

376
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:55,943
Are you a student here?

377
00:31:55,978 --> 00:32:00,080
No. I'm at Holy Cross.
But I'm gonna be a student here.

378
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:05,822
I've been a Notre Dame fan for as long
as I can remember, since I was little.

379
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:10,328
In high schooI, I started-
Is it all right if I sit down?

380
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:14,164
In high schooI,
I started at cornerback.

381
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:18,571
I wasn't the quickest guy on the team
or the biggest...

382
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:20,773
...but I lead in tackles.

383
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:23,242
But anyway...

384
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,480
...I've been working at a steeI mill
for about four years.

385
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:28,982
And I've been saving up my money.

386
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:33,053
And I've been planning on
coming here. But...

387
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:36,092
My friend Pete really understood
what my dream was.

388
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:39,463
And he told me not to
waste any more time.

389
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:42,799
But I don't know.
For some reason, I couldn't-

390
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:46,171
See, he died in an accident on Friday.

391
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:49,507
And I came here right after
the funeraI.

392
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,076
You see what I mean?

393
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:53,477
Son...

394
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:56,116
...I think you're in the wrong office.

395
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,617
Come on, now.

396
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:00,051
I don't understand.

397
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:03,456
You might want to go and talk
to Father Cavanaugh.

398
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:07,329
I talked to Father Cavanaugh.
He got me into Holy Cross.

399
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,528
He did?

400
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:11,666
He said that if I got good enough
grades at Holy Cross-

401
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:18,474
- and I will, I promise- that
I'd be admitted here officially.

402
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:23,415
I just wanted to introduce myself and
say I look forward to practice.

403
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,987
- Thank you.
- So long.

404
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:30,190
Sorry.

405
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,562
For us, divine inspiration does not
mean that God possesses a man...

406
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,033
...and simply dictates
the inspired text to him.

407
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,266
Rather...

408
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:44,740
...that God implants into a man's mind
the generaI concept.

409
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,173
When God does that...

410
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:50,046
...He allows the man to write that
in his historicaI context.

411
00:33:50,081 --> 00:33:53,883
The sitz im leben, or,
"That is the setting in life. "

412
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:57,288
So a man may have
historicaI inaccuracies...

413
00:33:57,323 --> 00:34:00,359
...but God allows
those misunderstandings...

414
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:03,360
...because what is important
and inherent...

415
00:34:03,395 --> 00:34:06,933
...is the theologicaI concept that
God is getting across to mankind.

416
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,200
I think that's all for today.

417
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:14,108
We will have a quiz on Monday,
so please prepare yourselves for it.

418
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:16,243
Well done, Father.

419
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:18,144
Please grade these for me.

420
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,685
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Certainly.

421
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,788
You learning stenography or what?

422
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,459
Everything he's mouthing
is in the book.

423
00:34:29,494 --> 00:34:31,593
I gotta make an A in this class.

424
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,805
Just remember your sitz im leben,
and it shouldn't be a problem.

425
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:44,844
I'm not talking to you, man.
Not after what you did.

426
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,145
You brought a girI to meet me...

427
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,418
...and the next thing you know,
she sits next to Brian-

428
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:52,354
Hi, could you hold this?

429
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,221
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

430
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:57,325
So you're interested
in a room to rent?

431
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,792
I don't know. Maybe.

432
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:01,898
My brother has a house about
five blocks from campus.

433
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,400
I'm sick and tired of-

434
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,738
- I have an extra card I can give you.
- Just forget it.

435
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,944
So if you're interested,
call soon.

436
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:16,352
Maybe tonight. All right, bye.

437
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:24,324
You don't have a goddamn clue, do you?

438
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,357
About what?

439
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:28,196
About how to get an A in that class.

440
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:30,596
I could help you.

441
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:34,069
Look, besides being an honor student
at Notre Dame...

442
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:37,941
...and a TA in Father-

443
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:41,743
I'm also a tutor for hire.

444
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:45,548
I can't even afford a room to rent.

445
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:49,454
Wait, maybe we can make
some other kind of deaI.

446
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,423
What kind of deaI?

447
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,896
Well...

448
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:00,501
...I got Notre Dame pretty well
staked out.

449
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,135
Staked out?

450
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,135
Girls.

451
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,106
- I don't know here-
- Excuse me.

452
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:08,174
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

453
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,678
I don't know the girls
here at Holy Cross.

454
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:13,516
- What's your point?
- Well, maybe you could...

455
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:14,516
What?

456
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:19,824
- Introduce me to a few-
- I don't know any girls here.

457
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:21,863
So be it.

458
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,732
Wait a minute.

459
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,566
Hey, wait!

460
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,603
Hey, wait a minute.

461
00:36:31,638 --> 00:36:33,690
Maybe I do know some girls.

462
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,707
In fact, I know a lot of girls.

463
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:38,662
- I just gotta find them.
- That's the spirit.

464
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,583
As you can see, I'm pretty
goddamn desperate.

465
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:42,816
I'm D-Bob.

466
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,018
- Rudy.
- And I'm in love.

467
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:47,957
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't say anything.

468
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:50,860
Pretty sweater you're wearing.
This is D-Bob.

469
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:53,347
He's feeling not well.

470
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:55,764
Will you cut it out?

471
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,301
Branski twisted his knee.

472
00:36:57,336 --> 00:36:59,002
He's not gonna make-

473
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:02,206
- Is this the practice field?
- All practices are closed.

474
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:03,908
- I know Coach Parseghian.
- Are you-

475
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:09,482
- I talked to him the other day.
- Watch out.

476
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:13,022
- Step back, okay?
- All right.

477
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:20,727
Hey, coach!

478
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:25,802
You gotta keep your eyes open
around here, kid.

479
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,902
Hey, coach!

480
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:29,772
Coach Parseghian...

481
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:33,112
...anything I can do to help the team,
you just let me know.

482
00:37:35,113 --> 00:37:36,725
See you.

483
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:49,463
- Who's that?
- Your lunch breaks are too long.

484
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:50,963
Go plug in the end zone.

485
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:54,567
- Tell Jake I need to talk to him.
- All right, boss.

486
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:59,875
- What did I tell you about trespassing?
- You're the guy I need to talk to.

487
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,811
- I need your help.
- Why should I help you?

488
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:06,715
- I want to be your assistant.
- I've got a full crew.

489
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,488
Couldn't you use somebody else?
I mean, I'll work for free.

490
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,421
What's in it for you?

491
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,894
I volunteered to help the team
do anything I can, but...

492
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,464
...I can't, because I'm not
a student here.

493
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:20,198
But I will be.

494
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:24,438
I figured if I'm gonna play here,
I need to know the lay of the land.

495
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,971
You're nuts.

496
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:27,806
I've heard that a lot.

497
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:33,882
Well, you've got to be nuts
to want to work for nothing.

498
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,792
I just want to be a part
of this university.

499
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:44,893
Okay.

500
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:47,999
Meet me here tomorrow, 10 a. m.

501
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,988
- Thanks.
- Minimum wage.

502
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:55,907
- Thanks again.
- All right.

503
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:58,511
Did you understand what
I was trying to say?

504
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,744
You don't understand.

505
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,183
- Let me give you a hand.
- Are you sure?

506
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:04,919
- No problem. Here.
- I got it.

507
00:39:04,954 --> 00:39:07,587
- Keep it straight, kid.
- Okay.

508
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:11,093
- Poet. Scholar.
- Dickinson. Dickinson.

509
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:13,961
Hut, hut. Blue and gold, let's go.

510
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,297
- Hi there, what's your name?
- Donna.

511
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:21,236
- Great. My name's Rudy Ruettiger.
- Hi, I'm Colleen.

512
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:24,776
- I've got this buddy, D-Bob.
- D-Bob with the two watches?

513
00:39:24,811 --> 00:39:26,609
Mr. Marshall Fields?

514
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:30,816
- His name's D-Bob. He's a sweetheart.
- Well, maybe I'll see you around.

515
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:37,057
- No, I have class.
- I sit behind you in 235.

516
00:39:37,092 --> 00:39:41,794
- Two watches!
- Two watches!

517
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:46,535
Don't waste time reading the question
if it's a long test in a short period.

518
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,736
- All right.
- Two of them will be similar.

519
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:52,108
It'll be one of those two.
One's absurd. Forget that one.

520
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:53,975
- This is important.
- "Increase...

521
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,814
- ... in psychologicaI responses. "
- What do you think?

522
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,280
Excuse me.

523
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,586
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
I just have to ask you...

524
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:04,087
...have we met somewhere before?

525
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:06,562
You know, you look
really familiar to me.

526
00:40:09,562 --> 00:40:12,500
Maybe psych class. Do you have psych
on Monday, Wednesday, Friday?

527
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,337
I'm in there at 10:00.

528
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:18,972
Yeah, he's in that class.

529
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:22,211
I bet that's where.
I knew you looked familiar.

530
00:40:22,246 --> 00:40:24,799
Well, anyway, this is kind of
embarrassing, but...

531
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:27,353
...you heard about the dance
on Saturday night, right?

532
00:40:31,354 --> 00:40:33,322
- Right?
- Yeah, we've heard about it.

533
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:37,433
Okay. All right, well, I was just
wondering, do you have any plans?

534
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:47,173
- That's great. So you're available?
- D-Bob would love to go.

535
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,074
Really? This is so great.

536
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:53,415
I would love to introduce you
to my roommate, Elza.

537
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:56,560
Elza, come here.

538
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:10,267
D- Bob was suspicious, so he made me go
to a language lab to take these tests.

539
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,369
They said I had a slight case
of dyslexia.

540
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:17,910
It's when the words get mixed up
in your head when you're reading.

541
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:22,214
I'm doing exercises to help me, and...

542
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:27,255
- ... I got an A on a literature test.
- That's great, kid.

543
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,889
Hey, do you live in here?

544
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:32,226
Believe it or not, got my own home.

545
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,763
That cot's for when
my sciatica acts up.

546
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:37,999
Okay, let's go to work.

547
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:40,303
See that hose on top of the locker?

548
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:41,956
Bring that with you.

549
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,695
So you're in student housing?

550
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,029
Huh?

551
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,367
No, I'm living with a friend in town.

552
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:09,168
Where in town?

553
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:14,443
- I haven't found a place to stay yet.
- Funds pretty low, huh?

554
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,679
All my savings went for tuition.

555
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:20,081
I shower at Holy Cross.
I'm all right.

556
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:23,152
- So this is it, huh?
- This is where it starts and finishes.

557
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:57,125
"I've gotta go, Rock.

558
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,862
It's all right. I'm not afraid.

559
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:02,098
Sometime, when the team's
in trouble...

560
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:06,605
...and things are wrong and the breaks
are beating the boys...

561
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,228
...tell them to go in there and
win just one for the Gipper.

562
00:43:11,263 --> 00:43:15,816
I don't know where I'll be then, Rock,
but I'll know about it...

563
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:18,260
...and I'll be happy. "

564
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:28,264
The Four Horsemen.

565
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:31,018
Knute Rockne.

566
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:33,179
Moose Krause.

567
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,210
Angelo Bertelli.

568
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,173
Johnny Lujack.

569
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:41,046
Leon Hart, Terry Hanratty, Jack Snow.

570
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:42,953
John Lattner.

571
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:51,358
PauI Hornung could've dressed
in this locker.

572
00:43:51,393 --> 00:43:53,606
We got work to do, kid.

573
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:08,310
"We're gonna go inside.
We're gonna go outside.

574
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,283
We're gonna get them on the run.
We're gonna keep them on the run.

575
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,117
Then we're gonna go, go, go, go, go!

576
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,953
We won't stop untiI we're across
that goaI line.

577
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:22,228
This is a team they say is good.
Well, I think we're better than them.

578
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:24,866
They can't lick us.

579
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:27,469
What do you say, men?"

580
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:05,212
By the way, Gipper,
I got your gym card.

581
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,079
- Great!
- Wait, we had a deaI.

582
00:45:07,114 --> 00:45:10,886
- I do your laundry for two months.
- This was hard to get.

583
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,490
- It's gonna be a semester.
- Of doing your laundry?

584
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:16,491
- Come on, let me see.
- A semester.

585
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:19,532
All right, fine.
Just let me see the card.

586
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:25,103
- Come on, that's impossible.
- It's your job to give it a shot.

587
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:27,422
She's out of our league.

588
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:29,673
Tell her I'm a Fields.

589
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:33,388
As in Marshall Fields. She'll know.
Just tell her that, please.

590
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,461
That looks great.
I think you'll really enjoy it.

591
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:50,533
Hi, are you interested in joining
a student activity?

592
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:56,138
Here's your choices.

593
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:59,875
Do you see that guy over there?
Over by the pillar.

594
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,449
Could you wave at him a little bit?
Just kind of humor him.

595
00:46:04,484 --> 00:46:06,224
Please?

596
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:14,261
That was perfect. Thank you.

597
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:15,627
Well?

598
00:46:15,662 --> 00:46:19,065
Choir looks good. I used to sing
in the high schooI choir.

599
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,038
- What's Football Boosters?
- We organize the pep rallies and...

600
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:26,141
...paint the helmets
the night before the game.

601
00:46:26,176 --> 00:46:28,629
The actuaI football helmets?
You guys-

602
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:31,081
That's definitely me.
Where do I sign?

603
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:34,250
Right here.

604
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:38,322
You are a student
at Notre Dame, right?

605
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:40,593
Yeah. Why, don't I look like one?

606
00:46:40,628 --> 00:46:42,793
Oh, no, we're just supposed to ask.

607
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:47,033
Yeah, I'm Notre Dame gold and blue,
through and through.

608
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:51,238
The first meeting is tomorrow night
at the ACC, 7:00.

609
00:46:51,273 --> 00:46:54,440
- See you there.
- All right, bye.

610
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:57,078
Like to sign up
for a student activity?

611
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:59,112
- Strike?
- Out.

612
00:46:59,147 --> 00:47:02,418
She has a boyfriend
who's on the football team.

613
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:05,688
- You looked like you were in.
- Well, I'm sorry.

614
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,427
You look awfuI goddamn
happy about this.

615
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,065
Thank you.

616
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:16,436
- Did you get the field passes?
- Chuck hasn't given them to me yet.

617
00:47:18,137 --> 00:47:19,940
Mary.

618
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,816
Mary!

619
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:31,930
- Watch yourself.
- Oh! Sorry.

620
00:47:42,632 --> 00:47:44,466
Hey...

621
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:46,268
...isn't this fantastic?

622
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:48,737
There's 24-karat gold in the paint!

623
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:52,542
- What's your name again?
- Rudy Ruettiger.

624
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:57,817
I need your student I.D.
to get your card section pass.

625
00:47:57,852 --> 00:48:00,118
I don't have it now,
but I'm gonna get it.

626
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:04,358
- I'll have it by tomorrow.
- I gotta send the names in tonight.

627
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:08,030
Couldn't you let it slide this once?

628
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:11,632
It's the rules, sorry. Next game.

629
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:15,270
Are you gonna come to Corby's?
It's where we all go afterwards.

630
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:17,422
Yeah, I'll be there. Thanks.

631
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:37,296
Is that Bob Gladieux and Ron Dushney
sitting at the end of the bar?

632
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,366
- How about another one?
- Sure.

633
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:43,803
Now, that's a game to remember:
1966 against Michigan State.

634
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:49,145
Gladieux caught the greatest pass
in Notre Dame football history.

635
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,144
Hey!

636
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:55,485
"Mary, Mary quite contrary,
what makes your garden grow?"

637
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,755
Excuse me, could I get change
for a dollar, please?

638
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,709
Thank you.

639
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:02,592
You all right?

640
00:49:02,627 --> 00:49:07,666
Yeah. I just wanted to say
it's been a pleasure working with you.

641
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:08,665
Thanks.

642
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,306
You said before you were the greatest
Notre Dame football fan in history.

643
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:18,563
I thought I was, so I guess that
means we got something in common.

644
00:49:18,598 --> 00:49:23,785
In fact, I'm gonna be playing football
for the Irish next fall.

645
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,320
I've talked to Coach Parseghian
about it.

646
00:49:26,355 --> 00:49:30,059
You see, I'm at Holy Cross for
a semester, maybe two at the most.

647
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:32,880
Father Cavanaugh says
if I make the grades...

648
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:35,631
...I'll have a reaI good shot
at getting in.

649
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:40,038
And for the first time in my life,
my grades have been really good.

650
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:44,143
You're not a Notre Dame student?

651
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:45,176
Not officially.

652
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:48,882
- But I will be next semester.
- You can't be a part of the Boosters.

653
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:51,569
- I'm sorry.
- Mary, wait a minute.

654
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:54,187
Will you please forget I said that?

655
00:49:54,222 --> 00:49:57,358
- You know what a tremendous fan I am.
- It's the rules.

656
00:49:57,393 --> 00:50:00,629
I know, but-

657
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,763
Damn!

658
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,046
- Mister, I got 10 bucks for a ticket.
- Ten bucks? You're 90 short.

659
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,218
- Kid, can I buy that ticket from you?
- Yeah, for 20 bucks.

660
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:53,125
- Please, can I get in? I got $10.
- I couldn't do it. I'd lose my job.

661
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,558
Really.

662
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,730
I'd like to, buddy.

663
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:07,312
- hands off to Eric Penick
for the Notre Dame touchdown.

664
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:13,513
Do you have an extra ticket? Please?

665
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:16,103
- One ticket. I just need one seat.
- I'm sorry, no.

666
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:39,063
Point after attempt is good. Score:
Irish, 7, Northwestern, nothing.

667
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,718
Fortune, did you see Eric Penick's
kickoff return yesterday?

668
00:53:07,753 --> 00:53:09,418
I saw it on TV.

669
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:12,055
He broke free right about here.

670
00:53:12,091 --> 00:53:15,260
The 40. The 35. The 30!

671
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:18,395
The 25! The 20! The 15!

672
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,272
The 10! The 5! Touchdown Irish!

673
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:30,211
Hey, hey, hey, we got work to do.

674
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:32,551
Down, set, hut!

675
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:41,422
- You ever see a game from in here?
- Nope.

676
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:47,798
Well, then your first game
will be one I'm playing in.

677
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:54,139
Whatever you say, kid.
You gonna watch me or help me?

678
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:56,642
Thanks for the blanket and the key.

679
00:53:56,677 --> 00:53:59,862
I don't know nothing about it.

680
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:03,049
Then who put the key on the cot?

681
00:54:03,084 --> 00:54:06,454
You hear what I just said?

682
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:07,803
Yeah.

683
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:25,743
AII B's.

684
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:29,146
And an A.

685
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:32,050
I know my grades have gone down,
Father, but...

686
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:34,921
...I have a lot of
extracurricular activities.

687
00:54:34,956 --> 00:54:37,522
You did a good job, kid.

688
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:43,096
Admissions people, you never can tell.
They're a funny bunch of squirrels.

689
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:45,522
Have I done all I can?

690
00:55:07,326 --> 00:55:08,625
Excuse me.

691
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,869
Hi, I need box 620, please.

692
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,183
Thank you.

693
00:55:28,985 --> 00:55:32,154
"Dear Mr. Ruettiger,
Your application for admission...

694
00:55:32,189 --> 00:55:35,005
...to the University of Notre Dame
has been evaluated by... "

695
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,254
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

696
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:05,094
Tommy, where did you get that?
Oh, you're all sticky.

697
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,735
Rudy!

698
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,770
Where have you been for so long?

699
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:18,708
I've been going to college
at Holy Cross. It's in South Bend.

700
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:22,581
If you're going to Holy Cross,
why do you have a Notre Dame jacket?

701
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:25,584
- I'll go there next year.
- Then that's where I'll go too!

702
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,560
Do you want something to eat?

703
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:38,100
An A and three B's.

704
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:41,172
Good for you.

705
00:56:43,873 --> 00:56:48,028
I didn't make it into Notre Dame this
semester. I saw a few home games.

706
00:56:48,063 --> 00:56:52,183
I thought about you. You'd have loved
it. You gotta come over for a game.

707
00:56:52,218 --> 00:56:53,951
It's so exciting. You've-

708
00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:57,656
I watch the games here on
my television. That's fine for me.

709
00:56:57,691 --> 00:57:03,596
I know, but it's not the same thing.

710
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:05,164
What if I were in the game?

711
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,733
Jesus, we still have
to listen to this crap?

712
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:10,372
That semester at college
didn't make you smarter.

713
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:13,525
I'm glad you made good grades.

714
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,087
Come on, Johnny. Please tell me.

715
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:18,614
It wouldn't be a surprise if I tell.

716
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:20,884
You can do better than that.

717
00:57:20,919 --> 00:57:24,319
Okay, one more hint.

718
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,675
Hey, Johnny-boy, aren't you gonna
wish your brother a merry Christmas?

719
00:57:44,078 --> 00:57:47,249
How you doing, Rudy?

720
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:49,683
Fine.

721
00:57:49,718 --> 00:57:55,391
I just want to tell you that
you going to college and all...

722
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:58,128
...I think that's great.

723
00:57:58,163 --> 00:58:04,167
Thanks, Johnny.

724
00:58:04,202 --> 00:58:06,843
I'll be in the kitchen.

725
00:58:11,844 --> 00:58:14,846
I gotta go.

726
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:16,917
Why don't you stay for a while?

727
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,552
I have to go to work.

728
00:58:18,587 --> 00:58:20,553
Rudy, I'm sorry.

729
00:58:20,588 --> 00:58:23,560
I just want to tell you that
I hope you make it. I do.

730
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,406
Hi.

731
00:59:01,441 --> 00:59:03,247
Hi.

732
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:13,950
Twelve o'clock. Closing time.

733
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:16,760
- Thanks, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- You're welcome.

734
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:24,351
Thanks.

735
00:59:45,355 --> 00:59:49,159
Vacation, that's all I hear from you.
"I'm gonna go on vacation. "

736
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:51,796
After this game you're gonna
pay my money, right?

737
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:56,702
What about the end of the month?

738
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:58,554
TotaI failure.

739
00:59:58,589 --> 01:00:00,337
Everything I did.

740
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:05,449
Work, the studying, four hours
a night's sleep in a dungeon.

741
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:12,053
I've blown another year
of eligibility.

742
01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:14,056
This entire year's been a waste.

743
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:16,523
A waste, huh?

744
01:00:16,558 --> 01:00:20,546
You got your head so far up your ass
about that damn football team...

745
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:24,535
...you don't get that you just got
one year of top-quality education.

746
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,535
"Waste. "

747
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:31,741
Don't be wasting my time.

748
01:00:31,776 --> 01:00:34,362
Ain't you got some work to do?

749
01:00:50,165 --> 01:00:52,708
First three chapters for next week.
Start thinking about those.

750
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:01,734
Thank you.

751
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:02,817
We gotta do
our own cooking and laundry.

752
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:04,152
We gotta do
our own cooking and laundry.

753
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,389
I'm not very good at that either.

754
01:02:06,424 --> 01:02:08,592
You gonna invite me?

755
01:02:08,627 --> 01:02:10,726
You'll be the first one.

756
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:14,998
- First? I'm gonna be the guinea pig?
- If you live through it, why...

757
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:16,810
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

758
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:28,849
Taking your appeaI to a higher court.

759
01:02:28,884 --> 01:02:30,716
I'm desperate.

760
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:34,122
If I don't get in next semester,
it's over, done.

761
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:40,127
Notre Dame doesn't accept
senior transfers.

762
01:02:40,162 --> 01:02:44,666
Well, you did a hell of a job, kid,
chasing down your dream.

763
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:50,508
I don't care. If it doesn't produce
results, it doesn't mean anything.

764
01:02:50,543 --> 01:02:55,380
I think you'll discover that it will.

765
01:02:55,415 --> 01:02:58,167
Maybe I haven't prayed enough.

766
01:02:58,202 --> 01:03:00,885
I'm sure that's not the problem.

767
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,356
Praying is something
we do in our time.

768
01:03:03,391 --> 01:03:06,925
The answers come in God's time.

769
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,937
Have I done everything I possibly can?
Can you help me?

770
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:18,939
Son, in 35 years
of religious studies...

771
01:03:18,974 --> 01:03:22,946
...I've come up with only
two hard, incontrovertible facts:

772
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:25,593
There is a God...

773
01:03:25,628 --> 01:03:28,207
...and I'm not Him.

774
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:51,754
Is there anything in box 620, please?

775
01:04:32,762 --> 01:04:36,565
"- has been approved.

776
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,783
You've been accepted as a freshman
for the fall semester... "

777
01:04:52,786 --> 01:04:54,807
Oh, thank God.

778
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,879
What's wrong?

779
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:17,055
Read it.

780
01:05:24,056 --> 01:05:26,200
"Congratulations, you are... "

781
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:36,938
I did it.

782
01:05:36,973 --> 01:05:39,958
You did it.

783
01:05:39,993 --> 01:05:42,637
You did it.

784
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,246
Hey, guys.

785
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:48,201
My son's going to Notre Dame.

786
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,121
All right, Rudy. Way to go!

787
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,590
Hey, you guys!

788
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,429
My son's going to Notre Dame!

789
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:02,034
You hear that, Johnny?
Your brother's going to Notre Dame.

790
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:04,204
Can you believe it, Frank?

791
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:05,904
Congratulations.

792
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:10,247
So, listen, you wanna work
till it's time to go to schooI?

793
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:14,556
I gotta get back, Pop.
Football tryouts start this week.

794
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:23,711
I'll call you.

795
01:06:40,714 --> 01:06:44,317
One, two, three...

796
01:06:44,352 --> 01:06:47,922
...four, five, six...

797
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:50,138
...seven, eight!

798
01:07:04,141 --> 01:07:07,713
Let me tell it to you
as clean as I can.

799
01:07:07,748 --> 01:07:09,513
We have 95 players here...

800
01:07:09,548 --> 01:07:12,383
...so accomplished
as athletes in high school...

801
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:16,956
...they have full scholarships to the
best football program in the country.

802
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:21,462
NCAA regulations allow us
to dress just 60 for home games...

803
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:24,333
...which means at least
35 scholarship players...

804
01:07:24,368 --> 01:07:27,168
...will be watching the game
from the stands.

805
01:07:27,203 --> 01:07:29,804
So if any of you has any fantasies...

806
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:34,077
...about running out of that tunneI
with your helmet shining in the sun...

807
01:07:34,112 --> 01:07:36,111
...you best leave them right here.

808
01:07:36,146 --> 01:07:41,184
Of you 15 dreamers out there,
maybe we'll keep one or two.

809
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:46,125
My job is to basically beat the shit
out of you for the next five days.

810
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,745
And whoever is still
standing at the end...

811
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,296
...maybe we'll use
for our scout teams.

812
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:55,402
You'll be running the opposition's plays
week in and week out.

813
01:07:55,437 --> 01:07:59,438
Your greatest value to us is,
we don't care whether you get hurt.

814
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:05,046
Our first teams are gonna pound on you
like you're their worst enemies.

815
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,382
Like what you hear so far?

816
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:13,957
Any of you want to run home to Mama?
Now's your chance.

817
01:08:13,992 --> 01:08:16,425
Joe, they're all yours.

818
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,532
Don't just stand there trying to
think. Let's hit those ropes. Move it!

819
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:24,003
Move it, I said! Come on!

820
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:28,775
Pick them up, pick them up! High
knees! Let's go, gentlemen, let's go!

821
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,228
Pump your arms,
keep your heads up.

822
01:08:31,263 --> 01:08:33,613
That's it, don't step on that rope!

823
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:38,052
Up and down, let's go!
We want to see how quick you are here.

824
01:08:38,087 --> 01:08:41,040
Keep it rolling, keep it rolling.

825
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,958
Heads up, keep moving, keep moving.

826
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:47,297
Pump those arms, pump those arms
when you're backwards running.

827
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,732
Move it, move it, move it!

828
01:08:49,767 --> 01:08:51,869
Keep your heads up,
keep your heads up!

829
01:08:51,904 --> 01:08:54,255
Run!

830
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:13,568
Get in there, Ruettiger,
get in there!

831
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:25,075
All right, let's concentrate
and get it right.

832
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,457
Go hard, charge him.

833
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:42,412
What is that?
What are you doing? Come on!

834
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:45,366
Who has the play?
Who wants to do it right?

835
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:49,312
All right, stay low.

836
01:09:57,313 --> 01:10:00,682
Come on, let's do it again!

837
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:03,620
- Get out of here.
- Coach, I can do it.

838
01:10:03,655 --> 01:10:05,804
Oh, yeah? All right, we'll see.

839
01:10:19,806 --> 01:10:22,376
This is where we separate
the men from the girls.

840
01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:24,125
30, hit the spot.

841
01:10:38,128 --> 01:10:39,903
Get in there. Now pick him off.
Pick him off, damn it!

842
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:55,353
Relax for a few minutes.

843
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:02,622
If it was up to me,
I'd get rid of all of them.

844
01:11:02,657 --> 01:11:05,461
If they can't protect themselves,
I don't want them.

845
01:11:05,496 --> 01:11:06,929
The kid with blood on him.

846
01:11:06,964 --> 01:11:08,462
Ruettiger?

847
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,166
Have you been watching?
No athletic skill.

848
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:15,589
- He's put more effort than anybody.
- You fellows decide.

849
01:11:15,624 --> 01:11:19,978
Not in my defensive backfield.
You want him, you got him.

850
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:25,551
All right, shower up.
We'll let you know.

851
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:28,071
You think you made it?

852
01:11:28,106 --> 01:11:30,521
Unfortunately, yeah.

853
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:33,293
What is so unfortunate
about making the team?

854
01:11:33,328 --> 01:11:35,461
This is my third year as a walk-on.

855
01:11:35,496 --> 01:11:38,399
I had scholarships
to two Big Ten schools.

856
01:11:38,434 --> 01:11:41,302
But my father was
an all-American here...

857
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:43,606
...so I get a lot of family pressure.

858
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:45,206
I don't understand.

859
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:48,111
If you haven't been cut,
then you still have a chance.

860
01:11:48,146 --> 01:11:50,712
- What, a chance to play?
- Yeah.

861
01:11:50,747 --> 01:11:54,452
The only reason they keep me on
here is because I'm a legacy.

862
01:11:54,487 --> 01:11:57,455
To them I'm no more valuable
than a tackling dummy.

863
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,358
Ruettiger, come with me.

864
01:11:59,393 --> 01:12:01,992
Yeah, coach.

865
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,997
You want on the team pretty bad.

866
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,764
You have no idea.

867
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:09,203
- You sure busted your balls out there.
- Coach, I'll do anything.

868
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:11,504
You think you can give
the same effort...

869
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:13,709
...day in and day out
for the next five months?

870
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:16,543
Sir, I have no doubt.

871
01:12:16,578 --> 01:12:21,382
Fine.
If you do lighten up one hair...

872
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:26,690
...I'll throw you off this team
so fast you won't know what hit you.

873
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:27,856
Wait a minute.

874
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,828
Throw me off? That means
I gotta be on the team first.

875
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:33,765
- Don't let me down.
- Does that mean I'm on the team?

876
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,068
- Yeah, kid, you're on the team.
- Thank you!

877
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:38,064
Hey, hey, come on.

878
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:40,026
Go put some shoes on.

879
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:04,500
Thanks for everything.

880
01:13:04,535 --> 01:13:06,435
What's that?

881
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:10,008
It's the key to the maintenance room.

882
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:13,317
Don't know nothing about it.

883
01:13:18,017 --> 01:13:23,656
Yeah...

884
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,103
You promised. You'll come see
your first game if I ever dress.

885
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:41,012
Well, I'll stop by every now
and again, just to bother you.

886
01:13:41,047 --> 01:13:43,414
See you later.

887
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:46,416
Hey, kid.

888
01:13:46,451 --> 01:13:49,139
You ever dress...

889
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,828
...I'll be there.

890
01:15:29,573 --> 01:15:32,276
Run it again.
Sloppy, for chrissake!

891
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:33,510
38 counter.

892
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:37,215
The back missed the hole.
He's gotta go to the outside.

893
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,520
You all right, man?
Come on, get up.

894
01:15:40,555 --> 01:15:43,791
- Get in the huddle.
- Ruettiger!

895
01:15:43,826 --> 01:15:46,212
Ruettiger, get out.

896
01:15:46,247 --> 01:15:48,598
I can do it, coach!

897
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,449
- Ready?
- Let's go, fellas.

898
01:16:07,452 --> 01:16:08,951
What are you doing?

899
01:16:08,986 --> 01:16:15,260
Don't treat me like your kid brother.
I'm playing defense for Purdue.

900
01:16:15,295 --> 01:16:18,298
You ain't here to be no nanny
in no kindergarten!

901
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:21,514
- Now, go play ball.
- Hit me, man.

902
01:16:33,516 --> 01:16:34,918
Red 40!

903
01:16:35,918 --> 01:16:37,864
Red 40!

904
01:16:47,365 --> 01:16:49,841
Keep your ass down.

905
01:16:56,743 --> 01:16:59,112
So on Eagle,
do I go on "set" or "2"?

906
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,581
You gotta go on "set. "
You gotta pick the man up.

907
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:04,887
On Eagle Slant, do I let him slide
or do I pick him up too?

908
01:17:04,922 --> 01:17:07,955
Hey, little buddy! Hold up, man.

909
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:11,259
I'm not talking to you.
You keep going.

910
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,330
I'm sorry about
what happened at practice today.

911
01:17:14,365 --> 01:17:16,198
Don't be sorry.

912
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:20,002
If you don't cooI it out there,
you'll get yourself killed.

913
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:27,346
If I cooI it, I won't be helping you
get ready for the games. Got it?

914
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:29,380
I got it.

915
01:17:29,415 --> 01:17:32,553
He's just a showboat, man.
That's all he's about.

916
01:17:32,588 --> 01:17:35,460
He's just doing his job, Jamie.
Can it.

917
01:18:18,707 --> 01:18:20,590
- Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, here we go.

918
01:18:34,592 --> 01:18:36,764
What are you doing, huh?

919
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:40,265
Break it up!

920
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,633
Get off me!

921
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:44,803
Come on, Ruettiger!

922
01:18:44,838 --> 01:18:47,507
Break it up, I said. And cooI down.

923
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:51,279
You brown-nosed suck-ass!
You suck ass!

924
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:53,614
What's your problem, O'Hare?

925
01:18:53,649 --> 01:18:57,252
Last practice and this asshole
thinks it's the Super BowI.

926
01:18:57,287 --> 01:19:01,491
You just summed up
your entire sorry career here...

927
01:19:01,526 --> 01:19:03,292
...in one sentence!

928
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:07,031
If you had a tenth of Ruettiger's heart,
you'd have made all-American.

929
01:19:07,066 --> 01:19:09,935
As it is, you just went
from third team to prep team.

930
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:12,571
Go on, get out of here.
Get me another tailback.

931
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,641
- Huddle!
- Let's run it.

932
01:19:16,676 --> 01:19:18,846
- Huddle!
- Let's go. Defense, come on out.

933
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:24,351
Rudy, I want you to ice this
twice more in your room tonight.

934
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:25,718
We'll see you tomorrow.

935
01:19:25,753 --> 01:19:29,161
Keep that pack on that shoulder
for at least 15 more minutes.

936
01:19:33,762 --> 01:19:36,298
Hey, Jim.

937
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:40,470
Your bullshit out there makes us
look bad, so diaI it down a notch.

938
01:19:40,505 --> 01:19:41,470
DiaI it down?

939
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:45,509
Everybody's sick and tired of hearing,
"Put out more like Ruettiger. "

940
01:19:45,544 --> 01:19:49,314
What do you get out of
getting your head kicked in?

941
01:19:49,349 --> 01:19:50,981
It's not worth it, you know?

942
01:19:51,016 --> 01:19:53,853
You gotta be in at least one play
during a game...

943
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:56,822
...to officially be part of this team.

944
01:19:56,857 --> 01:20:00,995
The only uniform you'll put on is
that grungy thing you've been wearing.

945
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:05,200
If you hate it so much,
why don't you just quit?

946
01:20:05,235 --> 01:20:08,021
I can't.

947
01:20:08,056 --> 01:20:10,771
Why not?

948
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,848
If I quit, my father
won't pay my tuition.

949
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:21,523
Is that why you're here?

950
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:30,409
I'm under the delusion that I might
get a chance to run out that tunneI.

951
01:20:42,911 --> 01:20:45,046
Does he think I'm Iying to him?

952
01:20:45,081 --> 01:20:47,148
Nobody said nothing about Iying.

953
01:20:47,183 --> 01:20:50,486
I have to get pictures taken
of practice to prove I'm on the team?

954
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:51,820
I believe you.

955
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:54,723
What happened to my face?
Where did I get these?

956
01:20:54,758 --> 01:20:58,561
- So you're a glorified waterboy.
- Oh, you just don't get it.

957
01:20:58,596 --> 01:21:02,568
If you are on that team, my opinion
of Notre Dame just hit the shits.

958
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:03,820
Leave him alone.

959
01:21:03,855 --> 01:21:05,002
There's no "if. "

960
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:08,642
I wear a uniform, I block and tackle.
You just don't understand.

961
01:21:08,677 --> 01:21:09,941
Actually, it's simple.

962
01:21:09,976 --> 01:21:12,879
Every Saturday when we turn on
the TV to watch...

963
01:21:12,914 --> 01:21:17,418
...we see players wearing the blue
and gold. We just don't see you.

964
01:21:17,453 --> 01:21:18,752
You will.

965
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:20,689
- What?
- You will. Now shoot.

966
01:21:20,724 --> 01:21:22,330
Just shoot.

967
01:21:28,332 --> 01:21:32,636
Coach, Rudy Ruettiger's
here to see you.

968
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,781
Send him in.

969
01:21:43,182 --> 01:21:45,751
This won't take long, coach.

970
01:21:45,786 --> 01:21:49,924
First, I'd like to thank you for
the opportunity of being on the team.

971
01:21:49,959 --> 01:21:52,292
I never thought I'd be saying this...

972
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:56,849
...but it's been a pleasure.
Now what can I do for you?

973
01:21:56,884 --> 01:22:01,336
Well, one of the many things
that I've learned this year...

974
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:05,875
...is that no matter how hard I try,
I'll never get above the prep team.

975
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:10,381
I've accepted that God made some
people football players, but not me.

976
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:15,357
I wish God would put your heart
in some of my players' bodies.

977
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:22,763
My father loves Notre Dame football
more than anything else in the world.

978
01:22:22,798 --> 01:22:25,030
He doesn't believe I'm on the team...

979
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,435
...because he can't see me
during the games.

980
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:33,693
Next year, my senior year, I'd love
to be able to give him this gift:

981
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:38,916
I'd really appreciate it if you'd
let me dress one game next season.

982
01:22:38,951 --> 01:22:40,215
Look, Rudy...

983
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,889
...the NCAA really hamstrings us
with this 60 rule.

984
01:22:44,924 --> 01:22:47,323
In some positions
we only have one backup.

985
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:51,733
You know every year we're competing
for the nationaI championship.

986
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:58,770
Is this just for your father?

987
01:22:58,805 --> 01:23:03,578
No, it's for everybody who told me
that it would be impossible.

988
01:23:03,613 --> 01:23:05,345
It's for my brothers...

989
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,353
...the kids in my high schooI,
the guys I work with at the mill.

990
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:13,328
They can't come to practice
and see that I am part of the team.

991
01:23:18,329 --> 01:23:20,533
Okay.

992
01:23:22,534 --> 01:23:28,107
You deserve it. You'll dress
for one game next season.

993
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:33,213
Thank you, coach.

994
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,180
Yes!

995
01:23:35,215 --> 01:23:40,121
I don't know which game yet,
but it'll definitely be next season.

996
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:43,490
I'm sure.

997
01:23:43,525 --> 01:23:46,795
I guess they'll tell me
a few days before the game.

998
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:51,968
Look, just be ready, okay?

999
01:23:52,003 --> 01:23:54,056
Thanks, Dad.

1000
01:23:54,091 --> 01:23:56,108
All right, bye.

1001
01:23:57,308 --> 01:23:58,776
V- I-C-T-O-R-Y

1002
01:23:58,811 --> 01:24:00,210
V- I-C-T-O-R-Y

1003
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:04,617
Victort, victort, that's our crt

1004
01:24:04,652 --> 01:24:07,852
Gipper. Hey, Gipper!

1005
01:24:07,887 --> 01:24:11,025
Goddamn Miami law schooI beckons.

1006
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:13,225
Miami!

1007
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:17,264
I had to go.

1008
01:24:17,299 --> 01:24:22,805
What's wrong with you?

1009
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,110
Look.

1010
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:29,344
Ara quit?

1011
01:24:29,379 --> 01:24:32,382
I'll be goddamned.
Who's the new coach?

1012
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:36,252
- Dan Devine from the Green Bay Packers.
- Wow...

1013
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:41,527
I'm sure Ara's gonna let him know
about his promise to let you dress.

1014
01:24:41,562 --> 01:24:46,066
Come on, let's take a walk.

1015
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:47,499
When are you leaving?

1016
01:24:47,535 --> 01:24:49,735
- In about six minutes.
- Really?

1017
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:54,176
The spring semester starts
in two weeks.

1018
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:56,977
We've had a hell of a goddamn-

1019
01:24:57,012 --> 01:24:59,716
We've had a hell of a goddamn run,
haven't we?

1020
01:24:59,751 --> 01:25:01,916
Yeah, we have.

1021
01:25:01,951 --> 01:25:06,974
You let me know when you dress.
I'll fly out for that.

1022
01:25:07,009 --> 01:25:11,997
There's no way I can thank you
for everything you've done.

1023
01:25:12,032 --> 01:25:15,900
You already have.

1024
01:25:15,935 --> 01:25:18,803
You remember Elza, right?

1025
01:25:18,838 --> 01:25:20,572
- Hi.
- Good to see you again.

1026
01:25:20,607 --> 01:25:23,443
She's my girI now.
She's coming with me.

1027
01:25:23,478 --> 01:25:26,245
- Isn't that goddamn something?
- Dennis.

1028
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:31,553
I forgot. I'm not allowed
to say "goddamn" no more.

1029
01:25:31,588 --> 01:25:35,141
What's a lapsed Catholic to do?

1030
01:25:35,176 --> 01:25:39,121
- We should get going.
- Yeah.

1031
01:25:39,156 --> 01:25:43,067
I'll see you next fall, right?

1032
01:25:43,102 --> 01:25:45,807
Thanks for everything.

1033
01:25:49,808 --> 01:25:52,012
- You take care of him.
- We're going.

1034
01:26:59,825 --> 01:27:02,726
Don't I know you?

1035
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:04,840
Ruettiger, get your ass back out here!

1036
01:28:44,314 --> 01:28:46,724
Sorry, man.

1037
01:28:52,725 --> 01:28:54,696
Rudy, sorry man.

1038
01:28:57,397 --> 01:28:59,065
It just ain't right.

1039
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,137
No, it's not.

1040
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:04,937
- Where are you going?
- I quit.

1041
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:07,641
- Wait up.
- The hell with Devine, with Yonto!

1042
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:11,146
Wait up. In two years,
you haven't missed one practice.

1043
01:29:11,181 --> 01:29:12,780
And now you just quit?

1044
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:15,618
- That's what I said.
- I don't want you to quit.

1045
01:29:15,653 --> 01:29:18,654
What the hell is it to you?

1046
01:29:18,689 --> 01:29:24,262
You're one of the reasons
I stayed on this last year.

1047
01:29:24,297 --> 01:29:25,881
Well, I'm sorry.

1048
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:27,430
You're sorry?

1049
01:29:27,465 --> 01:29:29,300
You're full of crap!

1050
01:29:29,335 --> 01:29:31,307
Everything you did and
everything you said is bullshit!

1051
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:40,222
We'll check with the weather service
by 5, and we'll make a decision then.

1052
01:29:48,223 --> 01:29:50,325
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1053
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:54,130
What you doing here?
Don't you have practice?

1054
01:29:54,165 --> 01:29:57,800
Not anymore. I quit.

1055
01:29:57,835 --> 01:30:02,441
Well, since when are you
the quitting kind?

1056
01:30:02,476 --> 01:30:04,911
I don't see the point anymore.

1057
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:07,312
So you didn't make the dress list.

1058
01:30:07,347 --> 01:30:09,747
There are greater tragedies
in the world.

1059
01:30:09,782 --> 01:30:13,520
I wanted to run out of
that tunneI for my dad.

1060
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:14,722
To prove to everyone-

1061
01:30:14,757 --> 01:30:17,991
Prove what?

1062
01:30:18,026 --> 01:30:22,865
- That I was somebody.
- Oh, you are so full of crap.

1063
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:26,767
You're 5 feet nothing.
A hundred and nothing.

1064
01:30:26,803 --> 01:30:29,604
And you've got hardly
a speck of athletic ability.

1065
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:34,412
You hung in with the best college
football team in the land for 2 years!

1066
01:30:34,447 --> 01:30:39,249
And you're gonna walk out of here
with a degree from Notre Dame.

1067
01:30:39,284 --> 01:30:43,890
In this life you don't have to prove
nothing to nobody except yourself.

1068
01:30:43,925 --> 01:30:48,496
And after what you've gone through,
if you haven't done that by now...

1069
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:51,802
...it ain't gonna never happen.

1070
01:30:54,803 --> 01:30:57,541
Now go on back.

1071
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:04,648
I'm sorry I never got you
to see your first game.

1072
01:31:04,683 --> 01:31:09,218
Hell, I've seen too many games
in this stadium.

1073
01:31:09,253 --> 01:31:14,058
- You said you never saw a game.
- I've never seen one from the stands.

1074
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:17,461
You were a player?

1075
01:31:17,496 --> 01:31:21,266
I rode the bench for two years.

1076
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:24,904
Thought I wasn't being played
because of my color.

1077
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:28,509
I got filled up with
a lot of attitude, so I quit.

1078
01:31:28,544 --> 01:31:31,344
Still not a week goes by,
I don't regret it.

1079
01:31:31,379 --> 01:31:35,417
And I guarantee a week won't go by,
you won't regret walking out...

1080
01:31:35,452 --> 01:31:41,624
...letting them get the best of you.

1081
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:46,564
Now, you hear me clear enough?

1082
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:48,394
Yeah.

1083
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:21,239
Bill? The pitch was too soon.
Wait. Make him commit.

1084
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:23,708
38 option, 38 option.

1085
01:32:23,743 --> 01:32:25,589
Hustle up.

1086
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:39,557
It's Rudy.

1087
01:33:09,563 --> 01:33:13,198
Welcome back. Line up.

1088
01:33:13,233 --> 01:33:16,380
What's going on down there?
Get back to work.

1089
01:33:26,182 --> 01:33:31,654
Yeah?

1090
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:37,727
Oh, hi, Roland. Come in.

1091
01:33:37,762 --> 01:33:40,666
I want Rudy to dress in my place.

1092
01:33:40,701 --> 01:33:43,572
He deserves it.

1093
01:33:46,073 --> 01:33:48,473
Don't be ridiculous.

1094
01:33:48,508 --> 01:33:53,121
Georgia Tech's one of the top
offensive teams in the country.

1095
01:34:00,122 --> 01:34:04,794
You're an all-American
and our captain. Act like it.

1096
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:08,007
I believe I am.

1097
01:34:16,108 --> 01:34:18,241
Me too, coach.

1098
01:34:18,276 --> 01:34:20,951
I want Rudy to dress in my place.

1099
01:34:24,752 --> 01:34:26,957
Coach, this is for Rudy.

1100
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:32,018
This is for Rudy, coach.

1101
01:34:57,023 --> 01:34:59,858
I promise. This is the real thing.

1102
01:34:59,893 --> 01:35:06,132
I'm gonna be on
the sidelines, in uniform.

1103
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:10,138
Frank, I've never asked you
for anything in my life.

1104
01:35:10,173 --> 01:35:18,248
Promise me he'll be
on that bus tomorrow.

1105
01:35:18,283 --> 01:35:27,592
Frank, I want you to be there too.

1106
01:35:27,627 --> 01:35:29,703
Please.

1107
01:36:10,710 --> 01:36:11,877
Here you go.

1108
01:36:11,912 --> 01:36:14,148
What a day for a game, huh?

1109
01:36:14,183 --> 01:36:16,482
You bet.

1110
01:36:16,517 --> 01:36:18,918
All right. Go Irish!

1111
01:36:18,953 --> 01:36:21,955
- Go Irish! Thank you.
- Thank you.

1112
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,995
I'll get you on the way back.
I don't got my wallet.

1113
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,567
This is our gate.

1114
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:34,403
Hey, Rudy?

1115
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:39,545
I just want you to know that
I think this is a great thing.

1116
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,512
Thanks.

1117
01:36:41,547 --> 01:36:42,783
You're welcome.

1118
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,868
It's your day.

1119
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:33,657
- I wish you could be out there with me.
- I know.

1120
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:54,734
This is the most beautifuI sight
these eyes have ever seen.

1121
01:37:54,769 --> 01:37:56,707
Come on, Dad.

1122
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:07,513
Huddle up.

1123
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:13,289
Bring it in, guys.

1124
01:38:13,324 --> 01:38:15,290
Father.

1125
01:38:15,325 --> 01:38:19,160
Everyone, take a hand.

1126
01:38:19,195 --> 01:38:21,530
HaiI Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1127
01:38:21,565 --> 01:38:25,703
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1128
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:28,807
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now...

1129
01:38:28,842 --> 01:38:30,542
...and at the hour of our death.

1130
01:38:30,577 --> 01:38:31,844
Notre Dame, Our Mother.

1131
01:38:31,879 --> 01:38:33,721
Pray for us!

1132
01:38:41,722 --> 01:38:45,193
You all know what you have to do.

1133
01:38:45,228 --> 01:38:46,712
Remember...

1134
01:38:46,747 --> 01:38:48,162
...no one...

1135
01:38:48,197 --> 01:38:52,633
...and I mean no one...

1136
01:38:52,668 --> 01:38:58,576
...comes into our house
and pushes us around.

1137
01:38:58,611 --> 01:39:02,512
This is your game now, gentlemen.

1138
01:39:02,547 --> 01:39:06,704
And for you seniors, it's your
last one, so make it count...

1139
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:10,862
...because you'll remember it
for the rest of your lives.

1140
01:39:15,463 --> 01:39:17,510
Let's get 'em.

1141
01:40:02,518 --> 01:40:09,225
Rudy!

1142
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,960
You ready, champ?

1143
01:40:10,995 --> 01:40:13,664
I've been ready
for this my whole life.

1144
01:40:13,699 --> 01:40:16,779
Then you take us out on the field.

1145
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:30,466
All right, let's go.

1146
01:40:44,468 --> 01:40:46,509
Here they go!

1147
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:54,120
- That's him. 45.
-45. You see him?

1148
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:03,823
Forty-five! Forty-five!

1149
01:41:03,858 --> 01:41:05,635
That's him! I know him!
That's Rudy!

1150
01:41:14,637 --> 01:41:16,370
You guys already know this...

1151
01:41:16,405 --> 01:41:19,409
...but this is the most important
game of your lives!

1152
01:41:19,444 --> 01:41:22,077
No excuses! Do the work!

1153
01:41:22,112 --> 01:41:24,993
- Our Lady of Victory!
- Pray for us!

1154
01:41:34,995 --> 01:41:37,612
What the hell?
They're across the line.

1155
01:41:52,615 --> 01:41:55,907
Watch number 70.
He's waltzing with him.

1156
01:42:17,912 --> 01:42:20,168
Forty yards for
a Notre Dame touchdown.

1157
01:43:14,178 --> 01:43:18,651
It's the fourth quarter with 3 minutes
to play and the issue still in doubt.

1158
01:43:18,686 --> 01:43:23,590
As Barratt fades back to pass for
Georgia Tech from his 30-yard line.

1159
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:25,423
Looks upfield, throws.

1160
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:27,860
Intercepted by Roland Steele!

1161
01:43:27,895 --> 01:43:30,363
He has a convoy of blockers
down the sidelines.

1162
01:43:30,398 --> 01:43:35,404
Steele going in unmolested
for a Notre Dame touchdown.

1163
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,842
It's a backbreaker for Georgia Tech.

1164
01:43:39,877 --> 01:43:42,645
Joe, play all the seniors!

1165
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,513
And Rudy?

1166
01:43:44,548 --> 01:43:49,486
- Let him in for one play.
- Absolutely not.

1167
01:43:49,521 --> 01:43:52,863
Coach, you gotta play him.
Come on, coach. One play.

1168
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:01,133
Give him a chance, coach!

1169
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:04,711
Notre Dame all over the ball.
Thompson recovers for the Irish.

1170
01:44:39,213 --> 01:44:43,385
37 seconds remaining and it'll be
all over here at Notre Dame.

1171
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:44,751
To our left...

1172
01:44:44,786 --> 01:44:48,256
...I'm picking up a chant
from the Notre Dame student body.

1173
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:50,891
Can't quite make out just what it is.

1174
01:44:50,926 --> 01:44:56,133
Devine's gonna empty his bench with
a little time remaining in the game.

1175
01:44:56,168 --> 01:45:00,002
One of the players going
into the game is Jamie O'Hare.

1176
01:45:00,037 --> 01:45:04,910
O'Hare was heavily recruited throughout
the countrt several years ago.

1177
01:45:04,945 --> 01:45:07,144
He came to Notre Dame...

1178
01:45:07,179 --> 01:45:11,157
...and it's safe to say that
his career has been a disappointment.

1179
01:45:18,959 --> 01:45:20,969
They're chanting for Rudy.

1180
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:30,147
Tell him to go to a knee.

1181
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:40,118
Listen up.
Victory formation.

1182
01:45:40,153 --> 01:45:41,818
The hell with Devine.

1183
01:45:41,853 --> 01:45:44,021
If the offense is here,
Rudy can't play.

1184
01:45:44,056 --> 01:45:47,276
- We gotta run the play.
- No, we gotta score now.

1185
01:45:47,311 --> 01:45:50,497
- Let's get a score for Rudy.
- It's the last game!

1186
01:45:50,532 --> 01:45:53,568
All right, this one's yours.
Pro right.

1187
01:45:53,603 --> 01:45:56,603
38 halfback pass on one.
On one. Ready?

1188
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:30,363
What the hell is he doing?

1189
01:46:49,367 --> 01:46:53,074
Touchdown. Notre Dame, 23.
Georgia Tech, 3.

1190
01:46:56,074 --> 01:47:00,278
That was for you.

1191
01:47:00,313 --> 01:47:02,949
What was that?
Who called that play?

1192
01:47:02,985 --> 01:47:04,683
It's just occurred to me...

1193
01:47:04,718 --> 01:47:08,590
...what they've been chanting
for the last few minutes.

1194
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:11,491
It's the name "Rudy. "

1195
01:47:11,526 --> 01:47:15,662
Dan Ruettiger, a walk-on senior...

1196
01:47:15,697 --> 01:47:21,972
...subject of an article in yesterday's
student newspaper, The Observer.

1197
01:47:22,007 --> 01:47:24,922
All right, go get 'em, kid!

1198
01:47:37,424 --> 01:47:39,472
He's so little!

1199
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:54,380
Come on. One more play.

1200
01:47:57,381 --> 01:47:59,949
What do I do?

1201
01:47:59,984 --> 01:48:01,732
Stay in. Stay there!

1202
01:49:21,747 --> 01:49:24,661
Who's the wild man now?!

1203
01:49:34,663 --> 01:49:36,396
That's it.

1204
01:49:36,431 --> 01:49:38,129
You won.
