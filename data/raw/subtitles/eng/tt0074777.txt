2
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:37,118
I'll be waiting for you there...

3
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:39,421
in about one hour.

4
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:48,630
You can trust me.

5
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,673
<i>Ah, signora.</i>

6
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,375
<i>Grazie.</i>

7
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,057
<i>Che cosa?</i>

8
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,877
Go on. Go on!

9
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,456
The end is too gory.

10
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,757
Cut out one roll of the table.

11
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:38,747
Okay.

12
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,026
The signal was much too obvious.

13
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,628
It kills the surprise.
Make it shorter.

14
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:42,652
Okay, Monroe.

15
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:43,886
What else?

16
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,049
You wanted to see the beach
scene from<i> Dark Moonlight.</i>

17
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,105
Right.

18
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,640
Okay, Jack.

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,759
No, no, don't go to
him at all, stay on her.

20
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,995
You don't need him. Stay on her

21
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,669
all the way down to
the edge of the sea.

22
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,437
She's the one
we're interested in.

23
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,757
Remember that scene
from<i> Reaching for the Moon,</i>

24
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:10,996
when Bebe Daniels ran out
of the house, down to the lake?

25
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,914
This is where we shot it.

26
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,600
No, of course you
wouldn't remember,

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,935
you're too young.

28
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,881
I've been here
since the silent days.

29
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,183
I knew them all.

30
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,384
Did you know the Keystone Kops?

31
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,374
All of them!

32
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,870
What a bunch of guys.

33
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,195
Shh.

34
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,404
This was Minna
Davis' dressing room.

35
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:43,678
She was taken ill
for the last time...

36
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:45,547
in this room.

37
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,519
That's her.

38
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,404
She was beautiful.

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,806
She was a great friend of mine.

40
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,742
I remember we had
to call her husband.

41
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:01,296
I called him myself.

42
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,166
I remember that call well.

43
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:08,436
I said, "Mr. Stahr...

44
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,622
I'm afraid your wife
has been taken ill."

45
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,525
He said, "I'll be right over."

46
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,812
And this is where
it all happened.

47
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,133
This is where Mr. Stahr
was when I called him.

48
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,103
The administration building.

49
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,749
That's where he still is.

50
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,985
That's his office up there.

51
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,576
Oh...

52
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,807
Gee, it's so big!

53
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,675
It's big, all right.

54
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,683
They don't have anything
bigger in the whole world.

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,397
How did they do the
earthquake in<i> San Francisco?</i>

56
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,520
The earthquake?

57
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,257
Well, there are various ways
you can do an earthquake.

58
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,560
What you can do first
is rock the camera.

59
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,544
You see?

60
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,231
Or if you're in a room,
you can rock the set.

61
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,067
I mean, you can rock the room.

62
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,946
Then you throw
in a lot of dust...

63
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,490
No, I wasn't asleep.

64
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,959
When are you coming home?

65
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:04,960
Mmm.

66
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,461
Oh, I'm all right.

67
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,463
I miss you, that's all.

68
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,510
Oh, she's with her grandmother.

69
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:11,867
She's fine.

70
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:13,502
She has a new tooth.

71
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,503
Mmm.

72
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,505
How did it go?

73
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,650
Oh, that's good.

74
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,640
Mmm...

75
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,235
When are you coming home?

76
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,195
Oh... good.

77
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,431
Beautiful baby.

78
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,843
And you want me to meet you?

79
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,301
Mmm.

80
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,282
Next time I'll be
coming with you.

81
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,582
Come on, come on.

82
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,742
They owe me a little
time off at the club anyway.

83
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,777
Oh...

84
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,980
Couldn't be more boring
than being without you.

85
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,549
Yes, me too.

86
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,184
Bye, darling.

87
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,465
Want me to go?

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,632
Yes!

89
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,141
No.

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,646
Cut!

91
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:15,630
Kill the arc.

92
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:16,843
That's a print.

93
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:17,877
That was really good.

94
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,868
I mean, very good.

95
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,147
Give me a finder.

96
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:23,338
All right, take it up.

97
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,573
Your aspirin, sir.

98
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,672
Strike the sofa!

99
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,446
Pick up the phone, Harry.

100
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,715
Pull the phone back, Fred.

101
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,283
And watch that cable!

102
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,773
Makeup!

103
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,320
That was really
very good indeed.

104
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,309
Makeup!

105
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,355
You think so?

106
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,845
It was absolutely terrific.

107
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,262
It was really wonderful.

108
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,458
It was shit.

109
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,896
Here we go again, Billy.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,952
Listen, Didi,

111
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,154
I have to tell you
it was exquisite.

112
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,434
It was fake.

113
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,191
It was false.

114
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,643
Didn't you notice?!

115
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,217
I want to do it again.

116
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,153
You'll never do it better.

117
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,572
I know I can play that scene.

118
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,603
I want to do it again.

119
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,642
It was good for me.

120
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,976
What?

121
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,346
Didi...

122
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,297
trust me.

123
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,243
Thank you.

124
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm ready.

125
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,770
Chief?

126
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,972
Let's do it again.

127
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,353
We're going to do it again.

128
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,342
Bitch.

129
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,522
Get it quiet now, damn it!

130
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,790
All right, bring it down.

131
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,346
Quiet! Quiet, damn it!

132
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,623
Good night, Frank.

133
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,624
Good night, Brian.

134
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,258
Yo.

135
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,082
Harry, I'm waiting!

136
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,468
Good night, boys.

137
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,202
Good night. See
you tomorrow, Hank.

138
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,918
Goodnight. Bye.
See you tomorrow.

139
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,846
<i>I love him.</i>

140
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,298
He's a genius.

141
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,414
I've always wanted
him to get every credit.

142
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:37,605
But what about me?

143
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,419
New York has forgotten me.

144
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,409
No, no...

145
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,760
New York has forgotten me.

146
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,229
You want to know why?

147
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,830
Because I'm too generous.

148
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,831
It's my nature.

149
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,484
I make life too easy for them.

150
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,386
You know what I am?

151
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:56,892
I am the strong base upon
which Monroe Stahr rests.

152
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,259
I'm loyal to him,

153
00:07:58,295 --> 00:07:59,444
and I'm loyal to New York.

154
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,412
New York knows you're loyal...

155
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,959
and New York
respects you for it.

156
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,577
Well, New York
should be loyal, too.

157
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:05,984
New York is loyal.

158
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,968
To who?

159
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,086
To you.

160
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,022
All I want is recognition.

161
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,668
You've got it.

162
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,991
I want to see it.

163
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,620
I want to see it right
here on this desk.

164
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,228
I want to feel it.

165
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,464
Just cut it out, would you?

166
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:25,882
You see that bastard
touch my daughter?

167
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:26,871
Who is he?

168
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,524
Some goddamn writer.

169
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,260
You know, I went down to the
writers' building this morning.

170
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:35,692
I stood there and watched
them for 15 minutes.

171
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,833
There were two of them
there didn't write a line.

172
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:39,913
You can go right in.

173
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:40,969
Thanks.

174
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,211
Hi.

175
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,650
Are you an actress?

176
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,685
No, I'm just Daddy's
little daughter.

177
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,798
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:58,822 --> 00:08:59,787
What are you?

179
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,740
Oh, I'm just a lawyer

180
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,124
from New York.

181
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,059
She's too intelligent
to be an actress.

182
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,795
She's graduating from
Bennington next June,

183
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,796
with honors.

184
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:10,112
I love actors, though.

185
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:11,911
I don't need all this.

186
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh, sure you do.

187
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,802
What's the matter,
don't you feel well?

188
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,792
I don't feel so good.

189
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,867
You want some bicarbonate?

190
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,928
I feel so shaky.

191
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,241
Here.

192
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,294
What were you
doing with that writer?

193
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,495
He's all right.

194
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,014
Don't get too close to writers.

195
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,126
Jesus Christ!

196
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,683
Cecilia, are you all right?

197
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,588
Stahr!

198
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,848
Brady!

199
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:17,949
Brady!

200
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:25,923
Hello?

201
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:26,924
Yeah?

202
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,925
Are you all right?

203
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,926
What happened?

204
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,073
Geez, yeah.

205
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,280
We had an earthquake.

206
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:34,116
Monroe, pick up
the phone, will you?

207
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:39,187
Yeah.

208
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah, I'll be right down.

209
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,807
Robbie!

210
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,229
Yeah!

211
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,230
It's split!

212
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,276
It's split all the way down...

213
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,265
Help with that spot!

214
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,867
Go on!

215
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,014
Is that where it's coming from?

216
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,048
Yeah, that's it.

217
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,283
Look at the water tower.

218
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,550
Get a light on it.

219
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,152
Get a light on that pipe break!

220
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,743
Where's the valve, Robbie?

221
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,223
You know where the valve is?

222
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:25,200
Robbie, they're
shooting on 17 and 24.

223
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,701
See the gates are shut tight.

224
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,202
French village is flooded, too.

225
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,476
We'll get the pumps from
the tanks on stage nine.

226
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:35,538
Okay.

227
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,805
Robbie, we need more men.

228
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,795
Oh, Christ,

229
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,111
we need that head next week.

230
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,565
Bring in the pumps
from stage nine!

231
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:46,822
Stage nine.

232
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,294
Watch those cables!

233
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,962
Get the cables out of the water!

234
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,939
Whoa...

235
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,015
All right, hold it, right...

236
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,327
Whoa.

237
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,346
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,000
We just followed the trucks in.

239
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,330
Good evening, sir.

240
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,953
Good evening, Kino.

241
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,240
Is everything all
right at the studio, sir?

242
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,896
Yes.

243
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,972
Would you like some tea?

244
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,239
No, thank you.

245
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,158
Shall I turn off the lights?

246
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,043
Yes.

247
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,606
Darling, I've come home.

248
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,975
Yes.

249
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,109
Yes.

250
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,162
I told you, one of
them wore a silver belt.

251
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,560
How dare you ask
me that question?

252
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,937
No, I don't know
which one wore it.

253
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,004
Right.

254
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,451
Cut!

255
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,974
Well, find a cop on duty.

256
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,075
Mm-hmm.

257
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,478
And tell Robinson to call
me as soon as he wakes up.

258
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,726
Which one, Monroe?

259
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,450
Take six.

260
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,251
No, wait, let's see it again.

261
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,997
Roll it again, Jack.

262
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,003
Stage 24,

263
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,116
take five.

264
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,523
Action!

265
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:41,045
Yeah?

266
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,580
You found the name?

267
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,183
Oh, good work, good work.

268
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,803
Uh-huh.

269
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,483
Well, no, divide the
name between yourselves

270
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:52,668
and try every one in the book.

271
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,658
Okay?

272
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:54,693
Good work.

273
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,729
Hi.

274
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,311
Will you go to the ball
with me tomorrow night?

275
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,301
What ball?

276
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,303
Screenwriters' Ball...

277
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,405
down at the Ambassador.

278
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Oh, yeah.

279
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,475
No, I don't think so.

280
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,808
I might just come in late.

281
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:11,876
Oh?

282
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,286
So...

283
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,540
Uh...

284
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,793
So, when do you
go back to college?

285
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,393
I've just got home.

286
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,130
You get the whole summer off.

287
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,549
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,746
I'll go back as soon as I can.

289
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,619
Well, don't you want to?

290
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,624
Well, I don't know.

291
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,828
I'm pretty well educated.

292
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,307
Maybe I should get married.

293
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,630
Well, I'd marry you.

294
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,299
I'm lonely, but...

295
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,179
I'm too old and tired
to undertake anything.

296
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,752
Undertake me.

297
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,154
What?

298
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,664
Undertake me.

299
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,949
Oh, no, Cecilia.

300
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,502
I've known you so long.

301
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,316
I've never thought
of you that way.

302
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,508
You don't use
that line this year.

303
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,477
What?

304
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,523
Nothing.

305
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,350
Yeah?

306
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,462
Mr. Stahr, Mr. Rodriguez

307
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,686
is still waiting to see you.

308
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,686
Oh, yeah. Send him in.

309
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,687
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,688
These actors...

311
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,351
Did you press that
buzzer with your foot?

312
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,976
Yes.

313
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,011
Of course not.

314
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:39,087
But you will dance
with me at the ball.

315
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:40,815
Sure I will.

316
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:43,702
Hello, Monroe.

317
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,737
Hello!

318
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:46,738
How are you?

319
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,273
Wonderful, really great.

320
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,352
You look just wonderful.

321
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,376
Thank you.

322
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:55,346
I had to see you in your office.

323
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,415
Sit down.

324
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:07,475
So... what's the trouble?

325
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,542
I'm through.

326
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,311
You're through?

327
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:11,691
What do you mean,
you're through?

328
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:12,697
Have you seen<i> Variety?</i>

329
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,811
Your picture's held
over at the Roxy.

330
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,835
It did 37,000 in
Chicago last week.

331
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,871
I know.

332
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:23,291
That's a tragedy.

333
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,293
I'm in a tragic mess.

334
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,329
It's...

335
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Well, what are
you talking about?

336
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,070
It's Esther and me.

337
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:37,238
Mm-hmm?

338
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,273
I love her.

339
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,273
She's my wife.

340
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,275
Yeah?

341
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,909
But I'm through.

342
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,411
I'm washed up.

343
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,581
It's gone.

344
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:49,717
What's gone?

345
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:50,918
I've gone.

346
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:55,957
I'm ashamed to go
to bed with my wife.

347
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,881
I know<i> Rainy Day</i> grossed
25,000 in Des Moines

348
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,095
and broke all
records in St. Louis

349
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,381
and did 27,000 in Kansas City?

350
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,487
Kansas City.

351
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,666
But here I am,

352
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,885
afraid to go to bed
with my own wife,

353
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,677
the woman I love.

354
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,945
So I came to you, Monroe.

355
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:20,948
I've been to a doctor.

356
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,335
I've been to a cathouse.

357
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,903
Ah.

358
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,672
Yeah... nothing.

359
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,240
Nothing.

360
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,242
So, I... so I came to you.

361
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,831
Yes, you did, I see.

362
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:55,584
Ah...

363
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:04,303
I mean, we both came from
nowhere, from nothing, right?

364
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,293
Right.

365
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:07,006
What were you, a messenger boy?

366
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,995
That's right.

367
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:09,464
I delivered groceries.

368
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,465
Yeah.

369
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,933
This is America.

370
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,968
Look where we are now.

371
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:17,305
I mean, look at this
office, look at you.

372
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Yeah.

373
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,754
We both came from nothing.

374
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,789
That's why I can talk to you.

375
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:24,879
I understand.

376
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,133
So, how is Esther?

377
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,701
She's the greatest
girl in the world.

378
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:30,702
She's my wife.

379
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,770
Well, I know that.

380
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,016
I mean, she loves me.

381
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,172
Oh, I know, I know.

382
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,840
500 girls marched up to my house

383
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:36,975
from the high school.

384
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,477
I stood behind the
curtains and I watched them.

385
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,478
I couldn't go out.

386
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,814
I mean, if they knew...

387
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,894
If my family knew...

388
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,228
I watch myself on the screen

389
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,869
and I want to puke!

390
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,403
Mm.

391
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:53,753
Look at me.

392
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,120
All right, I'm a big star,

393
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:57,022
but what's really
profound about me

394
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,341
is that I'm a big star
with a big fan club

395
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,143
Yeah, I-I know. who
actually loves his wife,

396
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,346
so why would anyone want to
play these lousy tricks on me?

397
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,335
You see what I mean?

398
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,471
Sure, sure.

399
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,140
So I came to you.

400
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,594
Yeah.

401
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,360
Oh, yes, I see.

402
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,807
Just play the part
the way I said.

403
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:31,796
All right then.

404
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:32,797
Thanks, Monroe.

405
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,913
Thanks.

406
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,234
The doctor's here.

407
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,518
Ah.

408
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Hi, Doc.

409
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,274
Come on in.

410
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,709
When are you going
to take that vacation?

411
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:03,444
Soon.

412
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,679
When?

413
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,681
Oh, sometime in
five or six weeks.

414
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:11,719
Getting any sleep?

415
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:13,421
About five hours.

416
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:16,101
Do you need any more pills?

417
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,542
No, I'm fine.

418
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,496
Any... pain?

419
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,566
Some.

420
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,214
They'll never get
writers unionized.

421
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,971
You know why?

422
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:31,972
Hello, Monroe.

423
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:32,973
Gentlemen.

424
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:33,974
Monroe.

425
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,010
Gentlemen.

426
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:39,892
Everything all right?

427
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,916
Fine.

428
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,646
I was just saying

429
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,648
they'll never get
the writers unionized.

430
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:46,638
You know why?

431
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,818
Because they hate
each other's guts.

432
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,419
They'd sell each
other out for a nickel.

433
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,587
This man from New York
seems pretty set on doing it...

434
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,056
The one who's
coming out to see me.

435
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,046
What's his name?

436
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,297
Brimmer.

437
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,484
Brimmer.

438
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,387
Communist, yeah.

439
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,721
You mean a real Communist?

440
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,573
Yeah, sure, a real one.

441
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:06,802
I mean,

442
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,337
some of these
guys are just jokers

443
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,861
that call themselves Communists.

444
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,807
And mostly they
are fairies, too.

445
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,832
There are other
aspects, of course.

446
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,166
Well...

447
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,979
I'll find out next week.

448
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,970
Better find out.

449
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,923
The last thing we
need is a writers' strike.

450
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,125
We got 16 pictures
going into production.

451
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,327
I'll handle him.

452
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,545
Monroe can handle him.

453
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,300
Anyway, mostly they are fairies.

454
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,353
There are other
aspects, of course.

455
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:39,907
Monroe, tell me, what
do you think of the idea

456
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,983
to make<i> Manon</i> with
a happy ending, huh?

457
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,007
It's been making money
without a happy ending

458
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,213
for a century and a half.

459
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,824
What about the South
American picture?

460
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:52,471
We're going ahead with that.

461
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,621
With the same budget?

462
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:59,160
It's out of proportion.

463
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,155
With that budget,
we have no chance.

464
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,755
What do you think, Mr. Marcus?

465
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,138
Monroe is our production genius.

466
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,240
I count upon him

467
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:15,220
and lean heavily upon him.

468
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:20,781
The balance sheet last year
showed a $27 million profit.

469
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,817
It's all due to him.

470
00:23:27,357 --> 00:23:29,301
You know who first told
him you were a genius?

471
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,826
Guess.

472
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:32,827
You.

473
00:23:32,862 --> 00:23:34,795
Right.

474
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,891
Damn good of you, Pat.

475
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,915
No, no.

476
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,549
I admire a man, I say so.

477
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,518
I want the whole world to know.

478
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,570
Perhaps that's
because I'm Irish.

479
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:44,522
The Irish are a very
warm-hearted people.

480
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,139
The Greeks are warm, too.

481
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,786
I mean, try to find me
a Greek Communist.

482
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,987
You couldn't find one.

483
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,390
But there's not a $2 million
gross in the country right now.

484
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:53,425
Don't forget, we're in the
middle of a depression.

485
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:54,432
I know that.

486
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,168
I think we can count on
a million and a quarter

487
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,285
from the road show,

488
00:23:58,321 --> 00:23:59,920
perhaps a million and a half,

489
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:01,800
and a quarter of
a million abroad.

490
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:05,425
But you have a budget
of a million, seven-five-o,

491
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:08,062
and you say you expect
less than that in grosses?

492
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,958
What about prints
and advertising?

493
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,949
Distribution costs.

494
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,151
Interest on the money...
and some profits.

495
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,219
Yes, he's here.

496
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,294
I'm not even sure
we'll gross a million.

497
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,618
It's for you, Mr. Stahr.

498
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,069
Thank you.

499
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,059
Yes.

500
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,374
Hello, Robin.

501
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,064
Uh-huh.

502
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,732
Good.

503
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,479
Yes, leave the number
with Miss Doolin.

504
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:31,503
I'll call later.

505
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,488
You know, I'm
fairly new out here.

506
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:37,652
Do I understand you to
say that you expect to gross

507
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,411
a half a million
short of your budget?

508
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,146
It's a quality picture.

509
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:43,381
"Quality picture."

510
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,143
What the hell are we...?

511
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,219
We've played safe
for two years now.

512
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,666
It's time we made a picture
that isn't meant to make money.

513
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,834
Pat Brady is always
saying at Academy dinners

514
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,870
that we have a certain
duty to the public.

515
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:55,993
Okay.

516
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,839
It's a good thing
for the company

517
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,164
to slip in a picture
that'll lose money...

518
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,799
Write it off as good will.

519
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:04,203
Gentlemen.

520
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,076
Thank you.

521
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,117
Boy.

522
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,302
Mr. Stahr!

523
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,416
Hey, that's a good
spiral you got there.

524
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,406
Hello, Monroe. Hi, Dan.

525
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,407
Sir. Yes, Wylie.

526
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,408
Hello, Mr. Stahr.

527
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,409
You going somewhere?

528
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,410
Stage four.

529
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,645
Listen, have you read my script?

530
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:32,858
Uh, yes, I have.

531
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:35,215
Well, what do you think of it?

532
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,962
I think it's an
interesting script.

533
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:38,251
Uh-huh.

534
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,271
How come you have
two other writers on it?

535
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,254
Take it away! Who told you that?

536
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,423
They're friends of mine.

537
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,957
They didn't know I was doing it.

538
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:45,559
I didn't know
they were doing it.

539
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:46,860
We all found out this morning.

540
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,607
I'm sorry. What can you do?

541
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,613
That's the system.

542
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,597
We're back!

543
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,744
You invented that system.

544
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:52,878
You've distorted the girl.

545
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:55,180
By distorting the girl,
you've distorted the story.

546
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:57,404
We're back.

547
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,572
How?

548
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,574
How have I distorted
the damn girl?

549
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,521
I'm not interested
in your fantasies.

550
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,111
Eddie.

551
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,112
Eddie!

552
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,113
Hello, Monroe.

553
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,114
Hi.

554
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,693
Listen, two people
at the sneak preview

555
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:11,096
complained that Morgan's fly
was open for half the picture.

556
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,253
What?

557
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:13,999
Oh, it's probably just a couple
of seconds, but I want you

558
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:15,501
to run the picture until
you find the footage.

559
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,068
Have some people with
you. Someone will spot it.

560
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,058
Sure, I'll take care of it.

561
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:19,059
Okay.

562
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:20,327
Hi, Cooke.

563
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:21,656
You've given her a secret life.

564
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,975
She doesn't have a secret life.

565
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,276
You've made her a melancholic.

566
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,310
She's not a melancholic.

567
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,300
Mr. Stahr.

568
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,301
How do you know?

569
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,446
Because I paid 50,000
bucks for that book,

570
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,614
and because that's
the way I see it.

571
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:31,471
Mr. Stahr. Thank you.

572
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,874
If I want to do a Eugene
O'Neill play, I'll buy one.

573
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,878
The girl stands for
health, vitality, love.

574
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,064
You've made her a whore.

575
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:44,413
Now, you can work with
Beth and Charlie on this,

576
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,915
or I'll take you
off the subject.

577
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,004
It's up to you.

578
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,652
So how do you want the girl?

579
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,709
Perfect.

580
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,011
Mm-hmm.

581
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,349
Gee.

582
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,438
And I always have admired you.

583
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,296
Were you wearing a
silver belt last night?

584
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:14,432
Yes, I was.

585
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:19,903
I'm glad we got you.

586
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:21,850
We didn't have much to go on.

587
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:25,009
Oh, really?

588
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,311
Who are you?

589
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:29,847
My name is Monroe Stahr.

590
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,282
I'd like to see you.

591
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,984
There's a reason.

592
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,885
What reason?

593
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,384
Well, I'd like to talk to
you for a few minutes.

594
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,574
To put me in the movies?

595
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,310
No, that wasn't my idea.

596
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,311
When?

597
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:45,512
Tonight.

598
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:46,713
Where?

599
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,248
At your house?

600
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:49,616
No.

601
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:51,985
Somewhere outside.

602
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,488
I'll meet you somewhere at 9:00.

603
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,923
I'm afraid that's impossible.

604
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,193
Oh.

605
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:00,561
Uh...

606
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,262
What about tomorrow?

607
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:03,341
No, no, no.

608
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:05,299
Okay, tonight, 9:00.

609
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:08,668
On the corner of
Webster and Park?

610
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:10,388
Okay.

611
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,756
Should I wear the silver belt?

612
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,924
Yes.

613
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:20,380
Hello, Monroe.

614
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,493
How's it going?

615
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:23,534
Geez, I'm glad you came down.

616
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,947
She's too old for me.

617
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,326
See who it is.

618
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,276
Hello.

619
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,964
Oh, get these
photographers away from me!

620
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,533
May I?

621
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,797
No, let's go.

622
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,927
These publicity men.

623
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:50,928
How are you?

624
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,562
I've got the damn curse,

625
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,743
and I'm having
all these troubles

626
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,266
with my frigging hair.

627
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,801
Well, don't worry about it.

628
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:58,847
It's like seaweed.

629
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,648
They're using the wrong shampoo.

630
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,718
They're trying to screw
me, these bitches.

631
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:03,707
On my word of...

632
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,544
We're using her
favorite shampoo!

633
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,247
Oh, darling, forgive me.

634
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:17,087
Nobody likes me, or something.

635
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,589
I love you, Didi.

636
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,328
How do you think I look?

637
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,648
How do you think I
look on the screen?

638
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,594
You're going to be beautiful.

639
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:31,635
You're a great actress.

640
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:37,675
Isn't she a terrible bitch?

641
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,376
You can't handle her.

642
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:43,380
We'll have to call it off, Red.

643
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,648
The picture?

644
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:45,783
No.

645
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,452
I'm putting Daditch on it.

646
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,020
Oh.

647
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,066
We'll try some other time.

648
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,619
Shall I finish this scene?

649
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:57,394
It's being done now.
Daditch is in there.

650
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,862
Well, what the hell is he...?

651
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,442
He went in when we came out.

652
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,747
He read the script last night.

653
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:08,271
Listen, you haven't touched

654
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,307
what she's able to do.

655
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,012
How about my coat?

656
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,747
I left it on the set.

657
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,808
Here it is.

658
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,980
Okay, that's it.

659
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:37,017
Yes?

660
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,986
It's Mr. Brady.

661
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:43,290
Yeah.

662
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:44,291
Monroe,

663
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:46,588
we've just had a call
from New York... urgent.

664
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:47,789
Do you have a minute?

665
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,679
No, it'll have to
wait till morning.

666
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:50,931
We can come in to you.

667
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:52,966
All I need is... Not now.

668
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,583
Hi.

669
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,021
Where are we going?

670
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,336
I don't know.

671
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,760
What about a hotel?

672
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,740
No, I'll run you home.
Where do you live?

673
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,730
Run me home?

674
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:41,910
Mm-hmm.

675
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,300
It's no hurry.

676
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,486
What's the matter?

677
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,641
Don't you like me?

678
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:53,877
I thought you liked me.

679
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,613
I've been stupid.

680
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,014
Last night I had an idea

681
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,061
you were the exact
double of someone I knew.

682
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,605
It was dark, and the
light was in my eyes.

683
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,276
Really? Mm-hmm.

684
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,291
That's funny.

685
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,628
Which way?

686
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:12,830
Westwood.

687
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,035
I'm an actress.

688
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,737
Hmm.

689
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,673
I'm going to be an actress.

690
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,875
Mm-hmm.

691
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:31,932
Listen, could you stop here

692
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,500
a minute, please?

693
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,579
You said the end of the street.

694
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,036
Yes, but I'd like to stop here

695
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:37,237
a minute,<i> please.</i>

696
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:42,170
Could you wait a second?

697
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,986
Kathleen?

698
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,421
Edna?

699
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:05,999
See him? There he is.

700
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,477
Who is he?

701
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,650
I think it was you

702
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:24,651
he wanted to see.

703
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:26,520
He telephoned me.

704
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,533
I'm afraid we were
rude at the studio.

705
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,835
Oh...

706
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,337
We had no business there.

707
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:47,106
Well, I hope you'll both
come and make a real tour...

708
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:48,308
Of the studio.

709
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,560
Who are you?

710
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:54,476
He's a producer.

711
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,234
He got us mixed up.

712
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,069
Phone me, will you?

713
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,273
Good night, Mr. Stahr.

714
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,942
Oh, good night.

715
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:13,399
You're Irish.

716
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,647
I've lived in
London a long time.

717
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:19,256
I didn't think you could tell.

718
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,291
Oh, yes.

719
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,088
You've lived in London?

720
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:36,956
Yes.

721
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:44,064
I came out here
a few months ago.

722
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,955
Was it me you wanted
to see, or Edna?

723
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,956
Uh...

724
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,524
I made a silly mistake.

725
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,242
I thought you were
wearing the silver belt.

726
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:58,946
Oh.

727
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:00,058
But I wasn't.

728
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:02,532
No, but it was you
who I wanted to see.

729
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,301
Yes?

730
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,253
Why?

731
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:07,754
You reminded me of someone.

732
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,038
So you're Mr. Stahr,
the producer?

733
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:14,328
Mm-hmm.

734
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,374
I suppose the girls
are all after you

735
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:18,810
to put them on the screen.

736
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:21,368
They've given up.

737
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:23,348
You didn't want to
put me in the pictures?

738
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,420
No.

739
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,322
Good.

740
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,794
I feel as if I had
my foot in the door.

741
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,863
Like a collector.

742
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,765
I'm sorry, I can't ask you in.

743
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,342
Well...

744
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:51,715
Is this all?

745
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,319
Well, I do hope
we'll meet again.

746
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,057
I'd be sorry if we didn't.

747
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,466
Good evening, sir.

748
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,524
Good evening.

749
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,060
Will you be running
a movie tonight?

750
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,398
No.

751
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,239
Shall I turn off the lights?

752
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,540
Yes.

753
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,990
Sit down, Mr. Boxley.

754
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:15,648
Why?

755
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,684
You've stuck me with two hacks.

756
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:20,987
They can't write.

757
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,721
And they... bugger up

758
00:37:22,756 --> 00:37:24,390
everything I write.

759
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,170
Well, why don't you
just write it yourself?

760
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:27,704
I have. I sent you some.

761
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:29,389
That was just talk.
We'd lose the audience.

762
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,547
Talk?

763
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,565
Mm-hmm.

764
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,535
I don't think you
people read things.

765
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,536
The men...

766
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:39,005
The men are dueling...

767
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,906
when this conversation
takes place.

768
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:43,025
At the end, one of
them falls into a well

769
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,661
and has to be hauled up...

770
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,429
in a bucket.

771
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,812
Would you write that
in a book of your own?

772
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,387
Of course I wouldn't.

773
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:58,223
I inherited this
absurd situation.

774
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,954
Let me ask you,

775
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,794
do you ever go to the movies?

776
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,096
Rarely.

777
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:05,743
Because people
are always dueling

778
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:06,894
and falling down wells?

779
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:07,995
And talking a load of rubbish!

780
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,969
Listen...

781
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:11,348
has your office
got a stove in it

782
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,383
that lights with a match?

783
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,557
I think so.

784
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,525
Suppose you're in your office.

785
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,327
You've been
fighting duels all day.

786
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,394
You're exhausted.

787
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,616
This is you.

788
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,303
A girl comes in.

789
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,089
She doesn't see you.

790
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,427
She takes off her gloves.

791
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,264
She opens her purse.

792
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,499
She dumps it out on the table.

793
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,802
You watch her.

794
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,606
This is you.

795
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,377
Now...

796
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:13,616
She has two dimes, a
matchbox and a nickel.

797
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,354
She leaves the
nickel on the table.

798
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,457
She puts the two dimes
back into her purse.

799
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,760
She takes the
gloves... They're black.

800
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,531
Puts them into the stove.

801
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,816
Lights a match.

802
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:34,286
Suddenly, the telephone rings.

803
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,127
She picks it up.

804
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:44,262
She listens.

805
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,149
She says:

806
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,518
"I've never owned a pair
of black gloves in my life."

807
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,053
Hangs up.

808
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,204
Kneels by the stove.

809
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,455
Lights another match.

810
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,474
Suddenly,

811
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,759
you notice...

812
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,514
there's another
man in the room...

813
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,321
watching every
move the girl makes.

814
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,722
What happens?

815
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:44,840
I don't know.

816
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,742
I was just making pictures.

817
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,444
What was the nickel for?

818
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:52,080
Jane, what was the nickel for?

819
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,817
The nickel was for the movies.

820
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,693
What do you pay me for?

821
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,712
I don't understand
the damn stuff.

822
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:09,765
Yes, you do...

823
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,134
or you wouldn't have
asked about the nickel.

824
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,296
Well, Monroe's right.

825
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:25,631
Lights.

826
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,666
Needs about 20
minutes out of it.

827
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:30,903
Twice it just lays
there and goes to sleep.

828
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:33,105
Well, I've got to go to
that damn writers' ball.

829
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,174
I'll talk to you
tomorrow, Eddie.

830
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:38,077
What's Eddie, asleep?

831
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:39,078
Jesus.

832
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:40,095
Goddamn movie

833
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,496
even puts the editor to sleep.

834
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,919
He's not asleep,

835
00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:47,569
Mr. Brady.

836
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,960
What do you mean,
he's not asleep?

837
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,025
He's dead, Mr. Brady.

838
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:56,045
Dead?!

839
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,041
What do you mean, he's dead?

840
00:41:58,065 --> 00:41:59,031
He-he must have
died during the...

841
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:00,032
How can he be dead?

842
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,067
We were just
watching the rough cut!

843
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:05,181
Jesus, I didn't... I
didn't hear anything.

844
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:06,483
Did you hear anything?

845
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:07,606
Not a thing.

846
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,808
Eddie...

847
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,326
he probably didn't want

848
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,697
to disturb the
screening, Mr. Brady.

849
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,330
Good evening, Mr. Stahr.

850
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:11,663
What are you doing here?

851
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:14,967
I'm with Martha Dodd's party.

852
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,270
What's your name?

853
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:19,905
Kathleen Moore.

854
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:24,009
Kathleen Moore.

855
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,278
Hmm.

856
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:27,846
How do you know her?

857
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,315
Oh.

858
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:34,820
I met her...

859
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:36,788
recently.

860
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,476
Are you married?

861
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,210
No.

862
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:45,881
I must go back now.

863
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,750
I promised this dance.

864
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:54,757
Can we have lunch or dinner?

865
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,759
No.

866
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,364
It's impossible.

867
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,401
I must go back.

868
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,796
Thank you for the dance.

869
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:21,533
Monroe?

870
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:22,534
Monroe?

871
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:23,535
Hi, Rod.

872
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,670
Hello, Esther.

873
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:25,737
Hello, Monroe.

874
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:27,472
Monroe, come here.

875
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:28,473
Isn't she wonderful?

876
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:29,858
Isn't she beautiful?

877
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,593
Stop.

878
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,639
How are you, Esther?

879
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,040
Great. Really great.

880
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,676
This is the greatest
country in the world...

881
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,310
Everybody stands a
chance in this country.

882
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:38,779
There's not going
to be no revolution.

883
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:40,931
The only people who want a
revolution are the Communists.

884
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:42,288
And the fairies.

885
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,634
What kind of a revolution

886
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:44,984
do the fairies want?
A Communist one.

887
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,592
What else?

888
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:49,272
Do you think Stalin
likes homosexuals?

889
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:50,262
Homosexuals, eh?

890
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:51,475
Let me tell you something.

891
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,010
You know, "homo"
is a Greek word.

892
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:54,878
I come from Europe. I'm Greek.

893
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:56,868
That's why he knows
so much about Stalin.

894
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:58,382
But Stalin ain't Greek.

895
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:00,233
You're damn right he ain't.

896
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,223
He's a fairy.

897
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,802
He's a bastard, Communist,

898
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,421
Russian fairy...
That's what he is!

899
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:05,445
Calm down.

900
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:07,379
Fleishacker,

901
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:08,630
let me tell you something.

902
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,633
After the revolution,

903
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:11,616
you'll be the only safe one.

904
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:12,685
You know why?

905
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,286
Because they always need lawyers

906
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:15,287
after a revolution

907
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:16,671
to straighten out the legal end.

908
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,209
What do you think, Monroe?

909
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,178
I think so, too.

910
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,152
You know, uh...

911
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,054
I saw<i> Highway to Tomorrow.</i>

912
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,223
You're right.

913
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,459
You take 20 minutes out of it,

914
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,726
you got a fine movie.

915
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:38,743
Possibly.

916
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,228
The shape's not too bad.

917
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,497
The shape is good.

918
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,915
You know why?

919
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,849
Because Eddie is
one of the best cutters

920
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,619
in the business.

921
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:10,209
Where are you going?

922
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,210
It's early.

923
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,911
It's late.

924
00:47:13,814 --> 00:47:15,391
They talked as if
I'd been dancing

925
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,626
with the Prince of Wales.

926
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,616
Meet me tomorrow.

927
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:18,617
Mr. Stahr?

928
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:19,963
I've said I can't.
Isn't that enough?

929
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:21,564
Not now. Can I talk
to you for one minute?

930
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,733
Look, tomorrow is Sunday.

931
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,334
Why don't you
come to the studio.

932
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:25,435
I'll show you around the studio.

933
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:26,770
No, I wouldn't like
to see the studio.

934
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:27,760
You wouldn't?

935
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:28,761
Monroe, we have that...

936
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:29,762
Excuse me.

937
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:33,157
I say, Mr. Stahr...

938
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,733
Look.

939
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,049
Look, where would
you like to go?

940
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:43,508
I'm a weak woman.

941
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,820
If I meet you tomorrow...

942
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:57,095
will you leave me in peace?

943
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,700
No, you won't, will you?

944
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:09,901
So I'll say no...

945
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:11,217
and thank you.

946
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:13,955
Going down.

947
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:16,908
Oh!

948
00:48:18,279 --> 00:48:20,557
What does it take to
get you to leave a party?

949
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:22,575
You're the one who
wanted to come.

950
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,877
I only agreed to come

951
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,344
because you said we
wouldn't stay so long.

952
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:27,688
Not in the elevator.

953
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:33,806
Main floor.

954
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,217
They looked so
strange when I came in,

955
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,568
as if they were furious at me

956
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:45,020
for not being somebody famous.

957
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,004
I know another way out.

958
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:49,359
Back up, back up,
let them through.

959
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,694
How old are you?

960
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,807
I've lost track.

961
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,980
About 35, I think.

962
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,715
Where are you from?

963
00:48:57,751 --> 00:48:59,362
I was born on the
East Side of New York.

964
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:01,420
They said at the table
you were the "boy wonder."

965
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,465
Ah...

966
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:04,589
Where's your car?

967
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:11,096
Listen, where will
we meet tomorrow?

968
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:13,432
I'll come by and I'll
pick you up at 2:00.

969
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:14,467
Hmm?

970
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:16,502
No...

971
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,969
No.

972
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:38,290
I'll meet you here,
the same spot.

973
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:56,519
Have you been here all night?

974
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,509
Yes.

975
00:49:58,545 --> 00:49:59,555
I'd like some tea,

976
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,547
if it's a place
you're not known.

977
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,382
There's a place on the coast

978
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,494
where they have a trained seal;

979
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:07,219
he knows me pretty well.

980
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,653
He bit me once.

981
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:09,688
But he won't say a word

982
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:10,956
unless you're rude to him.

983
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:13,558
What are you hiding?

984
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:17,112
Nothing.

985
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,141
What'll you have?

986
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,130
Two teas.

987
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,166
Right.

988
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,272
Shake?

989
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,161
See?

990
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,196
He remembers you.

991
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,765
This seal has the
memory of an elephant.

992
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,033
He likes<i> him...</i>

993
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,452
'cause he's such a charming guy.

994
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:18,774
He responds to fish.

995
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,575
This seal's got taste.

996
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:21,576
Come on out.

997
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,561
Seat.

998
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:24,279
How long have you known him?

999
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,281
Oh, I've known him

1000
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:27,033
for years.

1001
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:29,134
His father's an
old friend of mine.

1002
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,603
But the family
history ain't too good.

1003
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:33,638
His mother ran off
with another seal.

1004
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,158
Is he good to you?

1005
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,113
Well, he's good to
me on the whole.

1006
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,340
Only got one problem.

1007
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,414
He won't ride in the backseat.

1008
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:43,849
That's right...

1009
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:46,151
Climbs over the
back and rides in front.

1010
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,087
Now, I know he's
a good driver...

1011
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:51,924
But who owns the car?

1012
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:52,925
Right?

1013
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Right!

1014
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:56,862
Here.

1015
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:58,630
Give him this.

1016
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:00,282
Whoa. Thanks.

1017
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,157
Well, this is it.

1018
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:41,407
I don't know why
I'm building it.

1019
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:43,409
Maybe it's for you.

1020
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:44,754
Well, I think it's great of you

1021
00:52:44,778 --> 00:52:45,923
to build a big house for me

1022
00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:48,387
without even knowing
what I look like.

1023
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,091
I didn't know what kind
of a roof you wanted.

1024
00:52:58,159 --> 00:52:59,525
I don't need a roof.

1025
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:05,181
What's that for?

1026
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,415
The projector.

1027
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,416
The what?

1028
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,585
The movie projector.

1029
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,840
I gave a luncheon
out here last week,

1030
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,731
so I had some props
and grass brought out

1031
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,599
to see how the place felt.

1032
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,634
Is that real grass?

1033
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,635
Sure.

1034
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:28,781
Is it from a film set?

1035
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,206
No.

1036
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,318
Can I walk on it?

1037
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:33,109
Walk.

1038
00:53:33,144 --> 00:53:34,977
I'll watch you.

1039
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:13,698
Will you live here alone?

1040
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,014
Yes.

1041
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,780
Alone with your movie projector?

1042
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:19,338
Mm-hmm.

1043
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:20,616
Where do you live now?

1044
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,773
I live in my old house.

1045
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,915
What's this?

1046
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,583
Oh, the, uh, swimming pool.

1047
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:34,252
Or it will be a swimming pool.

1048
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:37,734
Well, you need a constant
supply of Nereids to...

1049
00:54:37,758 --> 00:54:39,357
plunge and gambol.

1050
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:40,393
Nereids, what's that?

1051
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,512
Sea nymphs.

1052
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:47,677
Oh, no.

1053
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,413
I'll just come out
here to read scripts.

1054
00:54:49,437 --> 00:54:51,103
No distractions.

1055
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,480
I lived with a man
for a long time.

1056
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,282
Too long.

1057
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:05,317
I wanted to leave,

1058
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:08,520
but he couldn't let me go.

1059
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,689
So finally I ran away.

1060
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:17,880
I must go now.

1061
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,515
I have an appointment;
I didn't tell you.

1062
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:23,024
That's not true,
but it's all right.

1063
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,142
Thank you, I must go now.

1064
00:55:32,012 --> 00:55:33,545
We'll do it again?

1065
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,725
No, I'm sorry,

1066
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,082
I'll... write you a letter.

1067
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:40,352
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1068
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,822
Do you ever go to the movies?

1069
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:03,992
Oh.

1070
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,028
Not much.

1071
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,528
Why not?

1072
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:07,840
Should I?

1073
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,132
Millions of people do.

1074
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,277
Why?

1075
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,268
Because movies are
necessary to them.

1076
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,653
They give them what they need.

1077
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,657
What you need.

1078
00:56:19,927 --> 00:56:21,026
It's my life.

1079
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:46,184
Have you got them?

1080
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,287
Yes.

1081
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,633
<i>This</i> wasn't my idea.

1082
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,428
Let's go back.

1083
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,664
To your house on the beach.

1084
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,478
Watch your head.

1085
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,960
Comfortable?

1086
01:01:49,422 --> 01:01:51,889
I wonder when it's settled.

1087
01:01:51,924 --> 01:01:53,158
What?

1088
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:57,762
I mean, there's a
moment when you needn't,

1089
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,497
and then there's another moment

1090
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:01,666
when you know that
nothing in the world

1091
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:03,901
can keep it from happening.

1092
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:05,337
Hmm.

1093
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,751
I know why you
liked me at first.

1094
01:02:19,786 --> 01:02:20,819
Edna told me.

1095
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:22,487
What did she tell you?

1096
01:02:22,522 --> 01:02:24,589
That I look like Minna Davis.

1097
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:28,026
Hmm.

1098
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,196
You were happy with her?

1099
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:34,732
I don't remember.

1100
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:37,285
You don't remember?

1101
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,486
No.

1102
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:44,687
I remember what she looked like,

1103
01:02:44,711 --> 01:02:47,712
but I don't remember
what we were like.

1104
01:02:57,457 --> 01:02:59,601
She became very professional.

1105
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,921
She was very, very successful.

1106
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,146
She answered
all her fan letters.

1107
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,251
Everyone loved her.

1108
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:21,312
I was closest to her
when she was dying.

1109
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,610
I'm warm now.

1110
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,308
Does the maid live here or
just come for your breakfast?

1111
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:20,372
There'd be a lots for a maid
to do, looking after Mr. Stahr.

1112
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:37,636
Are you going to
stay in California?

1113
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:42,281
Are you?

1114
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:47,999
Huh?

1115
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,421
Can't you tell me?

1116
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,694
What's the mystery?

1117
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,729
Not now.

1118
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:02,864
It's not worth telling.

1119
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:07,580
Come here then.

1120
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:08,636
You're tired.

1121
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:09,637
No, I'm not.

1122
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,739
I mean, you work too hard.

1123
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,274
Don't be a mother.

1124
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,143
What shall I be?

1125
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:17,845
I'll show you.

1126
01:05:23,537 --> 01:05:24,936
You've taken off my apron.

1127
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:35,647
It's here I look
like Minna Davis...

1128
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:36,730
isn't it?

1129
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:40,501
No.

1130
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,792
It's here.

1131
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:56,762
What was he like?

1132
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,453
He was a very learned man.

1133
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:03,807
He could have taught
all sorts of subjects.

1134
01:06:03,843 --> 01:06:06,977
He taught me.

1135
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:09,313
We traveled.

1136
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,602
He was very attractive.

1137
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:18,873
And he was also...

1138
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,125
well, he was a king.

1139
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,494
I mean, he really
was a real one,

1140
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,097
but he was out of a job.

1141
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:28,999
That's what he used to say.

1142
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:37,075
I went everywhere with him.

1143
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,710
I belonged to him.

1144
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:43,631
We were too close.

1145
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:49,087
We should probably have had
children to stand between us.

1146
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:55,093
He wasn't really
much like a king,

1147
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:57,162
not nearly as much as you,

1148
01:06:57,197 --> 01:07:00,081
but then none of them were.

1149
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:06,448
Then he started to drink.

1150
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:09,874
He tried to force me to
sleep with all his friends.

1151
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:16,580
And I...

1152
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,207
I want a quiet life.

1153
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,611
I can't stop looking at you.

1154
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,201
I don't want to lose you.

1155
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:41,589
I want a quiet life.

1156
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,608
Have you lost something?

1157
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:23,831
It might have fallen out.

1158
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,066
What?

1159
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,067
An envelope.

1160
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,468
Is it important?

1161
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,269
No, it doesn't matter.

1162
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,166
I'll call you?

1163
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:45,403
I haven't got a phone.

1164
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:52,877
What's your real address?

1165
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:56,848
It's just Bel Air,
there's no number.

1166
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:57,982
Bel Air.

1167
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:11,095
Well, Mr. Stahr, good night.

1168
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:13,097
"Mr. Stahr"?

1169
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:19,571
Stahr.

1170
01:09:19,606 --> 01:09:21,439
Is that better?

1171
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,140
If you like.

1172
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,600
This fell out of the car.

1173
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,090
Oh, thank you.

1174
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,526
Did any of these people
want to speak to me urgently?

1175
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,638
All of them.

1176
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:00,662
Oh, yes?

1177
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,199
Would you get me
a glass of water?

1178
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:06,395
Yes, sir.

1179
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:37,192
Thank you.

1180
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:38,182
Yes, sir.

1181
01:10:38,217 --> 01:10:41,786
Make sure you
wake me up at 11:30.

1182
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:42,887
Yes, sir.

1183
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:28,960
"In half an hour, I
will be seeing you.

1184
01:12:28,995 --> 01:12:32,397
"When we say good-bye,
I will hand you this letter.

1185
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:35,133
"It is to tell you that I
am to be married soon,

1186
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:39,170
"and that I won't be able
to see you after today.

1187
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:41,050
"I should have
told you last night,

1188
01:12:41,074 --> 01:12:42,952
"but it didn't seem
to concern you,

1189
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:46,144
"and it would seem silly to
spend this beautiful afternoon

1190
01:12:46,179 --> 01:12:49,981
"telling you about it and
watching your interest fade.

1191
01:12:50,016 --> 01:12:52,550
"Let it fade all at once, now.

1192
01:12:54,288 --> 01:13:00,158
"I am very flattered that anyone
who sees so many lovely women...

1193
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:02,027
"I can't finish the sentence,

1194
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:05,813
"and I'll be late if I don't go
to meet you straight away.

1195
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:10,017
With all good wishes,
Kathleen Moore."

1196
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,481
<i>George!</i>

1197
01:13:14,207 --> 01:13:16,508
Come on!

1198
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,509
Open up!

1199
01:13:17,544 --> 01:13:19,177
You're all mad!

1200
01:13:20,514 --> 01:13:23,181
I know that.

1201
01:13:23,216 --> 01:13:24,516
But why don't you open up?

1202
01:13:24,551 --> 01:13:26,651
Because you're...
you're all mad.

1203
01:13:26,687 --> 01:13:28,453
Let's get you out of there.

1204
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,088
We'll go and have a drink.

1205
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:33,374
I don't drink in the
middle of the day.

1206
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,376
Hello, Mr. Stahr.

1207
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:35,411
Mr. Stahr.

1208
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:40,381
Cheers.

1209
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,922
Hello, Mr. Boxley.

1210
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:52,009
What's the trouble?

1211
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:58,600
I am... dangerous...
when I'm drunk.

1212
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,469
Watch your step.

1213
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,098
I heard you were
writing a script.

1214
01:14:03,122 --> 01:14:05,039
Mmm.

1215
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,307
That's right.

1216
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:13,464
Here it is.

1217
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,469
And, uh...

1218
01:14:18,504 --> 01:14:20,121
here's the nickel.

1219
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:22,440
It's...

1220
01:14:22,475 --> 01:14:24,659
for the movies.

1221
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:28,326
Get him home.

1222
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:30,982
Stahr!

1223
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:33,017
Stahr, I want
copyright protection

1224
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:35,453
for the scene I just wrote

1225
01:14:35,488 --> 01:14:38,356
about a drunken
writer and a producer!

1226
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:40,758
Stahr!

1227
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,098
Oh, Mr. Stahr.

1228
01:14:54,774 --> 01:14:55,874
Hello.

1229
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,243
What's the matter?

1230
01:14:58,278 --> 01:15:01,345
Nothing. Drunks. How are you?

1231
01:15:01,381 --> 01:15:03,281
I have a terrible grudge.

1232
01:15:03,316 --> 01:15:04,426
What's that?

1233
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,800
You forgot to dance
with me at the ball.

1234
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,736
The ball.

1235
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:10,454
Oh, God.

1236
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:13,241
One moment you were there and
the next moment you were gone

1237
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:14,387
and you never came back.

1238
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,493
I'm sorry.

1239
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:18,696
I just... stepped
out for some air

1240
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:20,765
and then I met a man...

1241
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,534
A man I hadn't seen for years.

1242
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,583
Then we went for a drive.

1243
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:28,684
I hadn't realized

1244
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:31,208
how that part of
Hollywood had changed.

1245
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,864
You can see it
very clearly at night.

1246
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,235
Mm.

1247
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,219
Then it was late,

1248
01:15:42,255 --> 01:15:43,532
you know, so I went home to bed.

1249
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:47,425
So that part of Hollywood
has changed, has it?

1250
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,859
Yeah, unrecognizable.

1251
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,729
What about the man?

1252
01:15:51,765 --> 01:15:52,846
What about him?

1253
01:15:54,034 --> 01:15:56,601
Did he think that part of
Hollywood had changed?

1254
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,002
Yes, he thought so, too.

1255
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:04,825
Well, that must have
been a real nice drive...

1256
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:08,930
Both of you just driving
around, thinking the same thing.

1257
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:11,632
Yeah.

1258
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,370
Listen, I want

1259
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,017
to ask you a question.

1260
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,057
What is it?

1261
01:16:19,092 --> 01:16:21,275
Had the man changed?

1262
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,977
No.

1263
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,032
He was exactly the same.

1264
01:16:30,202 --> 01:16:32,052
Old Gus.

1265
01:16:38,311 --> 01:16:39,643
Cecilia.

1266
01:16:50,457 --> 01:16:52,189
Your father's in conference.

1267
01:16:52,225 --> 01:16:54,625
Your father is in a conference.

1268
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,046
Hi, honey.

1269
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:03,729
God, it's like a
steam room in here.

1270
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:05,647
Why don't you open
up some windows?

1271
01:17:05,671 --> 01:17:07,205
I am.

1272
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,275
I don't know how
you can stand it.

1273
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,459
Hey, are you all right?

1274
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:12,534
Your shirt is soaked.

1275
01:17:12,562 --> 01:17:13,761
I'm fine, honey.

1276
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:14,762
Just fine.

1277
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:16,242
I'm just bothered, that's all.

1278
01:17:16,266 --> 01:17:17,431
What is it?

1279
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,966
Oh, it's Monroe Stahr,

1280
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:21,080
that goddamn Vine Street Jesus.

1281
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:23,015
He's in my hair day and night.

1282
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:24,288
Oh?

1283
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:25,840
What are you talking about?

1284
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:28,637
Oh, he sits there like a
goddamn priest or rabbi,

1285
01:17:28,661 --> 01:17:29,855
telling me what
he's going to do,

1286
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,557
what he's not going to do.

1287
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:32,824
He's got me half crazy.

1288
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,316
Look, um, why don't
you go on outside, honey.

1289
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,711
I got some thinking to do.

1290
01:17:38,355 --> 01:17:39,654
You're coming with me.

1291
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:41,456
You're going to wash your face

1292
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,023
and put on a clean shirt

1293
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:45,292
and come and do
your thinking outside.

1294
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,527
It's beautiful out.

1295
01:17:47,981 --> 01:17:50,865
Do you know how
long it's been since...

1296
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,234
we had lunch together?

1297
01:17:58,558 --> 01:17:59,740
Have you been drinking?

1298
01:18:04,363 --> 01:18:06,814
Okay, honey, I'll come with you.

1299
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:09,011
You go on ahead
and get some air,

1300
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:11,275
and I'll be with
you in a minute.

1301
01:18:19,813 --> 01:18:22,224
You go out and
get some air, honey!

1302
01:18:22,248 --> 01:18:24,593
I'll be with you
in just a minute!

1303
01:18:55,615 --> 01:18:57,348
Cover her up.

1304
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:50,968
Can I buy you a drink?

1305
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,439
I don't usually, uh,
drink with the talent.

1306
01:19:55,474 --> 01:19:59,160
I don't usually
drink with the boss.

1307
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:03,948
One before you go.

1308
01:20:03,983 --> 01:20:05,666
I'll get it.

1309
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,416
Bourbon.

1310
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:24,802
One cube of ice.

1311
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,095
You're quite a girl, Lucienne.

1312
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:37,598
Yes, everybody likes Lucienne.

1313
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:43,570

I thought you were
coming away with me.

1321
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:37,675
I can't.

1322
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,179
You know I can't.

1323
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,251
I owe it to him.

1324
01:21:49,422 --> 01:21:51,388
I must go to him.

1325
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:57,348
Don't you owe me something, too?

1326
01:21:58,731 --> 01:22:00,164

1332
01:22:41,507 --> 01:22:42,584
Remember me to your husband.

1333
01:22:42,608 --> 01:22:43,785
Tell him he'll never know you

1334
01:22:43,809 --> 01:22:45,392
the way I know you.

1335
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:50,998
I lied.

1336
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:53,600
I will forget you.

1337
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:56,604
I'll forget you by tonight.

1338
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:21,395
Makeup and hair here?

1339
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,774
Yes, Mr. Stahr. Yes, Mr. Stahr.

1340
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:24,276
You made her look like an angel.

1341
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,677
I don't know how you've done it.

1342
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,001
Congratulations.

1343
01:23:27,036 --> 01:23:29,070
Thank you, Mr. Stahr.
Thank you, Mr. Stahr.

1344
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:36,443
Those, uh, French girls,

1345
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,513
they really, uh,
they've really got depth.

1346
01:23:39,549 --> 01:23:41,793
They really know
what it's all about.

1347
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:44,818
Yes, I think they have depth.

1348
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:46,821
Who wrote that scene?

1349
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:48,121
The English writer, Monroe.

1350
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,608
Boxley.

1351
01:23:50,643 --> 01:23:53,511
It's the last thing he wrote
before... before he left.

1352
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:55,190
What a great going-away present.

1353
01:23:55,214 --> 01:23:57,292
Who ever heard
anyone say, "Nor I you."

1354
01:23:57,316 --> 01:23:59,528
Has anyone ever said,
"Nor I you," to you?

1355
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:00,851
"Nor I you."

1356
01:24:00,886 --> 01:24:02,081
Hmm.

1357
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,105
"Nor I you."

1358
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,601
We'll have to rewrite
the scene and reshoot it.

1359
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:06,590
It's absolute crap.

1360
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:07,826
People don't speak like that.

1361
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,321
Do I have any
writers around here

1362
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:11,540
who understand
the way people talk?

1363
01:24:11,564 --> 01:24:12,846
Norman.

1364
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:14,031
Yes, Monroe.

1365
01:24:14,066 --> 01:24:15,427
Put four writers on
that scene tonight,

1366
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:17,296
and I want to see the
rewrites before they shoot it.

1367
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,186
Sure, Monroe.

1368
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,432
How much is it going to
cost to reshoot the scene?

1369
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:22,406
Well, the set's
already been struck.

1370
01:24:22,442 --> 01:24:24,274
So how much is it going to cost?

1371
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:26,359
Oh, about $50,000.

1372
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:27,639
And we have a preview next week.

1373
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:28,757
I don't care what it costs.

1374
01:24:28,781 --> 01:24:29,781
Make it.

1375
01:24:35,555 --> 01:24:38,035
I don't know what's
wrong with the scene.

1376
01:24:38,858 --> 01:24:41,178
I thought that was a
pretty touching scene.

1377
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:11,155
Do you know a Miss
Kathleen Moore?

1378
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,489
What do you mean?

1379
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,236
A Miss Kathleen
Moore is on the line.

1380
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,759
She said you asked her to call.

1381
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,049
Hello.

1382
01:25:59,221 --> 01:26:00,221
Who is he?

1383
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:02,773
He's an American.

1384
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:04,558
He took me away.

1385
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,727
He brought me here.

1386
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:09,146
I live in his house.

1387
01:26:09,181 --> 01:26:10,631
Where is he?

1388
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,200
He's away.

1389
01:26:13,235 --> 01:26:15,002
He's an engineer.

1390
01:26:15,037 --> 01:26:17,554
He'll be back...

1391
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,923
next week.

1392
01:26:22,694 --> 01:26:23,994
We're getting married.

1393
01:26:54,993 --> 01:26:56,359
Are you in love with him?

1394
01:26:56,394 --> 01:26:58,227
Oh, yes.

1395
01:26:58,263 --> 01:27:01,698
It's all arranged.

1396
01:27:01,733 --> 01:27:03,583
He saved my life.

1397
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:15,628
I just wanted to
see you once more.

1398
01:27:20,552 --> 01:27:22,986
It's all arranged.

1399
01:27:25,757 --> 01:27:27,290
Stop walking.

1400
01:27:34,132 --> 01:27:36,399
Come back.

1401
01:27:50,883 --> 01:27:52,883
Closer.

1402
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,075
Open your cape.

1403
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:15,989
Close your eyes.

1404
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:40,451
I can never get used to the way

1405
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:43,843
night falls here so fast.

1406
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:49,916
There's no twilight, is there?

1407
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:52,985
Not really, no.

1408
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,289
It's so sudden.

1409
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:11,054
I suppose some
parts of America are...

1410
01:30:11,089 --> 01:30:12,188
gentle.

1411
01:30:12,224 --> 01:30:15,558
Are you leaving California?

1412
01:30:15,593 --> 01:30:17,027
We might.

1413
01:30:17,062 --> 01:30:18,361
I might.

1414
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,287
Listen.

1415
01:30:34,212 --> 01:30:36,212
What?

1416
01:30:45,307 --> 01:30:46,587
Nothing.

1417
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,027
Can you drop me
here at this corner?

1418
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:15,919
Good-bye.

1419
01:31:28,867 --> 01:31:29,832
Is Mr. Stahr...

1420
01:31:29,868 --> 01:31:31,311
She just flew in from New York.

1421
01:31:31,335 --> 01:31:33,497
Well, Christ, she's a
very important actress!

1422
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,533
I'm sorry, there's
nothing I can do about it.

1423
01:31:35,557 --> 01:31:36,789
We have an appointment!

1424
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,625
I'm sorry, there's
nothing I can...

1425
01:31:51,156 --> 01:31:52,455
Mr. Robinson, please...

1426
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:54,068
We've got to get this
set approved by 2:00.

1427
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,025
Otherwise, we're way behind.

1428
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,026
I understand,

1429
01:31:57,062 --> 01:31:58,505
but there's nothing I
can do for you today.

1430
01:31:58,529 --> 01:31:59,529
Now, please go.

1431
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:13,137
You have to make arrangements
for the preview on Friday.

1432
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:16,996
He's escorting me.

1433
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:18,998
I'll do it.

1434
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:44,523
We have to make
arrangements for the preview.

1435
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:48,294
What time shall I pick you up?

1436
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:51,780
Don't say you're not
going... because you must go.

1437
01:32:52,951 --> 01:32:55,635
You're the head of the studio.

1438
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,387
You've no alternative.

1439
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,207
What time shall I pick you up?

1440
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,611
Any time.

1441
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,901
I'll be here at 7:00.

1442
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,633
Okay.

1443
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:34,123
They're waiting for
you, Mr. Rodriguez.

1444
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:35,925
They're waiting
for you on the mike.

1445
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,059
Excuse me!

1446
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:38,305
Didi!

1447
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:40,780
Didi, this is Mr. Fleishacker.

1448
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:42,031
How do you do?

1449
01:33:42,066 --> 01:33:43,483
Mrs. Fleishacker.

1450
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:44,484
Yeah.

1451
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:46,151
Excuse me.

1452
01:33:47,672 --> 01:33:48,938
Excuse me.

1453
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:54,460
Are you happy?

1454
01:33:54,496 --> 01:33:55,605
It went very well.

1455
01:33:55,629 --> 01:33:56,991
A really great performance.

1456
01:33:57,015 --> 01:33:59,265
You really think so?

1457
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,032
Yes.

1458
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:00,816
No kidding,

1459
01:34:00,852 --> 01:34:01,884
you were terrific.

1460
01:34:01,919 --> 01:34:03,619
Oh... thanks to you...

1461
01:34:03,654 --> 01:34:04,754
to you all.

1462
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:07,523
And to you, for changing

1463
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,759
that fucking director.

1464
01:34:09,794 --> 01:34:11,277
They're waiting
for you, Miss Didi.

1465
01:34:11,313 --> 01:34:12,512
I'm coming.

1466
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,183
She really looks good!

1467
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:28,544
Let's go to the beach.

1468
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:29,712
What about the party?

1469
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:32,882
They're expecting
you at the party.

1470
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,350
Drive me to the beach.

1471
01:35:01,512 --> 01:35:03,495
Do you think
you'll ever finish it,

1472
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,365
so you can live in it?

1473
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,929
I think you like it as it is.

1474
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,323
I think you like
it without a roof.

1475
01:35:16,694 --> 01:35:18,327
You think it needs a roof?

1476
01:35:18,362 --> 01:35:21,347
If you don't want one,
it doesn't need one.

1477
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,750
It's your house.

1478
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:31,224
When are you going
back to college?

1479
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,769
Any time.

1480
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:48,691
Yes?

1481
01:35:48,726 --> 01:35:50,943
Will you hold one
moment, please?

1482
01:35:58,185 --> 01:36:00,319
Miss Kathleen Moore.

1483
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:06,375
Hello.

1484
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:07,877
I got your letter.

1485
01:36:07,912 --> 01:36:09,611
Yes?

1486
01:36:09,647 --> 01:36:11,347
Listen, I must see you.

1487
01:36:11,382 --> 01:36:13,582
It's very difficult.

1488
01:36:13,617 --> 01:36:15,852
It's essential. You know that.

1489
01:36:15,887 --> 01:36:16,853
Look, we have the weekend.

1490
01:36:16,888 --> 01:36:17,998
Come away for the weekend.

1491
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,599
I can't.

1492
01:36:19,623 --> 01:36:20,756
You must.

1493
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:22,842
We must have time to talk.

1494
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:23,954
I'll tell you tomorrow.

1495
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:26,879
No, you must say yes now.

1496
01:36:26,915 --> 01:36:28,597
Say yes.

1497
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:32,167
Yes.

1498
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:00,958
I'll be going away this
afternoon for the weekend.

1499
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,515
Cancel all my appointments.

1500
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:03,516
I'll be unreachable.

1501
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:04,728
You're meeting with Mr. Brimmer

1502
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:05,996
at Miss Brady's
tonight for drinks.

1503
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,631
Cancel it... I'll see
him on Monday.

1504
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,021
Fine.

1505
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:10,756
This just came for you.

1506
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:57,700
Monroe?

1507
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:02,224
Keep going.

1508
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:09,465
Sugar, Mr. Brimmer?

1509
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,940
No, thank you, Miss Brady.

1510
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:15,515
Sugar, Monroe?

1511
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:16,872
No, thank you.

1512
01:38:19,843 --> 01:38:21,621
Who designed these rooms...

1513
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,029
Your father?

1514
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:24,964
My father asked a designer

1515
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:27,116
to design it.

1516
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,185
Well, he designed
them, all right.

1517
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:39,442
Thank you.

1518
01:38:44,635 --> 01:38:46,268
Thank you.

1519
01:38:46,304 --> 01:38:48,344
I thought it would
be a nice quiet place

1520
01:38:48,373 --> 01:38:51,040
for you two to meet.

1521
01:38:51,075 --> 01:38:53,409
Oh, it is.

1522
01:38:53,444 --> 01:38:55,964
It's a very nice room.

1523
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,538
Know California
well, Mr. Brimmer?

1524
01:39:22,573 --> 01:39:25,974
No... I spend most of
my time in New York.

1525
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:26,975
Busy?

1526
01:39:27,011 --> 01:39:29,078
Oh, yes.

1527
01:39:29,113 --> 01:39:31,080
Your name's well-known here.

1528
01:39:31,115 --> 01:39:34,533
And yours is well-known
in New York, Mr. Stahr.

1529
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:37,052
You have done well by water...

1530
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,754
and you by land.

1531
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:41,723
What?

1532
01:39:41,758 --> 01:39:43,092
<i>Anthony and Cleopatra...</i>

1533
01:39:43,127 --> 01:39:44,259
Didn't you recognize it?

1534
01:39:44,295 --> 01:39:45,427
Shakespeare?

1535
01:39:45,463 --> 01:39:46,957
No, I didn't get any
Shakespeare at school.

1536
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,582
How about you, Mr. Brimmer?

1537
01:39:51,251 --> 01:39:53,135
Oh, a bit.

1538
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:05,231
Where do you come from?

1539
01:40:07,184 --> 01:40:09,017
Tennessee.

1540
01:40:09,052 --> 01:40:10,218
Baptist.

1541
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,020
I'm New York. Jewish.

1542
01:40:12,957 --> 01:40:15,140
I know.

1543
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:17,020
Oh, at least we're
all Americans.

1544
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:19,978
We sure are, Mr. Stahr.

1545
01:40:35,997 --> 01:40:37,797
Well...

1546
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:39,131
Well, I'm glad
you came out here.

1547
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:40,167
I wanted to talk to you.

1548
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,184
You've got my writers all upset.

1549
01:40:42,219 --> 01:40:44,331
Keeps them from going to sleep,

1550
01:40:44,355 --> 01:40:45,582
doesn't it?

1551
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:47,539
I want them awake, but
I don't want them crazy.

1552
01:40:47,575 --> 01:40:48,855
Well...

1553
01:40:49,661 --> 01:40:50,704
we're simply concerned

1554
01:40:50,728 --> 01:40:52,272
that they have the
proper protection.

1555
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:53,796
That's all.

1556
01:40:53,832 --> 01:40:54,931
Who from, me?

1557
01:40:56,834 --> 01:41:01,404
You're a very good
employer, Mr. Stahr, but, uh...

1558
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:04,673
we still think that
the position can be...

1559
01:41:04,709 --> 01:41:06,359
rationalized.

1560
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:08,545
I'll tell you three things:

1561
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,412
all writers are children;

1562
01:41:10,448 --> 01:41:13,082
50% are drunks; and
up till very recently,

1563
01:41:13,117 --> 01:41:15,217
writers in Hollywood
were gag men.

1564
01:41:15,252 --> 01:41:16,630
Most of them still are gag men,

1565
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:19,088
but we call them writers.

1566
01:41:19,123 --> 01:41:21,558
Uh-huh.

1567
01:41:21,593 --> 01:41:25,528
But, uh... they're still the
farmers in this business.

1568
01:41:25,564 --> 01:41:28,431
They grow the grain, but
they're not in at the feast.

1569
01:41:28,466 --> 01:41:30,644
It looks to me like a try
for power, Mr. Brimmer,

1570
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:31,934
and I will not give them power.

1571
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:32,996
I'll give them money;

1572
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:35,104
I won't give them power.

1573
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,260
Anyway, they're not
equipped for authority.

1574
01:41:42,814 --> 01:41:44,330
More coffee, Mr. Brimmer?

1575
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:48,117
No, thank you.

1576
01:41:48,152 --> 01:41:49,986
Monroe?

1577
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:51,220
No.

1578
01:41:55,893 --> 01:41:58,027
I don't get to meet
Reds very often.

1579
01:41:58,063 --> 01:42:00,729
Are you a real Red?

1580
01:42:00,765 --> 01:42:02,432
A real one.

1581
01:42:02,467 --> 01:42:03,666
Please do.

1582
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:06,535
Well, I guess some
of you believe in it.

1583
01:42:06,571 --> 01:42:08,237
Quite a few.

1584
01:42:09,424 --> 01:42:10,806
Not you.

1585
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:12,158
Oh, yes.

1586
01:42:12,193 --> 01:42:13,776
Oh, no.

1587
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,846
Oh, yes.

1588
01:42:21,602 --> 01:42:22,618
Monroe!

1589
01:42:24,406 --> 01:42:26,605
Monroe!

1590
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:37,244
All the stars come here to eat.

1591
01:42:37,268 --> 01:42:38,400
Oh, really?

1592
01:42:38,436 --> 01:42:43,105
Is, uh... Greta Garbo here?

1593
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,558
No.

1594
01:42:45,593 --> 01:42:47,854
A pity.

1595
01:42:47,878 --> 01:42:49,612
Mr. Stahr...

1596
01:42:49,647 --> 01:42:50,740
Good evening, Mr. Stahr.

1597
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:51,875
May I have a picture, please?

1598
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,682
Mr. Stahr...

1599
01:42:53,718 --> 01:42:55,051
please?

1600
01:42:58,156 --> 01:43:00,323
Brimmer.

1601
01:43:00,358 --> 01:43:02,691
Want your photograph taken?

1602
01:43:02,727 --> 01:43:05,328
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer not.

1603
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:10,132
Wouldn't they have liked that
photograph back in New York?

1604
01:43:10,168 --> 01:43:11,133
Same again.

1605
01:43:11,169 --> 01:43:12,134
Yes, sir.

1606
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:13,836
Two of us happy and smiling?

1607
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:17,290
Why, they'd have
been tickled pink.

1608
01:43:17,325 --> 01:43:18,769
Three of us happy and smiling.

1609
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:22,178
Oh, of course, with the
beautiful boss's daughter.

1610
01:43:23,732 --> 01:43:24,758
Well, they'd have liked her.

1611
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,026
Did I say

1612
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:27,177
"the beautiful boss's daughter"?

1613
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:29,241
I meant "the boss's
beautiful daughter."

1614
01:43:30,638 --> 01:43:32,254
Isn't Mr. Brady your boss?

1615
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:35,090
No, he's not my boss.

1616
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:36,726
And he's not beautiful either.

1617
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:39,162
What's not beautiful about him?

1618
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:41,781
Same again.

1619
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,399
Listen.

1620
01:43:44,435 --> 01:43:45,401
I like writers.

1621
01:43:45,437 --> 01:43:46,568
I understand writers.

1622
01:43:47,772 --> 01:43:48,904
Sure you do.

1623
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:56,028
I mean, I...

1624
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:57,763
I don't think that...

1625
01:43:57,798 --> 01:43:59,309
I have more
brains than a writer,

1626
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:01,534
I just think that his
brains belong to me.

1627
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:03,731
I know how to use them.

1628
01:44:03,755 --> 01:44:06,439
Well, you know yourself
very well, Mr. Stahr.

1629
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:11,828
Here you are, sir.

1630
01:44:11,863 --> 01:44:12,863
Thank you.

1631
01:44:17,935 --> 01:44:20,403
Now I know you've
been disappointed in love.

1632
01:44:20,438 --> 01:44:21,654
What?

1633
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:23,272
That's your fourth scotch.

1634
01:44:23,308 --> 01:44:24,484
Oh, come on,

1635
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,453
don't be silly, I never drink.

1636
01:44:26,477 --> 01:44:28,656
I know you don't,

1637
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,880
but that's your fourth scotch.

1638
01:44:32,116 --> 01:44:34,750
Well, I haven't
tasted any of them.

1639
01:44:38,523 --> 01:44:41,324
Well, this is the first
drink I had in a week.

1640
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:42,325
Did my drinking

1641
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,325
in the navy.

1642
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:44,437
You hear that?

1643
01:44:44,461 --> 01:44:46,045
This soapbox son of a bitch

1644
01:44:46,081 --> 01:44:47,847
has been working on the navy.

1645
01:44:51,803 --> 01:44:54,937
Well, uh...

1646
01:44:54,972 --> 01:44:56,984
thanks for the dinner and
the meeting, but I must go.

1647
01:44:57,008 --> 01:44:58,540
I have to talk to some people.

1648
01:44:58,576 --> 01:45:01,277
You mean, you
have friends out here?

1649
01:45:01,312 --> 01:45:02,372
Dessert, sir?

1650
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:03,796
That's right.

1651
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:04,797
No, thank you.

1652
01:45:04,832 --> 01:45:06,098
Oh, no, wait.

1653
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:08,033
You've got time.

1654
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:10,069
We're going to go
back to your house.

1655
01:45:10,104 --> 01:45:11,882
We're going to have
one game of Ping-Pong,

1656
01:45:11,906 --> 01:45:14,123
one more drink...

1657
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:17,810
and then I'm going to
tell you what I really think.

1658
01:45:26,504 --> 01:45:29,639
You play Ping-Pong
well, Mr. Stahr?

1659
01:45:56,534 --> 01:45:58,017
Is this Ping-Pong?

1660
01:45:58,052 --> 01:45:59,534
He can't play.

1661
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:06,459
Saturday is a...
a night to relax.

1662
01:46:39,877 --> 01:46:41,643
Hey, you're pretty good.

1663
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,590
You're not so bad yourself.

1664
01:46:57,629 --> 01:47:00,195
I'm going to beat up Brimmer.

1665
01:47:00,231 --> 01:47:02,865
I'm going to handle
this thing personally.

1666
01:47:07,939 --> 01:47:09,839
Can't you pay somebody to do it?

1667
01:47:09,874 --> 01:47:11,519
No, I do my own dirty work.

1668
01:47:11,543 --> 01:47:12,508
Mm-hmm.

1669
01:47:12,544 --> 01:47:14,154
I'm going to beat
the hell out of you,

1670
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:16,812
and I'm going to put you
on a train, Mr. Brimmer.

1671
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,113
Now, stop this.

1672
01:47:18,148 --> 01:47:19,315
Now, stop it!

1673
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:23,485
This man has an
influence on you.

1674
01:47:26,324 --> 01:47:29,558
He has an influence
on all you young people.

1675
01:47:29,594 --> 01:47:31,971
You don't know
what you're doing.

1676
01:47:31,995 --> 01:47:33,755
Please, go home.

1677
01:47:50,415 --> 01:47:53,216
I always wanted
to hit $10 million.

1678
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:58,087
Please... go home.

1679
01:48:01,492 --> 01:48:03,859
Can I do anything?

1680
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:13,602
Well, uh... thanks.

1681
01:48:17,708 --> 01:48:19,875
Thanks for the game.

1682
01:48:30,854 --> 01:48:32,154
What happened?

1683
01:48:32,189 --> 01:48:33,972
He's gone.

1684
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:39,244
Did I hit him?

1685
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:41,464
Oh, yes, quite badly.

1686
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:58,252
I didn't want to hurt him.

1687
01:49:58,276 --> 01:50:02,478
I just... I just wanted
to chase him out, like...

1688
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,224
I didn't want to hurt him.

1689
01:50:04,248 --> 01:50:06,293
I just wanted to chase him out.

1690
01:50:06,317 --> 01:50:09,451
I guess he got
scared and he hit me.

1691
01:50:09,487 --> 01:50:11,086
Do you hold it against him?

1692
01:50:11,121 --> 01:50:14,056
Oh, no, I... no, I'm drunk.

1693
01:50:19,197 --> 01:50:20,796
I'm drunk.

1694
01:50:24,335 --> 01:50:27,903
How would you like to go out to
Doug Fairbanks' ranch with me

1695
01:50:27,938 --> 01:50:29,104
and spend the night?

1696
01:50:29,139 --> 01:50:31,073
I know he would
love to have you.

1697
01:50:53,263 --> 01:50:54,663
There you go.

1698
01:52:27,541 --> 01:52:28,573
Sleep.

1699
01:52:57,154 --> 01:52:58,787
Monroe.

1700
01:53:01,976 --> 01:53:06,378
Monroe, I've called an emergency
meeting of the board at 12:00...

1701
01:53:06,413 --> 01:53:08,146
My office at the studio.

1702
01:53:09,716 --> 01:53:11,066
We'd be glad if you could come.

1703
01:53:22,062 --> 01:53:23,342
Morning, darling.

1704
01:53:27,835 --> 01:53:31,269
Your Monroe was in
great form last night.

1705
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:32,584
See you later.

1706
01:54:01,952 --> 01:54:03,232
Ah, Monroe.

1707
01:54:04,888 --> 01:54:06,168
Come in.

1708
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:14,529
Sit down.

1709
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:23,538
I've just been
speaking with New York.

1710
01:54:23,574 --> 01:54:25,518
They've asked me to tell you

1711
01:54:25,542 --> 01:54:27,603
that they no longer
consider you competent

1712
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:29,194
to negotiate with the writers.

1713
01:54:30,464 --> 01:54:31,808
They've asked me
to be the spokesman

1714
01:54:31,832 --> 01:54:34,533
of this board in all
further discussions.

1715
01:54:34,568 --> 01:54:36,329
They don't consider that, uh,

1716
01:54:36,353 --> 01:54:38,414
trying to beat up the
writers' representative

1717
01:54:38,438 --> 01:54:39,849
is in the company's
best interest.

1718
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:44,026
I just want to say that this
board endorses these views.

1719
01:54:44,061 --> 01:54:48,012
We also recommend that
you go away for a long rest.

1720
01:54:48,048 --> 01:54:50,565
Take a break.

1721
01:54:50,601 --> 01:54:53,067
Go to Tahiti or somewhere.

1722
01:55:05,532 --> 01:55:07,883
This studio will
fall without me.

1723
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:15,089
Take a break, Monroe.

1724
01:55:18,562 --> 01:55:20,128
This is a waste of time.

1725
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:22,030
I'll be talking to New York.

1726
01:55:27,604 --> 01:55:29,887
They'll be glad
to speak with you,

1727
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:31,255
anytime.

1728
01:55:34,494 --> 01:55:35,671
Oh...

1729
01:55:35,695 --> 01:55:39,081
and they said, "Be sure and
see a doctor about that eye."

1730
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:42,412
Mr. Stahr.

1731
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:45,553
We'll see the
studio doesn't fall.

1732
01:56:18,989 --> 01:56:20,232
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1733
01:56:20,256 --> 01:56:21,522
<i>I can't ask you in.</i>

1734
01:56:31,534 --> 01:56:33,494
<i>So how do you want the girl?</i>

1735
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:41,275
<i>I want a quiet life.</i>

1736
01:56:45,865 --> 01:56:48,366
<i>Any... pain?</i>

1737
01:56:55,542 --> 01:56:57,976
Suppose you're in your office...

1738
01:57:01,114 --> 01:57:04,515
You've been fighting duels
all day, you're exhausted.

1739
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:11,556
This is you.

1740
01:57:14,244 --> 01:57:16,144
<i>The girl comes in.</i>

1741
01:57:16,179 --> 01:57:19,180
<i>She doesn't see you.</i>

1742
01:57:19,216 --> 01:57:22,484
<i>She takes off her
gloves, opens her purse,</i>

1743
01:57:22,519 --> 01:57:24,602
<i>dumps it out on the table.</i>

1744
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:28,923
You watch her.

1745
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:30,258
This is you.

1746
01:57:36,266 --> 01:57:42,637
She has two dimes, a
matchbox and a nickel.

1747
01:57:42,673 --> 01:57:45,640
She leaves the
nickel on the table,

1748
01:57:45,676 --> 01:57:49,010
puts the two dimes
back into her purse,

1749
01:57:49,046 --> 01:57:53,414
takes the gloves to the stove,
opens it, puts them inside.

1750
01:57:53,449 --> 01:57:54,683
She lights a match.

1751
01:57:54,718 --> 01:57:56,685
Suddenly, the telephone rings.

1752
01:57:58,805 --> 01:58:00,905
<i>She picks it up.</i>

1753
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:02,540
<i>She listens.</i>

1754
01:58:02,576 --> 01:58:05,777
<i>She says, "I've never
owned a pair of black gloves</i>

1755
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:06,911
<i>in my life."</i>

1756
01:58:06,946 --> 01:58:10,148
<i>Hangs up, kneels by the
stove, lights another match.</i>

1757
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:15,319
Suddenly, you notice...

1758
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:20,425
there's another man in the room

1759
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:22,460
<i>watching every
move the girl makes.</i>

1760
01:58:43,083 --> 01:58:44,763
<i>What happens?</i>

1761
01:58:46,653 --> 01:58:48,869
I don't know.

1762
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,980
I was just making pictures.

1763
01:59:16,733 --> 01:59:18,866
I don't want to lose you.

1764
01:59:58,742 --> 02:00:02,042
<i>I don't want to lose you.</i>
