1
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,873
He stole the chip, he's inside.

2
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,876
I see him.

3
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,692
Kirill!

4
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,362
Time to work.

5
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,066
NSA Remote Intelligence Facility
Mt. Weather, Virginia

6
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,842
At 0030 hours, the mission
deviated from the set parameters.

7
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,804
It wasn't part of the plan
for our agent to get shot in the back.

8
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,645
Identity confirmed.

9
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,315
McGrath was uploading some data
to us when he was killed.

10
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,777
Take a look at this.
I’m not sure yet exactly what it is.

11
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,408
-A fragment of a complex molecule.
-Gibbons.

12
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,828
We think it's a link
to a Soviet bio-weapon...

13
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,705
...called Silent Night.

14
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,000
-James, what the hell is he doing here?
-I called him in.

15
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,045
We've lost three agents already.
You could use the help.

16
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,507
I found out your agents were killed by
this group, Anarchy 99.

17
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:03,095
They're ex-military. They can smell
the training on our agents a mile away.

18
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,349
Sir, I think it's time we tried
something new.

19
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,111
These guys aren't ours.
Who are they? CIA?

20
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,532
No, civilians. Convicts, mercs,
contract killers.

21
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,034
The best and brightest
of the bottom of the barrel.

22
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,539
-They're the scum of the earth.
-And they are programmable, expendable, effective.

23
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,458
I think it's our best shot.

24
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,795
Do we want to drop another
mouse in the snake pit?

25
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,382
Or send our own snake
and let him crawl in?

26
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,389
Sacramento, California

27
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,896
Come on, Pepe. This is unbelievable.

28
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,315
Hello!

29
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,193
Well, it's about time. Now, listen....

30
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,571
Were you coming from Tijuana?
I don't mean to be rude.

31
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,574
Keep it out of the sun.
I don't want the paint to fade.

32
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,286
Do you understand English?
I pay enough for you people.

33
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,793
Come on, Janelle.
You're gonna love this place.

34
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,380
-Dick, how are you?
-This is Janelle.

35
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,266
-Call 911.
-Who's driving my car?

36
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,108
Hotchkiss, senator Hotchkiss!
California state Senate!

37
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,569
Listen, somebody just stole my car!

38
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,014
You, in the red Corvette!
Pull over immediately!

39
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,686
Yeah, yeah. These monkeys are
following me because I took this car.

40
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,772
Obviously the car doesn't belong to me,
it's not my style.

41
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,236
It belongs to Dick, Dick Hotchkiss,
a California state senator.

42
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,364
You remember Dick.
He tried to ban rap music...

43
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,617
...because he feels the lyrics
promote violence.

44
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,160
It's music, Dick!

45
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,999
He also wants to pull every video game
off every shelf in the country...

46
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:42,963
...because he feels that the video games
diminish the intelligence of our youth.

47
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,132
Come on, Dick.

48
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,135
It's the only education we got.

49
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,724
You're a bad man.
You know what we do to bad men.

50
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,434
We punish them.

51
00:07:55,642 --> 00:08:01,523
Dick, you've just entered
the Xander zone.

52
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,152
I’m coming in hot with a side of bacon!

53
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,704
Go, go, go!

54
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,643
Pull it! Pull it!

55
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,957
Yes!

56
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,359
Go get the cameras! Go! Go! Go!

57
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,033
Moral is, don't be a dick, Dick!

58
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:45,544
You guys got the cameras?
All right, let's go, let's go!

59
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,926
Peace out!

60
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,503
Outstanding.

61
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,505
Thank you.

62
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,175
-What's up?
-You invited these people?

63
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,593
Of course not.

64
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,308
That's my dog! What's up?

65
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,394
Today was off the hook!
You're psycho, bro!

66
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,356
Psycho? That was off the chain, man!

67
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:52,694
Yo, yo, yo! What's up with that crazy
trick that we've been hearing about?

68
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:56,198
-My Superman seat-grab barrel roll?
-Word.

69
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,825
I’m still working on it.

70
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,663
You're a hard guy to get a hold of.

71
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:07,292
You know, an athlete like you should
really have his own video game.

72
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:11,088
Jordan King. I can make it happen.

73
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,883
-I’ll hold on to this for later.
-You do that.

74
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,475
You know he'll never sell out.
That's why he is who he is.

75
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,353
So you need to relax.
Who invited you, anyway?

76
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,355
Shut up.

77
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:37,155
Listen, this is for real. I can get us
an advance on lnternet pre-sales.

78
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,158
So you need to just go to Pago Pago
or something.

79
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,495
Get some girls, do them all.
I don't care. Go on vacation.

80
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:47,332
It's Bora Bora, J.
I got enough girls here.

81
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,335
Since when did you care so much
about money?

82
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,547
I just need you to lay low
till the heat's off, okay?

83
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:58,677
I run an underground website. I got tapes to
make and I can't do that with you in jail.

84
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:02,055
-Did you see that?
-I don't care. Listen to me.

85
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,891
I’m untouchable.

86
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,819
Let's go! Get out! Move!

87
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,905
Okay, I’ll turn down the music.

88
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,956
It was only a Corvette.

89
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,339
Let's go, baby.
Your order is getting cold.

90
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,014
-Want coffee?
-Can you give me some hash browns?

91
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,809
-Sure.
-Make them sloppy. I like them runny.

92
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,937
How did I get here?

93
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:54,858
Two big guys dropped you off 10 minutes
ago. Told me to look after you.

94
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,653
You look like you could use
some coffee.

95
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,379
You all right?

96
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,047
Fine.

97
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,190
I said, you got a problem, boy?

98
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,859
No. No problem.

99
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,279
-Nobody make a move!
-Nobody move!

100
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,908
Just couldn't let him leave.
Keep your goddamned mouth shut!

101
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:49,329
-Keep still or you'll stop breathing.
-Empty the goddamn register!

102
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,961
Get back!

103
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,963
Get back. Get back!

104
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,556
-Well done, Mr. Cage.
-Who the hell are you?

105
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,810
The name's Gibbons. Augustus Gibbons.

106
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,688
You seem upset. Is there a problem?

107
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,399
-What is this place?
-Looks like a diner.

108
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,693
That's clever.

109
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,363
You almost had me going there
for a while.

110
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:27,701
I was a bit groggy before,
then I started noticing things.

111
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,955
Like, you got a stockbroker over here,
all dressed up...

112
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:37,336
...reading the "Financial Times"
on a Sunday morning when the market's closed.

113
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,964
Unlikely, but okay, I can go with that.

114
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:45,219
I could even go with the stick-up man
packing a cop-issue Beretta.

115
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,431
But you want to know where you blew it?
With her.

116
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,601
My aunt was in the restaurant business all her life.

117
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,189
There's no way in hell a career
 waitress comes to work in high heels.

118
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,942
She'd have blisters
the size of pancakes.

119
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,862
And if she ain't real, then this whole
thing ain't real.

120
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,533
That's how I knew that this bozo
wouldn't get a shot off...

121
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,619
...even if we waited
till St. Patrick's Day.

122
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,791
Because there's nothing but blanks
in these guns.

123
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,587
Oh, and no offense...

124
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,133
...but their performances were terrible.

125
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,476
That's good. That's very good.

126
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,771
It's your turn, pretty boy.

127
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:43,777
-What the hell is going on here?
-It was a test that you aced.

128
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,448
-He seems to have a poor attitude.
-Excuse me?

129
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:52,244
-Should we throw him back?
-Hell, no. I love his attitude.

130
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,414
Let's take this to the next level.
Get on the Sat-Com.

131
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,749
Take what to the next level?

132
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,128
-Yo! Take what?
-I want everybody out in 10 minutes.

133
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,173
Idon't know who you think you playing with,
I don't play this game.

134
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,843
-Get Mike a doctor or he'll look like me.
-I got a party.

135
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,470
-Shut him up.
-And don't forget to pay for my windows!

136
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,732
Why is it always the assholes
who pass the tests?

137
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,342
You guys haven't been
to any diners lately, huh?

138
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,387
Diner finalists.

139
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,773
-What, no coffee?
-Oh, yeah.

140
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,192
-Here comes the ROTC.
-Here we go.

141
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,862
-Where's my peanuts?
-Nice.

142
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,533
Can you ask for the stewardess?

143
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,833
-"Standing by to deploy drogue."
-Roger, deploying drogue parachute.

144
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,885
-This will hurt.
-What the hell?

145
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,610
-"Release drogue now."
-Roger.

146
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,948
This ain't right!

147
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,783
I live for this shit!

148
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,304
Not bad!

149
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,349
Let's do that again!

150
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,533
Holy shit. This is Colombia.

151
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,786
Cocaine, man. These are coke plants!

152
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,044
No keys.

153
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:53,050
-What the hell are you doing?
-You know what this shit's worth?

154
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,013
What now? Is this another test?

155
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,475
-Let's go across the river. Let's go!
-Yeah, good idea! Good idea!

156
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,195
I guess you monkeys are too good for me.
I guess I failed this test.

157
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,325
You guys got something to drink?

158
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,840
Nice to see you again, fellas.

159
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,758
Yeah, you too.

160
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,345
Boy, they went all out on this one.

161
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,375
You've got to be kidding.

162
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,467
Okay, funny guys.

163
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,471
I’ll show you what we do
when you get in our business.

164
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,143
What? Hog-tie us and force us
to listen to your bad accent?

165
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,228
No.

166
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:33,901
We cut their Achilles tendon and watch
them flop around like a marionette.

167
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:38,780
Unless you have something to tell me,
something I need to know?

168
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,492
Okay. You're short.

169
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,457
My friend says you could use a haircut
to update your style. Get off me.

170
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,919
Shut up!

171
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:56,089
Two seconds ago you told us to talk.
Now it's "Shut up?"

172
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,552
I don't mean to nitpick, but you're
the worst at this torture thing.

173
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,308
You slap me again,
I’m going to throw you a beating.

174
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,816
I hope they're paying you
extra for this.

175
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:19,321
You know what, funny guy?
Maybe I’ll cut off your nose first.

176
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,907
Funny guy.

177
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:26,787
What's funny is, this actually smells
like real blood.

178
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,292
I hope you like it, because it's the
last thing you're going to smell.

179
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,945
I’m hit! I’m hit! I’m hit!

180
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,995
Virg! Give me a hand.

181
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,424
This is the Colombian army!

182
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,217
Give up, you're surrounded!

183
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,224
Try to walk, T.J. Try to walk.

184
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,185
Virg! Get out here!

185
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,856
To hell with this.
Every man for himself.

186
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,464
I’ll get us some wheels.

187
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,758
Hang in there.

188
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,009
Good luck.

189
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,668
The guy on the bike,
that's the drug lord!

190
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,170
Let's get him!

191
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:39,813
T.J.!

192
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,935
X! I’m over here! X!

193
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,747
There he is!

194
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,025
We toasted his ass!

195
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,746
I got us a bike.

196
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,587
Pussies!

197
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:04,476
Look who it is. Frankenstein. Uncuff me
so I can beat the shit out of you.

198
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:07,938
Relax, X, you just graduated
at the head of your CIAss.

199
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,775
What are you talking about?
You almost got us killed.

200
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,486
-We knew the army was moving.
-Excuse me?

201
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:18,282
It was my idea to send you as
a decoy. How do you like that?

202
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:25,831
-You're pretty fast for an old man.
-Get up.

203
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,419
Walk with me.

204
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:36,884
I believe under the right
circumstances, a man can change.

205
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,929
For instance, last night you exhibited
courage, leadership...

206
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,765
...and willingness to protect
a man you hardly knew.

207
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:47,269
-So give me a medal.
-I’d rather give you a job.

208
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:51,440
Look at me. Do I look like a fan
of law enforcement?

209
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,942
This is your lucky day, Xander.

210
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:56,862
This is your chance
to pay your Uncle Sam...

211
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,281
...for all your wonderful freedoms you've enjoyed.

212
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,283
The job's not that difficult.

213
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:05,120
I want you to meet people and
find out whatever you can about them.

214
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,955
What type of people?

215
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:12,419
Dangerous, dirty, tattooed,
uncivilized. Your kind of people.

216
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,130
Hold up.

217
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:20,802
My kind of people would say,
"Kiss my ass, scarface."

218
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,140
Usually I’d take my gun,
press it to your temple...

219
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:28,310
...and ask you very politely
to do what I want.

220
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,105
But you're not afraid of death.
That puts us in a quandary.

221
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:35,776
-We better call this a day, then.
-Not just yet.

222
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,905
You ever watch lions at the zoo?

223
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:45,244
You can tell which were captured
in the wild by the look in their eyes.

224
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,495
The wild cat.

225
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,666
She remembers running across the plain,
the thrill of the hunt.

226
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:54,795
Four hundred pounds of killing fury
locked in a box.

227
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,298
But after a while,
their eyes glaze over...

228
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,385
...and you can tell
their soul has died.

229
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,096
The same thing happens to a man.

230
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,974
Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary
is no joke.

231
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,144
They'll take a wild man and
throw him in solitary just for fun.

232
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:16,900
No more mountains to board,
no more oceans to surf.

233
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:22,364
Just a 6-by-8 cell with no window
and only a bucket to shit in.

234
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,951
You can avoid that
by doing me this favor.

235
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,245
You don't have shit on me.

236
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:32,374
I noticed you have three X's
tattooed on the back of your neck.

237
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,172
I think that's rather appropriate since
you're looking at three strikes.

238
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:42,968
Grand theft, reckless endangerment,
and that bridge stunt of yours...

239
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,554
...makes you a three-time loser.

240
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:48,682
Maybe you ought to call yourself
"Triple X."

241
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:54,354
But if you do what I want, I’ll make
all your transgressions go away...

242
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,150
...and let you get back
to that pathetic excuse of a life.

243
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,905
Or you think maybe
I should be like you.

244
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,284
Get all shot up for the old
Stars and Stripes.

245
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:12,206
I bet that flag is a real comfort
every time you look in the mirror.

246
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:17,252
A small price I paid for putting
foot to ass for my country.

247
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,718
So, what's it going to be, Triple X?

248
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,387
You want to get on a plane...

249
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:32,267
...or is "Kiss my ass, scarface"
your final answer?

250
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,781
Prague, Czech Republic

251
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,965
Yo. What's your name, slick?

252
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,466
My name is lvan.

253
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,804
-lvan? What's your name, buddy?
-My name is lvan.

254
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:10,681
You're both lvan?

255
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,753
Take a seat.

256
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,174
Idiots! Where is the American agent?

257
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:46,466
This is him, Sir.

258
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,679
We better order another bodybag.

259
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,432
Guys, what's up?

260
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,435
I told you to sit down.

261
00:32:56,894 --> 00:33:00,647
I’ve just been on a plane for 12 hours.
I think I’ll stand.

262
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:04,026
My name is Milan Sova,
Czech secret police.

263
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,737
Here, you are under my jurisdiction.

264
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,364
You take my orders,
you do what I say.

265
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,993
If you become any kind of an
inconvenience, I’ll shoot you.

266
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,079
That's great.
Is this where I’m staying?

267
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:19,541
Your government is putting pressure
on mine.

268
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,587
This is an internal Czech affair
that you are interfering with.

269
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,757
I will warn you once:
Don't shit in my lawn.

270
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:31,595
Get whatever information
your government seeks and get out.

271
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,555
Let's get this straight.

272
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:37,476
You may not want me here,
but I definitely don't want to be here.

273
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:41,063
Two, I’ve never been
under anyone's jurisdiction.

274
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,066
Three, if you're going to
shoot anybody...

275
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,902
...shoot that monkey
that sold you the suit.

276
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,613
Now, I’m tired. I’m going to sleep.

277
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:54,159
Be ready in three hours.

278
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,583
Everybody in this club
has two things in common:

279
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:07,798
-They're rich and they're criminals.
-I’ll fit in, except for the rich part.

280
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:25,732
-Remember, we don't know each other.
-I wish we didn't.

281
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:42,416
Yeah, can I get a cranberry club soda?

282
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,129
Throw this back there?
I’ll tip you something.

283
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,464
Put it in the back.

284
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,802
How much? Do I get a ticket?

285
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:01,977
That's them. Anarchy 99.

286
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:03,979
You see the guy on the couch?

287
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:06,648
That's Yorgi. He's the leader.

288
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:11,487
He owns this club and five others like
it. All, how do you say, cash cows.

289
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:13,113
American?!

290
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,203
Guys, I’m American.
I’m going to see Yorgi. Yorgi!

291
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,747
Hey, Yorgi! I hear you're the guy--

292
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,836
I heard you're the guy
to talk to about cars.

293
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,421
Take yourself outside.

294
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,174
Take myself outside? I’m just--

295
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:36,637
Okay. I’m not welcome.

296
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,348
Guess you'd rather have cops
in your club.

297
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:43,769
Want to talk?

298
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:47,856
Hey, you silly boy. Come with me
and show me the cop...

299
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,067
...and don't be mistake.

300
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,654
See that guy there,
with the suit made out of drapes?

301
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,531
That's a cop.

302
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,872
Is there a problem?
I just had a drink, you know?

303
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:09,044
I already paid. I’m going to
give a big tip, you know?

304
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:18,846
So, what is this all about?
I've done nothing.

305
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,558
You've done nothing?
Who do you work for?

306
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,061
I work in a bank. So what?

307
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,313
You've got to be....

308
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:32,317
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it!

309
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,822
What's that, your bus pass?

310
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,867
Czech 5-0. Czech 5-0.

311
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,328
Leave my club.

312
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,125
How did you know?

313
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:53,589
When he was paying for his drinks, he
was flashing his badge to half the bar.

314
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:54,965
Cops like plague.

315
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:59,178
No matter how many you pay, there's
always another with his hand out.

316
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,763
I’m from the streets.
I know cops, believe me.

317
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:06,685
I appreciate you bringing this to our
attention. My question to you is why?

318
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:10,022
I figure, no one likes cops
crashing their party.

319
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,941
I figure, I do you a solid,
we could talk.

320
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:16,987
I just want to buy cars, man.

321
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,574
Is this guy going to hump my leg?

322
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,702
What's your name?

323
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,623
Xander Cage.

324
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,251
I knew it.

325
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:35,547
You are amazing on snowboard,
motorbike, everything.

326
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,133
-You're awesome.
-Thank you, man.

327
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:42,596
My brother is crazy too,
and a great admirer of yours.

328
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:46,350
He has seen your tapes many times.
Now we can talk business.

329
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,101
This way, please.

330
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,437
Yelena.

331
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:55,567
Welcome to the Xander zone.

332
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:58,987
Now, that's funny. That's funny.

333
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,073
Sit down, Mr. Cage.

334
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,033
My friends call me X.

335
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,953
So, X, what exactly are you wanting?

336
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:11,500
Ferraris, high-end pasta rockets,
10 to start.

337
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:18,674
This car, number 10, will be very
difficult to find in Europe.

338
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:24,179
That one's for me. I put it in there
to get something out of the deal.

339
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,014
Well, you certainly know your cars.

340
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:29,685
Yeah. Cars, bikes, boards. You name it.

341
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:33,021
I like anything fast enough
to do something stupid in.

342
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,231
Yes.

343
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:38,861
Ten cars is hardly worth the effort.
A lousy 1.5 million, U.S.

344
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,405
Now, hold on a second.

345
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:46,827
The American buyers I represent,
to them, 10 cars is an appetizer.

346
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:50,706
-And it's a mil max, sister.
-How about a million four?

347
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,209
I was thinking more like a mil two.

348
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,298
Do you know what a wire transfer is?

349
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,175
Is she for real?

350
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:04,094
Sweetheart, is there anything
you need to do?

351
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:07,389
Let us big boys have a conversation.

352
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,225
"Conversation," a word
with four syllables.

353
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,478
Do you want some ice
before your brain overheats?

354
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:18,734
lce. Yeah, you could chisel some off
your heart, if you could find it.

355
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,744
This would work a lot faster, princess,
if I had an account number.

356
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:37,503
You have 48 hours
to complete the transfer.

357
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,547
-Don't waste my time.
-I wouldn't dream of it.

358
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:46,512
I might throw in a couple extra
bucks and send you to charm school.

359
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,645
Now that business is finished,
we party.

360
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,233
Bitches, come!

361
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:27,094
Yeah?

362
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,102
Shit, I thought this was a cell phone.

363
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,353
Have a nice rest?

364
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,481
Dial it down.
I got to sleep an hour ago.

365
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:43,735
You were given a specific list of cars.
Who told you to alter it?

366
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:46,864
The cars sucked.
They would've seen through it.

367
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,700
You guys should switch travel agents.

368
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,327
I got that info you wanted.

369
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,496
Hang on a second.

370
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,082
You guys ready for this?

371
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,674
Names, birthdays,
ranks in the Red Army.

372
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,177
Favorite foods?
How did you get this?

373
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:12,306
Kolya, Yorgi's younger brother,
happens to be an action sports fanatic.

374
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,057
So naturally, he's a fan.

375
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,936
But when you kill a bottle of vodka
in three swigs, you'll talk.

376
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,063
-"I got something else."
-What?

377
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,026
Their personal bank account number.
Where did I put that?

378
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:32,367
Stolen cars, nightclubs, prostitution,
extortion.

379
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:36,121
What's the big deal?
We got criminals like this in the U.S.

380
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:38,707
Your job isn't to ask questions.

381
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:42,878
Well, I did my job, thank you.
I’m coming home.

382
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,296
Not just yet.

383
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:49,051
You're a victim of your own success.
Get closer to these guys.

384
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:52,429
-They're cool, but not that cool.
-"Go deeper."

385
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,265
I’ll send a guy with a care package
to help you.

386
00:41:55,432 --> 00:42:00,229
-I thought we had a deal.
-You change cars, I change the deal.

387
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,564
Do this for me, you can come home.

388
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:08,070
If you send someone to save the world,
make sure they like it the way it is.

389
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:23,377
I have a really firm chest.
I bench, like, 225.

390
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:26,380
Like, bench. Weight room. Bye.

391
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:31,009
-That's him.
-Wait. You're Triple X?

392
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:34,847
-You're the care package?
-Agent Toby Lee Shavers.

393
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:36,265
Come on.

394
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:40,018
You have to rate high
to get Gibbons to send this stuff.

395
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:45,107
I kind of wish I was going with you,
mixed up in the fury of the situation.

396
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:48,443
Crazy. License to kill,
death, destruction, mayhem.

397
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:53,574
Got a gun under your pillow. Never know
when some freak villain will pop out.

398
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,369
-How long you been with the agency?
-Two days.

399
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:00,122
You're shitting me. No way.

400
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,416
That sucks.

401
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,127
Yeah, it sucks, but it beats jail.

402
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,588
It sucks because I spent six years...

403
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:12,259
...in the basement of some windowless,
NSA, gadget freak room, man.

404
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,928
And I got a degree.
I got a degree from MIt.

405
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:17,973
Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude.

406
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:22,978
And they probably picked you up,
what, pumping iron in San Quentin?

407
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:26,481
You ever get punched in the face
for talking too much?

408
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:27,858
Show me the stuff.

409
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:32,696
This one made my career,
the definition of perfection:

410
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:36,283
My multi-purpose, multi-function
field revolver.

411
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,788
-Oh, I like this.
-Then you'll love these.

412
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,292
These are all attachment darts.
See the green ones?

413
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,628
Datura knockout darts.

414
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:51,798
Guy goes down for 12 hours, wakes
up, doesn't know who he is...

415
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,219
...and his head's splitting
like a cord of firewood.

416
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:58,388
I was shot twice by those.

417
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:02,059
And the red ones are tranquilizer
and blood-splatter darts.

418
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:06,146
Looks like a kill shot
without the aftereffects. Like death.

419
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,857
You've got exploding and
surveillance darts...

420
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:13,237
...and your standard .44-caliber
bullets, if you want to get nasty.

421
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:17,491
A little wet work. You know
what I’m talking about, right?

422
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,997
Knocked over a few 7-Elevens,
have we?

423
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:29,211
No, I had my leg in a cast for three
months. All I did was play video games.

424
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,213
That's a really sad story.

425
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,549
Check this out, on to my baby.

426
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,971
Eagle Eyes. Nine enhanced-vision modes.

427
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:43,225
Every little boy's dream:
the penetrator mode.

428
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:44,601
Check it out.

429
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:55,696
Oh, my God.

430
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:59,408
-She's checking you out, man.
-I’ll hang on to these.

431
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,119
Now, on to my latest achievement.

432
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:05,873
I just put the finishing touches
on them last week.

433
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,041
What do you think?

434
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:11,295
-Bandages?
-No, Mr. X, watch and learn.

435
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,590
There's enough primer
to blow a hole in a vault...

436
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:18,635
...vaporize a human, or whatever agents
like you might find a use for.

437
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,554
And check this out.

438
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:23,098
The detonator. How cool is that?

439
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:29,313
-You might want to back up for this.
-It's a bandage.

440
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,773
Just get behind the wall.

441
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,943
You ready?

442
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,237
I’ve always wanted to say this.

443
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,157
Fire in the hole.

444
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,224
It's loaded.

445
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:31,041
So, what do you think?
Beautiful.

446
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,877
You like the cars?

447
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,339
I love the cars, they're dope.

448
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:42,302
-You like the money?
-I love money, but I do not have it.

449
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:47,015
You look like you're doing very well.
All these employees, beautiful cars.

450
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:49,476
This is no time for being funny.

451
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:07,828
-You didn't think I wasn't good for it?
-It never crossed my mind.

452
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:14,251
A cargo ship's waiting for you
in Rijeka. Here's the address.

453
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:18,589
This place is dope.

454
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,092
This one's mine?

455
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:23,760
Car number 10.

456
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:28,015
Kolya found it hiding in Berlin.
It was very difficult to find.

457
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:29,766
No! Please.

458
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:33,187
Allow me. You were kind enough
to give me the money.

459
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,905
Now, please...

460
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,865
...drive.

461
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,746
No, allow me.

462
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,429
-You're all right, Yorgi.
-Everything's all right with vodka.

463
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:11,934
You must come to party tonight.
Big party at one of my clubs.

464
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:13,602
-Yeah?
-Yes.

465
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:35,958
What's going on, my friend?

466
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:39,419
You tell me.
You got a sniper up there or what?

467
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,922
He's not with us,
he must be with you.

468
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,133
Bullshit! Tell your men to get down...

469
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:49,096
...or I’ll give you another hole to
breathe out of. Are we clear?

470
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:57,271
All right. It's not yours.

471
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,606
Let's go and get him together.

472
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:36,185
Son of a bitch.
That same cop from the club.

473
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:37,978
Filthy cop.

474
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:11,720
Most people talk a lot.
Few are up for the moment.

475
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:15,224
Welcome to Anarchy 99.

476
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:09,236
Why do you do that to yourself?
That cigarette will kill you one day.

477
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:13,240
I like smoke better than air.
If I could, I’d smoke in my sleep.

478
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:16,285
I would still do it after it kills me.

479
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:37,264
You were talking about Anarchy 99.

480
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,350
What is that, some motorcycle gang
of yours?

481
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:46,315
It's what we've been living since 1999
when we left the army of Mother Russia.

482
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:51,320
Many of our comrades died in combat,
and we said, "To hell with this shit."

483
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,947
They die for what? Politics?

484
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:56,617
Whose politics? Not ours!

485
00:51:56,825 --> 00:52:00,954
So we decide from then on
to do what we want, when we want.

486
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:05,459
It is in their honor
we call ourselves Anarchy 99.

487
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:14,343
You know, there's an old punk song.
It says:

488
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,812
-You got it!
-"Anarchy Burger" by the Vandals.

489
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,316
I’m with you, but what
are you going to do?

490
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:34,238
You got rules and government
everywhere. Always was, always will be.

491
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:36,198
Maybe not always.

492
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,165
Make sure he doesn't get lonely.

493
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,167
Don't be shy.

494
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,052
You want to dance?

495
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:04,518
Hey. Hey!

496
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,862
Hey! I’m really a good dancer.

497
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,410
Make that two.

498
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:25,330
All right, it's going to be like that?

499
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,918
If you're mad at him,
don't take it out on me.

500
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:34,715
I’ve been trying to figure out the deal
between you two all night.

501
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,009
You his woman or what?

502
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:42,556
Yeah, I’m his woman. If you pay me as
much, I’ll be your woman too.

503
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:37,110
-Did you enjoy that?
-Yeah.

504
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,197
Good, because it will
never happen again.

505
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:42,885
The original owners just one day
decide to move out.

506
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,889
-This is amazing, man.
-Make yourself at home.

507
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,897
Let me get your coat.

508
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:05,365
What's up with your boy?
He got a coat fetish?

509
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:07,242
Oh, no.

510
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:11,497
He's in love with her. Dirty fool.

511
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:27,221
Time for bed, X. It's getting early.
Yelena!

512
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,474
Would you kindly
show him his room?

513
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:49,243
-After you.
-No, after you.

514
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:52,204
-No, after you.
-No, I insist.

515
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:58,585
That's it.

516
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,632
Last chance to tuck me in.

517
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:06,844
Good morning.

518
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:59,813
The things I’m going to do
for my country.

519
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,949
It's none of my business, but a power
drill and some titanium bits...

520
00:59:34,116 --> 00:59:35,909
...will get you a lot further than that
camera.

521
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,287
You're not supposed to be in here.

522
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,581
I was on my way to the bathroom.

523
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,960
What's your excuse?

524
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:47,629
I don't need an excuse.

525
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:51,800
Oh, you're good.

526
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,137
But not that good.

527
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:58,640
I came in here to photograph
Yorgi's safe.

528
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,477
I thought it might be worth
a lot to somebody.

529
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:05,355
Come on. You're cold,
intelligent and vicious.

530
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,568
It's your eyes that give you away.

531
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:13,489
They gave you away
when I shot that cop.

532
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:18,076
What are you going to do now?

533
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:25,000
Now I’m going to take you to lunch.

534
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:30,297
Oh, and that cop I shot, isn't dead.

535
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:53,403
I have some information for you.

536
01:00:55,239 --> 01:01:00,244
I can always use information. Who
is this? How did you get this number?

537
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:06,667
Yes. Important information
that you need about Xander Cage.

538
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:21,056
-So you don't like foreigners, do you?
-No, you're a pig.

539
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:24,434
Is your boyfriend a pig too?

540
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:27,187
You should recognize one of your kind.

541
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,231
Now, tell me about the cop.

542
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:34,945
What if I told you I’m not
who you think I am?

543
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,282
That I could get you out of
the mess you're in?

544
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,742
Really? And what mess am I in?

545
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:45,998
The mess that makes you sneak around
the castle when everyone's asleep.

546
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:47,249
The cop?

547
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:54,173
See this?
It's called a blood-splatter dart.

548
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:58,635
The impact's real, but it's harmless.
Red paint, mostly.

549
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:01,555
Why?

550
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:04,975
I’m a secret agent.

551
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:14,651
Are you sure you don't want
to embarrass me?

552
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,613
-Come on.
-What's so funny about that?

553
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,492
I mean, look at you.

554
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:24,244
I work for the NSA.

555
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,916
You're funny, you know that?

556
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:34,796
Yelena, it's Kirill.

557
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,176
Yorgi found out that Cage
is an American agent.

558
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:44,806
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
You are in danger, my love.

559
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:48,185
The building across the street.
The statue.

560
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:52,815
Bring him outside.
I will do the rest.

561
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:01,990
What was that, your boyfriend?

562
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:11,708
Let's say you are
who you say you are.

563
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:16,421
-What can you do for me?
-What do you want?

564
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:23,095
I want immunity from prosecution,
asylum in the U.S. and citizenship.

565
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:25,848
How about a condo on South Beach
and a rich boyfriend?

566
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:28,058
Those I can get for myseIf.

567
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,646
-What do you want?
-I need to know more about Anarchy 99.

568
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,315
You want to know about Anarchy 99?

569
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:39,528
You've seen the girls,
the clubs, the parties.

570
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:43,407
What you don't see
is what goes on during the day.

571
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:49,121
There's been a lot of activity in the
last year. People coming in and out.

572
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:53,167
-Russian scientists.
-Well, what are they up to?

573
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,753
They go in the basement
and I'm not allowed in.

574
01:03:57,254 --> 01:04:00,174
Now's a good time for you
to get invited.

575
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:06,763
Yorgi knows you're an agent.
Kirill is waiting with his rifIe.

576
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:14,188
-Where--?
-Don't look!

577
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:17,274
There's a back door.

578
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,735
They’ll know you warned me.

579
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:23,363
If you go out the front,
he’ll put a bullet in your eye.

580
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,627
-You still packing?
-Always.

581
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,754
Get ready to use it.

582
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:44,843
-What's your plan?
-He's still in love with you.

583
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:50,390
-He’ll wait for a clear shot.
-That's your plan? Thank you. Great.

584
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:15,749
Draw!

585
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:07,301
He's on the way.

586
01:06:44,963 --> 01:06:49,510
Gibbons! My favorite kidnapper.
Next time send a limo.

587
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:59,019
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

588
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:03,315
You already broke me.
No need to get cruel and unusual.

589
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,904
A ticket? Now, that's funny.

590
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:11,698
-Where am I going to go now?
-Home.

591
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:13,492
Home?

592
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:16,078
Your cover's blown.
You're no longer useful.

593
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:17,579
That's it? I'm done?

594
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:21,375
No tricks. We have enough intel
to move forward.

595
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:26,421
-With what?
-Sweeper team: quick, clean, effective.

596
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:29,550
Don't worry about it.
It’ll all be over soon.

597
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:33,428
You mean a sweeper team
to come in and kill everybody?

598
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:36,390
Not all of them are as bad
as you think.

599
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:40,561
You had to shoot a cop. How
''not as bad as I think'' could they be?

600
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:42,896
Okay, look.

601
01:07:43,147 --> 01:07:46,900
We've got a complication.
There's a girl. Yelena.

602
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,569
There's always a girl.

603
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:52,739
She wants out and I sent her back in
to get more intel for you.

604
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:56,994
There's no time to play favorites.
The cards have been dealt.

605
01:07:57,161 --> 01:07:59,830
What do you mean
the cards have been dealt?

606
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:02,291
You don't even know her, man.

607
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:07,379
Oh, by the way, that bank number
you gave us?

608
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:13,677
Your friends and Yelena have made
some large cash transfers...

609
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:18,098
...to a group of Russian scientists
known to specialize and traffic...

610
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:20,851
...in biologicaI  weapons.

611
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:24,354
-She had nothing to do with it.
-Go home.

612
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:26,482
-She ain't--!
-That's an order.

613
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:47,794
How's it going?

614
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:49,296
Life is shit!

615
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,340
Yeah, well what can you do?

616
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:48,081
Through this door,
you are with us to the end.

617
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:51,585
-Are you sure that's what you want?
-I'm sure.

618
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,190
This is "Ahab". Think of it as
solar-powered submarine.

619
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,401
It can circumnavigate the globe
to reach its target.

620
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:44,490
It need only surface to gather sunshine
and to do its business.

621
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:47,576
What is it? What's its business?

622
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:53,081
Dropping off presents to all
the good Little boys and girls.

623
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:05,719
My team will be finished tomorrow.

624
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,304
How about you?

625
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:11,141
We're finished now.

626
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,049
Nikolai!

627
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,343
Bring the rockets.

628
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,466
The detonator is for you.

629
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,685
Yorgi! The binary agents are mixing...

630
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:20,938
...it will kill us all!

631
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:33,659
Looks Like little white mouse.

632
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:38,997
Bye-bye, little mouse.

633
01:15:56,723 --> 01:15:58,142
My God.

634
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:03,790
They did their job
and now they were Liability.

635
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:08,504
We don't need anyone
talking about our business.

636
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:18,514
The gas gets sucked through the
extractor fans, passed into water...

637
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,643
...and broken down to become,
once again, completely harmless.

638
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,357
So qulet.

639
01:17:31,276 --> 01:17:35,072
I know now why they call it
Silent Night.

640
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:45,207
Let's get some food.

641
01:18:20,492 --> 01:18:22,411
Find out what's going on!

642
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:57,905
What the hell was that?

643
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:06,079
That works.

644
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:34,585
Fire in the hole.

645
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:06,909
Sova. What are you doing here, man?

646
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:10,537
First you set me up in the bar.
Then you shoot me in the back.

647
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:14,374
My boss does it to me.
I did it to you. It's a vicious circle.

648
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,251
-You think it's funny?
-No.

649
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:19,129
You didn't take it personally,
did you?

650
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:23,008
I did what I had to do to get in.
We're on the same side.

651
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:26,094
I'm sorry. I switched sides.

652
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:31,058
You pushed me too far. My government
doesn't pay as well as Yorgi.

653
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:34,269
My government pays twice as much--

654
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:37,189
Think you could just walk
into the spy business...

655
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:42,528
-...and have all the angIes figured out?
-What are you going to do, shoot me?

656
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,738
Where? In the head, to be quick?

657
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:48,283
Or in the chest for an open casket,
so I can see your heart?

658
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,452
Can I think about it?

659
01:21:58,502 --> 01:21:59,837
What are you doing?!

660
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:03,924
I heard you talking. I could tell
where you were in the room.

661
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:08,095
What are you doing with the Ivans?

662
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:13,142
What's going on?

663
01:22:13,308 --> 01:22:16,812
There's something I didn't
have the time to tell you.

664
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,064
I'm an agent as well.

665
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:22,651
I'm an agent for FSB,
Russian Intelligence.

666
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,903
You know, like your CIA.

667
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:28,073
-I've been undercover for two years.
-Two years?

668
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,993
What was your plan,
Let them die of old age?

669
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,536
There was no plan.

670
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:37,291
A year ago, Intelligence gets
reorganized, I stop getting orders.

671
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:42,296
They forget about me. And I did what
I must to survive. You understand?

672
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:45,799
What do I understand?
I've been an agent for a week.

673
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:48,927
But my boss needs to know
what we know now.

674
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,889
-Okay?
-Okay.

675
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:57,102
The submarine's purpose is to deploy
a nerve agent called Silent Night.

676
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:00,522
It's been missing since
the Sovlet Union's collapse in '91.

677
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:02,024
It can kill millions.

678
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:05,277
We knew they were up to something.
You found out.

679
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:09,656
-That's excellent work, Triple X.
-There was never a sweeper team.

680
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,161
If I said don't jump off
the Empire State Building....

681
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:17,706
-You're right. I'd definitely do it.
-I inspired you.

682
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:21,376
I'm an authority figure,
that's what I'm supposed to do.

683
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:23,587
Look, my men are on this now.

684
01:23:23,754 --> 01:23:27,174
-"It's time for you to come home."
-What about Yelena?

685
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:33,597
I'm not authorized to give her asylum.

686
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:38,268
But I promise it'll be done
by the time you get here.

687
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:42,731
Come home, Xander. That's an order.

688
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:02,417
How soon can Yorgi Launch this thing?

689
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:09,466
You were told to go home!
Your people are handling--

690
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:11,593
How soon, Yelena?

691
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:16,723
Soon.
But it's not our problem  anymore!

692
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:19,810
If they get ahead of schedule,
it's everyone's.

693
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:24,314
He's got an army, a fortress.
You don't stand a chance!

694
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:29,278
I've risked my life for stupid reasons.
This is the first one that makes sense.

695
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:33,991
This is not one of your stunts.
You’ll die in this, you know that.

696
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:38,829
If you don't go back in there...

697
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:43,125
...he’ll know something's wrong.

698
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:47,045
You can't ask me to go back there.
You can't.

699
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:54,803
You want to know something ironic?
I volunteered for this assignment.

700
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,932
I wanted to make a difference.

701
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,685
I fought for it.

702
01:25:05,481 --> 01:25:06,773
Then finish it.

703
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,711
Remember what I told you,
after you kissed me?

704
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:30,714
-Never again?
-I Iied.

705
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:52,444
But when you break it down,
I'm a simpIe man.

706
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:54,780
I'd be happy with a beautiful
Czech girl--

707
01:25:54,988 --> 01:25:58,951
Hey, geek!
Got new orders from Gibbons. Get in.

708
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:07,292
-I want all that in here.
-Done.

709
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:10,879
The castle's covered
with surveillance cameras.

710
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:14,550
That's why we cannot get cIose enough.

711
01:26:16,927 --> 01:26:22,391
Hang on. That's why I need to
knock out the communications tower...

712
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:24,643
...at the base of the mountain.

713
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:33,443
Is there anyone here
who knows how to fly a plane?

714
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:36,071
I can.

715
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,956
Too much turbulence
around these mountains!

716
01:26:46,165 --> 01:26:48,792
Just get me in line with that tower!

717
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:50,544
I’ll do the rest!

718
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:05,309
Go now!

719
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:28,725
Viktor! We got company!

720
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:36,525
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

721
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:28,882
Nothing like fresh powder.

722
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:09,923
Yelena, my sweet dove,
did you get confused?

723
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:15,095
Your assignment was to kill the cop
after he killed X.

724
01:33:16,096 --> 01:33:20,517
Not good for undercover agent
from Russian Intelligence.

725
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:28,150
I knew about you all along...

726
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:33,447
...and it was my pleasure to twist
you and use you how I saw fit.

727
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:36,492
And you.

728
01:33:41,497 --> 01:33:44,333
Of all people,
I thought you'd understand...

729
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,877
...what I'm trying to accomplish.

730
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:49,338
Can you imagine?

731
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:53,133
Imagine a city Like Prague vanishing...

732
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:56,303
...in a cloud of poison gas.

733
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:59,807
Then Hamburg, London, Washington.

734
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:05,646
Imagine not knowing who did it, or why.
And so they turn on each other.

735
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:09,942
These guys attack those guys.
Those guys invade these guys.

736
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:13,070
Soon, whole world implodes.

737
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:16,448
Imagine governments disappearing.

738
01:34:16,615 --> 01:34:18,408
And in the end...

739
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:23,121
...imagine facing absolute,
beautiful freedom.

740
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:30,838
But neither of you will be there
to see it.

741
01:34:33,006 --> 01:34:35,008
Like Viktor.

742
01:34:37,928 --> 01:34:39,596
Like KoIya.

743
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:27,895
Cover me!

744
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:39,490
Get me out of this thing!

745
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:46,955
He took the hard drive.
He's going to launch "Ahab"!

746
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:54,797
Pick one.

747
01:36:05,474 --> 01:36:07,100
Ivan, take out that nest!

748
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:29,915
You have to turn the safety off.

749
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:56,108
Hold them off as long as you can.

750
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,778
See you, my friend.

751
01:37:56,418 --> 01:37:58,086
Come on, baby.

752
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:09,765
Stop! He's got us pinned down.

753
01:38:13,602 --> 01:38:15,103
Shit.

754
01:38:15,437 --> 01:38:17,022
You got a bazooka!

755
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:21,401
Stop thinking Prague police and start
thinking PlayStation. Blow shit up!

756
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:25,113
This is not bazooka.
This is heat-seeker rocket.

757
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:29,076
Heat-seeker?

758
01:38:30,536 --> 01:38:31,578
Set it.

759
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:38,585
The son of a bitch is smoking.

760
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:58,230
I told him that cigarette
would kill him one day.

761
01:39:59,249 --> 01:40:01,543
Learn how to shoot, piece of shit!

762
01:40:27,069 --> 01:40:29,488
Quick! Help me pull him out!

763
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:36,245
It will hit the city in 30 minutes!

764
01:40:50,884 --> 01:40:53,387
Guys. I need a helicopter.

765
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:56,431
I need transportation.
I need a--

766
01:41:03,522 --> 01:41:07,151
X, there you are.
I gave you everything you wanted.

767
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:09,486
This thing will damn near fly now.

768
01:41:09,653 --> 01:41:12,573
You screwed me.
Gibbons didn't authorize this.

769
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:14,575
He’ll hang us both out to dry.

770
01:41:14,741 --> 01:41:16,618
-Agent Shavers.
-Yeah?

771
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:19,663
I'm going to give you
a field promotion.

772
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:23,333
Take over, finish the mop-up.
You're in charge.

773
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:27,880
Yes, sir! I'm the man for the job!
I won't let you down!

774
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:30,757
Wait! Wait! Wait!

775
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:33,093
Almost forgot the manual.
You’re gonna need this.

776
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,929
Hey, X. Go kick some ass.

777
01:41:56,867 --> 01:42:00,954
That thing must be going 80 mph!
How do we stop it?!

778
01:42:01,163 --> 01:42:05,209
We can't! The controls
are on the bubble panel.

779
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:07,085
-You see it?
-Yeah.

780
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:09,505
The hard drive's in there!

781
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:14,009
You got the manual. See if Shavers
put in anything we could use.

782
01:42:14,176 --> 01:42:17,179
-He's got very bad handwriting.
-Come on!

783
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:22,810
Flame throwers, mini-bombs, exploding
hubcaps, rocket launchers!

784
01:42:23,393 --> 01:42:27,022
This is a tank.
You can't use any of it on "Ahab."

785
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:30,818
Silent Night only breaks down
in deep water.

786
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:33,821
-I’m gonna have to get on it!
-What?

787
01:42:35,322 --> 01:42:37,115
I’m gonna have to get on it.

788
01:42:44,331 --> 01:42:48,877
Our surveillance puts "Ahab"
22 minutes outside of Prague.

789
01:42:49,086 --> 01:42:53,799
-We should evacuate the city.
-22 minutes for 1.5 million people?

790
01:42:54,133 --> 01:42:57,761
Call air support. We may need
to blow it out of the water.

791
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:01,014
-If we hit that thing--
-This city will die.

792
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:03,308
And the crisis will be contained!

793
01:43:03,475 --> 01:43:05,227
One city's better than 10.

794
01:43:07,813 --> 01:43:11,358
Another thing: A blue GTO
is traveling parallel to "Ahab."

795
01:43:22,911 --> 01:43:25,747
Shit! Does this road
go back to the river?

796
01:43:26,123 --> 01:43:28,500
Come on! Check the GPS!

797
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:33,714
Yes, it does!
Fifteen miles at the town of Davle!

798
01:43:51,273 --> 01:43:54,276
There's got to be something here
we could use.

799
01:43:54,443 --> 01:43:58,489
Harpoon gun, parachutes
built into seats, ejectable roof.

800
01:43:58,655 --> 01:44:00,824
It's all useless!

801
01:44:02,284 --> 01:44:03,619
How far are we?

802
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:08,373
The river is just beyond
the next village.

803
01:44:17,508 --> 01:44:20,594
I'm going through!
Use the rocket launcher!

804
01:44:20,761 --> 01:44:22,429
-Twenty-two!
-Hit it!

805
01:44:26,016 --> 01:44:28,519
That was a flamethrower!
Use the rockets!

806
01:44:28,685 --> 01:44:31,897
It's 32! I told you!
I told you he had bad handwriting!

807
01:44:32,064 --> 01:44:33,232
Hit it!

808
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:11,520
Shavers loaded this thing.
We're missing something.

809
01:45:11,812 --> 01:45:14,690
There are more weapons
here on the back. Look.

810
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:29,329
-Take the wheel!
-What? You're crazy!

811
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:35,377
The brake! The brake!

812
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:39,590
The gas! The gas!

813
01:45:52,769 --> 01:45:54,229
X, what are you doing?

814
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:56,982
Five minutes to target.

815
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:04,531
X, talk to me!
What are you doing?

816
01:46:04,865 --> 01:46:07,868
-You said there was an ejectable roof.
-Right here!

817
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:09,077
Hit it!

818
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:25,761
Shit! It's out of range!

819
01:46:25,928 --> 01:46:29,389
-There's a bridge! Cross the bridge!
-Okay.

820
01:46:44,112 --> 01:46:45,197
Come on.

821
01:46:48,784 --> 01:46:49,868
Come on!

822
01:46:52,246 --> 01:46:54,623
-Got you!
-Yes!

823
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:59,294
-I wish I had a video camera!
-What you talking about?

824
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:01,964
This is gonna be one hell of a trick.

825
01:47:57,436 --> 01:47:59,104
Three minutes to target.

826
01:49:50,966 --> 01:49:52,593
One minute to target.

827
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:55,304
Move! Move! Move!

828
01:49:56,305 --> 01:49:57,764
Out of the way!

829
01:50:16,783 --> 01:50:18,035
Eyes!

830
01:50:34,968 --> 01:50:36,720
Ten seconds to target.

831
01:50:45,771 --> 01:50:47,272
Target in sight.

832
01:50:47,564 --> 01:50:51,485
Call the jets off.
Tell the jets to stand down!

833
01:51:04,373 --> 01:51:06,792
Welcome to the Xander zone!

834
01:51:47,124 --> 01:51:52,463
Zero contamination level. I understand, sir. Zero contamination level.

835
01:52:04,016 --> 01:52:05,142
You Yelena?

836
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,228
Mr. Gibbons.

837
01:52:09,062 --> 01:52:11,815
I promised Xander
you could go to America.

838
01:52:12,441 --> 01:52:14,234
I'm a man of my word.

839
01:52:14,401 --> 01:52:17,321
It doesn't make much difference now,
does it?

840
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:46,433
He's alive! He's alive! Come here!

841
01:52:53,607 --> 01:52:57,653
Get him out of there, double-time.
Go! Move!

842
01:52:59,863 --> 01:53:02,866
-Bora Bora!
-What? I can't hear you!

843
01:53:06,328 --> 01:53:07,913
Bora Bora.

844
01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:34,940
You're getting burnt.

845
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:42,447
Xander, you there?

846
01:53:43,073 --> 01:53:46,910
I know you're there, Xander. I've got
you here on satellite magnification.

847
01:53:51,331 --> 01:53:54,751
Call me. We got a whole
new thing to talk about.

848
01:53:55,878 --> 01:53:58,172
Something very important has come up.

849
01:53:59,131 --> 01:54:00,674
Oh, by the way...

850
01:54:01,091 --> 01:54:04,178
...you passed the test.
The Gibbons test.

851
01:54:07,181 --> 01:54:09,308
You gotta be kidding me.
