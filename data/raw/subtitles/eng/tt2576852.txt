12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:14,450
<i>Once upon a time
there lived a bamboo cutter.</i>

13
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:22,541
<i>On the mountain he would cut bamboo
to make all manner of things.</i>

14
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>Sanuki no Miyatsuko
was his name.</i>

15
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:37,765
<i>One day he saw light
shining from a bamboo stalk.</i>

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,649
<i>In wonder, he drew closer.</i>

17
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:57,034
A bamboo shoot growing
before the plums flower?

18
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,001
What's this?!

19
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,858
Um...

20
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,195
... may I ask who you might be?

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,104
What a beautiful princess!

22
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:12,526
Heaven must have sent her to me
as a blessing.

23
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,955
Did you catch something?

24
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,758
What a pretty doll!

25
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,135
No, she's sleeping.

26
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,804
What?!

27
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,936
I've been blessed.

28
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,187
"Blessed"?

29
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,523
By Heaven, in the grove!

30
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,237
It's <i>me</i> Heaven's blessed.

31
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,239
I'm the one who'll raise her.

32
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,159
"Raise her"? She's already
a beautiful princess.

33
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,204
There'll be more to this than you think.

34
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,747
Right?

35
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,088
Give her here!

36
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,232
Don't just sit there!
Bring me a cloth.

37
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,029
How's this?

38
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,035
There, there!

39
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,537
What's going on?

40
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,999
She wants me to raise her.

41
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,588
Get me a nice basket.

42
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,009
This is very strange, you know.

43
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,677
What if she's some kind of spirit?

44
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,637
What does she look like?

45
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,431
A baby.

46
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,390
Right!

47
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,851
But just now she was a princess!

48
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:57,024
That was Heaven telling us
who she'll grow into.

49
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:57,983
Really?

50
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,904
So that means
we must raise her properly.

51
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,073
Yes! That must be it.

52
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,449
Yes.

53
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,826
I see!

54
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,787
But who'll nurse her?

55
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,747
A wet nurse.

56
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,042
And the lathe-turners
have a new baby.

57
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,168
So this is...

58
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,379
A gift.

59
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,340
What's the matter?

60
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,732
What are you doing?!

61
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,279
There, there!
You must be hungry.

62
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,781
What?!

63
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,159
She's drinking it right down.

64
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,622
I've got milk!

65
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,817
She laughed!

66
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,153
She did!

67
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,406
Suddenly she feels heavier.

68
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,116
That can't be!

69
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,550
Now what?

70
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,801
She's heavier still!

71
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,845
Let me see.

72
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,599
She's growing really fast.

73
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,660
Plum blossoms already!

74
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,464
She just got heavier again!

75
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,049
You see?

76
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,885
Well, I'll be!

77
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,433
<i>From that day on
the Bamboo Cutter and his wife...</i>

78
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,895
<i>... would raise this miraculous child
as their very own.</i>

79
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,251
No! You can't have those yet.

80
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,176
There's a baby!

81
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,596
Yeah? Where?

82
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,015
Don't push!

83
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,516
There!

84
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,663
She looked at us!

85
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,456
Yeah!

86
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,832
No.

87
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,268
What is it?

88
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,327
Oh, my!

89
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,578
Well, I'll be!

90
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,475
Princess!

91
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,357
She's standing!

92
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,778
She's walking!

93
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,370
Oh, my!

94
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,261
There, there...

95
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,304
She's funny!

96
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,514
She walked.

97
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,765
She was just crawling.

98
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,434
She's growing fast!

99
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,061
Like a bamboo shoot!

100
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,938
That's her! Li'l Bamboo!

101
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,106
Li'l Bamboo!

102
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,441
Li'l Bamboo!

103
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,109
Li'l Bamboo!

104
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,277
Li'l Bamboo!

105
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,947
She's not "Li'l Bamboo"!
She's "Princess"!

106
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,782
Li'l Bamboo!

107
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,909
Li'l Bamboo!

108
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,786
Li'l Bamboo!

109
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,674
Princess!

110
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,926
Come to me!

111
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,304
Princess!

112
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,643
Li'l Bamboo!

113
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,020
Li'l Bamboo!

114
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,314
Princess!

115
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,316
Come to me!

116
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,401
Li'l Bamboo!

117
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,278
Li'l Bamboo!

118
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,822
Princess!

119
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,241
Princess!

120
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,621
Princess! Come to me!

121
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,498
Princess! Come to me!

122
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,707
Princess!

123
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,210
Come to me!

124
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,878
Do you want to come?

125
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,150
Bamboo shoots. That's supper.

126
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,863
Supper! Bamboo shoots!

127
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,700
Right!

128
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,827
Stand back.

129
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,460
There's lots!

130
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,129
Yeah!

131
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,494
Come here!

132
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,610
You don't mess with a wild pig!

133
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,072
Huh?

134
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,993
You're a strange kid.
You just got bigger.

135
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,163
She's weird, Sutemaru.

136
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,166
She's gotten bigger again!

137
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,669
Like a bamboo shoot.

138
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:01,920
A bamboo shoot?

139
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,672
Bamboo shoot! Supper!

140
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,007
Bamboo shoot!

141
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,009
Li'l Bamboo!

142
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,309
Round, round, go round

143
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:20,313
Waterwheel, go round

144
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:24,359
Go round, and call Mr Sun

145
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,196
Go round, and call Mr Sun

146
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,492
Birds, bugs, beasts

147
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,371
Grass, trees, flowers

148
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,333
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

149
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,379
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

150
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,505
Birds!

151
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,589
Bugs!

152
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,341
Beasts!

153
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,509
Grass!

154
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,385
Trees!

155
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,636
Flowers!

156
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,056
Huh?

157
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,142
Do you know this song?

158
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,518
Yes!

159
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,899
Go round, come round,
come round

160
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:09,446
Come round, O distant time

161
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:14,200
Come round,
call back my heart

162
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:19,706
Come round,
call back my heart

163
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:25,045
Birds, bugs, beasts

164
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:30,258
Grass, trees, flowers

165
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,847
Teach me how to feel

166
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,561
If I hear that you pine for me

167
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:49,235
I will return to you

168
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,574
That's a weird song.

169
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,367
She's crying!

170
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,702
Yeah!

171
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,163
What's wrong?

172
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,083
I don't know.

173
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,293
She's weird!

174
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,964
We live over there.

175
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,425
That's your bamboo grove.

176
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,680
Bamboo shoots!

177
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,975
Let's go!

178
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,108
Princess!

179
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,692
Princess!

180
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,779
Where are you?!

181
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,199
Princess! Princess!

182
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,506
What's that?

183
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,655
Could this be...?

184
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,325
See you later!

185
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,076
Be careful!

186
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,457
Should we be letting her
play with those boys?

187
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,210
She's fine with them.

188
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,422
It's just that
up in the grove I found...

189
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,550
No. It's nothing.

190
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,814
That's lacquer. You'll get a rash!

191
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,274
"Lacquer"?

192
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,156
That smells good!

193
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,909
We'll make bowls from them.

194
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,327
From these?

195
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,749
Wow!

196
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,919
That's my dad, my elder brother,
and my mom.

197
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,309
Goodbye!

198
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,730
Bring us something back!

199
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,941
The Bamboo Cutter's girl.

200
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:17,986
"Li'l Bamboo".

201
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,079
Come on, Li'l Bamboo!

202
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,683
It's so hot!

203
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,185
I'm thirsty.

204
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,453
I'll bet those are good.

205
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,912
Yeah?

206
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,914
Don't!

207
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,551
Come on!

208
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,012
Someone's coming!

209
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,277
Leave it!

210
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,428
This is for the others.

211
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,988
This is good!

212
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,823
This is good!

213
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:46,819
When these beautiful clothes
came flying up, I knew...

214
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,155
... what Heaven wants.

215
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,866
What Heaven wants?

216
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:58,456
It wants us to give her a life
that suits these robes.

217
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,042
To make her a noble princess.

218
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,836
A noble princess?

219
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,426
With this gold, I'll build her
a fine mansion in the capital.

220
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,226
Take her there?

221
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,185
Yes.

222
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,396
Out here she'll always be
just a country girl.

223
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,194
Living with nobles
as a real princess...

224
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,238
... she'll be happy.

225
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:33,950
In any case,
that is Heaven's wish.

226
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,410
A noble princess...

227
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,828
Yes.

228
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:41,249
Anyway, tomorrow I'll go
to the capital.

229
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,486
<i>From the next day on,
the Bamboo Cutter...</i>

230
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,240
<i>... went often to the capital,
with gold in his kimono.</i>

231
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:24,083
<i>The summer went by,
and the autumn harvest came round.</i>

232
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,548
Blow, O wind, blow, blow

233
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,802
Blow hard, O wind

234
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,306
Li'l Bamboo! Take him!

235
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,643
Bring the fruits of the mountains

236
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:50,484
Chestnuts, mushrooms, grapes...

237
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,987
Carry me!

238
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,286
Carry me!

239
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,677
I'll rub it all over you!

240
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,974
A pheasant!

241
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,436
It's heading for you!

242
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,897
Li'l Bamboo! Chase it left!

243
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,148
Okay!

244
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,037
It's coming your way!

245
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,047
I'll get you!

246
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,892
Sutemaru!

247
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,394
Sutemaru!

248
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,897
Sutemaru!

249
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,028
Sutemaru!

250
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,703
I got it.

251
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,538
I got it!

252
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,165
Great!

253
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:29,917
Are you hurt?

254
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,419
I'm coming down.

255
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,214
No!

256
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,976
Sutemaru!

257
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,979
The rocks are weak here!

258
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,774
I'm sorry.

259
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,110
Get a long vine, will you!

260
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,486
Sure!

261
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,198
You're bleeding.

262
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,659
A little spit'll fix that.

263
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,411
No!

264
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,955
Wait.

265
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,762
There.

266
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,308
Li'l Bamboo...

267
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,186
... did you get bigger again?

268
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,772
You think so?

269
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:38,027
Somehow I have the feeling
you'll just keep on growing...

270
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,614
... and go somewhere far away.

271
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,993
Why do you say that?

272
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,456
I'll always be here with you,
forever and ever.

273
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,417
I'll always be one of your gang.

274
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,085
Sutemaru!

275
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,504
How's this?

276
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,297
Good.

277
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,595
Tie it!

278
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,679
We did!

279
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,806
Right!

280
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,143
Go on.

281
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,067
Hey, there's mushrooms here!

282
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,194
Look, Sutemaru!

283
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,695
You're right!

284
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,825
Look at them all!
Tomorrow let's have a stew!

285
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,327
Yeah! We'll cook this bird.

286
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,329
Great! Pheasant stew!

287
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,167
Pheasant! Pheasant! Pheasant stew!

288
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,015
Sorry I'm late.

289
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,352
Sutemaru caught a pheasant.

290
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,896
And we found mushrooms and grapes!

291
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,110
Where are you going?

292
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,444
The capital.

293
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,904
The capital?

294
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,407
Me, too?

295
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,409
Now?

296
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,078
Yes. Leave that basket there.

297
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:15,708
But I told Sutemaru
we'd all have pheasant stew.

298
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,251
Leave it.

299
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,551
Let's go.

300
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,450
Will we be back in time
for stew tomorrow?

301
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,749
<i>But for the Princess and Sutemaru,
that tomorrow never came.</i>

302
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,499
The young miss is awake.

303
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,506
Good morning.

304
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,200
If you please...

305
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,242
Well, well, well!

306
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,663
I trust Your Highest is in
the bestest of spirits this finest...

307
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,707
... of mornings?

308
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,794
Momma?

309
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,343
Poppa? Is that you?

310
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,772
You scared me!

311
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,608
Why are you dressed like that?

312
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,693
It doesn't suit us, does it.

313
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,944
Now, now!

314
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:36,575
Get yourself a range of chobe,
I mean, "a change of robe"!

315
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,119
In there.

316
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,837
All those robes are yours,
Your Highness.

317
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,637
They smell so nice!

318
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,645
They're beautiful!

319
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,485
Like a rainbow!

320
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,743
I'm glad she likes them.

321
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,245
I told you!

322
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,665
You're going to live here now.

323
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,837
In this mansion?!

324
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,338
Yes.

325
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,682
Wow!

326
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,629
Poppa, can I swim in there?

327
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,302
You most certainly may not.

328
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,768
A noble princess does not frolic
and dance around in such a manner.

329
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,396
Your Highness...

330
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:35,569
... I've summoned Lady Sagami
from the palace to teach you...

331
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,572
... the ways of a noble princess.

332
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,574
A "noble princess"?

333
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,743
"Palace"?

334
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:50,417
I have never met a child
so much in need of my instruction.

335
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:57,674
I will undertake to make her
a truly fine lady.

336
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,221
<i>And so with Lady Sagami...</i>

337
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:06,767
<i>... the princess began to learn
the noble airs and graces of a lady.</i>

338
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,102
Watch carefully.

339
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:14,566
One holds one's back straight,
and stands with a "swish".

340
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,444
"Swish"?

341
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,782
That will do for now.

342
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,453
In any event, a noble lady stands
only on rare occasions.

343
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,791
Then how do I move
to pick something up?

344
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,750
In that case...

345
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,626
... thus!

346
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,130
One proceeds on one's knees,
and <i>always</i> gracefully.

347
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,096
Be graceful at all times...

348
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,977
Your Highness!

349
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,317
Beautiful, is it not?

350
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:01,989
Unroll it like this, and the story
flows out in the pictures.

351
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,661
Yeah! It really flows!

352
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,924
Let us have a short rest.

353
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:25,512
Your enthusiasm
for practicing handwriting...

354
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,515
... makes me proud.

355
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,941
Your Highness!

356
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,784
Once more, together.

357
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,875
Hey, this is fun!

358
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,543
Your Highness!

359
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,337
Well?

360
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,715
How's the koto practice going?

361
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,717
Sir!

362
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,560
I trust you are well, Father.

363
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,062
Well, well, well!

364
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,194
You're so elegant
I hardly recognized you.

365
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,403
Whoops!

366
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,157
And how is the koto lesson going?

367
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:31,370
We've only just begun...

368
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,385
Well, well, well!

369
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:58,772
With me, she treats everything
as if it were a game.

370
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,734
But then instantly
she does everything perfectly.

371
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,778
That makes sense.

372
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,781
She is truly a princess from Heaven.

373
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,952
She is not one to stay forever
out in the mountains.

374
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:20,252
<i>Thus the princess seemed devoted
to making a noble lady of herself.</i>

375
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,280
Whoops!

376
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,491
What's going on here?!

377
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,453
Will you stop doing all this!

378
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:58,123
You are now the mother
of a noble princess.

379
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,334
But this makes me feel at home.

380
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,338
It's because of you
the princess won't...

381
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,052
Is something the matter?

382
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,514
You're very quiet.

383
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,683
Well, Husband...

384
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,694
Is that true?

385
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,029
Yes.

386
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:33,533
That's wonderful!
We'll have to hold a banquet!

387
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,784
A banquet?

388
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,120
To mark your coming of age.

389
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,332
This is the happiest of occasions!

390
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:43,126
So we can invite my friends?

391
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,713
I miss them so much!

392
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,884
That might be nice.

393
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,552
Don't be a fool!

394
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:56,056
Do you realize
how important this is?!

395
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:01,728
We live in a different world
to those hillbillies!

396
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,524
We'll have the naming ceremony
after New Year's.

397
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,904
After your coming-out banquet
you'll be a true princess!

398
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,323
Poppa...

399
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,576
This is wonderful!

400
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,914
I know! I'll ask Inbe no Akita
to be your "Name Father".

401
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,627
Is anyone here?!

402
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,214
Lady Sagami? Lady Sagami!

403
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,761
What a bore.

404
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:18,471
Birds, bugs, beasts

405
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,810
Grass, trees, flowers...

406
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,149
Momma, can I use
this piece of the garden?

407
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:29,983
Sorry?

408
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,944
To plant things I like.

409
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,655
Why, of course you can.

410
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,241
Do what you like with it.

411
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,493
Thanks, Momma.

412
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,643
No! Never!

413
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,817
You'll never be a fine princess
looking like that.

414
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,362
I'll get sweat in my eyes
if you pluck my eyebrows!

415
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,658
A noble princess does not sweat.

416
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:20,659
Now...

417
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,536
And blackened teeth
just look weird!

418
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,705
How will I laugh?

419
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,043
A noble princess does not
open her mouth and laugh.

420
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,378
That's stupid!

421
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:36,216
Even a princess must sweat
and laugh out loud sometimes!

422
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,218
Or want to cry.

423
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,136
Or get mad and shout!

424
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,389
No. A noble princess...

425
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,892
Then a noble princess isn't human!

426
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,565
Your Highness!

427
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,652
The poor thing was tied up!

428
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,074
Your Highness!

429
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,579
This way, Lord Akita.

430
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,486
Your Highness!

431
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,245
I'm very sorry!
She's still very young.

432
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,955
Not at all.

433
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,417
She's an adorable little princess.

434
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,925
She has yet to be made up.
I am truly ashamed.

435
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,762
Don't give it a second thought.

436
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,765
To observe her as she really is...

437
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,478
... will help me think of
an appropriate name.

438
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,271
I am glad to hear that.

439
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,151
Please bestow a fine name
on our princess.

440
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,323
Your Highness,
come and greet Lord Akita.

441
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,019
How do you do, sir.

442
00:46:54,646 --> 00:47:00,693
Your Highness, let Lord Akita
hear you play on the koto.

443
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,390
Beautiful!

444
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,729
"The Shining Princess
of the Supple Bamboo"...

445
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,899
"The Princess...

446
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,693
"Kaguya"?

447
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:42,902
Yes.

448
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,739
A form as graceful
as slender bamboo...

449
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,909
... and a beauty
that shines out from her.

450
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:54,330
I give her a name
that means "shining light".

451
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:58,084
I thus suggest "Princess Kaguya".

452
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,086
"Princess Kaguya"!

453
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,758
Lord Akita, you have given her
a truly fine name.

454
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,094
Thank you very much.

455
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:55,266
<i>Following the rites of hair
and trailing skirt...</i>

456
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,478
<i>... guests were invited
in great numbers...</i>

457
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:03,483
<i>... to a banquet celebrating
the taking of her name.</i>

458
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,746
Congratulations!

459
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,500
"Princess Kaguya"
certainly is a fine name.

460
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,027
There are so many
fine gentlemen here!

461
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:53,366
This is a banquet to celebrate
the taking of my name?

462
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,535
Yes, it is.

463
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,372
But all I'm doing is sitting.

464
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,668
I may as well
not even be here.

465
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,737
Thank you very much!

466
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:36,576
<i>Princess Kaguya's naming banquet
went on for three days and nights.</i>

467
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:42,373
To Princess Kaguya having
her hair put up!

468
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,375
'Tis a fine thing!

469
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,504
A fine thing! A fine thing!

470
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:01,601
But isn't this all
a bit pretentious?

471
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,270
Your "princess".

472
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,857
Princess Kaguya, or whoever it is...

473
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,235
... enshrined behind
that bamboo blind.

474
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,782
What's wrong with us seeing
if she's as beautiful as they say?

475
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:19,952
No! Anything but that!

476
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:24,916
So we come to celebrate
and we can't even say hello?

477
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,376
That's the custom!

478
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,630
The custom for noble women,
not commoners.

479
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:31,547
Hey!

480
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,383
She's not a real princess.

481
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,303
She <i>is</i> a princess!

482
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,809
What did it cost
to get her named one?

483
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,645
At least let us see her!

484
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,314
Maybe she's ugly!

485
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,816
What a farce!

486
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,199
Um...

487
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:50,663
... would you know what happened to
the people who lived down below?

488
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:54,208
I wouldn't know.

489
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:59,380
They're on a journey
looking for good trees.

490
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,715
A journey?

491
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,050
They won't be back for ten years.

492
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,885
Ten years?

493
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:09,056
Use up all the trees
and you kill the mountain.

494
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:14,061
Leave its power and go away,
and it revives.

495
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,607
Give the trees ten years,
and you can work them again.

496
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,235
Charcoal's like that, too.

497
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:27,074
But what if the mountain
really is dead?

498
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,244
The leaves were so beautiful...

499
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:37,084
It's not dead.

500
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,549
Look.

501
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:48,095
The trees are getting ready
for spring.

502
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,599
They are?

503
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,934
Will spring come back here?

504
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,770
Sure it will.

505
00:55:55,895 --> 00:56:01,942
Now the trees are waiting
for it to come round again.

506
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,278
But who...

507
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:36,143
I've seen this before.

508
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:32,426
<i>From that day on,
Princess Kaguya...</i>

509
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:37,598
<i>... was like a different person,
devoting herself to her studies...</i>

510
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:41,435
<i>... in pensive silence.</i>

511
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,772
Your Highness!

512
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,323
Look at all these gifts!

513
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:58,786
The nobility has accepted you
as one of them!

514
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:02,456
This is the proof!

515
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,800
For old times' sake...

516
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:18,973
... I'll weave you a fine bamboo cage
for this meadow bunting.

517
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,977
Thank you, Father.

518
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,152
Thanks be to Heaven!

519
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,656
Thanks be to Heaven!

520
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,659
I'll just leave this here.

521
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,702
<i>As word of this great beauty spread...</i>

522
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,372
<i>... huge crowds gathered
outside the mansion...</i>

523
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,376
<i>... hoping to catch a glimpse of
Princess Kaguya.</i>

524
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,511
Do you serve Princess Kaguya?

525
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,389
Then give her this!

526
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,058
Please!

527
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,559
And this!

528
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,779
There's another crowd
of gentlemen outside.

529
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:03,744
They've given me
all these letters for you.

530
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,748
And I brought you
some cherry blossoms...

531
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:11,919
... because you can't go out
with that crowd outside.

532
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,588
Thank you!

533
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:48,288
You summoned me,
Prince Ishitsukuri?

534
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,629
About that rich upstart's daughter
that you named...

535
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,424
You mean Princess Kaguya?

536
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,134
Keep your voice down!

537
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,469
Did you say "Princess Kaguya"?

538
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,974
Princess Kaguya?
I've heard the gossip about her.

539
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,351
They say she's very beautiful.

540
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:12,187
You would shout, wouldn't you.

541
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,983
Beautiful she may be,
but she is of humble birth.

542
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,153
She is not a woman
for any of us.

543
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:24,491
"Princess Kaguya" is
a presumptuous name...

544
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,745
... for a daughter of
the likes of Miyatsuko.

545
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,621
No, Minister.

546
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:33,834
She is not his true daughter.

547
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,336
She was born from a bamboo stalk.

548
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,963
A bamboo stalk?

549
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,717
How interesting.
So she's a woodland spirit?

550
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:46,263
That is not entirely impossible,
Lord Counselor.

551
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,514
What?!

552
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,810
The moment I stood before her...

553
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,689
... this aged body began to tremble...

554
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:59,359
... as if a dry fountain
had come back to life.

555
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:05,032
Just the memory of
that glimmering beauty...

556
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:09,953
... leaves me completely lost for words!

557
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,506
Stand aside!

558
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,725
I will win this race!

559
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,144
I will be first!

560
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,523
That glimmering beauty will be mine!

561
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,900
I will have her!

562
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,069
I go to meet my wife!

563
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,623
Lady Sagami! Lady Sagami!

564
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:56,458
What is it?

565
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,418
Look at these!

566
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:02,548
Five of the land's highest-born men
have come...

567
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,758
... and in formal dress!

568
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:05,884
Oh, my!

569
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,595
Thanks be to Heaven!

570
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,265
A minister, two princes...

571
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:15,435
But how will we choose among them?

572
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:20,107
They're all here together,
awaiting an answer.

573
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:23,277
I understand.
Leave the princess to me.

574
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,946
You go entertain them.

575
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,281
I will!

576
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:30,075
Thank you very much!

577
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,996
Thanks be to Heaven!

578
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,624
That banquet was worth
every penny I spent on it!

579
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,753
They are all of the highest rank.

580
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:45,132
You will not go wrong
with any of them.

581
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:48,802
So, Your Highness,
choose the one you wish.

582
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:51,138
Even though I don't know them?

583
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,556
Of course.

584
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:58,979
A gentleman makes a proposal,
and you meet on your wedding day.

585
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:03,525
With your choice
of these five nobles...

586
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,778
... how happy you will be!

587
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,822
"Happy"?

588
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,660
I have no wish
to marry anyone yet.

589
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,329
You can't mean that!

590
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:20,292
You must marry a suitable gentleman
as soon as possible.

591
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:23,003
That is happiness itself.

592
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,838
Why would you hesitate?

593
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:29,009
With any of those men,
your happiness is assured.

594
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:31,136
I will not choose any of them!

595
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,513
Please ask them to leave.

596
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:39,353
Do you wish to hurt your father?

597
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:44,483
He is as glad for you
as he would be for himself.

598
01:05:55,994 --> 01:06:01,041
All has been made ready.
If you would come this way...

599
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:30,070
Now, if you would each speak
in order of precedence.

600
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:35,075
I am Prince Kuramochi.

601
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,576
Princess...

602
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:43,583
... my feelings toward you are
as I wrote in my letter.

603
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:50,590
If it came to pass
that you became my wife...

604
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:55,762
... my joy would be as if I had found
a jeweled branch from a tree...

605
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,098
... of Mount Horai in China...

606
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,435
... with silver roots, gold trunk,
and pearls for fruit.

607
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:07,274
To me, you are a treasure
as unattainable as that.

608
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,275
If you would...

609
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,612
I am Prince Ishitsukuri.
If you consent to be my wife...

610
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:16,950
... I will worship you day and night,
my forehead to the ground...

611
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:21,955
... as I would the stone begging bowl
of Lord Buddha himself in India.

612
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,625
You would treat her
as a piece of cold stone?

613
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:29,921
To me you are
as a robe of fire-rat fur.

614
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:33,759
Put in the flames,
all impurities burn away...

615
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,803
... but it is not consumed,
and merely glistens...

616
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,014
... all the brighter.

617
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:45,645
You are as pure
as this rare treasure of China.

618
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:49,983
You compare Princess Kaguya
to a rat-skin?

619
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,319
To me, Princess...

620
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:56,656
... you are a jewel
that glistens more radiantly...

621
01:07:56,782 --> 01:08:01,787
... than the five-colored stone
that shines from the dragon's neck!

622
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:02,829
No, no, no!

623
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,998
To me, Princess Kaguya...

624
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:10,504
... is like the cowry shell
the swallow warms as a treasure...

625
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:15,092
... and a charm for safe birth.

626
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:16,343
"A treasure"...

627
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:20,847
A cowry shell is a treasure?
It is to laugh!

628
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,559
Well, a dragon's neck stinks!

629
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:26,686
It's the jewel <i>on</i> the neck!

630
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:53,380
What a beautiful melody!

631
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:59,052
I am grateful for these sentiments
toward someone...

632
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:02,722
... you have neither met nor seen.

633
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:04,850
I ask...

634
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,896
... that you bring me...

635
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,358
... these rare treasures
of which you speak.

636
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:19,906
Then I will be able
to feel clearly in my heart...

637
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,742
... how you treasure me.

638
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:28,415
Prince Kuramochi, bring me
the jeweled branch of Horai.

639
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,419
Prince Ishitsukuri,
Lord Buddha's stone bowl.

640
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:33,587
But... but...

641
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:38,258
Lord Minister of the Right Abe,
bring a robe of fire-rat fur.

642
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,301
What?!

643
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:44,431
Grand Counselor Otomo,
the jewel from the dragon's neck.

644
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:51,271
And Middle Counselor Isonokami,
the swallow's cowry shell.

645
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,606
Impossible!

646
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,274
No, no no no...

647
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:57,777
These things may not even exist!

648
01:09:57,903 --> 01:10:01,323
They were only figures of speech!

649
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:02,782
Yes.

650
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:08,455
You have all compared me
to very rare treasures.

651
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:12,751
If I can obtain one of them...

652
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:17,797
... I will happily become
that gentleman's "treasure".

653
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,968
Gentlemen, I apologize!

654
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,763
She knows nothing of the world.

655
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:28,975
But she must be beautiful.
Her voice, her music...

656
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,896
Indeed! That melody was
quite out of this world.

657
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,983
But to set us
these impossible tasks...

658
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,319
Out of the question!

659
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:42,697
She is truly
an unattainable treasure.

660
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,664
It's terrible!

661
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:55,168
When the nobles left,
so did everyone else outside!

662
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:58,171
Just like the tide going out?

663
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,506
Yes.

664
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,549
I thought I should tell you.

665
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:05,553
Your Highness!

666
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,351
Let's go!

667
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,686
Where?

668
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:13,687
Out!

669
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:14,771
Out?

670
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,815
To see the cherry blossoms!

671
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,860
Go ask Father and Mother
to come, too!

672
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,490
There is nothing more I can do.

673
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,826
Yes, but surely...

674
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,996
Next time the princess will...

675
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:33,999
There will be no next time.

676
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:38,503
I will take my leave of you.

677
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,672
But...

678
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:48,305
The carriage the princess requested
awaits, Squire.

679
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:51,308
Tell them to go on ahead!

680
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,076
Oh, my!

681
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,252
It's beautiful!

682
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:05,548
Stop!

683
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,347
Your Highness?

684
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,286
How wonderful!

685
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,334
I'm very sorry, Milady.

686
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,174
Please forgive us!

687
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,181
Come on.

688
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,864
They're right at their peak.

689
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:56,117
Yes, they're beautiful.

690
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,542
Let's go home.

691
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,930
Something's happened up ahead.

692
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,598
Someone's coming.

693
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:01,766
Sutemaru!

694
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:02,600
Run!

695
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:03,518
Sutemaru?

696
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,613
Sutemaru!

697
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,491
Sutemaru!

698
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:32,797
What's wrong?!

699
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,507
They'll catch us!

700
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:37,802
We're going!

701
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,149
Li'l Bamboo!

702
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,002
Sutemaru!

703
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:13,838
Sutemaru!

704
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,673
Sutemaru!

705
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,018
Come on.

706
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:04,555
<i>Three years went by.</i>

707
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,101
Off you go.

708
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:06,951
Isn't it a lovely day.
Look how the garden has grown.

709
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,287
Yes, but you know...

710
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:14,459
... it all looks different
when you see it from here.

711
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,259
Well!

712
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,141
It's like the mountain back home.

713
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,267
You're right.

714
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,979
There's the forest, and the hill...

715
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,315
And there's our house.

716
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,485
And the grass is the bamboo grove.

717
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,987
The mugwort looks just like trees.

718
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:47,158
You can almost see the moon
rising behind the mountain.

719
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,787
And we could go over the bridge
and up the hill...

720
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,330
Princess!

721
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:55,166
Where is Her Highness?

722
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,168
You're here again?

723
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,836
What's wrong with it?

724
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,630
You're here all the time!

725
01:20:00,797 --> 01:20:02,673
Anyway, not now.

726
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,342
The Prince!

727
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:08,763
Prince Kuramochi has brought
the jeweled branch of Horai!

728
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,765
Impossible!

729
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:14,018
It's hard to believe,
but he's true to his word.

730
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:18,022
You'd think he'd be angry
with a task like that...

731
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:22,860
... but he really has brought back
a jeweled branch!

732
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:28,032
Your Highness, go and get ready
for your wedding!

733
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,700
I should hurry!

734
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:33,204
The two of them will need
a bedchamber!

735
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:39,168
If only Lady Sagami were here!

736
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,463
This can't be right!

737
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,882
A bedchamber...

738
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,595
Princess Kaguya!

739
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:52,056
Where is Princess Kaguya?

740
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:54,642
Please wait, Your Highness!

741
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,105
Squire Miyatsuko!

742
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,399
Forgive me.

743
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:06,904
I was in such a rush to get here
I didn't change my clothes.

744
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:11,325
Oh, this is wonderful!
Thanks be to Heaven!

745
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,578
Please... this way.

746
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,915
Come in.

747
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:39,270
Without further ado,
I will show what I promised to bring.

748
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,626
It's so beautiful it dazzles the eye!

749
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:06,297
As you wished,
the jeweled branch of Horai.

750
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,551
Princess Kaguya,
are you in there?

751
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,472
Come near and take a good look.

752
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,140
One moment.

753
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:22,813
First, allow me to ask
how you came by it.

754
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,483
Of course!

755
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:46,462
Three years ago
I vowed to carry out your wish.

756
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,506
I boarded a ship...

757
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:52,677
... and we set course
for Mount Horai.

758
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,513
Tossed by angry waves...

759
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:58,516
... and starving for lack of food...

760
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:02,520
... after all manner of
trials and tribulations...

761
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,022
... "Behold!

762
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:10,695
"What is that mountain,
so beautiful yet forbidding?

763
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,698
"Amazing!

764
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:17,702
"It flows with water of gold,
silver, and lapis lazuli!

765
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,203
"Look!

766
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:23,040
"A celestial maiden scoops water
with a silver bowl!

767
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,292
"Hello!

768
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,546
"What is the name
of this mountain?"

769
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:33,050
"This is Mount Horai.

770
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:37,388
"And my name is Ukanruri."

771
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:43,561
At last I had made my way
to Mount Horai!

772
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,567
Without a second glance at the maiden,
I climbed the mountain.

773
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:54,071
"Look at those beautiful trees!

774
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:59,910
"Silver branches, trunks of gold,
and fruit of pearls!

775
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:02,580
"How beautiful!

776
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:07,251
"Are these not
the jeweled branches of Horai...

777
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,421
"... Princess Kaguya said
she wished for?"

778
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:16,761
This is the branch
I snapped off then.

779
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,104
One look is worth a hundred tales.

780
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,608
Look upon it with your own eyes.

781
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:40,284
No! You can't do this!

782
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,620
Get out of my way!

783
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,290
What is the meaning of this?

784
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:49,627
I most humbly apologize.
I'll go see.

785
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,134
At least read this letter!

786
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,552
What's going on?

787
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:03,307
Pay us our fee for
the jeweled branch we made!

788
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:04,475
What?!

789
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:06,644
"Made"?

790
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:13,818
I am Ayabe no Uchimaro,
of the Guild of Artisans.

791
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:19,740
Prince Kuramochi had us
mount gems...

792
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,202
... and fashion them into
a jeweled branch.

793
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:24,662
What?

794
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:28,165
The Prince, however,
has not yet paid us.

795
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,583
He hasn't?

796
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,585
Oh, dear!

797
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:36,006
And since Princess Kaguya,
one of his concubines...

798
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:40,845
... sorry, his <i>wife,</i>
was here in this house...

799
01:25:41,137 --> 01:25:43,639
... we had no choice...

800
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:48,185
... but to come here
and ask her for payment.

801
01:25:52,148 --> 01:25:53,858
I see.

802
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,027
Your Highness, what is the...

803
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,532
Your Highness?
Where did he go?!

804
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,034
Where's the branch?

805
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,204
His Highness has taken his leave.

806
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,706
What?!

807
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:20,551
Please reward the artisans
very well.

808
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:26,724
There!

809
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:33,564
<i>Next to call at the mansion
was Abe, Minister of the Right.</i>

810
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,409
Look!

811
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,370
See how it glistens!

812
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:56,587
The world has never seen
such an expensive engagement gift.

813
01:26:57,046 --> 01:27:00,841
But if it should please
Princess Kaguya...

814
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,011
... it is a mere trifle.

815
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:06,764
In that case...

816
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:09,266
Ah, you're right here?

817
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,143
Put it into a fire.

818
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,102
Huh?

819
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,772
What?

820
01:27:16,065 --> 01:27:18,776
If it is truly the fur
of the fire-rat...

821
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:23,781
... it will not burn,
but merely glisten all the brighter.

822
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,616
Of course!

823
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:29,119
This robe is the genuine article!

824
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,956
Placed in the fire, it will not burn.

825
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,793
Or at least, it "should not" burn.

826
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:40,047
Unless of course between myself
and the princess...

827
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:44,635
... there remains
some unwarranted impurity.

828
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,470
Yes, indeed.

829
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,640
All the more reason to test it.

830
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:54,436
Burn away all the impurity
of my doubts.

831
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,441
Oh, all right!

832
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,359
What did I tell you?

833
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:43,861
You see?

834
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,039
Ow!

835
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:01,879
My fortune is burning!

836
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:15,559
I've lost everything!

837
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:27,071
Do you realize how much this cost?!

838
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:30,240
Look at it, will you!

839
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:33,243
"Burn it," she says!

840
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:37,581
How infuriating!

841
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:51,095
I wonder how much
the Minister spent on that fake.

842
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:54,640
I assume that is what I am
to those gentlemen.

843
01:29:55,557 --> 01:30:00,104
A fake jeweled branch,
or a rat-fur robe that burns.

844
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,109
Both those objects
were very expensive.

845
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,778
But don't worry.

846
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:11,865
Grand Counselor Otomo
has indeed put to sea...

847
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,537
... in quest of the gem
hanging from the dragon's neck.

848
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:21,792
They say in order to marry you...

849
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,294
... he has sent his wife away...

850
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,798
... and completely rebuilt his mansion.

851
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,302
A warrior's resolve
is a wondrous thing.

852
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,685
All right, Dragon! Have at me!

853
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,024
Careful!

854
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,550
The Dragon!

855
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:16,054
Forgive me! Forgive me!

856
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:30,235
Another one!

857
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:33,655
Help me!

858
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:37,409
Calm down!
The storm will blow itself out.

859
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:54,051
<i>About that time, Prince Ishitsukuri
was paying a call on Princess Kaguya.</i>

860
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:20,035
Well, Your Highness,
is this Lord Buddha's stone bowl?

861
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:22,454
Give this to her.

862
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:25,123
What is it exactly?

863
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:27,292
Give it to her, please.

864
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:30,462
Yes, but...

865
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:40,806
Your Highness,
this is from Prince Ishitsukuri.

866
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,825
Since I first heard your voice
three years ago...

867
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,953
... you have been constantly
on my mind.

868
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:08,166
Desperately I searched for
"Buddha's stone begging bowl".

869
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:13,338
I crossed meadow and mountain,
visiting every temple in the land.

870
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:18,844
Eventually, weary as could be,
I sat on a rock by the roadside.

871
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:25,684
Suddenly my eye fell upon
a wildflower there at my feet.

872
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:31,857
Ah! My feelings for you
bloomed unknown, I thought...

873
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:34,693
... just like that flower.

874
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:40,198
Suddenly the realization dawned...

875
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:43,869
... that what I wanted to give you...

876
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:47,539
... and you wanted to receive...

877
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:52,044
... was not some unattainable treasure,
but that flower.

878
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:57,382
In other words,
the symbol of my devotion to you.

879
01:33:58,175 --> 01:33:59,551
"Devotion"...

880
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,805
Princess Kaguya!
You are the one...

881
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:07,392
... to whom I would give my heart.

882
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:11,897
Would you accept
that lovely flower...

883
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:14,232
... and my devotion?

884
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:20,405
I have always loved plants.

885
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:26,244
I am entranced by the nameless flowers
that grow by the roadside.

886
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,581
And I always wish...

887
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:33,877
... I could live as one of those
flowers of the field.

888
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:45,263
Princess, come with me
to some place that is not this one.

889
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:49,643
Let us leave the capital
and its formalities...

890
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:54,940
... for a rich green land of flowers,
birds, and leaping fish.

891
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:57,275
Somewhere not here.

892
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:04,449
We will laugh, sing, and sleep
to our hearts' content.

893
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:08,620
Morning to night,
the seasons meeting our needs...

894
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:11,790
... let us spin a beautiful tale.

895
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:17,796
Come with me
to somewhere that is not here!

896
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:24,302
A land of green where flowers bloom,
birds sing, and fish dance!

897
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:26,972
Somewhere that is not here!

898
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:39,651
What?!

899
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:44,156
"Somewhere that is not here"?

900
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:49,077
I would very much like
to be taken there again.

901
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,329
I'm sorry!

902
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,498
Forgive me!

903
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:59,838
How many flowers...

904
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:05,010
... have you plucked
and thrown away...

905
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:09,139
... leaving them
to shave their heads in despair...

906
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,684
... and become nuns?

907
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,857
I've found one!

908
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,526
Get me down!

909
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,986
<i>Remaining now...</i>

910
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:28,700
<i>... was Middle Counselor Isonokami,
and the swallow's cowry shell.</i>

911
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:32,996
Counselor!

912
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:43,089
He's dead?!

913
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:44,049
Yes.

914
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:48,720
The fall broke
the Middle Counselor's back.

915
01:37:14,371 --> 01:37:15,831
What's wrong?

916
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:19,835
This garden! It's a fake!

917
01:37:21,837 --> 01:37:22,629
Fake!

918
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,422
Fake!

919
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:25,757
Fake!

920
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:27,592
Fake!

921
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,261
All of it! Fake!

922
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:32,430
And so am I!

923
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:33,807
Stop it.

924
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:45,944
It's my fault everyone's miserable.

925
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:50,115
It's not your fault. It's not.

926
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:53,785
It <i>is</i> my fault.

927
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:56,621
Because I'm a fake!

928
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,456
Princess!

929
01:37:58,582 --> 01:38:02,627
I never dreamed
things would turn out like this!

930
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:03,962
Of course not.

931
01:38:04,713 --> 01:38:07,632
But it's not your fault.

932
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:24,107
<i>Now, in spite of her wishes,
there was even more talk of her.</i>

933
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:28,320
<i>His Majesty himself
became interested.</i>

934
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,659
She has toyed with
five of the greatest nobles.

935
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,536
Fascinating.

936
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:38,997
That must mean...

937
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:44,502
... this "Princess Kaguya"
wishes to come to me.

938
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:50,008
Send word that she is to come
and serve at court.

939
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:51,593
Yes, Sire.

940
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:56,681
If she comes, I'll give her father,
Sanuki no Miyatsuko...

941
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,892
... a court rank!

942
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,852
Yes, Sire.

943
01:39:01,645 --> 01:39:03,438
Thanks be to Heaven!

944
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:05,690
Your Highness!

945
01:39:05,815 --> 01:39:07,525
Please! No more of this!

946
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:09,027
Your Highness!

947
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:15,033
Your Highness! Rejoice!

948
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:20,205
His Majesty summons you
to serve him at court!

949
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:24,042
You'll be one of his ladies.

950
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:26,795
And I'll wear a courtier's cap!

951
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,214
Thanks be to Heaven!

952
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,384
You still don't understand
how she feels?

953
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:34,344
<i>You</i> don't understand!

954
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:37,138
This is what I've worked for!

955
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:39,057
A court lady!

956
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:43,228
There is no greater happiness
for a girl in this land!

957
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:47,899
At last the princess will be happy!

958
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,401
Father...

959
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:52,737
... I'm sorry, but please refuse.

960
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:55,907
I couldn't be His Majesty's now.

961
01:39:56,533 --> 01:40:00,412
What?! This is for your sake...

962
01:40:00,537 --> 01:40:02,247
Tell him no.

963
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,582
But...

964
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:09,421
... no one in this land may disobey
an order from His Majesty!

965
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:12,632
Now, please!
Don't be so contrary!

966
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:18,596
If you wish to accuse me...

967
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:21,933
... of disobedience to His Majesty...

968
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:26,730
... then feel free to kill me.

969
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,106
Princess!

970
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:34,946
If your happiness depends
on a courtier's cap...

971
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:38,450
... then I will go to him.

972
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:44,289
When I see you wearing that cap,
then I will kill myself.

973
01:40:58,053 --> 01:41:01,306
What? She refuses?

974
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:03,475
What can this mean?

975
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:08,271
I never dreamed a woman
would ever turn me down.

976
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:14,486
Fascinating.
I wish to meet her all the more.

977
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:20,617
In that case, I'll pay a quiet visit
to the Miyatsuko mansion.

978
01:41:21,618 --> 01:41:22,994
Yes, Sire.

979
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:42,180
This way, please.

980
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:49,270
She plays wonderfully.

981
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:13,044
How beautiful!

982
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:29,060
Come with me to the palace.

983
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,271
Why are you doing this?!

984
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:35,066
No woman is unhappy
when I do this.

985
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,735
I will never be yours!

986
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:43,074
You must be, if I wish it.

987
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:46,077
Bring the palanquin!

988
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,084
What?

989
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:54,752
Where are you?

990
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,427
Where did you go?

991
01:43:22,405 --> 01:43:27,952
I apologize for acting in haste.
Please show yourself.

992
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:30,288
Please.

993
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,959
I will burn the sight of you
into my eyes and leave.

994
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:46,804
How beautiful!

995
01:43:49,933 --> 01:43:51,601
Forgive me.

996
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:58,650
I will withdraw.

997
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:02,070
But I still believe...

998
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:05,323
... your happiness lies in being mine.

999
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,827
Beautiful!

1000
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:41,234
<i>His Majesty returned to his palace.</i>

1001
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:46,197
<i>Now, every night
that the moon was out...</i>

1002
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:49,367
<i>... the princess would gaze up at it.</i>

1003
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:11,764
What's wrong?

1004
01:45:12,515 --> 01:45:15,560
Lately you don't come to see me.

1005
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:22,233
You've left your spinning to sit,
and your garden to grow wild.

1006
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:25,570
You sit every night
and gaze at the moon.

1007
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:28,406
What's the matter?

1008
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:30,074
Nothing.

1009
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:33,077
It's something.

1010
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:36,581
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

1011
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:39,709
There's really nothing wrong.

1012
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:41,753
That's not true.

1013
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:52,263
Can't you tell even me?

1014
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:01,939
I don't want to go back
to the Moon!

1015
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:04,108
"Go back"?

1016
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:06,110
"To the Moon"?

1017
01:46:06,235 --> 01:46:10,615
I've begged them to let me stay!

1018
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:13,284
Here! In this land!

1019
01:46:14,077 --> 01:46:18,206
But they're coming for me
on the 15th night!

1020
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,957
Coming for you?

1021
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:24,629
I don't understand.

1022
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:26,964
Your Highness...

1023
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:31,803
... tell me something
that makes sense.

1024
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:37,475
You poor thing!
This is serious, isn't it.

1025
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,992
I am one who was sent down here
from the Moon.

1026
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:56,661
The Moon?!

1027
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,666
So that's what it was!

1028
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:02,834
Yes.

1029
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:08,840
I only realized that
when His Majesty came.

1030
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:15,513
And now on the 15th
I must leave you...

1031
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,057
... and go back.

1032
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:22,687
To the Moon? And leave us?

1033
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,357
What have we done
to deserve this?

1034
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:31,487
Everything we've done has been
for your happiness!

1035
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:37,493
That happiness you wished for me
was hard to bear.

1036
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:40,496
Without realizing it...

1037
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:43,541
... I prayed to the Moon to save me.

1038
01:47:44,167 --> 01:47:48,880
When His Majesty embraced me,
my heart screamed out...

1039
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:52,049
... "I don't want to be here!"

1040
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:58,055
You deliberately called them
to take you back?

1041
01:47:58,514 --> 01:48:01,726
How could you!

1042
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:04,520
What have you done?!

1043
01:48:04,729 --> 01:48:07,940
But I don't want to go.
Not like this!

1044
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,901
Then why not just stay?

1045
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:13,571
Fine! Even if they come
to take you...

1046
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,406
... I won't let them!

1047
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:17,074
It's too late...

1048
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,576
... for everything!

1049
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:24,916
What have I been doing down here?!

1050
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:29,086
Throwing tantrums about
belonging to someone...

1051
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:31,589
... ignoring your wishes...

1052
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:36,052
... and fooling myself with
fake meadows and mountains!

1053
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:45,770
But now that I have to leave
I finally remember...

1054
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:52,777
... why I came down to this place...

1055
01:48:53,694 --> 01:49:00,952
... and why, in this strange land,
I'd always known that song.

1056
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:08,960
"Birds, bugs, beasts"...

1057
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:11,963
That's right.

1058
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:18,970
I was born to truly live!
Just like the birds and the beasts.

1059
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:25,643
I don't want to leave!

1060
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:29,897
Do you think I'd let you go?!

1061
01:49:30,273 --> 01:49:34,819
From the day I took you
out of that bamboo stalk...

1062
01:49:35,278 --> 01:49:38,990
... I've loved you
as if you were my own child!

1063
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:47,331
When I held you, changed you,
set you on your feet...

1064
01:49:47,623 --> 01:49:51,502
... I was as happy as if
I were in Heaven!

1065
01:49:57,466 --> 01:49:59,677
It's not too late!

1066
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:02,930
You're still here!

1067
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:06,183
Here in my arms!

1068
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:08,936
We'll drive them away!

1069
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:13,357
No matter how many come for you!

1070
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,693
Is anyone here?!

1071
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:19,113
Prepare to defend the princess!

1072
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:25,369
I'm sorry, Father.

1073
01:50:37,298 --> 01:50:39,842
What a lot of noise!

1074
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:45,681
Let's sing to keep up our spirits.

1075
01:50:55,274 --> 01:50:59,195
Round, round, go round

1076
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:03,032
Waterwheel, go round

1077
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,869
Go round, and call Mr Sun

1078
01:51:07,203 --> 01:51:11,207
Go round, and call Mr Sun

1079
01:51:11,332 --> 01:51:15,211
Birds, bugs, beasts

1080
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:19,048
Grass, trees, flowers

1081
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:23,052
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

1082
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:27,390
Bring spring and summer,
fall and winter

1083
01:51:29,684 --> 01:51:35,398
Go round, come round,
come round

1084
01:51:35,523 --> 01:51:40,903
Come round, O distant time

1085
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:46,575
Come round,
call back my heart

1086
01:51:46,826 --> 01:51:52,081
Come round,
call back my heart

1087
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:57,586
Birds, bugs, beasts

1088
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:02,633
Grass, trees, flowers

1089
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:09,265
Teach me how to feel

1090
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:17,690
If I hear that you pine for me

1091
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:25,781
I will return to you

1092
01:52:29,744 --> 01:52:32,288
There's another verse to that song?

1093
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:34,290
Long ago...

1094
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:40,129
... someone who'd come back from here
used to sing it on the Moon.

1095
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:47,136
When you put on the robe of the Moon,
you lose all memory of this place.

1096
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:49,805
All grief and sadness are gone.

1097
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:56,812
But when she sang that song,
tears would come to her eyes.

1098
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:05,154
And for some reason, that magic
took my heart, too.

1099
01:53:06,614 --> 01:53:10,659
And now I understand
exactly how she felt.

1100
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:14,997
And why I yearned for here,
and broke the rules...

1101
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:18,793
... and maybe why
I was sent down here.

1102
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:20,669
Princess!

1103
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:23,005
She wanted...

1104
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:29,178
... to come back here.
I'm sure of it!

1105
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:35,684
"If I hear that you pine for me,
I will return to you."

1106
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:40,314
"If you are truly waiting for me...

1107
01:53:40,606 --> 01:53:43,859
"... I will come straight back."

1108
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:48,197
I want to go home! Right now!

1109
01:53:53,994 --> 01:53:57,832
Prepare a carriage, please.
Don't tell anyone.

1110
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:48,757
All these ginger flowers!

1111
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,620
It's been a long time.

1112
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:18,662
Num-nums!

1113
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:20,956
What, are you hungry?

1114
01:55:29,256 --> 01:55:30,799
Did you hear that?

1115
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:33,677
Nope.

1116
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:35,638
I'll go on ahead.

1117
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:59,161
Sutemaru?

1118
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:00,287
Is that you?

1119
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:01,997
Li'l Bamboo?

1120
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:03,999
Can I call you that?

1121
01:56:09,797 --> 01:56:12,341
We're just getting back here.

1122
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:16,178
Coming over the pass,
I thought I heard you singing.

1123
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:18,180
I'm so glad to see you!

1124
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,184
Uh, yeah.

1125
01:56:23,978 --> 01:56:26,855
But why are you here,
and dressed like that?

1126
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:30,025
All this time
I've wanted to come home.

1127
01:56:30,985 --> 01:56:32,695
"Home"?

1128
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:34,738
Here?

1129
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:36,031
Yes.

1130
01:56:37,825 --> 01:56:40,077
Didn't you like the capital?

1131
01:56:41,537 --> 01:56:46,875
You had nice clothes, a mansion,
fine food...

1132
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:51,588
All the time I was thinking about
how we all used to play here.

1133
01:56:51,714 --> 01:56:54,466
They'll all be here soon.

1134
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,885
With you, Sutemaru...

1135
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:05,853
With you, Sutemaru,
I might have been happy.

1136
01:57:07,104 --> 01:57:08,647
With me?

1137
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:11,233
Now I realize that.

1138
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:14,236
Yeah, right!

1139
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:18,073
You couldn't live like we do.

1140
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:21,744
Sure I could!
I did when we were kids.

1141
01:57:32,046 --> 01:57:33,255
In these clothes?

1142
01:57:34,214 --> 01:57:36,425
Half-starving, eating roots?

1143
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,763
Sometimes having to steal?

1144
01:57:40,888 --> 01:57:42,431
I saw that!

1145
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:47,102
I got you beaten up.

1146
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:48,687
That was nothing.

1147
01:57:48,854 --> 01:57:53,442
You're right! As long as you can
answer back by being alive.

1148
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,781
I'm sure I would have been happy.

1149
01:58:03,744 --> 01:58:04,953
Li'l Bamboo!

1150
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:08,207
But it won't happen.

1151
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,626
It's too late.

1152
01:58:10,876 --> 01:58:12,127
Too late?

1153
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:16,298
His Majesty?

1154
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:17,466
No!

1155
01:58:17,716 --> 01:58:19,384
No one will own me!

1156
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,302
Well, then...

1157
01:58:20,469 --> 01:58:21,303
It won't happen.

1158
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:23,472
Why not? We could start now.

1159
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,642
Let's run away.

1160
01:58:26,767 --> 01:58:27,851
Right now!

1161
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:30,312
I'll carry you on my back.

1162
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:33,649
We'll go far away,
where no one knows us.

1163
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:36,985
I can't run away now.

1164
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:38,737
Sure you can!

1165
01:58:39,029 --> 01:58:41,490
If they find us, I'll protect you!

1166
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:43,492
They've already found me.

1167
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:45,327
What do you mean?

1168
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:47,830
I've been found.

1169
01:58:50,124 --> 01:58:51,583
So you've been found.

1170
01:58:52,459 --> 01:58:53,585
So what?!

1171
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:55,045
Who cares?

1172
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:56,588
I want us to run away!

1173
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,426
Come on!

1174
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,721
Sutemaru!

1175
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,224
Right!

1176
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:13,522
I'll run, too! As fast as I can!

1177
01:59:35,002 --> 01:59:36,378
Li'l Bamboo!

1178
01:59:36,837 --> 01:59:37,713
Li'l Bamboo!

1179
01:59:37,838 --> 01:59:39,381
Sutemaru!

1180
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:09,745
O heaven and earth!
Take me in!

1181
02:01:37,457 --> 02:01:38,542
Please!

1182
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:41,003
Let me stay a little longer!

1183
02:01:41,712 --> 02:01:46,174
Just a little longer, to feel
the joy of living in this place!

1184
02:01:46,383 --> 02:01:47,676
What do you mean?

1185
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:49,511
I'm holding you!

1186
02:01:49,761 --> 02:01:52,848
Hold me tighter! Don't let me go!

1187
02:01:56,977 --> 02:01:58,186
Li'l Bamboo!

1188
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:00,647
Li'l Bamboo!

1189
02:02:18,665 --> 02:02:20,042
Li'l Bamboo!

1190
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:22,711
Li'l Bamboo!

1191
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:26,548
A dream?

1192
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:32,220
I dreamed that?

1193
02:02:34,848 --> 02:02:36,725
Poppa!

1194
02:02:37,351 --> 02:02:39,061
Poppa!

1195
02:02:54,368 --> 02:02:55,744
Poppa!

1196
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:17,015
<i>Now, at last,
August 15th came round.</i>

1197
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:04,771
Loose arrows!

1198
02:04:39,264 --> 02:04:40,182
Princess!

1199
02:04:40,599 --> 02:04:41,808
Princess!

1200
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:45,312
Princess!

1201
02:04:45,437 --> 02:04:47,814
Princess!

1202
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:49,316
Princess!

1203
02:05:19,304 --> 02:05:20,055
Princess...

1204
02:06:35,672 --> 02:06:38,633
Birds, bugs, beasts

1205
02:06:39,467 --> 02:06:43,263
Grass, trees, flowers

1206
02:06:43,597 --> 02:06:47,267
Flower, bear fruit, and die

1207
02:06:47,601 --> 02:06:51,271
Be born, grow up, and die

1208
02:06:51,396 --> 02:06:55,191
Still the wind blows, the rain falls

1209
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:59,112
The waterwheel goes round

1210
02:06:59,487 --> 02:07:03,116
Lifetimes come and go in turn

1211
02:07:03,575 --> 02:07:07,621
Lifetimes come and go in turn

1212
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:09,956
Princess!

1213
02:07:10,415 --> 02:07:15,670
Lifetimes come and go in turn

1214
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:21,968
Princess! Don't go!

1215
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:23,637
Wait!

1216
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:25,639
Please, wait.

1217
02:07:26,931 --> 02:07:28,933
Once I don this robe...

1218
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:32,979
... I will forget everything
about this place.

1219
02:07:33,355 --> 02:07:35,482
Give me a little more time.

1220
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:39,486
Princess!

1221
02:07:44,282 --> 02:07:46,159
Momma! Poppa!

1222
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:49,496
Princess!

1223
02:07:49,621 --> 02:07:52,123
Take us with you!

1224
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:56,127
Poppa, Momma... forgive me!

1225
02:07:57,128 --> 02:07:59,172
Come along.

1226
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:02,342
In the purity of
the City of the Moon...

1227
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:07,347
... leave behind
this world's sorrow and uncleanness.

1228
02:08:07,472 --> 02:08:08,848
It's not unclean!

1229
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:13,728
There's joy, there's grief...

1230
02:08:13,853 --> 02:08:17,357
All who live here feel them
in all their different shades!

1231
02:08:17,982 --> 02:08:20,360
There's birds, bugs, beasts...

1232
02:08:20,485 --> 02:08:22,028
... grass, trees, flowers...

1233
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,197
... and feelings.

1234
02:08:27,409 --> 02:08:28,702
Princess!

1235
02:08:40,505 --> 02:08:42,382
Princess!

1236
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:06,239
Princess!

1237
02:09:35,393 --> 02:09:39,272
Forgive me!

1238
02:11:34,846 --> 02:11:41,561
<i>The joy I felt when I touched you</i>

1239
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:48,067
<i>Went deep, deep down</i>

1240
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:57,076
<i>And seeped into</i>

1241
02:11:57,368 --> 02:12:03,082
<i>Every nook and cranny of this body</i>

1242
02:12:04,292 --> 02:12:10,757
<i>Even if I'm far away</i>

1243
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:19,766
<i>And no longer understand anything</i>

1244
02:12:20,725 --> 02:12:27,106
<i>Even when the time comes</i>

1245
02:12:27,565 --> 02:12:34,948
<i>For this life to end</i>

1246
02:12:36,366 --> 02:12:42,121
<i>Everything of now</i>

1247
02:12:43,957 --> 02:12:50,630
<i>Is everything of the past</i>

1248
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:58,471
<i>We'll meet again, I'm sure</i>

1249
02:12:58,930 --> 02:13:05,478
<i>In some nostalgic place</i>

1250
02:13:38,469 --> 02:13:45,351
<i>The warmth you gave me</i>

1251
02:13:45,643 --> 02:13:52,025
<i>Deep, deep down</i>

1252
02:13:53,484 --> 02:14:01,200
<i>Comes to me now, complete</i>

1253
02:14:01,659 --> 02:14:06,706
<i>From a time long past</i>

1254
02:14:08,332 --> 02:14:15,548
<i>Steadily in my heart</i>

1255
02:14:16,174 --> 02:14:24,057
<i>The flames of passion give light</i>

1256
02:14:24,682 --> 02:14:31,397
<i>And softly soothe my pain</i>

1257
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:39,072
<i>Down to the depths of my grief</i>

1258
02:14:40,531 --> 02:14:46,913
<i>Everything now</i>

1259
02:14:47,747 --> 02:14:54,253
<i>Is hope for the future</i>

1260
02:14:55,046 --> 02:15:01,594
<i>I'll remember, I'm sure</i>

1261
02:15:01,886 --> 02:15:10,269
