"The dark times
when those terrible sea beasts

would ravage our shores,

22

Lights-out was an hour ago.
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

So we're not going to have
any more attempts now, are we?

Absolutely not.

Aye, a red tail. Biggest I ever saw.
Just under the surface.

with the greatest
and most terrible thing in the sea,

84
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,083
it's best not to wait till after.

85
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,541
There might not be an after.

[suspenseful music playing]

91
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,250
It's Jim Nicklebones' ship.

92
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,833
- It looks like he's found a brickleback.
- I'd say it found him.

93
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,000
We have to help him.

- We press on.
- What?

97
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,802
[Captain Crow] If Jim Nicklebones were
half the sea dog he says he is,

98
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,500
he wouldn't be in this mess.

99
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,583
Captain, you know the code.

100
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,791
It binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.

101
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,541
And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.

102
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Ms. Merino, set a new course.

103
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,166
Aye, Captain.

It's too much, Captain! We're going down!

122
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,875
[Nicklebones] This is it, mates!

123

Aye, and cross the T.

Clever fish.

188
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,833
It's gone upwind.

189
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,833
Stand to. Wait for the word!

190
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,083
[Ms. Merino] You heard the captain!
Hands to braces.

191
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,750
Stand by, all!

192
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,666
No birds.

193
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,750
It's smarter than we think.
The line's been severed.

[music fades]

264
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,708
[Jacob] Captain.

265
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,208
- Captain.
- [woman] He's coming to.

266
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,583
Captain! Captain!

[wood creaks]

276
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,416
Captain, the mizzen's in splinters,
and I don't like the main.

277
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,833
She can't fight.

278
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,250
Then we'll come back
for the Bluster when she can.

279
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,166
- Repairs shouldn't take too...
- Set a course for Three Bridges.

280
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,416
We're going home.

281
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,791
[man] Right mess, aren't ya?

282
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,708
Let's get you fixed up.

283
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,291
[Mr. Crisp] If you know
what's good for ya,

284
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,541
you'll keep clear of the captain.

285
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,166
He was close enough
to smell that red devil.

286
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,125
But if he can't have the Bluster's hide,
he'll have ours, to be sure.

287
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,291
[coughing]

288
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,833
Why, it's gloomy
as the Helgard trenches in here.

289
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,541
[grunts] We've taken
some right proper monsters on this hunt,

290
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,041
and the royals will pay us accordingly.

291
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,458
And then we'll come back,
and we'll take that red devil.

292
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,625
Can we beat it, Jacob?
They say the Bluster moves the very sea.

293
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,833
Aye, and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes, they say.

294
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,958
It's enough to make your knees wobble.

295
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,416
But I ain't afraid,
'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.

296
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,500
This ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other,

297
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,708
and she's got the scars to prove it.

298
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,500
As do we, Jacob! [laughs]

299
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:22,916
Aye.

300
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,833
And every hunter's scar is a life saved.

301
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,750
A merchant sailor on their first voyage.

302
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,208
A mother.

303
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,541
A son.

304
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,833
All hunters die of the same thing.

305
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,458
Aye, being a hunter. [laughs]

306
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,833
That's right. Being a hunter.

307
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,666
But every hunter dies a great death.

308
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,250
[uplifting music playing]

309
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,750
Because every hunter lives a great life!

310
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:59,458
[sailors chatter and laugh]

311
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,916
- [Sarah] Jacob!
- [music stops]

312
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,291
Captain would like a word.

313
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,541
Speaking of dying a great death.

314
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,458
Nice knowing you, Jacob!

315
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,958
[laughter]

316
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:16,625
We'll think of you often and fondly.
[laughs]

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,666
You wanted to see me, Captain?

318
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,708
Sit.

319
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,500
Captain, we'll get the Bluster.

320
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,666
We know where it is now,
and you will have your revenge.

321
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,416
I'm... I'm just sorry it wasn't today.

322
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:42,666
Jacob, I hate that devil
with every fiber in me being,

323
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,541
but saving Jim Nicklebones
was the right thing to do.

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,583
You steered me right today.

325
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,708
Well, I'm... I-I'm glad you see it that way.

326
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,791
So we'll go home,
collect our bounty, and repair the ship.

327
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:03,750
And we'll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it.

328
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,416
[sighs]

329
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,166
And then what?

330
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,083
What is to become of the Inevitable

331
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,208
after I'm gone?

332
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,291
[sighs]

333
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,666
Through battle and wear,

334
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,375
every beam, block,
and spar has been replaced

335
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,166
since the day she was launched.

336
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,000
Yet she lives on.

337
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,875
It's an eternal thing.

338
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,708
But I am not.

339
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,458
[door creaks]

340
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,125
Come.

341
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,875
Here is my greatness.

342
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,500
My father's before me,

343
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,166
and his father's before him.

344
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,541
On the day we take the Red Bluster,

345
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,375
I will make me last entry as captain.

346
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
Then it'll be your time.

347
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,541
I've known it since the day
I pulled you from the sea.

348
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,208
[soft music playing]

349
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,125
<i>You'd been out there for days.</i>

350
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,291
But there was something in you, Jacob.

351
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,041
A fire that wouldn't die.

352
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,166
Then I held you,

353
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,291
and I knew.

354
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,875
The fates had brought me a son.

355
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,958
And that one day,
you would be captain of the Inevitable.

356
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,416
The day you found me,

357
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:02,750
I swore I would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons.

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,416
If you would grant me this ship,
I would accept,

359
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,125
and it would be my honor.

360
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,000
[chuckles]

361
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,708
My boy.

362
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,041
You're gonna do great things.

363
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,125
[jaunty music playing]

364
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,958
It's the Inevitable!
The Inevitable's back!

365
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,166
- Look!
- What a sight!

366
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,375
[boy] Bet she's got a belly full of bones!

367
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,333
[man] The Inevitable!

368
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,791

[crowd shouting]

372
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
[Sarah] It's good to be home at last,

373
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,208
but it will be a short stay, I'm afraid.

374
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:11,375
Captain Crow will visit
the king and queen at first light.

375
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,208
And when the ship is ready,

376
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,083
we'll be off to kill a monster!

377
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,500
- [crowd cheers]
- We're going after the Red Bluster!

378
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,291
So if this be our last visit
to Three Bridges,

379
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,291
I expect some right, proper debauchery!

380
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,208
[crowd cheers]

381
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,708
[Sarah] Go on, then.
Make way for the hunters.

382
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,791
[grunts]

383
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,000
[Sarah] Here we go, mates!

384
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,291
[Jacob laughs]

385
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,666
The Crown will pay well for them horns.

386
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,791
- So the drinks are on us!
- [crowd cheers]

387
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,041
No one goes thirsty tonight, swabbies!

388
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,541

Hello!

00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,500
Hello.

405
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,166
Me name's Maisie.

406
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,500
Maisie Brumble.

407
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,625
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

408
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,375
And you're Jacob Holland,

409
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,541
who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.

410
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,250
Is it true you done that?

411
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,875
Four in two days?

412
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:51,041
Don't believe everything you hear, lass.
Four in two days? [scoffs]

413
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,625
It was five.

414
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,791
I heard...

415
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,208
[tankards clatter]

416
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,625
I heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore,

417
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,083
pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch,

418
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,500
and swallow her up!

419
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,083
But not no more.
And it's 'cause of the hunters.

420
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,791
There's not a nobler profession, I says.

421
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,458
I come from a long line of hunters meself.

422
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,541
Is that so?

423
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,250
Aye. Me parents were lancers.
They served on the Monarch.

424
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,583
The Monarch.

425
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,666
- So they're...
- Aye.

426
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,583
That's just the way for a hunter,
ain't it?

427
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,125
You live a great life
and die a great death.

428
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,791
Huh. Come on.

429
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,083
So, uh, who's looking after you then?

430
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm staying at a children's home
in Guelston, up the way.

431
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,750
Except I ain't staying exactly.

432
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,791
I'm on the run, you see.

433
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,791
And I ain't going back.

434
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,000
'Cause I'm joining your crew.

435
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:56,916
[splutters]

436
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,250
[chuckles] Oh, no, you ain't.
A hunting ship ain't no place for a kid.

437
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,708
You joined the ship when you were me age,
and look at you now.

438
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,333
You're a weapon
against nature's darkest design.

439
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,541
It says so on page 92.

440
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,500
Look, kid, I'm clever with a spear,
but I've been lucky more than once.

441
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,291
There's no guarantee
of making it to page 92.

442
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,375
Trust me.

443
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,791
Now, you should run along.

444
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:29,958
Right, then. I'll talk to Captain Crow.
That's a man with real authority. [grunts]

445
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,333
Do you know
where I might find Captain Crow?

446
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,541
Hey! I... I have authority.

447
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,875
- All right?
- You ain't captain, are ya?

448
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,458
Uh, no, but I am captain material.

449
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,166
[laughs] "Captain material?"

450
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,125
[clears throat]

451
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:50,500
- Sorry. It just sounds funny.
- I mean, I will <i>be </i>captain.

452
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,458
- Someday.
- Well, I intend to get on that ship.

453
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,500
So, if you don't mind,

454
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,375
I'll take it up with Captain Now,

455
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,750
not Captain Someday.

456
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,291
Hey! Put me down! Let me go!

457
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,041
Monster hunters are supposed to be heroes.

458
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,958
[Jacob] And here's me saving you.

459
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,333
Evening, Rosie. You go through Guelston?

460
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,416
Aye.

461
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,666
Right. Let her out there and not before.

462
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,166
- If that's not too much trouble.
- Aye.

463
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,208
Hey! [grunts]

464
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,125
This is kidnapping!

465
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,416
[Jacob] No, love. It's the opposite
of kidnapping. [whistles]

466
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
[dramatic music playing]

467
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,083
- [Jacob sighs]
- New friend, Jacob?

468
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,416
Ah, just some kid.

469
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,458
Urgh. Horrible things, children.

470
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,125
[Jacob] You can say that again.

471
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,500
[clanging]

472
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,916
[groans]

473
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,208
[regal music playing]

474
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,041
[man] Captain Crow!
[child] It's full of brickleback!

475
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,708
[regal music continues]

476
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:18,666
Well, if it isn't Captain Crow
and his loyal mates.

477
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:24,541
Your Grace, as you can see,
the oceans have offered abundant prey.

478
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,833
And I see you've taken
a full-grown brickleback.

479
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,291
A specimen like that
garners quite a bounty.

480
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:35,083
But there's something I don't see.

481
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,208
The horn of the Red Bluster.

482
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:42,708
Admiral Hornagold has reported a rumor...

483
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,875
[all] Admiral Hornagold?

484
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,166
...that you spotted the Red Bluster,
but abandoned your pursuit

485
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,291
because of a certain code.

486
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:59,041
The royals don't pay you
to honor such codes.

487
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,833
They pay you to kill monsters.

488
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:08,958
How many more ships will be lost
because you let the Bluster slip away?

489
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:16,458
[king] This was once a small kingdom
with a big idea.

490
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:20,250
To send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores

491
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:24,125
and usher in a new era of peace.

492
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:28,083
It's been hundreds of years
since the dark times,

493
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,791
but as long as the Bluster lives,

494
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,291
people will still
look to the seas with fear.

495
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:38,750
So today marks the beginning of a new era.

496
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:42,875
The Crown will no longer
support the hunters.

497
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,541
She's quite a sight, isn't she?

498
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:48,166
The Imperator is the most
heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.

499
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,750
The Royal Navy will push
deep into the unknown world

500
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:56,166
and eradicate every sea beast in our path.

501
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:57,833
Not in that thing.

502
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,250
She rests too low.

503
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,958
And them fixed cannons is useless.

504
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,333
And her Captain is an ass.

505
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,666
[gasps] It's time
for you to leave, Captain.

506
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,666
Your time is up.

507
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:17,000
Admiral, have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?

508
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,291
Don't send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that.

509
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,500
It's not built for hunting,

510
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,583
and neither are you.

511
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:30,333
I assure you,
I am not afraid of those beasts.

512
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,625
Then you're a fool!

513
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,375
And you'll take
a lot of good sailors down with you!

514
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,833
General, see the hunters out.
We're done with them.

515
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:42,333
We hunters have shed blood,
while you lot hid behind walls

516
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,541
and drew lines on maps.

517
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,333
You're cowards, the lot of ya!

518
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:50,458
General, the Captain
is to be placed under arrest,

519
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,541
and the Inevitable decommissioned.

520
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,958
W-W-Wait, wait!

521
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,958
Uh, Your Grace. [chuckles nervously]

522
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,250
The, uh... The Captain
is well-known for his temper,

523
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,333
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well.

524
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,041
He's opened the seas

525
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,375
and made your empire
the envy of the known world.

526
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:18,250
Now, I believe the world
still needs the hunters,

527
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,416
so prove me wrong.

528
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,125
Give us one more try for the Bluster.

529
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:28,125
If we take it, you keep your promise,
and we continue our alliance.

530
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,250
If the Imperator takes the Bluster,

531
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,291
well, you can tear down
the Inevitable for scrap,

532
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,916
and the days of the hunters will be over.

533
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,666
Either way,

534
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
you win.

535
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,458
I, for one, would relish the opportunity.

536
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,750
Then we have a contest.

537
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,666
Get set.

538
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,458
Go.

539
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,500
We'll take the Bluster
and bring it to your doorstep.

540
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,333
The days of hunters are not over.

541
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,083
Not nearly.

542
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,875
[dramatic music playing]

543
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,416
When we reach the Dregmorr,
we'll follow the trenches.

544
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,916
We stay battle-ready, clear decks,
sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.

545
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,041
The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.

546
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:22,208
- Best to use the long spears.
- [indistinct shouting]

547
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:27,250
[Sarah] <i>Them archers won't do any good,
but we've got plenty of carcass shot.</i>

548
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,541
[Captain Crow] <i>We'll hit it with fire,
then go for a sleigh ride.</i>

549
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,625
<i>That's the way with something like this.</i>

550
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,500
[Jacob] <i>We're ready, Captain.
We'll take that red demon.</i>

551
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,333
For we are hunters.

552
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,708
And we will bring all of our skill

553
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:46,125
and all of our rage down upon this beast.

554
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,875
And there will be justice!

555
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,791
[cheering]

556
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:55,000
But that will not be the end
of this great ship.

557
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,583
For no one has sailed
beyond the Dregmorr Sea.

558
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,291
No one knows what dangers lurk

559
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,208
in that terrible unknown.

560
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,583
But it will be this ship,

561
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:10,250
under Jacob Holland,
that will pierce the darkness.

562
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,208
[cheering]

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So let's drink to a successful hunt,
with many more to come.

564
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,791
[cheering and shouting]

565
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,458
- [Maisie] Ow!
- [sailor 1] What was that?

566
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:32,041
- [sailor 2] It came from the keg.
- [sailor 3] What was that?

567
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,125
[Jacob inhales and grunts]

568
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,333
[chuckles]

569
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,583
You stowed away?

570
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,916
I stowed away.

571
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,708
[sighs] You stowed away.

572
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,791
Uh, I...

573
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,625
Yeah.

574
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, we're dropping you off
at the nearest port.

575
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,708
We're going after the Bluster.

576
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,833
- We can't have a kid mucking about.
- [Captain Crow] What's this?

577
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,666
The name's Maisie Brumble,

578
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:05,166
but you need no introduction.

579
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,833
You've been swallowed whole,

580
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:11,125
shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.

581
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:15,666
But the worms won't eat you,
and hell won't take you, so here you are!

582
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,083
The right, proud commander
of the second-greatest hunting ship

583
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,500
what ever sailed.

584
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,083
Second-greatest?

585
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,583
Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?

586
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:28,250
I'm partial to the Monarch,

587
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,708
for it's the ship me parents served on.

588
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:32,958
I see.

589
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,000
Then they died heroes, didn't they?

590
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Aye.

591
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,041
I like this kid.

592
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,291
- She's all vinegar.
- But, C-Captain...

593
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,708
Sarah, be good enough to take her in,
would you?

594
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,500
Aye, Captain.

595
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,333
Congratulations, Captain Someday.

596
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,041
Uh...

597
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,583
[sea shanty playing]

598
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,750
[indistinct chatter]

599
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,000
[sea shanty continues]

600
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,333
[scoffs]

601
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,583
[sea shanty fades]

602
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:09,666
[door closes]

603
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,875
[metal clanks]

604
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,583
[gun cocks]

605
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,916
Sleep there.

606
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:29,583
You're... Sarah Sharpe.

607
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,750
They say no first mate
is more loyal than...

608
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,916
[Sarah] That's enough.

609
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,333
I've heard your speeches, Miss.

610
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:42,250
My speeches kept me on this boat.

611
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:46,291
You're on this boat because Captain Crow
won't stop to put you off it.

612
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,500
The hunt is all.

613
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:53,416
So give him your absolute obedience.

614
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,375
Or fall on that yourself,

615
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,250
because I'll visit worse than death on ya.

616
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,416
You're

617
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,041
amazing.

618
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,500
[sighs]

619
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,583
[sea shanty playing]

620
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,625
[sea shanty fades]

621
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,958
We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.

622
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,208
We've reached the Dregmorr.

623
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,375
Aye, and we'll find
that thing soon enough.

624
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:34,833
[metal scraping]

625
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:42,000
I wonder if I might need
something a little... larger?

626
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,166
Hey, where'd you get that knife?

627
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,625
Sarah gave it to me,
'cause I'm a hunter now.

628
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:51,708
- A hunter who needs to go to bed.
- But I'm too much awake to sleep.

629
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,291
I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.

630
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,833
Them pictures in me books come to life,

631
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,750
and exacting bloody revenge!

632
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,041
Go, get your rest.

633
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,083
Aye, Captain. [chuckles]

634
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,416
We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?

635
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,458
And they'll make statues of us.

636
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,708
We'll kill it, all right. Now get!

637
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,166
[chuckles] Hmm.

638
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:14,708
[giggles]

639
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,875
The monsters, I can handle.

640
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,458
But that one, she'll be the death of me.

641
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:25,750
You'll recall the hunter's code
binds us to all who come before

642
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,541
and all who come after.

643
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,208
[chuckles]

644
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,708
I see a fire in her.

645
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,791
Same fire I saw in you.

646
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,958
- [distant groaning]
- [ropes creak]

647
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:40,875
[gasps]

648
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,500
[creaking]

649
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:44,875
Beat to quarters!

650
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,208
Let's have her ready!

651
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:50,791
Today's the day we do what we do!

652
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:54,291
[indistinct shouting]

653
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:58,125
Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!

654
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:02,333
Harpooners, tie off them darts!
We're going for a sleigh ride!

655
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,916
[Ms. Merino] Heave away!

656
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,791
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [birds squawk]

657
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,250
Brace!

658
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,541
[groaning]

659
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,625
[dramatic music playing]

660
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,375
[dramatic music stops]

661
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,500
- [sighs]
- [beast snorts]

662
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,916
The ocean has sent us its worst,
and we'll send it right back.

663
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,250
Carcass shot if you please, gunners!

664
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,958
Protect our broadside.

665
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,625
[indistinct shouting]

666
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,583
All right, ya fish killers!

667
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,500
We come all this way
for a proper fight and...

668
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,583
[Maisie] Jacob!

669
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,458
What's happening?

670
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,791
Maisie, get back to your room!

671
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,958
- [gasps]
- Go.

672
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,291
[dramatic music playing]

673
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,833

[Jacob grunts]

677
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,208
Stay away from the window.

678
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:13,208
[indistinct shouting]

679
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:14,833
Hurry, lad!

Fire!

Now's our chance! Spears!

[Red Bluster growls]

692
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,458
We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.

693
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,375
Full sail, Ms. Merino!

694
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:13,000
[Ms. Merino] Square the yards!
Get it off the pins!

695
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,750
[Captain Crow] It'll fight the very wind
till there's no fight left in it.

696
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,250
- [dramatic music continues]
- [Red Bluster growls]

697
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,291
Run, ya devil! And there we'll be!

[Sarah] Captain?

[Captain Crow chuckles]

703
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,458
[grunts] We've got you now.

902
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,291
What if we just left 'em alone?

903
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:37,041
We kill them because they kill us.

904
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,708
Do I need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents?

905
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,833
Should they have just left
the monsters alone?

906
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,708
I... don't know.

907
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,875
Oh, you are lost, girl.

908
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,625
Your parents died heroes.

909
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:53,958
I want to believe that,

910
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:59,458
but maybe you can be a hero
and still be wrong.

911
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,333
- You're not making...
- [growling]

912
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:09,125
- You're not making any sense.
- Why did Red swallow us?

913
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,625
Oh, "Red," is it?

914
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,083
She, not it.

915
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:15,458
I think it's a she, and I think
she was protecting us from Crow.

916
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,416
You're giving that beast
way too much credit.

917
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,750
- He was pointing a gun at you, and he...
- He was pointing it at you, through me.

918
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,750
Because you cut them lines.

919
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,666
I don't wanna argue about it, all right?

920
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,708
'Cause I don't want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters

921
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,833
on this island,

922
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:34,041
that, that I wouldn't be on
if you hadn't cut them lines!

923
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,125
So we're not arguing?

924
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,250
So what are we doing?

925
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:46,666
I'm going to gather supplies.

926
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,291
I'll take you to Guelston,
and when I get back to the ship,

927
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,125
we'll finish what we started.

928
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:58,041
Don't... get killed out there.

929
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,750
[Jacob] I won't make any promises.

930
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,291
Jacob.

931
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,750
Promise.

932
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,250
All right.

933
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,041
I promise.

934
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,333
[quiet tense music playing]

935
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
[Sarah] Captain,

936
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:41,833
the beast is gone.

937
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,500
We can't stay out here.

938
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,458
[Captain Crow] That thing took Jacob.

939
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,333
And I want it dead same as you,

940
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:53,125
but we'll founder if we don't get to port.

941
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,458
She's making more water
than we can pump out.

942
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,958
And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.

943
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,000
If we stay out here much longer,
we'll be sunk.

944
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:08,791
[water splashing]

945
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:12,291
[sighs] Shape a course for Mukesh Island.

946
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,666
[gasping]

947
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,583
- But the closest port is...
- Mukesh!

948
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,083
It'll be Mukesh by thunder,
or the ocean floor.

949
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:26,541
Would you be planning a visit
to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?

950
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,250
Captain, her wares come
at too steep a price.

951
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:36,458
To make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunter's code.

952
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,083
Blast whatever code
would bar me my revenge!

953
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,916
There be no charter over me own.

954
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,750
I'll use Batterbie's methods.
I'll do whatever it takes.

955
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:47,916
I'd cleave the very sea

956
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,625
and destroy everything that swims,
scuttles, or bobs if I have to.

957
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,791
But I'll have vengeance.

958
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,708
I'll have vengeance.

959
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:12,458

for a new course! Keep her full and by!

Uh...

[tense music swells]

984
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,000
What are you doing?

985
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:52,541
[Maisie] I, uh...

986
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,625
I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.

987
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,666
You're probably right.

988
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,958
Just don't move.

989
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
[Maisie] I'm sorry,

990
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,416
but I've always wanted a pet.

991
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,416
That's not a pet.

992
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,458
It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.

993
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,375
But I already named it.

994
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,458
Let me guess.

995
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:16,791
Blue.

996
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,583
[Maisie groans]

997
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,916
You named that one Red.
You named this one Blue.

998
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,458
We stay much longer, and we'll have
a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.

999
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:26,208
But he's so cute!

1000
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,750
Look at this face.

1001
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,166
You and I have a different idea of cute.

1002
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,083
[Maisie gasps]

1003
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,166
[Maisie] No!

[branches crack]

1005
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,541
When we get to Guelston,

1006
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,833
I'll get you a cat,
and you can name it Grey or White.

1007
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,541
Ginger, if you like.

1008
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,333
You're too young to be this mean.

1009
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:49,000
And you're too old
to be giving in to childish temptations.

1010
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,250
It ain't childish to want a pet.

1011
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,916
Lots of people have pets.

1012
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,166
Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth

1013
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,916
that hatch and burst out
through your chest cavity!

1014
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,958
That is so specific.

1015
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,916
Well, I seen some things, all right?

1016
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,291
Point is we don't know what he'd do.

1017
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,125
We don't know anything about this island,

1018
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,125
except we've got to get off it,
by thunder!

Maybe they're bonded to us, like geese.

1032
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,125
It's the mother goose I'm worried about.

If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island,
we'll be able to flag a ship.

The Dregmorr is thick with monsters,
but don't worry.

If there's one of them things
within a mile of us, I'll sense it.

Over there, right where I'm pointing?
That's starboard. That's the right.

1187
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,875
More to the right.
Look, see? Over there, right!

Turn to the right,
you infernal bloody sea beast!

Just don't let your guard down, all right?

She's a friend.

We don't need this. We're hunters.

It's always the same reason, you see.

And I can give you what you need.

[Red growls softly]

1265
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:09,833
Yeah, well, you know, I'm, uh...
I'm used to a bigger target, all right?

1266
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:13,708
[Red snorts]

1267
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,250
[tranquil music playing]

1268
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:27,000
[instrumental sea shanty playing]

1269
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,541
[Jacob] Huh.

1270
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,041
[sea shanty continues]

1271
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,125
[Maisie grunts]

1272
01:11:43,791 --> 01:11:45,500
[chuckles] Dinner time! [chuckles]

1273
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:49,833
[sea shanty ends]

1274
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,791
[Blue groans]

1275
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:02,083
[jaunty music playing]

1276
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,666
[Blue squeaks]

1277
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:09,750
[jaunty music ends]

1278
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,750
[Maisie strains]

1279
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,500
[tranquil music playing]

1280
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,666
[both strain]

1281
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:30,333
[Red growls softly]

1282
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:35,083
[soft music playing]

1283
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,291
[Blue squeals]

1284
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,375
[soft music continues]

1285
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:01,666
[soft music fades]

1286
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,750
[Maisie sighs]

1287
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,208
It says here that during the dark times,

1288
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,333
the beast destroyed a town
on the coast of Kra' Zoul.

1289
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:13,666
But we been up and down that coast,
and I ain't never seen no town,

1290
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,500
destroyed or otherwise.

1291
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:19,541
A-And... And we don't say "yar"
half this much.

1292
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,958
E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."

1293
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:24,250
I mean, this is just nonsense.

1294
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,583
Says you.

1295
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,333
But the book says otherwise,

1296
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,625
and it's going to outlast both of us.

1297
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:36,166
So people will believe
the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,

1298
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,916
and hunters like to say "yar."

1299
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,166
But if that ain't true,

1300
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:48,166
then how are you supposed to know what is?

1301
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,930
[Maisie] And how do we know the sea beasts

1302
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,750
ever plucked ladies
out of their veggie patches?

1303
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,083
That there really were the dark times?

1304
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,833
Maybe they didn't start this war.

1305
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,333
Maybe, but

1306
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:05,083
why would we?

1307
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:08,041
[thunder rumbles]

1308
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,500
[thunder crashes]

1309
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,583
[Blue whimpers]

1310
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:18,250
[thunder crashes]

1311
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,791
Looks like a real shipwrecker.

1312
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:28,291
[thunder crashes]

1313
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,041
[tense music playing]

1314

[dramatic music playing]

1316
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,708
[dramatic music fades]

1317
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:57,916
[distant thunder]

1318
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,666
Nicer down here, I'd say.

1319
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,375
Aye.

1320
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,916
Nicer down here.

1321
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,375
[tranquil music playing]

1322
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:41,250

[tranquil music continues]

1324
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,791
I don't know how the war started.

1325
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:19,333
Maybe all that matters is how it ends.

1326
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:25,958
[tranquil music fades]

1327
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:30,041
[ominous music playing]

1328
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,000
It's a blood moon.

1329
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,291
Batterbie's watching.

1330
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:50,750
Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.

1331
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:54,333
And dealing with her ain't honorable.

1332
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:56,333
Aye. There'll be a payment due,

1333
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:59,375
and it's the ship
and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.

1334
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:01,291
[Captain Crow] Sarah!

1335
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,375
Look there.

1336
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:12,666
[squealing]

1337
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,333
Riddlebacks.

1338
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:15,416
Aye.

1339
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,708
They don't come this far north.

1340
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,125
Not unless they're swimming
away from something.

1341
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,416
And there's only one thing
what scares a riddleback.

1342
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,875
The Bluster.

1343
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
[ominous music playing]

1344
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:37,625
[creatures shriek]

1345
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:40,958
Ms. Merino, shape a new course.
Due south, if you please.

1346
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:42,708
Alee of Rum Pepper Island.

1347
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:47,000
Aye, captain.
You heard him! Get it off the pins!

1348
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,083
Haul away now!

1349
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,791
Haul away, all!

1350
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,375
[ominous music continues]

1351
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,583
We'll find you.

1352
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,500
We'll find you soon enough.

1353
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,125
[ominous music fades]

1354
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,250
[Red growls softly]

1355
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:13,708
That ain't you no more.

1356
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:17,500
You're not Jacob Holland
who killed four of them beasts

1357
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,166
in a span of two days.

1358
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,125
It was five.

1359
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:23,416
You're Jacob Holland
who befriended a beast,

1360
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,750
saved me life,

1361
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,416
and led us all the way
to Rum Pepper Island.

1362
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:30,208
[Maisie giggles]

1363
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,041
We made it.

1364
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,125
[uplifting music playing]

1365
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,500
This is as far as Red goes.

1366
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,500
Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,

1367
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:44,166
but we can flag a passing ship.

1368
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:46,708
And then what?

1369
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:51,208
Well, then I'll, uh,
take you to Guelston, won't I?

1370
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:56,125
And what about you?

1371
01:18:58,458 --> 01:18:59,458
[sighs]

1372
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:08,208
Guelston is a place.

1373
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,875
It ain't a family.

1374
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:14,625
I ain't going back there,
and you ain't going back on that ship.

1375
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,166
So all you have is me.

1376
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:20,125
And all I have is you.

1377
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,958
And that don't sound so bad.

1378
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,166
So, what do you say?

1379
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,875
Should we give it a go?

1380
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:37,666
You mean, uh...

1381
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:39,791
You mean, like a family?

1382
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:41,666
Sure.

1383
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:43,458
I-I don't know.

1384
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:49,666
Maybe if we pretend long enough,
it could feel real?

1385
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,416
Never mind. It's stupid.

1386
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,875
What, are you picturing us on a farm
or something?

1387
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,916
I said "never mind," ya donkey.

1388
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:02,708
So never mind.

1389
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,750
It's just I-I don't think I'm...

1390
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,750
You got something in your ears?

1391
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,208
All right, all right.

1392
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:18,708
Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.

1393
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,708
[exciting music playing]

1394
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,375
[music fades]

1395
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:42,041
Well, girl, this has been
an improbable adventure.

1396
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:45,291
And I thank you
for all you've done, but, uh,

1397
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,958
it's time to go home now.

1398
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:02,416
And I promise
I'll never hunt sea monsters again.

1399
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,916
No more monster hunting!

1400

1403
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,125
Hang about.

1404
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,500
[panting] Okay.

1405
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,458
No more!

[groans]

1407
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,916
No more! [grunts]

[yells] Ow!

1409
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,625
Jeez!

1410
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:35,125
[sighs] Look, you understand
the point I'm trying to make here, right?

1411
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:36,833
It's a... It's a symbolic gesture.

1412
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,958
[Red growls softly]

1413
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:42,875
- I think she understands.

1416
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,208
[Jacob] All right, then.

1417
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:56,958
Time to go home.

1418
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,375

Go on, girl. Go home.

Red?

1427
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:38,875
Red!

[Red growls]

1429
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:47,083
Oh no.

[man] Need a hand here.

1433
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:02,500
[Jacob] Red, listen to me.

1434
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,000
Just leave.

1435
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:05,750
This doesn't have to be a fight.

[Jacob and Maisie grunt]

1446
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,208
[Maisie] Red! Come back! [grunts]

1447
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:39,541
All hands, to arms!

1448
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,041

1454
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:54,000
No, Red! Stop!

1455
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:55,916

[Jacob] Maisie!

1461
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,791
Are you all right, lass?

1462
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:14,541
Is Red okay?

1463
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,000
[tense music continues]

1464
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,791

[Red growls softly]

1479
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:18,000
Stay back, beast. Leave her be.

[Red growls]

1486
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,250
It's the Red Bluster.

1487
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,250
The beast is delivered!

1492
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:49,625
No, lass.

1493
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:52,500
There's nothing to be done.

1494
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:55,166
She doesn't have to do this.

1495
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:01,583
Yes, she does.

1496
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:03,458

[tense music continues]

1504
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,416
[Captain Crow] Now is the reckoning.

1505
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:49,791
For all who've been lost,

1506
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,666
I strike at thee, devil!

1507
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,583
[Red roars, moans]

1508
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:15,000

[sad music playing]

1510
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,500
Don't fight.

1511
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:35,083
You'll make the poison flow faster.

1512
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,708
I don't want you to die. Not yet.

1513
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:42,541
Not till you've been immortalized
at Castle Whiterock.

1514
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,458
[sailors strain]

1515

[Red growls]

1516
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:53,750
Captain, might be wiser
to let the poison finish the job.

1517
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:54,833
No, Sarah.

1518
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,541
I made a promise to the king and queen.

1519
01:27:58,416 --> 01:28:00,250
[sailors strain]

1520
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:03,500

[indistinct chatter]

1522
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,166
But I'd not worry.

1523
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,541
There's no fight left in it.

1524
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:21,625
[tense music playing]

1525
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,958
Yes, there is.

1526
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,791
[indistinct shouting]

1527
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,375
[Sarah grunts]

1528
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,791
Raise the studding sails!

1529
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:36,208
To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!

1530
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,041
Hold!

1531
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:40,250
[dramatic music crescendos]

1532
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,416
By the powers...

1533
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Jacob.

1534
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,833
[dramatic music playing]

1535
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,958

[breathes shallowly]

1538
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,166
[Captain Crow] I see.

1539
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,666
That's quite a story, Jacob.

1540
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:32,166
The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.

1541
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:36,250
The beast what took me deadlight.

1542
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,041
What am I to make of ye, Jacob?

1543
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,708
That thing and I,

1544
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,583
we, uh, had, uh,

1545
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:47,708
an understanding.

1546
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:49,458
A truce. Hmm?

1547
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,791
But there cannot be a truce without war.

1548
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:59,375
Whatever happened out there is nothing
against hundreds of years of war.

1549
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,541
I've always known what I was, Jacob.

1550
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:07,541
I'm the son of a captain,
who was the son of a captain.

1551
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:12,083
And if we are born to fight,
then by God, let's fight.

1552
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:17,458
That we may be tested
and find our greatness.

1553
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So I ask you, Jacob, my son,

1554
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,333
are you my enemy?

1555
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:26,208
[tense music playing]

1556
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:30,291

1557
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,291
- [Jacob] Maisie, stop!

01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:33,375
[Maisie coughs]

1559
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:36,416
Let her go!

1560
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,625
[chuckles]

1561
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,083
She's all vinegar.

1562
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:48,458
Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.

1563
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,791
You need to help Red.

1564
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:55,666
She's our friend.

1565
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:57,791
I'm sorry.

1566
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:59,958
[breathes weakly]

1567
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,250
She needs her rest.

1568
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,416
I'll get you back to Guelston.

1569
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,041
You'll be safe.

1570
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:09,125
You'll have a good, long life.

1571
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:13,208
But first, we'll pay a visit
to Castle Whiterock.

1572
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:16,000
We have a date with the king and queen.

1573

[sad music playing]

1574
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,875
Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.

[sad music continues]

1576
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,333
[sailor] Welcome home, lad.

1577
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Good to see ya.

1578
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:39,875
So good to see you.

1579
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,000
[sad music continues]

1580
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,958
[Captain Crow] You're home, Jacob.

1581
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:53,458
Let's toast to the many adventures
that lay ahead of you,

1582
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,791
as captain of the Inevitable.

1586
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,125
You're getting your strength back.

1587
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,208
Too late.

1588
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:25,583
Maybe.

1589
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,916
It's not right what they're doing to Red.

1590
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,458
She saved us.

1591
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:34,375
You have to believe me, please.

1592
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:37,958
I believe you.

1593
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,291
Then help me stop them.

1594
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:45,375
I've been fighting them beasts
all me life,

1595
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:49,166
and I've seen things
that will never go away.

1596
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:52,041
This ship is all I know.

The whole world will know
what we've done, me boy.

1605
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:51,416
This ship, your ship, will live on.

1606
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:54,000

[sad music playing]

1622
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,791
It was them!

1623
01:34:56,916 --> 01:34:58,916
[sad music continues]

1624
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,125
Oh, girl.

1625
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,166
[sad music continues]

1626
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,916
[Maisie strains]

1627
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:19,000
Don't worry, Red.
I-I'll get you out of here.

1628
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
[sad music continues]

1629

[somber regal music playing]

1631
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:45,750
[villagers chatter]

1632
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:47,958
[queen] What is all this?

1633
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:50,416
Why is everyone... [gasps]

1634
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,291
He's done it! He's got the Red Bluster!

1635
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:02,250
[villagers cheer]

1636
01:36:03,416 --> 01:36:06,041
- That'll do, Ms. Merino.
- [Ms. Merino] You heard the captain.

1637
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,125
Drop anchor.

1638
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:12,458
[villagers cheering]

[tense music fades]

1641
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:23,666
Captain Crow.

1642
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:28,208
Well, it looks like we have our winner.

1643
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:30,750
When I last visited Whiterock,

1644
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:35,791
you told me
that the days of hunters were over.

1645
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:39,666
But the Imperator
was no match for the beast.

1646
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:53,041
All of your wealth and power,

1647
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:58,916
all of this is nothing
compared to a hunter's fury.

1648
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,500
[tense music playing]

1649
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,500
[strains]

1650
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:07,291
And it's the Inevitable
what will lead the way

1651
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,875
into the Dregmorr and beyond.

1652
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,958
[tense music continues]

1653
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:17,291
Until the bones
of every one of them beasts

1654
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:19,500
lies at the bottom of the sea!

1655
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:20,916
[villagers gasp]

1656
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:23,333
[Jacob] Captain!

1657
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,583
Jacob,

1658
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,708
get back on the ship.

1659
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:34,833
I can't let you do it.

1660
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,208
You dishonor me, boy.

1661
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:41,916
As you dishonor all them hunters
what come before.

1662
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,625
All them what died heroes.

1663
01:37:45,208 --> 01:37:47,333
Aye, they were heroes.

1664
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:50,416
But you can be a hero

1665
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,291
and still be wrong.

1666
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:54,625
[growls]

1667
01:37:56,166 --> 01:37:58,291
Now give me the lance.

1668
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,583
I thought of you as a son.

1669
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,416
But I don't know you.

1670
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,083
[Captain Crow roars]

1671
01:38:07,166 --> 01:38:10,750
[both grunt]

1672
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,125
I gave you everything!

1673
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:15,875
I gave you life!

1674
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:17,833
- [villagers gasp]
- [Jacob groans]

1675
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,625
You've laid down your lance

1676
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:23,125
and think it's made you strong?

1677
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:25,666
[Jacob panting]

1678
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,416
But you've turned your back
on your own kind.

1679
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:31,458
[both grunt]

- Jacob!
- Jacob!

[tense music fades]

1689
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,416
I should have given you a bigger knife.

1690
01:39:03,875 --> 01:39:05,208
- [Sarah grunts]
- [Maisie gasps]

1691

[growling]

1705
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:52,083
The hunters brought the beast
to the very heart of our kingdom.

1706
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:54,666
For your queen, for all that is good,

1707
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,083
strike it down!

1708
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:58,791

[soft music playing]

1737
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:04,750
No more monster hunting! [grunts]

[uplifting music playing]

[uplifting music continues]

1741
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:22,583
Impossible.

1742
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:27,625
[Red growls softly]

[Red growls softly]

1746
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:45,958
You did good, kid.

1747
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:48,333
I ain't done.

1748
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:04,875
[Maisie] Our books,

1749
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:07,500
our history,

1750
01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:09,458
is a lie.

1751
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,708
I don't believe the beasts
ever threatened our shores.

1752
01:43:16,208 --> 01:43:17,958
It was just a story.

1753
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:21,041
A story told by them!

1754
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:22,500
- [queen gasps]
- [king] What?

1755
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:31,958
For generations,
they've taught us to hate the beasts

1756
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:35,750
and sent the hunters out to destroy them.

1757
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:39,958
And the beasts learned
to fear us and hate us,

1758
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:42,375
and they fought back!

1759
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:46,041
Who are you to malign
your king and queen with such falsehoods?

1760
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:47,958
You have no right to speak!

1761
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:50,041
I have every right!

1762
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:58,125
I come from a long line of hunters
that died your great death!

1763
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:01,791
Your kingdom was paid for
with their blood,

1764
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,833
and their blood!

1765
01:44:03,916 --> 01:44:07,166
Enough! General, give the command.

1766
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:14,916
This war was started
by the kings and queens what come before.

1767
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:18,666
And with every lie, their empire grew.

1768
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:25,041
Now this lot stands on the same perch
and tells the same lies.

1769
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:27,708
For their greed.

1770
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:29,916
General!

1771
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:31,958
[quiet tense music playing]

1772
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:35,958
Let it end.

1773
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,750
Let it end!

1774
01:44:39,541 --> 01:44:41,208
[uplifting music playing]

1775
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:43,208
[child] Listen to her!

1776
01:44:44,916 --> 01:44:46,333
Let the beast go!

1777
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:49,958
[villagers shout]

1778
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:51,500

[queen gasps]

1781
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,541
Listen to the child!

1782
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:04,708
[uplifting music fades]

1783
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:05,833
Now I'm done.

1784
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:09,083
[Jacob sighs]

1785
01:45:09,166 --> 01:45:11,166
[soft music playing]

1786
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,250
All right, Red.

1787
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:13,958
We best go.

1788
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
[soft music continues]

1789
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:20,666
What are you doing?

1790
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:21,625
Fire!

1791
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:23,750
Your queen demands it!

1792
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:25,208
[villagers shouting]

1793
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:30,083
General, shouldn't we fire?

1794
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:32,666
[tense music crescendos]

1795
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,000
My brother was on the Monarch, Sergeant.

1796
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:39,958
[king exhales]

1797
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:43,541
[villagers shouting]

1798
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:46,291
And I want to know how this war started.

1799
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:49,291
[soft music playing]

1800
01:45:53,291 --> 01:45:54,291
[Jacob groans quietly]

1801
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:56,708
