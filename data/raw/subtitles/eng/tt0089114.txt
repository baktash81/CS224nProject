1
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,942
<i>Hey, you! You better get</i>
<i>out of here!</i>

2
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,635
<i>I'm looking for some</i>
<i>Pacific Tech professors. </i>

3
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,509
<i>There's nobody else</i>
<i>around here now!</i>

4
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,405
<i>- Hurry up, jump in!</i>
<i>- There was a girl with them. </i>

5
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,343
<i>- If I could find her!</i>
<i>- Come on, jump in, will you?</i>

6
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,781
<i>- She's kind of lost. </i>
<i>- You look kind of lost yourself. </i>

7
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,881
<i>I think I know where she'll be. </i>

8
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,355
<i>Come on! Come on! It's your last</i>
<i>chance to get out of here!</i>

9
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,231
<i>Wolfgang. </i>

10
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,940
<i>Wake up, Wolfgang, come on. </i>

11
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,013
<i>Wake up!</i>

12
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,774
<i>Wolfgang!</i>

13
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,777
<i>Wolfgang!</i>

14
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,597
Jesus Christ.

15
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,202
Ben, it's 3:00 in the morning.
This had better be good.

16
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,135
<i>I just had one of those</i>
<i>dreams again. </i>

17
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,134
I was flying. It was so real. It was over
this giant circuit board or something.

18
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,413
You know, I had a dream
that I was naked at school.

19
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,775
I had to hide in the bathroom.

20
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,314
<i>- It was terrible. </i>
- So anyway,

21
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,213
I drew as much
as I could remember,

22
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,820
and I'd like you to take a look
at it tomorrow, OK?

23
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,753
Sure.

24
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,192
Can I go back to bed, please?

25
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,021
My mom's coming anyway.
Over and out.

26
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,663
<i>The Martians had no resistance</i>
<i>to the bacteria in our atmosphere</i>

27
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,394
<i>that we have long since</i>
<i>become immune to. </i>

28
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,332
<i>Once they had breathed our air,</i>

29
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,169
<i>the germs which no longer affect us</i>
<i>began to kill them. </i>

30
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,243
<i>The end came swiftly. </i>

31
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,903
<i>All over the world,</i>
<i>their machines began to... </i>

32
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,472
- Yeah!
- Come on!

33
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,577
Get up. Get up.

34
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,913
Kick his ass, man!

35
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,722
Come on, Jackie, kill him!

36
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,420
Go!

37
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,126
- Get him!
- Heard you called me

38
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,729
something funny, Crandall.

39
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,732
- Come on, get him. Let's go!
- What's so funny?

40
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,895
I said you had elephantitis.

41
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,596
Crandall, why can't you talk
like everybody else?

42
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,436
- Kill him, Steve.
- Get off me.

43
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,441
I mean, I don't like people
calling me stuff

44
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,409
when I don't know what it is.

45
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,339
Get...

46
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,785
Elephantitis is when something gets
bloated and ugly, like your ass!

47
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,361
- Come on, you don't learn, do you?
- Cut it out, Jackson.

48
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,298
- Who's gonna make me? You?
- Sure, elephantitis head!

49
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,906
Kick his ass!

50
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,909
Kick his ass.

51
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,241
Let's go, come on!

52
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,281
You can't get away from us now,
buddy!

53
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,111
Go! Go! Go!

54
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,729
Hey.

55
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,600
Everything OK?

56
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,972
This damn carburetor.

57
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,703
Must have rebuilt this thing
100 times.

58
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,009
I just wanted to say thanks for
with Jackson and everything today.

59
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,515
Steve Jackson's a jerk.

60
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,351
He tries it again, I'll kick his butt.

61
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,217
You wanna come over to my house?

62
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,086
I just got this new tape
of <i>This Island Earth</i>.

63
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,252
- It's got this great saucer landing...
- Sounds great.

64
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,730
And it's got, no, it's got this big mutant,
with this, like, two brains.

65
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,802
It's really cool. You'd like it.

66
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,910
Darren! Darren, wait up!

67
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,499
How come you didn't stop?

68
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,135
Look, why don't you
just take off, OK?

69
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,747
I did you a favor, but I didn't know
you're gonna bug me about it

70
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,045
- the rest of my life.
- It's OK. Here, forget it.

71
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,716
Oh, no. My dad's home.

72
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,663
Guess he didn't get that job.

73
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,191
What does he do?

74
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,702
Hauls junk.

75
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,273
Is that your mom?

76
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,339
No.

77
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,675
That's my dad's girlfriend.

78
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,043
She's OK.

79
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,119
Think I will go over to your house.

80
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,217
OK. Well, leave your bike here,
and we'll take the creek.

81
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,595
- Your folks fight a lot?
- My mom died when I was a kid.

82
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,105
My dad's OK.

83
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,743
Just isn't very lucky.

84
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,977
He always breaks things,
or loses them.

85
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,815
Anyway, he taught me how to run.

86
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,812
He can't catch me anymore.

87
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,859
- Your mom and dad still together?
- Yeah. I guess they get along OK.

88
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,559
They just talk about
the stupidest junk all the time.

89
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,666
Where are we going?

90
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,497
Oh, I just wanna see
my friend Wolfgang.

91
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,832
Wolfgang?

92
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,032
Oh, it's not his fault.
His parents won't let him change it.

93
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,210
You'll probably think
he's weird anyway.

94
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,175
Probably.

95
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,774
He's been playing sick,
working on a project.

96
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,816
I wanna see how it's going.

97
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,053
If I had a name like Wolfgang,
I think I'd kill myself.

98
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:58,257
- Benjamin! Come in. And this is?
- Darren.

99
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,092
Darren.

100
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,259
You only have to tell me once.
I never forget anything.

101
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,670
Look, Mommy. This looks
like Uncle Fred.

102
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,340
So it does.

103
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,106
Ludwig, stop that right now.

104
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,479
Have a seat, boys.

105
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,313
Wolfgang is down in his lab.
I'll ring him.

106
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,921
He's feeling much better now.

107
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,583
- Wolfgang.
<i>- Yes, Mother?</i>

108
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:32,023
Benjamin is here
with his friend Derek.

109
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,762
- Have you seen the bug bomb?
- I think it's in the bedroom.

110
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,429
Well, can I offer you anything?
Some baklava?

111
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,596
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- What?

112
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,210
It's Greek pastry. Try some.

113
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,703
Geek pastry?

114
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,782
No, Greek. It's pretty good.

115
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,118
- Ben?
- Is the bug bomb in the basement?

116
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,595
- I don't know.
- Where is the bug bomb?

117
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,287
Oh, Ben.

118
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,429
- Who's he?
- Oh, he saved my life today.

119
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,128
Darren.

120
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,569
- From Steve Jackson.
- OK.

121
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,402
- Finished it.
- You did?

122
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,703
- I sure did.
- Come on.

123
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,774
Oh, could you please shut the door?

124
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,074
- Thank you.
- Frieda! Frieda! Here's more.

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,818
It's crazy, but your diagram
actually translates

126
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,924
- into some kind of circuit board.
- It does?

127
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,487
<i>- Help. Help. </i>
- Down, Erhart, down!

128
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,463
<i>- Thank you. Thank you. </i>
- This is Heinlein.

129
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,434
- Hello, Heinlein.
<i>- Hello. Hello. </i>

130
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,639
<i>I would like... </i>

131
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,139
<i>... cheese. </i>
- There you go.

132
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,837
See, I put these sentences
into his voice synthesizer.

133
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,175
Sometimes they make sense.

134
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,045
<i>- I would like... </i>
- It smells down here.

135
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,449
- Not right now, Heinlein.
<i>- Go to hell. </i>

136
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,112
I'm busy, Heinlein. Don't bother me,
or I'll turn your voice down.

137
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,918
Oh, that's a good one.

138
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:11,462
All these are mine.
My dad thinks I threw them away.

139
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,360
It's weird. Never could get
into this stuff.

140
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,501
Oh, but don't you wonder
what's out there?

141
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,332
I mean, up in the universe.
On other planets.

142
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,669
You believe everything you see
in the movies?

143
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,107
Not everything.

144
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,344
There's nobody out there.

145
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,916
- Here it is.
- Oh, great.

146
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,915
I tied into my father's computer
on the modem

147
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,721
and filled in some details
on your drawing.

148
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,158
It's mostly guesswork.

149
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,192
This is our circuit board,
which called for a terminal.

150
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,304
So I used my computer,
which is only a 128K,

151
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,839
but that should be enough
to find out what it...

152
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,107
What it does, if it does
anything at all, which it...

153
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,744
Which it probably doesn't.
So you got it?

154
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,183
- Makes sense to me.
- Good.

155
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,380
There's no sense in waiting.
Are you ready?

156
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,546
Sure, I guess.

157
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,125
It'll probably just burn out
or something.

158
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,629
Oh, well.

159
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,139
This kind of stuff usually takes
years and years to develop

160
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,106
and work out the bugs.

161
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,443
What's? What's it doing?

162
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,486
I don't get it.
It's programming itself.

163
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,563
I don't believe this.

164
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,794
It's asking for coordinates
on x-, y- and z-axes

165
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,304
to locate a point in space
relative to its terminal.

166
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,605
How did you dream this?

167
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,446
Guess I'm just that kind of guy.

168
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,606
Well, let's see what happens.

169
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,617
"Confirm. "

170
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,867
What was that?

171
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,100
I have no idea.

172
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,208
There's holes in all these!

173
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,815
I can see through there!

174
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,821
- This is from my dream?
- Calm down, Ben.

175
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,291
There has got to be a logical
explanation for this, a scientific reason.

176
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,987
This is a trick, right, you guys?

177
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,632
Listen, we have got
to swear to secrecy.

178
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,564
If someone finds out about this,
they're gonna try to take it away,

179
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,637
and they can't do that,
because you dreamt it,

180
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,103
I built it, and it's our secret.

181
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,334
- Right?
- Right.

182
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,274
You pull this on every other sucker
that comes in here?

183
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,073
Wolfgang!

184
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,512
Oh, it's my father.

185
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,147
Wolfgang...

186
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,784
...I was sure the bug bomb
was down here somewhere.

187
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,892
Insect byproducts...

188
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,460
Hello. Oh, so this is the new
experiment.

189
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,119
- Yeah. Yeah.
- How's it going?

190
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,526
Oh, it's fine, fine.

191
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,894
Well, with all this equipment...

192
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,434
Is that my video sync generator?

193
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,799
- No, I seriously doubt it, Father.
<i>- Hello. </i>

194
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,941
- Hello, Heinlein.
<i>- Go to hell. </i>

195
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,336
Shut up, Heinlein.

196
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,206
Now that I come to think of it,
I did see some insect waste products

197
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,677
over in that corner, and there
could be some bug bomb.

198
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,316
- Bug bomb?
- Yeah, of course.

199
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,475
- Most definitely in that corner.
- Are you sure?

200
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,951
- Yeah. Yes.
- Good. I remember...

201
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,617
I have to get it running again anyway.
I'll call you tonight.

202
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,228
All right, don't forget.
Good night, Mr. Müller.

203
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,761
<i>Ja. Ja</i>.

204
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,492
Father, now that I come
to think of it, maybe it's...

205
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,128
It's not here.
Frieda, swat them with the broom!

206
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,147
<i>Our speed is diminishing. </i>

207
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,416
<i>We're now in the atmosphere</i>
<i>of Earth. </i>

208
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,522
<i>Where are you going?</i>

209
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,291
<i>Our universe is vast. </i>

210
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,433
<i>Full of wonders. </i>

211
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,893
<i>I'll explore. </i>

212
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,401
<i>Perhaps find another Metaluna. </i>

213
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,939
<i>A place inhabited by beings</i>
<i>not unlike myself. </i>

214
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,546
<i>You see, I'm more adventurous</i>
<i>than you imagined me. </i>

215
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,177
<i>Exeter, you've used all your power</i>
<i>bringing us here. </i>

216
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,787
<i>Even if you had a place to go,</i>
<i>you couldn't make it. </i>

217
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,391
<i>Come with us. </i>
<i>We'll heal your wounds. </i>

218
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,891
<i>I'm afraid my wounds</i>
<i>can never be healed. </i>

219
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,495
<i>You've things to teach us. </i>

220
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,487
<i>Thank you. </i>

221
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,100
<i>We're over your Earth now. </i>
<i>It's time for you to go. </i>

222
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,736
<i>Farewell. </i>

223
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,403
<i>Ben. </i>

224
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,002
<i>Ben?</i>

225
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,002
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey, I got it working again. </i>

226
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,116
<i>Everybody's at the movies. </i>
<i>Get over here right now. </i>

227
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,878
- Well, what is it?
- Jeez.

228
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,419
You know, Ben, you are such
an obsessive person,

229
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,149
and that drives me crazy.
Because you can't get emotional

230
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,021
if you're going to study
anything scientifically.

231
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,529
Now, what we have here,
as near as I can tell...

232
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,831
...is an electrically generated
point of force.

233
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,468
What?

234
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,003
By typing in coordinates, I can make it
move anywhere in three dimensions.

235
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,132
Even as far as slamming it
through a few books or a brick wall.

236
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,234
How?

237
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,949
- This is a vector graphic of the lab.
- You mean a drawing?

238
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,090
Well, yes. But in technical terms,
it's a vector graphic.

239
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,417
OK.

240
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,690
That's where it'll be
when it comes on.

241
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,859
- Where?
- Oh, you mean in physical form.

242
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,472
Oh, well, it's right there
somewhere.

243
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,164
I can't see it.

244
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,113
Sorry, I miscalculated.

245
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,451
I can't see it.

246
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,316
Oh, yeah, I'll fix that.

247
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,093
It's pretty neat, huh?

248
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,457
- Wow.
- Yeah.

249
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,933
Here. I waited for you to get here

250
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,696
so that we could make
the official document.

251
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,506
- Can I touch it?
- Go ahead.

252
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,316
- It's pretty solid.
- Yeah.

253
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,048
- How come we can see it now?
- Power modulation.

254
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,682
See, this variable changes
its diameter.

255
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,790
See, it's a perfect sphere.

256
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,197
- Wanna see it move?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,895
I'll move it from here to there.

258
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,902
Boy. This is pretty weird.

259
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,107
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- Ben, I'm a scientist.

260
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,384
<i>Hello. </i>

261
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,785
Hey, look out!

262
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,858
Oh, my God!

263
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,500
Hey, what the hell's going on
in there?

264
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,501
Darren! Come on, get in here!

265
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,866
It's that thing we found.

266
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,442
It's going crazy.

267
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,513
- You guys weren't kidding.
- No.

268
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,581
Hey, it's destroying the neighborhood!
Get it back in here!

269
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,346
I've tried, OK? I've already tried.

270
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,046
- Can you see it?
- No, I don't see anything.

271
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,657
Come on, get it back in here.

272
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,665
<i>Help. Help. </i>

273
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,308
Watch it!

274
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,094
Damn.

275
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,894
It's gone.

276
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,296
Well, so is most of the basement.

277
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,799
Look at this mess.

278
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,463
Oh, no.

279
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,337
- What now?
- It's my parents. They're back.

280
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,742
If my dad sees all this,
he's gonna stuff me in a test tube.

281
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,575
You guys, sneak out the back,

282
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,309
and we'll continue
testing tomorrow, OK?

283
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,214
This is crazy. I'm not coming home
with the house like this.

284
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,787
Bad kitty.

285
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,657
So, what'd you tell them
about the basement?

286
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,457
I told them it was
a rocketry experiment.

287
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,162
I just mentioned Wernher von Braun,
and everything was OK.

288
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,895
That wouldn't have worked
at my house.

289
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,943
My brother and I used to come
up here all the time.

290
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,714
That was before he went
into his jerk phase.

291
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,318
Boy, you can see the whole town
from up here.

292
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,718
There's Lori's house!

293
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,294
Who's Lori?

294
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,666
She's this gorgeous blond.

295
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,298
- Where's she live?
- Never mind.

296
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:57,332
I made a rough sketch of the terrain
in graphics mode for referencing.

297
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,103
I'm gonna look for something
to experiment with.

298
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,506
Ben...

299
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,409
...don't touch.

300
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,385
Mr. Professor.

301
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,716
It's my dream, and I can
touch it if I want.

302
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,447
Is he always like this?

303
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,685
Just about. I mean, it doesn't
make him so intelligent

304
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,887
just because he has a computer.

305
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,992
I can do it. I mean,
it's not that tough.

306
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,933
That's where it's gonna be
when it comes on.

307
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,269
Can you make it bigger?

308
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,408
Sure.

309
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,808
How do you make it come on?

310
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,243
Like this.

311
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,780
Help! Ben!

312
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,945
- I didn't know it could get that big.
- Get me out!

313
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,751
- Me neither.
- Turn it off, man. Get him out of there.

314
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,353
I'm...

315
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,428
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

316
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,188
It's... It's just not working!

317
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,760
Ben, get me out!

318
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,796
Help!

319
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,437
- Where's he going?
- Where's he going?

320
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,593
This is like <i>Journey to the Center</i>
<i>of the Earth</i>.

321
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,233
Are you crazy?
He's on his way to China!

322
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,515
Wolfgang!
Oh, God, man, I'm sorry!

323
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,019
Are you all right?

324
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,723
I mean, are you OK?

325
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,292
I didn't mean to turn it on.
It just came on.

326
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,486
I couldn't breathe in that thing.

327
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,063
- What was it like?
- Well...

328
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,928
...it was airtight.

329
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,002
I couldn't feel myself speed up
or slow down.

330
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,602
Do you know what this means?

331
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,436
Do you realize what it means?!

332
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,043
No.

333
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:17,272
<i>Trägheitslosigkeit</i>.
That's German for "no inertia".

334
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,349
- No...
- Inertia.

335
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,046
If we had something to sit in,

336
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,816
all three of us could
fly around in this thing.

337
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,595
We could look in top
of the girls' gym.

338
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,296
I have got a great idea.

339
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,703
Oh, no. Ben, no.

340
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,744
Are you serious?

341
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,841
<i>A little higher. </i>

342
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,149
<i>That's it. I can almost see in. </i>

343
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,421
Oh, my God.

344
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,954
There she is.

345
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,919
She won't be undressing this early.

346
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:09,533
She's talking on the phone,
and she's eating some...

347
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,301
It looks like...
It looks like Boston cream pie.

348
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,462
<i>She's got some stuffed animals</i>
<i>on her bed,</i>

349
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,767
<i>and it looks like some</i>
<i>Thompson Twins records. </i>

350
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,808
He's got it bad.

351
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,708
Idiotic.

352
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,511
<i>I can almost read her lips. </i>
<i>Get me closer!</i>

353
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,586
Quick! She'll see me!
Get me down!

354
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,954
Here she comes.

355
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,224
Who is that?

356
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,100
Is that you, Ben?

357
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,167
Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,933
I guess so.

359
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,373
Well, what are you doing
down there?

360
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,908
I saw a cat in your tree,
so I thought I'd get it down.

361
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,546
She wants me. I know she does.

362
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,557
Once we get this built,
how fast will it go?

363
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,185
Well, imagine being in a car
and accelerating from zero to 90

364
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,197
in less than a second.
You'd be instantly squished.

365
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,268
But in this force field,
you have no inertia.

366
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,370
No resistance to acceleration.

367
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,803
You can start, speed up,
stop without slowing down,

368
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,705
and, basically, you won't
get squished.

369
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,311
How fast?

370
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,916
Well, it depends on the amount
of power that you put into it.

371
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,984
Well, to give you an idea,
this is the amount of power

372
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,314
that I'm putting into it right now.

373
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,168
- Who's Roger?
- This old guy.

374
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,606
He won't notice
if we borrow anything.

375
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,809
Do you come here often?

376
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,683
Yeah.

377
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,314
Got my own key.

378
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,352
That's Bozo.

379
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,020
I always come over here at night
to get parts.

380
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,097
So I kept bringing things
to make friends with him.

381
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:25,327
Bones, meat... Nothing ever worked.

382
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,532
Finally, I found out what he likes.

383
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,206
Gum?

384
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,506
He likes gum?

385
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,408
Don't you?

386
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,073
Well, yeah.

387
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,582
I guess.

388
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,246
Doesn't he swallow it?

389
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,323
No.

390
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,222
Bozo's pretty weird.

391
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,430
Maybe someday I'll teach him
how to blow bubbles.

392
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,528
I used to hang out here
when things got bad at home.

393
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,663
Pretty neat, huh?

394
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,468
Oh, yeah.

395
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,341
- I could live here.
- Not me.

396
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,978
There's some old carnival rides
over there.

397
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,252
Bunch of rats live in them.

398
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,049
Well, I mean, we don't have
to go there. Right, Ben?

399
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,493
- Ben?
- Don't worry, he'll find us.

400
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,272
Oh, there you are.

401
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,104
Here's the thing
I thought we could use.

402
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,182
It's beautiful.

403
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,118
She needs a little work.

404
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,126
I think this used to be called
a Tilt-A-Whirl.

405
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,195
Oh, it's perfect!

406
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,398
We can all fit in here too.

407
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,969
Yeah, well...

408
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,703
...how are we gonna
get this thing home?

409
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,202
It's got wheels. We'll roll it.

410
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,180
Turn it around. Turn it around.

411
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,615
Come on.

412
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,523
That's my foot, you idiot.

413
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,288
Sorry.

414
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,705
That's enough. That's enough.

415
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,098
That's all right.

416
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:21,139
Oh, that's enough. That's enough.
No more. It's fine here.

417
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,109
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

418
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,146
- I got a test tomorrow.
- It's so late.

419
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,181
- So do I.
- Mrs. Doyle hates me.

420
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,683
OK.

421
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:35,088
So who would like to tell us something
about carbon dioxide?

422
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,317
Ben.

423
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,295
Carbon dioxide.

424
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,897
That's what you breathe on Mars.

425
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,660
They have dust storms
for months there, you know.

426
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,636
- And...
- Stupid.

427
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,901
And the temperature's 50 below.

428
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,777
And that's what you'd breathe
on Mars.

429
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,177
- What a geek.
- What is he talking about?

430
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,907
And...

431
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,953
- Trisha.
<i>- What?</i>

432
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,720
Carbon dioxide is formed

433
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,660
during respiration, combustion
and decomposition.

434
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,886
Are you crazy? I'm here!

435
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,550
Stop it.

436
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,911
Some of you have not brought in
your field-trip permission slips.

437
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,810
Let me just remind you,
they have to be in by Wednesday.

438
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,543
Now, yesterday we briefly covered
the field of physiology.

439
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,416
Would anyone like to review that
for us today?

440
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,603
Tonight, we launch.

441
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,466
All right.

442
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:48,144
Very good. Not so good. Very good.
Easy test. Very high curve.

443
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,014
Of course, there's always
an exception.

444
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,089
That's three strikes in a row, Woods.
What's the problem here?

445
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,058
- Very good. Very good.
- Just stupid, I guess.

446
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,662
Not so good. Very good.

447
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,962
Don't you feel, I don't know,
like something big is about to happen?

448
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,899
Well, maybe. But, I mean,
we really haven't been

449
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,062
- very scientific about this, you know.
- Wolfgang.

450
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,902
- Well, listen, it might be dangerous.
- Don't you believe in anything?

451
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,010
Have a little faith, will you?

452
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,540
Hey, come on!

453
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,738
- That's not funny.
- All right. Cool it.

454
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,009
I swiped some beer
so we can name it something.

455
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,214
It's good beer.
My dad drinks a lot of it.

456
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,088
Why don't we call it...

457
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,659
We'll call it the <i>Jules Verne</i>.

458
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,764
No, no. We can...

459
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,730
We could call it the <i>Einstein</i>.
Now, that's a great name.

460
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,891
Oh, come on.

461
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,698
Come on. What do you wanna call it,
the <i>Lori Swenson</i>?

462
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,473
Well...

463
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,338
- I have an idea.
- And what's that?

464
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,177
How about the <i>Thunder Road</i>?

465
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,874
- It's from a Bruce Springsteen song.
- It's not bad.

466
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,883
Not bad? It's perfect.

467
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,184
The <i>Thunder Road</i>.

468
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,793
I christen thee the <i>Thunder Road</i>.

469
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,961
The <i>Thunder Road</i>!

470
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,497
- Oh, now it breaks.
- Let's go.

471
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,016
I knew we should have put hinges
on this thing.

472
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,548
- Come on, you got it. Let's go.
- I'm going to take it very easy at first

473
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,717
because something might happen,
and we all could get killed.

474
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,797
Stop talking about getting killed
all the time. It's gonna be great.

475
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,957
Well, what if the ship falls apart, OK?

476
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,568
She won't, she's a good ship.

477
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,796
- Yeah, don't be so paranoid.
- All right, OK, fine.

478
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,873
- Ready?
- Yeah.

479
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,634
Flashlight.

480
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,775
Systems check.

481
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,672
Air pressure.

482
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,615
OK. We're OK there.

483
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,153
Check.

484
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,348
Twelve-volt system.

485
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,822
Check.

486
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,957
- Exterior illumination.
- Check.

487
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,557
And...

488
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,828
...drive system's response.

489
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,165
Oh, wow.

490
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,864
Here's my launch-area graphic.

491
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,067
See, since the <i>Thunder Road</i>'s
inside the field now,

492
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,681
I'm going to plot our movement
relative to an outside stationary point,

493
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,611
which is the creek.

494
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,216
There we are.

495
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,678
- That makes sense.
- OK.

496
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,185
Harness strength.

497
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,814
- Oh, come on, check. Let's go!
- Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

498
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,722
Supplies. We need supplies
before we go any...

499
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,863
- Look. Supplies, check. Supplies.
- Are you nuts?

500
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,660
- Everything.
- Oh, come on, come on.

501
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,028
- Let's go.
- You nut. Are you crazy?

502
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,602
- We need to go. Come on.
- All right. Fine.

503
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,465
- Exterior illumination, off.
- No, no! It'll be cooler if it's on.

504
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,701
Are you? The whole world's
gonna see these lights. I mean...

505
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,277
All right. We'll turn them off
when we get out of the creek.

506
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,073
It'll be cooler.

507
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,081
OK. Fine. Your way. Fine.

508
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,618
- All right, masks on.
- Let's go. Masks on.

509
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,053
OK. We'll be able to talk briefly
after the field is on.

510
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,752
Make sure that you breathe through
these hoses most of the time, all right?

511
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,123
We're gonna run out of oxygen
pretty fast in this thing.

512
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,499
All right, everybody ready?

513
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,603
- Ready.
- Ready.

514
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,331
- Check, check, check.
- Will you stop checking? Let's go!

515
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,202
Let's boogie.

516
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,852
Field, on.

517
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,273
Wow.

518
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,276
OK, let's go...

519
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,080
...down and to the right.

520
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,167
Hardly feels like we're moving at all.

521
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,430
Great suspension on this thing.

522
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,971
It feels like a dream, doesn't it?

523
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,376
I mean, it's all so perfect.

524
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,947
Funny. I never have dreams.

525
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,382
Oh, everybody has dreams.

526
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,984
I don't.

527
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,264
Gee.

528
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,203
I wish I'd gone to the bathroom.

529
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,992
I can't believe this.

530
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,827
We must be going over
100 miles an hour,

531
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,868
and I haven't even used
one-tenth of our power yet.

532
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,595
Wow.

533
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,565
Where should we go?

534
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,368
Where's all the action
on Friday night?

535
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,700
The drive-in.

536
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:29,349
<i>Bloodshed is my life. </i>
<i>Pain, my pleasure. </i>

537
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,890
<i>Now is the time for destruction. </i>

538
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,731
You see them flying there?

539
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,269
That's what they call
a "traveling matte".

540
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,670
How do you know?

541
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,206
All these movies use them.
It's standard.

542
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,812
<i>May the power be with us. </i>
<i>They attack again. </i>

543
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,346
<i>But they will not touch</i>
<i>my Carla. </i>

544
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,951
Oh, <i>Starkiller</i>. This is great.

545
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,821
You mean, you've seen this?

546
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,859
Yeah, the blond guy is Starkiller,

547
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,590
and he spends the whole movie
blowing up aliens.

548
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,229
<i>Carla!</i>

549
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,039
Explosions in space?
It's impossible!

550
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,235
Oh, what do you mean?
You can hardly see the strings.

551
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,811
<i>He was like my father. </i>

552
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,453
<i>Do you see what I mean?</i>

553
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,082
<i>He was my father. </i>

554
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,022
<i>Carla. </i>

555
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,556
<i>Oh, Starkiller. </i>

556
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:51,595
- Wow, does she take her clothes off?
- Yeah, but she's got three navels.

557
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,731
Don't you think we're a little close?

558
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,138
That looks so fake.

559
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,071
We're right in front of the screen.
Get us out of here!

560
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,874
OK.

561
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,358
What's happening?!

562
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,854
- Not so fast! Not too low!
- It's not making any sense!

563
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,357
- Turn us around!
- You're gonna kill us, you idiot!

564
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,160
- Why don't you drive it. I'm trying!
- Turn us around.

565
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,834
- Hey, what's the deal? I gave you a 20.
- It was not.

566
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,030
We're gonna hit that! Hold on!

567
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,877
<i>What the..?</i>

568
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:50,322
<i>Starkiller, you are being</i>
<i>taken from behind. </i>

569
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,360
<i>Burn in hell, alien maggots!</i>

570
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,988
<i>You shall not possess our women,</i>
<i>slime-bred vermin!</i>

571
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,371
Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

572
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,670
- Do you wanna drive?
- Well, yeah.

573
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,609
I heard they were gonna
tear it down anyway.

574
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,416
At least, I think I did.

575
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,246
Well, it's working OK now.
Now let's go back.

576
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,354
- Oh, come on!
- Come on, not yet!

577
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,547
Let's see some more.

578
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,521
Yeah, open her up.
Let's see what she can do.

579
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,751
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

580
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:25,657
- Come on.
- I'd say she's done enough already.

581
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,354
- No, she hasn't...
- Oh, come on.

582
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:28,521
What's that?

583
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,354
OK, Charlie, what do we do now?

584
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,923
We order it down.

585
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,656
Unidentified craft,

586
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,595
you're in direct violation
of controlled airspace.

587
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,633
- What are they saying?
- Probably something like,

588
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,033
- "You're under arrest. "
<i>- I repeat,</i>

589
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,604
<i>you must land immediately. </i>

590
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:16,607
Jesus! Did you see that?

591
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,482
I don't know what I saw, Charlie.

592
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,488
Gordon, there was something inside.
Didn't you see it?!

593
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,856
I swallowed my gum.

594
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:41,429
- That guy saw us for sure.
- Oh, that's just great!

595
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,302
What if he reports us, and the police
come to our house and arrest us?

596
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,638
- Then we'll have a criminal record.
- Big deal.

597
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,173
Even if he did report us,
who's gonna believe him anyway?

598
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,343
It's doing it again!

599
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,282
- What?
- I don't know.

600
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,857
I never programmed
anything like this.

601
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:06,428
I mean, look at it.
It's complete nonsense.

602
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,326
- Well, then where's it coming from?
- I don't know!

603
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,296
- I have no idea!
- Great, the computer's crazy.

604
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:12,333
We're going straight up!

605
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,233
Is it thinking for itself
or taking over the ship, or what?

606
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:18,967
It has to be receiving this stuff from
somewhere else outside the sphere.

607
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,051
- Tell it to turn us around!
- I'm trying to, OK?!

608
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,482
See, "no access".

609
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,961
I don't know what this is
or where it's coming from.

610
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,863
Well, you can still read it, can't you?

611
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:47,163
You guys ready for some
more good news?

612
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:48,737
We're out of air.

613
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,533
We are!

614
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,342
OK, nobody panic.

615
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,612
We have to trick the computer.

616
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,874
I'm going to reverse our x-axis diode.
Hold your ears.

617
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:05,745
I'm turning off the field,
and air's gonna rush in for a second.

618
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,442
- Aren't we still going up?
- No, this is great!

619
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,018
Not only do we have new fresh air,
but I tricked the computer

620
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,315
so it thinks it's going
in the opposite direction

621
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,617
than it actually is. It's great.

622
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,590
- Well, then we're going straight down.
- Well, yeah...

623
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,363
- We're going straight down.
- OK, OK.

624
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,774
Oh, we made it.

625
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:09,545
Oh, we made... Oh, OK.

626
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,881
- Twelve-volt system, off.
- Wait, Wolfgang.

627
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,024
- We're not on the ground.
- And last but not least.

628
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,284
- I've been waiting for this.
- We're not on the ground.

629
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,985
Of course we are!
We're home, we're home!

630
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,391
- Field, off.
- Don't do it!

631
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:31,768
You idiot!

632
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:34,706
You broke my Walkman,
you're dead.

633
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:36,972
Yeah, well, I got us
back down, didn't I?

634
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,013
You sure did.

635
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,981
Wow. It took us right back home.

636
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,064
What's so funny?

637
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,692
That was great!
That was incredible!

638
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,305
Next time...
Next time, we'll bring more air,

639
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:04,873
- Next time?
- And we'll go higher,

640
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,509
and we'll explore.

641
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,475
Listen, Ben, I'm not going to get in
that thing again until we find out

642
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,706
exactly where those programs
were coming from.

643
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:15,318
- And we need to run tests. Yes.
- Wolfgang, come on.

644
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:17,852
We have to run hundreds
upon hundreds of serious tests.

645
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:20,047
You know, it could take years.

646
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,355
What are you talking about?

647
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,053
That was the most important thing
that ever happened!

648
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,859
Couldn't you feel it?
That feeling way inside.

649
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:34,595
- We were flying!
- Come on, Ben, make some sense.

650
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:38,708
- We almost didn't come back.
- But we did come back.

651
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,771
Here we are!

652
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,904
What do you think?

653
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,414
We should trust the dream, right?

654
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,210
Sorry, man. I wanna live.

655
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,157
But we have our own spaceship.

656
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,445
You coming?

657
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:22,916
No.

658
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:26,049
I wanna take another look around.

659
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,885
OK. Catch you later.

660
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:06,887
Johann.

661
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,500
Johann, keep your projectiles
to yourself.

662
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,763
There was quite a lot of activity
in this town last night.

663
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:16,566
There were numerous
UFO sightings.

664
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,907
Many of them at the drive-in,

665
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,879
where the police are trying
to investigate

666
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:27,143
to discover who destroyed
the concession stand.

667
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:30,014
- Wolfgang!
- What?

668
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,379
Your color is not good.

669
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,856
You should not be making
experiments so late.

670
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,922
Oh, by the way,
I found the bug bomb.

671
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,566
- Where was it?
- Where was it?

672
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,497
In the bathroom.

673
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,104
Hey, man, I waited a lifetime
for something like this to happen.

674
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,765
I wanna find out what the hell it was
we saw up there.

675
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:32,913
OK, well, I saw something
down in the creek, and I...

676
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:38,011
I don't know, I can't help it.
Can't you understand that?

677
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,380
All I know is,
this is driving me crazy.

678
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:44,685
Gordon...

679
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,258
Look, man, I've been having
dreams about this lately, and...

680
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,991
Yes, really.

681
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,767
The weird thing is...

682
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,202
...I haven't had dreams like this
since I was a kid.

683
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,548
Lori, it's a dream!

684
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,052
Lori?

685
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,060
Wow!

686
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,787
Is this what your first dream
was like?

687
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:58,128
- Wolfgang, this is a private dream.
- Not anymore.

688
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:00,634
You too?
I thought you never dreamed.

689
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,396
Yeah, so did I.

690
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,337
But wait a minute. Don't you see?
We're all here.

691
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,136
There must be a reason for this.

692
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,336
There's always a reason
when you dream.

693
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,644
What are these, drive-ins?

694
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,748
See, there's the diagram!

695
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,859
And there's a missing part
in the center.

696
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,051
We have to remember it

697
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,595
and then figure it out
when we go up again.

698
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,313
<i>Wolfgang. </i>

699
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,718
I just had a dream
weirder than yours.

700
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,850
Did you get the diagram?

701
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:58,484
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

702
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,564
What's going on here?

703
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,230
We both had the same dream.

704
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:13,002
See, it's a smaller circuit board
that fits onto the original circuit board.

705
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,667
Like this...

706
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,205
- Turn it on.
- OK.

707
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,384
What is that stuff?

708
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:28,457
It's... It's oxygen!

709
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,526
- It's our oxygen!
- Well, turn it off, stupid.

710
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,503
I had it turned up a little too high.

711
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,766
But that's OK. We can still go.

712
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,807
Finally.

713
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,135
You feel it too.

714
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,011
Yeah.

715
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,043
It's ever since the dream last night.

716
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:58,015
Let's face it, somebody's calling us.

717
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,486
They've been calling us
since the beginning.

718
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,954
But from where?

719
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,185
I don't know,
but it's somewhere up there.

720
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,690
Well, I guess we have
to find out, right?

721
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,026
Well, they got us this far.

722
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,568
It's like we're supposed to go.

723
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,334
Well...

724
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,135
...let's go.

725
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,975
Before my dad sees his work shed.

726
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,446
Ben, are you using my tweezers again
on one of your models?

727
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,482
- No.
- Honey, what are you doing?

728
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,479
I'm writing a letter to Grandma.

729
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,555
Well, good.

730
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:45,824
- Mom.
- Yeah?

731
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,864
You remember that stuff
you were telling me

732
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,432
about your dreams
and doing what you wanna do?

733
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:56,163
Well, if I really want to be an astronaut
and go out in space

734
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,934
and really do that,
it'd be OK, right?

735
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,669
Sure, honey, if that's
what you really wanna do.

736
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,005
OK.

737
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:09,678
- Sleep tight.
- Yeah, good night.

738
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,982
Bye, Mom.

739
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,771
Hiya, kid.

740
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,272
- So you're the spaceman.
- What?

741
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,103
Hey, listen.

742
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:37,246
- Is this your jacket?
- Where'd you get that?

743
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:41,078
You were in that UFO, weren't you?

744
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,014
Weren't you?

745
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,347
Hey, weren't you in there?!

746
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,445
We gotta get out of here!
Some guy knows about it!

747
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:12,138
What? Who?

748
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,148
Some guy, he tried to grab me
outside my house.

749
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,979
He's probably on his way
over here right now.

750
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:18,587
So we'll kick his butt.

751
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,966
OK, let's get out of here.

752
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,228
OK. I have to regulate
the air pressure first, OK?

753
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,803
Can't you do that
when we're up there?

754
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,463
No, I can't, Ben. Now,
you're getting on my nerves.

755
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,869
What's that?

756
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,405
Something my dad gave me,
do you mind?

757
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,449
No, it's fine. Fine.
Just put it out of the way.

758
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,183
Nice going, kid.

759
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,329
All right!

760
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,469
- So, what happens now?
- I'll take us up higher and...

761
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,194
And then they'll contact us, I guess.

762
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,518
I can't stop thinking
about what's up there.

763
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,315
I mean, what kind of life?

764
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:04,153
You mean, will it be some
kind of slimy blob?

765
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,817
It could be anything.

766
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,898
I mean, it could be pure energy,
or it could be thought waves.

767
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,294
I mean, I don't know.

768
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,163
It could be something
we can't even imagine.

769
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:16,197
How about a planet full
of Amazon women

770
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,500
who wanna breed a new race?

771
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,269
- You pervert.
- Oh, come on, you guys.

772
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,103
You'll see. It'll be great.

773
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,838
It'll be the greatest thing ever.

774
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,253
They're here.

775
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,225
See, they're taking over.

776
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:50,265
- Wow, what was that?
- What happened?

777
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,102
- Where are we?
- Oh, my God.

778
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,920
Eaten alive.

779
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,662
- What if we wanna go back?
- Go back?

780
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,424
Now you say this?

781
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,728
Why don't you look around,
it's a little too late!

782
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,393
Will you shut up?

783
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,506
It'll be all right. Just don't spoil it.

784
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:29,574
We are going where no man
has gone before,

785
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:33,249
to unlock the secrets
of the universe.

786
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,716
It's pretty incredible.

787
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,250
Think about it.

788
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,174
The field's off.

789
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,917
Well, guys, we're on our own now.

790
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,783
Don't worry.

791
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:16,254
It's all part of the plan.

792
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,071
Look at this place.

793
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,058
Ride's over.

794
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,988
- I guess we should get out now, huh?
- Are you crazy?

795
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:00,532
We can't just sit here.
They're expecting us.

796
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:03,332
Exactly. I'm staying right here.

797
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,033
If they give us any trouble,
we'll kick their butt.

798
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:09,176
What? What the hell's this?

799
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:18,714
- Let's go.
- We really have to get out.

800
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,651
Let's get out of here.

801
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:26,928
Hello.

802
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:35,067
We're all radioactive now.

803
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,899
Our DNA's all... screwed up,

804
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,635
and our kids will have tentacles.

805
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,879
Dark in here.

806
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,912
Maybe they don't have eyes.

807
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,451
Think we'll enjoy living here?

808
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,619
I wonder what they're waiting for.

809
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:01,958
I mean, they must've been preparing
for this for thousands of years.

810
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,060
Maybe they're not hungry yet.

811
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,064
- Where's Darren?
- Look out!

812
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,055
Darren!

813
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,928
Where is he?

814
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:40,333
Darren!

815
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:03,048
There must be some
kind of mistake.

816
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:04,488
Mistake, my foot!

817
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:06,822
They're testing us
like mice in a maze.

818
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,362
- Don't be such a downer.
- I'm serious!

819
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,261
Ben? Hey, Ben. Ben, wait up!

820
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,071
Ben.

821
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,107
Ben, what was that sound?

822
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,275
I don't know.

823
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:09,060
Wolfgang!

824
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,846
Wolfgang!

825
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,455
Ben!

826
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,058
Darren!

827
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,556
Are you OK?

828
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,491
That was weird.

829
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,999
You were in a trance or something.

830
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,070
- Where's Wolfgang?
- I don't know.

831
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,638
I lost him. I...
This thing came...

832
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,038
Well, then let's go find him
and get out of here.

833
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,468
I don't know how it works,

834
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,807
but it puts pictures in your head.

835
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,314
I saw that dream we had and
a whole bunch of other weird stuff.

836
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,045
That sounds just like
in <i>Forbidden Planet. </i>

837
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,849
They had this brain-booster machine.

838
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:10,821
Maybe that's how they got
into my dreams.

839
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:21,335
It smells in here.

840
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:29,204
I hate to say this,

841
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:32,678
but this isn't the way
I thought it would be at all.

842
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,714
It smells in here.

843
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,852
You just said that.

844
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,977
No, I didn't.

845
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:40,713
What?

846
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,251
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

847
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,260
Where'd he go?

848
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,224
We scared him!

849
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:54,632
Scared him?

850
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:57,270
Yeah. To him, we're the aliens.

851
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,772
To him, we might...
We might be horrible.

852
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:01,432
Horrible? Us?

853
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:06,477
Come on. He couldn't
have gotten far.

854
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,156
Hello!

855
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:16,953
Don't be scared!

856
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,991
Ben, wait a minute.

857
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,395
We gotta find him.

858
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,985
I've waited all my life to say this.

859
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:50,425
Be my guest.

860
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,128
We come in peace.

861
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:10,436
Great. Now try, "How do we
get back to our ship?"

862
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,604
No, no, just give him a minute.

863
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,012
He's probably just translating
in his head.

864
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,310
See, if we can communicate,

865
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:19,114
he can give us the answers
to anything.

866
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,449
He's about to say something.

867
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,157
Eh, what's up, doc?

868
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,654
What?

869
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,701
OK, but let's face it.

870
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:35,360
This energy field of yours,
it's quite extraordinary,

871
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:37,335
but it still needs a lot of work.

872
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,737
Talk about bumpy rides.

873
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:41,501
You'd think that
a technology this advanced

874
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,646
could stabilize
such a simple computer.

875
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:49,884
I never tire of looking
at the stars, do you?

876
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:55,446
Did you know that the light
that we see now

877
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,855
actually began eons ago?

878
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:02,054
They always make me feel
so romantic.

879
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,328
Do you have...

880
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,628
...a girlfriend...

881
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,668
...on Earth?

882
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:12,063
A girlfriend?

883
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,000
Well, I mean, of course
I've got a girlfriend.

884
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,237
No one special.

885
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:23,277
I'm not tied down,
if that's what you mean.

886
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,886
It's... It's probably...
Probably not English.

887
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:35,861
It's just an alien language
that sounds like English.

888
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,298
Remember this one?

889
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,064
<i>Oh, a horse is a horse</i>
<i>Of course, of course</i>

890
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,071
<i>And no one can talk</i>
<i>To a horse, of course</i>

891
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,937
<i>That is, of course</i>
<i>Unless the horse</i>

892
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,805
<i>Is the famous Mister Ed</i>

893
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,241
Everybody!
<i>Right to the source</i>

894
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:53,006
<i>And ask the horse... </i>

895
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:55,082
Nobody's singing.

896
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:56,240
Wolfgang?

897
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,019
Hi, guys.

898
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:02,282
- Where you been?
- Looking for you.

899
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,825
We were worried about you!

900
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:08,225
Do you have any consideration
for your friends?

901
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:21,304
This is Neek.

902
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:25,575
And... And, Neek,
that's Darren and Ben.

903
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,647
Hello.

904
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:34,748
Hi.

905
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,624
Hi, yourself.

906
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:42,457
We've been looking
all over for you.

907
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:47,160
And now you're just lounging
around with some alien, and...

908
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,667
And communicating.

909
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,138
Ben.

910
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,505
She's incredibly intelligent.

911
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,575
Besides...

912
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:01,012
...I think she kind of likes me.

913
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:03,340
Wak.

914
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,352
What?

915
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:08,121
Wak.

916
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,985
- Quack? Wa?
- Wak!

917
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:17,055
Wak's your name!
That's... That's your name.

918
01:17:18,768 --> 01:17:21,862
- I'm Ben. Me, Ben.
- Me, Tarzan.

919
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:34,815
What do I have to do,
eat a banana?

920
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,509
- You get it, don't you?
- No, I...

921
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,655
Come on, jump in!

922
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:46,589
They know all about us.
It's from watching this stuff.

923
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,286
Neek.

924
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:49,988
You see. Look.

925
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,381
TV?

926
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,052
They get TV up here?

927
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:20,489
Just waves in space.
They're crazy about it.

928
01:18:20,663 --> 01:18:22,961
<i>Yes, folks, there is life</i>
<i>in outer space!</i>

929
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,566
<i>And here he comes,</i>
<i>the life of outer space himself. </i>

930
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:27,896
<i>Let's make him feel at home,</i>
<i>here's Wak. </i>

931
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,697
Do you know me?

932
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:32,669
Often, when I enter a hotel
or restaurant,

933
01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:34,605
people fail to recognize me.

934
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,074
Thank you, thank you,
you're great.

935
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:38,836
Let's start tonight's show
with a medley of your favorites.

936
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,447
Remember this one?

937
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,208
The amazing Kitchen Companion!

938
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,046
It slices, dices, minces, quinces.

939
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,382
Even makes french fries,
shoestring or crinkle-cut.

940
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,989
But wait, that's not all!

941
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:51,786
Make hundreds of julienne carrots
in just seconds.

942
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:53,758
One tomato lasts a month!

943
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:55,556
No more tears cutting onions!

944
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:58,761
How much would you expect to pay
for this unbelievable kitchen miracle

945
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,232
that makes all previous forms
of kitchen appliances

946
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,734
completely obsolete?

947
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,702
Fifty dollars?

948
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,669
One hundred dollars?

949
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,833
- One thousand dollars?
- What do you think?

950
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:10,774
Well, it's great...

951
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:13,875
But... Well...

952
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:17,485
- I mean, is it just me, or?
- What? What's the matter?

953
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:20,053
They don't make any sense.

954
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:23,481
That's the way they think
that we talk.

955
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,886
Order now, get the set
of stainless-steel steak knives

956
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:29,326
and the miracle paring knife,
absolutely free!

957
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:35,363
Anyway, my wife gave me a new car.

958
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,699
It's called a Rolls Canhardly.

959
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,536
That's right, rolls down one hill,
can hardly get up the next.

960
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,506
A Rolls Canhardly, get it?

961
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:56,324
The train, the train!

962
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,357
Now, for the first time
on our show...

963
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:03,831
...the Flying Serrento Brothers.

964
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:05,728
Now, as you know,
the Flying Serrento Brothers

965
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,698
were supposed to be
on last week's show.

966
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:11,067
Unfortunately, four of them
are in critical condition.

967
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,466
So this evening,
we are proud to present

968
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,906
the Flying Serrento Brother.

969
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,973
But first, before that,
I'd like to introduce

970
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,547
four lads from Liverpool.

971
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:23,048
The Beatles, but before The Beatles...

972
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:29,519
You must be proud to be
from such a wonderful place.

973
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,589
You mean Earth?

974
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:35,720
No, no more, no more.
Please, please.

975
01:20:35,898 --> 01:20:38,128
My heart, my heart.

976
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,769
- No, no, please.
- Earth, huh?

977
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,063
All right, all right.

978
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,400
OK, now, I'd like a little
assistance from the audience.

979
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,235
If someone would like
to come up and help me.

980
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,900
Anyone? You, son. Yes.

981
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,841
Great. Could you come on-stage
for just a minute, please?

982
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,539
That's right.

983
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:57,584
Right up here next to me.
What's your name, son?

984
01:20:57,753 --> 01:21:00,085
- Ben.
- Ben. Ben. Where you from?

985
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:02,053
- Earth.
- Earth. Anybody here from Earth?

986
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:04,021
Earth, see?
You got all friends here today.

987
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,855
I'd like you to do me a little favor,
if you will. Would you do that?

988
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,758
- Sure.
- I'd like to improve my reception,

989
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:11,661
so would you raise
my antenna for me?

990
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:14,600
Not that one, Ben.
Not that one, thank you.

991
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,362
- These?
- Yeah, that's right.

992
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,438
All right, move it a little to the right

993
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,700
and out a little further.

994
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,904
Feels good.

995
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,340
Better, Ben.

996
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:25,775
OK, that's pretty good.

997
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,542
Oh, great. Thank you very much.

998
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,311
Well, get away, son.
You bother me.

999
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,422
- Excuse me?
- Get away, boy. Off. Off.

1000
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,852
Kids.

1001
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:39,756
Kids all over the world,
they only understand one thing.

1002
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,021
<i>All around the world</i>

1003
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,292
<i>Rock 'n' roll is all they play</i>

1004
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:50,739
<i>All around the world</i>

1005
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,069
<i>Rock 'n' roll is all they play</i>

1006
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,536
<i>All the flat-topped cats</i>
<i>With their rock 'n' roll queens</i>

1007
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:01,774
<i>Just a-rocking and a-rolling</i>

1008
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:03,782
<i>In their red and blue jeans</i>

1009
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,354
<i>All around the world</i>

1010
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:08,490
<i>Rock 'n' roll is here to stay</i>

1011
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,251
<i>Then hear those jukebox jumping</i>

1012
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,489
<i>All night and all through the day</i>

1013
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:21,598
<i>Ain't never no time for romance</i>

1014
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,567
<i>They only wanna dance</i>

1015
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:25,604
<i>The people all holler</i>
<i>When they hit the floor</i>

1016
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,935
<i>Go, cat, go</i>

1017
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,975
<i>All around the world</i>

1018
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:33,171
<i>Rock 'n' roll is here to stay</i>

1019
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,779
<i>You can hear those jukebox jumping</i>

1020
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,615
<i>All night and all through the day</i>

1021
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,336
<i>They do the bop</i>

1022
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:01,074
<i>The Texas Hop</i>

1023
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:02,972
<i>Shim, sham, shimmy</i>

1024
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,579
<i>And they never, never stop</i>

1025
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,746
<i>All around the world</i>

1026
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:11,477
<i>Rock 'n' roll is here to stay</i>

1027
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:15,718
<i>You can hear those jukebox jumping</i>

1028
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:18,587
<i>All night and all through the day</i>

1029
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:26,001
Thank you. Thank you.
You're beautiful.

1030
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,228
You're wonderful.
You're wonderful. Thank you.

1031
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,135
I get it.

1032
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,903
Your people have been
visiting our planet for...

1033
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:39,138
Well, since ancient times.

1034
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,782
And now you've come back
to check up on us.

1035
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,781
And... And explain everything, right?

1036
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:47,615
It's a very interesting story.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

1037
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,690
Are you aware of that?

1038
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,294
Actually, they've never been
down there in person.

1039
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:55,327
- There's too many germs.
- Germs!

1040
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,627
Germs!

1041
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,134
Germs that can cause colds,
bad breath, diarrhea.

1042
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:07,241
Germs that can flourish
in your family bathroom.

1043
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:12,440
See, they had to disinfect us when
we got here just to get this close.

1044
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:16,482
Besides, we know what they do
to people like us down there.

1045
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:24,975
But... But this is just the movies.

1046
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,456
This isn't the way we really are.

1047
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:31,924
- Don't you know that?
- You expect me to believe that?

1048
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:35,530
Look at this, your people
just like to blow things up.

1049
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:38,359
Look... Look, we...

1050
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:41,469
We sent out those signals
because we wanted to meet.

1051
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,696
But it had to be someone special.

1052
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,533
You!

1053
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:48,232
So... So you could explain.

1054
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:52,877
You're not like the rest of them.
You knew we could be friends...

1055
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,545
...if we only got the chance.

1056
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:02,222
Look, I know I must look weird to you,
but how do you think you look to me?

1057
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:04,052
Listen, I watched
four episodes of <i>Lassie</i>

1058
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:07,024
before I figured out why
the little hairy kid never spoke!

1059
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:10,264
I mean, he rolled over.
Sure, he did that fine,

1060
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,525
but I didn't think he deserved
a series for that.

1061
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:18,273
But, see, this isn't real.

1062
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,500
And... And we don't really kill people.

1063
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:25,169
Well, we do, but... But not aliens,
because we haven't met any.

1064
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:36,985
What's that?

1065
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:39,389
Space pirates.

1066
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:41,919
Space pirates?

1067
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,336
Space pirates.

1068
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,532
- Scourge of the universe.
- We can fight them off!

1069
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,769
- Vicious! Merciless!
- We'll stand together.

1070
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:59,573
- We'll use your advanced weaponry!
- They crush all who defy them.

1071
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:03,240
Coming to a theater near you.
Rated R.

1072
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,317
Good night, everybody.

1073
01:27:05,487 --> 01:27:09,048
<i>- Thanks for the memories... </i>
- There she is.

1074
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,260
Go home?

1075
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,125
We can't go home.
We just got here.

1076
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:19,995
And we're sorry you have
to run along so soon.

1077
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,295
Aren't they great?
Let's give them a big sendoff.

1078
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:25,634
I tell you, I love this guy.
I really do. I mean that sincerely.

1079
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:28,173
Now, remember, you can see him
at Tahoe the week of the 17th

1080
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,504
and Atlantic City on Easter weekend.
Isn't that right?

1081
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,704
Let's all try to be there.

1082
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:34,610
Tahoe?

1083
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:37,709
- What's the hurry?
- Now, look, honey,

1084
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:39,877
let's not have a scene.

1085
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:41,955
I don't understand.
See, we came all this way,

1086
01:27:42,124 --> 01:27:45,855
- and we haven't learned anything.
- Perhaps next time.

1087
01:27:46,028 --> 01:27:47,393
Next time?

1088
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,224
Yes, next time, you get to compete
for our grand prize:

1089
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:52,924
A fabulous, new Pontiac Firebird!

1090
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,661
It's a brand-new car!

1091
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,139
We're not afraid of space pirates.

1092
01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:01,674
I don't understand
why we have to go.

1093
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:02,935
We can take it.

1094
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,740
- I really like it here.
- We get beat up all the time at home.

1095
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:09,247
Y'all come back now, hear?

1096
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,480
But you can't just send us away.

1097
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,451
What is it?
Did we do something wrong?

1098
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,615
Is that it? I mean,
we laughed at all your jokes.

1099
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,852
I mean, even the really dumb ones.

1100
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:21,996
I... I don't know.

1101
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:24,666
What is it you want?

1102
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,865
Looks like my baby picture.

1103
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:45,977
It's '80s music. It's cool.

1104
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:49,512
Far-out.

1105
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:51,855
<i>Far-out?</i>

1106
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:59,057
Oh, Wak.

1107
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,667
Is that a space pirate?

1108
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,834
Yes!

1109
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:17,644
No. Not exactly.

1110
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:08,359
It's their father.

1111
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,534
What?

1112
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,901
I'm telling you, it's their father.
They're kids.

1113
01:30:15,377 --> 01:30:16,503
No way.

1114
01:30:17,446 --> 01:30:19,471
Well, look at him.

1115
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,944
Just a couple of kids?

1116
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,418
And you didn't tell us?

1117
01:30:28,056 --> 01:30:30,581
You dreamed about meeting us.

1118
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,783
You wanted this to be so great.

1119
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:36,761
We were afraid you'd be,
you know, disappointed.

1120
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:40,297
And wouldn't wanna
come back again.

1121
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:42,660
- Really?
- It's true.

1122
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:45,636
It really is his vehicle.

1123
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:49,072
And we're not even
supposed to touch it.

1124
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:52,880
- What a bummer.
- You stole your dad's car?

1125
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:54,515
Well, he said we could
get away with it!

1126
01:30:54,683 --> 01:30:56,310
- But we did.
- But we didn't!

1127
01:30:56,485 --> 01:30:57,952
- We practically did!
- Well, we didn't!

1128
01:30:58,119 --> 01:30:59,814
Well, you're such a wimp anyway.

1129
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,366
Boy. He's really pissed.

1130
01:31:14,703 --> 01:31:16,330
That's why you have to go.

1131
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,268
He'd never understand.

1132
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,635
Especially about us, Wolfgang.

1133
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:30,312
Well, I...

1134
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:33,577
I think it's time for you guys
to get going.

1135
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,084
Do we have to?

1136
01:31:39,261 --> 01:31:43,561
Yeah. And we didn't even get to tell
you the secrets of the universe.

1137
01:31:43,732 --> 01:31:44,892
Ben.

1138
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:51,605
This is for you.

1139
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:55,576
- What is it?
- The...

1140
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:58,838
...stuff that dreams are made of.

1141
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:02,278
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1142
01:32:02,784 --> 01:32:05,082
I must have something
to give you.

1143
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:19,592
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Hubba-hubba.

1144
01:32:21,236 --> 01:32:23,704
Boy, I'd like to get my cups on her.

1145
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,605
Someday she'll be my girlfriend.

1146
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:28,766
Maybe sooner than you think.

1147
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:30,104
What's this?

1148
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:32,371
It's... It's a harmonica.

1149
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,139
You put it in your mouth.

1150
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,844
Yeah, and see, you blow...

1151
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,685
No.

1152
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,581
No, you can't play it
very well like that.

1153
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:46,784
Way to go, stupid.

1154
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:52,491
- It's OK.
- Doesn't even offer me any.

1155
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,247
We'll always have Paris.

1156
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:10,748
Paris? Paris?

1157
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:13,911
Bye-bye!

1158
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:46,686
Boy, and I thought
my dad was tough.

1159
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:52,489
<i>I've waited all my life to say this. </i>

1160
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:54,492
<i>What do I have to do,</i>
<i>eat a banana?</i>

1161
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:57,393
<i>And... And, Neek,</i>
<i>that's Darren and Ben. </i>

1162
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,192
<i>Hello. </i>

1163
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:01,267
<i>A Rolls Canhardly!</i>

1164
01:34:01,436 --> 01:34:03,267
<i>All around the world</i>

1165
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:06,168
<i>- What's that?</i>
<i>- Space pirates. </i>

1166
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:09,037
<i>I'm telling you, it's their father. </i>
<i>They're kids. </i>

1167
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:11,337
<i>- Pretty cute, huh?</i>
<i>- Hubba-hubba. </i>

1168
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:13,777
<i>I think it's time for you guys</i>
<i>to get going. </i>

1169
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:15,074
<i>Do we have to?</i>

1170
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,775
<i>And we're sorry you have</i>
<i>to run along so soon. </i>

1171
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:19,351
<i>Go home?</i>

1172
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:21,318
<i>We can't go home. </i>
<i>We just got here. </i>

1173
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,013
<i>Y'all come back now, hear?</i>

1174
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:25,022
<i>We were flying!</i>

1175
01:34:25,193 --> 01:34:27,161
<i>So you're the spaceman. </i>

1176
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,989
<i>This is for you. </i>

1177
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,758
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- The... </i>

1178
01:34:31,933 --> 01:34:34,424
<i>... stuff that dreams are made of. </i>

1179
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:42,408
- Oh, there's the drive-in.
- What's left of it.

1180
01:34:42,577 --> 01:34:44,169
Oh, yeah.

1181
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,677
- Oh, there's the Safeway.
- Oh, yeah.

1182
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:52,085
There's my house.

1183
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,751
My dad's up.
Wonder what he's doing.

1184
01:35:00,295 --> 01:35:02,957
It's taking us back
to our point of origin.

1185
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:05,430
No, it's not.

1186
01:35:07,302 --> 01:35:08,701
Field's off.

1187
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:11,100
Well, then what's holding us up?

1188
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:31,953
Come on.

1189
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,901
She was a good ship.

1190
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,617
Goodbye.

1191
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:40,776
It's weird.

1192
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:42,946
They should've called us by now.

1193
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,988
What if we never hear
from them again?

1194
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:46,217
I know.

1195
01:37:46,394 --> 01:37:47,986
We gotta get back there somehow.

1196
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:50,096
But we don't have our ship.

1197
01:37:50,265 --> 01:37:51,926
No power.

1198
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,400
It's just so frustrating.

1199
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,199
No one on Earth is ever
gonna top Neek.

1200
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,239
Gee, I thought they really liked us.

1201
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:04,902
I wonder what they're doing
right now.

1202
01:38:05,947 --> 01:38:07,608
Come on, let's go.

1203
01:38:07,782 --> 01:38:11,081
They've probably been grounded
for 3 million years.

1204
01:38:30,805 --> 01:38:34,104
...so mostly it's used to coat
other metals that rust,

1205
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:38,041
or mixed with other metals
to form alloys.

1206
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:42,672
Who was the scientist that discovered
nickel as an element?

1207
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:44,549
Ben.

1208
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,344
Nickel.

1209
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:53,392
- Thomas Jefferson?
- What a bonehead.

1210
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:55,961
- Trisha.
- Baron Axel Frederik Cronstedt

1211
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:59,657
- in 1751.
- Very good, Trisha.

1212
01:39:00,568 --> 01:39:01,694
Nickel is one of...

1213
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,547
All right. They're sending again.

1214
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:29,121
- I knew they would.
- Whoa, dude.

1215
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:33,090
Wow. This one looks
really complicated.

1216
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:40,657
Ben.

1217
01:41:10,932 --> 01:41:12,991
If this is all a dream,

1218
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:15,158
then what happens
when we wake up?

1219
01:41:15,336 --> 01:41:18,897
I don't know,
but I can't wait to find out.

1220
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:31,544
A guy goes to a psychiatrist,
has a complete examination.

1221
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:32,736
Afterwards the shrink says,

1222
01:42:32,914 --> 01:42:35,314
"Well, I've examined you thoroughly.
I've come to my conclusion.

1223
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:36,814
"I think you're crazy!"

1224
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:39,350
And the guys says,
"Well, I want a second opinion. "

1225
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,489
And the shrink says,
"All right. I think you're ugly too. "

1226
