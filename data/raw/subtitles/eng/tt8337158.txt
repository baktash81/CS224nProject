16
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:55,203
Yeah! That's how
you do it, champ.

Belt, they dominated the sport...</i>

- Hey, Fred!
- Hiya, Winnie!

31
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:57,962
Your new tentacle sign
looks amazing.

32
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:01,531
Thanks, Winnie!
It's in honor of Tentacular!

33
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:03,271
- Pretty clever, huh?
- I love it.

34
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:05,360
- Stoker!
- Stoker.

35
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:07,362
- Stoker!
- Stoker!

36
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:09,582
- Stoker!
- Stoker... Aah!

37
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:12,063
- Wha...
- Stoker!

38
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:14,413
Stoker!

39
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:16,589
- Wait!
- See you up there, Fred.

40
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:19,244
Yep! Oh, I hope we win.

41
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,859
Tentacular! Tentacular!

42
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:28,862
Tentacular! Tentacular!

43
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,182
Wish you were here
today, Dad.

44
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,453
- Live in five, Mr. Remy.
- All right, ready?

45
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:00,851
<i>Slime Zone ticket

46
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,331
- Hey, Winnie.
- Hey, Susie. Up top.

47
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,246
Bring it.

48
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,641
Oh! Oh, yeah!
This is gonna be awesome.

49
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,121
- Whoop! Oh, sorry.
- Hey, Winnie!

50
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,142
Pineapple-slaw dog with
extra ketchup coming at ya!

51
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,082
Yes! Thank you, Hoppy.

52
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:20,914
Fifteen dollars.
That's 22.54. Two for 25.

53
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:25,440
There's enough for everyone. Calm down.
Everybody, please be patient.

54
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,181
Hey, Mom! Coming in hot.

55
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,836
Oh. Thanks, Win.
Been a while since we've been this busy.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,273
- See you in the stands, Mom.
- That's 25 even.

57
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:34,319
Coach Siggy,
as Jimbo's assistant,

58
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,626
you were such a huge part
of Stoker's wrestling history.

59
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,411
Now you have a chance to make
your own with Tentacular.

60
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:41,674
But first, you gotta beat
the champ tonight.

61
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:43,589
King Gorge was
a great champ.

62
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,679
<i>But he's never fought
anyone like Tentacular.</i>

63
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:49,203
Oh, man!
Siggy wants this in the worst way.

64
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,466
No, way, bro.
Two rounds, and it's over.

65
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,251
It's gonna be Tentacular
in the third.

66
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,427
Dude,
that's Winnie Coyle!

67
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,908
- You know it.
- Jimbo's daughter?

68
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,519
- No way, bro.
- You got this.

69
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:01,651
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Winnie.

70
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:03,391
Wearing
your lucky socks?

71
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,045
Going on
three weeks now.

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,007
Smells like... victory!

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,340
World Monster
Wrestling presents

74
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,430
The Smackdown in Stoker!

75
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,347
Live from Stoker-on-Avon,
I'm Marc Remy,

76
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,871
welcoming you at home

77
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,177
to the biggest night of
monster wrestling in years,

78
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:53,572
right here in the house
that Rayburn and Jimbo built.

79
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:55,356
And I'm
Lights Out McGinty,

80
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,359
and I could not be more excited.

81
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:01,362
But with that excitement
comes some sadness, Marc.

82
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,800
I can't believe
it's been nine years

83
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,672
since we tragically lost
Rayburn and Jimbo.

84
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,153
Nobody was greater.
We all miss them.

85
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:12,547
Rayburn! Jimbo!

86
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,681
Just listen to this crowd.
Boy, this is special!

87
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,728
Jimbo! Rayburn! Oh!

88
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:21,252
But now
we are moments away

89
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:23,558
from seeing
if Tentacular can bring

90
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:26,736
the glory days
back to Stoker.

91
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:31,175
Welcome, monster wrestling fans
from every corner of the globe.

92
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:35,483
For tonight, we wrestle
for the Big Belt!

93
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,704
- Yeah!
- Stoker!

94
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:42,839
And now,
from Stoker-on-Avon,

95
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,755
the hometown hero,

96
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,887
the challenger,

97
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,196
Tentacular!

98
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,460
Yeah!
Light 'em up!

99
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,596
- The new pride of Stoker...
- Oh, yeah!

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,250
...is in the house!

101
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:06,079
He's ready.
Look at him go.

102
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,559
Do it for Stoker, T!

103
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:10,344
Just listen to that passion.

104
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,781
Yeah! Tentacular!

105
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:15,654
I've got your whole life story
tattooed on my body!

106
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:19,440
Whoa, whoa. I hope you saved room
for the win I'm gonna have tonight.

107
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:24,141
He just tore through the
Western Division to set up this match.

108
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:27,405
- Cheese!
- Yes, sir. He sure did.

109
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,365
- Who wants a selfie? I do!
- Oh, yeah!

110
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,932
Hey-o!

111
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,978
I'm so pretty!

112
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,634
Look at those muscles!

113
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:43,464
The guy's traps are busting
out of his neck, Marc.

114
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,989
Yeah, T! Pop those pecs!

115
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,730
Come on, come get
some of this. Here I am.

116
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,384
Uh-huh!

117
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,735
Here comes the king.

118
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,870
Sixty-two feet
of pure pain.

119
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:03,049
The slimy limey!
The no-bull British bulldog!

120
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:07,227
King Gorge!

121
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:11,710
Boo!

122
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:14,278
Bow to your king.

123
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:17,716
- Bad dog! Bad dog!
- You're going down, Gorge!

124
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,938
Listen to the crowd.
They are heated!

125
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,418
This home crowd
does not like the king.

126
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,378
- No one's bowing in this stadium.
- Boo! Boo!

127
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,694
Ladies
and gentlemen and monsters!

128
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:44,743
Let's get ready to rumble!

129
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:47,224
I am so ready for this.

130
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:48,790
You ready?
Who needs a stress ball?

131
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,967
You look stressed, Maddie.
Here's a stress ball.

132
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,665
I got you. Take a stress ball.

133
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,147
And this championship
match is officially under...

134
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,845
This is awesome!
Spectacular! Electrifying!

135
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,760
Whatever word
you wanna come up with!

136
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,544
Okay.
Breathe, Fred. Breathe.

137
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,459
There it is:
the Inverted Cloverleaf.

138
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,592
Siggy got that
right out of Dad's playbook.

139
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,550
He might have this, Fred.

140
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:11,964
Come on. I'm not watching.
I'm watching, but I'm not watching.

141
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,728
Oh, wake up, ref!

142
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,948
That's a gill gouge, again!

143
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:19,604
What is he doing?
He's gotta stick to the plan!

144
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:24,087
Gorge is doing the Irish Whip into the
Flying Right-Hook Lariat every time!

145
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,828
Come on, T.
Don't let him get the...

146
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,395
Watch that Elbow Smash!

147
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,745
Tentacular came in
to this match the hot favorite.

148
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,270
But the wily old champ,
he's got some other ideas.

149
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:34,836
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. I saw it.

150
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,858
- He licked his nose again. You saw that, right?
- Yeah.

151
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:39,929
Just before he looked up...
There! He did it again.

152
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:42,061
Did what?
I'm not watching!

153
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,585
- It's so...
- I know, right?

154
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,240
...obvious.

155
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:49,895
Winnie!
Where you going?

156
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,028
Sorry! Watch your head.

157
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,944
- Hey!
- My bad! Watch your back! Sorry.

158
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,684
Whoops! Heads up!

159
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,775
Whoa! Whoa!

160
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,567
Ooh! Gorge has got him in the
Chickenwing Over-the-shoulder Dropface.

161
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,441
Oh! And Tentacular is in
real trouble early in this match.

162
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say

163
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:20,186
that we're in for another
coronation of King Gorge.

164
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,450
There goes that round.

165
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:25,626
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

166
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,021
Listen to me. Look at me. Focus, T.
Remember the game plan.

167
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:32,982
Get him up on his hind legs, and then
you wrap him up with your tentacles...

168
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,896
Wait a second! Wait.
He's got...

169
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,898
- Winnie!
- He's got a tell!

170
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:40,119
How many times do I have to tell you?
Ringside's no place for no little girl.

171
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:42,121
He licks his nose
every time.

172
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,862
What are you talking about?

173
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:45,690
He licks
before he strikes!

174
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,779
Is Winnie right, Sig?

175
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:55,482
You're a good boy, aren't you?
Yes, you are.

176
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:58,442
Good boy.
Who's a good boy, then?

177
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,228
Pull up your socks
and take this guy out.

178
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:04,448
Good call, Winnie.

179
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,415
Ah! Yeah!

180
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:25,512
- Yes!
- Whoa!

181
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,515
Yay! Go, Tentacular, go!

182
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,824
Yeah, T! Finish him!

183
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:42,442
T with the Shark Fin Super Stunner!

184
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,102
He's out!

185
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:56,108
We did it, Sig.
Stoker's back on top.

186
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:58,763
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sure is, kid.

187
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:03,115
Oh, yeah, Stoker!
I'm going to an unnamed theme park!

188
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,640
T, get over here,
big guy.

189
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,034
You did it.
You are the champion.

190
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,950
You got the job done.
Can you tell us what this means to you?

191
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:16,215
Marc, let me tell you.
This means so much to Tentacular.

192
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,914
But first,
I just have to thank Stoker.

193
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,482
I love you, Tentacular!

194
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:26,269
Oh, this town,
you have given Tentacular

195
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,662
everything Tentacular needed

196
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,970
to realize
Tentacular's dream!

197
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:34,190
I love you, Stoker!

198
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,409
Aw!

199
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:37,976
So, thank you, Stoker.

200
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,415
You will always have
a special place in my heart

201
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,114
as the place
that Tentacular left

202
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:48,943
to go somewhere much,
much better.

203
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:50,684
- What?
- Huh?

204
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,338
What?

205
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:55,167
Are you serious?
You're really leaving Stoker?

206
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,864
Of course, Marc.

207
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:00,433
I'm about to make history.
My own history.

208
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:05,221
Can't do that in Stoker.
There's too much history here already.

209
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:10,965
That's why I'm taking
my talents to Slitherpoole.

210
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,141
No!

211
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:14,534
What's happening, Daddy?

212
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:17,407
Why? Why?

213
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:19,887
Jimothy! Come here.

214
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:23,456
This is my ticket to bigger
and brighter things, Marc.

215
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,939
Oh, ho, ho!
Just let me finish this killer tweet.

216
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,333
Marc, you look good.
Can we take a quick pic?

217
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,465
And send. Perfect. Okay.

218
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,119
That is right, Marc.

219
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:38,167
Now the big guy can actually
win somewhere that matters,

220
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,473
on a stage as big
and beautiful...

221
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:42,562
you know you are...
as he is.

222
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,130
I'm talking about Slitherpoole.

223
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,611
And, Marc, can I just give
a big shout-out to Pop-Pop

224
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,395
for buying me the franchise?

225
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,834
We did it! Anything is possible!
Thank you, Pop-Pop.

226
00:13:55,401 --> 00:14:00,189
So thank you again, Stoker.
Much love. T out.

227
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:07,935
Come on, Sig. Time for the T
train to leave the station.

228
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:11,287
I'm sorry, Winnie.
I gotta go where he goes.

229
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,960
<i>The sports world
is absolutely abuzz</i>

230
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:36,268
<i>with Tentacular's shocking
departure from Stoker last night.</i>

231
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,315
Why did I buy
this stupid sign?

232
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,752
- You gotta be kidding.
- What do we do?

233
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:43,536
Can you believe it?
I can't.

234
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,538
Mom,
are we gonna be okay?

235
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:48,237
I don't know, hon,
but we've been through worse.

236
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,241
"Do you want neon?" "Sure," I said.
"Money's no object."

237
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:54,068
Have you seen
my hair salon?

238
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:58,159
Your hair salon?
What about that tattoo I just got on my...

239
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:03,469
All right everybody, now, settle down.
Just settle down.

240
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:07,081
Look,
I know you're all worried.

241
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,868
After all, each of us owns
a piece of Stoker Stadium.

242
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,610
But what
you don't realize is

243
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:17,918
that things are actually much,
much worse than you know.

244
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,529
Hang on. What?

245
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:22,401
Uh, our councilwoman over here
can explain everything to you.

246
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,316
Probably her fault
anyway.

247
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,885
Wow. Thank you so much,
Mr. Mayor.

248
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,756
Pretty sure
it's your fault, though.

249
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,889
Okay, let me
make it simple.

250
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:34,587
Very simple.

251
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:38,417
The stadium costs
lots of money. Okay?

252
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:43,161
No monster means
no money.

253
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:47,165
No money means
no stadium.

254
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,820
Which is bad for Stoker.

255
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,434
Oh, my gosh! Remember when
Pittsmore lost LeBrontosaurus?

256
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:56,957
Not Pittsmore!

257
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,003
That's right.
All they have left

258
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:01,614
is that illegal
monster wrestling club

259
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:04,225
in that abandoned
bobblehead factory.

260
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:10,362
Ooh. Scary lightning.

261
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:12,016
Okay, hold on,
everybody.

262
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,411
I'm here to tell you
that there is a solution.

263
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,804
The owner of
the Slitherpoole franchise

264
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:21,242
has offered us a lot of money
to buy the stadium.

265
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:23,462
- Yes!
- We're saved.

266
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,421
Yes, yes, that is great.

267
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:29,425
He's gonna blow up the stadium
and turn it into a parking lot.

268
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:31,601
- What?
- What?

269
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:33,733
- A parking lot?
- Yes!

270
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:36,823
With shuttle service
to Slitherpoole.

271
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:40,523
You can't do that to the Jimbo
Coyle Stadium! That's... No!

272
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,004
Sorry. The whole town will go
bankrupt unless we sell to Jimothy.

273
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:47,138
But without monster wrestling,
we're not Stoker.

274
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:49,488
- We'll have nothing.
- We'll have a parking lot.

275
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:53,492
You can't just tear down everything
my dad and Rayburn built here.

276
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:54,972
They never quit.

277
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,191
You know what
my dad always said?

278
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,542
"When you get knocked down,
you get back up."

279
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,109
Getting back up isn't gonna
pay my bills, Winnie.

280
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:05,417
- I invested everything in him.
- What am I supposed to do?

281
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:06,984
Winnie, look, I'm sorry.

282
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,074
The loans on the stadium
are due in 90 days.

283
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:13,991
And if you think we can replace a
champion like Tentacular before then,

284
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,168
that... that's just...
it's crazy!

285
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:21,564
- Get real.
- We're doomed.

286
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:04,128
And in the blue corner,

287
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:06,826
the hometown hero:

288
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,003
Rayburn!

289
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:14,094
Hey, Win,
what do you think?

290
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:18,490
It's gonna be tough, but Rayburn
has one thing Gargantuan doesn't.

291
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,536
Oh. What's that?

292
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:21,928
You, Dad.

293
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,104
Better watch out, Siggy.

294
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:26,933
Looks like Jimbo's got himself
a new assistant coach.

295
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:30,067
You're a riot, Rayburn.
Now can we please focus on the match?

296
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,462
Okay, Rayburn.
You know what to do.

297
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:36,769
Everything we need to win
is in here,

298
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:40,164
in here, and in here.

299
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,341
Now, go make
Stoker proud.

300
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,474
And here we go!

301
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,520
Take him down!

302
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,305
And there it is!
The Reverse STO

303
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:54,526
and another championship for
Rayburn, the greatest of all time!

304
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,529
He did it!
He got the Big Belt, Dad!

305
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,890
Bye, Mom! I'm going to Pittsmore
to find Stoker a new monster.

306
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:11,891
What? No.

307
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,937
This isn't
your responsibility.

308
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,548
- You don't have to do this.
- It's what Dad would have done.

309
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,987
I'm Jimbo Coyle's daughter.
How can I do anything less?

310
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:26,732
<i>Now approaching the
station, the Pittsmore Local.</i>

311
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:38,527
- <i>Last stop, Pittsmore.</i>
- What? Wha...

312
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:16,216
Axehammer!
Axehammer! Axehammer!

313
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,478
Hey, watch it!

314
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,655
Five minutes till bets close!
Place your bets!

315
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,614
Sorry.

316
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,487
Yeah!

317
00:20:26,531 --> 00:20:30,709
Come on, give me a challenge.
Axehammer wants a challenge!

318
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:32,885
Ah! Just take it easy.

319
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,193
Oh, you want some more of that?
You want some more of the Axehammer?

320
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,065
No, bro! No, no, no, no, no, no...

321
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:44,462
That is so much pain, bro.

322
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:45,768
Ooh!

323
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,119
You like that?
Axehammer is the man!

324
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,993
Defenestrate! Defenestrate!

325
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:01,914
Ooh.

326
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,921
Just think about it.
Sign up with Stoker.

327
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:11,358
I can get you matches
in a real stadium.

328
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,273
You'll be wrestling
in the big leagues,

329
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:16,886
and, as a bonus,
you'll get me as your coach!

330
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:19,192
It's a win-win-Winnie!

331
00:21:20,977 --> 00:21:22,979
You're the coach, huh?

332
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:40,257
Oh, too much.

333
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,174
And me as your coach.
It's a win-win-Winnie!

334
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,351
It's a win-win-Winnie?

335
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,746
Win-win-Winnie?

336
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,182
Winnie?

337
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:56,186
Another root beer
on the rocks.

338
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,450
Ugh!

339
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:00,973
Tough night, huh?

340
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:03,846
Eh, don't worry. Your luck's
gotta change, right?

341
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,325
I mean, look at me.

342
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:08,677
I just put every last
cent I have on that guy.

343
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,766
Uh, the guy with the tusks?

344
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,332
Looks like a pretty sure thing.

345
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:17,207
No. The slobby-looking guy
with the horns.

346
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,817
Oh!

347
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,559
That there is
Steve the Stupendous.

348
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:24,997
- He's...
- He's never won a single match.

349
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,738
He's a thousand-to-one odds!

350
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:29,741
He wins,
I get a hundred grand!

351
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:32,135
Okay, you asked for it.

352
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:34,920
Get ready for the Moon Boom!

353
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:38,402
Get ready for the Moon Boom!

354
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,100
Oh, careful, Son.

355
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:46,671
Rayburn Jr.?
This is perfect!

356
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:47,890
Huh?

357
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,630
Wha...

358
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,764
I said, here it comes!

359
00:22:52,808 --> 00:22:56,289
Bring it on,
you sack of warm puke.

360
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,989
Oh, I'm bringing the warm puke.
Don't worry.

361
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:02,861
There's gonna be a lot of puke
coming outta me,

362
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:05,211
which is obviously
super gross.

363
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:07,387
You know, um,
I can't jump that far.

364
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:09,085
Why did you have to
climb up there?

365
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:12,175
I thought it would look cool.
This looks cool, right?

366
00:23:12,218 --> 00:23:13,611
This sucks!

367
00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:16,657
You suck! Just come closer.

368
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,921
Rayburn Jr.!
What are you doing here?

369
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,010
Hmm?

370
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:23,142
Dang it.

371
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:24,709
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

372
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:27,233
You're supposed to land on me.
Then I reverse you...

373
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:29,105
- Ray-Ray! Yoo-hoo! Up here!
- Who is Ray?

374
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:31,063
No one.
I've never heard of Ray.

375
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,457
Did you see that?
Yeah, Steve!

376
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,852
Quit messing around, Steve.
You're supposed to lose.

377
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:39,289
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

378
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:43,032
Stick to the script, fellas.
Don't wanna get the boss upset, do we?

379
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:48,167
No, we do not. Okay, Klonk,
let's end this with a bang.

380
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:49,865
I'm gonna go for
the Kesagiri Chop,

381
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:53,085
but you catch it and finish me
off with a Reverse Clothesline.

382
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,784
Classic.

383
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,655
This little piggy's
coming home!

384
00:23:57,698 --> 00:24:01,267
Hey! Over here! Rayburn,
I can't believe it's you!

385
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:04,793
- This has gotta be fate.
- Hey, get off the ropes, kid.

386
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,926
- Steve, just go down already.
- Got it.

387
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,929
Sorry, buddy.
Just clothesline me.

388
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,064
Ray-Ray, come on.
It's me, Winnie Coyle!

389
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:16,979
Uh-oh.
Would you get outta here?

390
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,808
Rayburn, when you're done doing
whatever this is, we should talk.

391
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:22,158
I said, get outta here!

392
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:27,337
No!

393
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,516
Oh, no.

394
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:38,565
Uh, one.

395
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,480
Two.

396
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:42,308
Klonk! You gotta get up.

397
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:43,875
- Three...
- Get up, get up!

398
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,182
And Steve the Stupendous
seems to be trying...

399
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,488
unsuccessfully...
to lose now.

400
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:50,795
- Six. Seven.
- He's up, he's up!

401
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,842
- Eight. Nine.
- Really?

402
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,974
- Nine and a half.
- Come on, Klonk!

403
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,584
Nine and three-quarters.

404
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:02,285
- Get up, Klonk.
- Nine and nine-tenths!

405
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,983
Ugh. Ten. Takedown.

406
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,855
Fight's over.

407
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:09,509
I won! I won, I won!

408
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,129
I'm out of here.

409
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,438
Oh. Whoa.
Hey, Denise.

410
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,006
Where do you think
you're going, Steve?

411
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,617
Uh, nowhere.

412
00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:44,066
Steve. Steve.

413
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,373
Steve, Steve,
Stevie, Stevie, Steve.

414
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:06,653
Looks like we have a little
bit of a problem, Stevie.

415
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:10,048
I paid you
to lose tonight,

416
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:12,703
like I do every night.

417
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:15,967
It was an accident, I swear.
You know me. I love to lose.

418
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:17,882
I'm the best loser
in the biz.

419
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:19,840
Yes, you were.

420
00:26:19,884 --> 00:26:21,581
I won!

421
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,933
I won a hundred grand!
I can go to college now!

422
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:30,025
Do you know what happens
to those who betray Lady Mayhen?

423
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:31,983
- Very...
- Yeah?

424
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,506
- ...bad...
- Uh-huh.

425
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,595
...painful things.

426
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:39,338
Lady Mayhen wants her money.

427
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:41,210
Listen,
I'll make it up to you.

428
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:44,169
I'll wrestle for free.
I'll clean the toilets. Whatever you want.

429
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:48,782
You know what I really want?
The money, honey!

430
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:52,308
All of it, times ten.

431
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:54,484
Honestly,
I'm not great with math,

432
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:56,790
but I don't know how I'm ever
gonna be able to pay you.

433
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,706
- I think I can help.
- I don't know you. I don't know her!

434
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,189
Sure, you do. It's me. Winnie Coyle?
Come on. You remember me, Rayb...

435
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,583
- My name is Steve.
- Hello!

436
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,978
I hate to interrupt this charming
little reunion you're having,

437
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:12,806
but, Steve, there's still
the matter of my money.

438
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,289
I don't want to see you again
until you have all of it.

439
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,466
Every last dollar bill.

440
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:24,166
Oh, Klonk! Where are you?

441
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,170
Clock is ticking, Steve.
Ticktock, ticktock.

442
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,694
Whoa!

443
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:35,177
Hey! Wait up!

444
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,483
Man, I never thought
I'd see you again.

445
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,659
Oh, won't you just
leave me alone?

446
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:43,881
Just hear me out.
I can help you get that money.

447
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:45,883
Tentacular turned heel
and bailed,

448
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:48,929
and you probably saw that, along with
everyone else in the stinking world,

449
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:50,148
which was awesome.

450
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:53,108
But that means
Stoker needs a monster.

451
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:55,110
Yeah, no.

452
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,589
Listen to me.

453
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,505
I can help you.
Just come with me to Stoker.

454
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:03,335
I'm not going back...
to that place that I've never been.

455
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:07,513
Ha! Wow. You are not
good at lying, Rayburn.

456
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,516
Hey, kid.
You got the wrong monster.

457
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,171
I don't think so, Rayburn.

458
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:18,046
Rayburn was my dad. And I'm not
gonna cash in on his name. Ever.

459
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,526
I knew it!
I knew it was you!

460
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,702
I mean, it's been forever,

461
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:25,183
and I was yea small,
and you were yea tall,

462
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:26,619
and now you're, like, yea!

463
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,274
Hey, you think
monster puberty was easy?

464
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:32,973
Sorry. This is a real thing
I'm offering you.

465
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:34,453
Look, I have my dad's playbook.

466
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:37,282
I could coach you up,
get you a big match in Stoker,

467
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:39,893
and, boom,
both our problems are solved.

468
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:43,636
You think
you're gonna coach me?

469
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:47,379
Oh, Stevie!

470
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:51,383
What are you still doing here?
Go get me my money, man!

471
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:54,082
Help me.

472
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,867
Oh, Klonk,
you're on mani-pedi duty.

473
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,564
Oh, no. No!

474
00:28:58,608 --> 00:28:59,478
So, Coach...

475
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:01,654
- Stoker?
- Yes!

476
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:07,138
Isn't this just great? It'll just
be like old times again, you know?

477
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:10,620
Pretty sure that doesn't mean the
same thing to me as it does to you.

478
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:14,798
Hey. Are you gonna make me
walk to Stoker?

479
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:16,321
Yep. I am.

480
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,584
- All the way?
- All the way.

481
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:20,978
Come on.
Just give me a ride, Rayburn.

482
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:23,720
Never call me
that name again.

483
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:27,767
Okay. I'll never call you that again...
if you give me a ride.

484
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,607
Comfy up there?

485
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:45,263
You must be exhausted
from ruining my life.

486
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:47,961
Need a pillow?
Maybe a chocolate?

487
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,790
Sorry we don't provide
turndown service.

488
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,723
Whoa.

489
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:17,295
Wow. This place
hasn't changed a bit.

490
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,472
I know.
It's magical, isn't it?

491
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:22,170
It's still got that...

492
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:25,390
mmm, that smell
of sweat and feet.

493
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:27,610
Ah. Really big feet.

494
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:31,440
You're a real weird kid.
Real weird.

495
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:33,485
Yeah, I know.

496
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:37,185
You know, Steve, you're not the first
person to say that to me, actually.

497
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:38,751
You're really not.

498
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:51,851
Whoo!

499
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,029
It looks
just like you, Dad.

500
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:58,336
- You wanna live up to the Rayburn name?
- Yeah.

501
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,906
It's gonna take a lot more than
some fancy dance moves, Junior.

502
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:04,734
Time to get serious.

503
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:08,346
<i>Steve?</i>

504
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,435
<i>Steve?</i>

505
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:13,177
Steve!

506
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:16,354
- Are you okay?
- Oh, sure. Never better.

507
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:24,754
Look, I know
you don't wanna be here.

508
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:29,715
And I'm really sorry that I messed
things up for you in Pittsmore.

509
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,979
But if we don't do this,

510
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:37,332
they're gonna knock down the stadium
and turn it into a parking lot,

511
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,725
and that's all
I have left of Dad.

512
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:43,251
- And your dad is part of that too.
- A parking lot?

513
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:44,600
Yep.

514
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,602
No monster, no money.

515
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:48,865
- Maybe it's for the best.
- What?

516
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,911
How can you say that?
That's our dads' legacy!

517
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:55,785
I hate to break it to you, but saving
that stadium won't bring him back.

518
00:31:55,828 --> 00:31:59,267
I know that. I just thought you
might actually care about helping...

519
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,445
Let's get something straight.
I love wrestling. I loved my dad.

520
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,055
But I'm not gonna be him.

521
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:06,883
Especially for you.

522
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,319
I'm gonna be me.

523
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:11,191
And who are you, Steve?

524
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:16,066
I'm the guy who's here for the money.
You got me?

525
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,937
Oh, I got you.

526
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,765
Money all the way.

527
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,814
You should probably get some rest.
We start training tomorrow.

528
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,297
Training.
Yeah, right. Good one.

529
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,690
6:00 a.m. Sharp.

530
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,258
You're... You're serious?

531
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,871
What?

532
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,622
- Good morning.
- Hi, Mom.

533
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:53,364
How are you feeling?
You ready?

534
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,499
Do you think
I can do this?

535
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,284
I think you won't know
until you try.

536
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:01,807
Just remember:

537
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:05,507
Train the monster you have,
not the one you wish you had.

538
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,422
Did Dad say that?

539
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,381
Uh, no.
Mom did, just now.

540
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,340
Okay.

541
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,385
Hey. You forgetting
something?

542
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:17,301
Oh. Mwah!
See you tonight.

543
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:19,347
I meant these.

544
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,654
Dad's keys?

545
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:26,179
You tell Rayburn...
I mean, Steve...

546
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:28,007
that Mrs. C says hi.

547
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,357
Now, go coach him.

548
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,010
Yes!

549
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,242
Whoa!

550
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:47,113
Whoo!

551
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:50,203
- Morning, Fred!
- Whoa!

552
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:52,554
Namaste, Winnie!

553
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:59,038
Whoo-hoo!

554
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:02,477
Whoa!

555
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:08,221
What... Hey, come back!

556
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:12,835
Steve.

557
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,793
You ready?

558
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,231
Hey. Rise and shine.

559
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,320
- Hey, Steve, wake up!
- What?

560
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:23,672
I had this terrible dream that I
promised I would get up and train.

561
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:24,890
Oh, it's real!

562
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:27,327
So, are you ready?
Let's do this.

563
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:30,026
Go ahead. You start.
Set up all the cones or whatever.

564
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,203
Oh, ho! No, you don't.
Up and at 'em, sunshine.

565
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:37,555
It is go time. Game day.
Ain't no time like the present.

566
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,818
Man, why can't I think of
more sports clichés?

567
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,734
Uh... Well, until I do,
let's train.

568
00:34:42,778 --> 00:34:45,215
You are a rude little girl.

569
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:47,565
Scooch your booty!

570
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,393
This is important.

571
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:50,960
With a capital I.

572
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:55,530
Yeah, well, I never really
felt training was important.

573
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:57,749
I can tell.

574
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:00,970
No one thinks we can do this,
but we're gonna show them.

575
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,540
I'm going back to sleep.

576
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,455
You are not, mister!

577
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:11,241
You just go get me that match,
and I'll take care of the rest.

578
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,898
Okay. I'll get you a match.

579
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:23,471
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to an evening of monster wrestling!</i>

580
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:25,081
Weighing in at 18 tons,

581
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,780
you know him, you love him,
you're scared of him:

582
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:32,958
Wham Bam
Ramarilla Jackson!

583
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,918
Here comes the Rammer Hammer!

584
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:40,575
- Rama, Rama, Rama!
- Rilla, Rilla, Rilla!

585
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:44,230
Boom! Boom!
It's Ramarilla time!

586
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:50,323
Oh, wow. This guy's
a real showman.

587
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,500
Okay. Everything we need

588
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:55,154
is in here, in here,
and in...

589
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,330
Oh, this is original.
Are you for real?

590
00:35:57,374 --> 00:36:00,159
- What do you think you're doing right now?
- I'm doing my coach speech.

591
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:04,033
Do I look like the kind of guy who's
gonna go for the "rah-rah" stuff?

592
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,646
Fine.
Then let's talk strategy.

593
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,450
- You wanna feint a Reverse STO.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

594
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:12,694
- And then when we get him behind you...
- You know what?

595
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,652
I think I'm just gonna go
with what I know.

596
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,306
- For reals?
- Yeah, for realsies.

597
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:19,091
No. I'm your coach,
and we need a strategy.

598
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,007
Trust me. I got this.
Watch and learn.

599
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:25,663
You know the rules.
I want a good, clean wrestling match.

600
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:28,536
So if you're gonna do something
illegal, don't let me see it.

601
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:30,799
Go to your corners
and come out wrestling!

602
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:33,410
Not too hard, right?

603
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:36,718
- Sorry. I just love to laugh. That's me.
- I ain't laughing.

604
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,024
But I will be when I pin
your face in the dirt

605
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,070
and break your jaw
with my horns!

606
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,682
Boy, does that sound painful.
Can't wait.

607
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:50,122
And here come the
wrestlers, circling each other.

608
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,909
Hey, why don't you circle down
to Georgie's Mattress Outlet?

609
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:58,478
Oh, gosh, you really
got me on that!

610
00:36:58,522 --> 00:37:00,742
I think I'm knocked out.

611
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,875
I am going down. Timber.

612
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:06,486
Wow.

613
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,881
Usually these things last long enough
for me to get through a few more ads.

614
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:11,448
- One!
- What are you doing?

615
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,058
- Two! Three!
- Get up, drama queen.

616
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:15,713
- I know you can hear me, you big faker.
- Four! Five!

617
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:17,454
- Get up, so I can knock you out!
- Six!

618
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:19,630
- Don't you think that's kind of a waste?
- Seven! Eight!

619
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:21,240
- I'm already down here.
- Nine!

620
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:23,634
Stop right there,
or you're next!

621
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:28,073
Wow. You're really
up there, huh?

622
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:30,641
No. No, no, no, no!

623
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,733
- Go back to your corner!
- And that's round one.

624
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:37,474
That's the bell.

625
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,931
Remember, folks, if Ramarilla
gets a knockout in the second...

626
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:43,262
What was that? You are
embarrassing us out there!

627
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:45,438
This isn't Pittsmore.
This is a real match.

628
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:48,659
- You can't just throw it.
- Yeah, I get that now, okay?

629
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:52,620
So I just need to figure out how
not to die, and then cha-ching.

630
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:55,797
- That's the sound of me making money.
- There's no money if you lose.

631
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,886
Wait, what?
You said this was a paid match.

632
00:37:57,929 --> 00:37:59,801
It is. Winner takes all.

633
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,107
You didn't read the paperwork
I had you sign?

634
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:03,718
Nobody reads the paperwork!

635
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,676
So, if you want
that money,

636
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,548
we're gonna have to try a very
radical new strategy here.

637
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:10,855
Ready for it? Try to win.

638
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:12,640
Okay, big shot. How?

639
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:14,946
Okay.
Uh, so, he's strong.

640
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,688
- Yeah, I got that.
- He's really freakishly strong.

641
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,299
But you know what that means.
No stamina.

642
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:22,388
- So here's what you're gonna do. Run away.
- Uh-huh.

643
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:26,044
If he does catch you, let him hit you.
Then start running again.

644
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,742
That's your big plan?

645
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,179
Yep, and then when he's all punched
out, we make our move.

646
00:38:30,222 --> 00:38:32,485
So run away
and then let him hit me.

647
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:35,793
And if you get knocked down,
you're gonna get back up.

648
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:38,404
Staying down is much easier.

649
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:39,492
- Get back up!
- Okay!

650
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:46,717
Oh, no.

651
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:49,677
Okay, so now what?
Just keep going in a circle

652
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,417
and hope
he runs out of steam?

653
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:54,290
Yes! That's it. Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

654
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,336
Keep going! You're doing it!
Oh! I hope this works.

655
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,817
I thought you said
he had no stamina!

656
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:01,732
It's a theory!

657
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,779
Whoo-hoo!

658
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:08,260
Ha, ha! See you later, sucker!

659
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,875
Oh, that smarts.

660
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,970
Keep it up!
He's slowing down!

661
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:25,147
Is he? 'Cause it feels like
he's speeding up.

662
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:28,498
- Look out!
- Whoa!

663
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,425
No, no, no, no, no, no!

664
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:45,297
Does he just not get hurt?
Is that his deal?

665
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:51,695
Oh!

666
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,828
- Yes!
- Yeah!

667
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:00,573
Get up! He's coming!

668
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:01,923
Uh-oh.

669
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:17,852
Now, pin him!

670
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:22,334
I am less exhausted
than you.

671
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,300
He's out!

672
00:40:31,343 --> 00:40:35,434
And the winner is...
Steve the Stupendous?

673
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:39,525
Yes! Yes! All right!
Way to go, Ray... I mean, Steve!

674
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:42,093
Oh, yeah!
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

675
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:44,400
You did it! You won!

676
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,490
- This is winning?
- Yeah. How does it feel?

677
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:51,624
It feels... not bad.

678
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:53,931
I feel not bad!

679
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:58,414
And now for my favorite
segment: "Worst Match of the Week."

680
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:01,591
Easy choice this week, Marc.
Take a look.

681
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,724
Oh, man. It's really
an insult to the sport.

682
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,466
And I don't just mean
this sport. I mean any sport!

683
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,122
To competitiveness, for crying out loud!
This is just awful!

684
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,429
Okay, calm down there, Marc.

685
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,649
And now we're gonna go
from the bottom of the league

686
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:18,869
to the very tippy, tippy top.

687
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:20,828
Slitherpoole!

688
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:24,614
Ooh! What a brutal takedown!
And to everybody who wondered

689
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:28,313
how Tentacular would handle the
big-city pressure, the answer's simple.

690
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:30,011
He's never wrestled better.

691
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:34,189
<i>Who is the GOAT? G-O-A-T?</i>

692
00:41:34,232 --> 00:41:38,846
<i>Me! The greatest of all time!</i>

693
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:41,979
Why did he leave us?
I miss him.

694
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:45,287
He's so big,
fast, strong.

695
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:49,857
Ha! Whatever the opposite is of
that monster Winnie dragged here.

696
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,946
She just never did know
when to quit.

697
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,867
Why?

698
00:42:01,216 --> 00:42:03,174
Ugh!
"Worst match of the week."

699
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:06,699
I know. My first win,
and it was on TV.

700
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:08,701
- How awesome.
- No.

701
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:10,355
No, it's not awesome, Steve.

702
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:12,923
No one's ever gonna fight us in Stoker.
We're a joke.

703
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:15,926
And just for the tiniest moment there,
I was feeling okay about myself.

704
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,538
Yeah, well, that's over now.
Look, you still need a pile of cash,

705
00:42:19,582 --> 00:42:24,543
and I need to stop Jimothy from
turning this into a parking lot.

706
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,371
We need to get serious.

707
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:29,461
I hate getting serious.

708
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:33,248
It's time to do it by the book.
My dad's playbook.

709
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:36,642
This is the key that'll turn you
from a zero into a hero.

710
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:39,819
Oh, "zero," is it?
That's motivating.

711
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,952
Chapter One: Basic Fitness.

712
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:43,823
Oh, I'm tired already.

713
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:45,216
Yeah, let's do this.

714
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:51,744
One.

715
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:59,752
Okay. Give you that one.

716
00:42:59,796 --> 00:43:01,450
One... quarter.

717
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:04,105
One. One. One-half.

718
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,542
One. One. One.

719
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:07,891
One. One.

720
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:09,588
I don't understand.

721
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:12,026
We've got the right music
playing and everything.

722
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:13,592
You should be getting better.

723
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:16,639
Probably should've gone
lighter on breakfast.

724
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:18,771
Yes, you should have.

725
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:21,339
We're gonna get working
on your diet later,

726
00:43:21,383 --> 00:43:23,602
but right now,
let's go to the tape.

727
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:26,301
Look, look, look!
Right there.

728
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:28,651
The Reverse STO.
It can't be defended.

729
00:43:28,694 --> 00:43:31,959
Uh, are you really gonna
show me film of my dad?

730
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:33,569
Of course.
He was the greatest.

731
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,614
Yeah. Clearly
it's a thing for me.

732
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:38,226
Have you never heard of
"daddy issues"?

733
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:41,185
Oh. Right. Sorry.

734
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:45,059
Okay. Uh, how about some
visualization exercises?

735
00:43:46,495 --> 00:43:47,539
See?

736
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:50,803
I'm crushing you.

737
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,155
Oh, wow, look.
I don't even have to visualize.

738
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,244
I could totally just do it.

739
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,028
Get serious, Steve!

740
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:01,945
Oh, come on. You need to lighten up.
I'm just having some fun.

741
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,903
Monster wrestling
isn't about fun!

742
00:44:03,947 --> 00:44:06,080
Oh, okay, "Jimbo."

743
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,212
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

744
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:10,040
You don't try!

745
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:13,739
I try not to be a stick in the mud.
Maybe you ought to try that too.

746
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:15,611
You're uncoachable!

747
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:18,005
And you're not good
at coaching!

748
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:33,585
I'm sorry, but this is why I
left Stoker in the first place.

749
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,154
Everyone wants me to be my dad.
And I'm not.

750
00:44:48,861 --> 00:44:51,473
Okay. Maybe you're right.

751
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:54,737
Maybe I'm going about this
all wrong.

752
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:59,002
Let's just start over.

753
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:01,700
What gets you out of bed in the morning?

754
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:05,965
What gets your heart racing, your
blood pumping? What do you love to do?

755
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:08,620
Uh... nothing.

756
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,840
Come on.
There must be something.

757
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:15,366
No, I'm sorry. I really,
literally mean I like to do nothing.

758
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,064
I'm gonna need
more than that.

759
00:45:17,107 --> 00:45:18,978
Oh. Uh, sleeping?

760
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:22,112
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, really. I'm real good at it.

761
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,984
- Or sitting is another one. I like sitting.
- Not helping.

762
00:45:25,028 --> 00:45:27,900
Did I mention sitting?
I feel like I did. Oh, eating!

763
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:29,989
Is there anything else?

764
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:34,298
Oh, there's also salsa, but, uh,
yeah, that's it. That's probably it.

765
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,171
Like, with chips?

766
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:39,912
I said it very clear.
I said salsa.

767
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:43,002
Like salsa, salsa?

768
00:45:43,046 --> 00:45:44,569
I don't like dancing.

769
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,963
Is that so?

770
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,797
Okay, yes!

771
00:45:56,973 --> 00:46:00,019
There's nothing on this planet
I love more than dancing.

772
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:02,805
I mean, you know, I prefer
traditional Cuban salsa,

773
00:46:02,848 --> 00:46:05,677
but this up-tempo stuff's
pretty cool too.

774
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,723
Ha! You're a surprisingly
good dancer.

775
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:12,249
I ran with a pretty fast crowd in
Cuba when my dad wrestled down there.

776
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:15,209
Wrestling is 80% footwork.

777
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:19,865
Yeah, I learned the tango in
Argentina, the flamenco in Spain.

778
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:24,043
Well, anyway, that was a different life.
How about this?

779
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:27,134
- Hold on.
- Not bad for 22 tons.

780
00:46:54,204 --> 00:46:57,468
Whoa!

781
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:00,210
- Left foot.
- Left foot.

782
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:01,516
- Right foot.
- Right foot.

783
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,823
- Left.
- And big finish!

784
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,308
Oh, yeah!

785
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:21,623
You're doing great!

786
00:47:22,493 --> 00:47:24,800
All right, where is he?

787
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,759
I can't even see him.

788
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:35,202
This guy is crazy fast.

789
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:39,815
You've gotta slow him down.
Execute Plan Tango!

790
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:53,742
Yes, yes! Keep it up!
It's working!

791
00:47:55,265 --> 00:47:56,788
Yes! Now!

792
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:02,011
Steve won!

793
00:48:02,054 --> 00:48:03,882
Yeah! Oh!

794
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,798
This is embarrassing nonsense
we're witnessing right now.

795
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,721
What are you doing?

796
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:19,289
I'm learning to dance
so I can coach you better.

797
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,596
No, no, no, no.
You are not dancing.

798
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,989
See? Look.
See what I'm doing?

799
00:48:24,033 --> 00:48:27,254
- I'm trying.
- Man, you gotta get out more.

800
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:32,955
Hey, Steve, wake up!
Are you pretending to be asleep right now?

801
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,574
Two!

802
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:05,640
Come on, push it, Steve.
Pain is weakness leaving the body.

803
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,818
I'm awake! Whoa!

804
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:15,737
Yes.

805
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:29,098
- Yes!
- Steve! Whoo-hoo! Up top.

806
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:30,665
Now you're dancing.

807
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:48,900
Okay, so, there's no spots left
in the Saturday Super Smashdown.

808
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:53,383
But some lizard dude in the Eastern
League is shedding his skin right now.

809
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:55,211
Ew! Gross!

810
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:56,778
Ugh! I know.

811
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:59,694
So, they'll take us
as a replacement!

812
00:50:01,086 --> 00:50:03,959
The only catch is,
this guy you're gonna wrestle,

813
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,440
he is really big.

814
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:09,007
Like, I mean, huge!

815
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:12,881
Think of the biggest thing
you've ever seen. Enormous!

816
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:17,059
Oh, come on.

817
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:21,368
- It's in my mouth!
- Ugh!

818
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:24,893
The only way we're gonna beat him
is by getting him on his back.

819
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:27,896
- So how do we do that?
- <i>Wait for it.</i>

820
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:30,594
We're gonna need some help.

821
00:50:30,638 --> 00:50:35,033
Long time no see, Steve.

822
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:37,862
What?

823
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:38,994
Okay, get ready.

824
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,910
Nobody puts Ray-Ray
in a corner.

825
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:45,696
Now, lift!

826
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,524
- Come on.
- Lift me!

827
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:50,092
Do it again! Again!

828
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:52,921
That's it. You got it.

829
00:50:54,226 --> 00:50:55,793
Whee!

830
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:57,926
And now, do the lift!

831
00:51:13,507 --> 00:51:15,204
You did it! You won!

832
00:51:15,247 --> 00:51:18,337
Oh, come on, Mac.
This ain't monster wrestling.

833
00:51:18,381 --> 00:51:20,731
It's an affront to the sport,
and you know it.

834
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:22,559
We all should be shocked
and appalled.

835
00:51:22,603 --> 00:51:25,867
But somehow they've won
three in a row.

836
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,479
And the way he combines
traditional Cuban salsa

837
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:31,220
with a hint of modern swing

838
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:34,223
and then finishes
with a lovely technical lift,

839
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:37,792
that is a high degree
of difficulty right there.

840
00:51:37,835 --> 00:51:40,882
Your knowledge of dance moves
is mystifying to me.

841
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:44,712
Still waters run deep, Marc.
Still waters run deep.

842
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:47,932
Right, Mac. Joining us now
from their latest match

843
00:51:47,976 --> 00:51:50,587
is Winnie Coyle
and Steve the Stupendous.

844
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:52,502
<i>Well, guys,</i>

845
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:54,417
congratulations
on your latest win.

846
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:56,158
But, please,
somebody admit it.

847
00:51:56,201 --> 00:51:58,987
This is hardly wrestling.
Y'all know that, right?

848
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,253
Uh, Coach Winnie,
we're live.

849
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:06,995
Live? We're... We're live.
Right. Right. We're live.

850
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:09,258
You know...
You know what?

851
00:52:09,301 --> 00:52:12,435
It is a little hot in here.
I could use a fan.

852
00:52:12,479 --> 00:52:14,829
Speaking of,
I am a fan to you, Marc.

853
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:18,920
Big fan. Uh, you know,
but just what you said before...

854
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:22,967
If it is hardly wrestling,
then how come we just keep winning?

855
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:26,144
- Ho, ho! She got you there, Marc.
- Whatever.

856
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,104
You won a couple against some
very, very questionable opponents.

857
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:32,673
I'll give you that much.
But what's next for Steve the Stupendous?

858
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,979
You know, I was hoping
you would ask that.

859
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:36,851
We are ready
for our next match.

860
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:40,594
And you know where we want it?
Back in Stoker!

861
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:42,334
- Stoker!
- Stoker!

862
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:43,901
You tell 'em, Winnie!

863
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:46,991
That's right! We'll wrestle
any monster anytime!

864
00:52:47,035 --> 00:52:50,429
So, monsters, coaches,
you think you want a crack

865
00:52:50,473 --> 00:52:54,521
<i>at the undefeated, unbeatable
Steve the Stupendous,</i>

866
00:52:54,564 --> 00:52:56,044
<i>you give me a call.</i>

867
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,829
<i>You think you're ready
for a big match in Stoker?</i>

868
00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:01,528
Jimothy.
Hey, you watching this?

869
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,053
Look at me. I'm shaking.

870
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:07,359
Oh, my gosh.
I'm still shaking so much.

871
00:53:07,403 --> 00:53:11,276
Look at my hands! Was I too much
back there? I was too much, right?

872
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,583
Yeah, well,
when it comes to wrestling,

873
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:15,629
"too much" isn't really a thing.

874
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:19,067
- Oh, right.
- Okay. What do we do now, Coach?

875
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,677
Now? We wait.

876
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:26,596
Hello. This is Coach Winnie Coyle.
Uh... Oh.

877
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,424
It's King Gorge's coach.
It worked!

878
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:32,210
Really? He wants to wrestle
Steve the Stupendous?

879
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:35,126
In Stoker?
He'll gladly accept.

880
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,216
We got a match in Stoker!

881
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,394
All right. Okay, King,
I've got you a match you can't lose.

882
00:53:44,483 --> 00:53:46,050
Oh, come on, King!

883
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:49,445
It'll get your confidence back up.
Make you feel good.

884
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,712
New sign is looking good,
Fred.

885
00:53:55,756 --> 00:53:58,280
Thanks, Winnie.
I made it myself.

886
00:53:58,323 --> 00:54:01,718
Took me seven sheets
to spell "stupendous" correctly!

887
00:54:01,762 --> 00:54:04,547
S-T-O-K-E-R!

888
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:05,635
Stoker!

889
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,898
S-T-E-V-E!

890
00:54:07,942 --> 00:54:12,033
- Steve!
- Stoker! Steve!

891
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:16,385
What's going on?

892
00:54:16,428 --> 00:54:17,865
I'm sorry, Winnie.

893
00:54:17,908 --> 00:54:20,432
I know all of this
really old,

894
00:54:20,476 --> 00:54:23,871
completely useless stuff
means a lot to you,

895
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:25,307
but we gotta
clear it out.

896
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,049
They need to rig this place
to blow...

897
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:30,268
- What?
- ...up and explode.

898
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:33,358
No, no, no. They can't do that!
We don't need to sell to Jimothy.

899
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:36,710
- That's mine.
- We just got a match right here in Stoker.

900
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:40,931
Listen, Jimothy sweetened the deal
if we moved up the signing date.

901
00:54:40,975 --> 00:54:44,282
- So, it's a lot of money.
- Uh, what?

902
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,633
Please, there must be
something you can do.

903
00:54:46,676 --> 00:54:48,460
I'm sorry.
You're too late.

904
00:54:48,504 --> 00:54:52,769
The mayor is signing the deal at
Slitherpoole Stadium this afternoon.

905
00:54:52,813 --> 00:54:54,118
Drink Tentaculade,

906
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:57,034
the official drink
of the greatest time of...

907
00:54:57,078 --> 00:54:58,470
Uh, line?

908
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:02,474
Tentaculade, the official
drink of the great... Um, no.

909
00:55:02,518 --> 00:55:05,782
The official great...
Drink greatness! This time...

910
00:55:05,826 --> 00:55:08,350
Oh! This tastes disgusting.

911
00:55:08,393 --> 00:55:11,440
I can't believe this is my drink.
Who approved this?

912
00:55:11,483 --> 00:55:13,050
- That was you, T.
- Oh, me? Oh.

913
00:55:13,094 --> 00:55:15,052
Okay, let's take five,
everyone.

914
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:17,161
All right, everyone. Let's reset.

915
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:20,492
Mr. Jimothy? Uh, the mayor
of Stoker is here for you.

916
00:55:20,536 --> 00:55:22,669
I'd really just like
to thank you, Mr. Jimothy.

917
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:25,846
You've really saved our bacon.
Gosh, I'm hungry.

918
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,022
Oh, me too.
Intermittent fast day.

919
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:31,155
I've been doing it for a week now,
and my blood sugar is going banana...

920
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,071
I'm having a cookie.
Can someone grab me a cookie real quick?

921
00:55:34,115 --> 00:55:38,815
Stop! We don't need to do this.
Mr. Mayor, don't sign.

922
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:41,078
- I already did.
- I love this part.

923
00:55:41,122 --> 00:55:43,428
I'm nervous. I was practicing
my signature yesterday.

924
00:55:43,472 --> 00:55:45,779
I realize that I just
scribble, but watch.

925
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:47,171
- Just hold on!
- What?

926
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:49,304
Mr. Jimothy, Stoker has
a new champion wrestler

927
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:51,523
that everyone in Stoker
is gonna come see.

928
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:52,960
So we don't need your money.

929
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:54,831
- Is that true, Winnie?
- Yes.

930
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:58,922
Steve over here just got a big-time
match in Stoker against King Gorge.

931
00:55:58,966 --> 00:56:00,358
That's right.

932
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:04,188
King Gorge? Oh, man.

933
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:07,452
He hasn't come out of his
kennel since I destroyed him.

934
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:09,628
He's broken.

935
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:11,326
Everybody in the game
knows that.

936
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:15,330
This is so embarrassing for you.
You haven't seen this?

937
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:18,028
Old Gorge is
never gonna wrestle again.

938
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:20,335
And even if he did,

939
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,772
it ain't gonna be
in Stoker Stadium.

940
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:24,513
Sign the papers,
Jimothy.

941
00:56:24,556 --> 00:56:26,733
I don't understand.

942
00:56:26,776 --> 00:56:28,735
Oh, you still don't get it,
do you?

943
00:56:28,778 --> 00:56:30,562
It was never
about the money.

944
00:56:30,606 --> 00:56:34,218
Stoker Stadium is coming
down because I want it to.

945
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:35,959
But why?

946
00:56:36,003 --> 00:56:40,224
Because no matter how many
championships I win,

947
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:46,056
some chump's always gonna be telling
me that I'm not as good as Rayburn.

948
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,930
So I figure I can live
in his shadow,

949
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:53,411
or I can tear down
everything

950
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:55,457
that casts that shadow.

951
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,980
Boom!

952
00:56:57,024 --> 00:57:00,331
Wow. And I thought I had issues.
That's just crazy.

953
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,378
Who asked you?
You make me sick.

954
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:05,641
Dancin' ain't wrestlin'.

955
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:07,599
You're pathetic.

956
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:09,863
- Hey, hey, put him down!
- Okay.

957
00:57:11,952 --> 00:57:15,346
Oh! This is gonna go
so viral!

958
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,526
Please don't do this.

959
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:25,008
That stadium is
everything to that town.

960
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:26,967
To me.

961
00:57:27,663 --> 00:57:29,839
Please don't take that away.

962
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:32,624
Winnie,
this isn't about you.

963
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:34,452
It's all about me.

964
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:36,019
Sign the papers, Jimothy.

965
00:57:40,197 --> 00:57:42,983
You're okay with this?

966
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,637
With him destroying
everything you and Dad built?

967
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:48,858
Winnie, let me tell you something.
I loved your dad.

968
00:57:48,902 --> 00:57:50,817
And he did great things
with Rayburn.

969
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,168
But now it's my chance to do
great things with Tentacular.

970
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:55,647
That's just wrestling.

971
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:02,176
What you're doing
with this dancing,

972
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:05,222
I'm just glad Jimbo
ain't around to see it.

973
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,999
You have enough money
to pay Lady Mayhen now.

974
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:46,481
You don't need me.
Just leave me alone.

975
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:47,874
Even if I wanted to...

976
00:58:49,136 --> 00:58:51,399
...I'm pretty sure
I live here now.

977
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,403
I thought I was
saving my dad's legacy.

978
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,059
And instead, I ruined it.

979
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,279
I've made
the Coyle name a joke.

980
00:59:02,323 --> 00:59:03,715
Well, the good news is,

981
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:06,675
you can always change
your name and run away.

982
00:59:06,718 --> 00:59:08,546
That worked for you, Steve.

983
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,203
But if I'm not Winnie Coyle,
I'm nothing.

984
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,293
Come on, Winnie.

985
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,911
What a sad end
to the legacy of Stoker.

986
00:59:24,954 --> 00:59:26,651
I told you, Mac! I told you!

987
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:29,959
The whole thing was a joke
and a disgrace to the sport!

988
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:32,396
To the Coyle name!
I'll tell you that too!

989
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,921
And I for one
am glad it's over.

990
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:38,794
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

991
00:59:38,837 --> 00:59:40,317
And I still think

992
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:43,277
Steve has a bright
dancing future ahead of him.

993
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,714
Oh, please! Who cares
about dancing, anyway?

994
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:48,586
Everyone cares about dancing!
Live a little, Marc!

995
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:57,813
Look who's back.

996
00:59:57,856 --> 01:00:00,250
It's all there.

997
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:03,906
I should know,
'cause I counted every dollar bill,

998
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,126
and they are...
they're tiny.

999
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:09,999
Ah. Your old locker's
waiting, Steve.

1000
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:18,747
Welcome back, twinkle toes.
We missed you.

1001
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,793
It seems like you are
the hot new favorite

1002
01:00:21,837 --> 01:00:23,708
after all of your adventures.

1003
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:25,536
Cha-cha-cha!

1004
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,191
We got a lot of money on you
to win tonight.

1005
01:00:28,235 --> 01:00:34,110
And I'm gonna keep all of it
when you lose.

1006
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:36,112
Yeah, I know the drill.

1007
01:00:36,156 --> 01:00:40,160
You always were
my best loser.

1008
01:01:24,204 --> 01:01:28,121
Hey. You did
everything you could.

1009
01:01:28,164 --> 01:01:31,080
Then why do I feel like
I let everyone down?

1010
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:33,082
Oh, honey, you didn't.

1011
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:36,607
What you did out there,
coaching Ray-Ray,

1012
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,305
you were incredible.

1013
01:01:38,348 --> 01:01:40,481
You should be so proud
of yourself.

1014
01:01:40,524 --> 01:01:44,224
It's okay, Mom.
I don't care about that anymore.

1015
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:49,098
Froyo. Froyo makes
everything better.

1016
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:50,926
What flavor do you want?

1017
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:52,754
- Chocolate.
- You got it.

1018
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,072
Oh, my gosh.
What are you doing here?

1019
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:08,378
Ow! Right in the eye!

1020
01:02:08,422 --> 01:02:10,554
- I'm sorry!
- No.

1021
01:02:10,598 --> 01:02:13,470
That's all right.
I should've called first.

1022
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:17,039
But, you know, I don't have a phone.
Or pockets or...

1023
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:20,477
Look,
I need my coach back.

1024
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,914
Don't you get it?

1025
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,917
We're a total joke.
We don't belong in the ring.

1026
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:29,704
Hey, you know that feeling
that you're feeling right now?

1027
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,358
That's how I felt
my whole life.

1028
01:02:31,401 --> 01:02:34,100
I spent so much time
running away

1029
01:02:34,143 --> 01:02:36,189
from what I thought
I should be

1030
01:02:36,232 --> 01:02:39,148
or what people
expected me to be

1031
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:41,281
that I never found out
what I could be.

1032
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,588
And now... now I have.

1033
01:02:44,632 --> 01:02:48,679
And I know that
I'm never gonna be the GOAT

1034
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,118
or win the Big Belt,
and that is just fine.

1035
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:55,338
But I am not going back
to being a loser.

1036
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:57,601
And that's on you.

1037
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:59,516
You ruined losing
for me.

1038
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,737
And you know what?
It feels good.

1039
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,610
I feel good for, like,
the first time.

1040
01:03:06,654 --> 01:03:09,135
So, thank you.

1041
01:03:09,178 --> 01:03:11,615
Rayburn, I...

1042
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,490
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

1043
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,581
Okay, okay.
Enough with the sappy stuff.

1044
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:21,712
Ugh.

1045
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,628
I am here to help you
save that stadium.

1046
01:03:24,672 --> 01:03:25,934
What?

1047
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,938
With this super-sweet
satellite parking lot,

1048
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:32,810
you'll be able to park
on quality asphalt.

1049
01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:35,248
Stuff you guys haven't seen
in a while.

1050
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:38,512
And we've put some beautiful
yellow lines right on there.

1051
01:03:38,555 --> 01:03:40,818
And then you can take
the shuttle...

1052
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:44,126
Uh, is that a fin on top?
I'll never tell...

1053
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:47,303
and see Tentacular wrestle
once again

1054
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:51,307
in classy and distant
Slitherpoole.

1055
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:53,483
Hot dogs are on you!

1056
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:56,834
Hey, buddy. I'm getting hurt. If we can
blow this up and get out, that'd be great.

1057
01:03:56,878 --> 01:03:58,184
With pleasure!

1058
01:03:58,227 --> 01:04:00,577
Five, four, three,
two, one. Go!

1059
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:08,019
Ha!

1060
01:04:09,238 --> 01:04:13,460
Well, that was disappointing.

1061
01:04:13,503 --> 01:04:17,333
What's the matter, boys?
You show up, but no blow up.

1062
01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:20,336
- Oh, not these clowns again.
- That's right.

1063
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,120
What,
are you scared of clowns?

1064
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:25,863
I mean, obviously some of them seem
kinda creepy, but, you know, us?

1065
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:30,085
Yeah! And we're here to challenge
you, you big jabroni!

1066
01:04:30,128 --> 01:04:31,608
- Jabroni?
- You heard her.

1067
01:04:31,652 --> 01:04:34,437
I'm calling you out,
"Spentacular."

1068
01:04:34,481 --> 01:04:38,702
I'm gonna wrestle you
right here in Stoker.

1069
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:40,138
No. Yeah, right!

1070
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:45,274
Why would I wrestle a nobody
loser like you, Steve?

1071
01:04:45,318 --> 01:04:48,973
Oh. My name is not Steve.

1072
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:53,935
I'm the son of the greatest
monster wrestler of all time.

1073
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:58,374
My name is Rayburn Jr.

1074
01:04:58,418 --> 01:05:00,246
- That's...
- It can't be.

1075
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:04,032
Oh, yeah! Feel the burn...
the Rayburn!

1076
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:05,773
- Yes!
- Rayburn!

1077
01:05:07,557 --> 01:05:11,082
There is absolutely no way.
Are you kidding me?

1078
01:05:11,126 --> 01:05:13,737
Oh, I see it.

1079
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:15,043
Are you okay?

1080
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:17,741
Yeah. Felt pretty good
to get it off my chest.

1081
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:21,745
- You're Rayburn's kid?
- You bet he is.

1082
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:24,400
If you really wanna blow up
Rayburn's legacy,

1083
01:05:24,444 --> 01:05:26,184
then fight his son.

1084
01:05:26,228 --> 01:05:29,231
He's standing right in front of you.

1085
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:31,712
I would destroy you!

1086
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:33,714
Oh. Like you destroyed
King Gorge?

1087
01:05:33,757 --> 01:05:36,847
Why don't you "tell" us
all about that one.

1088
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,545
What? Oh, no.

1089
01:05:38,588 --> 01:05:41,635
What was it? The third round?
I bet we could beat that, Rayburn.

1090
01:05:41,678 --> 01:05:45,334
We said one, not three.
We were gonna go for one round.

1091
01:05:45,378 --> 01:05:47,031
I got excited.
Just go with it.

1092
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:50,948
Um, right, three.
That's right.

1093
01:05:50,992 --> 01:05:53,951
What? You think you could go
three rounds with Tentacular?

1094
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:56,911
I think we should make a bet.

1095
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:59,696
- A bet?
- We'll go three rounds with you.

1096
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,048
And if I survive,
Stoker keeps the stadium.

1097
01:06:04,092 --> 01:06:09,010
I mean, unless
you're ch-ch-ch-chicken.

1098
01:06:11,404 --> 01:06:15,277
Fine! It's on!
By the time Tentacular's done,

1099
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:19,586
there's not gonna be a thing left of
you, this town,

1100
01:06:19,629 --> 01:06:21,631
or your overrated dads.

1101
01:06:21,675 --> 01:06:24,373
Tentacular's
gonna bury it all.

1102
01:06:25,722 --> 01:06:27,071
Let's see you try.

1103
01:06:27,115 --> 01:06:30,553
Let's see you try
right here in Stoker.

1104
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,399
Incredible scenes in Stoker.
Rayburn Jr.

1105
01:06:50,443 --> 01:06:52,532
<i>That's right, son of
the legendary Rayburn...</i>

1106
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:53,924
What did he just say?

1107
01:06:59,887 --> 01:07:03,978
- Holy...
- Guacamole and chips for lunch today.

1108
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:09,200
And everyone is totally
super excited

1109
01:07:09,244 --> 01:07:13,030
for what they are calling
the match of the century.

1110
01:07:13,074 --> 01:07:15,337
- <i>And though Rayburn Jr...</i>
- Whoa!

1111
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:18,209
Steve is Rayburn Jr.!

1112
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:21,430
Big boots to fill, Marc.
Well, if he'd worn boots.

1113
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:25,391
But I'm thinking about it now, and I don't
remember him wearing boots. So scratch that.

1114
01:07:25,434 --> 01:07:28,698
<i>But for now it's goodbye
Steve the Stupendous,</i>

1115
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:31,962
<i>and hello, Rayburn Jr.!</i>

1116
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,447
Okay, the town
has come together and built

1117
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:42,495
this spectacular anti-Tentacular
agility and evasion training device,

1118
01:07:42,538 --> 01:07:46,586
otherwise known as
the Gauntlet of Doom!

1119
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,631
That's not a fun name.

1120
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:51,480
Nothing we've done comes close
to going three rounds with Tentacular.

1121
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,157
But we might just have a shot

1122
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:56,770
if you can survive the gauntlet
and reach my dad's statue.

1123
01:08:01,905 --> 01:08:02,819
Uh-oh.

1124
01:08:02,863 --> 01:08:04,734
All right, twinkle toes.

1125
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:07,389
Put on your red shoes.
Let's dance.

1126
01:08:10,784 --> 01:08:12,612
- Ooh!
- Let's do it again.

1127
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,709
The most important
thing you gotta do

1128
01:08:22,752 --> 01:08:24,580
is neutralize Tentacular's
biggest threat.

1129
01:08:24,624 --> 01:08:26,452
- His right hook.
- No, it's in his name.

1130
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,150
Oh, his tentacles.
I was gonna say his tentacles.

1131
01:08:32,283 --> 01:08:34,603
We're gonna use every trick
you learned in the underground,

1132
01:08:34,634 --> 01:08:39,508
every step you learned on your global
dance journey that you do not talk about.

1133
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:40,944
Oh, come on!

1134
01:08:40,988 --> 01:08:43,599
Every fake-out and foxtrot.

1135
01:08:47,647 --> 01:08:48,996
<i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

1136
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:50,519
The Worm.

1137
01:08:50,563 --> 01:08:52,042
Pop and lock.

1138
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,697
They say offense
is the best defense?

1139
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,483
No! Defense
is the best defense!

1140
01:08:57,526 --> 01:09:01,225
It doesn't have to look pretty.
It just has to get us through the third.

1141
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:03,489
Come on. That was pretty.

1142
01:09:03,532 --> 01:09:04,968
To survival!

1143
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:14,848
Ah-ah! You're not done yet.

1144
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,400
Am I ready now?

1145
01:09:45,443 --> 01:09:48,621
Mm-hmm.
You're ready, Rayburn.

1146
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,584
<i>Oh, yeah! I'm stoked
to be back in Stoker.</i>

1147
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:58,805
We all are!
Whoo!

1148
01:09:58,848 --> 01:10:01,634
Tonight is going to
go down in history

1149
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:03,331
as the greatest match ever

1150
01:10:03,374 --> 01:10:05,463
or the shortest,
most painful embarrassment

1151
01:10:05,507 --> 01:10:07,640
to ever happen in professional
monster wrestling.

1152
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:10,227
I'm praying it's a great match,
'cause I got something to tell you.

1153
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:13,080
I am not interested
in going home tonight.

1154
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:16,605
It sounds like
there's a story there,

1155
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:18,389
but I'm gonna have to
cut you off, Marc,

1156
01:10:18,433 --> 01:10:21,741
because I am just hearing
we're moments away

1157
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,831
from the competitors
entering the ring.

1158
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:27,877
You ready, champ?

1159
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:29,618
It's show time.

1160
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:49,551
Well, that ruined
my cool entrance.

1161
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:51,205
Ladies and gentlemen,

1162
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:55,513
World Monster Wrestling
presents a special event.

1163
01:10:55,557 --> 01:10:59,082
One stadium.
One last chance.

1164
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:00,649
Two monsters.

1165
01:11:00,693 --> 01:11:04,784
The Smackdown
to Save the Stadium!

1166
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:08,352
- Let him win!
- In this corner,

1167
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:10,877
weighing in at 22 tons,

1168
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,055
standing 43 feet tall,
from Stoker,

1169
01:11:15,098 --> 01:11:18,536
Rayburn Jr.!

1170
01:11:23,063 --> 01:11:24,194
Oh, yeah.

1171
01:11:26,066 --> 01:11:28,111
- Rayburn Jr.!
- You got this, Winnie!

1172
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:30,113
Hey, everybody.

1173
01:11:30,157 --> 01:11:32,899
I know her!
She eats in my diner!

1174
01:11:32,942 --> 01:11:35,031
Look at
the confidence, Marc.

1175
01:11:35,075 --> 01:11:37,207
Somebody's gotta
say this about Rayburn Jr.

1176
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:41,385
We know he's audacious, he's courageous,
but three rounds with Tentacular?

1177
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:43,910
What is he thinking?
He might be losing his monster mind.

1178
01:11:43,953 --> 01:11:47,827
- I just don't know.
- There is so much riding on him tonight.

1179
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,656
Let's not forget to mention
that in his corner

1180
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:53,615
is the young rookie coach
Winnie Coyle.

1181
01:11:53,659 --> 01:11:58,402
That's right: daughter of the
legendary coach Jimbo Coyle.

1182
01:11:58,446 --> 01:12:01,318
Winnie, no matter
what happens tonight,

1183
01:12:01,362 --> 01:12:04,234
your father would be
so proud of you.

1184
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,714
Thanks, Mom.

1185
01:12:07,063 --> 01:12:10,284
And now,
in his return to Stoker,

1186
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:14,288
the undefeated reigning
holder of the Big Belt:

1187
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:17,291
Tentacular!

1188
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:20,773
What's going on, Stoker?

1189
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:22,557
Oh, you miss this?

1190
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,124
Forget about it!

1191
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:26,866
'Cause you ain't ever seeing
one of these again.

1192
01:12:33,394 --> 01:12:35,613
Ray, you okay?

1193
01:12:35,657 --> 01:12:37,833
Rayburn!
Are you with me?

1194
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,882
I am literally terrified.

1195
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,624
I don't think I can do this.
I can't be him.

1196
01:12:46,668 --> 01:12:48,888
No, you can't.

1197
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:51,934
But we don't have to
be our dads.

1198
01:12:51,978 --> 01:12:55,416
We just have to be ourselves.
You showed me that.

1199
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:59,725
They wrote their stories,
and we're writing ours right now.

1200
01:12:59,768 --> 01:13:03,511
And, yeah, maybe theirs was all
dramatic and super serious,

1201
01:13:03,554 --> 01:13:07,602
and maybe ours is more like
a slapstick comedy.

1202
01:13:07,645 --> 01:13:08,821
Oh, I love those.

1203
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:11,345
Me too.
Especially ones about friends.

1204
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:16,045
So, are you ready to go out there
and look ridiculous tonight?

1205
01:13:16,089 --> 01:13:17,960
- Yes.
- How ridiculous?

1206
01:13:18,004 --> 01:13:20,006
Very, very ridiculous!

1207
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:21,964
- And do we care?
- We don't care.

1208
01:13:22,008 --> 01:13:23,618
Uh, I can't hear you.

1209
01:13:23,661 --> 01:13:25,402
We do not care!

1210
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:28,275
Now, buck up,
put your game face on,

1211
01:13:28,318 --> 01:13:31,713
because it's time
to wrestle.

1212
01:13:31,757 --> 01:13:33,759
And dance. Both!

1213
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,546
Whoa. Time out.
Was that a coach speech?

1214
01:13:38,589 --> 01:13:40,983
Man,
I feel so inspired!

1215
01:13:41,027 --> 01:13:42,463
- You do?
- Yeah.

1216
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:44,291
You should've done that
before every match.

1217
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:47,250
All right, wrestlers,
to the center of the ring.

1218
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,426
Okay, let's go make it
through the third.

1219
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,777
And if you live,
let's get froyo afterwards.

1220
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,910
Oh, I love froyo.
Wait, if I live?

1221
01:13:54,954 --> 01:13:57,217
Okay, champ,
let's get this over quick.

1222
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,220
I got a hot date at the Kaiju
Lodge with Edna.

1223
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,659
I want a good, clean match,

1224
01:14:04,702 --> 01:14:06,617
and obey my rules
at all times.

1225
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:09,882
Okay, touch appendages
and come out wrestling.

1226
01:14:11,318 --> 01:14:13,146
Ow! Ow!

1227
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:22,895
Let's dan...

1228
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,942
Guess I'm going home.

1229
01:14:26,986 --> 01:14:28,291
Looks that way, Marc.

1230
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:30,293
- Yeah!
- What? I'm texting.

1231
01:14:30,337 --> 01:14:32,121
Oh, did we win?
Should I celebrate?

1232
01:14:32,165 --> 01:14:34,558
No, wait. I'm up.

1233
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:38,301
That was a good shot.
Kind of lucky, but I'm all right.

1234
01:14:39,172 --> 01:14:40,434
What?

1235
01:14:41,217 --> 01:14:43,176
What are you waiting for?
Go get him.

1236
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:45,874
Oh, come on.
Really? Really?

1237
01:14:45,918 --> 01:14:47,441
Rayburn isn't even
trying to wrestle.

1238
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,530
He thinks he's gonna dance
his way through this.

1239
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:53,534
It would appear that way, Marc.
And I gotta say it's working.

1240
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:56,363
Watch his hands,
not his shimmering salsa feet!

1241
01:14:56,406 --> 01:15:01,194
- Yes! That's it!
- Really? We came out here for this?

1242
01:15:01,237 --> 01:15:03,979
Look at that!
Tentacular can't get near him!

1243
01:15:04,023 --> 01:15:05,981
Look out!

1244
01:15:06,025 --> 01:15:07,853
Missed again.

1245
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:12,205
Here we go!
Oh, there it is!

1246
01:15:12,248 --> 01:15:14,555
- Watch the tentacles!
- What?

1247
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,861
Oh, and he gets away.

1248
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:17,732
- Oh! Right into the post!
- Yes!

1249
01:15:17,775 --> 01:15:19,865
I can't believe
what I'm seeing.

1250
01:15:19,908 --> 01:15:23,129
Rayburn hasn't landed a single
blow, and he's still in the match.

1251
01:15:23,172 --> 01:15:24,608
Take that, traitor!

1252
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:29,744
Tonight's special:
fried calamari!

1253
01:15:29,787 --> 01:15:33,182
Tentacular is seething mad,
and I don't blame him one bit.

1254
01:15:33,226 --> 01:15:35,271
I mean, can we have
our money back?

1255
01:15:35,315 --> 01:15:38,884
Yeah, I really hate to sit here and say
that you're right about anything, Marc,

1256
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:42,626
but I'm not even sure we can call this
a monster wrestling match right now.

1257
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:46,282
We're doing this.
We're actually doing this.

1258
01:15:46,326 --> 01:15:48,981
Hey, stay focused.
We're not ordering froyo yet.

1259
01:15:49,024 --> 01:15:51,766
Okay, champ, he thinks he's
got us with his sweet moves,

1260
01:15:51,809 --> 01:15:54,900
but he don't know
we got a few moves of our own.

1261
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:56,902
Why don't we ask him
to dance?

1262
01:15:56,945 --> 01:15:58,599
Don't mind if I do.

1263
01:16:02,603 --> 01:16:05,780
Come on, Rayburn!
Dance around him, not with him!

1264
01:16:05,823 --> 01:16:08,348
Looks like Siggy's
done his homework.

1265
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:10,698
Is that a Paso Doble
step routine?

1266
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:13,266
They're both dancing now.
Good grief.

1267
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:15,398
I can't take this.
I can't take this.

1268
01:16:15,442 --> 01:16:18,749
Look at Tentacular go!

1269
01:16:18,793 --> 01:16:20,403
Attaboy!

1270
01:16:20,447 --> 01:16:23,145
What a sweet move.

1271
01:16:23,189 --> 01:16:25,147
- I'm not watching.
- There it is!

1272
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:28,672
- Don't let him corner you! Get out there!
- This match is over.

1273
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:30,587
Not yet.

1274
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:33,262
I don't know what we're watching
at this point, but you know what?

1275
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:35,810
I like it. I like it a lot.

1276
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:39,292
- Maybe more than monster wrestling.
- Oh, come on!

1277
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:41,903
Oh, man.

1278
01:16:41,947 --> 01:16:47,126
Tentacular is all over him
like a bad rash right now.

1279
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:52,783
Ah, this is too easy.

1280
01:16:52,827 --> 01:16:55,177
You like that, Stoker? Bam!

1281
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,922
Suplex!

1282
01:17:00,966 --> 01:17:02,880
Oh, this is a massacre.

1283
01:17:02,924 --> 01:17:06,014
The ref's gonna have to
step in and stop this.

1284
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:07,276
Rayburn, heads up!

1285
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,799
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

1286
01:17:08,843 --> 01:17:11,541
It's a wrap, y'all.
This match is over.

1287
01:17:19,462 --> 01:17:21,856
You're an
embarrassment to your dad's name!

1288
01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:25,773
You come out this next
round, I'm gonna end you,

1289
01:17:25,816 --> 01:17:29,907
then bury what's left under
the ruins of the stadium.

1290
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:33,476
All right, that's the bell!
Break it up, break it up!

1291
01:17:36,175 --> 01:17:37,828
Tentacular didn't want
that round to end.

1292
01:17:37,872 --> 01:17:39,700
I can't see this lasting
much longer, Mac.

1293
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:42,790
All he has to do
is hold on for this

1294
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:45,358
one last round,
and he saves the stadium.

1295
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:47,099
Not happening, Mac.

1296
01:17:47,142 --> 01:17:51,146
Tentacular's about to destroy Rayburn Jr.
You can book that.

1297
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:53,931
Winnie, listen to me.
This ain't good.

1298
01:17:53,975 --> 01:17:56,847
There's no stopping T when
he smells blood in the water.

1299
01:17:56,891 --> 01:17:59,763
I'm begging you,
don't put Ray-Ray back out there.

1300
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:03,767
You wanna be a real coach?
Think of your monster first.

1301
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:12,515
It's over.

1302
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:15,388
Winnie Coyle
is throwing in the towel.

1303
01:18:15,431 --> 01:18:17,216
Wait. What are you doing?

1304
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,653
It's just a building, Ray.

1305
01:18:21,002 --> 01:18:22,786
Winnie. Ray-Ray.

1306
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,701
I want you to remember:

1307
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:27,791
This stadium
isn't your dads' legacy.

1308
01:18:28,575 --> 01:18:29,619
You are.

1309
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:39,281
Who's chicken now, huh?
You're nothing, you hear me!

1310
01:18:39,325 --> 01:18:41,892
You'll always be nothing!

1311
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:48,421
We love you, Rayburn Jr.!

1312
01:18:50,249 --> 01:18:51,380
I wanna keep going.

1313
01:18:51,424 --> 01:18:54,601
No. Ray, it's not worth it.

1314
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:56,124
Yes, it is.

1315
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:59,388
But we're gonna have to try
a radical new strategy.

1316
01:18:59,432 --> 01:19:01,086
You ready for it?

1317
01:19:01,129 --> 01:19:03,131
- Try to win.
- To win.

1318
01:19:03,175 --> 01:19:04,741
We gotta take
the fight to him.

1319
01:19:04,785 --> 01:19:07,222
He can't hit me
if I'm hitting him, right?

1320
01:19:07,266 --> 01:19:08,919
- Right.
- It's just one round.

1321
01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:12,271
We can do this,
but you've gotta do something for me.

1322
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:15,230
- Anything.
- You gotta coach me up.

1323
01:19:15,274 --> 01:19:17,319
Are you coming back out?

1324
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:21,628
Hey, Siggy.
We're not quite done.

1325
01:19:21,671 --> 01:19:22,933
Oh, yeah.

1326
01:19:22,977 --> 01:19:24,805
Hmm?

1327
01:19:29,636 --> 01:19:32,769
Wait a second.
It looks like Rayburn's gonna fight on.

1328
01:19:32,813 --> 01:19:35,424
I am not sure
that's a good idea.

1329
01:19:35,468 --> 01:19:38,471
Are you serious right now?
I cannot believe this.

1330
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:41,909
Tell me when it's over, Marc.
I can't watch.

1331
01:19:41,952 --> 01:19:43,519
Do it for Stoker!

1332
01:19:43,563 --> 01:19:46,435
Then combine the Renegade
with the Roundhouse Tail Whip,

1333
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,350
and if he anticipates
and gets a hold of you,

1334
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:51,527
hit him as hard as you can
right in the tentacles.

1335
01:19:51,571 --> 01:19:55,618
Just to be clear,
you are saying "tentacles," right?

1336
01:19:55,662 --> 01:19:57,794
Yeah. Tentacles. Okay.

1337
01:19:57,838 --> 01:20:00,797
Everything you need to win
is in here,

1338
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:02,886
in here and in here.

1339
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,845
You got this.

1340
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,717
You should've stayed down,
chump!

1341
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,980
You don't know what
you've got yourself into!

1342
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:17,988
- Yes!
- What is this?

1343
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:20,904
Rayburn knocked the champ down!
I can't believe it!

1344
01:20:20,948 --> 01:20:22,558
It's on.

1345
01:20:22,602 --> 01:20:25,474
It's almost like we
finally got a wrestling match.

1346
01:20:25,518 --> 01:20:28,216
Come on, Rayburn!

1347
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,741
Now they're actually going
toe-to-toe, like it's supposed to be.

1348
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:34,004
Come on, huh?
What are we waiting for?

1349
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,182
He shouldn't even be in the same
ring with you. Throw this bum out.

1350
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:39,227
No, no, no!
Don't let him in so close!

1351
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:41,142
That's what
I'm talking about.

1352
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:43,188
Time to shut
this dance club down.

1353
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:45,320
Oh!
That can't feel good!

1354
01:20:45,364 --> 01:20:47,104
- Yeah!
- No, it didn't.

1355
01:20:47,148 --> 01:20:50,847
Rayburn! Don't play his game.
Feel the rhythm.

1356
01:20:50,891 --> 01:20:54,938
Well, this is way more of
a match than we were expecting.

1357
01:20:54,982 --> 01:20:57,090
Come on, Rayburn.
Let me see those sweet feet.

1358
01:20:57,114 --> 01:20:59,528
Coach Winnie's invented
a whole new style of wrestling,

1359
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:01,118
and Tentacular
can't deal with it.

1360
01:21:01,162 --> 01:21:02,990
He looks completely lost.

1361
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:05,906
- I'm seeing ghosts out there, Sig!
- He's making a joke out of us.

1362
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:08,300
- He switches it up every time.
- T, look out!

1363
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:10,389
Rayburn,
out of nowhere.

1364
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,391
He's on his heels.
Keep it up!

1365
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:15,176
Oh, this is special.
I've never seen a match like this before.

1366
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:18,832
Slams him down. Oh, but Rayburn
comes back with the clothesline.

1367
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,897
I'm not saying I was wrong,
because I'm never wrong,

1368
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:24,707
but I may not have been entirely
correct about these kids.

1369
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,275
I mean,
this is truly incredible.

1370
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:29,799
I never thought
I would see the day

1371
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,846
that Marc admitted he was
wrong about something.

1372
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:34,804
First time for everything.

1373
01:21:36,328 --> 01:21:38,678
The round's almost over!
Just hold on!

1374
01:21:38,721 --> 01:21:41,289
Holding on is the only thing
I'm doing!

1375
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:44,814
Oh, no.
Tentacular has got him.

1376
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,990
Oh, the piledriver!

1377
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:50,646
- What? He's back up?
- He's spinning like a B-boy!

1378
01:21:51,386 --> 01:21:53,606
But Tentacular
was ready for it.

1379
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,958
This is not looking good
for Rayburn.

1380
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:03,093
- Suckers!
- What?

1381
01:22:03,137 --> 01:22:06,749
- The suckers!
- Oh!

1382
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:10,100
- Sucker!
- What is this?

1383
01:22:10,144 --> 01:22:13,626
Rayburn
landed a huge blow there.

1384
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:15,410
Okay, Ray,
make this count!

1385
01:22:15,454 --> 01:22:17,499
I got this, Winnie.

1386
01:22:17,543 --> 01:22:20,173
I can't believe it! Tentacular
actually looks like he's in trouble!

1387
01:22:20,197 --> 01:22:21,938
Come on!

1388
01:22:33,254 --> 01:22:35,300
Huh?

1389
01:22:38,172 --> 01:22:40,957
Why?

1390
01:22:50,619 --> 01:22:53,666
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

1391
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:55,450
Oh! They're both down!

1392
01:22:55,494 --> 01:22:56,843
No! Rayburn!

1393
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,325
- One.
- Come on, champ.

1394
01:23:00,368 --> 01:23:02,196
- Get up.
- Two.

1395
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,850
Come on, Rayburn, get up!

1396
01:23:03,893 --> 01:23:05,634
- Three.
- Get up.

1397
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:07,288
Four.

1398
01:23:07,332 --> 01:23:09,334
He's done, T.

1399
01:23:09,377 --> 01:23:11,336
Five.

1400
01:23:11,379 --> 01:23:12,598
Come on, Rayburn.

1401
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:14,817
- Get up!
- Come on, Rayburn!

1402
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:18,952
- Get up! Oh!
- Come on! Do it for Stoker!

1403
01:23:31,356 --> 01:23:34,359
Come on! Everybody!

1404
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:57,251
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah! Feel the burn!

1405
01:23:57,294 --> 01:24:00,515
Oh, my goodness, Rayburn is up!
I can't believe it!

1406
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:02,735
What is even happening
right now?

1407
01:24:09,219 --> 01:24:12,440
Oh! Rayburn psyched him out!
Are you kidding me?

1408
01:24:12,484 --> 01:24:14,877
Looks like we're all tied up.

1409
01:24:21,493 --> 01:24:25,322
Rayburn's got him with a Tentacle
Whip. The champ's up against the ropes.

1410
01:24:25,366 --> 01:24:27,063
Come on! Now!

1411
01:24:27,107 --> 01:24:30,806
Get ready for the Moon Boom!

1412
01:24:35,594 --> 01:24:38,292
Rayburn slammed him!
And the champ is down!

1413
01:24:38,335 --> 01:24:41,077
One. Two. Three.

1414
01:24:41,121 --> 01:24:42,165
Champ, get up!

1415
01:24:42,209 --> 01:24:44,167
Four. Five.

1416
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:45,430
- Six.
- Six.

1417
01:24:45,473 --> 01:24:46,692
- Seven.
- Seven.

1418
01:24:46,735 --> 01:24:48,433
- I can't watch!
- Eight.

1419
01:24:48,476 --> 01:24:49,782
- Nine!
- Nine!

1420
01:24:49,825 --> 01:24:51,479
- Get up, T!
- Ten! You're out!

1421
01:24:51,523 --> 01:24:54,569
Oh, my goodness! This is incredible!

1422
01:24:54,613 --> 01:24:56,919
Rayburn Jr. has done it!
I'm speechless!

1423
01:24:56,963 --> 01:24:59,922
- Yes!
- That's my girl! Yep, I'm her mom.

1424
01:24:59,966 --> 01:25:01,489
And that's her monster!

1425
01:25:01,533 --> 01:25:03,273
- Fred.
- What? We won?

1426
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:07,103
Whoo! Ha, ha!

1427
01:25:07,147 --> 01:25:09,889
Oh, we did it!
I'm gonna get reelected!

1428
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:15,634
Fried calamari
for everybody!

1429
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:19,246
Wait, what?
No, he didn't beat me!

1430
01:25:19,289 --> 01:25:20,856
No!

1431
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,338
Whoa! Our little Stevie
won, Klonk!

1432
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:25,600
I'm so proud.

1433
01:25:25,644 --> 01:25:28,081
- Winnie.
- I know, Mom.

1434
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:31,476
Winnie, we did it!
We saved the stadium!

1435
01:25:31,519 --> 01:25:33,608
You sure did, champ.

1436
01:25:35,044 --> 01:25:37,656
Champ? Champ?

1437
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,788
- Champ!
- And now,

1438
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:43,531
the new holder
of the Big Belt,

1439
01:25:43,575 --> 01:25:49,189
Rayburn Jr.!

1440
01:25:50,364 --> 01:25:52,888
- Hey, Winnie.
- Uh, hey, Siggy.

1441
01:25:52,932 --> 01:25:57,066
I was wrong. You got a heck
of a monster there, Winnie.

1442
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,678
And he's got
a heck of a coach.

1443
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:04,509
Thanks, Siggy.

1444
01:26:12,691 --> 01:26:14,606
Hey, big guy,
get on over here.

1445
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:18,000
You just pulled off the greatest upset
in the history of monster wrestling.

1446
01:26:18,044 --> 01:26:21,569
- How do you feel?
- I feel like...

1447
01:26:21,613 --> 01:26:22,831
- dancing!
- Dancing!

1448
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,920
Really?

1449
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,099
Oh, yeah!

1450
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,536
Whoo-hoo!

1451
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:05,091
I'm okay,
for those who were worried.

1452
01:27:39,647 --> 01:27:41,040
Yeah!

1453
01:27:51,485 --> 01:27:53,226
Shake it! Yeah!

1454
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:54,749
Whoo-hoo!

1455
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:56,621
Check the lady out!

1456
01:27:56,664 --> 01:27:58,057
Whoo!

1457
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,982
Here we go! Yeah!

1458
01:28:20,688 --> 01:28:22,168
Ow!

1459
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,533
That was
way too much froyo.

1460
01:28:39,576 --> 01:28:41,666
Oh! I got
a serious brain freeze.

1461
01:28:42,841 --> 01:28:45,713
Training tomorrow,
6:00 a.m.

1462
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:48,237
And body freeze.

1463
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,371
Serious body freeze.
That's an actual thing. It's medical.

1464
01:28:51,414 --> 01:28:54,069
Don't know
if I'll be able to make it.
