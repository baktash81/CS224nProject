1
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,884
<i>Here in the upstate, things don't
change much.</i>

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,617
<i>Fall means football season.</i>

3
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,287
<i>Being married to a coach
means measuring things...</i>

4
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>...mainly by wins and losses.</i>

5
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,199
<i>Except for that one year.</i>

6
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,561
<i>Jimmy Carter declared
that if elected...</i>

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,038
<i>...he would do everything possible
to clean up the government.</i>

8
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,645
<i>In South Carolina weather, late night
and early morning low clouds....</i>

9
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,270
-Come on, let's go.
-No, Mom.

10
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,259
What's wrong with you, boy?!
Get out of my way!

11
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,960
Damn!

12
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,593
Laird, son, how many years
you been playing for me?

13
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,494
-Two years, coach.
-You want to make that three?

14
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,604
-l suggest you start paying attention.
-Yes, sir.

15
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,000
We do things as a team, gentlemen.

16
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,709
One player doesn't execute, it's the
difference between 6 yards or 6 points.

17
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,348
Honeycutt, what say we do
some up-downs as a team...

18
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,986
...so we can further appreciate
that concept.

19
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,988
You heard the man!
Get them feet chopping now!

20
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,224
Get it up nice! Get those knees up!

21
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,724
Get them legs going!

22
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,064
Get it up!
Get it up, right now!

23
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,715
Come on, get them up! Get them up!
Get them up!

24
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,789
Let's go! Come on, now!

25
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,667
Hey, you.

26
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,609
Now, might any of those X's and O's
be for me tonight?

27
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,213
-How's it coming?
-Almost done.

28
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,888
Mary Helen home yet?

29
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,165
Mary Helen's been in bed
for an hour, Harold.

30
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,206
Y'all do have a week before you
actually have to play this game, right?

31
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,205
-Right.
-l'll be right up.

32
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,805
Ah, the first ''l'll be right up''
of the season.

33
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,142
<i>Ready! Set!</i>

34
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,709
<i>Hut!</i>

35
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,108
Let's go, now.

36
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,822
Team, full speed! Live to the ball!

37
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,358
Ready!

38
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,798
Blue, 2 4!

39
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,228
Set!

40
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,785
Hey, Einstein. Why don't you try
picking the ball up.

41
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,358
Yeah, you, dummy. What, you deaf?

42
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,552
Yeah, pick it up. There you go.

43
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,895
Throw it over here.

44
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,462
Come on, throw it!

45
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,568
What are you doing? Hey, coach!

46
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,909
He took our ball.

47
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,737
Wha--?

48
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,146
Run it again!

49
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,502
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay. See you later, Mary Helen.

50
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,138
Bye.

51
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,647
You're getting home late.

52
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,788
Oh, hey, Daddy.

53
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,287
l tried calling a couple times,
but the line was busy.

54
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,925
Your mama's asleep.

55
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,493
l'll talk to her in the morning, okay?

56
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,386
All right.

57
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,797
-Night.
-Good night.

58
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,267
Heard Mary Helen made
varsity cheerleader.

59
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,309
-She's really excited.
-l'll bet. l'll bet Linda is too.

60
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,377
Yeah, l guess so.

61
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,946
Do it again!

62
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,719
-One more time!
-You got them running something?

63
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,876
Hit it!

64
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,184
Come on, dope.

65
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,222
-Hey, boy!
-Watch this. Watch this.

66
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,763
-Bring them in.
-Gather up! On the double!

67
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,566
Well, is someone gonna
tell me what's going on here?

68
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,649
How about it, Johnny?

69
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,746
Nobody move.

70
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,481
On, no, no, no, no.

71
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,254
Oh, gee.

72
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,963
l just want to help you.

73
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,238
l'm just gonna cut the tape off you.

74
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,837
You've gotta hold still.
Just try to hold still, now.

75
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,345
You gotta hold still. Look at me.

76
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,486
Hold still. l'm not gonna hurt you.
Hold still. l don't want to cut you.

77
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,850
My God. lt's all right.

78
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,958
Calm down a little bit. lt's okay.

79
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,857
l got it. Gonna get you
out of this mess.

80
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,588
Okay, you're free.

81
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,044
Anybody got anything to say?

82
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,120
Tell your folks practice's gonna
run late tomorrow.

83
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,005
Mary Helen tells me the cheerleading
squad's got itself...

84
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,904
...what, half-a-dozen new faces
this semester, isn't that right?

85
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,369
l also hear the athletic director...

86
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,607
...has to take the top spot
on the pyramid at pep rallies.

87
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,580
lsn't that right?

88
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,749
Harold, why not stop by and see what
kind of no-good your daughter's up to?

89
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,946
Yeah, sure.

90
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,322
You got a couple phone calls, Daddy.

91
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,890
From who?

92
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,966
Bobby Taggert's folks. Frank Clay.
l wrote them down for you.

93
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,003
-What'd you tell them?
-That you'd call back.

94
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,510
Have you decided what you're
gonna do about these boys?

95
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,247
Not yet.

96
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,213
l'm sure most of them have never
done anything like this before.

97
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,051
You didn't see the look
on this young man's face, Linda.

98
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,256
He was terrified.

99
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,270
Coach Jones?

100
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,235
Go on. Good idea.

101
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,470
Might l have a minute of your time?

102
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,272
Y'all, excuse me.

103
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,582
Anybody ever said no to you on that,
Principal Daniels?

104
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,915
Nobody still working here.

105
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,458
He scores!

106
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,854
-What can l do for you?
-l hear we had an incident yesterday.

107
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,465
Yes, ma'am, we did.

108
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,294
You taking care of it?

109
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,530
Let's just say today's practice won't be
the shortest one we've ever had.

110
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,833
Good. Good.

111
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,102
You know, Harold...

112
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,146
...that boy has been rolling by here
for a long time now...

113
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,839
...minding his own business.

114
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,179
Never caused any problem
for anybody.

115
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,856
l need you all to keep it that way.

116
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,084
l appreciate it.

117
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,127
No, l don't want the football.

118
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,499
l just want to tell you l'm sorry
about what happened.

119
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,773
l thought you needed to hear that
from someone.

120
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,570
l don't want the football.
You keep it.

121
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,909
Why don't you bring it by practice
later.

122
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,210
l'll find you something to do.
Maybe you can help us out.

123
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,984
Nothing more is gonna happen, son.

124
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,752
l promise you.

125
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,925
See you later. All right?

126
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,661
All right, the nine of you.

127
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,591
You know who you are.

128
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,756
Get on down there.

129
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,130
Take your shoulder pads off.
Line up on the chalk.

130
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,201
Let's go. Hustle up!

131
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,969
Well...

132
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,337
...what do you want to do?

133
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,241
Run them.

134
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,944
How long?

135
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,542
Till l say stop.

136
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,859
On the line now!
Where you're going to be.

137
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,350
Ready.

138
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,459
All the way to the line, coach.

139
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,047
Don't quit on me now!
Don't you quit on me!

140
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,020
All the way through that line!
All the way through!

141
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,826
-Hi.
-Hey.

142
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,172
-Long day?
-Yeah.

143
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,072
How was yours?

144
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,978
Long.

145
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,283
So the report is that Mary Helen
got off to a great start in lit class...

146
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,553
-...but she's struggling with math.
-Well, the lit part sounds good.

147
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,194
Come on, Harold.

148
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,892
lt's bad enough when a parent
misses a conference.

149
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,196
lt's worse when the parent's
a teacher.

150
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,863
The parent's a teacher,
he knows how his kid's doing.

151
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,702
What?

152
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,548
Please just tell me
that you forgot to go.

153
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,083
You know l had to deal
with those boys.

154
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,187
Oh, those boys.

155
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,387
Can't you make room
for your daughter and those boys?

156
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,962
Don't lecture me. l'll go see Ms. Marks
tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.

157
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,599
Make me feel better?
This is not about me.

158
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,129
She's a junior, Harold.

159
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:51,069
l mean, she's got this year
and next.

160
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,267
And then she's gone.

161
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,251
Go!

162
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,750
-Y'all ready?
-Yes, sir!

163
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,260
Yes, sir!

164
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,654
Close your eyes for a minute.

165
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,258
l want you to listen.

166
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,136
You hear that?

167
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,771
lmagine what that'll sound like
after we've all done our job tonight.

168
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,775
And then...

169
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,242
...l want you to imagine what
that's gonna feel like.

170
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,652
l want you to picture your man
right across from you.

171
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,187
You see him?

172
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,490
You make the effort on every play,
you'll beat them.

173
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,790
You play smart,
you're gonna outthink them.

174
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,263
You play with heart and character...

175
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,493
...and give your teammates everything
you've got on every play...

176
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,368
...you can walk off the field calling
yourselves a football team.

177
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,880
Let's play with Hanna pride and never
stop believing in each other.

178
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,078
You win your battles...

179
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,416
...we'll win our war.

180
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,717
What's say let's have some fun
and get it done.

181
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,854
<i>Your Hanna Yellow Jackets!</i>

182
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,660
Let's go, Jackets!

183
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,962
<i>The kickoff is high and deep...</i>

184
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,802
<i>...and sends the Jackets' Johnny Clay
back near the goal line.</i>

185
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,213
<i>Johnny Clay behind a convoy of Hanna
blockers. Heads up the right sideline.</i>

186
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,848
Go! Go! Go! Go!

187
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,372
Get up there!

188
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,042
<i>Finally knocked out-of-bounds
at the 42-yard line.</i>

189
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,314
Throw right 63 flag. Come on.

190
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,479
Come on!

191
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,386
<i>First and 1 0 for the Jackets.</i>

192
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,325
<i>Marcum back to pass.</i>

193
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,826
<i>Finds Hawkins in the right flat
for another Jacket first down.</i>

194
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,260
Get over here. Come on. Come on.

195
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,529
Thirty-six crossbuck.

196
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,604
Once you get the ball, l don't wanna
see nothing but the back of your jersey.

197
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,604
All right. Get out there.

198
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,041
<i>The handoff is to Clay.</i>

199
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:10,409
<i>Finds a big hole. Now cuts outside.
Beats one tackler. And another.</i>

200
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,279
<i>-Get upfield, son. Turn it on!
-He may go all the way.</i>

201
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,546
<i>-Touchdown, Hanna!
-Yeah! All right.</i>

202
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,983
<i>Johnny Clay with a 30-yard run
gives the Jackets the lead!</i>

203
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,328
<i>-Less than two minutes to play.
-That's what we want.</i>

204
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,830
That's a 30-yard run, son!

205
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,766
That's our ball game!
That's our ball game!

206
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,860
-Evening, fellas.
-Hey, coach.

207
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,693
-Harold.
-Honeycutt.

208
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,368
Del. Don.

209
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,869
Kurt. Dennis.

210
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,100
Just brewed that pot 1 0 minutes ago,
coach. Got yourself the first cup.

211
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,504
All right.

212
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,106
Well...

213
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,054
...didn't exactly thump them...

214
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,056
...but it wasn't too bad
as far as season openers go.

215
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,785
Frank, your boy, Johnny,
had a heck of a run.

216
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,454
Give him the ball,
he'll make you a smart man.

217
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,788
That's right.

218
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,900
Did notice a few things
we need to work on.

219
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,470
You reckon these are the boys
gonna take us back to state?

220
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,109
Come on, Clive. Little early
for that kind of talk, isn't it?

221
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,404
l hear Easley has a pretty
decent crop of speed this year.

222
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,980
l guess we'll see about that
next week.

223
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,810
Think you might want to throw
the ball a bit more?

224
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,613
l think about a lot of things.

225
00:20:55,821 --> 00:21:00,986
Listen, boys. Last thing coach needs
is us asking him a slew of questions.

226
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,594
Especially after how he got
those young men to play.

227
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,593
We got them revved up, didn't we?

228
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,825
So how do you plan on beating those
Easley boys Friday night?

229
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,798
Well, Frank, if l was to tell you
that...

230
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,168
...y'all wouldn't have a thing to talk
about all week.

231
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,045
Boy, that's a good cup tonight, Del.

232
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,411
Thank you.

233
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,886
Come on, turn it up! Turn it up!
Turn it up!

234
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,725
Good job! Good job!

235
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,630
Hey, Honeycutt.

236
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,027
Yeah?

237
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,795
See that young man over there?

238
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,932
What do you figure he wants?

239
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,698
l don't know.

240
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,411
Come on, Spaulding,
bring it around there!

241
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,780
l think maybe he's thirsty.

242
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,248
Well, go on.

243
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,490
All right. Five minutes.

244
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,361
Get yourself a drink.
Get on special teams.

245
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,974
How you doing?

246
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,475
Yeah, you. No, wait, wait.
lt's all right.

247
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,977
Settle down. l ain't gonna
give you a hug.

248
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,174
Just got a little water here. See?

249
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,843
l'm dropping something off here.

250
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,985
Little something from Coach Jones.

251
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,748
Got a name, son?

252
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,189
You ain't gonna talk to me, are you?

253
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,094
All right.

254
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,894
Go ahead. Go on, give it a squeeze.

255
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,004
Set! Hut!

256
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,579
-Come on, now!
-Good job, Justin.

257
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,452
All right, bring it in!

258
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,464
Hi.

259
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,531
Glad you came by.

260
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,808
Thank you. What's your name?

261
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,384
Why don't you come on in.

262
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,223
l got some hamburgers coming.

263
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,230
Get your buggy. Come on in.

264
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,884
Really good burgers.

265
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,213
Oh, you found some music
you like. Good.

266
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,592
Hey, look who's here.

267
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,226
No ketchup, no onion.

268
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,625
Thank you.

269
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,599
-He tell you his name yet?
-He doesn't talk too much.

270
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,738
But he's sure taken a liking
to that radio of yours.

271
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,809
Radio.

272
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,911
Radio, huh?

273
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,751
You know, it's just sitting there.

274
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,321
You can have it as far
as l'm concerned.

275
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,048
Hey, you hear that...

276
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,056
...Radio?

277
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,858
Coach Honeycutt says you can take
that home with you if you like.

278
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,491
Hey, are you hungry?

279
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,099
Would you like a hambur--?

280
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:48,202
You want something to wash it
down with too? Root beer? Coke?

281
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,006
Coke.

282
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,952
-Man knows what he wants.
-Coke, it is.

283
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,470
Well...

284
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,476
...which way's home, Radio?

285
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,638
There's nothing wrong
with a good country station.

286
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,443
But l can get used to this too,
l guess.

287
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,757
You know, the boys call me
Coach Jones.

288
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,286
Coach Jones.

289
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,592
You can call me what you like
when you get around to it.

290
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,259
All right?

291
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,721
l hope you can come by practice
tomorrow.

292
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,591
The same time. All right?

293
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,406
See you then, okay?

294
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,672
Afternoon, ma'am.

295
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,544
l'm Harold Jones. l coach the football
team over at Hanna High.

296
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,847
l was just giving your boy
a ride home.

297
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,857
Come on in now, baby.

298
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,715
Look.

299
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,151
Hey.

300
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,415
-Hello.
-Yeah.

301
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,720
-Look.
-l see you got yourself another one.

302
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,988
Look.

303
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,992
Oh, look at that.

304
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,560
You get that from him?

305
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,203
Yeah. Coach Jones.

306
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,235
Look at that one.

307
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,377
He a nice man?

308
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,614
Yeah.

309
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,773
Good.

310
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,282
l think it's time you got washed up
for dinner. You hungry?

311
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,891
-Yeah.
-l made you some fried bread.

312
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,962
All right. Get yourself washed up
for dinner.

313
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,271
Set!

314
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,499
Set!

315
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,265
Get in there! Get in there!

316
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,238
Bring it in! Come on, hustle up!
Let's go.

317
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,574
Come on, hustle up!

318
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,941
Bring it in. Good job. Good job.
Good practice, men.

319
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,747
We got a lot to think about this week.

320
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,389
Easley's got a ton of speed.

321
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:58,453
Defense, containment. We gotta
keep them from getting outside.

322
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,861
Offense, ball control. We'll grind it
out, keep their offense off the field.

323
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,697
Now, there's one other thing.

324
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,771
See the young man over there?

325
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,744
Believe some of you already
know him. He goes by Radio.

326
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,137
He'll be helping us out for a while.

327
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,876
We will not have a problem with that.

328
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,712
No, sir.

329
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,046
Call it up, Danny.

330
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,357
-One, two, three!
-Beat Easley!

331
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,030
-What's he doing?
-That's it. Get your knees up.

332
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,973
Look at him out there.

333
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,805
That one! That one!
That one!

334
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,206
Careful.

335
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,116
Sorry.

336
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,056
l'm sorry, Johnny.

337
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,750
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Johnny.
l'm sorry.

338
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:04,984
You okay.

339
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,361
Hanna!

340
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,561
Hanna!

341
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,898
Hanna!

342
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,910
What the hell is going on out there?

343
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,515
<i>Yellow Jackets still looking to
get on track. Marcum back to pass.</i>

344
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,208
<i>Intercepted!</i>

345
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,399
Don't quit! Don't quit!
Don't quit!

346
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,838
Go! Go!

347
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,925
That was a good one.
l liked that one.

348
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,601
Radio!

349
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,702
Hi, everybody. Hi, everybody.
Hi, everybody.

350
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,208
Quite a show you put on tonight.

351
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:10,353
Just wondering if you were running
a football program or a social club.

352
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,539
Radio, l need to talk to your mama.
That okay?

353
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,508
She right there.

354
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,652
-Hi, Mama.
-There's a sandwich in there for you.

355
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,757
-l'll be in there directly.
-Okay, Mama.

356
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,196
Ma'am.

357
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:04,774
l was wondering if we might carry
your son tomorrow on the team bus.

358
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,374
Got us a football game.

359
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,076
What your boys done to my son
was wrong...

360
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,511
...but l don't expect you
to make up for it.

361
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,652
The boys are taking to him real good.

362
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,653
They're still boys, now, ain't they?

363
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,990
l'll keep a good eye on him.

364
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,427
l guess it's all right with me.

365
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,233
l don't mean to pry, ma'am...

366
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,663
...but l was hoping...

367
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,540
...l might be able to ask you
what exactly is wrong with him.

368
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,941
Well, the doctors never could
give me a name for it.

369
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,312
Say he the same as everybody else,
just a little slower than most.

370
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,818
l got a older boy, Walter.
He's fine and all.

371
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,923
And their daddy?

372
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,765
He died a while back.

373
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:05,962
l'm sorry.

374
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,437
You got your hands full.

375
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:14,172
Well, they got me working 1 0 hours
a day at the hospital. Some days more.

376
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,677
So l'm wondering where he's at
half the time...

377
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,008
...and worrying all the time.

378
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,584
Because l figure they only gonna need
one excuse to put him away.

379
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:31,393
James is a good boy, coach.
He got himself a good heart.

380
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,928
Most folks just don't take the time
to see it, is all.

381
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,527
James.

382
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,529
James Robert Kennedy.

383
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,868
Thank you, ma'am.

384
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,610
<i>No, he is not getting on that bus.</i>

385
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,252
Harold, he is not a student.

386
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,283
You don't even know how old he is.

387
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,323
Look, he has a handicap
we know nothing about.

388
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,961
What if he has some kind
of a seizure?

389
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,461
He's not the one who's
gonna have the seizure.

390
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,691
This has nothing to do
with any of that.

391
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,097
lf you're saying
l'm overly concerned...

392
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,899
...about my students being with
a severely handicapped black man...

393
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,802
...l assure you that l am.

394
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,206
But my concern is not necessarily
for my students.

395
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,210
l'm not so sure we're trying to help
somebody here...

396
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,911
...or whether he's being used as
nothing more than a glorified mascot.

397
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,880
You know me a hell of a lot
better than that.

398
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,566
Put your game face on.

399
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,228
Wipe your smile off your faces.
Start thinking about football.

400
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,139
-Coach Jones. lt raining hard.
-Radio. Radio.

401
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,242
-Gonna be wet out there.
-lt sure is.

402
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,845
Listen, we're not gonna be able
to take you on the bus today.

403
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,713
Some folks, they don't think
it's a good idea.

404
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,623
They just don't understand yet,
but they'll catch on. Believe me.

405
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,556
l'm sorry.

406
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,950
l'm really sorry.

407
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,592
l'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

408
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,246
<i>And in local sports...</i>

409
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,880
<i>...Hanna's Yellow Jackets travel
to Wade Hampton tonight.</i>

410
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,392
<i>With a 4-4 record, they need to win
both their remaining games...</i>

411
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,861
<i>...to keep their playoff hopes alive.</i>

412
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,399
<i>Clock winding down now
in the fourth quarter.</i>

413
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,061
<i>The Yellow Jackets have trailed
all night long...</i>

414
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,539
<i>...but now within striking distance,
trailing 1 4 to 1 3.</i>

415
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,875
<i>Danny Marcum barks out the signals.</i>

416
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,952
<i>He's back to pass.</i>

417
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,415
<i>Incomplete.</i>

418
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,266
<i>Second down now.
Still time to mount one last drive.</i>

419
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,935
<i>And there's the draw play.
Playing up the middle.</i>

420
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,470
<i>To 5, 1 0. First down, Jackets.</i>

421
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,578
<i>Jackets will go for a field goal
to win it.</i>

422
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,711
<i>Less than a minute to play.</i>

423
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,721
<i>-Here's the snap. The kick.
-Kick.</i>

424
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,423
<i>No good!</i>

425
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,257
<i>The Jackets' last-ditch efforts
fall short.</i>

426
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:02,064
<i>Final score: Wade Hampton, 1 4,
Hanna, 1 3.</i>

427
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,344
Here, here. Use a spoon.

428
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,814
There you go.

429
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,321
-l'll get some of these out of your way.
-All right.

430
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,548
Thank you, Grace.

431
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,589
-Which cobbler you got today?
-l got so--

432
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,931
-l'm not done.
-Don't talk with your mouth full, now.

433
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:34,234
-Peach and blackberry.
-Peach and blackberry.

434
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,338
What's it gonna be, Radio?

435
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,496
Both.

436
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,173
Give the man both. l'd like some
more coffee too, please.

437
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,847
Yeah, l take both.

438
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,374
-Radio, look at me.
-l want my pie.

439
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,577
You got mustard on your cheek.
Get it for you.

440
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,278
There you go.

441
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,459
Football season's just about over.

442
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,824
-You know that, don't you?
-One more game.

443
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,865
Yep. One more game.

444
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,798
You gonna be okay with that?

445
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,172
-Where my pie?
-Don't worry, they're coming.

446
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,540
She'll bring you your pie.
Don't worry.

447
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,342
-l like both.
-She's got your order.

448
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,622
Football. l like football.

449
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,860
Some of us felt pretty bad about
leaving you off that bus last night.

450
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,565
We're gonna find a way
to make it up to you.

451
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,993
How you gonna do that, coach?

452
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,306
<i>Your Hanna Yellow Jackets!</i>

453
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,347
Jackets!

454
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,383
All right!

455
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,625
-We're having fun. This is a good one.
-This is a good one.

456
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:11,268
<i>Nothing like archrival Westside
to get Jackets fans stirred up.</i>

457
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,302
<i>Winning this one would even Hanna's
record at 5 and 5...</i>

458
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,871
<i>...and though a far cry
from early season hopes...</i>

459
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,771
<i>...salvage a measure of pride
for the home squad.</i>

460
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,073
Here we go. Here we go.

461
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,944
All right, 4 right,
2 4 flank and reverse.

462
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,019
<i>-Third and 6 on the 40.
-That was a good one, coach.</i>

463
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,349
-We'll see.
-Ready!

464
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,149
That was a reverse! Reverse!

465
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,587
Reverse!

466
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,818
Come back here.

467
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,622
What--?
He's telling the play!

468
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,231
<i>Westside defense calling an audible,
brings in both linebackers.</i>

469
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,061
-Danny, check it off.
-Reverse!

470
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,467
<i>Jones signaling for time, but Marcum
doesn't hear him.</i>

471
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,802
<i>Marcum rolls right, pitches it
to Hill on a flank and reverse.</i>

472
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,309
<i>He is crushed in the backfield
and fumbles the ball.</i>

473
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,449
<i>-It's recovered by Westside!
-Daggum it!</i>

474
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,275
Come on.

475
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,118
No wonder! They knew the play.
They knew the play!

476
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,382
Defense, get out there.

477
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,961
Radio, listen to me. You can't let the
other team know what we're gonna do.

478
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,955
-How they know that, coach?
-Tommy, get out there!

479
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,497
Good God.

480
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,464
Set! Hike!

481
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,037
<i>Snead back to pass for Westside.</i>

482
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,774
<i>It's broken up, but a flag is thrown
on the Jackets' cornerback.</i>

483
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,241
No!

484
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,812
-Got him in the back, coach.
-Are you kidding?!

485
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,473
-You blew that call and you know it.
-You need to move back.

486
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,587
-Don't do it. Don't do it.
-That was a chickenshit call.

487
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,518
-Fifteen more!
-Oh, come on!

488
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,316
<i>Another penalty on Jones.</i>

489
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:46,553
-Chickenshit! Chickenshit!
-Fifteen more. Go to the white line.

490
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,391
Chickenshit! Chickenshit!

491
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,727
-Radio! Get him out of there, Honeycutt!
-Get him back.

492
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,493
Unsportsmanlike conduct!

493
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,265
<i>Just called a third penalty
on the Jackets' bench.</i>

494
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,498
lt looks like a train wreck
down there.

495
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,768
Honeycutt, get him off the field.

496
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,509
How many flags you got?!
You got any more flags?!

497
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,548
<i>-Get him back!
-A total of 45 yards now on the play.</i>

498
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,742
-There goes my evening.
-Come on, Radio.

499
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,081
Let's go, buddy. Here we go.

500
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,520
Any chance l can get the ball?

501
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,461
Nobody speaks in here
unless Coach Jones says he does.

502
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,191
Sit down, Clay.

503
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,730
There your ball.

504
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,409
Now that we got that taken care of....

505
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,651
<i>Jackets trying to hold Westside
in the fourth quarter.</i>

506
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:51,487
<i>They've stiffened here in the second
half and still trail by only 4.</i>

507
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,196
<i>Here comes the Jackets' blitz.</i>

508
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,665
-He got him! He got him!
-He got him!

509
00:43:58,836 --> 00:43:59,825
Go!

510
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,565
<i>The ball will go back to the Jackets
with time for one last drive.</i>

511
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,167
Hut!

512
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,182
<i>Marcum keeps it.
Pitches to Smalls.</i>

513
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,979
<i>Bounces off one tackler
and breaks free. Touchdown, Jackets!</i>

514
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,985
Good job. Come here.

515
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,093
Flanker right, split left. Twenty-four
Z post. Get on your horse, now.

516
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,498
Hey, Honeycutt...

517
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,658
...l got a good feeling about this one.

518
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,962
Good feeling. Good feeling.

519
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,637
Set! Hut!

520
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,610
<i>Marcum fakes the handoff
and drops back to pass.</i>

521
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,501
<i>Looking long.</i>

522
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,306
<i>Mitchell's open.</i>

523
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,775
<i>Touchdown, Yellow Jackets!</i>

524
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,651
-Oh! That was a good one!
-Good one! What'd l tell you?

525
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:59,055
<i>With less than a minute to play, Hanna
has overtaken rival Westside...</i>

526
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,687
<i>...with a stunning 37-yard touchdown.</i>

527
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:12,140
That's the way the game's
supposed to be played. Good job.

528
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,345
Settle down, now. Listen up.

529
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,480
That was a great team effort out there
tonight. Great comeback.

530
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,555
Y'all played your hearts out.
l'm proud of you. Good job.

531
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,351
Honeycutt.

532
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,656
For standing behind us all season long,
especially tonight...

533
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,628
...the game ball...

534
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,691
...goes to Radio.

535
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,016
-Can you sign this?
-Yeah, sure.

536
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,680
-There you go.
-Thanks.

537
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,356
-Hey. How are you?
-Much better now.

538
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,963
Yeah? You want me to bring
this home tonight?

539
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,529
You only got one of them?

540
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,758
-l had a lot to choose from, didn't l?
-No kidding, huh?

541
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,461
-You going over to the shop?
-l suspect so. Shouldn't be too painful.

542
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,099
Well, don't forget to bring some of
that unsportsmanlike conduct home.

543
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,937
All right.

544
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,413
-Evening, fellas.
-Harold.

545
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,418
-lrv. Clive.
-Nice win tonight, coach.

546
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:39,188
-l'll make us a fresh batch.
-Well, this will be fine, Del.

547
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:47,829
Well, l know a .500 season
isn't what we all had in mind...

548
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,132
...but l did see some things tonight
l think we can build on.

549
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,707
The boys made good adjustments
at halftime...

550
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,574
...and Danny Marcum finally got
the offense moving.

551
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,739
-He sure did.
-He sure did, coach.

552
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,682
l'm real proud of all the boys.

553
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,222
Always good to beat Westside,
and it's nice to win the last one.

554
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,693
Wasn't long ago
we were winning most every one.

555
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,623
There something you need
to say, Frank?

556
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,891
Well...

557
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,964
...l think we got too good a team
to be losing half our games.

558
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,003
Anybody else?

559
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,845
lt's all right, you can speak up.

560
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:42,253
Well, if nobody else is gonna
say anything, l sure as hell will.

561
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:47,195
You got yourself a distraction
needs dealing with.

562
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,460
A distraction?

563
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:54,369
That what you think Radio is?

564
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:56,371
Well, you're damn right l do.

565
00:47:56,576 --> 00:47:57,907
Come on, now, Frank.

566
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:06,415
You know, l think l'm gonna
do us all a big favor...

567
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:09,883
...and let you all finish this one
on your own.

568
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,456
Coffee's been better, Del.

569
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,857
Sorry, coach.

570
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:36,406
Well, now you show up.

571
00:48:36,616 --> 00:48:37,810
You chickenshit.

572
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,151
l figured l'd just be in the way.

573
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:43,887
How'd it go?

574
00:48:46,993 --> 00:48:48,927
That good, huh?

575
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,727
l'm afraid we've got
a disgruntled booster on our hands.

576
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:55,933
Banker Frank?

577
00:48:56,703 --> 00:49:02,039
Yeah, he says we got a problem
with Radio being on the sidelines.

578
00:49:07,547 --> 00:49:09,310
What do you think?

579
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:15,821
l think that one's up to you.

580
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:23,519
How's the basketball team looking?

581
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:27,624
Just fine long as Johnny
stays healthy. Why?

582
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:31,702
Oh, l just thought Radio
might need something to do.

583
00:49:36,743 --> 00:49:40,076
-l reckon we could use some help.
-Good.

584
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,770
l'll see you Monday.

585
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:52,791
Hey, what you got now, boy?

586
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,191
Football. Football.

587
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,330
A football? Coach Jones
gave you that?

588
00:49:58,632 --> 00:50:00,031
Yeah.

589
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:04,227
Wait a minute, now.

590
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:06,966
What's the matter?

591
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:13,840
-We all done.
-Oh, now.

592
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:18,416
We all knew the season
was gonna end sometime. Yeah?

593
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:21,752
But look what you got.

594
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:23,820
A football...

595
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:26,948
...and a sweatshirt.

596
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:29,753
And lookie here. Look at all of this.

597
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,188
Look at that.

598
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:34,867
-That Radio.
-Yeah.

599
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,202
See, now, next fall gonna be here
before you know it.

600
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:40,805
Promise.

601
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,402
Now, give Mama a hug.

602
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:48,277
Boy, what's that?

603
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,214
l want me a hug.

604
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,815
l'm always here for you, baby.

605
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,428
<i>President-elect Carter met President
Ford today at the White House.</i>

606
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:07,566
<i>Also meeting with CIA boss
George Bush.</i>

607
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:11,498
<i>The New York Post has been sold to
Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch.</i>

608
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:13,298

-Morning.

00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:37,620
-Hi, Nicole.
-Hi.

612
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:39,158
Coach Jones.

613
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:41,333
-Good morning, Lou.
-Good morning.

614
00:51:41,534 --> 00:51:43,126
What brings you around here?

615
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:47,466
Seeing as you never drop by my office,
l thought l'd pop up for a visit.

616
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:51,007
-And how is everything?
-Everything's fine. Why?

617
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:55,613
A little bird says Mr. Kennedy's spent
time with you inside the building.

618
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,249
Yeah, that's correct.

619
00:51:58,018 --> 00:51:59,747
Do you see that
as a problem?

620
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,580
Disrupting a football game
is one thing.

621
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,519
Disrupting a classroom
is a different matter.

622
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:11,352
l want him with you all the time.
Okay?

623
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:12,826
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:17,132
--l-O.

625
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:19,262
''Radio.''

626
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:21,636
And that's how you spell it.

627
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:24,033
Here, you want to try it?

628
00:52:25,845 --> 00:52:27,210
You want to do it?

629
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:32,142
Look. lt's easy. You just take
the chalk and it writes right on there.

630
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,586
All right, well, we don't
have to do it right now.

631
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,256
Radio.

632
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:46,256
Blueberry and pumpkin today.
Pie, not cobbler.

633
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,962
Both.

634
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:58,778
<i>Coach Jones, you're needed
in the office.</i>

635
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,276
All right, everybody,
just keep working.

636
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:05,310
Radio, keep everybody under control
while l'm gone, now.

637
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,443
Keep an eye on everything.

638
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:14,221
No talking. No talking.

639
00:53:14,427 --> 00:53:16,395
No talking. No--

640
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:18,932
Well, now, how long
would you say Mr. Kennedy...

641
00:53:18,932 --> 00:53:21,560
Well, now, how long
would you say Mr. Kennedy...

642
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:24,259
...has been in
an actual classroom setting?

643
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:27,564
Well, let's see, about a month.

644
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:30,742
And the thinking behind that?

645
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,175
He was doing fine with the team.
l didn't see any harm in it.

646
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:43,312
Mr. Tucker, l know you got a job
to do...

647
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,358
...but is me having Radio in the
classroom really worth all this trouble?

648
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:51,190
That's what the school board
would like to find out.

649
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:55,260
This is a young man who's been
spending his entire lifetime...

650
00:53:55,468 --> 00:53:58,266
...wandering around all by himself
out on the streets.

651
00:53:58,571 --> 00:54:01,938
Which is quite different than being
inside a public school. Right?

652
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:05,070
Yeah, well, that's the point,
isn't it?

653
00:54:05,411 --> 00:54:06,400
Mr. Tucker...

654
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:10,071
...l am well aware of the liability risk
we are running here.

655
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,209
Harold will be first to tell you, my list
of reservations is longer than most.

656
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,910
l'm sure that's the case.

657
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:20,849
But the fact of the matter is,
none of us has any experience...

658
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:25,259
...with having a severely retarded man
wandering the halls with our students.

659
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,391
The risk is enormous.

660
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:29,994
-Please keep that in mind.
-l will.

661
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:33,561
Ms. Daniels.

662
00:54:34,974 --> 00:54:38,273
-Mr. Jones.
-Thank you, Mr. Tucker.

663
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:45,510
Well, this is a hell of a position
you've put me in.

664
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:51,087
Yeah, l suppose it is, Lou.
But Radio's not gonna do anything.

665
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:52,884
Harold.

666
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,526
Why on earth are you doing this?

667
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,827
Same reason you are.

668
00:55:05,238 --> 00:55:08,071
-Defense.
-Defense. Come on.

669
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:12,768
-How you doing?
-l'm good. l'm good.

670
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:17,705
-That's in. That's all right.
-Looks like Radio's doing okay.

671
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,680
Long as there's a ball.

672
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:21,653
How you doing?

673
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:24,248
Hell, Honeycutt, you know me.

674
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,687
Get near Christmas, l start
counting the days till next season.

675
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:29,661
Here you go. Watch this.

676
00:55:31,564 --> 00:55:33,191
Look at him, Honeycutt.

677
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,698
Wasn't long ago you couldn't get
a word out of him.

678
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,695
Yeah, l miss those days sometimes.

679
00:55:39,906 --> 00:55:43,034
l'm going to shoot that one.
l'm going to get that one.

680
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:48,575
Yeah, l got that one. l like that one.
Okay, here we go.

681
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,177
All right, bring it in.

682
00:55:54,787 --> 00:55:56,482
l'll get it.

683
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,690
<i>-Hello?
-Hey, Mrs. Jones.</i>

684
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:01,860

-Hi, Radio.</i>

No, she not here.

00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:23,133
Big Radio in there, Mrs. Jones.

00:58:02,281 --> 00:58:03,771
Great, thanks.

00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:08,676
This is nice. You getting folks
to help Radio out.

723
00:58:09,055 --> 00:58:11,353
No shortage of people
feeling sorry for him.

724
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:15,889
We're not asking people
to feel sorry for him.

725
00:58:16,095 --> 00:58:17,892
That's the last thing he needs.

726
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,205
Look, Mary Helen...

727
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,279
...l know we haven't had much
chance to talk lately.

728
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,947
There's been plenty of chances,
Daddy.

729
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:44,714
You just don't take any of them.

730
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:51,621
lt's all right.

731
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:55,500
Radio needs what you're doing
more than l do.

732
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:58,101
-Look--
-Time to go, Coach Jones.

733
00:58:58,371 --> 00:59:00,999
Time to go. Time to go.

734
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:04,540
-Merry Christmas, Mary Helen.

00:59:42,281 --> 00:59:45,114
-Think we'll fit them all in the house?

746
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:48,212

These are all beautiful.

748
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,360

-lt's a radio.
-Turn it on, see if it works.

01:00:29,595 --> 01:00:30,755

Thank you, coach. Merry Christmas.

01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,373
That's a good one.

771
01:01:20,146 --> 01:01:22,114
Oh, hush now.

772
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:25,949
Lord, we ain't never seen
no Christmas like this.

773
01:01:26,218 --> 01:01:30,416
-You cut a pretty mean rug, coach.
-Oh, come on.

774
01:01:35,895 --> 01:01:37,795
That's where he gets it.

775
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:43,395
Well, he may not get everything l try
to teach him, but he did get that.

776
01:01:45,004 --> 01:01:49,373
The hospital's got me working 1 6
straight, right through Christmas Day.

777
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:52,511
At least tonight l get a little bit
of holiday with my boy.

778
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:54,004
Good.

779
01:01:55,047 --> 01:01:57,572
You know, coach,
it wasn't that long ago...

780
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:01,452
...l see you drive up
in that truck of yours...

781
01:02:01,621 --> 01:02:04,249
...and be wondering
why you doing what you doing.

782
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,428
So why are you doing
what you're doing?

783
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:17,298
l figure it's the right thing to do.

784
01:02:18,504 --> 01:02:22,838
There's a whole lot out there that's
right. Don't mean we always do it.

785
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:25,372
No, ma'am, it doesn't.

786
01:02:31,984 --> 01:02:35,511
James has been telling me next year's
team shaping up as a good one.

787
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:39,316
Well, we're hoping. lf all works out.

788
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,124
You'd let me know
if he was a problem?

789
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:47,164
He's no problem at all, believe me.

790
01:02:51,671 --> 01:02:54,469
<i>How does it feel to be out
from behind bars, Angels?</i>

791
01:03:44,323 --> 01:03:46,257
Good night, darling.

792
01:03:56,302 --> 01:04:00,830
<i>From all of us, to all of you,
a very merry Christmas.</i>

793
01:04:01,073 --> 01:04:06,306
<i>Cloudy and cold today, so stay by that
fire and keep it right here on WAIM.</i>

794
01:04:06,545 --> 01:04:09,639
<i>We'll keep you warm with
your favorite hits commercial-free...</i>

01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:11,715
<i>...all morning long.</i>

01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:44,182
Put that right there.

802
01:04:48,087 --> 01:04:49,679
Hold up.

803
01:04:50,089 --> 01:04:53,456
-That's a pretty decent Christmas--
-No, no, no. That's for me.

804
01:04:53,626 --> 01:04:55,753
-What's your name, son?
-Radio.

805
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:59,294
Radio, huh?
Hey. Keep it here.

-You see how much they paying Dr. J.?
-How much?

814
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:43,102
You're making this harder
than it has to be, son.

815
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:46,102
Can't be for one season.

816
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:50,146
Ain't nobody makes a half a million
dollars for playing basketball one year.

817
01:05:50,449 --> 01:05:54,408
-Who you got back there, Kojak?
-l'm not sure. Won't tell me his name.

He ain't been here a week,

819
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,617
Let's go see who it is.

820
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,858
When was the last time we had

822

854
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:17,453
Miss Winniver will let me in 1 1 th grade,
right?

855
01:08:17,629 --> 01:08:18,857
That's right.

856
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:25,125
You remember we talked about you
staying close to the teachers.

857
01:08:25,337 --> 01:08:28,101
Don't want you wandering off
on your own.

858
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:32,206
That was a good thing you did today.

859
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,175
That was a good thing you did today
with the presents.

860
01:08:36,382 --> 01:08:38,782
You didn't do anything wrong.
You understand?

861
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:40,781
Radio did nothing wrong.

862
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:42,978

863
01:08:43,155 --> 01:08:45,715

01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:11,043
No running. Stop! No running.

Jump, Jackets, jump! Jump way up!

You gotta keep Radio on the bench.

01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:44,307
Stay on the bench. Stay on the bench.

883
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,915

<i>Clay working off the pick.
Drives right side.</i>

<i>-No basket! No!
-Offensive foul, Johnny Clay.</i>

888
01:10:03,068 --> 01:10:06,663
-1 5 out of control.
-You're killing me. Time-out! Time-out!

889
01:10:06,839 --> 01:10:09,330
Ref! Did you think about that?!

890
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:10,565

There it is.

895
01:10:23,122 --> 01:10:25,852
-Who'd you catch running in the hall?
-Billy Samson.

896
01:10:26,024 --> 01:10:29,960
Swear, you have turned out
to be quite the hall monitor.

897
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:33,462
Morning, Hanna.

898
01:10:33,665 --> 01:10:37,294
<i>You know who this is? This is Radio.</i>

899
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:40,964
Today our menu is Salisbury steak.

900
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:43,607

903
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,938

-Hey, we'll see you later.
-Yeah.

909
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,409
Hey, yo.

910
01:11:20,012 --> 01:11:21,001
Radio.

911
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:23,474
-Hey, how you doing?
-What's going on?

912
01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:25,343
Hey, where's Honeycutt at, man?

913
01:11:25,684 --> 01:11:27,549
-Coach Honeycutt, he around?
-He gone.

914
01:11:27,753 --> 01:11:29,653
-He's gone. All right.
-Yeah, he gone.

915
01:11:29,855 --> 01:11:34,292
Coach Dalrymple's got a couple things
next door she wants you to come get.

916
01:11:34,826 --> 01:11:35,815
Mrs. Dalrymple.

917
01:11:36,328 --> 01:11:39,559
Don't worry, it's just her.
She's alone. Girls are gone.

918
01:11:40,165 --> 01:11:42,030
l can't do that.

919
01:11:42,267 --> 01:11:45,759
All right, man. All right,
but she's gonna be real disappointed.

920
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:48,304
You don't want to let her down, do you?

921
01:11:50,242 --> 01:11:52,210
-Okay, Radio.
-See you.

922
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,107
Mrs. Dalrymple?

923
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,104
Mrs. Dalrymple?

924
01:12:33,352 --> 01:12:34,614
Radio!

925
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,583
You can't be in here.

926
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:46,293
Bad Radio. Bad Radio.

927
01:12:47,599 --> 01:12:49,658
Coach Jones. Coach Jones.

928
01:12:49,868 --> 01:12:53,326
Coach Jones. No, Radio.
No, Radio. No.

929
01:12:55,841 --> 01:13:00,210
lt'd be one thing if you had done
something like this before on your own.

930
01:13:03,915 --> 01:13:05,780
Radio, listen to me.

931
01:13:06,685 --> 01:13:10,621
lt's important that you tell me why
you went in the girls' locker room.

932
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:13,824
-Mrs. Dalrymple needed me.
-What for?

933
01:13:16,995 --> 01:13:20,055
-She wanted me to pick up stuff.
-Did she ask you?

934
01:13:20,799 --> 01:13:22,528
Did she ask you?

935
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:25,864
-No.
-Who did?

936
01:13:26,838 --> 01:13:27,964
No.

937
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:32,275
Radio, who asked you to go
in the girls' locker room?

938
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:35,607
Who asked you?

939
01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:39,914
No.

940
01:13:45,624 --> 01:13:47,956
l don't know what l'm supposed
to do here.

941
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,787
Be mad at Radio.

942
01:13:50,462 --> 01:13:52,225
Be mad at Radio.

943
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,074
You're willing to do that?

944
01:14:04,242 --> 01:14:06,437
Take the blame for someone else?

945
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:16,984
You're a better man than me.
l'll say that for you.

946
01:14:32,371 --> 01:14:33,531
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

947
01:14:33,739 --> 01:14:36,037
l got a letter last week from Clemson.

948
01:14:36,241 --> 01:14:39,574
They're looking at me for a full ride
after next year.

949
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:42,179
-That's great.
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

950
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:45,009
Excuse me. l need to speak
with Mr. Clay.

951
01:14:45,183 --> 01:14:47,174
-See you, Johnny.
-What's up, coach?

952
01:14:47,352 --> 01:14:51,049
lt's one of those days l wish l wasn't
a teacher so l could lay into you.

953
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:53,448
What you talking about?

954
01:14:54,426 --> 01:14:55,757
What's gotten into you?

955
01:14:55,927 --> 01:14:59,294
l thought you'd learned something
the past few months. l was wrong.

956
01:14:59,464 --> 01:15:02,991
-What are you talking about?
-Don't speak unless l tell you to.

957
01:15:06,037 --> 01:15:10,531
You might think you're clear because
Honeycutt was gone, but this is my call.

958
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:15,671
There's no way you're suiting up
tomorrow night.

959
01:15:16,982 --> 01:15:18,176
Right.

960
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:22,750
-What did you say?
-Coach Jones. Mr. Clay.

961
01:15:22,988 --> 01:15:25,855
-What seems to be the problem?
-You hear the problem.

962
01:15:26,425 --> 01:15:30,293
Young man, students do not tell me
what l do and do not hear.

963
01:15:31,129 --> 01:15:32,653
He said l can't play tomorrow.

964
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:37,567
-ls that what you're thinking, coach?
-That's what l'm saying.

965
01:15:37,936 --> 01:15:41,372
Well, then, seeing that Coach Jones
is the athletic director...

966
01:15:41,573 --> 01:15:43,336
...l say you are not playing.

967
01:15:43,508 --> 01:15:46,875
Ma'am, this is Westside.
lf we win, we're in first place.

968
01:15:47,345 --> 01:15:50,974
That's all the more reason for you
to cheer on your teammates, isn't it?

969
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:52,844
Anything else?

970
01:15:55,954 --> 01:15:58,286
Yeah, tell your boy that l said thanks.

971
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:00,720
Radio didn't sell you out, son.

972
01:16:01,259 --> 01:16:03,955
There are plenty of other people
willing to do that.

973
01:16:11,736 --> 01:16:13,328
Yes, sir.

974
01:16:14,272 --> 01:16:16,570
Well, l appreciate
your understanding.

975
01:16:17,342 --> 01:16:19,833
We'll talk soon. Thank you.

976
01:16:24,115 --> 01:16:25,946
That's the last of them.

977
01:16:26,518 --> 01:16:27,883
You talk to Mary Helen yet?

978
01:16:28,086 --> 01:16:30,919
Yeah, she's fine. She knows
it wasn't Radio's idea.

979
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:32,555
Oh, Harold.

980
01:16:32,757 --> 01:16:35,749
Harold, you are too close
to this.

981
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:39,724
lt's not that Johnny talked Radio into
doing it, it's that he did it.

982
01:16:39,931 --> 01:16:42,559
What if it's something worse
next time?

983
01:16:43,768 --> 01:16:46,601
-He'll know.
-Are you sure?

984
01:16:47,572 --> 01:16:49,972
Hell, l'm already
under a microscope anyway.

985
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:53,144
l got a school to run, a thousand kids
l'm responsible for.

986
01:16:53,311 --> 01:16:55,575
l need to know
where all this is going.

987
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,714
l don't know, Lou.

988
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,945
That may not be
good enough anymore.

989
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:14,192
l'm sorry. l've been trying to call, and
l haven't gotten ahold of either of them.

990
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:16,526
l tried several different places.

991
01:17:16,735 --> 01:17:19,226
Here he comes right now.
l'll tell him.

992
01:17:21,206 --> 01:17:24,198
-What's the matter?
-lt's Radio's mama, Daddy.

993
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:26,502
-What happened?
-She had a heart attack.

994
01:17:26,711 --> 01:17:28,611
Oh, no. ls she all right?

995
01:17:29,548 --> 01:17:30,879
No, she's gone.

996
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:35,783
l was trying to call you or Mom,
but l couldn't reach anybody.

997
01:17:35,987 --> 01:17:40,390
And they're telling me
that he won't come out of his room.

998
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,350
l don't know what to do, Daddy.

999
01:17:42,561 --> 01:17:44,461
All right. Put your coat on.

1000
01:17:44,663 --> 01:17:47,427
He's just sitting there in his room.

1001
01:17:47,832 --> 01:17:49,060
You got it?

1002
01:18:03,148 --> 01:18:04,137
lrv.

1003
01:18:04,349 --> 01:18:06,442
Coach, thanks for coming.

1004
01:18:06,851 --> 01:18:08,785
Walter will be here in a few minutes.

1005
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:12,456
-How's Radio?
-He's pretty upset.

1006
01:18:12,724 --> 01:18:14,919
Tore the place up pretty good too.

1007
01:18:26,538 --> 01:18:27,937
Radio?

1008
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:14,582
lt's just me. lt's Coach Jones.

1009
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,497
lt's just coach.

1010
01:19:26,731 --> 01:19:28,198
Coach.

1011
01:19:29,968 --> 01:19:32,630
Coach. That's Radio.

1012
01:19:32,804 --> 01:19:33,896
Yeah.

1013
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,170
-That's you.
-Radio right there.

1014
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:53,148
There's Mama there. Mama said
we got good football this year.

1015
01:19:53,324 --> 01:19:54,313
Yes. Yeah.

1016
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:56,892
That's what Mama said.
We got good--

1017
01:20:08,406 --> 01:20:11,842
Radio, ain't nothing l can say is
gonna make you feel any better.

1018
01:20:13,478 --> 01:20:14,945
Mama.

1019
01:20:15,146 --> 01:20:17,706
Your mama was a fine,
beautiful woman.

1020
01:20:17,982 --> 01:20:20,678
She loved you with all her heart,
didn't she?

1021
01:20:20,852 --> 01:20:23,252
Oh, boy, did she love you.

1022
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:28,415
-She still does.
-She love the Radio.

1023
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:35,227
She said she's always gonna
be there for Radio.

1024
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:41,168
James...

1025
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:44,464
...look at me.

1026
01:20:45,443 --> 01:20:46,774
Look at me.

1027
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:51,006
She will always be there for you.
All right? She will.

1028
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,411
You understand that?

1029
01:20:53,852 --> 01:20:57,583
Always be with you inside,
right in your heart. All right?

1030
01:21:08,299 --> 01:21:10,028
We're gonna be all right.

1031
01:21:11,903 --> 01:21:14,133
All right, boy. Come here. Come here.

1032
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:17,933
Where's my mama?

1033
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:31,984
Hold on just a second.

1034
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:38,258
l want to tell you something.

1035
01:21:41,032 --> 01:21:43,296
Something l never told anybody.

1036
01:21:45,837 --> 01:21:49,136
When l was about 1 2,
l had a paper route.

1037
01:21:51,276 --> 01:21:53,335
Crack of dawn every day.

1038
01:21:55,513 --> 01:21:58,573
Wasn't many houses
around here then...

1039
01:21:58,783 --> 01:22:01,547
...so l had to cover quite a lot
of territory...

1040
01:22:01,753 --> 01:22:06,781
...and l used to cut through
the woods on this little dirt road.

1041
01:22:07,158 --> 01:22:11,288
And one morning, l was riding
through there...

1042
01:22:11,496 --> 01:22:14,158
...and l heard this noise.

1043
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:20,735
Sounded like a rabbit or something,
you know, caught in a trap.

1044
01:22:21,673 --> 01:22:25,666
And then l realized it was coming from
one of the houses set back in there.

1045
01:22:27,846 --> 01:22:29,575
l kind of walked over there...

1046
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:33,444
...and didn't seem like anybody
was home, so l walked on up.

1047
01:22:33,651 --> 01:22:38,816
lt had, you know, chicken wire and
barbed wire around the bottom of it.

1048
01:22:39,023 --> 01:22:41,548
l figure to keep the critters out,
you know?

1049
01:22:44,495 --> 01:22:49,194
And then all of the sudden, l saw
these fingers coming through the wire.

1050
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:53,065
And l put my bike down...

1051
01:22:53,872 --> 01:22:56,466
...and got down
on my hands and knees...

1052
01:22:57,208 --> 01:23:02,145
...and l looked under there,
and there was this boy about my age.

1053
01:23:03,014 --> 01:23:06,506
l don't know what was wrong
with him. Something was.

1054
01:23:07,385 --> 01:23:09,410
They used to keep him under there.

1055
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:13,757
And l looked right at him.

1056
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:17,152
He looked back at me.

1057
01:23:20,398 --> 01:23:23,458
We just sat there staring
at each other for a while.

1058
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,071
l ran that route for two years,
Mary Helen.

1059
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,977
And l never did a thing.

1060
01:23:53,498 --> 01:23:55,625
l just wanted you to know that.

1061
01:23:57,835 --> 01:23:59,427
Thanks, Daddy.

1062
01:24:24,462 --> 01:24:27,124
-How long before he comes back?
-l'm hoping tomorrow.

1063
01:24:27,298 --> 01:24:29,562
His brother Walter's moved in
with him.

1064
01:24:29,767 --> 01:24:32,827
Honeycutt says he let loose
on that house pretty good.

1065
01:24:33,404 --> 01:24:36,100
Says he's not the only one
that knows about it either.

1066
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:38,275
The man had just lost his
mother, Lou.

1067
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:42,810
l didn't ask why he took a swing at his
wall. l asked you if you knew about it.

1068
01:24:43,047 --> 01:24:44,981
Why are you asking me that?

1069
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:52,321
Our friend from the board is back.
He wants to see you.

1070
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:57,155
With his mama gone, it's all different.
Every bit of it.

1071
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:01,491
Good luck.

1072
01:25:03,735 --> 01:25:08,695
ln the last month, how much time
has Mr. Kennedy spent alone?

1073
01:25:09,874 --> 01:25:11,705
During the day at least.

1074
01:25:14,045 --> 01:25:15,410
Mr. Jones.

1075
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,982
Past few weeks? Everybody's been
keeping a pretty steady eye on him.

1076
01:25:21,252 --> 01:25:23,413
So we talking an hour a day?
Or two?

1077
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:26,613
An hour, maybe.
Well, it could be a half-hour.

1078
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,391
Well, as you may have guessed...

1079
01:25:31,562 --> 01:25:35,259
...the board has received reports of
Mr. Kennedy's inconsistent behavior.

1080
01:25:35,466 --> 01:25:37,331
What kind of reports? From who?

1081
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:39,662
Reports of resisting arrest...

1082
01:25:40,505 --> 01:25:43,531
...tearing up his home,
barging into the girls' locker room.

1083
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:45,039
Oh, barging?

1084
01:25:45,376 --> 01:25:49,972
-Who's been feeding you this crap?
-l'm not here to argue with you.

1085
01:25:50,148 --> 01:25:54,016
l'm not arguing. lt's a simple question.
Who's been feeding you this crap?

1086
01:25:55,586 --> 01:26:00,819
l ask because those were all instances
in which he wasn't being supervised.

1087
01:26:00,992 --> 01:26:01,981
Says who?

1088
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:05,726
Says who?

1089
01:26:06,631 --> 01:26:11,967
Bottom line, with Ms. Kennedy gone,
James faces some rough times ahead.

1090
01:26:12,236 --> 01:26:15,467
-To keep him in a school setting--
-Let me tell you something.

1091
01:26:15,673 --> 01:26:18,506
This school is the reason he's doing
as well as he is.

1092
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:21,545
But to keep him in a school setting--

1093
01:26:21,746 --> 01:26:24,977
You take him out of this school,
you may as well take his life.

1094
01:26:26,918 --> 01:26:30,945
-l've compiled a list of care agencies.
-Oh, l'll bet you have.

1095
01:26:54,412 --> 01:26:57,381
Yes, ma'am, l will take care of it
personally.

1096
01:26:57,582 --> 01:26:59,049
Yes, l will.

1097
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,573
Yes, ma'am.

1098
01:27:04,155 --> 01:27:05,520
Yes, ma'am.

1099
01:27:06,124 --> 01:27:07,648
ls that a fact?

1100
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,428
That's some serious money.

1101
01:27:11,696 --> 01:27:14,221
Well, all right. Yes, l will.

1102
01:27:14,732 --> 01:27:16,199
All right, now, you too.

1103
01:27:18,669 --> 01:27:20,466
-Harold.
-Hello, Frank.

1104
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:24,630
-lt's been ages since you were here.
-Yeah, it sure has been.

1105
01:27:30,781 --> 01:27:31,907
So...

1106
01:27:33,417 --> 01:27:36,113
-...what can l do for you?
-What are you trying to do?

1107
01:27:36,554 --> 01:27:38,385
l'm afraid l don't understand.

1108
01:27:38,589 --> 01:27:42,719
Yeah, you do. Calling the school board,
making complaints about Radio.

1109
01:27:43,427 --> 01:27:46,624
This is you getting back at me
for cracking down on your boy.

1110
01:27:46,831 --> 01:27:49,800
Now, let's not go off making this
all personal.

1111
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:52,993
-lt is personal.
-lt's not. Besides which, if it was...

1112
01:27:53,204 --> 01:27:56,571
...most of the guys at Del and Don's
wouldn't feel the way l do.

1113
01:27:57,542 --> 01:27:59,066
Yeah, what way is that?

1114
01:28:01,112 --> 01:28:03,808
You're one of the finest coaches
in the upstate.

1115
01:28:04,015 --> 01:28:07,382
And with Johnny and the boys
we got coming back next year...

1116
01:28:08,786 --> 01:28:12,722
...it's just better if we do things
the way we used to.

1117
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:17,818
You just want to be the one
runs Radio out of Hanna.

1118
01:28:23,534 --> 01:28:25,900
At least l know where you stand.

1119
01:28:28,539 --> 01:28:30,632
Radio. That's the O.

1120
01:28:30,841 --> 01:28:34,140
Big, round circle.
Yeah, you try it now.

1121
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:38,141
Come on, it's all right. lt's okay.

1122
01:28:38,482 --> 01:28:40,382
There you go, take the pencil.

1123
01:28:42,286 --> 01:28:44,481
You can do it, l know you can.

1124
01:28:46,224 --> 01:28:47,248
That's it.

1125
01:29:00,004 --> 01:29:00,993
There.

1126
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:04,766
Look at that. You did it.

1127
01:29:05,509 --> 01:29:08,603
Congratulations. Good job.

1128
01:29:08,846 --> 01:29:11,815
Radio right there. Radio right there.

1129
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:22,415
-Hey, look who's back.
-What's up, Jimmy?

1130
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:26,854
Johnny, welcome back, man.

1131
01:29:28,132 --> 01:29:29,292
What's this?

1132
01:29:29,533 --> 01:29:31,865
He brought that in a little while ago.

1133
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:06,764
Sorry Coach Jones got mad at you.

1134
01:30:06,971 --> 01:30:08,939
He got real mad.

1135
01:30:13,344 --> 01:30:14,811
Yeah, he did.

1136
01:30:15,212 --> 01:30:18,045
Yeah. Real mad.

1137
01:30:29,327 --> 01:30:32,262
<i>Jackets playing tough D.
And there's a steal by Walker!</i>

1138
01:30:32,997 --> 01:30:36,160
<i>Honeycutt calling the play
as the Jackets walk it up the floor.</i>

1139
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,526
Two!

1140
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:42,532
<i>Jackson has it in the corner.
Finds Clay, who drives foul line!</i>

1141
01:30:42,707 --> 01:30:46,074
<i>Great pass to Cunningham.
Underneath for an easy 2.</i>

1142
01:30:47,378 --> 01:30:48,743
All right!

1143
01:30:49,113 --> 01:30:51,638
<i>Johnny Clay, doing it all tonight.</i>

1144
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:54,283
Down the floor, up the score!
We want 2!

1145
01:30:54,952 --> 01:30:56,112
<i>Now Clay from deep.</i>

1146
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:02,589
<i>Good!</i>

1147
01:31:09,567 --> 01:31:12,263
<i>Johnny Clay has 1 7 points.</i>

1148
01:31:12,636 --> 01:31:17,938
<i>And that's the end of the first half
with the score: Hanna, 39, Easley, 34.</i>

1149
01:31:18,809 --> 01:31:22,870
That's a good first half, boys.
That's a good first half.

1150
01:31:24,582 --> 01:31:27,380
You gonna stick around?
Save my seat.

1151
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:30,145
-All right, bring me a drink, will you?
-Yep.

1152
01:31:32,723 --> 01:31:35,191
l talked to Mr. Tucker
and his colleagues...

1153
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:39,420
...and we all agreed that we should
get together and have a meeting.

1154
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:41,724
Well, l don't want to talk about him.

1155
01:31:43,934 --> 01:31:45,128
Harold.

1156
01:31:47,138 --> 01:31:48,605
l know what you're thinking.

1157
01:31:48,773 --> 01:31:52,675
-l thought we were together on this.
-l must find the best possible solution.

1158
01:31:52,843 --> 01:31:55,573
-lt's not about who--
-What is it about?

1159
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:02,018
You remember asking me
where all this was going?

1160
01:32:03,154 --> 01:32:04,382
Do you?

1161
01:32:05,856 --> 01:32:07,323
l still don't know.

1162
01:32:07,525 --> 01:32:12,428
But l do know this. l won't sit back and
let Frank Clay make the rules on this.

1163
01:32:18,068 --> 01:32:20,195
<i>Clay saves it off the tip.</i>

1164
01:32:20,738 --> 01:32:22,330
<i>Underneath to Henry.</i>

1165
01:32:22,506 --> 01:32:25,669
<i>Great teamwork! And the Jackets
go up by 7.</i>

1166
01:32:27,878 --> 01:32:31,177
<i>Clay off the screen. Jumper!
Good!</i>

1167
01:32:36,554 --> 01:32:38,886
<i>Johnny Clay in the zone now.</i>

1168
01:32:39,623 --> 01:32:43,582
<i>Easley working the ball upcourt.
And Clay with the steal.</i>

1169
01:32:43,961 --> 01:32:47,727
<i>Great pass by Clay to Greer
for the easy 2.</i>

1170
01:32:47,965 --> 01:32:51,526
<i>And the Jackets are running away
with this one.</i>

1171
01:32:56,574 --> 01:32:59,407
Feels good, don't it? Feels real good.

1172
01:32:59,643 --> 01:33:02,009
Settle down, settle down, settle down.

1173
01:33:02,246 --> 01:33:05,238
Now, l've coached a lot of basketball
over the years.

1174
01:33:05,449 --> 01:33:08,680
But l've never had a team play better
than you all did tonight.

1175
01:33:11,956 --> 01:33:14,550
Johnny Clay, it's nice having you back.

1176
01:33:14,725 --> 01:33:16,488
-Yeah, it is.
-lt's good to be back.

1177
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:17,922
Good. Good.

1178
01:33:18,128 --> 01:33:21,825
We're still in this race, so rest up
tomorrow. We'll hit it hard Monday.

1179
01:33:22,032 --> 01:33:23,966
All right? Get some sleep.

1180
01:33:26,136 --> 01:33:28,263
-Play him, you got a shot.
-Believe it.

1181
01:33:28,472 --> 01:33:30,906
-There's my boy.
-Always a pleasure to see you.

1182
01:33:31,208 --> 01:33:33,176
-Good game, son.
-Thirty-two.

1183
01:33:33,344 --> 01:33:34,777
What's with all the passing?

1184
01:33:34,979 --> 01:33:38,312
With the defense they were playing,
you could have gone for 50.

1185
01:33:38,716 --> 01:33:41,446
You gotta take advantage
of these chances, son.

1186
01:33:41,619 --> 01:33:43,211
-Bye, everybody.
-See you, Radio.

1187
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,354
Bye, Johnny. Bye, now.
See you later.

1188
01:33:45,556 --> 01:33:47,023
What's that?

1189
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,088
lt's nothing.

1190
01:33:51,795 --> 01:33:56,129
Look, son, we got a whole lot
to look forward to next year.

1191
01:33:56,367 --> 01:34:00,463
And l don't want anything or anyone
getting in the way. You understand?

1192
01:34:02,106 --> 01:34:04,870
Radio's not the one getting
in the way, Dad.

1193
01:34:12,116 --> 01:34:16,951
That Frank, he's just scared
you got it in for his son, is all.

1194
01:34:17,254 --> 01:34:19,586
<i>When Gloria was a baby,
I never left her alone.</i>

1195
01:34:19,757 --> 01:34:22,317
<i>Wherever I went, I made sure
Edith stayed with her.</i>

1196
01:34:24,595 --> 01:34:26,995
l forgot to tell you Honeycutt called.

1197
01:34:27,231 --> 01:34:31,793
Yeah, some of the parents asked for
a meeting with Lou on Sunday night.

1198
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:34,231
Just Lou?

1199
01:34:34,438 --> 01:34:38,431
Yeah, l don't think they're interested
in your side of things, do you?

1200
01:34:39,009 --> 01:34:40,567
No, l guess not.

1201
01:34:43,781 --> 01:34:45,976
<i>What the hell kind of a father--?</i>

1202
01:34:46,183 --> 01:34:48,674
<i>What the hell kind of a father
are you?</i>

1203
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:52,812
Hell. Maybe the whole thing's
just a big mistake.

1204
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:56,426
Radio would've been better off
if we'd just gotten him some help.

1205
01:34:56,794 --> 01:35:00,423
Help? And what you've been
giving him has been...?

1206
01:35:00,898 --> 01:35:03,298
Couldn't have been easy
on you and Mary Helen...

1207
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,128
...me spending all this time
with Radio.

1208
01:35:06,337 --> 01:35:08,066
Harold, wait.

1209
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:11,901
You can't believe that's been
a mistake, you being with Radio.

1210
01:35:13,844 --> 01:35:17,871
-You've been so great for each other.
-Yeah, well, look where it's got us.

1211
01:35:18,082 --> 01:35:21,483
Where it got you is a school
full of kids that love him.

1212
01:35:21,685 --> 01:35:23,482
And Mary Helen feels the same way.

1213
01:35:23,654 --> 01:35:27,681
And anything that Frank can do or say
won't change anything.

1214
01:35:29,593 --> 01:35:32,289
lt's never a mistake to care
for someone.

1215
01:35:32,496 --> 01:35:34,691
That's always a good thing.

1216
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,526
Right?

1217
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,070
-Thank you, Reverend.
-God bless you.

1218
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:46,539
God bless you.
That was quite a sermon.

1219
01:35:46,744 --> 01:35:48,678
lndeed. Praise the Lord.

1220
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:52,074
-God bless you, Radio.
-Praise the Lord.

1221
01:35:52,249 --> 01:35:53,477
-Coach.
-Praise the Lord.

1222
01:35:53,684 --> 01:35:55,311
l love that sermon.
l like that.

1223
01:35:55,486 --> 01:35:57,010
<i>All hands are Jesus' hands</i>

1224
01:35:57,187 --> 01:36:00,486
l like that.
l like the way everybody singing.

1225
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:03,683
Yeah, that was a nice service.
A nice service.

1226
01:36:03,894 --> 01:36:06,886
l need to talk to you
about a little something here.

1227
01:36:07,998 --> 01:36:11,525
You remember telling me
about being in 1 1 th grade?

1228
01:36:11,735 --> 01:36:15,034
You talking about Mrs. Winniver.
Yeah, l like Mrs. Winniver.

1229
01:36:15,205 --> 01:36:19,164
There's been some talk about
maybe you going on to 1 2th grade.

1230
01:36:19,343 --> 01:36:22,972
That'd be something, wouldn't it?
You know, have you graduate.

1231
01:36:24,581 --> 01:36:26,071
Radio, listen to me.

1232
01:36:26,283 --> 01:36:28,114
Put your-- Take your radio d--

1233
01:36:28,318 --> 01:36:31,719
Radio, put your radio down.
Look at me. Look at me.

1234
01:36:31,889 --> 01:36:35,848
There's nothing wrong with moving on.
Everybody gets to it eventually.

1235
01:36:36,226 --> 01:36:41,061
No. No, l like the 1 1 th grade.
l like the 1 1 th grade.

1236
01:36:41,265 --> 01:36:42,459
No. No.

1237
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:45,225
l do the menu in the morning.

1238
01:36:45,436 --> 01:36:48,735
l say, ''We're gonna have
hamburgers and mashed potatoes.''

1239
01:36:48,939 --> 01:36:52,204
And then l see people in the hallway,
l say, ''Hey. No running.

1240
01:36:52,409 --> 01:36:55,572
Everybody, no running.'' Everybody
know that's Radio. l'm there.

1241
01:36:55,746 --> 01:36:58,806
Everybody like that.
They say, ''Hi, Radio!''

1242
01:36:59,016 --> 01:37:02,782
All right, listen. We'll talk about it
when we get closer to the fall.

1243
01:37:02,986 --> 01:37:05,546
Let's not worry about it right now.

1244
01:37:05,756 --> 01:37:08,486
Radio like the fall.
That's when football come.

1245
01:37:08,726 --> 01:37:12,059
lt's football. We'll exercise,
and everybody have T-shirts on.

1246
01:37:12,262 --> 01:37:16,164
And Coach Honeycutt, he be,
''Let's see some Hanna spirit!''

1247
01:37:16,366 --> 01:37:19,164
Yeah. Hey, coach, you say,
''Let's get the quarterback.''

1248
01:37:19,403 --> 01:37:22,964
And Radio, he defense coach.
l'll be defense coach.

1249
01:37:23,173 --> 01:37:25,403
That's right. We'll go all the way.

1250
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:28,976
-That's right, Radio.
-We gonna go all of the way.

1251
01:37:29,179 --> 01:37:31,807
Because we got the spirit.

1252
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:43,783
We gonna go all the way.
We gonna go all the way.

1253
01:37:45,529 --> 01:37:49,158
This man is a disruptive force
in our community...

1254
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:51,995
...and represents a threat
to our students.

1255
01:37:52,836 --> 01:37:53,996
Thank you, Mr. Clay.

1256
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:58,540
Okay, Okay. l understand how
some of you might be feeling.

1257
01:37:58,776 --> 01:38:03,543
All l am asking is that if we decide
that there's no other way around this...

1258
01:38:03,747 --> 01:38:06,307
...that we dole out as little hurt
as possible.

1259
01:38:06,483 --> 01:38:09,509
Fine. Honeycutt, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1260
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:18,060
-Evening, Del. Don.
-Harold.

1261
01:38:18,262 --> 01:38:20,594
-Evening, everyone.
-Evening.

1262
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:24,865
Hi, Lou.

1263
01:38:25,602 --> 01:38:27,536
-How you doing?
-l'm good. l'm good.

1264
01:38:27,738 --> 01:38:29,763
-How are you?
-Good.

1265
01:38:30,474 --> 01:38:32,533
l was gonna call you.

1266
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:37,238
-You got a crowded shop tonight, Del.
-Yeah, coach.

1267
01:38:37,447 --> 01:38:41,247
l think y'all know my wife, Linda,
and my daughter, Mary Helen.

1268
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,482
-Evening.
-Evening, ma'am.

1269
01:38:45,823 --> 01:38:49,190
Well, l had a talk with Radio
this morning.

1270
01:38:50,093 --> 01:38:54,996
l told him, in not so many words, that
we might be looking at some changes.

1271
01:38:55,899 --> 01:38:58,231
lt didn't take long to see
the more l talked...

1272
01:38:58,402 --> 01:39:00,427
...the more he didn't understand me.

1273
01:39:01,505 --> 01:39:03,769
We got a lot of that going on around.

1274
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,841
When l was playing, l had a coach...

1275
01:39:12,182 --> 01:39:14,946
...he used to tell me to keep
my priorities straight.

1276
01:39:15,786 --> 01:39:18,186
He'd say, ''Son, you figure out what's
important.

1277
01:39:18,355 --> 01:39:20,721
You push everything else aside.''

1278
01:39:25,329 --> 01:39:27,024
l love football.

1279
01:39:28,999 --> 01:39:30,728
l love everything about it.

1280
01:39:32,469 --> 01:39:34,801
l love Friday nights when
you look for a win...

1281
01:39:34,972 --> 01:39:37,600
...and Saturday morning
when you found one.

1282
01:39:42,212 --> 01:39:45,477
But that's not what's important
right now.

1283
01:39:47,618 --> 01:39:50,985
We got ourselves a young man
we're not thinking about.

1284
01:39:53,023 --> 01:39:56,390
The same young man who could
hardly talk when we first met him...

1285
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,495
...and now he's making
announcements over the loudspeaker.

1286
01:40:01,832 --> 01:40:04,926
Same young man who got himself
a football letter last fall...

1287
01:40:05,102 --> 01:40:08,128
...but never wears it, because
he can't afford a jacket.

1288
01:40:11,408 --> 01:40:13,273
Now we're asking him to leave.

1289
01:40:13,477 --> 01:40:16,503
-Harold, we are not asking--
-The man's not done, Frank.

1290
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:23,384
l know some of you don't know
or don't care...

1291
01:40:23,587 --> 01:40:27,182
...about all that Radio's learned
over these past few months.

1292
01:40:29,326 --> 01:40:30,725
Well, the truth is...

1293
01:40:31,528 --> 01:40:34,156
...we're not the ones
who've been teaching Radio.

1294
01:40:36,233 --> 01:40:38,497
Radio's the one been teaching us.

1295
01:40:41,805 --> 01:40:43,670
The way he treats us all the time...

1296
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,276
...is the way we wish we treated
each other even part of the time.

1297
01:40:50,981 --> 01:40:55,577
l know something's gotta happen here.
l know some changes gotta be made.

1298
01:40:57,621 --> 01:41:02,058
And l know l can't let what happened
last season happen again.

1299
01:41:06,129 --> 01:41:08,893
So l've decided to step down
as head football coach.

1300
01:41:20,744 --> 01:41:22,678
See what you've done, Frank.

1301
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,511
l'd like to keep teaching,
if that's all right.

1302
01:41:30,187 --> 01:41:33,748
l'll keep an eye on Radio,
make sure he stays out of trouble.

1303
01:41:34,524 --> 01:41:36,253
And l'd like to spend more time...

1304
01:41:36,426 --> 01:41:39,418
...with a few other folks
l've neglected over the years...

1305
01:41:39,763 --> 01:41:41,731
...while l still have a chance to.

1306
01:41:45,769 --> 01:41:50,934
Much as l love this game, it's not
half as important as setting that right.

1307
01:41:55,345 --> 01:41:57,074
That was a pretty good cup, Del.

1308
01:41:59,516 --> 01:42:01,416
-Thank y'all.
-Good night.

1309
01:42:08,525 --> 01:42:10,254
This what you wanted?

1310
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,927
ls this worth it?

1311
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:19,130
-That was a crazy idea.
-Weren't expecting that, were you?

1312
01:42:19,369 --> 01:42:22,668
l can't believe you're gonna stop
coaching football.

1313
01:42:29,713 --> 01:42:33,979
Found it. Under the mattress
with everything else.

1314
01:42:34,551 --> 01:42:35,882
All right.

1315
01:42:37,054 --> 01:42:39,716
You look great, Radio.

1316
01:42:39,923 --> 01:42:40,912
Thanks, Mary Helen.

1317
01:42:41,091 --> 01:42:42,854
-l'll see you out there.
-All right.

1318
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,891
-There she go.
-Get your collar down.

1319
01:42:45,062 --> 01:42:47,394
You look good, now.
You look really good.

1320
01:42:47,597 --> 01:42:49,224
You know where we'll be, right?

1321
01:42:49,433 --> 01:42:50,491
All right.

1322
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:54,136
-Do a good job. l'm awful proud of you.
-Okay, coach.

1323
01:42:54,337 --> 01:42:56,271
-There l go.
-Hey, Radio.

1324
01:42:57,207 --> 01:42:59,266
Oh, hey, Johnny, how you doing?

1325
01:42:59,609 --> 01:43:03,272
-l heard you got yourself a letter.
-Yeah, they gave me a letter.

1326
01:43:03,547 --> 01:43:06,983
Me and the boys thought you might
need something to put it on.

1327
01:43:08,785 --> 01:43:10,946
-That for Radio?
-Yeah.

1328
01:43:16,126 --> 01:43:18,594
-How you like that one?
-Looks good on you, man.

1329
01:43:18,795 --> 01:43:21,593
Thanks, Johnny. Thanks, Johnny.

1330
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,067
Hey, congratulations, man...

1331
01:43:27,137 --> 01:43:28,399
...and thanks a lot.

1332
01:43:28,605 --> 01:43:29,473
Patricia Ann Yearwood.

1333
01:43:29,473 --> 01:43:31,202
Patricia Ann Yearwood.

1334
01:43:34,111 --> 01:43:36,341
Thanks, Radio. You're the best.

1335
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,508
Thank you.

1336
01:43:38,715 --> 01:43:43,118
l would also like to extend
a special thank-you...

1337
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,845
...to our honorary graduate...

1338
01:43:46,056 --> 01:43:49,287
...Mr. James Robert Kennedy.

1339
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:56,560
Yeah, Radio! All right!

1340
01:43:56,766 --> 01:44:00,725
Who has decided to return
this coming fall...

1341
01:44:00,937 --> 01:44:04,373
...as an 1 1 th-grade student
at Hanna...

1342
01:44:04,574 --> 01:44:09,637
...where he will be welcome for
as many such years as he so chooses.

1343
01:44:14,351 --> 01:44:17,343
-You got your assistant coach back.
-Yes, we did.

1344
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:22,451
<i>In that moment,
my husband was prouder...</i>

1345
01:44:22,626 --> 01:44:25,595
<i>...than if his team had won
a state title.</i>
